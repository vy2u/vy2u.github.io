today's video is going to be a review of
the new KK Beauty concealer highlighter
and baking and eye brightening under-eye
situation I'm really excited to review
this she's got 16 shades of concealer
the baking powder and as well as a
brightening powder which is like a
3-step kit so I'm excited about it and
just Before we jump in the video I just
wanted to say one quick note and that is
every time I review Kylie or Kim it's
normally a crazy fight in the comic
section with people defending them and
people hating on them and hating on my
review and I just want to say I give an
honest review I've said I didn't like
products from eat one or the other of
them I've said I have liked products
from one of the other them and just
because you like a product doesn't mean
it's not honest am I supposed to hate
every single product they come out with
to please people in a hatred for the
Kardashians no I'm not gonna do it I
pride myself on being an honest beauty
vlogger and I've done that for so long
and I've gone against with other people
upset and thinks I didn't like that
everyone was loving I'm always been very
honest on my channel and so many of you
appreciate that and I appreciate that
you appreciate that cuz I do put myself
out there and give the honest opinion in
the truth and that doesn't change for
these products like I said in the past
I've definitely had moments where I
didn't like a lot of these products and
there's moments that I love them
either way people are like oh she's just
sucking up to them or she's a Kardashian
hater she's just a hater she doesn't
like it so guys I definitely want to
start the video off on a positive note
and I just want all of us to come from a
loving place and be happy and enjoy the
review video whether you love or hate
the Kardashians and one how can you hate
someone that you've never met if you
haven't ever met her I don't have that
energy to put out into the universe I
wouldn't let a human that I've never met
which I haven't met Kim and Kylie but I
wouldn't let that energy from someone
that I don't personally know take from
me I don't know then why are you giving
them your hatred and your energy life is
short let's show some love today and
let's enjoy the review having fun here
it is by the way
look at this big mirror in here too it's
so pretty so as you can see the top row
is two concealers the middle row it's
just the brightening oh sorry the middle
row is the baking in the last row is the
brightening under-eye and then you have
two brushes on the in Lord Jesus and the
arms are not that strong you saw it you
saw it I think him or k'kaw I whenever
she first came out with the line I was
like oh great another Kylie makeup line
like she's just gonna come out with what
Kylie's coming out with and that could
not be further from the truth because I
feel like Kim is that coming out with
products see I can tell that she's more
passionate about contouring Kim is known
known in this industry for years about
her contour chic so she comes out with a
contour stick and it makes sense and
then you know she comes out with her
contour palette it makes sense she's
known for that pretty soft eye and a
glossy lip she comes out with glosses
and lightly glitter for the eye and now
she is really known for that bright
under eye and the baking girl everybody
remembers that picture of her that went
viral with the baking and now she's
coming out with baking products so I
feel like Kim it's coming out with
products that make sense to her and that
people can be like oh yeah of course Kim
would come out with that and the
packaging just looks so kicking it just
looks so Kim I appreciate that about her
brand because I feel like it's not just
popping out random to make money I
feel like she's actually coming out with
stuff that makes sense for Kim to come
out with it's not making sense to you
guys
just trying to put it out there you can
take it in or you can just spit it back
out whatever you want to do with it I'm
gonna say the word concealer wrong 18
million times today we're gonna sing the
subscribe song and then we're gonna jump
right into this video and I'm gonna
start testing it out sure and now let's
jump right into this k'kaw review but it
I'm not gonna lie whenever she first
came out with this I was confused it was
just concealers and I was like way show
you remember you just concealers and I
was talking someone they're like no
honey it's a kit right so I have it
online her site pulled up it says the
kit with the concealer the baking powder
the brightening powder and the two
brushes is 80 bucks the liquid concealer
itself is 18 so I think let's see how
much is in it but I think 0.162 ounces
so actually that's not a lot of
concealer but this is a lower price in
like tar or NARS they have more
concealer in their component but the
price is a lot lower so I would say the
price is more fair the baking powder
alone is 18 again I think that this is a
smaller definitely a smaller baking
powder like alarm RCA but isn't alarm
RCA like 30 something so you know she's
got the price lower with less product
then the brightening powder is 18 as
well so 18 18 18 the brush is
individually or 18 apiece so
everything's $18 so you can get the
whole kit save you some coin for 80
bucks
so again 16 shades of concealer that's
really nice you don't get a ton of
product in the bottle but the price is a
little bit lower for that so I feel like
things are like I like the packaging
it's very on point with k'kaw Beauty I
feel like it at first from this side I
was like does that look cheap and then
it looks like it's like custom-made so I
was like no that were probably expensive
to make and it looks pretty good so I'm
excited about the packaging overall the
concealer packaging it's just right on
point with her brand I could see myself
using this brush I don't really care for
this but just on the brush at all and
then these are these little brushes
right here personally they're just too
small for me like to tap out concealer
like it's a waste of my time personally
no you may like them but I'm just saying
I don't like them but girl this just
looks like a great eyeshadow brush look
at this not mine okay let's carve out
the Browse pack on some shadow blend out
the edge just like this immediately I'm
like yes I shot a brush yeah I did watch
Kim and Laura tutorial on YouTube so I
can make sure I'm using all this the way
it is intended to be you so she did put
on too
siller's but the reason I'm not gonna do
that today is because I feel like people
are not gonna be buying - and if they
buy the kit they only get one so that
wouldn't be fair for me to test out -
and you'd be like I'm only getting one
she is number seven which has a peachy
undertone to cancel out the darkness and
then she put number five on top of that
to brighten it but I'm just gonna use
number five I really think I'm the same
shade as Kim which I feel like I'm cool
I don't okay I don't feel cool we're
gonna do today so they were saying in
the video that this is a very buildable
concealer so if you want to put on just
a little bit and then go back in and add
more you can definitely do that and it
wears well like that so we'll try that
out as well so first he just put not
like a crazy amount by the way can you
guys see the thickness honey that's
thick
come on coverage if this wasn't thick
though I would literally be like girl
baby Doc Kim why I'm impressed with the
thickness already you know I'm a full
coverage girl you know I like that
thickness in the booty on the face I
don't care for this sponge but I'm gonna
use it in case those of you that get the
kit you will see how it performs so here
we go and like I said I just wet the
sponge so I'm just gonna start tapping
it oh wow that is a powerful concealer
you guys can see
okay so number five is very bright on me
but I do like a bright under eyes you
guys know I normally will jump about two
shades lighter than my foundation when
it comes to picking out the concealer
shade the sponge is a little bit hard
for me so I honestly don't think you
need the brushes in your life but if you
want them you can see how they're
performing it's just like a little time
consuming to blend out with this thing
but I think my under eye looks really
beautiful and bright especially right
here I think the darkness is covered the
concealers did blend out really nicely
so so far we are in the good girl her
face is broken out I just want to see
about the buildable Ness of it and I so
I'm gonna go back in with number five
and I think I could just use a little
bit more right through here where I
didn't bring it down this time I'm just
gonna use my wife's six brush and that
way you guys can see a brush blend it
out I just feel like this is blending
out like thirty thousand times faster
with this brush very blendable so I love
actually loving with the concealer so
far I'm excited to see baking powders I
am very particular with my baking
powders I must say like I'm a little bit
picky I'm just gonna add a little bit
more right there
hey I love the way my undereye lives I
think it almost looks flawless it looks
really nice I don't see it creasing it
looks super soft on the skin so she has
four different baking shades to kind of
go with each color category it'll sync
number two is a little more pink and
number one might be a little bit yellow
I think I need to go with shade number
two because that is the category I
picked my concealers in these little
tabs are so hard to get open with baking
powders I like to just pour some out in
the lid now this one is a little bit
more Pinker I have some on my Beauty
Blender and now we're gonna go ahead and
go in I love baking I bake pretty much
every day it's just like a part of my
life right now the feel of this baking
powder is extremely soft like softer
than Laura Mercier I didn't say better I
just said softer then Laura Mercier it
just feels like almost like baby powder
on my face so here I go I'm gonna go
ahead and that's hair dye right there
girl we're gonna work that out later I'm
actually gonna take the other end of
this brush now that let this set here
for about three minutes gonna dust away
the baking powder which is what I
typically do if the baking powder is
really soft and it makes my skin look
velvety so I'm loving that like
absolutely adoring it so I dusted away
the excess I still think my underlying
everything looks really I mean it's just
so soft now we will go on to the number
two brightening powder so this is a step
that I typically don't do and I'm really
excited to try it out and see what
happens is number two brightening powder
it does match the loose baking powder
it's pinky undertone so I'm just gonna
apply some a little bit just tap into a
little bit and just apply it so you're
supposed to leave this it looks like
it's got yeah it's got like a little bit
of lumi to it and that's how you're
supposed to do just a little bit under
the eye this is not meant for baking
that is what I've done what do you guys
think this is my undereye I think it
looks very soft and it covered the
darkness very well which is things that
I look for - I planned on the baking
powder not working as good as I because
I haven't tried --try baking powder so I
didn't think this baking powder was
gonna hold a candle to it but girl it
did the baking powder felt amazing and I
will be using it again in the future I'm
gonna go ahead and set my makeup now you
guys are seeing the close-up of my face
I think it looks so soft and beautiful
and I feel like the powder melts it
right into like look at my forehead it
just melted right into the nose the
forehead really beautifully on the skin
I love the kid to be honest with you the
brushes I don't think you need I think
that they're just there and they're not
necessary I think using your own little
sponges and brushes you'll be fine
the baking powder is amazing the
concealer I would definitely be using a
lot more kind of wish you got more but
that does keep the price down so it's
give and take a brightening powder I did
like a lot which is something I'm not
normal and using like I don't normally
use but I love the way it turned out on
my under eye I'm like yes good and also
doing the math I believe the concealer
is literally what's half in a heart
shape types you're literally getting
half the product but the tart shape take
cost a lot more so like I said give and
take I really like this product and can
I can almost also see myself using the
contant concealers for contour as well
however I used this medium kkw contra
stick all the time it blends out really
easy I'm actually wearing it today it
looks so nice yeah I give this kit to
thumbs up you know if you're not into
k'kaw beauty then don't buy it no one's
forcing you if you do like k'kaw beauty
and you are in the market for the dark
circle coverage and the brightening of
the under eye I really think that you
would like this you do save money
buying it in a kid so if you bought the
brightening powder the concealer and the
loose powder you spend fifty four bucks
would be ninety bucks if you bought it
all individually it'd be ninety bucks we
get the kit you're saving ten bucks
would be 80 bucks but again I don't
necessarily think you Nene need the
sponges and brushes so you know if you
just wanted to get the three pieces you
spend 54 bucks and it wouldn't be as
much
that is my mathematician and how I think
in my head you guys may think about
things differently I'm just trying to
put it out there on the table for you so
this was really cool I liked it hope you
