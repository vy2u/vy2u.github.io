beauty powder contour kids in the mail
and it's time to see the tea on them so
they came in this big oh I didn't even
like say it do my intro I'm just like
I'm excited to try these oh I've heard
hits and misses about them um yeah so I
want to know the tea on them I haven't
even watched them yet I figured save it
all for the video we have three contour
palette and brushes from Kim
Kardashian's beauty line that just
launched of course they're already sold
out at a whopping price point of $52
which is quite a bit higher than what
we're normally dealing with with the
contour kids contour check it's run from
thirty to forty bucks whenever there I
am D they're just kind of like high
high-end ones so I'm hoping they're
gonna live up to that price point in
quality we're gonna test it out I'm
really excited to see the T on it I have
to wipe off not a pretty face makeup I
just do my wipe out my face makeup and
put on my foundation again so that way
you know I have a fresh face to test all
this out on but I'm excited to have some
out I'm excited to tell you guys in my
opinion on them and let you guys see the
real team if they're worth your dolla
dolla bill yo so let's do that but
before we get started we'll go ahead and
jump right into the video
 so heavy like like lifting weights
at the gym like yeah
I'm pre filming a bunch of videos today
because I'm going I like we went to Bora
Bora for a week I come home from two
days I'm going to Fiji for a week hard
life I know but I'm a little stressed
because I still have to do all my things
that I do on my normal lifetime and be
at these vacations so I'm like I swear
Jesus let's take off this makeup let's
just take it off yeah shake it off shake
it off who's excited for Taylor Swift's
new album well we're talking about
celebrities
I thought she tweeted snakes and
reputation so I feel like she's gonna
take a little bite off of drama it's
always a smart marketing ploy you know
people are already talking about you
give them a reason to talk so I'm here
for the album like I haven't even heard
anything off of it obviously but I'm
excited to see what this little mama's
got for us what are you guys saying I'm
gonna go ahead and put on some glossy
air priming moisturizer cuz my skin
needs some moisture as well as it needs
to be primed if I could get it open
there we go
okay her face is ready to rock and roll
opening up the box you can obviously see
we have three kits you like medium and
deep dark with three brushes they come
in a box you know carton like this this
one is the light one it has like the
soft touch fill to it and then you open
it up they feel really heavy and
luxurious I will say that it might be a
weight in them but I love whenever I
spend a lot of money else on the end it
feels heavy luxurious it also has the
soft touch packaging it is a cardboard
component with a big a mirror in it and
I love the big mirror I think that you
know adds a little bit of niceness to it
and then we have the special little
covering to protect the mirror in the
powders and it is a powder product you
have an extremely warm tone from what I
can see here and an extremely cool tone
product here and then you have a pinky
highlight and more of a champagne white
highlight here
let's do swatches oops watching right in
just touching load the pigmentation like
lo the warm one seems super super warm
but we're gonna see what it looks like
Glenna out on the skin and
let's see about the cool tone like
they're pretty extreme differences in
the only little issue I see in that I
mean you can mix them together and use
them but like if you're super fair and
you bought the light one though which
one might be to lunch with you and you
don't get any use out of that I do have
to say the pans are huge compared to you
know a normal contour palettes component
size pans just for you guys to get a
close-up action like if you tell the
pans I'm next my finger or even up next
to a big bronzer brush the pan is still
way bigger than the brush they're huge
pans so maybe that's what she's getting
her price point at so here are swatches
of light so light we have the lightest
highlight the pinky one they look very
similar on the skin and then we have the
warmth home bronzer as well as the cool
tone bronzer so as you can see they are
quite different bronzer shades also
let's talk about the brush I said in my
last review her cream contour product I
wish the brush was double ended and not
a sponge so the brush is really big for
highlight I probably would use a smaller
brush for my highlight but this is
beautiful for bronzer and apparently
they're interchangeable I'm not sure how
to do that next up we have the medium
kit is the same with the hub makeup on
my nails with a soft touch and on the
back it just the same it tells you
having one two point four one two and
it's kind of the same this is super
super warm this looks really pretty for
my skin tone right here and then this is
like a yellowy highlight and then a
pinky a highlight I'm gonna see how that
warm tone swatches but just wrap the bat
I'm like oh but you know why it could be
really pretty to warm up the skin and
instead of contour more so just bronze
out the skin to give you a really pretty
glowy bronzy moment because typically
with something that warm tone I would
brought on my skin to get that beautiful
glow versus like actual contour so I
mean I see what she's doing here and
this might be what she's doing here is
what I'm seeing it as is
you getting the use out of all of your
colors such as you just want to bronze
up your skin or if you want to contour
use the cool tone one so let's watch it
on see what we think
alright here we have the swatches the
pink the yellow highlight
the cool tone and then the contour
number two and one that one shot is
super orange cheap but I'm really
interested in playing with it
I think it could be really cool on the
skin but just looking on it in the
palette it's just like whoa that's
orange but we'll see what happens and of
course lastly we have the deep dark and
deep dark kind of mixed into one palette
here I accidentally got it wet so I'm
wiping off my hand but let's see here
same packaging of course and then we
open it up and then we have a really
bronzy highlight a pink highlight warm
tone and a cool tone for contour one and
two looks like yes the highlights have a
little bit of kick backs watching them
but it's not anything dramatic and
they're swatching really creamy and
beautifully so I personally like a
little kick back I'd rather have a
little kick back meaning a little fall
out with a product versus having to like
scrape and get into it I can't stand
that but then you know you have to have
that medium moment where it's not too
much fall out it's just enough so this
is actually the cool tone and this is
the warm tone right here cool tone room
tone this is the bronzer highlight and
this is the more pink highlight right
here I don't know why on my skin tone
I'm not deep dark obviously but I don't
know what my skin tone and i swatched
the warrant home line it turned like
really dark and it kind of was warmer on
the outer edges of it so that's
interesting and then this is the number
two so if you can see yeah it's just a
little bit of kick up whenever you
swatch I am kind of going round around
in the pan you can see has a little
fallout but it's nothing extreme and
nothing to like fuss about I'm just
stating it so you're aware if you do
purchase it okay so I'm gonna use this
with the brush I'm going to first
actually take some of the warm toned
bronzer on the more angled brush it does
have a little bit of Fallout and the
fallout would be flat if you have it
laying flat but just has a little bit
kick up nothing crazy or to cry about
I'm just showing you guys I love the
mirror in the palette thank you at Kim
for the mirror girl good girl up so on
my face right now I just have on
foundation
concealer in a little setting powder so
here we go with the bronze I'm just
gonna the brush is really soft actually
the orange is too orange
you hear me the UM warm tone is not bad
I like to like see if I'm bronzing up I
just kind of buff it around and go in
with it you guys have seen me bronze up
ten million times on my channel I mean
it's not bad and you know that's me
tapping on in and getting you know a bit
of product on my brush so here we go
over here
I think it looks beautiful I don't know
why it looks so orange in the package it
like scares me I know it even bronze up
my chin area normally the jawline just
kind of around I'm not really being
precise because again whenever I'm not
contouring I am a little bit less
precise what do you guys think this is
it on my skin I don't think it's patchy
whatsoever I think it's really smooth
and like Belen and my skin like butter
what it's a good product it's a good
product it's a little pricey I think but
you do get a ton a product and as I'm
just trying out the first 1g one that I
was hesitant with it looks really pretty
so now I'm gonna take the brush I'm
gonna dip into it the more cool tone
shade just tapping it seems like this
has a little bit less fallout than that
once you want a flicker my brush
normally to catch a mini or to lose any
extra fallout and now we're gonna come
full there's something on my viewfinder
right now it's like a black dot and I
keep wiping my face cuz I think it's on
my face so maybe you find her okay here
we go oh that's intense
pigment honey uh but look it's contoured
and crawl I'm not mad at these colors
you know as for me I am the medium skin
tone I'm using the medium palette and
it's working nicely for me I just
immediately see that orange ii shade in
the light palette and it scares me a
little bit so I'm like
like if I was doing a client's makeup I
wouldn't go in with that once you have a
shade if she had fair skin so that does
make me hesitant its contour my face
like a gym and just being real I like
the brush it's so soft and to be honest
I would like a longer handle in between
the brush but she's trying to make it
travel size so that's just like a
personal preference and I store my
brushes laying down all my brushes lay
down I store them Dantley brushes I
stand up or my eyeshadow brushes so I
don't mind it being double-ended but if
you store your brushes sticking up that
might get on your nerves because it's
just gonna ruin one into the brush I
know a lot of people put them in cups
and stuff but it's for me I lay them
down so I'm feeling like a drawer full
of brushes right here and they're just
like all laid out but I think my skin
looks beautiful I'm just trying to show
you guys like it's just very smooth
filling and it's not like chunks or
patchy if you can tell so let me contour
my nose hmm anything I got too much
product these are so pigmented I'm
actually gonna go with a clean in and
soften that up feel like I'm on my nose
girl you did this to yourself it's okay
we're all human okay and let me point
out something do you see like it's
almost a little bit luminosity in the
powders I knows that on the swatch just
a little bit um they almost have a
little glow and um I think it looks
pretty obviously sound off in the
comments section down below what you
think about it I think is a lot for
contour kit because we have so many
great contour kits on the market for so
much less that's just where I'm getting
at right you're just poped come back
Laura okay next up is for a highlight
I'm really excited
obviously you know I'm gonna try one
highlight on each cheek bone I'm gonna
use her big brush no I prefer like a
thinner wispy brush to get my highlight
so I can get more of a precise area I
feel like the bigger brush it's gonna
kind of explode it everywhere but you
know we're here and this is what you're
gonna get in your kit actually your kit
for 52 you get the brush too so that
does make it a little bit better huh cuz
not really contour kits don't come with
brushes they charge you extra and then
you end up paying more than 50 to you so
maybe that helps a little bit but let's
go in with the pink shade got some on my
brush
whoo oh my god it's so I don't like the
brush boy I just can't do it if you guys
tell it's like just needs to be
dispersed like a more fine brush that's
pretty okay so now I'm wiping up my
brush on my little cloth down here and
now we're gonna tap into the yellow
shade got some of my brush oh it's so
pretty I find that the yellow one is
almost just like oh I put almost too
much of my bow hey girl the Ellen's
almost a little bit more natural put the
yellow this is what I do every time in
my channel I start off with the
cheekbone is that you know the hair all
over my body
Caleb a-ok Realty I really like the
contour palette I think it's pretty if
you a fierce can be a little hesitant of
this color
I think the highlights are really great
for fair skin I approve the product if
you get the brush with it and all I
approve the product I think it's a great
product I think she killed it they're
already sold out and they'll continue
sell out but if you're looking for a
contour if you here's the T if you
already have makeup brushes and you're
like the makeup brushes is in a park for
me because you don't have to have the
brush to make this work let me promise
you that it's a contract and you just
don't feel like the brush is worth it
for you well then $52 there's too much
for it but if you really need to makeup
brushes and you really want to try out a
new contour brush and you really want
the brush with it and you would like buy
a contour kit with a brush at this point
then $52 is with it and another thing
the pan size is huge that this is gonna
last you longer than a typical contour
kit as you guys hear me talk about all
the time of my channel and to bronze up
my skin and then sometimes I'm really
contouring so I do like that she
incorporated both in this palette I'm I
know that's the way her Mario does her
makeup you know they bronzed up they
contour a little bit of both so it's all
like pros and cons it's all about your
situation in the price point
whenever I first heard it I was like no
too much but the brush comes with it and
the pans are huge and the palette is
heavy and it feels luxurious and that
you know card and everything is nice I
just wanna find I hate brushes apart oh
alright you can clean the brush that was
one of my complaints before all it's
kinda like oh that's kind of like is pop
right out and then you click them back
in okay I like that little
interchangeable brush it's a cool kit
but that's it for my review guys I love
you guys so much thank you for being
here and watching and I'll see you in my
next video it's not a gimmick okay it's
not a gimmick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
