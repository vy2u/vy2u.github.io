bit of it already and I can't wait to
tell you guys my thoughts also before
really getting to this video come on in
focus yep my fingernails are busted you
see that bust and you might say Laura
when she just sticks them that's because
I went to the beach all day and rode
bikes instead of getting my nails done
because I wanted it I don't enjoy
getting my Nelsen that's just me I
actually hate it and I know that's weird
but I don't and I want to show you
something that I enjoyed today which is
going to the beach which I love to
exercise then go to the beach there and
and exercise and do that there so I'll
say I'll just take off the nail polish
and do plain nails for the video and
then I don't have any nail polish
remember isn't that just life so I was
like well these are just gonna be my
nails and I'll target stayed open till
midnight tonight so I'll probably go to
Target house like 8:30 probably gonna
target tonight maybe and uh go get some
nail polish remover and some more
Christmas decorations it's going to go
live tomorrow and I want you guys to

head and I forgot so yes ma'am we're
gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE song today yeah
subscribe holding my boob okay let's
jump into the video
all right so first I know you guys this
is a hot topic someone talked about this
this is the wet set from Kylie Jenner
this is her second wet set and I'm
pretty sure yeah these colors are
different than the first one so I'm
going to open it if you don't know if
you feel if you didn't know if you feel
these highlighters they feel wet and
they are very pigmented I know you guys
can already see I've already played with
this set a little bit and the pan size
is really big so that's super nice in it
and this wet set is a little bit more I
believe it cost around 65 bucks the
packaging is ABS oh you already know I
love the silver Sparkle but this sauce
is whole pretty I saw and I was like
love it you guys know that's right up my
alley so I'm gonna go ahead and swatch
all these for you I will tell you this
is probably the best color from my skin
tone which is medium the other two were
just a tad bit light for me and then
this I could use kind of like a glowy
bronze but not so much as a highlighter
on my cheekbone look at that busted
fingernail but anyways this one right
here is really the best for medium skin
tone a really cool thing about these I
find that they don't dry out and I just
think that's so cool they just really
don't like my other ones are just fine
so here is swatches if you can see what
the light hits it this is just a little
bit too dark for me this one's kind of a
Goldy pink this one is a little white
pink and this is like a white frosted
blue iridescent to it so they're really
interesting pretty colors and I think
they're very pretty so I'm gonna go
ahead and apply
sweet dreams to my face so you guys can
see how it looks on the face cuz I
already have my foundation and all that
good good on honestly I like to apply
with my finger I was reaching for a
brush but I actually like to apply these
my finger better okay I just keep
showing off this bus it finger because I
want you guys to I just wanna be
relatable and for you guys to understand
that you know you're so we're gonna live
in my fingernails are living too so if
you can see I just you can just rub it
on with your finger you don't really
need a brush with these I always put a
little bit on my forehead and around my
hairline and I think that they're just a
really pretty highlight you can build
these up as well
ha ha ok I just looked at me like an
idiot
shut up okay now we're gonna show off
these eyeshadow palettes we have
naughty/nice I think that's the cutest
thing in the world just the duos I'm
kinda with my brand working on something
nots definitely not similar to this but
I don't know I'm kind of working on uh
a situation that's all I'll say okay
that's all I'm gonna give so first you
have naughty/nice the packaging is so
cute definitely opposite this reminds me
of the leaves of awfully what's the
plant there's super poisonous but
everybody has them at the holidays what
are they someone tell me I'm and then
the nice one she's super pretty with the
silver and white first up we have
naughty if you guys did knows velvet the
words were velvet and then you open it
up this one doesn't come with a brush
which I'm totally fine with pallets
coming the brush sometimes the bursts
are good sometimes they are I really
don't care about the brushes that's just
me though that's just my opinion so here
are the colors very Christmassy I really
like the green and of course you know
I'm a sucker for the Reds and
cranberries in there so I'm gonna swatch
that but first next I want to show you
nice so nice the words are written in
velvet and the bubbles are velvet as
well and then along the brim long the
brim is the silver oh okay I guys gotta
say like first off this one's probably
my favorite out of the both but I think
they're both really pretty really liked
every palette that kylie's come out with
it's set for the purple palette and the
only reason like it's just because the
collar
I like the colors individually in the
palette just the combo just something I
wouldn't ever go for and again that's a
personal opinion so these I love I think
they're great and yeah I'm gonna swatch
them for you I'm just gonna stand up for
this part so you guys can get a really
good vision of all the colors they're so
pretty and that duochrome right there
girl got me screaming the mats were
super pigmented and they pretty much
feel like all kylie jenner's I should
have House feel no difference in
quality's really good creamy eyeshadows
alright here is the knotty palette and I
just feel like this one is the more bold
palette of the two
Green did swatch a little bit patch of
it to be honest that's all I felt super
creamy on and why it's watched like that
and like I said all my videos it really
matters how it applies on the eyes not
how its watches but this is just a good
overview of the color next up I'm going
to show you guys swatches of all the
sugar lip colors and this is personally
my favorite collection out of the sugar
and spice collection and there is a
color called savage in here which is
which is this guy right there and it's
actually my favorite color of the whole
collection I've been wearing it non-stop
so here's the collection you get the
tubes you get the two glitter lip
stoppers right here ones golden wants
more pink champagne they're really
pretty I prefer to wear them on their
own and then you get the savage which I
love so much and then the savage angel
and boy buy so savage is a lip velvet
and to me lip Velvets are ten times more
comfortable than her liquid lipsticks
this down here this red color it comes
in its own kit it's called red velvet
the kit looks like this and it comes
with the liner which are swatch right
beside it just super bold but pretty red
for the holiday season nonetheless here
comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
dances down okay here is spice and now
I'm gonna swatch all the closure spots
and show you guys a little bit of teeth
obviously this is the more red
collection and the deeper collection but
it still has a lot of neutrals in it now
the collections have a mixture of the
liquid lipsticks as well as the liquid
velvet so I really like that you get a
mixture and like I've said a million
times before I adore her lip velvet but
the liquid lipsticks are just a wee bit
dry right here are the swatches of the
spice collection as you can see they're
a lot deeper but they're very very
pretty and you get two glosses in the
collection two liquid lipsticks and a
lip velvet that is swatches of
everything in the collection make it
back okay I have this makeup bag in
black and I like it alive and gets good
quality and then it has the Kylie on it
so you get the green obviously because
it's for Christmas time so it's that
what do you call this green I've owned a
brain fart it's not emerald it's uh like
forest green I call it I don't know that
made me laugh that's gonna call out for
green a little pocket in there
little spacious bang so I believe she
sells the whole collection yeah she says
oh my gosh look and in the PR there was
an ope if you guys were wondering what
was in here she's peppermints and I want
to eat one right now but it's really bad
etiquette for you guys to watch me
slurping on a peppermint the whole
videos I'm not gonna do it thank God you
can't smell my breath through the
control in it anyways I'm gonna zoom in
a little bit now and film a little
tutorial with I think I'm gonna use the
nice I shoulda palette hmmm yeah I think
I'm gonna use a nice I should've held my
eyes but first you gotta take off these
lashes oh my good
I've taken off the makeup that I had on
my eyes and I just prime my eyes with
this little Smashbox 24-hour eyeshadow
primer the first color I'm gonna go in
right here is miracle I'm gonna use an e
27 brush you guys know I like to apply
just a neutral nellie color all over my
lid to start oh my gosh this color is
really light though hmm well that's what
first impressions are all about right oh
Jersey whoa easy next I'm gonna take
Santa Baby
okay I'm gonna apply this as my
transition shade these are really
pigmented so mover with you you need to
go in with a light hand because like I
feel like I'm already going in with too
heavy of my hand getting a little bit
too much color but I'm gonna buff it out
anyways this is a morphe m57
3 brush and what i'm going to do is just
pop this into the crease I'm just gonna
blend it out when shield wiper motions I
always like to buff in colors like in a
circular motion on the outer corner and
then I like to go back and forth if you
have smaller eyelids umm I recommend
using not the m57 3 but using the r36
brush because there's just a little bit
of a smaller blending brush but it has
like the exact same type of raspbian
bristles it I like a lot next I'm gonna
go in with gingersnap right here this
yellowy color I'm such a sucker for a
yellowy mustard I don't know what it
I've no idea what look I'm doing by the
way I just so you guys are aware of it
just such a sucker for a yellowy mustard
and if you can see I'm just like pushing
the color in so we can get as much color
payoff as possible and then I'll soften
up the edges using that same
rush I honestly can't help it dip into
this duochrome color blizzard like
whenever ice washed it I was just like
girl yes I grabbed it in four to one
brush this is a flat synthetic brush
which is great for applying a color on
the lid I'm gonna swirl it around the
color and if you look whenever you swirl
this around you get a little bit kick up
but it's not that big of a deal and
honestly this color duochrome sometimes
not all the time sometimes may be a
little bit dry so I like to hit it with
a mac fix+ spray to help dampen it you
don't have this at home you can also use
water to just apply this to the lid yes
color
it's like purple with champagne sparkle
I don't know it's kind of hard to
describe
um I was I'm into say an r36 brush early
when I'm out for smaller eyelid so I'm
gonna take a our 36 brush I mean I still
say it wrong and our 39 brush law and
our 39 our 36 the highlighter brush so
now I'm gonna go in with a wonder lion
water lion see how Wonderland and
because this corner just needs and it's
like something I'm gonna pop this right
there you can see I'm really pressing it
in
one amandime you can see there's just a
little bit of fall out I'm gonna flicker
that right off with a light fluffy brush
and I'm going to apply a little more
mascara and some lashes and I'll be
right I'm gonna take em to tin brush and
I'm gonna grab that Wonderland color
which was the dark maroon I'm just gonna
apply that on the lower lash line next
I'm gonna take this a pretty vulgar
liner but mind you I still have to put
on some mascara I'm gonna put this in my
watching line next I'm gonna take Jack
Frost and apply that on the inner corner
of my eye and a little bit on my brow
bone just to really woo give it a pop
and open up my eyes this is duochrome
maybe but it's still really pretty it's
like Oh white I mean a gold reflective
with in it this is a m5 one at five
brush in case you guys are wondering and
for my lips I'm gonna put on my favorite
color from the collection which is Saba
drop Samaj alright guys that is it for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed the
video and I hope it gave you some
insight on this collection I like the
collection I think it's really nice I've
