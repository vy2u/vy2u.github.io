channel today's video is very exciting
because we are gonna be talking about a
brush set that has caused quite the
chaos on the Internet today I'm gonna be
reviewing the Kylie Jenner infamous $360
brush set I have them right here they're
on his glass rakes they were sent to me
in PR I do plan on doing a makeup look
testing out the brushes with you
obviously I haven't tested them they're
still stuck to the board they came in
last night and I figured I would film
this video and get it up for you guys so
you guys can see the T on the infamous
brush set
the fuss is that this brush set is three
hundred and sixty dollars and I think
everybody knows that Kylie is using
colourpop's labs to create her makeup
but she is up charged the make up
compared to colour-pop a bit but never
this dramatically granted this a brushes
and not make up but her price point this
is just way out of the room then she
tweeted something about other brush
companies have similar brush prices and
she named a couple super high-end
companies and I just don't think the
Internet is considering her a Kevin a
Quan or super deluxe brand they're
considering her color pop with a little
bit of an upcharge because her name's on
the product I don't think Kylie sees it
that way and that's machine has these
brush is so expensive she said these are
real hair brushes versus synthetic
brushes and that's why they cost so much
but in the future she might do synthetic
brushes so there will be a more of a
cheaper price rate there is a grand
total as sixteen brushes and many brush
companies have come out with duplicate
sets I went in and found my individual
dupes I actually spent my whole morning
digging through this box brushes right
here oh it's heavier than it looks
and finding dupes which at the end of
the video if you guys hang out to the
end I'm gonna go through all the dupes
for each brushes and hopefully get you
some more affordable price options out
there
my dupes are synthetic they aren't real
hair verses these are being real hair so
sorry about that in my studies I've
found that a lot of Sigma brushes are
the exact same price it's not a dollar
cheaper than Kylie and no one gives
Sigma a big fuss but I think they
discount their bundles and Kylie
probably should have discounted this
bundle a lot I can't really say it's not
my brand
know what the cost of this product was
but the Internet's pissed but anyways I
thought I would just mention that to you
guys and let you guys be woke and aware
that if you look up Luxy brushes Sigma
brushes Real Techniques they're kind of
the same prices it's Kylie's so let's go
ahead and jump right into testing them
up I know people are upset but don't
feel like anyone's twisting your arm
behind your back and making you buy
these brushes I know a lot of people are
big friend of Kylie and they want the
collection and they're disappointed when
they see the price but don't feel like
you have to have every piece don't feel
like now you're stuck having to buy this
$360 brush kit because you're not you
don't have to buy anything that I
advertise in my channel or that I talk
about my channel and I don't want you
guys to feel that way and you don't have
to buy this brush set and you don't have
to buy all the makeup coming out really
go through pick and choose what you
really really want want think about it
and spend your money wisely so that's my
advice to you guys so you don't feel
like you're forced to buy makeup so
without further ado I'm gonna sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and we're gonna jump
right in be sure red subscribe
yeah subscribe and now let's go ahead
and jump right
okay first things first I'm gonna go
ahead and call it this is the cheapest
brush bag I've I don't want to say
they've ever felt but guys this brush
bag is rough this looks like it came out
of the Dollar Tree and that is something
I'm gonna go ahead and argue the case
like it should be so much nicer for the
price of the brush kit this brush bag is
a joke like honestly I wouldn't want
this at all the brushes however I have
felt across them and they feel extremely
soft they feel not heavy really not
really heavy I wouldn't say they feel
really soft and really nice and I'm sure
that they perform nice but still got
that price point oh I'm gonna have so
much fun pulling off the sticky it's
like so relaxing do you guys love doing
that okay let's get started with makeup
so I'm gonna go ahead and dab some of
the laura mercier a flawless fusion
foundation on my face and then we're
gonna test out her stippling brush when
she says online can use with any cream
product and we're gonna go ahead and
blend this out one thing I notice about
this collection and I was kind of like
there's no kabuki type brush and that's
what I've always used to blend my
product out we were gonna use this
instead today as though it was
interesting for the price point there
was no Kabuki brush just feel like the
bristles are super raspy and very sorry
I can't breathe I have like makeup going
on on my nose very uh similar to
synthetic brush hairs you know even
though they're not they feel about the
same and so here is the brush just a
simple stippling brush it did blend out
the foundation nicely as brushes $30 and
I personally don't think it's worth $30
next up for concealer whenever you put a
price point that high people expect a
lot and I would expect a kabuki or
something to blend this out you guys
could get creative I think and use one
of the brushes potentially but I mean
honestly no like I I wouldn't
next up we have number three the medium
tapered brush I'm gonna go ahead and set
some powder on my under-eye I mean the
brush is really soft but there's
definitely like not too much special
about it like there's no bristles
falling out or anything like that I
noticed so I do like that about it but I
wouldn't personally buy it for the price
on it I'm gonna take number four the
dense powder brush which is $26 and I'm
gonna go ahead and bronze up my skin
with it this brush is definitely dense
and if you can see there's no brush
hairs falling out I mean I'm trying to
say here I think the brushes are that of
good quality I think they're super soft
but there's also a bazillion similar
brushes on the market that are just as
soft and just as good of quality so it's
kind of like I'm just gonna go ahead and
bake you a Q a little bit when I take a
little bit of blush on the number 5 this
is her angled brush this is $24 and
honestly this brush I don't know it's
just so small it doesn't look like it's
$24 the gag of the century definitely
feels nice on the face and I do like
that it's smaller cuz I'm a small head
and sad blush I don't feel like the
blush is exploding everywhere so it's
nice I'm gonna take the medium stippling
brush which is number seven I guess I
could have used this one for concealer
huh I just typically would never use a
brush like this for concealer like I
said you can use creative and use
whatever for whatever you want but I
don't know I'm gonna take logos from
Oprah and the number nine not number six
hello number nine fan brush with just
$20 and it does perform well
we are officially into eyeshadow I'm
gonna take this really big fluffy brush
this is number ten which is actually
called the large shader brush this is a
20 no yep $20 brush I'm gonna go in with
okie-dokie from cat's pajamas I like to
play apply this shade all over my lid
because it softens up the primer I'm
gonna take number 15 which is a tapered
blender and this is a $20 brush I'm
gonna tap into a bong pop this happened
to a bomb diggity and cray cray like
it's definitely you know blending very
nicely it's a $20 brush so individually
it doesn't seem like I mean that is
pricey for a brush no doubt but it
doesn't seem so bad
but never you put certain things
together whoa start thinking again guys
don't forget to hang out to the end of
the video I have a dupe set up for every
brush so if you guys want to hang out
towards the end do you guys ever watched
the video in fast speed that's like the
only way i watch youtube videos should
go to your quality settings a little nut
looking screw down at the bottom and you
go to the quality and then you can go to
V to the speed of the video and you can
speed it up that's just how I watch all
my youtube videos there I got a lot of
videos to watch and I ain't got a lot of
time what what do a small concealer
brush number 18 and I'm gonna use this
to cut my crease I don't know about you
guys so I guess you could definitely use
this brush for concealer I just
personally prefer a small kabuki or a
kabuki brush in general not a brush like
this I'll use a brush like this to apply
eyeshadow or to pack on color some of
you guys may think this is a great
concealer brush so I'm not trying to
sway opinions I'm just trying to say
well this girl right here will use it fo
okay okay okay I'm now gonna take the
medium shader brush which is 20 number
12
I'm gonna go back in with okie-dokie
which was the first color we use which
was just the white shade
let me go back in on this concealer
brush I need a synthetic brush to do
this look I caught us and etic brush
into real hair brush I'm gonna go back
in with this concealer brush to cut my
crease a little sharper I also noticed
there is no liner brush in this kit so
just a heads up on that I'm gonna take
this smaller shader brush go into a
quirky which is the purpley shimmer
shade and in honor of reviewing Kylie
we're gonna go ahead and apply a naked
to my lips
just for fun I'm going to apply a little
bit of ACDC to the under lower lash line
under eye and I'm going to take the
pencil brush number 16
grab some scatterbrain which is this
gold shade right there and hit it in the
inner corner and just a little on the
brow bone as well okay guys that is it
for this look and now we're gonna talk
brushes we're gonna talk about the dupes
and basically I'm gonna show you guys
what I came up with with dupes for these
brushes so number one we have the powder
brush I think this is definitely the
most expensive is a almost $50 which i
think is a little cray-cray this is the
powder brush supersoft but I found a
dupe and this is the Sigma f28 it's a
large powder brush feels super similar
to that one maybe a little bit softer so
this one it runs for 34 bucks the next
tip is number two the stippling brush
that I have a dupe for the dupe I found
is the f50 from Sigma no granite you're
only saving $1 her brush is 30 and the
f50 is 29 and this is what I was talking
about Sigma brushes are her like
basically Kylie versus they're the same
price eccentric Kylie's is real hair
these are synthetic they feel very
similar the brush tip for number three
which is the medium tapered it's a $28
brush it's the r5 from morphe it does
spread out a little bit more this one's
really clean and put together so it's
kind of chiseled at the top but it is a
little more fluffy and I think it works
performs the same it is 1350 her angled
brush is number five is 24 bucks the
elite collection from morphe which is
the nicest collection they have their
angled brush is $14 which is to e4 brush
and they're super similar the four is
just a little bit larger and it's even
way more soft however these are a little
bit more raspy feeling anyways that's
just the texture of her brushes which I
don't mind I do like raspy brushes but
um yeah that is a doobie Doo so we have
number six which is $28 and number six
is the rounded base brush versus the art
14 brush right here from morphe which is
$9.99 so you're saving a lot of money
they're both dense brushes they both
have that rounded shaped tip and they
both are very very soft brushes over
seven is the medium simple brush and
that is $22 the gag of the century I
found a dupe from elf the elf one is a
105 brush and the brushes almost look
identical and they feel if your eyes
were closed I think you would say the
Ellen was softer the fan brush from
Sigma is 18 the fan brush from Kylie is
20 you're saving $2 and they're almost
identical feeling the Sigma one might be
just a little bit smaller number 10 is
the large shader from Kylie which is 20
and the 20 brush from Sigma is $12 and
it's from the elite collection and if
you're looking at them side-by-side
they're identical besides the color
number eight brush from Kylie is the
small fluffy brush which is number it's
22 bucks sorry I'm like 20 bucks the
white n brush is a little bit more dense
and a little bit shorter but very
similar and the white n brush is $8 so
it saves you a ton of money yeah this
one's just a little bit more dense like
but the bristles are softer on the
little bit softer on the morphe because
it is that kabuki type filling versus
the raspy bristles here's a huge tube
number 16 is a small smudgy
brush it's 18 bucks versus the morphe
m57 4 which is 5 dolla so 18 versus $5
and you can look at those bristles they
look almost the exact same miss dupe
saves you 2 bucks
18 dollars for the concealer brush for
hello Kylie how do I forget her name
it's a number 4 and then the Sigma F 75
is 16 bucks so $72 we can see the top of
the brushes are rounded and very similar
here's a huge dupe to these brushes are
super similar at the tip number 13 from
Kylie Jenner this is a small shader
brush and it is $18 and the morphe 210
brush is two dollars and fifty cents
whoa another huge tip is the number 15
at Kylie brush is $20 is it tapered
blending and then we have the AR 38
which is six I had to check my list
sorry but we have the are at 36 brush
from morphe which it does blend out
bigger once you get it going this one is
clean and it's six books the r39 brush
from morphe is six dollars the number 12
brush which is the a medium shader is 20
the dupe that I found for the Kylie
Jenner number eleven brush cost the
exact same so sorry guys I kind of
flopped on this dupe it is an angled
brush they're both 16 bucks and they
both look super similar I had a hard
time finding a really affordable do for
number 11 so if you guys have any advice
on that please comment down below and
save us all a little moolah so that's it
for this video guys I mean to $360 I
don't want anyone to feel pressure to
ever spend that much on makeup brushes I
would it they worsened to me I wouldn't
pay that much for them they are very
soft they did perform very well they
were nice brushes no doubt they didn't
really feel like they had much of a
weight to them but the price I her
prices are aligned with a lot of other
brush companies but I get it people just
aren't seeing her brand as that looks
however I feel like Sigma isn't like a
super super luxe brand and her brushes
are kind of a lot of the brushes are in
line with the prices the Sigma brushes
which was interesting but I mean that's
up to you guys and what you guys think
about it thank you so much for being
here and watching I hope this video was
