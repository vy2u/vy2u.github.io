it says be doing a makeup tutorial you
guys like my sleeps today they're like
um what is that
wait what is that did I get makeup on a
shirt oh it's just a lash hey guys
what's up and welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be a review of
the new kylie jenner or purple
collection I guess you could call it
like her fall collection of makeup we
have 4 highlighters that are loose
highlighters and I shoulda palette and
4/5 I don't know how to count liquid
lipsticks to review today and I'm super
excited to try out this makeup out ok
also we have five days until my larlie
Los Angeles palette launches and OMG
shameless self-promoter
i had to do it I have to say it can't
help that real excited about it you guys
already know that anyways umm Before we
jump into this video we're gonna sing a
little song subscribe to my channel
today and become a lolly now we can go
ahead and jump right into this video
first things first I'm gonna try out
some of these lip colors and the
highlights and then we'll jump into the
palette so first I'm once you try out
honestly this color autumn which doesn't
necessarily remind me of an autumn shade
it's just a pretty name it's more of a
Selman reddish pinkish oranges undertone
color I don't know it's a weird
description for this color let me get my
mirror of course we can actually see
what she's doing now this comes in the
Kylie Jenner lip kids and the lip kids
box I think this is the box to it are
black for this collection which I think
it's very pretty here we have autumn on
the lips it is a really pretty color and
I know it looks just a little bit weird
with me applying this to my lips and not
any eyeshadow on but I thought we never
try out lips first lips always get the
butt and the thing so why not try them
out first plus I think that's what most
people are excited for when it comes to
Kylie Jenner's for lip products here's
autumn on my lips and I think it's
really pretty all of my wipes are dried
out okay next I'm gonna show you out
butternut and I think butternut matches
the color exactly reminds me of a
caramel butternut what's that
butterscotch that's I'm thinking of
butterscotch candy
it's like Diddy yellows a very
interesting lip color let me line the
top of my lips at least girl this is
yellow this will be a really pretty eye
shadow shade don't know if I'll
personally be wearing this one every day
but let's be real she's come out with
boo qoodles of gorgeous lip colors and
she's trying to have a little bit of fun
with this one which is completely
understandable so this is definitely a
more fun shade this one is butternut
again and it's more of a yellowy orange
color I think it makes my teeth look a
little bit yellow so I'm part personally
will be wearing this one that much but
it is a fun shade and like I said she's
come out with so many wearable Shea it's
like it's time to have a little bit of
fun honey boo boo our next color is
hazel this one is a really pretty brown
shade is a lighter brown shade I still
have a little bit of butternut on the
side of my mouth it's embarrassing I
feel like this one is very very wearable
and a pretty full-time color however
this one reminds me of a beautiful
transition shade
I shout out for whatever reason but I
think it's really pretty it's a very
pretty nude color
you know when I'm singing it's pretty
next up is a very light shape from the
collection this one is Libra and this is
a super white out nudie patootie color I
think this one might be too nude for me
but let's try it out and see what
happens yeah this coach way too nude for
me however I will probably wear
something like this on my lips with a
little bit of a darker liner maybe I
could wear it in the center of my lips
but as far as wearing it by myself it's
way too nude for me unless I saved the
darkest for last this is a wicked which
i think is such a cute name now she did
come out with a purple shade this summer
I can't remember the name of that one
but this one seems to be a little bit of
a darker purple this one took two layers
of color to get it down and not be
patchy but he's not that patchy purples
are really hard colors to get to go on
smooth and I clearly didn't do that but
you can see it's just a little bit
patchy and on a third so maybe three
totes to get it yeah I would say three
coats of this color to get it completely
down right overall as you most do you
guys know that with the kylie jenner
liquid lipsticks you must you already
know my opinion on I think they are
quite drying form of a liquid lipstick
however if you wear a lip liner with
them or coat your whole lip with the lip
liner and then apply it I find that they
stay on for a really long time and most
the time we look at lipsticks the more
drying out they are the longer they last
on your lips
these don't crumble as much I am losing
some skin on my lip and that's because
I've tried on so many colors my lips are
like pissed off they're like please we
leave us alone
they don't really crumble they crack a
little not too much and see it's still a
little patchy hmm kind of patchy or all
they're pretty good liquid lipsticks
just a bit drying the only thing I hate
and I cannot tell you how many I'm not
just pinpointing Kylie out with purples
and stuff I mean I've had this color on
for three minutes and my lips are
stained and I hate that I hate how fast
they stain your lips let's move on to
the highlight Tom to get blended well at
least we hope so these are the
highlighters they came in the black
packaging which i think is cute and now
these are
loose highlighters so they sprinkle out
and I like a loose highlighter I know
they are a little more messy of course
than a compacted anything that's loose
pigment is a little more messy but I
personally like a loose highlighter I
think sometimes they could be more
blinding hopefully these will be so
let's try out the colors the first color
I'm going to try out is Oh as with Syria
it's alright so let me just be real
wisteria it's pretty it just got lots of
pure glitter in it but very pretty
you know like super blinding but dude
that's glitter and this one's white with
like very like faint undertone to it
like it feels super chunky just being
honest here with you guys I don't think
I'm gonna die for wisteria we have
Santorini okay see this Santorini is
more of a fine grain powder rather than
a glitter and it's just super super
super light so it might be too light for
me next we have Tahiti mmm Tahiti is
pink oh I think Tahiti is gonna be my
favorite Tahiti is a really pretty
blinding golden undertone pink
whenever you sprinkle it on it's pink
and then it has like that iridescent
golden under tone - it's really pretty
Fiji Fiji looks like it's gonna be gold
yeah Fiji is gold with like a champagne
undertone I won't say like a white
frosty in her tone it's like almost gold
would like a little bit of a champagne
to it so it's very very very pretty so
far
Fiji and um Tahiti
oh my oh that was all of them what's
that all of them why did I think there
was five what am I doing here
I'm gonna put Tahiti on my face
sprinkling some out oh I'm gonna take a
earth an urge in earth 36 an hour 36
brush what I like to do is tap it on the
brush and then tap off the excess yeah
this is definitely my favorite I think
it's so pretty again this is Tahiti I
put too much on you guys know I do that
that's what I'm good I'm good at putting
too much I hate that my lips are pink
right now I knew I shouldn't have tried
that purple shade but I did it for
YouTube I think it's pretty you know
because it's such a fine grain powder
instead of like chunky it looks so
melted
to the skin I haven't even hit it with a
big plush yet all right so let's hit it
with some setting spray mm-hmm guys know
I like to Pat it out that looks even
more melted into my skin me likey
next up and lastly we have her palette
no I was not picking my nose you guys
know I have a OCD thing where I like
think my nose is itching at all times
while filming and I constantly do this
maybe it really is itching you know no
one knows anyways here is her palette
they out oats let me show you the ball
the palette is um just like her other
ones that the purple is raining down
instead the other colors I love that she
now has mirrors in her palette like it's
kind of a no for me if you don't put
mirror in a palette because it's 2017
mirrors don't cost a lot there should be
a mirror in the palette and so here are
the colors that we have so the power to
me is fun you know she's done so many
eyeshadow palettes are ready and created
so many colors so I kind of get that
she's got you know in a different
arrangement of colors in this palette
I'll say this isn't I how can I put this
this palette doesn't necessarily go
together for me however I feel like
she's create somebody's palettes that do
go together perfectly and match and you
know are very cohesive cohesive that
maybe it's time for her to have some fun
and mix up the colors that don't go
together so good for you Kylie I think
the color is actual individually they're
beautiful so I want to try them out now
I will tell you personally this is not
fact that this is there's a fly there's
a gnat in here and if you guys see him
on camera just know I have bugs okay
anyways personally these are not colors
that I go to which kind of makes me
excited to use it maybe upgrade a look
that I normally wouldn't create get
right here it's like larlie happy
comfort zone these two yeah I'm excited
about these so that means I'm gonna have
to use some of these to get out of my
comfort zone because nothing great
happens in your comfort zone oh my god
the magnet just snatched my earring what
here is the whole entire palette swatch
the purple down in this bottom corner
at the top well here we go here we go
the purple at the bottom corner down on
the other side is more of an iridescent
purple which is swatched right there and
then the other Matt's watch so
beautifully and then her shimmers again
are very consistent with her other
eyeshadows they I like Kylie eyeshadows
I think she does a great job with a
formula so yeah look at that
super purpley and then it has some hits
of white this pink shade and the palette
actually comes out so white the brown
color is very cool tone again it's just
not it's like almost the brown is almost
gray on me sometimes Browns do that they
just swatch gray on me with a medium
skin tone all right miss Jenner let's
see what you got Amy to be very honest
with you this palette doesn't have
necessarily a transition shade I would
use because this color is coming off
super dark and grey on me and then this
is too white so I'm going to dip into
cat's pajamas and just grab a little bit
of bomb-diggity which is this transition
shade I just need a brown color to put
down so I'm just gonna grab bomb diggity
and just get the look started and that
way we can start off on a good foot next
I'm going to take a little bit of this
purple shade right here and I'm gonna
push it in to the oh very pigmented I'm
gonna push it into the outer corner like
that and this is an r 39 brush which is
one of my favorite blenders so if you
guys can see this color is so pretty
very very pigmented and like the more I
built it if you can see it's almost kind
of gray and dark in there so the more
you build this up the deeper it gets to
deepen up just a wee bit more I'm gonna
go in with a center shade and this same
brush just pop it right there doing any
big movements here because I don't want
this dark color to explode everywhere I
want to keep it kind of right where I'm
putting it and strategically placing it
in a certain area and I don't want it to
blend out so if you can see I'm doing
really
tiny motions to make sure it doesn't go
crazy and what I'm dragging poured is
honestly whatever is leftover on my
brush I'm not gonna like add a lot more
color going inward I kinda wanna I don't
know what I want to do with this look
actually I'm gonna go in with a little
bit of the gray color down at the bottom
with the same brush and just keep making
a darker and darker right I'm gonna grab
my handy-dandy Paint Pot and soft ochre
I think I used to call this soft or Chur
pretty sure because you guys know I like
to make up names for things that aren't
true but I'm pretty sure used to call it
that and someone told me yeah its soft
ochre honey baby so now I thought it's a
poker and I'm gonna put some of this
down to cover up all this dark
eyeshadows we can put on a shimmer I'm
gonna take this purple shimmer shade
right here down this bottom corner which
was more than iridescent ones but I'm
gonna hit it with some mac fix+ and get
the most pigment out of it that we can
match rest in that fix plus there's a
morphe at four to one and I'm just gonna
pack this on again I have wet the color
uh so this color does go on kind of
light you definitely have to build it up
but it doesn't build up really nicely
and it looks so pretty
once you've added a few layers of it I'm
gonna go back in with the purple shade
that we we have a little bit of fallout
but that's okay compared to how much
darkness I put on my eye a little bit of
files normal I'm gonna go back in with
the two purple shapes that I used in the
beginning and just smooth out this
transition right here I'm gonna go in
with my appart a a vulgar little ink
liner it's so cute it looks like a
little ink pot this is a dose of colors
liner brush I like the really fine liner
brushes I find just helps me do a better
job here is one wing I like it was a
winged liner I think and I'm gonna go
ahead and put on the other way and I'll
be right back
and some lashes I'm also gonna add some
lashes for lashes I'm gonna use these
Arab iris beauty and lashes and these
are called Athena these are cruelty free
silk lashes
with a lower lashline I'm gonna mix
these two colors together and I'm gonna
blend it out baby lastly I'm gonna go in
with this pink shade and highlight the
inner corners in my brow bone her lips
I'm gonna add some Mac strip-down liner
and I'm gonna take Libra and apply it to
the center of my lips and this kind of
makes your pout look a little fuller
hopefully this will turn out as planned
in my head but things don't always do
that so because my lips are stained so
bad from that purple I just feel like
this looks like crap like honestly I
just feel like there's pink coming
through which makes me sad so I'm gonna
take some hazel which was that brown
shade should I cover it that's a little
better but I'm low-key annoyed about
that pink it's coming through all the
way around you know my nerves I'm gonna
add some of the voluminous last parade
eyes to my lashes this is the final look
so two out of four highlighters I did
not like Oh ain't gonna show you the
back hello this is the bag it all came
in which this is such a cute bag it has
a little K on it if your name starts
with the K that could be really cute but
and it has it like bubbled up on here in
the bag and it's just a nice little
makeup bag that all came in black to
match the collection so that is it for
this video guys I hope you guys enjoyed
it I like the shadows it won't be a
go-to palette for me but it will be a
palette that I'll put to the side and I
want to do a purple look or have
something kind of poppy on my eye look I
will definitely reach for this palette
the lip color the lip colors are cute I
like them again Kylie has come out with
so many lip colors it's unreal so I'm
sure she's tapping into some different
colors uh-huh that is personal
preference on color
I thank you so much for watching this
video and I love you guys to death be
sure if you haven't already and
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
