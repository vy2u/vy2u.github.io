channel today's video I'm going to be
reviewing ok wait first let me first of
all let me say I don't think I've ever
reviewed a Kylie Jenner collection maybe
I have
maybe I reviewed her first question I
don't know I'm reviewing the Kylie Kylie
Kylie Jenner vacation collection on my
channel and I reviewed many glitches I
know I'm a little bit late on it it did
recently sell out obviously it will be
back in stock
very soon as most our products fill out
and then the right bag of songs I'll
rubber look you guys know the drill so I
figured out interview for you guys
anyways I asked you guys on Twitter if
you want to be too and so many of you
were like girl what do you think so I'm
here to review for you guys Kylie did
send this to me and I'm so excited I'm
actually going to Kim Kardashian's isn't
tonight and I get to meet Kim Kardashian
hopefully I'll be able to take a selfie
with her and post it for her contour
sticks that she's launching so if you
guys want to see what the T is on that
be sure and leave a comment down below
and I can review those as well for you
but after right now we will be reviewing
the newest collection from Kylie dinner
and I'm really excited to be reviewing
it something it looks really cool it's
different new products so that's what
I'm excited about it if you haven't
already will then be sure and and we'll
go ahead and jump right into the video
where do I begin okay first let me just
show you the collection she has the wet
set which most people aren't excited
about I believe this product sold out
first
according to Manny and this is the
pressed powder palette so it's
technically a powder palette but this
one was like 62 so the price definitely
went up on this palette there's a nice
mirror in it cardboard packaging and
then these are like you see they're wet
and I've already played with them girl
girl Yoshii Yoshii and the pigmentation
is something from another world like
I've barely touched these and I'm just
going to do a little and look at that
barely touching quick
little swatch by the way Jeffrey Stehr
let me borrow his palette because I did
get it all sent to me but this palette
wasn't in it and I was like I can't do
the review without the main piece Thank
You Jeffrey let me borrow the palette 2
review but I'm excited about this on the
quality difference stepped its game up
and so as the price is big baby
we don't eat things that's not food ok
ok so next let's talk about the
skinny-dip palette this is a safe duo
and as oops cat hair is everywhere now
it has a pretty highlighter which you
can tell I've dug my finger in and I
haven't tried the bronzer it seems to be
very light but we'll see how it performs
hmm then we have take me on vacation
packaging and then it has this is an eye
shadow palette and it has the colors and
the brush looks obviously I haven't
tried it but it looks a bomb I just
watch one of the shimmery eyeshadows
right down there on the bottom and it
was beautiful but I can't wait to see
how these blend out this is definitely
different set up from her other palette
Yoshi here she is a new brand and she's
already pushed it up a little bit and
then we have the matte lipstick and lip
liner in June bug I think that's such a
cute name for this it's a very pop in
purple color very bright and then we
have these two Kylie Jenner glosses one
is very golden it's called glamour and
the glitz it's more champagne E these
looks super cold and then she came out
with three loose pigment highlights I
love loose pigment highlights we have
Tahiti Santorini and Fiji and I love the
nude color on the packaging and then in
gold it says kylie jenner on it then she
sent me the new lippies
I thought she sent me to the same ones
by accident and then Geoffrey's like
girl no one is the velvet Oh liquid
lipstick and then one is the matte
liquid lipstick I didn't really know the
difference but he was explained to me
they are different colors are so similar
I probably wouldn't purchase both of
these if I were a purchaser I would
probably pick one that I liked better
which I'll show you the swatches and
then I would go from there
so first I think we should definitely
start off with the wet set palette and I
will actually start semester off with
this one I'm going to bronze up my skin
and see how this guy perform
and take it more PM 570 brush and get
some of this bronzer it has a little bit
of a gold flicker to it and I have my
foundation and concealer on and I'm just
gonna run up it's very subtle the
bronzer it's not really showing up on my
skintone I think you would have to build
it up a little bit maybe add a little
extra there we go
and it's kind of topi this bronze was
too light for me I think no shade just
keeping it real
I think this run's would be pretty on a
lighter skin tone but like so it gets
kind of gray it looks like hoola light
which doesn't work for me on my cheek
ease so the bronze is too light and
that's okay but if you have a darker
skin tone or any medium skin tone I
would pass on this but just because I
think it would be a bit of a waste of
money so now what I'm excited about is
the wet set because they feel so much
like there's still a putty highlight I'm
going to go in with a little kabuki
brush like I did on those this is a
morphe M 3 3 v brush oh I might a
privacy please
swirl it around and we're about to get
the highlight blowin you could even go
like a with your finger - yeah the
finger works just as well and it's so
blinding and I definitely don't think
you have to have a fancy smancy brush
whoa good lord this palette is so pretty
and blinding blinding honey where is
your sunglasses - that is just pretty I
could just bathe in this like I feel
like if you let me stay here all day
I'll just keep putting it all over my
eyes and I like a mess so let me just
take it down a notch oh my gosh we got
so much eyeliner on I think I went in
too heavy but it's really pretty don't
go crazy like me or I'll just be covered
and it's beautiful so I likey we're
going to start with the vacation palette
now I'm going to use this peachy color
to put all over my lid I'm going to use
the brush that came in the palette I
like the roughy filling bristles I find
it
or so aggressively it blends out the
product and that's what these bristles
are some kind of excited belong I'm
going to take my M 503 brush in this
color they seem to me very pigmented my
brushes are picking up a lot of color
which is a good sign I'm going to use
this kind of as a transition shade the
reason I'm using my own brush because
that bristles on that first in is a
little long and then the other end
they're a little short so I just need
this medium sized brush to get in this
crease really well come on tones come on
Tom I tell you guys will like you smack
me if I don't use this blue cover color
and do another neutral look so guys what
we're going to do blue today my brush
picked up a load of shadow but because I
don't want fallout do you see that
fallout I don't want that on my face I
know my spritz the color says mac fix+
oh that's some pigmentation I'm not
going to lie like these are our iPhones
are good I've never had a issue their
eyeshadows the only one I didn't play
round one is that one that I think got a
little bit of a bad review which was
like a holiday palette I didn't get to
touch that one so I don't know but I may
have been disappointed have any of you
guys like bought this collection well
that's not vivid at all is it oh my love
there you go I'm going to take the other
end of her brush and going with this
chocolatey brown color this is where I
use these like stubby or short brushes
for and I'm just going to lightly woo
and then I'll take the other end and
just soften up that corner right there
so honestly if you're using a lot of
colors and you want tips on getting it
like softly blended out I recommend
having a somewhat clean blending brush
and just think of it as our like your
masterpiece you apply down the color you
press it down and then you want to blend
it out but how are you going to blend it
out with the brush that's caked in the
color you're just going to pull more
color out so you can flip it or you know
get a clean brush and just soften up
those edges to make sure your look is
seamless I just have you know that fresh
brush on hand with a bold look like this
I'm just dying to get some winged liner
on so I'm going to take this old crusty
NYC liquid liner
and I want to apply this and Whang it
out cuz girlfriend when in doubt why are
you gonna wait I know
my winged liner kinda went from zero to
100 but I'm still digging it so that's
an intent swing in cinnamon as I put on
blue bright blue eye shadow and a big
wing on my channel so I hope you guys
are excited about that I'm going to
trial these Lily lashes in Miami but
these are the so extra one so they're
extra big while these lashes are drying
I yeah that's right okay wait that
sounds weird
while these lashes are drying I'm going
to go ahead and test out the loose
powder highlight first
this one's kind of blushy it's very pink
this is Tahiti kind of looks like blush
here it is from far back it kind of
reminds me of orgasm by NARS but would
like way more shimmer in it next we have
a lighter one which is called Santorini
again just very very blinding I heard I
didn't really get to play with her first
at highlights but I heard they were just
very natural so if you're feeling more
of a natural highlight these definitely
aren't for you but girl whew girl if you
like mega blinding these are where it's
at and then we have more of a pinky Shh
undertone champagne a little bit deeper
than that last one this one is Fiji and
I think this one is probably the winner
this is probably my favorite one out of
all of the loose highlight so I go ahead
and try on glitz this is the gloss
okay this is very pretty it kinda comes
off and reminds me of this skinny dip
lip topper by G way I mean just like the
looks and fills of it it looks like
skinny dip buzzy way it's beautiful and
can I would wear this alone definitely I
would wear this would this look right
here like this or I would wear it you
know on top of a little lipstick so it's
versatile and how you can wear it I'm
going to go ahead and try on glamour
glamour is literally I mean it's just
like glitz it just has more of a golden
look to it than champagne E but I think
it's very pretty good if I think back to
the eyes I'm going to take the warmer
brown color and I'm just going to go
ahead and run it from inner to outer
corner and then then take that dark
chocolatey brown color and
just smudge it a lot closer to the lower
lashes I'm going to take one of my dirty
but current favorite mascaras the Dior
this is like their pump one this is a
brand new one I'm going to go ahead and
apply this to connect my real lashes to
my faults ones and then apply to the
lower lashes I don't really think that
this lip would match my eyes I think
it's a lot and a lot together but for
the six of the Videodrome I try it out
for you and show you junebug
junebug actually applied pretty evenly I
don't know you have kind of a hard time
it's a little sparse today but I'm going
to have a really hard time getting these
coach to play easily it wasn't that can
already feel like getting slightly
drying it purpley colors like that are
really hard to make honestly and they
are honestly pretty drying normally so
I'm going to go ahead and swatch the
matte liquid lipsticks in the nude
colors which are everything well I don't
know about the formula but the colors
are everything and just give you the
swatches so you can see so from left to
right we have a naked birthday suit babe
and commando commando these are the
regular liquid lipsticks like the one I
have on right now like jeans ah June Bug
it's just to dry down matte liquid
lipstick and this is the nude set here
are the velvet liquid lipstick and
honestly they feel more stick more
pigmented and more creamy so I'm more
opted to use something like this on my
lip I'm actually going to go ahead and
apply one of these to my lips and go
ahead and take off June bug because June
bug is getting a little bit drying okay
but these velvet ones is the first time
I've ever applied just my lips and
either everything this is one pump one
swipe and look how much pigmentation and
how even it is girl well there you have
it that is the kylie jenner a new
collection i think it is really really
cool collection and i'm pretty excited
about it the only one thing i don't
really recommend that is my review i
love the palette i the purple
little e the velvet lips are everything
the wet sets everything that I shall
pellets everything
I'd like to matte liquid lipsticks the
properly ones a little drawing and
skinny get set was a little crazy and I
endured the glosses slash lip topper
situation I felt they were genius so
yeah I pretty much approve some of the
things most of things in this set we
enjoyed it and I hope it was
informational informational oh it was
informative and you know gave me some
insight on these products and let you
decide what you would want to purchase
oh and in the little blue pigment is
here all day for it okay oh gee I said
what you would purchase from the best
when it comes back in stock and
everybody's fighting for it online but I
love you guys thanks for being here and
watching and I hope to see you all in
the next video
okay Mia stuff girl I'm done got on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
