I'm so happy all you guys are here today
because we are going to be reviewing a
very much so requested review it is the
kylie jenner storm collection we have
two eyeshadow palettes a highlighter
palette and eyeliner three lipsticks and
then a single loose highlighter and then
a gloss like a lip topper gloss so I'm
like did I name everything yes I did
this collection has been like I really
talked about things and a lot of you
guys have requested for me to review it
so of course I'm going to and I'm
filming it it's Monday and I'm gonna try
to have it up this afternoon gonna be a
busy Monday for me okay first thing I
want to say about the collection is I
was actually talking to me about it and
we both agreed like it's exciting to see
this collection and I say that because
there's somewhat of an original idea
like a storm collection I haven't really
personally seen that before and I think
it's just something new and fun there's
been a hundred mermaid and Unicorn
collections no shade and no hate to that
you know every brand does their own
thing and I've seen like 18 million
purple transit highlighters come out
again their shade to that but there has
been a lot of the same thing coming out
recently and that's okay but whenever I
saw the storm collection I was like wow
that is different so okay cool my eyes
are like being something different
also if you have made it through all my
blabbering which you probably see it
through if you didn't hey girl hey I
actually ordered the whole collection
like the big whole collection set for
like 280 bucks I think like the full
thing you guys are like yeah we got it
growing you got the whole thing and I

doing a giveaway in this video so be
sure and subscribe leave one comment
down below this open international and
I'll have the end date and all the
information down below - I've been
watching way too much RuPaul's Drag Race
last week's episode had me okay without
further ado I'm gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE
song
and we're gonna jump right in to the
video subscribe to my channel before you
leave
subscribe alright now let's jump right
into the video
again I've been watching way too much
RuPaul's Drag Race I need a calm down
the first item I really want to talk
about with you guys is the highlighter
palette which it's probably something
that's the most exciting to me I went
ahead and swatch all four shades for you
so it is a palette and it is gray and
cloudy which is super cute on theme with
the collection I think it's interesting
how there's like no text or anything on
the front of the palette it's just like
great clouds like you don't even know
who this palette is made by until you
flip it over with the sticker on the
back so I thought that was interesting
not bad but just different okay where's
the Kylie I'm so you dropped it then you
get the shades in here and I like the
shade range because you have like a
pinky neutral a champagne a really light
one and then like a deeper one so I feel
like with these shades it could work for
majority of skin tones because you have
that deeper one you have that one for
lighter skin and then you have these for
more medium complexion so I'm gonna go
ahead and apply them to my face again I
did swatch them for you guys so you can
kind of see them on my skin tone which I
think I'm more of a medium skin tone so
you can kind of compare and see what
would work for you so I'm gonna take my
all favorite girl you already know the
r-36 this is the rose gold collection
highlighter brush I'm gonna apply the
shade that I think will work best for me
which is this one right here to my face
I'm gonna get some on there all right
here we go do-si-do
it's pretty let's add a little more cuz
you can never have enough yeah see
that's really pretty
does it look chunky at all and honestly
oh my god put too much on my forehead
but honestly um this is what I was most
excited about in the collection do you
guys ever just start applying a little
bit of highlighter and then all of a
sudden you're putting on your chin and
cheeks in your forehead and your eyelids
and everywhere you're so what am i what
am i doing like why am I putting this
all over my face highlighter is so
effective okay look at Lu my forehead
I'm gonna take the lightest one and mix
it with the one I just use
put it on the tip of my nose this makes
my whole soul and life happy putting
highlight of my nose I'm like that's how
it makes me feel it sighs yes okay let's
move into the eyeshadow palettes and
talk about them a little bit of two
palettes in this collection and this is
the calm before the storm and this one
is the eye of the storm so one is
supposed to be more calming once with
some more like the packaging I really
like this one with the lightening this
one with the suavi marble situation I
think it's the yeah it's a little weird
I don't hate it but this one's really
cute with the Lightning coming down and
it's like great like a cloud I like that
first let's talk about the calm before
the storm I don't hate the color seem in
this palette I get where she's going
like it's it's you know like soft and
light and it looks like a Easter Egg
this palette though reminds me of Easter
this should be like a spring Easter
palette but anyways the colors aren't
bad into me and I like how she did the
match the mattes to match the shimmers
but in my opinion it might be a little
bit difficult for you to get a complete
look at this palette because of the
colors but you can always get creative
and there are no rules in makeup so you
could totally get a full look out of it
but just for like an everyday palette I
just don't think this would be my one I
will say this is my least favorite out
of the two palettes have the eye of the
storm is really pretty I like the color
scheme a lot I like that you can use
like this purple for a transition shade
your brow bone you know to soften up
your eye should a primer deepen up the
corner things like that and that's what
I do like about this palette and I think
the colors are really pretty
watching the colors and how they felt I
felt like they some shimmers had like
more pigment than others some of the
foils were like incredibly pigmented and
then some of the shimmers were like okay
pigmented but overall the quality of the
color palettes have been pretty good so
far
let's go ahead and do an eye look with
the palettes I'm gonna go ahead and tap
into this shade and I like shades like
this because you guys know I put down a
lot of eyeshadow primer and I feel like
this just softens it up and makes it so
much easier to blend out the rest of
your shadows and kind of like set your
face
I'm gonna take our 39 and grab them the
calm before the storm this little yellow
mat also there's no mirror in these
pallets and I love when there's a mirror
in the pallet and she has been putting
them in there in the past so I don't
know why these don't - this color it is
really not that pigment it when I'm
blending it out like you can't even like
see it I don't know why I thought it
would be like a bright orange yellow but
like this one I'm not loving yeah
it's like where's the pigment in this
color okay next I'll grab this shade
right here by the way I'm using our 39
brush and I'm just gonna pop that right
up in this upper crease area
again like this gray color it comes off
pretty dark in the palette but it blends
out so light I feel like as far as the
mattes so far they haven't had quite as
much pigment as they have in her past
palette I don't I haven't no idea why
but I know this is how I'm feeling I
have only used two colors so we'll see
what happens I really want to put this
bright yellow all over my eyelid but the
mattes have been scaring me so Oh see
that's building up so nicely it's like
actually has a lot of pigment that she
yellow shade I don't know why I want a
bright yellow eyeshadow lid I swear I
don't think I've ever in the history of
YouTube had had a bright yellow I should
have a lid so I'm like this is this is
our opportunity people we got to do this
girl I'm just gonna attacked by a cat in
the middle of do my makeup but that is
something than normal that happens in my
household you know it's gonna go back
into that gray color we were using and
just soften up the edges I'm gonna this
happen to this darker brown I'm just
gonna take this little pencil brush this
is a 8:36 and I'm going to kind of work
it in that crease I'm kind of follow the
shape of my eyelid around with it I'm
gonna take the lightest shade and pop it
into my inner corners and brow bone I
take some of this Stila
eyeliner I would use hers but is yellow
and I just did a yellow eye look without
thinking that through I'm gonna go ahead
and apply this and just add a wing I'm
gonna take some of the darker Brown and
blend it on the lower lash line this is
a morphe M 408 and then it's happened
some of that lighter gray shade and I'm
just gonna blend it just soften up that
lower lash line so that I look it's
complete I popped on some Miami Lily
lashes cuz you guys know their mouth
fight and then she also came out with
this powder highlight it is like yellow
and glitter and when i swatched it i
really didn't like it because i felt
like it was really chalky looking with
hunks of glitter in it so I actually
don't recommend the loose highlight to
you but her the ones in the past seem to
be a little bit better but that one I'm
just like no yes I came out with three
lipsticks she came out with a brown nude
a really nude nude and a buck
I love the nude shades in the block it's
super freakin pigmented so I say we
drown the black shade first I mean like
that's in saying this is probably one of
the most pigmented black lipsticks I've
ever put on my life will I ever wear
this No
next up is the nude Nova I think that
this one's probably my favorite and the
one that's gonna go with our look today
the most Nova is absolutely stunning
this is I'm a nude girl you guys already
know so I'm gonna put a little bit of
cosmic on the outer corners but they're
both really pretty the nudes with the
black I'm like whoa pigment but go you
know I just don't wear black lipstick
okay and then lastly is the eyeliner I
did get to try it out on the pot it's
just like the color pop eyeliner so if
it's anything like those I do like those
minors they do work pretty well so but I
think it try it out with a yellow on
yellow girl like a bumble bee today I
don't know I was thinking about like
storm like gray and yellow and then it
came out looking like a bee that is it
for this video guys I reviewed the
collection that I shadow palettes
honestly the mat just weren't as
pigmented as I was hoping they would be
in like as they have been in the past
except for the yellow it was really
pigmented the shimmers are here and
there I definitely like this palette
better than this palette but they're
both pretty good palette my highlighter
I don't recommend
the lipsticks are nice oh the lip topper
this is where we get into that
iridescent glitter and there's nothing
wrong with that so chunky grainy and
glittery and you can like kind of feel
the roughness slightly to it I just
don't wear anything like that intent on
my lips um but overall like is a pretty
lip topper and it does go with the
collection so if you do like like a
purple pink era descent on your lips
you'll probably like this but I don't
know for me I'm just like I'm not here
for that
i swatched it for you say you guys can
tell for yourself if you would like it
but it's just a simple lip topper gloss
and it didn't seem too goopy it's the
review of the collection guys I hope you
enjoyed it I hope it gave you insight on
this collection I did like majority of
it but then there were some pieces that
were a little floppy for me and but I
hope you guys enjoyed the video be sure
and give it a thumbs up don't forget to
enter the giveaway and I'll see all of
my little sweet Laura Lee's oh just eat
your noodles please in my next video
