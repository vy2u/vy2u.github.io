video is going to be a little bit
different maker tutorial for me I saw
this picture of Kendall Jenner on
Pinterest and I was like oh my gosh I
have to recreate that look running I
love it I think it's absolutely perfect
for spring it is so strobe a just so
fresh clean and glowing skin in this
tutorial the main attraction is going to
be the face not the eyes this takes us
two seconds pretty much to do our eye
makeup today with the face is what we're
really gonna be working on today just
getting that fresh glowy skin - my
friend here we're going to name him
Frederick let's name him Fred I'm also
going to be using in two days oh it's
got fingerprints all over and then I
clean that off row I'm going to be using
a brand new palette by Pierre that
hasn't even launched yet it launches on
the 30th of this month so Marc calendars
because it's their new strobing palette
I used all three colors in this palette
for this tutorial today and this is our
sunkissed glow and they have a moon glow
palette as well but today I'm going to
be using the sunkissed glow one so
freaking gorgeous the bronzer the blush
and the highlights just a strobing
palette and we use it all over the place
today I'm going to show you how to put
it into good use be sure to subscribe to
my channel before you leave for more
tutorials more talking videos more
random stuff that I'll be putting up on
this channel I jump ready to get started
and I hope by starting out I've already
primed my skin with my Marc Jacobs this
is invisible undercover primer and it is
really great driving hydrating the skin
my skin is somewhat dry at this point
however this part of my face it's not
behaving very nice next I'm going to go
in with a little bit of primer water
from Smashbox just to help prime the
skin a little bit more I mostly use that
marjenka primer just to add moisture to
my skin I'm going to be going in with
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
I'm in shade Y 365 mine has my name
engraved on it I'm not using just a wet
Beauty Blender to blend all of this out
my skin is kind of dry like I said
before so actually using a wet
be blender I warned this like this last
year that it helps retain moisture into
the skin by pressing a wet Beauty
Blender and we're also doing for a very
dewy strobed outlook so this is going to
help with that too if you have extremely
oily skin a wet Beauty Blender may not
be a good thing to use all the time you
might we just want to stick with like a
kabuki brush blending out your product
now that I have a foundation on them be
going in with my NYX ultra HD concealer
and I'm just going to apply this to the
under eye those dirtbags are lingering
I'm gonna just go ahead and highlight my
face
except I'm going to go in with a little
bit of setting powder by Laura Mercier
and I'm just going to set everything it
helps to lock and load it and that way
it doesn't crease up and get all crazy I
thought I like I've been baking cookies
all day I'm going to let this set here
for like five minutes maybe less and
then I'll just dust it all away next I'm
going to take this morphe 57 brush and a
little bit of this round contour color
from make it forever and we're actually
going to do a bit of cream contouring
anytime I do any type of Jenner or
Kardashian makeup I tend to cream
contour a little bit I'm going to take
this f77 chiseled contour brush and kind
of move the cream product around a bit
and then I'll blend it out with my
Beauty Blender
and dampen my beauty blender to make
everything more blendable a little bit
of mac fix+
now that that's wounded all out were to
go in for the main attraction which this
is the sunkissed glow palette feeling it
with the bronze II shade right here
which is just a beautiful shimmery brown
color it's really gonna bronze up our
skin I'm just gonna dab it with my
Beauty Blender and we're just gonna
intensify that contour and give us a
little bit more of a bronze kiss
sunkissed look I love the way bronze
skin looks it's just so pretty
especially right there on the temples
where the sunlight naturally hits your
face it just looks like a very beautiful
natural bronze tub look next up I'm
going to continue to use this palette
I'm gonna go in with this beautiful like
I want to call it rose gold it's like a
peach with a little bit of a champagne
color within him and I take the butt of
the beauty blender and just kind of
buh-buh-buh and I actually use that as
kind of like our blush what I'm actually
gonna do is go in with a smidge of Max
Bronte cheek with this cheeky bronze I'm
just making up names and I mean just a
smidge and kind of set that cheek color
okay lastly my favorite part is going in
with this shade right here which is just
an absolutely gorgeous highlight shade I
might take my finger and you know we
bought the highlight that nose up
cheekbones are like the main event here
a little bit more and get that cupids
bow really well I'm also going to grab a
little bit and hit the temples with it
this is just a strobing method and it's
really pretty you can also just go ahead
and drag it up around now we're gonna
move on to the eyes I'm gonna take a
smidge of this little light taupey brown
color called cork by Mac I'm gonna pop
it just right there in the crease and
blend it all over really but keeping it
kind of low into the crease I just hate
crimper from colour-pop and with my
finger I'm
going to apply this right to the lid by
pressing it on such a gorgeous comma
I'll take a bit of this highlighting
shade from the stroke palette and apply
it to the inner corners like that tear
duct area and then I'm going to go in
with a little bit of nylon by Mac which
is one of my favorite colors I've had
this color for ever in a day because it
only takes a dot at the color it goes
such a long way and we're just gonna
apply that right on top to set that a
stroke color I'll also go ahead and
apply a little bit of this nylon to the
brow bone highlight numrows next I'll
take this liner pencil and I'm just
gonna fill in the waterline with a nude
color it's gonna open up the eyes who
looks so weird when I do this anche feel
like who's made myself look really
sleepy because I don't have any mascara
on yet because wait it gets better
something that I've recently learned to
do just because my lashes are so dark
and when I put such a light color and
try to put lashes fake lashes on top of
my real ones you can see like in between
where they don't meet so I've been
putting like this very thin strip a
liner across the lower lash line every
time I don't wear a winged liner we're
not going to be wearing I have an itch
I'm not picking minute but we're not
going to be wearing winged liner today
so I'm going to do just a very thin
strip and it helps to define the eyes a
little bit too
except I'm going with my fully charged
mascara and I'm going to apply this to
the lashes because where else would I
apply mascara slope and I say things
like I'm going to apply mascara to the
lashes now well of course you are Laura
of course you are
I'm going to apply these very wispy
lashes called rook well by huda beauty
I'm going to apply these to see here I
go again
what apply these to my upper lash line
we're also you can apply them to your
nose her Kendal's lips are so faintly
colored really they're not in color it
looks like she just has I'm looking down
at a picture over it looks like she just
has a sheer gloss on I have a seed robe
I drew a cosmetics which pretty much
just looks identical to what she has on
it was like she has a smidge of color
underneath so something weird I'm going
to do is take this cream blush from
Smashbox it's called silver like sunset
I'm just going to apply this to my lips
mm-hmm we get weird up in here and then
I'm gonna apply a seed row by G way on
top I'm go out sick instead of flossing
I'm just gonna take a little bit more as
it's just color and just make sure it's
just over the top
the last step is to spritz your face
with a little bit of Mac fux
