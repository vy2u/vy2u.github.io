video is going to be like this Kim K it
is a very clean clean makeup look it is
so light on the eyes the main focus in
this tutorial is going to be face makeup
not the eyes eyes which is so simple
love the way it came out a really cool
thing about this tutorial some of the
products that I chose to use in the
tutorial is could read a really big nice
blog on Mario Badescu s masterclass that
he like open to the public and somebody
went and they wrote a blog post on all
the products that he liked to use on Kim
and actually have a lot of the products
so I use them incorporate it in this
tutorial so it's like Calif I'd make up
because her makeups always awful I was
really excited to be able to create a
Kim K tutorial actually using the
products that her makeup artist of Mario
uses it lots of questions on my nails
this is so random by the way but they
are the naturally Nicole nails by nail
her I'll have them linked down below as
well as a discount code if you're
interested we're going to jump right in
warm 8 started we are going to simplify
our eyes and complicate our facial
makeup okay that's all I have to tell
you guys we're in jeopardy and get
started
hope your excited hope you like the
video if you do give it thumbs up
starting off this tutorial we're going
to prime our skin as usual this is my
morning voice by the way guys that
sounded like a moon I'm going in with
the Marc Jacobs new primer just got this
in the mail and I've been adoring it it
is super hydrating to the skin then I'm
going to go in with my Mac Studio Fix
foundation in NC 35 I'm going to dupe
this all over my face as I always do in
every video then I'm going to blend it
out with the contour sponge the sponge
is dampened of course these sponges are
pretty much useless whenever they aren't
dampened because they just drawing up
your product and it's just a big waste
so it's been lots of time dabbing that
all over my face for a flawless finish
next I'll go in and we're gonna go ahead
and conceal the face I'm going to use my
Mac Pro Longwear concealer in NC 30 I'm
going to take this little concealer
brush from Sigma which is my favorite to
apply the concealer because you can just
get it so accurately applied to your
face in the right areas I'm going to
apply it under the eyes down the nose
the forehead to keep its bow and a dab
on the chin and when I blend that out
with the contour sponge again I love how
it presses it into the skin you know
what I have found that whenever by skin
wants to be Olli that sponges don't work
for me because they retain moisture into
your skin crews pushing so much water
into your skin but whenever it's the
winter time and heaters are on it's
drawing out your skin I feel like I go
back to my sponges because they actually
add moisture into my skin that's just me
and just spilling a little juice for ya
and I'm just going to blend this out in
a dabbing motion that way we don't move
around the product too much then I go in
with my favorite Laura Mercier
translucent powder to set everything I
like this product so much because I can
trust it to never flash back on me
whenever I'm using a flash and I can
also trust it to set everything to
perfection and this big jar will last me
for six months and
using it everyday so I don't mind
spending the money on it then I'm going
to go in with the Bobby Brown Foundation
stick in warm almond to contour my face
I start at the top of the ear and drag
it down about halfway I'm going to do
the nose the temples and drag just a
touch around the forehead area I'll also
do a little bit around my chin just to
give me that nice rounded chin look Kim
K's makeup artist actually uses this as
her whole entire foundation not just to
contour with but I'm going to be
contouring my whole face with it as you
see here not as my foundation I don't
like the stick as my foundation I feel
like it's just a wee bit heavy for me
I'm going to blend this out with the
contour sponge using that little cut
edge there you can use a brush if you
want to at this point use whatever you
have on hand you don't have to do the
same thing as me but I love blending
this out with the contours punch as you
can see this foundation stick does blend
out quite easily so I'm actually going
to add a little bit of a powder on top
of the contour because it ends up
blending out so light it's not quite I
don't know it's not deep enough of a
contour for me in a camp K look go back
in with a powder you'll see in just a
second now I never do this punch on my
nose because I feel like it moves the
product around way too much I just take
a little blending brush and I just swipe
up and and I blend it down the nose now
this is the part where I'm going to go
in with a bronzers and Mario actually
uses hoola it's like his favorite
contour bronzer for Kim I was kind of
surprised it wasn't something like super
super high in but it's just hoola
I love hoola by benefit is a great matte
bronzer I'm just going to take this
brush and blend it right on top of where
we put the cream contour it also sets
that contour but it's going to deepen it
up a little bit and make it a little bit
more dramatic which is going to look
really pretty for this look because
remember we're just doing a super light
eye now always do this with my Laura
Mercier translucent powder because this
sharpens up that contour and gives you
that nice clean edge because I did get a
little bit messy with the powder so this
is just going to fix everything you do
have to let it set there for a while to
cook into your skin or bake cook bake
whatever you want to call it I'm going
to go in with mocha this is a beautiful
pinky peach this is not pinky peach this
is a beautiful Bobbie pink blush by Mac
that I think would look absolutely
gorgeous on any
skintone now this is Mario's favorite
highlighter to use on Kim this is the
what's up by benefit I'm going to take
this new little highlighter brush from
Sigma I'm going to blend it out I did
put it on the upper points of the
cheekbones the nose and I'm just going
to swipe back and forth to make sure it
looks really soft instead of like a
harsh chunk of highlighter on my cheek I
also take a DAB and sprinkle it on my
temple so I'm going to go in with the
betty-lou
now this is the mary lou manizer by the
balm and i'm going to pop a little bit
of this on top and I do drag this a
little bit on the temples like right
there do you see I just did like a dash
that way my skin doesn't look old it it
looks luminous Doupe Doupe Doupe and it
turns out some creamy now I'm going to
do the eye brows Kim kate has natural
brows like if you look at a picture
close-up is actually her brow hairs I am
lacking brow hair because I got a hold
of tweezers back whenever I was in high
school and it just went all downhill
from there so my brows are going to be a
little bit less natural because
obviously they're going to be drawn in
instead of my real hairs Mario does use
the brow wiz I'm using here but all he
has to do is fill in the sparse areas I
have to actually draw on eyebrows mwah I
have a full brow tutorial if you want to
see how I do that
so basically what I'm saying here is my
brows look nothing like Kim's and I'm
just going to roll with it I'm going to
go in with my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre I'm going to carve out the brows
just to make it look nice and clean and
then I'm going to drag it down and use
it as my eye primer I do this every
single day of the week I'm going to go
ahead and dust a way that Laura Mercier
translucent powder because I think it
has set there long enough and give us
that nice clean sharp edge for a contour
and it looks so pretty look at that yeah
honey this is the most underrated
palette than more pieces this is a 35 T
I'm going to go in with this little
knobby brown color
I don't know why this palette isn't
hyped up like the 35o but it absolutely
should be it is gorgeous in color and
you'll see that in this tutorial so I'm
taking this little knobby color in an e
40 brush and I'm just willing to get all
in the crease not being precise
whatsoever just love
I don't know I always sing to stop so
annoying now I'm going to go in with
this golden color right here and I grab
a flat shader brush and I'm gonna pop
that on to the lid that's pretty much
the extent of our eyes today I'm also
going to take a little bit and pop it in
the inner corner of the eyes to open the
eyes in the brow bone so again the lid
the inner corner and the brow ball and
easy peasy lemon squeezy we're not going
to do any eyeliner because we want to
keep the eyes super light I'm then going
to go in with that taupey color we used
it first I'm just going to blend that
right across the lower lash line and pop
a little bit of the gold color all the
way across the lower lashes because it
looks like Kim had a little bit of a
sparkle I'm gonna curl the lashes just
so that kind of go with my falsies and
I'm gonna pop on the Hypnose drama
mascara by Lam come this mascara I have
been loving and I just discovered it it
was sent to me
I found it mascara drawer and I was like
hmm what's his fill and I tried it and I
loved it it is so it just does not clump
your lashes but it builds volume and
that's hard to find so I'm going to pop
that on the upper and lower lashes if
you don't do false lashes simply leave
it at that and I'm sure your look will
be absolutely stunning but for me I'm a
falsies girl so I'm going to go in with
lash arete bias Kito lashes I'm gonna
pop these in as close to my real lashes
as I can for a more natural effect they
are so feathery I love these lashes then
I'm gonna do the lips first I'm going to
line my lips my favorite lip liner this
is stripped down by Mac it's just a
really light nude color and then I'm
gonna go in with pure Hollywood that is
a liquid lipstick goodbye honest Oscar
Beverly Hills can you hurry up so you
can see the liquid lipstick there it is
it is Saul Perini I'm gonna do this all
over my lips and then I will go in it
back with the line
and I will line right on top of this
just to define the lips a little bit
more that way they're not all one nude
color I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial this is pretty much it I love
