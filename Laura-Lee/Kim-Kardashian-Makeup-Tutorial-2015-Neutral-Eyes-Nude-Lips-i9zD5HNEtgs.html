hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a Kim Kardashian
makeup tutorial she posted a picture
last night on Instagram of her outfit
and her makeup she did a really big
close-up of her makeup and her actual
makeup artist makeup by Mario on
Instagram post hit the same picture and
he listed the products that he used on
her down below and I was like hello that
makes it so easy to do a tutorial I
didn't even have all the products but it
was really easy because I was able to
look up the products and then find
products that look just like them it is
a beautiful look it's very natural
it's lashes new lips and that's
basically it
the main focus here is her face makeup
Kim Kardashian always has really heavy
facial makeup you can tell in the
picture she is a lot going on in her
face and let say that comes from
paparazzi lifestyle meat you're gonna be
taking a lot of pictures up she did go
to an event and stuff you're gonna want
to have heavy face makeup that way the
camera doesn't wash out everything that
you have on your face um so we do do
really heavy face makeup in this
tutorial but the eyes and lips are just
like wham bam and done I just wanted to
say before we get this um video started
that I don't really look like Kim
Kardashian my face is not shaped like
hers my nose it's not like hers and we
all know my eyebrows are know like hers
okay they fill them in a little bit
thicker but basically the whole point in
this video is the makeup and I want to
make it look like hers and I think yeah
it came out really well actually I
really am pleased with the outcome
especially because I had the list of all
the products that were used it was just
like Hello I knew with his corneal hang
around if you want to learn how to
create this look
okay so I get my hair my face and to get
started we use my Mac natural radiant
and this is gonna add moisture oh I just
feel so good I'm gonna go in and add
some primer on top of that once that
dries we're gonna go in now with the
master prime by Maybelline I am finished
it is awesome
so just going to like add that to these
areas where my pores would be loud and
proud need it calm what is this piece of
your doing I can't get it to stop
because Kim K is a few shades darker
than me I'm actually just going to use
this support an hour we're a perfection
foundation I'm in color medium third and
thirty-one almond and this foundation is
full coverage and it's also it's just
amazing like I love this stuff I don't
know why it's not more popular than what
it is probably cuz its Sephora brand and
that brand never gets too crazy popular
with anything but it's a good foundation
it's heavy but it's good now we're just
going to beat a blended that out
it look like you just got back from a
tropical vacation per hour eyebrows are
filled in with the brow with and dark
brown so that's actually what I have
here so we're just going to fill in
these brows with the exact same color as
Kim
so I look good and scary because I just
have my eyebrows filled in for mega
party she's mocked by lorac and
disrespect Anastasio Beverly Hills I
don't have either those colors but I can
tell you what the exact same
duplicate of those are is nooner and
limit by Urban Decay this is the Naked 3
palette three common colors - they're
just knobby pink colors so first I'm
going to go in with neuter and I'm just
going to blend that in the crease
serious business here her eyes were just
so not on going on there's really light
neutral a Kim Ki so I'm going to take
that from outer corner all the way to
the inner corner talent
and now I'm going to go in with limit
which is the lighter color and I'm just
going to buff that on top
it looks like she has like the smallest
bit of a darker eyeliner color on her
lower lash line like smudged out I'm
just gonna add a little bit liner to the
top of my lid just gonna use this
L'Oreal smoldering and so
little smudgy brush from morphe just
going to soften that line up
go ahead and add a little bit of mascara
to my upper lashes only make Marcia's
L'Oreal voluminous mascara which really
I'm not a big fan of this stuff but when
recreating her I'm gonna use this add a
little bit of Milani on top of that just
so we can have some actual volume going
on to her manga artist said he used
individual lashes so what I'm gonna do
is take my arty on natural lashes and
I'm going to trim them and I'm just
going to place them in different areas
these little Naturals and some demi
wispies like use a little bit of each
you
we're going to focus on the lower
lashline later but right now I'm going
to go in with my Mac in c30 Pro
concealer and I'm just going to
highlight my face we're going to apply a
little under the eye on the nose Cupid's
bow
we're gonna do the forehead dupe for our
Beauty Blender go now we're going to
blend all this out on our face
I contour my face I'm going to take my
favorite contouring palette right now
you guys this Mehran pro palette so I've
been liking this color right here maybe
a little bit of that color I just mix
all the colors really we're gonna go
ahead and carve out our cheeks if you
don't have this palette I just did a
full video on how to creme highlighting
contour using only drugstore products so
and I break it down for you like how I
do each step and why I do it so
definitely check that video out if
you're really interested in cream
contouring and highlighting your face on
a budget first you just want to know
more information about it check that
video out I'll link it down below for
you guys now going in with this 3d
angled kabuki brush guys if you're gonna
cream contour and highlight I recommend
eventually whenever you get a chance
getting this brush I also have this link
down below because this is so awesome
for blending it out the most important
part in cream hunt contouring and
highlighting is the blending out process
I'm actually just going to dab a little
bit of this light color here and I'm
just going to apply it right here this
is just going to enhance that jaw
contour time to set everything I'm gonna
go in with this f-35s from Sigma this is
my favorite highlight and setting powder
brush it is amazing I bought this brush
by itself at incoming a kid has a chip
in it um and my Laura Mercer setting
powder which has just been a favorite of
mine let me rule with you um Patrick
Starr uses this on his clients and said
that's why I asked me to buy it because
I'm definitely trust whatever he says
because he knows a lot and um I'm
obsessed with it I can't quit using it
now we're going to intensify the contour
a little bit more and I know you guys
are like what but I'm telling you like
if you look at the picture of her if
she's bronzed so we need to warm up the
skin just a little bit more I'm just
gonna add a bronzing powder on top of
this we're just gonna go in with the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and we're
just gonna do a little bit more
contouring
the outside city used a blush and doll
line I looked it up I've never really
heard of the blush so excuse me for that
but I'm gonna pull out a very similar
color blush and we're just gonna add
that instead go in with NYX amber blush
which is a matte blush and this is a new
one from their spring 2015 line Oh their
blushes are so marvelous going in with a
super duper duper light hand I'm just
gonna pop a little bit on to the apples
of my cheeks she has her waterline
filled in with a creamy pencil like this
I'm gonna go in with the inner rim liner
by Tarte and get that a really good
fill-in honestly just looks like she has
um mascara on her lower lash lines I'm
just gonna go in with that Milani
mascara my lashes story of my life I am
adding some bottom lashes just because I
don't have it many they're just gonna
step up the lower lash game you're
seeing like a lot of messy white this is
just lash glue and it's gonna dry clear
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
nylon by Mac which is this the most
shimmery beautiful light color in the
world I'm gonna plug that in the inner
corner because her inner corner is just
like glowing so we need a little shimmer
now we're north on Kim K's loose lips
the really cool thing about this
tutorial is her makeup artist she's pure
Hollywood and actually have that color
by Anastasia Beverly Hills for liquid
lips but she does have something brown
underneath so I'm going to go ahead and
do court and cork and I apply a little
bit of that underneath and then put pure
Hollywood on top just because there's no
way I believe she just used this like
there's so much Bobby Brown going on and
then this is like that's not what that
is just literally going to add a small
amount of quark
