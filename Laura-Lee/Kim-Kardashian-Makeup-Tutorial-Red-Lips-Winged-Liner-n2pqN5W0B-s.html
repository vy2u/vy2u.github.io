chit chat to a minimum on this video
we're going to jump right in I'm going
to start by priming my face with this
radiant primer this time of year my skin
is a little dry and I'm using this
primer because it adds moisture to the
skin then going in with my Sephora
10 hour wear foundation I'm using this
because the shades a bit darker and I'm
going for a Kim K look obviously on this
video and I'm just pushing that into my
skin with my Beauty Blender I already
have my eyebrows filled in so I'm going
to go in with this paint pot by Mac this
is painterly and I'm going to use this
as a primer base for my eyeshadow but I
also clean up my eyebrows with this
stuff it's kind of like a two-in-one
then I'm going to highlight Kim K always
has a super heavy highlight first I'm
going in with NARS just to cover up any
darkness under the eyes and brighten up
the underneath area and then I go in
with my Mac boost pin and I'm going to
highlight the rest of my face with it
this pin blends out so easily guys next
I'm going to spray my Beauty Blender
with a little bit of mac's fix+ and this
is going to help lock in that concealer
when doing a highlight this heavy you
really want to be sure and take your
time and make sure that everything is
very seamless you don't want to ever
start seeing where your concealer starts
and your foundation stops you just want
it to be a really soft radiant look then
using the famous Ben Nye banana powder
to set my concealer that way it lasts
longer it brightens up the highlight and
it helps it from creasing
next going in with my malli bronzer this
is a little highlight kit I'm going to
buffer this into my cheekbone jaw area
and round circular motions really
pushing this and blending it into the
skin and then I'm going to bring it up
around my temples and forehead area the
lips are the main attraction on this
look so for eyes we're just going to go
in with the unzip palette by the rock
popping on a little bit of this light
color just from the lid all the way up
to the brow bone and then I'm going to
go in with a little bit of a darker
matte color and I'm going to blend that
in the crease just to give a tiny bit of
definition to our eyes but that's
basically yet because the lips are our
focus just add a little bit more drama
we're going to go ahead and wing it out
and I do go in and create a pretty thick
black winged liner here whenever
creating big black winged liner you want
to start off really thin and then build
it up then I'm going to take a darker
brown color and smudge that right around
my lower lash line and then I'm going to
go in with a golden color and I'm going
to blend that out right below that
darker brown color I'm going to fill in
my waterline with a nude color this is
really going to help us open up the eyes
and make them pop then I'm going to go
in and add a little bit of mascara to
the upper and lower lashes this is its
tight line mascara and it helps get in
there with the little bitty bottom
lashes and I'm actually going to add
bottom lashes because Kim K always has
so much dramatic lashes ever
they're so beautiful so I'm adding
precious by house of lashes on the
bottom and then I'm going to add iconic
Bahasa lashes on the top which these are
really just dramatic fun lashes and just
super glamorous add lots of drama to our
look
then I'm going to be lining my lips with
cherry by Mac and this just a really
bold lip liner color for our red and
then I'm going in with my favorite
fire-engine by Gerard cosmetics this is
a really nice blue tone matted a red
color and it really makes your teeth
look really wide so that's super cool
about this color
but I have a discount code for it down
below if you're interested and this is
our final look thank you guys so much

this video it really means a lot
give it a thumbs up and leave me a cool
comment down below I would love to chat
with you guys and I will see you all in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
