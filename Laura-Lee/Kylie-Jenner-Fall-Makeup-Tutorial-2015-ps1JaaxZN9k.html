hairstylist to hook a girl up your
followers won't forgive you
hey guys look at my channel today's
video is super special because I have a
guest with me here today this is Senecas
bargain with Hyuna
I love her channel she has a YouTube
channel by the way and she has an
amazing website where she posts all
kinds of information on beauty travel
home everything you could think of I do
it all she's gonna be doing my makeup in
this video so super cool Sarah is a
makeup artist yeah we wanted to do this
Kylie Jenner look on her cuz we both saw
this film picture on her Instagram and
we're like wow this is so pretty we have
this makeup tutorial on her channel we
have the power of makeup on my channel
and then and then the giveaway the gooey
ways we have two huge galleries and
awesome prizes you guys are excited
we're gonna jump right in and get
started with this tutorial and don't
forget to check out our video on sona
channel as well
you can start with priming her face and
she already has moisturizer on right yep
Moisture right so we're gonna go in with
the Too Faced hangover primer because
this is actually really hydrating so I
love using this kind of like moisturizer
and primer and it's super good now that
the hair is done I'm gonna go in with
her foundation and this is the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation in sand
her skin is just gorgeous thank ya so
jealous I got it from parent
we're going to apply some concealer and
this is the NARS irradiance ealer and
creamy and we are Gossard I'm just gonna
get in here right all over and just a
little bit on top of her nose around
this area so basically the center of
your skin we're just gonna use my Beauty
Blender to blend this in place because I
feel like it does a really good job
blending it so I'm gonna go in with the
translucent powder and set everything in
place and this is the Make Up For Ever
HD powder this one's great because I
feel like it works well if you have
pores too it kind of minimizes the pores
highlighting and contouring so I'm going
to use a couple of different things but
the first one is my benefit and the
stuff is so cool it's called what's up
mm-hmm I love that yeah apply a little
bit on the high points of your cheeks I
always feel like the cream ones lasts
way longer than the powder ones - well I
feel like with Kylie they do a lot of
highlighting and contouring so I'm gonna
do both and I want this to kind of be
the base of it so we're gonna go ahead
and blend the cream highlighter in place
I recently made a palette with NARS I
know I was so excited it fit beautiful
go ahead and use a highlighter this one
right over here it's a really really
pretty color and I just want to lightly
dust this
so next we're gonna do the same thing
use the hoola bronzer we're gonna go
ahead and carve out those cheekbones
best way to contour is to start from the
top of your ear and kind of work your
way down that's gonna be the best
application for your face
do you want to go ahead and apply a
little bit of the bronzer on the jaw
line you want to just touch the bone a
little bit and kind of shave it down a
little bit on the forehead give that
beautiful bronzy look just gonna go
ahead and punch with the side blush
we're gonna go in with something
peachy's when it's called style by Mac
I've never heard of that really it was
one of my favorites as you can see just
smile and pop it on the apples of the
cheeks then kind of work your way up so
just so you know I'm using a palette
here this one's the Ardell palette and
I'm just using this color and a little
bit of the brown
go in with this product from Mac this
one is called girl boy and just lighten
her brows just a little bit well for the
eyes we're gonna go ahead and use mainly
these two shadows right over here and
maybe even a little bit of this light
champagne color cuz Kylie's eyes look
really bronzy and kind of glowing let me
use the same highlighter we used on the
face and actually carve out the brow
bone using a flat brush you want more
intensity you can spray a little bit of
fix+
on your brush and it'll make the shadow
a lot more intense and it go ahead and
do that for the inner corners with the
champagne color and we're gonna dust
this all over the eyelid
this one is actually I believe this is
Anasazi Beverly Hills yes this one's
called fawn on the crease with a fluffy
brush and you want to apply and blend at
the same time so that's why it's good to
use a fluffy brush like this one I'm
gonna go in with just a little bit of a
dark brown shadow and this one is by
NARS again and this one's called Coconut
Grove
it really carves out the crease with
just a little bit of darkness the same
with brown color and apply it on the
bottom lashline and really really close
to the lash line same thing on the top
lashline you want to apply it really
really close to the lash line and kind
of fade it out next we're gonna use that
same brown liner and this time a tight
brush like this one and close your eyes
we're gonna get this shadow in between
her lashes just creating the illusion of
fuller lashes I'm gonna go ahead and
apply just a little bit so that there's
some definition you just want to lift
the eye with you oh wow we're gonna go
ahead and apply these lashes they're a
little bit closer to what she has on
these are by house of lashes as well and
these are called a bombshell
closing the eyes just so much easier to
work with so I have my models close
their eye and then I just go in there
and get it really really close to the
lash line I'm gonna go back in with a
brown shadow and again with a pencil
brush
now that the lashes are on we're gonna
go ahead and apply a little bit of this
again on the actual lash line because
it's just gonna make the lashes look
fuller and the look is just gonna look
very rich although it's not really a
smoky eye we're kind of smoking that out
just a little bit we're a new bottom
lash mascara and
we're gonna be done with the eyes
ellipse she actually has this really
cool brown lipstick on which i think is
part of her line and I think that's
coming out but since we don't have that
we're gonna cheat a little bit with a
brown eyeliner and actually apply this
on the lips because we don't have to
look color that Kylie has there's gonna
be two winners all the rules will be in
