in
I kind of feel like I look like Michael
Jackson no yes
hey guys welcome to my channel so this
is not my normal makeup tutorial hello
weird thing okay so I was that I got lip
monthly and it's a prescription
subscription of a prescription for a
poor lip products every month this is
the April 2015 one I was gonna share
this bag and tell you about it in
another video but strange thing happened
so when I got it obviously busted it
open and then this lip liquid lipstick
from Oprah came out of it and I
literally looked at it and I said Kylie
Jenner who reminded me so much of her
it was crazy like it it's called Laguna
Beach and so it inspired me to do this
makeup tutorial so I figured I would
share this bag with you guys in this
tutorial since I'm gonna be using the
color from the bag which inspired the
whole entire look fab is weird but it's
weird to me because that's not what
normally happens with me and my videos
but monthly only cost 10 bucks a month
and you get like three to four full-size
lip products I mean look how much stuff
came in my bag though I got this one
from Oprah two from City color ones
purpley and ones like a deep pink and
then I got a hot pink from LA girl I got
some cargo gloss and they even got an
Oprah Universal brow pencil like this
bag was loaded up okay thank you
I look monthly I'll have them listed
down below if you want to check it out
ten bucks a month you can go on their
website and read more and learn more
about it now this is for my lip lovers
though so you got to be a lip lover and
it gives you a chance to try out all
kinds of different lip colors and it's a
cheap way to build your makeup
collection because I know a lot of
people were like how do you build a big
makeup collection because that's how
girls go we love some makeup okay we
love makeup this is a headband that I
bobby pin around my neck so three points
for creativity you're excited to turn
yourself into a Kylie Jenner kind of
basically her everyday basic look well
then just keep watching my little honey
bunny
first I'm gonna go in with my make up
forevers step one this is the smooth and
blur primer and I'm just gonna apply
this to area that needs a little bit of
softening up if you will and basically
this just fills in any pores so that way
your foundation lays on top of your skin
looking flawless next I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of this infallible Pro
matte foundation from L'Oreal her face
is super matte I don't see any shimmer
and it's obviously the filter but I love
the way the filter has her face looking
so that's what we're gonna be going for
and I got my damp Beauty Blender out I
actually quit being lazy and I got up
and I dampened it
then amigo my honest how she Beverly
Hills brow Wiz and I'm gonna fill in
these brows she has this gradient brows
that are really light in the front and
then there you go darker towards the end
so I'm gonna kind of create that
now finish up the tail end of my brow a
little bit a dip brow pomade by honest
awesome ever list I'm gonna add a little
bit of the Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
all over these eyelids using the Urban
Decay Naked basics palette I'm going to
grab this shade foxy and I'm gonna blend
it all over my lid this isn't a 38 brush
from Sigma thanks I Jenky eyebrow right
there you see that patch I'm gonna go in
with crave which is just a matte black
color I'm gonna put a little bit on the
end of an angled brush
excuse me I'm gonna run it literally
just right at those lashes kind of like
an eyeliner
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
Venus which is like this shimmering
light color and I'll apply it right to
the brow bone
she always has that super highlighted
brow bone and Venus East being my go-to
I don't wanna quit using it this palette
just got lost I'll go in with a little
bit of Naked 2 which is like the
lightest cool tone brown color and with
that same a35 I'm just gonna blend that
in the crease I mean you're barely gonna
be able to see it but give us a little
something-something
I'm gonna load up on the benefit they're
real mascara and we're gonna add some
false lashes Kylie
always seems to have on false lashes
which I'm like hey girl some of my false
lashes mm-hmm in the process of putting
my lashes on but I'm gonna be using
Lilly ghalichi Los Angeles and Paris
because they're really thin and really
wispy and I'm gonna double stack them
because I'm being super dramatic but I'm
like Hollies dramatic - here goes wait
which ones oh man I mixed them up I'm
pretty sure these are Los Angeles they
look a lot like the Ardell dimming with
feet but on Sirius no she always wears
wispy wispy wispy lashes like and she's
always wearing false lashes
look how spidery that looks that looks
like her lashes I'm telling you
my lashes are drying I'm gonna do my
highlight area and Kylie is known for
super dramatic light under eye so I'm
gonna do a super dramatic light under
eye but I will tell you um it doesn't
look good on her you know
she rocks it well I will say no jealous
just gonna Beautyblender sout just a tip
whenever your Beauty Blender and I say
this in a lot of videos but you don't
want to swipe you want to Pat because
you don't want to move around your
highlight you just want to push it in to
get it blended in rather than move it
you know what I mean it will blend it
and it just takes a little more time
then go in with a little bit of my
Inglot highlighting powder it's almost
like a banana powder isn't it cosmetics
brush and I'm just going to get some on
the in and I'm going to push it in
/ cheeky piggies or super super bronze
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of my
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer and
this little brush from Ally beauty and
I'm gonna contour but then I'm gonna go
back in and just like really bronze it
up
and tell you guys I'm gonna sweep off
the excess once it's done
melting cooking into my skin so
basically my body heats gonna warm up
the product and it's what's gonna stick
it to what's gonna stick and then I'll
brush away the extra and then it's gonna
leave me with a really soft white
under-eye or not white but you know like
lightened I'm looking at my viewfinder
thorn and get a little bit more bronzer
on this morphe brush this is an m3 33
and I'm gonna contour my nose her nose
is a little bit wider than mine so I'm
gonna bring out the contour a little bit
further just come down I think it's time
I'm gonna just brush away any excess
looks like she has just a little bit of
color on her cheeks I'm gonna be going
in with sweet pea from City color super
affordable mom blush I'm just gonna add
a little bit very lightly just to give
us a little flush
to the eyes I'm going to be going in
with a little bit of naked - and faint I
start flushing yeah I'm under eye area
it looks like she's has this smoked out
just a little bit
X I'm going to go in with a little bit
of craving an angled brush and just add
it to the tip of the brush I'm going to
run this across the lower lash line just
as close as I can get to those lower
lashes add a little bit more that w OS
color I'm just going to like lightly
smoke this I'll make it looks offer
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
Dean this is the mr. right now just a
black eyeliner pencil from the bomb and
I'm literally just gonna cover color in
that inner corner it doesn't meet by
going with a little bit of Brian these
are so cute like the name chicken are
calm eyes and this is a nude color so
I'm just gonna really fill in that
waterline to open our eyes and make them
look around this so here's the fun part
I'm gonna go in with soar by Mac this
lip liner her lips are very overdrawn
then I'm gonna over draw mine quite a
bit I'm gonna cheaper kylie jenner look
I'm gonna start my real line and I'm
just gonna go up and over what it really
is
then for my lip monthly like I told you
I'm gonna be using Oprah's Laguna Beach
which is a liquid lipstick from Oprah
funny story I almost completely forgot
to add mascara to my lower lashes so do
that I'm also gonna add just a little
bit of that Venus color just to the Lynx
ball up my nose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
