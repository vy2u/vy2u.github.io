channel I'm wearing contacts and not to
freak you out a little bit but I do
still have brown eyes and these are
temporary contacts in today's video
we're going to be reviewing some pieces
from the kylie jenner birthday
collection as well as the Chi shadow
palette I'm going to give you a first
impressions of it and then I'm going to
do a short tutorial with my eyes and
then swatch all home on my lips and it's
gonna be real good I've already taken
with the Chi shadow palette a little bit
so I'll give you a rundown on my
thoughts on that Frank Gabriel Zamora
who has an awesome YouTube channel he
did a tutorial and review of the Kylie
eye shadow palette so be sure and watch
that video I will have it linked right
on down below check it out tell my
friend Gabriel hello and subscribe to
his channel he's really awesome I just
have like my foundation and my concealer
and contour like set right now and my
face is ready to go for some eye shadow
and lip products which is what we're
focusing on in this video you haven't
subscribed to my channel already I don't
know why you haven't subscribe before
you leave
join the youtube madness on my channel
and we're gonna jump right in and get
started first let's do a little rundown
of the Chi I shadow palette I will put
marker points right here when the
tutorial stars and whenever we go over
the lip products so you can decide where
you want to skip around in the video
what you want to get out of the video
hell maybe you want to watch the whole
video that would be cool alright first
it comes in this box which I think the
design on the box is very pretty I
believe these are her eyes if they're
not her eyes that would be a little
weird whose eyes are these this is the
bronze palette um and then she showed on
her snapchat she's obviously making lots
more I show palette so this is the first
of many the front of the palette looks
like this and it's got the eyes again
with some metallic bleeding which is so
dope and then on the back of the palette
it just says Kylie XO the bronze palette
and the name of the eyeshadow shades
will open the palette up I totally wish
there was a mirror and the palette but I
get it if you put them here in the
palette the price of the palettes just
gonna go at the end of the day if you
want to spend less money be thankful
there's not a mirror in the palette get
your own mirror oh car appellate cos
benign circular I should have shades
about the same size
smack of make it actually they are the
same size as maqam a cupcake if I die
compare the quality of the eyeshadows to
anything I would definitely say they are
make it peak quality which as most of us
know makeup geek has really awesome
eyeshadows I like the quality of the
eyeshadows and the palette you get 7
mattes it took me a minute think about
that who seven mattes and to shimmer
eyeshadows the shades are very neutral
palette to me if I'm gonna be brutally
honest it's very plain to me it's very
plain basic eyeshadow palette like like
I said this is probably one of many
she's showing her scepter she's making
lots more palettes so maybe her first
one is just like her neutral little
basic palette I created a palette
volleyball sand it's really freakin hard
to please everyone so it's hard for me
to complain about any aspect of makeup
after the Hat because it's like really
difficult when I was going through
Kylie's Instagram I noticed that most of
her makeup looks are pretty nothing
they're basic they're all very beautiful
but she's a very neutral Gow you don't
see you're wearing greens and purples
and blues and things like that she
always has on warm tone bronzy eyes
always her first eyeshadow palette I
expect nothing less than this I totally
wish the palette had the names of the
shadows underneath them rather than on
the back I don't know if that's just
like a beauty blogger thing or if that's
an everybody thing maybe she wanted to
keep it clean looking and nice with just
the bold Kylie but just like I love when
the shadow names were placed under here
because I've been messing things
oh man it just gets really bad you get a
little card with the palette which kind
of makes you look you have a wonky eye
if you wander around and talk with it
see that I like have a wonky eye umm
these contacts kind of make me look like
I have a wonky eye he's really cute
little detail and then on the back of
the palette um get it I hope you adore
them as much as I do I love you I let's
jump into the birthday collection you
get the little Kylie black card whereas
this one was a little different and on
the back it's my birthday I wanted to do
something special for you guys to help
me celebrate this has been an amazing
gear because of the love you guys have
shown me because the love you have shown
and Kylie cosmetics EXO Kylie xoxo
Gossip Girl
so what I got for the birthday
collection I try to get the bag with all
of it of course my little fingers
weren't working fast enough I'm like a
Peter I couldn't get it I got the dark
bronze was just the cream liner or cream
base and it comes with DI oh god it
comes with the eyeliner and the brush so
it comes with a little pot like this I
love the labeling on it and the gold I
think it's so pretty little eyeliner
brush is just a slanted eyeliner brush
this has Kylie and gold to match the
little pod whenever u s-- march down
into it the products a little bit darker
than when it looks like on top o her but
it is very even do you ever mess with
some gel pots and it's like sometimes
they're almost clear they're not very
pigmented but this is like a dark brown
with golden flecks and it's very pretty
very pretty I'm definitely gonna
incorporate this in the tutorial today
and show you how I'll use that then you
get a liner the liner pretty much looks
identical to the pod except for the
liner it's just a wee bit deeper and
that might be because I can press harder
with the pencil versus with the brush if
the light hits that in the club girl you
ain't free drinks on that I got leo
with packaging is gold which is just
sickening I love it
I've had Kylie Jenner's lipsticks before
and they were quite drying on me I have
a hat Posie K and I have three of them
and they're pretty drying on me like if
I had to give it a like a 1 out of 10 I
give him a 6
just because I'm they were they cracked
on me and they're a little bit
uncomfortable to wear I don't know how
these gonna be I'm gonna try them on for
you and let you know it looks very
pretty on my hand and then you get the
matching lip pencil with it and I love
the gold detailing on the bottle next I
got Lourdes which looks like this this
is a shimmery liquid lipstick and this
is a golden shimmery liquid lipstick I
don't know if I would personally wear
this one on its own just because it's
just it would be like gold lips like
depends on how crazy I'm feeling that
day but I would moreso wear this as a
lip topper on top of another liquid
lipstick or like mix it in Lord did not
come with a lip liner because
like a metallic and then I got the gloss
poppin which is it looks at you almost
just like Lord but it's in gloss form so
it's a little bit more shiny than Lord
the glosses look very nice they're not
too goopy they have a medium texture to
them and I don't know about these two
I'm going to try these out and tell you
about the dress
pop is actually kind of a clear lip
gloss per se this is it on my lips right
now and it's not too goopy at all a
little bit of an opaque gold to it and
then that's about it alright next up we
have Lord
I just tried on and it is way more
pigmented than pop him but I don't
actually like a yellowy gold and I don't
actually care for it that much like I
said I might use it as a lip topper
rather than keep learning it on its own
because it was just too much shade look
it's just not for me not saying it's a
bad lip color I just I personally will
not see myself wearing this and my
lashes are gonna crusty we're all going
to pretend that they're not kind of
crusty and then Ryan coming in this Chi
palette I'm going to first go in with
this little shade right here oh man see
I'm going to messy shades up topaz and
I'm going to blend it all over this will
help set my Mac Paint Pot that I have
down my lashes are hella crusty like ill
next up I'm going to go in with this
shade so the next shade actually went
into was topaz and I use my a 38 brush
from Sigma shadows do blend nicely
they're not insanely pigmented or
insanely powdery or anything like that I
think they're like medium quality like
they're nice you know they're I think
it's worth the price if you charge much
more than this though I definitely would
say not worth the price but I think as
you can see like the mattes do have nice
color payoff next I'm going in with
obsidian I'm going to take my little e25
brush from Sigma this is my favorite
blending brush and don't forget guys
have a discount code with them it's
Laura
Sigma to get money on your brushes and
I'll have everything I'll use link down
below
oh but I just took that color and
blended it right into the crease then I
took my dark bronze this is that little
pot I think it's meant to be an eyeliner
pretty much but I ended up using it kind
of like a shadow base gotta say that as
a lid topper I'm not quite as obsessed
with the dark bronze not as obsessed
whatever reason I feel like the swatch
on my hand was prettier than it actually
being on my eyelid we're gonna make it
cute though next shade I use is bronze
I'd which is this is a matte deep brown
color I'm taking an e30 tube brush I'm
going to pop that to blend out the harsh
line where the clay pot stops and I
should have start so you want that to
have a gradient fill and then I took in
a little bit more on my e25 brush a
little bit fluffier brush and blended it
out then I actually ended up going in
with the I think it's called Goldstone
which is the bronzy color and just added
it right on top to give it some shimmery
appearance I then took the first shade
we used and blowed it all the way from
inner to outer corner on the lower lash
line I make sure that was nice and
smoked out and then I ended up going on
with obsidian is smoking out the lower
lash line a little bit more and adding
some mascara and some inner rim liner
from Tarte to my inner room to really
make the eyes pop then I went in with
icon lashes these are drunk in love
I'm obsessed with these lashes and I pop
those on next up I'm going to be using
leo which is the reddish shade and I did
wear this for a little bit it was
actually really nice on my lips when I
wore it with a lot of lip liner I don't
eat it but when a word alone it was a
little bit drying but I thought it'd
look really pretty and complement the
smoky bronze eye look alright guys that
is it for this tutorial
