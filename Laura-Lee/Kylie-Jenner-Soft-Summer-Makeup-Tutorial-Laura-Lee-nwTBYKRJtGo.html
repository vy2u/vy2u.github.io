guys welcome to my channel today's video
is going to be a Kylie Jenner inspired
makeup tutorial and of course I want to
be using my palette to do the tutorial
with I asked you guys on my snapchat
what celebrity look you wanted to see in
so many of you guys sent me this picture
right here and said you want to see this
look recreated so yo wishes my camera on
her
you knew the weirdness was going to come
out eventually here is my interpretation
of this look it is so light and soft on
the eyes which I wanted to do a soft
look with my palette anyways for you
guys with no winged liner and then I
didn't have blue context so I just put
my green contacts in what is that in my
hair
and we're gonna pretend that they're
blue today but I don't have any blue
ones so you know anyways we're gonna
jump right in and get started I hope you
enjoyed the video also be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
that way you don't miss out on any more
makeup creations subscribe today okay
we're going to jump right end up
starting out I like T Smashbox primer
water so lately this has been like my
holy grill I just feel like it makes the
makeup adhere to your face better and
then I go in with my luminous light
primer by hourglass this just gives you
a little bit of an era descent glow
right underneath iam makeup so it just
rubbing it all over the skin it's a
little bit moisturizing to help a dry
skin girl out next I'm gonna be going in
with my trusty at Studio Fix by Mac I'm
in shade NC 35 I get that question a lot
so helps you out and my camera stopped
recording right whenever I was applying
the foundation moving on I'm applying
pressed pot from my palette in my crease
just all over to soften up the Mac a
Paint Pot that I put down and then I go
in with Britches as our transition shade
this is only the best transition shade
in the whole wide world
I promise with an e25 brush I'm just
going to pop that right into the crease
working it in that outer corner a little
bit because I want it to be a little bit
smoked out in the outer corner then I'll
go in with Alabama and the exact same
brush I'm going to apply that right
mostly into the outer V of the eye you
can dust it on out and clean it up later
if you need more room to blend and
going to blend blend blend it out and
move whatever I have left on my brush
into the inner corner Laura you need a
stop girl okay moving on and let's skate
this is a Paint Pot by Mac and it's just
an ice-cream base with a little bit of a
soft pink glitter to the lid I'm going
to mix tickled pink and lauralee
together and press them on to let skate
right on top of my lid it's just going
to give us that soft pink eel eyelet
look that she's got going on and then I
soften it up with a little bit of
britches which was our transition shade
so we don't have any creasing this then
I'm going to go in with this flat brush
and LU which is a matte black color I'm
going to push this in to the lash line
that way whenever I put on my false
lashes you can't really tell or see the
skin on my lash line and I just smoke
that out with this flat edge brush time
for lashes yeah I'm going to be using my
lash curler to give them a little lift
and this superhero mascara from it this
was the first time I ever tried it and
honestly I like their other mascara
hello lashes better than this one so
then I'm using Lily lashes I believe
these are in YC I'm going to pop these
right on if you don't want to do lashes
booboo do you don't apply them just
build up your favorite mascara because I
know a lashes are just a lot they're
heavy and yes even I think they're
annoying next I'm going to add sugar on
to the brow bone that's why I added this
color to my palette and I ended up using
it for everything but this really pops
the brow bone and lifts the eye look I'm
going to be using my Born This Way
concealer which is lightly been my
all-time favorite concealer I use shade
light just to highlight the face and
make those areas pop a little bit and
look brighter and more awake I haven't
obsessed with this concealer like I use
it like every day it's like twice it
okay only once day but every day and
then lately I've been dampening my
Beauty Blender with a little bit of mac
fix+ spray because it helps to blend out
the concealer whenever the concealer
sits on your face too long it's dry it's
really hard to blend out but the more
damp your PE Blender is especially with
the mac fix+ spray it is bomb-diggity
then i'm going to go in with my morphe 9
C palette and push this banana shade
into the lower lash line
talk about to my lower eye area guys I'm
tired at Laura Mercier chose isn't
powder I'm like I've got to use
something else we have to switched up so
I've been using this lately and I've
really been enjoying it to bronze up the
skin and give me a slight contour i'm
going in with laguna from NARS this is
one of my favorite bronzers and I'm
using this angled contour brush I'm
being a little bit more messy with it
because I want my skin to not just look
really structured and contour is
summertime and I wanted to look like
it's been a little sunkissed in a bit
more bronze and don't forget to do your
jawline just don't do too much because
it'll like you have a five o'clock
shadow now I'm going in with flower
child by Becca cosmetics this is a nice
cute pink color just to give a little
pinch of color to the cheeks and I'm
going to be using this honest Tashia
glow kitten Sun dip it's so delicious
such a gross way to describe this but I
just feel like highlighting awakens the
makeup and just like brings it to life
so I'm using the yellow shade in the kit
called summer and this little F I think
it's their f-35 from Sigma and then I'm
going to set everything happily then I'm
going to go in with macaron from honest
Tashia Beverly Hills and I'm going to
smoke out the lower lash line Kylie
Jenner has am really light colors on her
lower lash line so I'm gonna have light
colors on my lower lash line then I go
in with my Tarte enter realm liner and
just apply this to the waterline to open
up the eyes I normally do two coats of
this and then I switched over to my
hello lashes might hit cosmetics because
I didn't really care for the superhero
mascara and really give those lower
lashes a good coats because kylie
jenner's lashes were poppin they always
are now I'm going to take that sugar
shade that we used on the brow bone
remember a while back and pop that into
the inner corners because this is just
gonna make us look even more open eyed
wide eyed and waking gorgeous and lovely
and I love it so much
next I'm going to take Aquarius by
colour-pop in Overland the hell up out
my lips come through Kylie Jenner filler
lips yes I love me so much and I'm just
gonna yeah overlined my lips then I'm
going to take my pure lippy and this one
is in oh babe this is actually my
favorite one of all of them and it's
really close to the code that she was
wearing it's a nice whipped matte color
I'm going to apply this all over my lips
you know a little bit over lining and
this is the final look thank you guys so
much for being here and watching I love
you guys so much and if you haven't
