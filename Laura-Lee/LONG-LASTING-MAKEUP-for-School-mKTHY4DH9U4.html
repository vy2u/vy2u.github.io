makeup total if I said that so far
today's makeup tutorial is going to be a
tutorial on how to make your makeup last
all day all day long I wish you all that
for school and for work I know whenever
we're at school or work or busy all day
we do not have time to constantly touch
up our faces and keep it flawless
looking so I'm going to show you a bunch
of tips and tricks on how to keep your
makeup looking flawless and keep it
hanging in there all day long in this
video so I hope you're excited also
we'll be using some products from
Scandinavia which you guys have heard
about and when i snapchatted about these
it was so funny
I was just showing you guys like
unboxing these and you guys were like
those are the best thing ever like
tweeting me well that I agree I have
used these before I have the finishing
spray and the primer spray gonna be
using them both in this tutorial a cool
little backstory on these is the
Scandinavia setting sprays a founder
within a Miami nightclub and he saw so
many girls melting away with their
makeup because it is so humid in so hot
in that area and like from experience
just him seeing that he developed this
product it felt that that was a really
cool backstory to share with you guys
that this product wasn't just developed
with the thought of people's make it
melting off but actually seeing it and
experiencing it and then be like hey we
gotta fix this product is
temperature-controlled and it is the
only product that is proven to make
makeup lasts for 16 hours
I do recommend these for Olli in
combination skin they're some of the
best products for that because they are
all free and they're paraben free and
they are silicone free so they're not
gonna leave your skin feeling greasy
they're actually gonna help your makeup
stay intact longer I highly recommend
these to you guys literally this is one
of the best setting sprays out there on
the market I know you've heard it ranked
about on YouTube and it's for a reason
so I have a link in a promo code for you
guys to get 10% off one setting spray in
one primer spray plus free shipping on
orders over 25 you want to check that
out that will be right down in the
description box I wanted to give you a
rundown about this tutorial before we
did it and now we're ready so let's jump
right in
you how to make your makeup laughs the
first thing we're gonna do in this
tutorial is we're gonna prime our skin
be using it these Scandinavian primer
spray as I mentioned in the beginning is
a video so you want to shake it up
really well to get everything mixed up
because it's been setting their best
results you're gonna want to spray it
into eggs and then at a like 2 to 4
spray I like to get my face good and
covered I really like to like fill it on
my skin and then it dries really quick
but this is essential in to making your
makeup last longer prime your skin so go
in with a little bit of foundation I
found liquid foundation can last a
little bit longer than just a regular
powder I'm using the Maybelline matte
and poreless foundation and be taking
the f80 kabuki and I'm just gonna blend
that out all over my skin I'm gonna go
in with my e-40 brush from sigma and dip
into a little bit of peach smoothie
which I always use this color to start
off with and this is just gonna be like
our nice soft transition shade I'm just
gonna blend that all in the crease with
my 825 brush from Sigma I'm gonna pick
up a little bit of creme brulee and I'm
just gonna blend that right in the
crease as well and I'm just gonna focus
it right into the actual crease of my
eyeball working it in windshield wiper
motions just back and forth back and
forth and then I'm just gonna blend it
up a little bit we're gonna be building
up just a couple of colors nothing
dramatic after all this is just like a
super simple back to school makeup
tutorial or to work whatever you're
doing I'm just gonna pick up a pinch of
cocoa bear and I'm gonna blend that
right in the crease this is just gonna
deep enough our look just a little bit
and I give it a little warmth you can
actually skip this stuff if you want to
cuz I really want my eyeshadow to last
and not to crease up I'm just gonna grab
a little bit more of that primer using
my f70 concealer brush and I'm gonna
apply this on the lid just because we
had a little bit eyeshadow fall down on
to our primer
exhale grab a little bit of this shadow
stick from NYX this one is in silk and
it's actually called an infinite shadow
stick and I'm gonna color on my eyelid
with it with my s-58 brush from Sigma
I'm gonna grab a little bit of it on the
brush and just smooth it out better I
can promise you that this ishow is not
gonna go anywhere because using cream
eyeshadows makes them last so much
longer versus a powdery eyeshadow
especially when we put a primer
underneath them I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of more PG liner in my EO Six
Sigma liner brush Jo liner lasts way
longer than pizza liner or a liquid
liner so I always recommend using gel
liner especially if you know you're not
gonna be able to touch up your makeup
for a while jo liner is the way to go I
wore gel liner every day throughout high
school because it lasted so what we're
gonna do is wing it out I typically
wouldn't wing it out in the past in my
school tutorials just because winged
liner wasn't such an everyday makeup
type of thing but nowadays I'm seeing
everybody wear wing liner like when you
check out anywhere homegirls got wing
liner on so we're gonna do wing liner if
you don't want to doing liner just do
regular liner
em I like them turned out way thicker
than I wanted it to but we're still
gonna roll with this tutorial because it
is so we'll do concealer not gonna do
all that jazz highlighting the face I'm
literally just gonna try to get rid of
some dark circles that's all just gonna
grab that same idea kabuki and Pat it
out so concealer will crease and it will
run and it will be a mess if you don't
set it setting your concealer is what's
gonna make it stay there and look
creaseless all setting your concealer is
is laying a powder down on top of it so
I'm gonna go in with this fit me powder
220 by Maybelline using the x.25 brush
from Sigma I'm going to press this into
my skin you will be very grateful that
you set your concealer and the forehead
now that we are all happy in awake
looking I'm just gonna go in with a
little bit of my BB Physicians Formula
bronzer literally just gonna add a
little bronzer here okay I'm just around
the face not really contouring just like
bronzing up the cheek area it's just the
place it says Sun light naturally hits
blush always being one of the first
things to go in makeup I'm actually
gonna use a cream blush this one by
Becca cosmetics it's like a powdery
cream blush therefore it sound really
gooey your greasy it kind of forms out
into a powder this is one other beach
tint summer souffles and this one is in
raspberry opal blend it out
just gonna take a blush brush and just
soften that up a little bit I'm gonna
curl my lashes with this lash curler
that is legit from the Dollar Tree and
then I'm gonna add a few coats of some
mascara now I'm gonna fill in my
waterline just because I want this make
us look to stay light and I didn't put
any eyeshadow on the lower lash line
we'll be working on the lips now I'm
gonna line the lips which is gonna help
any lip product you put on stay longer
so I'm going in with oh snap by
colour-pop cosmetics the line my entire
lips with it but that's really gonna
help this lipgloss that we're gonna put
on next which is rose by dose of colors
one there new ones it's gonna make it
last so much longer and can we talk
about how pretty this color is I think
so
last but not least a very essential part
and making your makeup last is to set it
with a finishing spray gonna be using
the skin to navy up makeup setting spray
that's going to help it not to crease
not to melt off our face do hang in
there tight all day long
yes and there you have it this is our
long lasting makeup tutorial and this is
gonna make your makeup last all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
