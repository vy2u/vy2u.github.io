take out my vampire teeth so I'd be able
to talk to you guys cuz they're a little
bit big I wanted to do a vampire
tutorial I've actually never done one of
these on my channel and I love the way
it came out it's obviously inspired by
Vampire Diaries which I know which they
just came out with season six I believe
on Netflix go ahead watch the whole
thing within like a day
mostly the eyes is inspired by damn damn
part hurry same hard hours cuz you know
they get all kinds of crazy this makeup
is gonna last you all last night long I
did use my skin and maybe a primer spray
to start with because I'm gonna go ahead
and tell you I've been doing a lot of
Halloween tutorials and it started to
make my face breakout it is very
important to prime your skin before you
put all this makeup and stuff on your
face because it's not normal makeup to
take care of your skin first
it also contains vitamins that helps
with redness uneven skin tones your
pores all kinds of good stuff in this
little bottle it starts to dry provides
like a sticky base so that that way your
makeup will stick to your face and it
will last all night long which is really
important whenever you're doing these
crazy looks that it laughs it's
something melting off halfway through
your night I love this primer so much
better than silicon based primers
because I feel like those just like
slough off your skin and by the way this
is all free and it's good for everyday
makeup too i've been using it on the
regular last time i mention this in a
video so many of you guys were like we
already know girl we love it and then i
did finish the look with the mattifying
finishing spray as well so uses both
supple get me a discount code called
treat to for 10% off your order plus two
travel-size bottles plus free shipping
off orders over 25 that'll be down below
we're gonna jump right in this to turn
this to turtle oh i can't talk to that
we're gonna jump right in this tutorial
and get started turning ourselves into a
vampire
what's up guys thanks for being here
starting out this tutorial I'm gonna be
priming my face with a Scandinavian
spray as mentioned in the intro then I'm
gonna go in with the two phase of Born
This Way Foundation and I'm gonna be
using shade porcelain which is about 80
shades too light for me
alright that was dramatic but the
lighting is trying to prove me wrong
here and it's kind of looking like it is
my shade but I assure you in person is
way too light then I'm gonna set this my
translucent powder which is gonna make
it even a little bit lighter and next
I'm gonna go in and prime my eyelids
with my paint pop I'm Mac I'm also gonna
prime it below my eyelids because we're
gonna be using a lot of shadow in the
under eye area first I'm gonna go in
with Peach Smoothie and this color you
don't have to use I'm just using it to
soften up the primer that way the other
shades blend nicely then I'll go in with
one my first Mac eyeshadows I ever owned
which is red brick by Mac why would this
be one of the first ones to buy I don't
know because I like color then I'm gonna
blend this into the crease I'm gonna
blend back and forth into the crease
working the color up pretty high and I'm
gonna bring it all the way around the
eye literally in a big circle I'm gonna
touch the inner corner down below making
sure I'm blending back and forth
everything looks nice soften gradient
this is gonna give us that warm dead
fill then I'm gonna go in with this
purple color from the lorac mega Pro you
can use whatever purple eyeshadow and
I'm gonna blend this into the crease and
do the exact same thing with it I'm
gonna bring it down and below and I'm
even gonna pop a little bit in the inner
corner making it look like I am a little
bit dead a little bit tired maybe hungry
too like a vampire next I'll go in with
a matte black eyeshadow I'm going to
pack this onto the lid this is really
what's going to give us that vampire
fill and I'm just gonna pack it on and I
know it looks harsh right there in the
crease but don't you worry because you
know we're gonna go in and we're gonna
blend it out also gonna take this color
and blend it all around the eye this is
your chance to make it look like you
have raccoon eyes if you have problems
with smokey eyes and it always turns out
looking like
nice well this is Horrell just might be
the one for you because I'm gonna do
that to myself but it's also gonna make
me look really cool and kind of vampire
II so I kind of like it you know I'm
going to sweep it on down and I'm gonna
blend it out now I'm gonna go back in
with that red brick break color and I'm
gonna blend this way down below and just
kind of bring it around the eye I'm
using an e25 brush from Sigma blend
blend blend and bring it on down way
lower than usual next I'm gonna add a
few coats of some mascara this is Too
Faced better than sex we're gonna add
false lashes towards the end just a V
ba-boom our face then I'm gonna say this
teeny teeny tiny little pin brush and I
grabbed a little bit of that matte black
eyeshadow I'm gonna take this at first I
started really slow taking this
swiveling it down my face with a super
light hand then I got pretty confident
with it and went kind of crazy with it
but I loved the outcome basically I just
repeat the step over and over until I
feel like I have enough veins popping
out from below my eyes because I am a
hungry vampire and my phone just went
off which I hope it didn't ruin this
voiceover okay this part I do love I'm
going in with a new contour brush by
morphe and I'm going to chisel out cheek
bones making it look like I'm super
skinny and I have sharp pointy
cheekbones that could cut somebody and
I'm gonna be using this fit of bronzer
I'm gonna start at the top of my earlobe
and bring it down and I'm gonna kind of
curve it around the cheekbone area to
make my cheeks really prominent now I'm
not going to blend this out as much as I
normally would because I'm trying to
give it those really skinny sunken and
face kind of look here which makes us
look dead and vampirey I really felt
like contouring the face like this made
the look
next we're need to go in with night moth
by Mac you can grab any dark lip liner
shade I'm just gonna line the lips I'm
actually gonna start to fill in the
inner corners a little bit of the lips
as you can see I'm doing a little bit
more than lining and then right in the
center of the lips we're gonna go in
with a bright red so any red lipstick
you have you can just fill in the center
of your lips mix it together and then
I'm gonna go back in with the liner just
to soften up everything and make it look
alright here's the part where I'm adding
false lashes I will link these down
below because I don't know which ones
they are off the top of my head sorry
then I'm gonna add a little bit of fake
vampire blood this is obviously optional
I mean this whole looks optional you
don't have to be a vampire if you don't
want to but I love the look and always
on Vampire Diaries after they get done
biting someone they have a little bit of
blood running down their face so that is
what inspired me to do it and then last
but certainly not least we're going to
finish it off with a little bit of
setting spray to lock it all in and that
way we stays empty all night long
hope you guys enjoyed this look please
subscribe before you leave and I hope to
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
