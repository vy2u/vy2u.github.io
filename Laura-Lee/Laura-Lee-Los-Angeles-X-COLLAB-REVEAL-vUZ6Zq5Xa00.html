channel today's video is definitely a
different one in a very very very
special one that is so dear to my heart
you guys don't even understand how dear
this is to me like this is one of the
greatest things I think I've ever had
the opportunity to do being on YouTube
this is like one of the top things I've
ever done we tell you what it is so you
guys can be excited with me hello I'm
just thinking about all my fields I'm
sitting here and thinking how I feel
right now anyways so today I'm going to
reveal what me Darley Los Angeles has
been working on for a while now and we
have decided to collaborate with a very
very special brand and the brand is so I
am very excited now it is not just color
pop we've collected with we've also
collab with no-kill la if you don't know
what it is that is an animal shelter
though color pop every year does a
collaboration with no-kill LA and if you
guys don't know I've never had a
store-bought pet before I've only had
shelter animals and have three cats
right now and they're all shelter
animals and I think it's very very very
important to use my social platform to
change the world for the better and this
is a huge opportunity that colour-pop
has given me so color crop collapse
window kill a no-kill la every year in
every year I snap it and support it and
use the products that come out with but
this year I was with colour-pop we were
chatting we started talking about
animals and we started talking about
cats
go figure Laura Lee starts talking about
cats and I was like yeah all three of my
council from the shelter we saved them
and they were like wow you know we
killed we you know we collab with
no-kill every year I was like yes I
absolutely do and I think it's one of
the most amazing things that you guys
could possibly do and then we were both
like wait a minute what if we did it
together and then like our worlds
collide it we were like duh hello
and I told colour-pop you know what I
want to do this and I don't want one
penny not one single penny from it I
don't want to make any money off this I
want every cent of this to go to no
Kilauea
I save animals and that's just what
we're gonna do so just so you guys know
going into this collab I am not making
any profit colour-pop is not making any
profit what makes a profit is the
animals there's all this is for us for
the greater good and and I'm so honored
to have an opportunity together there's
sometimes the universe just gives you on
this silver platter an opportunity to
give and that is a huge opportunity and
you know I find that whenever you give
you receive and I'm not giving to get
something back in return I'm giving to
change the world in this matter and and
every single one of you who buys this
collection will be giving and the
collections really awesome because I
created the whole entire collection I
created every color I chose every single
piece that is in it so I personally
created it but now I'm gonna tell you
guys a little bit more because I
definitely think you guys need to know
more about no-kill la and best friends
la which is owned by no-kill la and I
recently went there and put some footage
for you guys because I really want you
guys to see how clean and beautiful it
is to walk through a shelter and I
definitely encourage you guys please
adopt don't shop and you know I'm never
one to bash people who do shop for their
pets I'm never one to point the finger
and say you're a bad person because I
don't find that makes anyone change
their mind and that's not what I'm here
to do I'm not here to bash anyone I'm
here to encourage you to make a
difference and if you are looking for a
new animal this holiday season or you
want a new animal first be sure the
person you're getting for the animal for
wants the animal and make sure that that
animal isn't gonna get tossed around
because someone doesn't want it that you
gave it to just make sure the person
wants the animal and also I just
encourage you you know if someone wants
a specific special animal just walk
through a shelter you don't have to get
an animal from it but just walk through
an animal shelter first and then really
make that decision if you want to shop
afterwards and that is what I encourage
you to do so let me talk a little bit
about no kill la no kill la I have the
information my phone because I don't
want to say anything wrong and messed
myself up because this is very very very
important for me
so no tell la which is no kill loss
it's an initiative led by Best Friends
Animal Society which was the Animal
Society I was at and that's what you're
gonna see the footage from and is an
organization to end the killing of cats
and dogs and chant and shelters
throughout Los Angeles now this is just
the start guys I want to help them grow
this so big and change the world I'm
gonna get one free we're talking about
animals and cats dying come on in 2012
only fifty seven point seven percent of
cats and dogs were making it out of the
shelter alive guys that is pitiful
that's so sad 57% this here's the real
team would you guys like to know the
number of cats and dogs that were killed
eighteen thousand cats and dogs were
killed and put down could you imagine
how my number could have been changed if
people weren't shopping from puppy mills
I can't even imagine how that number
could be change if people would adopt
because people are still putting animals
in their home and taking care of animals
but they're shopping and I wish they
would adopt and 2016 remember that was
in 2012 so in 2016 the number was
reduced to three thousand two hundred
and thirty six eighty two percent
reduction in killings in just five years
2017 statistics from Los Angeles are
also encouraging for no killer legs
showing a 90 point for savory in January
that is insane and you know what it goes
to show you that projects that
colour-pop does is saving animals buying
the make up with the paw print on it
it's changing the world and saving
animals lives their planet is our planet
straightforward right spayed and
neutered services where they are needed
at most so that fewer animals go into
shelter an increase of adoptions so the
more animals are placed in new homes
step by critical step we believe that
together we can bring the number of pets
killed in Los Angeles so shelters to
zero and I believe we can do it I
believe the Lorelai's have the power to
do it put the address you guys can go to
the no-kill Oh like that I went to best
friends shelter in LA if you guys would
like to and I will just let you guys
know that the dogs are taking such real
care up there so sisters are so
beautiful they're the cutest puppies
that the cutest kittens of a few cutest
full-grown dogs they train the dogs they
train
to go ahead and learn their manners to
sit to be taken out to go poo poo pee
pee and they take such good care of home
and I know shelters get a bad rap you're
gonna see all these half dead animals
that's not what it is at oh you see the
most precious happy animals you've ever
seen and they just want a home but also
a no-kill away they also take the
animals back if it doesn't work out for
you in your home and the dog is just not
working out at your home I also filmed a
puppy dog that has been there the
longest he's been there for two years
and no one has adopted him I would have
taken him right then and there but the
dog has to be on his own with no other
animals I have three cats it wouldn't
have worked out very well but it is the
sweetest most playful great dog ever and
it just doesn't get along very well with
other animals in the home they said it
does get along pretty well with other
animals that dog parts and stuff like
that but in its home it doesn't so it
really really really needs a home by
itself and someone to love it so if you
are looking for a one animal home this
dog is perfect for you if you're in the
Los Angeles area and this goes out to
not just you know this is me speaking to
people all over the world adopt don't
job you guys go to your local shelter
then it's so cute they have so many
kitten rooms which I got to visit the
kitten room and they saved they gave me
the number that this specific best
friend Center saved and let me just tell
you this how many kittens this specific
place saved this year which the money's
gonna go to 3039 baby kittens have been
say that would have been euthanized at
this shelter and just so you're aware
peach is one of those kittens and also
just so you're aware I have the best
cats on the planet Earth they are so
well-mannered they're so so so so loving
they're not weird angry or mean to
people whatsoever do the best cats and
they altar came out Michelle here's the
makeup I did for super shock shadows I
really love their super shock shadows
and the best part is these are
affordable they're five dollars apiece
but we are gonna bundle them and you'll
save two bucks because there's eighteen
dollars for the bundle of the eye shadow
quad so it did total of four colors the
first color I want to share with you
guys is heinie
I made the names of them prime shiny
hiny and red singlets I think it's so
cute so the first one and they have the
UM rose gold paw on the front of the lid
the first one is a coppery pinky peach
color with lots of glitter in it very
beautiful for the holidays very sparkly
it looks so so so so so pretty on the
eyelid I'm absolutely obsessed this is
like one of the prettiest colors I've
ever seen in my life
oh and the best thing is super shock
shadows they're like cream shadows so
they're super super pigmented but they
go on like a powder so they don't crease
and all that stuff's color I'm gonna
share with you guys is the lips so this
one is a pinky this was a really
interesting color I wanted to make I
want to make a peachy pink but a little
bit of a brown mob undertone to it when
you blend it out it is a lighter pink
color but if you build it up it turns
into a deeper mommy color the reason I
put it in this palette because it goes
so so well as a transition shade with
the other colors like it needed the the
collection needed this color as a great
transition shade so everything flowed
very well the next color is Ritz now I
created this one and I think it is
absolutely the best holiday color ever
and you know how people always say
glitter is the devil of the beauty world
because you can't get rid of it well
this is the way to wear a glitter
eyeshadow so if you swatch it or if you
look at it in the container you think
it's a little bit of a topi shiny color
but whenever you used to watch at the
taupe kind of fades away and it's just
like this clear stick on glitter color
you can use it with no eye pride I
should have primary put it on with to
your finger or you can put it with on
with a glitter glue I'm gonna do a
tutorial at the end of the video and I'm
gonna show you guys how I got this whole
entire look with my eyes and lips I
create it shiny
now shiny is a really really pretty
color you see like this warmth home
brown in the pan but when ever used to
watch it it is like a warm toned Brown
with a red and golden frosty undertone
to it and you can like see it in the
light and see it flickering on your hand
is such an interesting fiery coal color
and that's what I have all over my
eyelid today I'm obsessed with this
color it is okay next up for the lippies
I did three lippies the first one is a
lip gloss so this one is the ultra
glossy lip and this one is called glam
and I think it is literally the
prettiest gloss ever honestly this is
most just like a highlighter for your
lips because if you can see it just
makes your lips it's clear but it has
like so much shine to it so it's very
very very wearable very beautiful again
you can wear it on your own personally
like it over like a nude if you want
your nude to have a little bit of like
shine to it or pop to it if you put on a
matte nude or a liquid lipstick this is
so so so so pretty on top of it and the
best part is the three lippies are gonna
be bundled for 15 bucks
originally six dollars a piece so you
definitely get a discount there the next
color I created glam this is an ultra
metallic lippy
now glam I wanted to create is very
interesting I wanted to create a satin
lip which is perfect for this time of
year but I want it to be very wearable
for every skin tone see it's not
necessarily golden it has that rosy
coppery hue to it it's so creepy and
it's not drying it's not gonna crack on
your lips it's very very very
comfortable to wear lastly I'm really
excited about this color this one is it
BAM and this is quite the BAM color it's
the one I have on my lips right now and
it is a satin so this is not gonna dry
it out completely but as you can see
I've been talking my head off no cracks
whatsoever it just on the mouth you
don't got to worry about a thing honey
baby dolls I think it is oh so this is
so pretty again if I touch my hands it
will call my hands it doesn't dry down
but so pretty so comfortable it's gonna
look like this all night it's not gonna
dry down so you're not gonna have to
worry about being uncomfortable chipping
away but yeah I'm obsessed I'm
absolutely obsessed this is the best
possible way to wear a dark lippy a
satin because if you can see it looks
somewhat matte on my lips but you don't
have to deal with it fading or cracking
or getting the ball whole lips from it
because it stays in place and this is
very very very long wearing I wore it to
an event the other night and I work for
hours had talked and drink water and I
came home and lips the Blues are saying
I love you guys so much
and I appreciate you guys letting me use
my platform for this you guys you know
subscribing to my channel and and being
a part of the LA relatio

so grateful for this opportunity I'm so
so grateful I get to put my name on and
do this I mean I'm so proud of myself
for being able to do this and I love you
guys to death so without further ado I'm
going to go ahead and jump right into
the makeup tutorial and show you guys
how to put this makeup to use this

they agreed so we have a lot of product

a part of this I love you guys so much
and yeah let's jump into this story
she's just purring she'll go to sleep
here if I could hold her here all day
I'm gonna go in with glitz which is our
pinkier shade I'm gonna take a our 13:9
brush and all you have to do with these
cream shadows is they literally it just
swirled it around and you don't have to
tap off it's such a happy face so it's
still tap off I can't fit but you don't
have to tap off because they're more of
a creamy shadow that turns into a powder
they're very interesting so you don't
step off you can just go into blending
you're not gonna get any fallout and
that's just a bonus with super suction
super shock shadows rush rush rush off
when I take the lighter pinky shade and
kind of use it as our transition shade
and blend it right into the crease and
this r39 brush is a medium sized blender
so it's perfect for this you just want
it back and forth back and forth back
and forth this is one my favorite shades
I wear it non-stop actually all for my
favorite shades but just in different a
different way but I really really really
love
color it's so pretty I'm gonna do now is
go in with this really pretty called
shiny don't you love that it is shiny
actually it's so much shiny that it's
like a brown color but once you swatch
it it like has this red golden spice to
it it's a very interesting color I'm
gonna use the same brush I'm gonna start
to pull in that and again I just swirled
the brush around the color and these are
so pigmented guys and I love that
there's no fallout so you get a ton of
pigment but no fall out if you can see
here I'm just gonna cover the whole
eyelid with this color and a little bit
goes a long way this look literally took
me all three seconds to do I know I'm
being dramatic maybe like five minutes
to do and now I'm gonna take this Ritz
color which is super sparkly so I'm
going to pop this in the inner corner
and I want to do a holiday look with
this color too putting this all over my
eyelid and then putting the deep red
look on um this color so it was so
glittery that it would be me just using
the one color probably with like a brown
transition shade and then putting the
red lip on and that's why I didn't do
that look for this video because I want
to show you guys it's kind of how to use
three of the colors at least instead of
just one of the colors and I have
another video coming up using the Capri
pink shade with glitter to it so I can
keep showing you guys how to use these
marvelous colors going to add a very
thin stripe of black liner buff it in
and then I'm going to pop on a lash and
I'll be right back next up I'm gonna go
back in with Shawna Shawna Shawna you
guys see the sheen on it okay so anyways
I'm gonna take it on a pencil brush this
is an e36 and now I'm going to connect
right there and I'm gonna blend that out
in the lower lash line
with the same brush I'm gonna take lips
and I'm just gonna smoke it out a little
bit that way there's no harsh line use
that same brush and this is the final
look using the collection I think it's
so beautiful I hope you guys like the
look I think it looks so pretty
and I hope you guys will join me on this
journey and yeah also I think it makes a
great Christmas present as well some
with ease and eyeshadows a girl a boy
which is my cute stuff and stocking
stuffers as well I love you guys thank
you so much for being here watching and
thank you for this journey and thank you
