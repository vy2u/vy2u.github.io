man's hands yeah
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be my Mac haul for the
back Cinderella collection she's bad
guys sniffing candles I did do an order
however I was gonna stay awake until 2
a.m. and just order everything and then
I fell asleep I did wake up at 9 o'clock
and I did order whatever was left
another thing I wanted to with you guys
now really really quick is a lot of
people on YouTube like to steal videos
in order to get views on those videos
and then make money off of those videos
and I caught three channels and I didn't
catch on three channels have been caught
doing it already and because of you guys
letting me know I was able to get the
videos sound really quick so I just
wanted to say if you see my videos on
another channel just show me a comment
tweet me snap me just she's like Arnie
if I make up just let me know really
quick and I could have those videos
removed cuz you ain't still about work I
didn't get everything that I wanted but
that's okay we'll get past it I'm gonna
show you guys what all I got and I'll
also be like little mini review so you
guys can see because it's coming out in
stores March 5th which is very very
simple to hear inside it and seeing this
collection well then please keep
watching
the first thing I'll pull out of my
little box the Box is the Cinderella
eyeshadow this is stroke of midnight and
it's all kinds of silk clothes great UPS
man literally just dropped it off and I
was so excited looks like this the
packaging is light blue and it has the
gorgeous Disney's Cinderella written
across it and it is a beautiful neutral
palette definitely everyday wearable and
I haven't watched the colors yet so I
did by the heirloom mixed palette and
the colors just didn't have that great
of pigment sometimes it's not the same
formula I feel like like this is one of
those things in my head
conspiracy things but I feel like it's
just not the same formula when they put
them in this little palette but they
seem a little bit pigmented like I mean
I'm not seeing too big a problem oh here
I wanted a new noodle what is that it
scares me
moving on three shimmers and three matte
colors and they're all neutrals it's
super wearable but I know a lot of
people buy these palettes just to keep
not to use and then I got the Mac
fluidline macro violet macro violence oh
it's so cute the little blue lid and I
heart open and this is just a plum
colored flute line eyeliner by Mac it's
so cute up just cute as a button
actually picked up the other fluid line
this is little black bow and I believe
this is just gonna be a black fluid line
no it's not apparently I didn't even
look but this is a metallic go I don't
know it's like a charcoal granite grey
fluid line it looks really pretty I've
used that fluid lines for a really long
time and I've used multiple colors of
them and they make great eye shadow
bases and then the black ones make great
eyeliner eyeliner speak I mean of course
you could use these as a cool color to
eyeliner if you wanted to but most the
time I use these for eye shadow bases
the next thing I got was
max Cinderella's glass slipper oh I
think this is the lip gloss so I did get
the lip gloss that I wanted and this one
like says glass slippers just a really
iridescent glittery
oh gosh a really pretty lip gloss color
it's just a glaze and this is actually
something that I might wear like I said
a lot of these collection pieces I just
like to have this is a pretty pretty
glaze just to set on top of a lip color
in the packaging it's just tada
next I got pearl varnish pearl varnish
that is a weird name my gosh I don't
know what it is about the packaging but
like this iridescent purpley blue
shimmery color
this is actually an eye gloss so you can
just put this on your eye as your
eyeballs lip gloss oh I don't know if I
like it this is an eye gloss stickier
than the lip gloss it feels like goo oh
no I feel like my eyes would be sealed
if I use this pearl more - studio I
coughs OH
glue it's so pretty - it's a really
sparkly it reminds me of Cinderella
but it's iord Oh like my eyelids would
be like then I ended up getting my first
Mac mascara and it is the Cinderella so
it's like this baby blue with this
iridescent sparkle oh so obsessed what
is my problem
Laura you need to get over it it's just
so beautiful and this is like okay we
have hair everywhere story of my life
but the wand of it is a nice prickly one
and I love prickly ones because it helps
to like lift up those little lashes that
like to shoot out straight I wonder if
Mac mascaras are good I've never tried
them this is a first for me
and that is everything I bought six
pieces of the collection
that's all I could get my little hands
on I definitely missed out on the
lipsticks and the powder anyways thank
