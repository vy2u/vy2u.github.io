welcome to my channel today's video is
going to be all about Mac lip liners
we're going to go over my Mac lip liner
collection I'm gonna be lip swatching
we're gonna talk about my favorites and
I'll even go over some of the lipsticks
that they pair great with most of all
Mac's lipsticks all of them a clip
sticks because their microphones liners
which I mean I know they can go with a
lot of different lipsticks but we're
focusing on Mac today I hope you guys
are interested in knowing more about
Mac's lip liners it's kind of a random
video like who talks about lip liners
most people talk about lipsticks but I'm
here today chalk lip liners with you
guys I hope you're interested in
learning about them and if you are keep
watching I will see you very soon begin
our chit chat video talking about the
Mac lip liners I have seven different
Mac lip liners that I want to talk about
today and they are my favorites all over
my favorites which is weird I know okay
it's weird but we'll go over my most
favorite one which is probably the most
popular lip liner in the entire universe
I know that's a lot but Kylie Jenner did
a number on us whenever she came out
saying that her famous overdrawn lips
was done with sore was done is done she
still rocks them all the time
sore just blew up you couldn't find it
anywhere for a hot minute there I mean
it was bright bright you would have
thought that the color sore was the
answer to world hunger I don't know but
I'm gonna admit I was one of the crazy
people out there trying to find it so
don't mind me I ended up finally giving
a time at which wasn't that long ago and
I fell in love with it I do love it I
wear it all the time it's my shortest
Mac pencil because I've used it the most
however I do have Darvish here basically
the exact same color and I didn't
realize quite how similar they were
until I actually got soar into my
collection then I was like oh basically
I did it all along it happens so where's
the beautiful mauve color I think Kylie
Jenner is responsible for making it
popular into our Beauty community the
whole mob pink look but I'm gonna tell
you something about it I love it and the
reason I love it is because you compare
with almost any eye look and that's so
rare
you know you were nude with everything
but then you're just wearing nude and
it's just plain but sore adds a little
or Mavi pink adds a little bit of color
into your looks you're not having a
plain look but yet you match every
eyeshadow look so it's just an easy
go-to for me I love it it's beautiful
and then you have dervish which if you
can't find soar I definitely recommend
getting bearish is basically the exact
same color it may be just a little bit
deeper instead of more pink in it but
honestly if you put the two on you can't
really tell the difference like I could
put on dervish and say I'm wearing sort
a day you wouldn't be able to tell the
difference I promise you as most of us
know Mac did come out with a lot of new
liners this past week I think maybe like
two weeks ago and a lot of them are
going to actually be permanent but I
think heroin and one more not going to
be permanent so if you want those colors
girl you better go snatch them up to day
go get them now I did pick up one that
will be permanent this is Rosie rim
which this lip liner works really well
with the color please need my Mac which
is just one of those famous pink generic
colors by Mac um I did feature it might
do video if you guys want to know dupes
for MAC lipsticks I did a full video I
think it did six different MAC lipsticks
that were popular colors and I found
perfect dupes for all so definitely
check out that video please me and Rosie
Ram they go together I'm wearing Rosie
room right now your pink pink pink it is
beautiful for springtime and that's what
I'm starting to wearing it and because
today is Valentine's Day honey
chocolates I'm so off subject today okay
Rosie Ram is just a beautiful pink color
it's a staple pink color so it's the
color please me that should be in every
beautiful girls collection like yours
yep next we'll talk some darker lip
liners as to that look whoops not that
one add to that look almost okay they
look identical but sometimes mag makes
the color tips of their pencil not true
to the color that actually comes out of
the pencil I'm not trying to hate but it
is true and whenever you try to pick out
a lip liner online is definitely not
true to the actual color that you
getting and that drives me crazy
add to brown lip liners that are amazing
paired underneath lipsticks if you want
to have like that darker faded ombre
effect on your lips these lip liners are
exactly what you need to create that
have quark which is a little bit of a
lighter brown color which works well
under pinks it or mati pinks even works
well under soar and just any bobby pink
lipstick that you having you want to
give it that dark ombre effect
definitely go with cork and then if you
want to do like maroon lipstick or red
lipstick definitely go with chestnut and
apply this underneath the lipsticks on
the corner of the lips and you will
definitely get that more ombre effect
I don't think cork would work that well
with a deeper color because it's such a
light brown I don't think it was show up
enough for it to make a difference but
that's whenever you would go to chestnut
so if you want more mathy pinks and you
want to create that ombre effect get
cork if you want more reds and deeper
colors you want to create that effect
get chestnut the next two I have to talk
to you I are just like plain bold colors
I have cherry by Mac which is just a
magnificent blue toned red color and
what I've always loved to do is pair
cherry and chestnut by Mac and fill in
the whole lip and you have this
beautiful ombre effect lip it is so
gorgeous I can't get enough of it I've
been wearing that combo forever Keaney
Johnson actually posted a video on the
perfect red lip a really long time ago
and she's cherry and chestnut and I was
like yes girl yeah we are on the same
page here okay just beautiful
gotta have it I'm in love cherry and
chestnut they're like boyfriend and
girlfriend
they're like Rachel and Ross let's stay
together in Hollywood no one said oh we
got okay if you don't that you can
simply fill in your lip with cherry or
you can use it as your lip liner with
any blue tone bright red lipstick which
you just about any blue tone bright red
lipstick you put on your lips you're
going to need a lip liner go with it
pick cherry this balm but in their new
line of lip liners they came out with
they did come out with the match Ruby
woo perfectly um here over the name of
it I was like I'm not gonna get it
because I have cherry and I don't need
like eight red lip liners okay next and
last lip liner I want to talk to you
guys about is night moth which is good
with cyber the lipstick cyber which I
had a
or that video - but nine mas is that
deep plum color this is a bold color
this is a brave color this is not an
everyday color it is just one of those
lip colors it's just like wham bam hello
I'm here I love this lip color I think
it's a statement one I'd like to fill up
my whole lips with night mom as do I
like to fill them a whole lips full
majority of these lip liners I just
think they're awesome with that Mac Mac
