excited today because I have another
nuke to do for you I recently did a Mac
haul and I bought a lot of new lipsticks
and a lot of you guys were like who are
you killing our bank account okay okay
the lipsticks they're fabulous and it
inspired me doing another new video I've
already done one Deut video I'll link it
down below with all MAC lipsticks and it
inspired me to really do my research
into another new video for you guys
mostly with the lipsticks that I just
bought so I have found five new dupes
for Mac and just know my dupes are on
point okay
yeah girl I'm really excited to share
these with you I mean they're so close
that it's scary I don't know why it's
scary but it is before we start this
video I'm gonna go ahead and let you
know that my lip color is pinky promise
by Disick collar it's a matte lipstick
every time I wear this color in a video
like a lot of people asked me what lip
color I wearing and even if I put in the
description box people still ask me so I
thought I would just cover in the
beginning of the video and then that's
out of the way if you are interested in
seeing all the new dupes that I have
found well then just keep watching
start off with I have found the absolute
perfect dupe for snob by Mac just a
light pink color it's a pretty basic
color so to be honest with you it wasn't
very hard to find a dupe for it but I
did find in an exact match all right
Zack match is mat blissful by Milani is
their matte lipstick collection and they
pretty much look the same in the tube so
it wasn't really hard to find and then
when I put them on my lips the color
transfer was the exact same so it's very
impressed this one is definitely big
savings because this Milani lipstick
here it's super cheap and in the United
States MAC lipsticks run $15 a piece
fifteen to sixteen dollars a piece if
you do have Milani in your country I
know you don't in the UK I am so sorry
about that don't hate me okay
blissful and snob they're the same color
girlfriend so yeah it's a great thing
about how crooked bottom teeth you can
make it's tremely
ugly faces with your bottom teeth next
dip then I found out I do for a honey
love which this is another one that I
mentioned in my haul video and this is
another one that was really easy to find
a dupe for this is a brown tone nude
color it's a really beautiful nude color
but cookie by colour-pop cosmetics which
is only five dollars so I mean there's a
$10 difference there is the exact exact
exact same color like Hello already have
cookie well then you already have honey
love and you don't need to go spend your
money on it save yo Dallas
honey booboo child shouldn't use her as
a reference for anything but I just did
she sent stiff don't look at it it'll
fall again actually found a dupe for the
mineralized lip color this one is lady
at play which is this the ultimate
summer lip color
okay it's like a didn't smell like
anything
the gorgeous lip color I've actually had
this color for quite a while and I loved
it so much and the thing I love about
the mineralized lip color so much color
payoffs amazing they're so moisturizing
to your lips they just glide on and it's
very heavenly I'm looking for a Duke
board I immediately went over to the
high voltage lipsticks from NYX because
they have the exact same texture very
smooth very creamy they're high shine
but and I found the perfect for it
this one is in never even read the name
it's just like you are the dupe so
rags-to-riches
these two are BFFs they are the exact
same color they're the perfect dupes
they even feel the exact same whenever
you put them on your lips so what more
could you ask for
ladies believe they sell these at Ulta
and of course they sell them on NYX
website so lady at play rags-to-riches
they're the same color they're nude that
I found I don't think that I did this
one in my last video I think I did myth
this one has come - nude by Mac I've had
this lip soup for a really long time and
when I show you it it has seen better
days I used to wear this lip color I
just like spit everywhere so luckily
this is my lipstick because I just spit
all over at you I used to wear this
color to death I just loved it a cream
sheen so it's super creamy lip color
high gloss high shine I mean I haven't
been wearing it nearly as much lately
because I am more of a matte lipstick
girl lately rather than the shine
personally but it does feel really good
on lips it's just like a really really
blank out nude color cuz it is a high
shine I immediately went over to my high
voltages lipsticks by NYX Mirage is the
perfect dupe for it again Mirage it has
the same texture it transfers the same
color and it is a high shine creamy
lipstick so it's definitely just that
same formula of lipstick the exact same
color
astly i found an amazing dupe for
relentlessly red i saved it for last
because I'm most excited about it and
that makes absolutely no sense but you
know I don't make much sense so well my
hair is gonna get in that candle what we
do my hair burst in flames on camera I
would be YouTube famous for like a day
the best the bomb com ever but the only
thing is this one's more matte and this
one isn't necessarily matte relentlessly
red is a beautiful like I described it
in my last video it's so pink that it's
starting to turn red a subscriber
comments down below is that we like to
describe it as a deep watermelon color
so if you will
deep watermelon very beautiful color
again perfect for summertime
this one is covergirl 300 garnet flame
and holy crud like you can see from back
here with you they're the exact same
color this one again is a deep
watermelon it's so pink that it's
starting to look red beautiful red color
but however it has a very slight shine
to it it's definitely not a high gloss
but whenever you put it on you can see a
little bit of a shine and then with
we're little ously red you don't really
see that shine so what I did is I
applied a little bit of a translucent
powder on top of the covergirl one and
it turned matte and then there you have
your perfect dupe there dupes anyways I
just like whenever I do a dupe video for
the texture and the actual formula to
pretty much be the same but anyway so
there you have it that is my five dupes
I will continue to do these videos if
you want me to so just give me a thumbs
up if you want me to keep doing tips
videos if you're enjoying them I know
you guys enjoyed my last one so I hope
you like that is all happy guys in this
