Mac Duke video I just want to let you
guys know this morning I spent hours I
poured out all of my drugstore lipsticks
I pulled out all my MAC lipsticks and I
spent forever just comparing them
swatching them until I came up with the
ultimate perfect dupes and a lot of
these dudes are super super cheap let's
see how many did I do I came up with 6
Dukes out of my whole collection and I'm
so excited with the lot of these dupes
or super popular colors I am just
excited to share this with you I worked
really hard on pairing these together
and they just came out so perfectly they
the dupes that I found it was just like
perfect which is really hard to do and I
didn't realize how hard it was to do to
create that perfect mac lipstick install
until I got into the investigation of it
all and then I was like this is not easy
can't wait to share it with you so if
you're interested and finding your Mac
tube well then please just keep watching
the first dupe we'll start with is a
popular one by Mac we have myth by Mac
which is just that ultimate white out
nude color I love myth Adam Osler love
pairing it with different lipsticks the
dupe that I found for it is NYX new high
voltage lipstick and this one is in
Mirage these are just absolutely
beautiful they have the same texture
they look identical like you cannot beat
it and I just want to know these NYX
high voltage lipsticks are just
absolutely astonishing like they are
beautiful they're creamy and they are so
pigmented so you get the quality of a
matte lipstick with these new high
voltage lipsticks too but these two are
the exact same shade they are the exact
same texture you cannot beat it so if
you're looking for a nude a wideout just
super nude colors your Mirage by NYX
moving right along
I just got Cosmo recently I featured
this one in my IMATS haul and this is
just the beautiful Bobby deeper
in color and so what I found that
mattress this is a super super duper
cheap one this is by Jordana cosmetics
is their brand-new lipsticks for spring
2015 you can find them at Walgreens this
one is in the color mad at bear this is
o one and they are identical and what's
funny is they don't exactly look
identical in the packaging but once you
put it on your lips or you swatch it on
your hand you can't tell the difference
and another thing I have a lot of
trouble with with fighting matches is I
would have like a gloss and a matte and
that would be the exact same color but
different textures melt I know we have
to find the perfect this is another one
that's just an absolutely perfect dupe
and I will tell you cosmos a pretty
popular color so the secret's out matt
baer
is its dupe today did it did it do did
it did it did it did it do next is a
deeper darker color and this is cyber by
Mac actually does tutorial using cyber a
long time ago or it was like a fall to
toriel cyber is so bold and so dark but
is so beautiful I love it it's a very
unique color and I felt a dupe for it
dupe for cyber is Dalia this is another
high-voltage lipstick they have the
exact same texture this is a satin so it
has like that shiny finish as well does
this high-voltage lipstick by NYX oh my
gosh they are the exact same and
honestly this one is a little bit more
creamy than the Mac one don't tell
anyone I said that it's much more creamy
and I really love this color if you're
looking for that dark vamp bold lip
don't spend a lot of money on something
you're not going to wear everyday
go get your high voltage and Dalia oh
I'm really excited about this one guys
because I didn't think I would be able
to find a dupe for it and I did okay
this is kind of sexy this is a matte
lipstick matted matte lipstick or people
get upset at me this is matte and it is
beautiful it is a brown Tom la vie pink
color though I love this lipstick so
much I got this one at I'm at la too but
I have been wearing it non-stop since I
got it
I found a dupe for it obviously that's
why I'm talking about it in this video
this is bear a tall by went wild yes I
did I found a
99 doop for $15 lipstick that's a $13
savings people well do cannot beat that
you cannot find a cheaper dupe I don't
believe so bear it all by wet and wild I
do get these at Target and it is
identical to taina sexy which is another
popular color by Mac you need this color
in your life this is one of those colors
I personally think would look good on
anyone whether you have really dark
olive a skin tone or an ivory skin tone
kind of sexy is just so freaking
beautiful it's mind blowing and so now
all you need is bear it all in your life
and spend a dollar 99 and you'll just be
like yes I know how to spend my money
bear doll see exact same color that's
all I have to say about that have
another puppies in one I did find dupes
for really popular colors which it's
really surprised to do please me this is
another matte this one has been around a
fall
Etha by Mac this used to be like my
color and then I fade it off from
wearing a lot of Pink's but this is a
beautiful color it's just a matte
perfect not too hot pink not too light
pink not too dark pink it's just that
perfect medium pink color and it's dupe
is another Jordanian lipstick this is
again their spring 2015 collection matte
T's is the dupe for it so they actually
look just alike to in the packaging so
whenever I held them up I was like yo
found that stoop and whenever i swatched
it I was like Laura you are a dupe
goddess match so well like I got so
excited you guys whenever I was trying
to do that match perfectly I just like
scorched these are just like immaculate
dupes with one another and like I said I
mean they even look the same what are
you gonna do you're gonna spend your
money 15 are you gonna spin I don't know
how much these are yet but the little
Jourdain on ones yet but I'll find out
for ya last but not least it's a very
color that's dear to my heart I normally
wear this color of my birthday every
year because I want to be poppin this is
candy yum-yum by Mac my 11 year old
niece got this for Valentine's Day last
year as she spoke mm-hmm Barbie pink
that's all I'd say about it it Barbie
was to come to life she would wear candy
yum-yum every day
I found a dupe and as a Milani is
another new spring 2015 is from their
new line this is Matt Deva so this one
is a matte as well so same texture same
lip color Zac same quality the same
pigment they're the exact same color and
honestly this pig looks like just a
touch bit different like this one looks
a little bit more hot pink once I put
him on my lips I couldn't tell the
difference and what's so funny is when I
was doing the close-up of the lips I
would have to say which color I was
doing the close-up of because you
couldn't tell like so that went that way
when I go back through the footage I'd
be able to tell which was what and all
so I would like be like this is candy
yum-yum show my lips and then I'd be
like this is this color so it looks good
you can tell the difference as you can
see I'm so excited right now
they're beautiful this is my birthday
lip color that is all for my dupes
um I might do like another video with
dupes maybe like um like other makeup
