about today's video and I normally don't
put those videos on Saturday but here we
are because I got in the MU Mac wash and
dry collection and I'll obviously how to
share it with you guys
I am so excited and if I didn't film it
today like it just wouldn't good film so
I had to give this video up but anyways
oh my gosh this is Mac summer special
edition or special limited edition
collection for the summertime
I remember last year for the aquatic
collection I was in New York and I had
to like fight people in the store in New
York to get my stuff who is here with
much better actually just lost an entire
night's sleep to get it no big deal
literally set my alarm for every single
hour and woke up and it finally went
live like it's six o'clock PST time oh
the next day was rough I probably got
the collection I got a lot of big
collection too because I want to just
share it with you guys and I kind of
want it you guys say really gonna see it
it does come in stores the 21st so you
know you get your elbows out ladies and
get ready to fight for something up but
wash and dry collection can we just
start saying like what a creative name
for a makeup collection and what does
that have to do with the price of tea in
China
huh I'm sure someone will come up with
something good in the comments and let
me know like where they were going with
that but I don't know you're excited
about this just like I am give this
video a thumbs up and we're gonna get
started
I'm gonna start off with the bronzers I
did end up getting both of the bronzers
and what's so funny is I ordered it so
fast I didn't think that I got either of
the bronzers
but then I got boats I was like what is
happening right now first one is matte
bronze this packaging is just to die for
really really really what am I supposed
to do with this is beautiful
can't use it okay just kidding I'm gonna
use it this is matte bronze which
actually appears to be a pretty warm
tone deeper bronze color and I think
it's gonna be absolutely perfect for
summertime I don't know about you guys
but I totally use my limited edition
makeup so I've used matte bronzers
before and I expect it to pretty much
fill and work the same my god look at my
hand it's already squashed up now what
it doesn't come off
like like you're really gonna have to
work it off but some products are so
compacted that you have to get that
first layer off and then they start
working really well I'm hoping that's
what's going on right now but it's not
really coming off I think it's just
really compacted and you just gotta kind
of get past that first layer and dig
down into it and then you get to the
good stuff we're fine golden oh my god
I'm excited packaging the exact same
okay now this is one to be excited about
this one it looks the exact same color
but it has little golden sparkles all
over it I cannot wait to see what this
is gonna look like okay this one is so
much softer too it's weird and it's way
more pigmented oh wow
okay like this one way out does that one
it does totally and I'm the the little
light gold sparkles are so fine-grained
that I think you're not really gonna
have glitter on your face it's just like
gives it a golden hue my favorite
bronzer is refine golden next let's talk
lipstick I got two of their lipsticks
from the line the first one I got is
tumble dry okay now this is what it's
just like limited addiction like
addiction that's right Limited addiction
is correct it shouldn't be called
limited edition like say your thing okay
coleye this is honestly right on my
alley this is something I would wear
like on the regular during the
summertime I love little coral colors
like this so this one is a luster it
doesn't show up for real Perl like this
is me doing like a crap ton of swatches
of it like just back and forth back and
forth and I mean it is a luster so but I
mean is
it's very sheer color so it's hoping
able to be a little bit more pigmented
than this so it's a very sheer light
coral color and probably more people
would wear it because it is sheer but I
like that pop of color I also got steam
heat another one I'm really excited
about I mean I'm excited all the whole
collection let's be real but steam heat
is Eau de Vie Boheme red blue yes this
one's a satin oh yeah okay see now
that's what I'm talking about now we're
cooking with grease look at that color
holy cow pigmentation so this one is a
very powerful beautiful red color I
think I don't have enough Reds in my
life here's another one but I mean the
packaging is just to die for so gotta
have it gotta have it I got three of the
lip glosses and our lip laughs excuse my
French lip glass so this one is girl on
board it's the first one that I got I
think they did a heck of a job
just making the lids of them the most
beautiful you know shim dig so this one
is like white for like a better word so
I think it's gonna be just like a clear
lip laughs oh no it's white so this is
actually pretty white look from all the
way back here look how far away you are
from me yeah
you're far away you can see how white
that is from all the way back here
they're actually getting the white lip
color help care don't know how I feel or
what I'm thinking about that like how I
could incorporate that to make it work I
just lost my voice and it is due to over
excitement okay
domestic diva I feel like I'm a domestic
diva okay hello beautiful
alright so now we have a sparkly Barbie
doll pink color oh this one and it of
course this one shows up as sparkly pink
so you're really getting that color
payoff with these lip glasses which is a
normal thing format but you know so I
definitely think if you're a pink girl
domestic diva maybe your new best friend
next one is called laundry list this is
like a nice Coralie color as well
perfect for summertime and it's just
gonna be beautifully pigmented at
lately abso-freakin'-lutely okay
obsessed literally life right here yes I
urge you to get out of your comfort zone
with lip colors and wear something V
ba-boom lip colors wash off people oh my
goodness but two of the little mini
eyeshadow palettes and the first one is
green clean which is the one that I'm
most excited about and again they rocked
it out with the packaging like they went
all out yeah okay green clean really
beautiful now these are to me they're a
little bit expensive for like the small
amount of eyeshadow that you get I've
always thought that with the limited
edition eyeshadows and they kind of
surprised I got a neutral one but I was
like no girl we got it we had to get
some color so I got the green one and
we're just gonna swatch so I can see oh
holy crap pigmented eyeball
limited-edition collections from that
before and they just like the color just
turn out to be crap so but not these not
at all the first one is just pure
glitter but the other two like holy
pigment so this one is just like glitter
and then you actually have green in a
darker green pigment they're all three
super super shimmery the next one is
warm wash I don't know why I couldn't
read that the next one is warm wash same
packaging it's adorable oh my god it's
so pretty this one has like gold copper
and then it looks like it has the exact
same so maybe it's like a pinky glittery
color that one's like a greeny glittery
color but these shades are perfect for
summertime to give your eyes some
sparkle it's warming up it's time to
have some fun with our makeup and again
it costs a lot with a little bit amount
of color that you give it so pretty to
be very real with you guys with the warm
wash won all three colors come off it's
just like almost pure glitter rather
than an eyeshadow so you're not gonna
get actually that much color out of
these out of the warm wash collection
one you're gonna get just more so
colorful glitter that could still
incorporate that but for those of you
who want to use something on the regular
I don't think this is gonna be your
friend then I got two
the blushes yes the first one that I got
is Hypnose I'm digging that name Kipnis
all the packaging on camera it looks
like a light pink but in person it's
looking more like a curly beautiful
pop-up paint they're just as pigmented
and beautiful as any mac blush just as
to your heart content and as I mentioned
before my blushes they last long there
are really long wearing blushes so then
I got crisp white I'm diggin these names
like they all have to do with laundry
and that's just really original so I
like it I like it Mac I'm diggin it
mm-hmm yeah Chris White is a very light
peachy color so this is definitely gonna
lighten up your cheeks but I think it's
a unique color because any peach color
that I have in a blush is just like
peach very toned down peach so I like it
I can see where they're going with this
for the summertime I put these swatches
in the crease of my arms when I bend my
arm it's like going up right here and
sticking the lip glass ow
if the blush is a yes for sure I'm
testing this stuff out like as if I've
never used a matte blush before but I'm
testing the stuff out because sometimes
whenever you get a limited edition
collection the formula seems to be a
little bit different the blushes the
same alright guys that is it for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
hope it helped you pick out what items
you guys are gonna want to get whenever
