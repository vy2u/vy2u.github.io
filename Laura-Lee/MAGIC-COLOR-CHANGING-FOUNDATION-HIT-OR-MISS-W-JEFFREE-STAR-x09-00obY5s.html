thank you for so much love on our

that I feel good I know I only royalties
from the in Manning's videos you know we
have a check coming in at the
thank you we don't know what's gonna
happen today but Laura called me and
what are you telling me that where you
can do well I told you that today we're
going to be trying a CC cream that
transforms to your skin color so it's a
magical changing CC cream and it's at
Sephora so I'm really excited to try it
out okay so it's basically like a light
foundation and okay that's weird
it's just like adapt to your skin color
so I brought the shades ghostly white
and then do any great
this one says Claire which basically
means ghostly white yes and summer is
winding down I'm still pale nothing's
changed here I haven't been in the Sun
all summer
clearly this CC cream is Korean and it
has sunscreen in it and it says to be a
radiant face cream high definition
radiant face cream okay now I heard that
this comes out white and it changes on
your skin when the makeup hits the air
yeah once it's out of the bottle or
where they come in I like a little cute
okay so obviously you guys have seen the
unicorn it looks like this kind of color
shifting yeah it says another brand is
called err Borean yeah a Korean skin
therapist aside the airborne something
in your life or like a disease that
might go airborne and kill the whole
nation or that okay so basically this
has 1.5 fluid ounces it's not bad
actually it's pretty damn good more than
a normal foundation exactly it was 44
bucks oh yeah so it's kind of pricey no
I've never heard of this brand I know
it's on sephora.com
haven't really heard of it either other
than this it said it was exclusive to
Sephora never heard of the brand before
can't wait to try it out so what is this
going to do to my face it's going to
help boost radiance protect hydrate also
while helping to unify and camouflage
dehydration fine lines refine the
appearance of skins texture Jesus water
the definition of dehydrated right here
the definition of radiant
behind the cake okay so we're gonna see
if it's actually worked
I'm scared I think we should go in so I
read the directions online annotation
you should buy we're going to what put
on my neck a lot of people film me
I know you did we're going to priority
there our hands or like a beauty sponge
me I want primer that was in my lemare
in my lemon
okay wait that's a question I can't wait
that's a question that I bring a primer
oh it didn't say anything about it you
think about online but I feel like we
should because I was gonna pry mom
before anything it's more like a
actually you have a Nuala marijuana I
just want to use that's a mattifying one
though was it oh this is one yeah it's a
limp
alright I love this primer me to meet
that new love of mine yeah unicorn tears
I'm obsessed with their Sally Holly

actually have two bottles oh well then
I'll just try this one
monkey shake wrap that sounds so nasty
in there we it does yes sounds good
I want to hear it again though I'm
closing it on let's see if the
microphone can pick up the noise yeah is
it sound like it sounds like a letter
shaking I know the smells like smells
good
hold on no this alright let's apply out
we're blending I'm not doing this today
Geoffrey I'm also good yeah it does
honestly I can wait for it huh looks
like okay
looks like moisturizers dripping down my
no it was like a partisan it's like okay
I am I feeling kinda hit it I feel tacky
yeah I'm feeling really tacky yeah good
my face is normal especially when you
press didn't leave it leave it a
fingerprint like foam and it may look
like memory but a bad look was Scylla
colleges
haha hey forever in a boat accident or
you can't swim just grab onto my
forehead
it's a buoy okay let's get to the review
shall we try it out
High Definition radiance cream hold on I
want it I wanted to know what the forest
is real quick after four weeks of use
91% of people felt that this game was
more beautiful how do I know it that's
who measures what beautiful is yeah so
this is going to solve uneven skin tones
dullness and I need an texture a skin
perfecting cream with two color matching
shades girl that's a little you should
have made more shape yeah there's a
night a shade and that's it really does
it down yeah oh that's true were idiots
we'll turn it up somehow I may be right
but it's not about some most skin tones
it feels like toothpaste coming out yeah
almost right Oh is speckle whoa it looks
like a little beads in there enough okay
I'm right here I'm just gonna put a
bunch out there ow my wrist that's an
effort okay so white it's white
oh boy toothpaste we are that looks the
same how is it different shades maybe
because it's going to change in a second
alright let's see if this works I'm
scared let's do half our face like let's
just see what happens why do our is it
right there
karma we're being so mean to me all the
time
yeah okay so how we're gonna play I'm
going to use this little oh so thick
whole like this paste or something okay
I'm going to just take this on my brush
you're using your fingers look at that
uh-huh oh my god it's like Colgate bitch
yeah girl I think it seems I look I just
did half my face I just Amanda side oh
yeah idiot yeah you guys already knew
that okay so let's try Bundy it smells
like Avon so the next time screen okay
here we go
look at that look it's turning into my
skin color no well who yeah my god yeah
it is I'm not kidding I'm freaking out
Wow look at that
what am i doing nothing
oh great let me do this I swear my
fingers made it yeah it is look right
here if you can see it now Oh a little
book it's turning all my skin turning on
my skin holy shit turn color okay hold
on hold on to that holy hook this is not
gimmicky is it uh-huh I might have a
gimmick y'all might be into business it
might be into real business this is so
weird
it's so weird this is so incredibly pink
though am i big why where you Lilly on
things you see the pinky yeah they need
me like a yellow tone one I am more on
the pinky tone though yeah so it
probably works great for you can tell
was in my cheek look how pink oh wow
yeah I'm not hating it no wait it's
crazy out there
earning like I just recognized but look
at the difference I didn't really do it
here yet let's see like oh wow it looks
really this is a trip you guys okay like
a shapeshifter off of the True Blood
mm-hmm like alien versus Predator me
Burnage you owe Pam Baldemar okay okay
come on slither in it I don't know if
you guys can tell on camera but I just
feel like I'm so pink
compared to my whoa oh yeah like really
like really pinky okay this actually
adapted to my skin and I'm kind of
freaking out it actually looks so pouty
and I feel like it looks a little bit
weird on me just because the skin tone
but it's not the end of the world
and I do feel like I look a little Oh me
like a little glow yeah like it hit me
it does give you a little bit of the
monosomy I want a little bit more Oh
I'll cover my hair
oh my god Laura oh my god here's some
white this Laura was trying out a new
conditioner all right so let's try our
neck a little bit we're going to go in
so I think you're looking really pretty
because and with supply given I can't
yeah it's really bizarre I kind of like
how this looks on the swish I look like
this but I'm never going
fun no you're not okay so it's playing
on my neg I like it it does
I feel like bran that's kind of tripping
me out yeah I like it a lot I feel like
it works better with a brush in through
your fingers because it's a little bit
difficult to get the call is it
distribute differently would you use a
brush it doesn't so quick yeah it almost
looks like you're really bronzy it's
weird yeah I don't like in love with it
mmm the pinky is not the end of the
world I will say like overall looks good
but once you put it against my skin it's
a little weird but I feel like once I
got a blender out it's not as weird had
a dog here my mouth so I think it's not
a gimmick ah
I'm wearing my mouth why see that let me
see you breathe out you just inhaled it
you Lillian helmet it went in it sucked
it for 100k so how do we like is a set
is it dry down how do I look feel sticky
sticky oh yeah I'm just like your daily
moisturizer I almost want to put on my
concealer in pounds so I feel like
they're trying to advertise it like a
daily moisturizer but if you guys can
see cool
I'm loving the key and sealy change whoa
that is such a trend that great I almost
want to try to go dab a concealer okay
in a little powder and let's just see
what happens like how I wear the new
products yeah I think we should me maybe
Nikki are you the shade
I mean this concealer is full coverage
so we're gonna get the full coverage
experience here look at that shit just
look at the lifted that is girl without
the Golden Girls she's feeling like
fucking Betty White miss thing I'm like
my nose already looks contoured look in
the monitor like what are ya except that
stuff was so dark whoa the concealer
actually looks pretty good over it I
will say that yeah my concealer I did
too I added too much of it really
because you've never used it you are oh
you're good but it isn't like hair
bounce that was Emma and it looks a
little bra
it's just foundation here's a clean line
just bounces yeah I've been tested
actually like this CC cream I think so
okay here's the thing as I really don't
like CC creams at all I hate
think I hate you can saying a word it's
like actually annoying
c-synch rain what stupid but I'm not
minding it so I'm going to go ahead and
set it just because it feels a little
oversized no we're using the mayor baby
girl
oh why Laura the little white baby yeah
why don't I come over here every time
you think I really like how this looks
like I'm kind of shocked yeah because
everybody stay away from anything like
that exist I don't really wear a baby or
safety if I was going to do something
like that I would just like to wear
lightweight foundation mm-hm
you know it's crazy right now Laura
right now we're in Bora Bora um
sickening come on family vacation
alright so we added a little bit of
bronzer concealer powder just to finish
home you would out yet a black brush
hair in the white hair here now you have
on your own here in your eye what is
going on with us so we're just has a bug
in hair you bitches at me okay something
that lemon if they right now I'm a
little shocked that I normally are into
this type of thing yeah first of all
work and second of all is the way
thicker consistency than anything I've
ever use so I like that same it says
lightweight but like it's not
lightweight though I wouldn't say or
like um lightweight and light coverage
and it sounds like it covered more than
I yeah thought pigment and it has a
little bit of coverage which you only
know covers from a CC cream or BB cream
yes very very minimal with this I'm like
oh my god I felt a difference your skin
looks so radiant love it my only
critique would be like it's so pink 2ne1
yellow tone you're definitely going to
see that difference on your skin you
know I think they share a few more
shades even though you know it's agree
it even though it's color changes yeah
it's not going to work for everybody
there might be a few more shades but
they'll just pretty much my only
critiques I really like the rock scene
I'm like kind of shocked I'm like oh my
god I'm going to bring out our trip and
try it out I think I bring one too and
there's a lot of product here I can't
imagine last a long time you get more
than a regular foundation yeah and it's
so thick yeah we use a little dollop
diamond quarter size by the quarter yeah
so it would take us a long time to
go through this yeah and I have a big
fuckin taste so maybe short Detroit for
me but no one cares about your world as
we're all on the packaging so I just
don't anything I wasn't going to show
off my limited-edition Sephora packaging
available in stores now so I guess
that's it for this video
