I'm always excited about videos but also
because I'm going to see logic and
concert tonight I'm going to get ready
after I finished filming and we're gonna
go Club Semak hey guys welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be a
tested out type of video when we trying
out some magic makeup I was up volta and
I found lipstick queen color-changing
makeup and I'm super excited about it I
also did some research on YouTube
installed my girlfriend talk tea also
known as glam life guru did a video
testing this out so I thought what the
hell I'm gonna try it out too and I also
found this blue one it's crazy I don't
even know if it works we're gonna try it
out I'm excited about it like I'm real
excited about it and also so many people
in the comments Ben asked me where I get
this mirror from is from impressions
vanity and I have a discount code it's
in the description box I'll link it that
way you guys will know where it's from
and all that I just get a lot of
questions about my background cuz it is
fabulous
I'm excited about today's video I
haven't like tested out makeup and alone
actually I did I did just do a first
impressions video anyways that's why I'm
not wearing any lip color right now um
because I'm gonna be trying out some
some sleep um worm if you haven't
subscribed to my channel be sure and
subscribe
Dubey okay okay okay alright let me
night cool okay let's do this let's jump
right in and get started I guess how to
do this I could steal the packaging I
mean even taking it out of the packaging
I haven't even washed this stuff like
we're learning about this together I
feel like we should try the blue first
it's a gloss I know that and again the
brain is lipstick Queen who's creating
this stuff and this is a blue gloss is
supposed to turn into a Maki pink Cup
it's supposed to turn it into a Mabi
pink color and it's kind of weird
because you can see the little doe foot
applicator pink in there this is called
Hello Sailor
lipgloss cycler don't you live how say
that's a country and I'm just literally
going to apply it to my lips and find
out if it works you see how the product
is blue on the one but yet the one is
pink
okay applying it
it turns out to be quite a sheer blue
but definitely blue it looks like
purpley blue as far as the gloss the
gloss feels nice it's not gooey or icky
all right so I applied a fat layer of it
onto my lips and so far it's not
changing pink it's still like it's like
a sheer blue color but I wonder how long
I have to wait is there any instructions
y'all know I don't read instructions how
to jump right in and get started
it doesn't say there's no instructions
not be read online while we wait it is
154 right now so let's see how long it
takes to change colors it really acts
with the warmth of your lips mmm my lips
you can see the sides I still blue hue
to them but they are turning I don't
know I still see like a purpley blue to
them let's see what time it is
it is 157 we are three minutes in deep
and we're still kind of blue but I think
it's turning pinkish alright so I moved
up a little bit and wow it is
transforming a little bit but it's so
sheer that I can see like a blue hue
like in the corner I'm out but my actual
lips are turning a little bit of a mommy
pink it's not much pigment so it's not
like a crazy transformation um I
honestly thought it was gonna be like
whoa
pink like I don't know it's not as cool
as I thought it would be hmm but while
we're waiting for it to turn even more
pink and maybe it will I don't know if
it will we're going to be trying out the
lipstick Queen they have a cream blush
this one's called frog print so maybe
this one will be cooler because it is a
green that's supposed to turn into a
pink I'm scared I'm not going to lie I'm
going to take my foundation brush and
just swipe across my cheek and get any
of that blush off this is what it looks
like and I'm just going to apply it with
my fingers which is typically how I
apply a cream blush okay oh my gosh it's
already pink look at that that's Christ
this is way cooler than the lip product
oh my gosh so obviously this transforms
paint Wow look at that that is so cool
you see that he would pink that's really
pretty oh my god that is so cool
had to thumbs up for the blush the blush
is amazing that was like the quickest
transformation like as soon as I touched
it look at this bear finger swipe see it
turning more pink that's so dope blush
was a definite win the lips did turn ma
be pink it just wasn't as much of like a
wow blue to pink I thought it would be
the blush was definitely more of like a
wham bam factor crazy transformation in
color I'm really impressed with the
blush I'm kind of like holy crap my
fingers are gonna be pink for a week I
don't really know I think the lips look
as blue sparkle in them so they always
have like a little touch of blue I
actually have a lipstick not a lip gloss
but the lipstick that's in green how you
really see that my lips are still a
little bit blue you see that but let's
try out the lipstick now so this is a
green turning into a pink is called frog
prints like the other one it looks like
this in the packaging and then we open
it and it is just as green as it can be
look at that whoa ha ha I just watched
it all over my hand and it comes off
pink it's pretty much just like the
cream blush I definitely want to say
that the lipsticks way cooler oh you can
definitely tell it's more pink than the
gloss so sheer this is more like uh I
don't know like a butter lipstick this
doesn't even start out green at all this
just goes straight from pink to pink so
I guess it is color transformation but
you don't really see the color
transformation because immediately
whenever you swatch it or put it on its
immediately pink like it's never that
it's magical
that's magic makeup lips are really
turning pink now you can definitely tell
and then lastly I have the lipstick
queen green frog in the claw so this is
the green gloss I feel like we should
apply it on top of the lipstick what do
you think ty should I do that I think we
should apply the gloss on top of the
lipstick first and then we'll put the
gloss on on his own in the end so again
frog prints gloss it is green as can be
and now the one has a little bit of pink
in it but I mean it's super green so
yeah let's let's do a good idea so it
swatches actually green look at that
so is it gonna transform because the
other gloss didn't really transform and
a pink right there huh okay so we're
gonna take the lipstick off Elise I'm
not gonna be ill till my lips are
stained oh it is slowly but surely
turning pink but it still has quite a
bit of a green hue to it which I don't
know it's like on the regular I want
like a green hue to my lips Oh see look
huh my lips look dirty my hand isn't
really transforming much more like do
you see it just looks kind of dirty
right there I don't think I like the
glosses is it the sparkles MC okay so my
conclusion is the glosses have sparkles
in them and you can see the sparkles
because the sparkles never change so
it's like pink gloss with green sparkles
in it what I would I'd normally
personally no it's just not my style I
don't even like sparkles in my gloss
personally
I don't do ah I don't care for the
glosses the lipstick was really cool I
did kind of think it was gonna be like a
green lipstick that goes on and your
color and your lips just transformed to
pink um and it was just more like a
green in the tube and it goes on pink
still magic still color-changing then
the blush I really thought was cool it
is a stain I like the blush a lot and it
looked really pretty on and I normally
don't offer cream blushes just not
really my song makeup you know I'm
Claire I like the blush it's a cool
theory it's it's a really neat form of
makeup it is a magic makeup that's it
