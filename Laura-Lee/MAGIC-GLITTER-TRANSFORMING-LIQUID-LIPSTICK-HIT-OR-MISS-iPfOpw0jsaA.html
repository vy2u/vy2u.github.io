channel today's video we are going to be
testing out a really cool product and
we're going to find out if it's a
gimmick or not so I got these in PR they
are these to bear to see oh my god I
can't say it
they are the CIA London glitter flip so
you're supposed to put them on it's just
a normal metallic lippy it then you
press your lips together and then
magically transform into a glitter lip
there just be comfortable to wear and
they're 19 bucks and they're going to be
a Sephora on August 15 and then they're
on CIA's website this video isn't
sponsored but these were sent to me and
my opinion I don't know my opinion yet
but it will be my own whenever I figure
out whatever my opinion is I'm really
excited to try this out it says apply
dry press and pop transforming lip
comfortable smooth texture I'm supposed
to be reading this stuff in the middle
of the video and I'm reading it in the
intro so I'm just getting really ahead

okay so it is Sunday right now god knows
when this video is going to go live
because go honey John I am pre filming
stuff I've been cleaning my house all
day long and I stopped and fill in this
little Instagram tutorial and I was like
you know what I think I'm going to film
with the lippies I'm just telling you
all about my day right now and I was
like I don't know I just wanna film a
video now that I'm glam and utilize it
and talk to you guys a little bit so I'm
going to film this right now so I'm
excited so let's open all these up the
packaging is cute it's like shimmery
super fluttery really cute CIPA hoping
these a work out I got to take my lippy
off it I have on now I'm going to take
it off and I'll be right back
oh she's thirsty thirsty thirsty I want
to show you guys the precious eat so you
can kind of get what I'm seeing here
here are all the shades it comes in I
can set up three it says to apply it
push your lips together and then pop
watch it transform it's magic it's so
cool and it glitters and it dazzles now
that was easy reading instructions let
me show you the three shades I have I
have candy fortune and iconic first I
really want to try on iconic eye and
drop it I don't know why it's just like
screaming at me to try so that's what
we're going to do if we take it out it
just comes on doe foot applicator it
looks super glittery in the little
container and I'm just gonna oh what is
that
here I go first off are you effing
kidding me look how much pigmentation
huh one swipe okay see okay I see you I
just applied way too easy for such a
dark color whoa - if you can see they're
really shiny and metallic looking but
not really glittery
let me read one even coat which is what
we just did
leaving to dry for two minutes okay I'm
glad I read that before I press my lips
I kissed them together so I got my timer
and I've had it on probably 30 seconds
so let's just hang out and chill for two
minutes you can do this dance to
distract us okay it's been on for two
minutes it feels like it's dried are we
ready we're going to smack our lips
together
Oh freaking magic I'm dying over here it
was pretty cool
like my husband just watch this happen
oh my gosh what the hell just happened I
am freaking out right now let me have
this moment we have a magical product on
our hands and I'm living for it mmm the
more you do it the more glittery a good
girl it's magic do you see how the more
I do it the more glitter comes out I've
never been so shook it in my life I
don't think Michael and it's so cool
looking okay so sad that I have to take
this off right now huh
well in other news we're going to try
out the other colors because I'm kind of
dying over this okay let's try out the
shade fortune which is purpley okay she
doesn't know how to apply lip product
can we just pretend that this is a
little bit more even because I'm just
having a struggle moment right now with
these it feels like it's drying pretty
nicely whenever they are glittery they
still just slightly more drying when
nothing crazy or nothing that I can't
wear these are really interesting we're
almost ready to do our flip I'm really
excited about these what are you guys
thinking you definitely had to tell me
down in the comment section would you
wear these now I have some more neutral
shades I was sent this three but they
have like pink and peach and red so I
think a red glitter lip could be really
cool all right it's time let's see the
magic happen let me get close it happens
turn to glitter
oh my teeth so it definitely turned to
glitter this work too it's just so cool
I am just so interested in like how this
is happening and I think that this
purple color actually looks really
really pretty what do you guys think and
now we're going to try to pink one I
could just like stare my
you find her all day long today but we
have to move on
excuse me I'm missing all my foundation
around my mouth now I'm really
interested in candy this is a more
neutral e1 and to see if it's more or as
vibrant as the other ones test it out
and see candy doesn't even look shiny or
shimmery it kind of looks like it's
going to be matte it's easier to apply
that that goes hand-in-hand with a more
neutral color all right shall we wait
candy is just such a pretty color too
just to wear on its own it'd be kind of
funny you're like all talking someone
and they just measure with the other and
then it was like what season ma'am
love just turned into the disco ball
okay we are ready our two minutes is up
let's tuck Rome together and see what
happens it's query work mm-hmm
by the way I noticed the more you must
pucker them together and they get even
more glittery it's just too cool I'm in
shock what happened to you my experience
with a Mack roller liner everyone okay
so Marley does recommend these to you
guys oh my gosh I just think they are
the coolest thing ever I think they're
the most unique innovative thing ever I
think they look so cool on the lips are
pretty darn comfortable to wear they
apply evenly like what more can I say
and the sad thing is I was really
doubting these I was like because I did
try a stamp a lip product before that
really didn't work for me so I was kind
of like let's try these out girl they
might be a gimmick but these are no
gimmick these are non gimmick real-life
magic thing that happened and I'm so
excited about it if you want to have
some fun or you like glitter lips and
you want something magical really cool I
recommend these to you guys dadgum it so
I guess I did for this video we went
through it kind of quick my lips are so
cool
oh and their kiss proof hi so cool
