what's up guys welcome to my channel we
had a real cool bit a lot of artwork but
today's video is going to be be testing
out magic mousse so I saw this on a
Facebook ad scroll through Facebook not
minding my own business doing some
snooping and then you know how they have
like those really gimmicky ads where is
like plays like a crazy product and they
make it look like it's the best product
to the world well that's basically what
they did with this they had it like pass
motion and they had put in a not broken
product like well ban the product looks
like new so this must be a magic makeup
fixing mousse I know you can fix mousse
with alcohol I've done that before but I
thought I would try the magic make it
repair miss it says we're not promising
me either moon we're just giving it to
you Oh cocky cocky I like it alright so
basically what I want to do today is I
bought this huh my assistant put 110
dollars on it so I would remember the
price because I don't remember I bought
$110 blush I want to bust up 110 dollar
blush slash highlighter from Sicily and
see if we can repair it now I know it's
not gonna look as beautiful but uh we'll
see what we can do and I just think it
puts an interesting spin like Ken it
takes a super expensive product we'll
find out today I'm really excited trust
it should trust it out to test it out so
without further ado I'll sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and then we'll go ahead
and get sorry be sure to subscribe to my
channel before you leave subscribe game
so now we're gonna jump right into the
video
as you guys can see I've not even opened
this up let's see we have instructions
that's good mostly you'll are leaves no
I do not like to read instructions but
in this case I will it's oh we travel
238 900 oh let me try again we travel
200 we travel 230 thousand nine hundred
miles just to get to you just to get you
just to get to you because make up wow
I'm having a hard time reading okay here
we go reading isn't your thing just go
to our website for a tutorial I'm gonna
read these instructions are really
hilarious and quirky so I don't mind
reading them it says one bottle you have
a spatula a bottle the repair a square
press tool and a circular press tools
what comes with it preparing first
gather up and salvage any of the makeup
sweep it back into its container so
basically it says put your broke in make
it back into the container use a spatula
to kind of press it down shake the
mousse bottle dispenses the mousse to
cover the surface of the makeup okay so
basically step two is putting the mousse
on the makeup it says if you add too
much it'll just take longer to dry if
you add too little you can add a little
more miss later and it depends on these
sides of your product as to how much
mousse you may need once the mousse has
kind of dissolved into the makeup you
can grab your spatula mix it around to
see if you put the right amount of this
in because it should be like a paste
like substance if it's too dry it says
add another glob of the mousse don't
move on to the next step until there are
no longer lumps in the tool smooth
makeup with spatula next you're going to
use your spatula to smooth the makeup
out in the pan make it a little really
firm and pretty oh it says go to bed oh
my god am i filming this video tomorrow
too oh I didn't know I know there's
gonna be a two day video you're done for
the night but the mousse isn't done
working it's magic
so it'll dry out overnight you leave the
makeup in a safe place okay and then it
says whenever it's all dry in the
morning we will press the product again
so guess what we're gonna film tonight
it's already kind of late and then
tomorrow I'll finish the video I guess
so our next step would be the the blush
I'm gonna have a big zit and I just it
hurt okay I'm gonna take the blush
here's our hundred and ten dollar blush
packaging this is what a hundred and ten
dollar blush looks like we should swatch
it beforehand so we can see what it
looks like before I bust it up honestly
it just looks like a very light shimmery
blush and I just rubbed my finger all
over it I kind of want to put some on
just before I destroy it oh it's pretty
girl it's pretty here comes the time
that is the most fun and satisfying
we're enjoy this little bad boy right
here all right I have this little tool
oh here we go
I hope this is good enough lighting for
you guys you can see how messy my desk
is that I film on it looks like I staged
it but I did it okay here we go
oh she's crazy she's insane she's
lauralee go get in there we cannot lose
this well I'm gonna get it good and
broke in the filling I'm doing this
right now I wish you guys could do it
with me it's so satisfying I actually
went in bought this
blush for another tutorial but we're
using it in this video we're getting
down to oh okay a hundred and ten dollar
blush right there chopped to pieces that
is magnificent it says take the spatula
and kind of like put all the pieces back
in there nicely which luckily we broke
it in the container but it just says
salvage your pieces wherever it broke so
I'm gonna like pack it back in with a
little spatula okay I just want to show
you guys the two tools it comes with the
pressing circle and the pressing square
depend on the size of your product here
is the mousse it is kind of a small
bottle but I mean how much broken makeup
are you gonna be dealing with so this
should be good I gave it a good shake
and we're gonna pump some out
I do like a lot how does that look that
looks good right doesn't really tell you
how much estimations are encouraged
alright guys so I'm filming as the Moose
dissolves a little bit it's gone down
and I'm just gonna chill and take my
makeup off really quick and then come
back and see where we're but it is
dissolving pretty quickly and then we'll
see if we need to add a little bit more
minutes I just washed my face and it
appears oh girl it's real pasty the foam
is settled so now I'm gonna start
morphing this into oh it's it's real
kooky into the blush to make it
beautiful kind of smooth it out like
peanut butter like the directions said
this is not as easy as as I'm making it
look I'm not making it look that easy
was not as easy as you think
um I feel like I should just use this
guy oh yeah oh oh maybe not okay we're
learning together oh that worked I
worked really well okay I think my
finger yeah my fingers just what it's
gonna have to happen it sticks to me
well it's definitely not as pretty as
when we started
Wow so I feel like I got that really
smooth down in the pan what do you guys
think I think it looks pretty good I'm
gonna dump off that excess and then
whenever we're finished letting this dry
overnight I will come back and uh we'll
test it out and we'll also clean up the
edges though edge needs some help all
righty so we're gonna leave it alone I'm
gonna come back in the morning and
finish this video and we're gonna see
what it looks like so this is really fun
it's a little science experiment so I'm
gonna leave it open sitting right here
on my desk and I'll be back in the a.m.
all right honey bunnies I am back and
this is the next day over and I am going
to show you the product so I went ahead
and touched it it does feel completely
dry here is what it turned out like um
not the prettiest because obviously
there's no way it could go back into its
form that it would came in because I
crushed it so much but it's all put
together and it has a lot of
pigmentation I would say the same amount
of pigment that it had in the beginning
it almost feels slightly more creamy
sorry I'm six my voice is so scratchy um
I almost feel slightly more creamy than
it did before before it felt like a bate
pigment and now it feels like a creamy
blush it does have some around the sides
I'm gonna take a little makeup wipe and
clean off also I thought about something
while cleaning this off I was gonna tell
you guys so as I went on willy nilly and
started breaking it like a crazy person
I was like I mean yeah there is some
makeup that does get broken that much
until it's just powder have you guys
ever received something in the mail and
you're just like whoa this exploded in
the powder so that does happen but
typically when you drop and break your
makeup there's like one or two breaks in
it it doesn't explode into a crusty
powder like I broke this product in two
so I would I just have to say I think it
would repair it even easier and better
if your product wasn't in a million
little pieces like I did mine which I
guess I just wasn't thinking it through
but that just means we really put this
product through the test to see if it
would work so now I think what we should
do is apply two
cheeks have all my makeup on but I don't
have any blush on because obviously
we're gonna be applying this product to
La face girl where's the blush brush I
found it the e4 is the one that I always
use for my blush brush for my blush the
brush that I used my blush lotta Marcy
it's just an angled brush it's super
soft and so I'm gonna tap yeah you get a
lot of product off oh it's a really
pretty blush it looks so pretty
honestly it looks really beautiful and I
love it and it really repaired my
product even for the fact that I
literally busted this brush into a
million pieces it fixed this blush I'm
so shook I'm so happy I think this is a
great product I'm really happy about it
I really think it repaired the product
very well I'm super impressed so even a
hundred and ten dollar blush this
product can fix even if it's broken in a
million pieces
I did use a lot of foam the next broken
paint makeup ah I will fix I'll use a
little less foam like it said the
instructions are so easy like it says
just like if you use too much foam just
let it dry a little longer if you don't
use enough just add a little more so you
really can't go wrong with this product
I know that alcohol too can fix broken
makeup I've used it before but alcohol I
tried to fix an urban decay blush um and
it was like iridescent like really
shimmery and pretty one time with
alcohol and it dried out the blush and
the blush was never the same it did not
work but I know on some highlighters you
just dab some alcohol in there and bam
you're right back to normal but I really
feel like that blush looks the same
whenever I swatch it and it applies the
same if not even more creamy so I do
prefer this product over alcohol and I
mean I don't know you guys decide at
home if it's worth it to you like is it
worth it like how much makeup are you do
you really have this broken or how often
will you really be using it but anyways
goodness gracious I'm a little
anyway that is in our view I give this
product two thumbs up it's not a gimmick
most facebook ad crap God is a gimmick
and you gotta look out for it but this
product isn't a gimmick like your really
works I'm so impressed and yeah if you
got a lot of broken makeup I recommend
it to you guys thank you so much for
