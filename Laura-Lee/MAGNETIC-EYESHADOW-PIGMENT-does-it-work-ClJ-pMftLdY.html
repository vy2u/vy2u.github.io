way you're on the large annal thought I
would start introducing myself because
there's people out there who kind of my
channel they don't know who I am you
haven't subscribed to my channel be sure
and subscribe I'm telling you this
before we've been jumping to the video
so let's go ahead and talk about what
we're going to be talking about today
I'm all over the place in today's video
we're going to be talking about magnetic
eyes shadows that were sent to me
actually by MAC Cosmetics so like this
and I saw a little snippet of them on
Instagram and then they appeared in the
mill so thank you Mac for sending those
over they are not paying me to talk
about these eyeshadows it was just in a
PR package and then they sent like a
little piece of paper with it and it
tell us about them they're very cool
they're very interesting and I'm not
I've never used them so I don't even
know how they're gonna play out on my
eyes but we will be testing that out in
this video today lucky you you get to
see the Shih szu the before it
happens they're gonna be twenty two
dollars and they will come out in stores
I don't know when will they come out in
stores Oh
October 20th they come out today which
is a big ol bit of tomorrow so they came
out yesterday so they are available in
North America October the 20th and
internationally they will be available
at November 2016 so now we know I'm
really excited to try these outlets
gonna be my little does it work video
series and we're gonna jump right into
the video
because I've already talked enough to
make three intro let's jump right in
alright jumping right in I kind of want
to read this little thing really quick
to tell you like what Mac is saying this
exactly is I have blue green and like a
maroon color this is one H this is what
actual I have to learn how to read first
this is one attraction that is
impossible to resist well these are all
Spellbinder eyeshadows by the way
Spellbinder eyeshadows creates
mesmerizing eyes with the deepest most
mysterious shades plunging to the lids
clinging clinging to the lids clinging
tool is like pure velvet black Ayanna's
eyes pigments are magnetically charged
magnetically
you heard that charge fusing the loose
powder together so it magnetically
maintains is form and dimension supposed
to stay like this the weirdest thing is
I dug my finger back and forth watch me
just really getting in there the powder
puffs you out but it stays in that
ripple form in the case they are very
pigmented the blue is the least
pigmented out of all of them do you see
that whenever I swipe it it's not
actually like an insane amount of
pigment but the more maroon and green
one have more pigment than the blue I
don't know what that's about
it's just what I'm experiencing over
here I'm literally just like talking to
you guys like sometimes I try to think
before I speak like I'm like what should
I tell them they just say that so the
video makes sense but I'm just over here
like playing with them and just tell you
what my mind is thinking it's so weird
do you see how like they it's like
magnetically spewing out you can kind of
see right here how it's like splooshing
out but the magnet is like grabbing it
and keeping it into little jars I think
there's a magnet down in the bottom of
it but if you can see here that's way
more pigmented than that blue and then
I'll show you a swatch this one is
called higher power see it's like
wanting to spill out with the magnet
like tress and snatch it back in the jar
that's higher power so the bow is very
pretty I'm not I just hit my mic so I'm
sure it was like not 100% sure how to
use these it doesn't say thank you just
apply them since there's a pigment I
would just like press it onto my eyelid
I wouldn't go blending it crazy this is
anything new wouldn't work out that way
I'm going to try the green I think this
is an e 58 brush from Sigma it's a flat
synthetic brush it's a any brush that
would use on any pigment guys it's so
weird do you see how I can like rake up
a pile the color and it doesn't like
come out because there's a magnet it is
the weirdest and it's supposed to be
like stay on your eyelid I'm nervous
okay here I go
whether you're recording I'm not good to
leave yes there's a booger in my nose
the whole time there's a booger in my
nose for the whole intro I'm plying the
green and it's like I'm catching
a little bit of Fallout not that big of
a deal what if a magnet would pick up
the fallout it's so pigmented it's
almost feels like a cream like it's more
pigmented than my swatch I don't know
how that's happening but guys I know you
see this holy crap look like anywhere I
touched up here this is up so that tells
me that we are dealing with some serious
pigmentation but you know what look it
with a blending brush it's like moving
the product around a lot I got lots of
fallout but it is a pigment so that
typically happens let me add a little
more almost a low-key hard to work with
me to say a product is too pigmented is
just blasphemy so it's weird because the
pigment swept away off my face without
smudging into my skin which typically
would happen you know like you swipe it
away and it would leave streaks but it
didn't do that so that's a little
different it always wipes away into
nothing though with a blending brush
it's just weird and then with a flat
synthetic brush the pigments um they are
incredible and just to clarify I'm not
obsessing over the actual makeup look
I'm creating because I have a patchy
mess going on right there I'm just
testing out a new product for you guys
you know hanging out this is more of
like a what does it look like on my face
kind of video yeah I really want to try
out another color but I'm going to be
looking really weird in one video with
two different eyeshadow shades in my
face but we're gonna try out another
color anyways I'm gonna try out the blue
I'm trying out two different colors in
my face this videos getting cry cry okay
so here's the blue the blue is called
aphrodisiac and I'm going to just grab
the colors it stays in that shape it's
the weirdest it is the weirdest the blue
is way more pigmented way more pigmented
from the brush to the lid then from the
finger-like then a finger swatch it's
weird if these things get smushed around
they don't blend well if they get packed
on they are great so whenever I apply it
to my eye is almost like literally
applying a magnetic product a magnet to
your eye like the pigment is just like a
magnet because you press it on and it is
as you can see the most pigmented thing
I think I've ever used but if you swipe
back and forth I kinda just swishes
around it disappears so I really like
the product and I really appreciate how
innovative innovative it is I just now
that I know exactly how to use them I
feel like I could use them to the best
ability do you see how it's like almost
swiping off of my eye you just really
got to be careful with them you just got
to pack them on be gentle don't begin
crazy want to create a really cool
makeup tutorial use it on let me know if
you guys want to see that though down in
the comments whoa that blue is pigmented
so it's like if you swatch it across
your skin you just don't get the same
amount of pigmentation and then here's
the maroon it's called higher power by
the way to let you guys get a good look
at that interesting it's like a Browning
Maroons very pretty so overall my review
these are a very different innovative
product on our market as a magnetic I
shadow it works on your eyelid kind of
like a magnet if you blend it swipe it
back and forth you almost lose all your
product but if you pack it on you're
going to get the most extreme
pigmentation possible so they're not a
blendable pigment most pigments I don't
blend though I just pack them onto the
lid honestly I think it's so cool how
they stay in the package I think the
colors are very pretty I have it all
over my arms yeah for some reason this
is one of the I would say one of the
most interesting products I've ever
tried out I really like the all matte
black packaging here's what the lid
looks like I mean it's just a matte
black lid but it's all matte black
packaging of course let me know what you
think about these products down in the
comment section you know I love to hear
you guys have thoughts I just think
they're very cool a little tricky to
work with but once you get the hang of
it and you create a really beautiful
look especially with this blue it's like
screaming at me now thank you so much

sweet video but I just want to try this
