video is going to be really cool because
we're going to be testing out
holographic lippies and mmm hey you guys
how to turn any lip product like whether
it's just your lips liquid lipstick or a
lip stick into a holographic field today
we're going to be using these new
glosses they kind of just floating
around the internet a little bit and
these were sent to me in student
sponsored or anything but I saw them and
honestly I was like so amazed by oh I'm
doing the intro lab so therefore I've
already tried out all these on my lips
and I'm also going to give you guys a
little run down a review about them and
then I'll show you like in detail me
using them did figure out the best way
to get the most effective holographic
lips out of these and I will tell you
shortly
also just a heads up I'm having a super
watery eye day today do you guys ever
just happens days where your eyes are
just like girl today we're going to go
through it I'm going to water all day
and piss you off
yeah today is that day I've literally
throughout the video you see me like dab
my eyes constantly and it's because
tears are just going to pour out I gotta
get these false lashes open and this is
the end of the video anyways technically
because I'm like filming it backwards so
I love the pop all these dogs lost oh
how about this all we're supposed to pop
off these false lashes and kind of call
it a day and then I'm going to edit for
the rest of the day we're going to go
ahead and jump on in the video be sure
to subscribe to our channel for you
leave that way you don't miss out on
anything now let's get started okay I
want to give you like a really quick
mini review of these there's five of
them
really cool I don't really care for the
wand on them because it is a brush but
it's like this this is brush in the
world and it feels plastic so I'm not
obsessed with the one on them they work
best
I found out kind of dabbing it with your
finger rather than the one and they work
best with a liquid lipstick that way
your product doesn't melt into your
lipstick because I tried it with a
lipstick and you'll see you'll see all
that job and other than that the actual
consistency of the gloss I loved it I
loved it level of it it's great it's not
too thick and goopy I hate really
thinking goopy glasses they're not for
me so these aren't too thin either it's
just a perfect texture and I think it's
a really cool product and yeah we had
some success with it anyways we're going
to go ahead and jump right in to testing
these out first I'm going to test I want
to detail a graph has lips on top of my
new lip e to really show I think this is
really great example to show like how
cool it can turn out
this one's called pink lotus and it
comes with like the tiniest brush here I
got so dope oh so cool can I see like if
you like see the colors kind of change
as I swish it around it literally kind
of looks like an oil spill on my list oh
the one on it is like a plastic stick is
actually a brush but it feels so stiff
it's like a plastic stick if I put
talking and I'll do better here we have
it on camera for whatever reason it kind
of just looks like a pinkish weird gloss
on top of my lippy but in person is
definitely holographic looking like it
it's putting off a red and orange hue to
it it wasn't one different light hits it
but the camera I think my lighting so
diffused is I kind of soften up my lips
and yeah so that is that we're going to
try it out on my lips guide itself and
see what happen feeling my lips by
themselves I kind of want to try out
this purpley one this one seems kind of
like an extreme holographic lip and just
see like how it wears by itself it's so
cool now you hit it on and switch back
and forth you can definitely see that
it's like weird light rays going through
it it's so holographic this one's really
cool it kind of just looks like a clear
gloss until like different flecks of
lighting hit set this one is called
double whammy on it's very pretty and
it's a very subtle subtle subtle
holographic look it almost looks like a
clear lip gloss where this camera is
like toilet toying with this because it
kind of like diffusing it when different
light hits it it actually looks
holographic very subtly and you can see
like different flecks of light shining
through it kind of changes colors
looking like a little bit of an oil
spill on your lips so let's continue to
test out the other ones alright next I'm
going to put on cyber by Mac we're going
to try it with a dark Lizzy I actually
knew how to put on lipstick that would
be helpful so we have some purple lives
and I kind of feel like which one she
would sit on top of it I want some one
of these two these like glow sticks
right now I think I want to put on the
purpley one this one's called transcend
cool ah I think we hit a jackpot so this
one is really showing up how they look
in person on camera thank God I was kind
of like look but it was going to be a
bust
I mean it looks like I'm putting a glow
stick on my lips is so cool okay so
something that I'm learning with these
is it looks messy kinda and the heavier
hand it you go in with them and mixes
your lipstick with it and it dulls the
holographic fill so I feel like it might
work better with a liquid lipstick
because a lipstick doesn't ever dry
completely like flat on your lips hmm
it's kind of looking like patchy my next
step is to get a dark liquid lipstick
and test it out with I'm going to take
this art liquid lipstick from Stila
apply it to my lips and then try out
this one on top that we haven't tried
that yet is called other-worldly so now
I'm going to wait for the liquid
lipstick to dry completely and then
we're going to apply other-worldly on my
lips alert oh come on little I equip
watering all right I would definitely
say my list of lipsticks is dry do you
love how a little janky over there
that's okay
we're going to pretend that it's not
going to apply it I'm really nervous in
hopes that this is our most successful
one that looks cool
I'm already excited
well work better if I use my finger I
kind of feel like a little oh my god huh
so I think I found out how to make me to
work out successfully how much of this
is on my teeth this is the most oil
spill or holographic looking lips I
think I've ever seen I think this looks
really cool it kind of like you feels
like running from the corners of my
mouth these are not the easiest thing in
the world to work with and to apply to
your lips but they work out really cool
whenever you use a deeper liquid
lipstick because I feel like my nude
liquid lipstick that I started off with
it was really cool but it just didn't
really show off as well as much as it
does with a darker liquid lipstick or a
dark darker lipstick really because I
think it showed up really well with this
fiber lipstick it's just it kind of
melts it within the lipstick and it
didn't show up quite as good because of
that favorite so far is otherworldly I
think it's the easiest one to wear and I
think it's like the most holographic
looking one we have one more to test out
and I kind of went touch now on my lips
by themselves so you would call Malak
alright so lastly we have flip-flop
which is the orange pink red this one's
very vibrant and I'm excited to see what
its gonna look like alone on my lips I
really like this one on its own it's
very wearable and pretty again and not
that a holographic on its own so this
one just really looks glossy more than
anything I kind of want to try it on top
of a liquid lipstick I'm going to apply
naked eye on associate of really heels
on top of my lips and we're going to try
this one on top of it because I really
want to see it a little slight
mm these are kinda holographic but like
this situation of my lips right here is
nothing to call home about not that
holographic on the lips so this I would
say I get the least holographic mess out
of is flip flop so that is it for this
video guys thank you so much for
watching I hope you got some insight on
how these work they're really cool I'm
like again I think the most successful
way to wear them is with a dark liquid
lipstick let it dry completely and then
you get the most holographic look out of
it I hope you guys enjoyed this video be
