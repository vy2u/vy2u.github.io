video is going to be a little bit
different than my usual videos and that
is because I'm gonna go over some
commonly make a mistake or sometimes
made and after it very comfortable
talking about these because I'm one of
those people where everything in my life
is trial and error like I learn from my
mistakes because I feel like I've made
them all in makeup did make this video a
long time ago when I kind of first
started my channel was getting into
YouTube it was almost a year and a half
ago and people are still watching the
video all the time in the video is so
old definitely cover me to remake it but
that's not really what inspired me to do
this video what inspired me to do it
with my great friend Jackie she did this
video recently on her channel and she
did such an awesome job with the video
says with Jackie I think she's the
greatest gift to the planet I'm gonna
link her video down below I would love
for you guys to check our channel and
subscribe this isn't a collab video I
just thought she deserved recognition
and for that video because it's so
awesome so check out Jackie's video she
goes over makeup do's and don'ts also
right quick before we jump in I want it
to say it's something that you're doing
that I say is a don't and you like that
don't change it by all means if it makes
you feel good to do things a certain way
and your makeup routine and you feel
pretty I highly recommend keep doing it
I feel like that's what makeup is all
about I'm just making this video to help
people long maybe you're like god I
can't figure out how to do this right or
what's making me look this way and I can
help you with that in this video but
like I said if you are doing something
and I say it's wrong and it makes you
feel beautiful I highly recommend not
changing it but I do hope it inspires
some of you and maybe just helps you
along and learning tips and tricks
because I promise you I am going to tell
you a lot of tips and tricks in this
video on how I do my makeup and just
like how overlined my lips how I do my
eyeliner I hope you enjoy I hope this
video is really inside
and we're gonna get started I think
prime of your face is pretty essential
I'm only gonna prime half my face but I
do have my face good in this video in
the other half baddest you probably saw
from the thumbnail that I haven't even
created yet prime of your skin can help
hydrate it can also help smooth out the
skin depending on which primer you buy
this master prime smoothing blur is
obviously good for smoothing out and
blurring any imperfections next we'll
jump in to eyebrows I'm going to use the
on associate brow pomade
I feel like this product can be your
best friend in the whole wide world I
also feel like it can be your worst
enemy I have made more mistakes with
this product right here than with
anything I've ever done in my entire
life including picking boyfriend's no I
finally figured that out I get married
this product is like a double-edge store
so if you go in with too much you can
end up with like block crazy-looking
eyebrow big mistake I see people do is
just go in and literally draw their
eyebrow on with one stroke having my
brush into it I'm literally just drawing
some eyebrows in like that's too sick it
looks so unnatural I'm going to go ahead
and dedicate myself to this video with
filling it in I see the big block in the
front if you like to do them this bold
then by all means continue doing them
this way but I think that going in with
a little bit of a lighter hand can make
them look so much prettier I feel like I
used to make my eyebrows look like that
so what I like to do to create more of
the natural brow is I get the least bit
of product possible on my angled brush
this is the number 12 brush it will
literally feather instead of drawing a
straight line like I will feather the
bottom part of my brow and then I'm
going to kind of feather a little bit
more on the top part and I'm tracing my
actual eyebrows I'm not actually drawing
on
any extra for the front part of the
brows instead of blocking them off I'm
actually just gonna take the brush and
feather up a little bit and then smooth
it out with my spoolie one just looks a
little bit more natural and this one
just looks way too drawn on and fakey
looking I'm going to prime this eyelid a
common mistake is not priming your
eyelids just neglecting the eyeshadow
primer altogether
big mistake your eye your eye shadows
not going to show up as well and it's
also gonna crease I'm going to be doing
a super neutral look in this because I'm
not really trying to create a makeup
tutorial here I'm just trying to teach
you guys a couple things going in with
the Stardust palette by Vegas now I'm
going to go in with millennial which is
a super neutral color this is a big
mistake made often people go in with
heavy colors just right in the crease I
highly recommend finding a super neutral
e color and starting out with that
that's going to be your transition shade
and it's going to help build up your
darker colors especially if you're
trying to achieve a smoky eye so just
taking a brush and a little bit of
product and blending it out so on this
eye over here I'm actually not going to
do a transition shade I'm just going to
dive right in with our next shade so go
in with girls night which is just a
little bit of a deeper brown color I'm
just going to get some on the tip of my
brush trick with blending is to not
start on the outer edge or in the upper
crease area is actually to start deep in
your eye socket so pushing the brush
into my eye socket and blending the
color back and forth back and forth
until the brush is almost out of
eyeshadow and then once the brushes have
barely any eyeshadow you can start in a
circular motion blending the eyeshadow
up that way it's not going to look too
harsh and I'm not going to get too much
of that dark color way up by your brow
bone for this I'm going to go in with a
lot of eyeshadow on my brush and I'm
going to start with no transition shade
and I'm going to start higher up see how
this is not going to end up well and
like how will I ever get this blended
out it's already way too high touching
my brow bone oh man this is worse than I
actually thought it would be just
because I used a different amount of
product and I put the product in a
different area to start with look at the
difference
I'm going to show you something that I
see all the time was winged liner and
why it doesn't turn out just like you
always see on Instagram and stuff and
people's pictures you're like what is it
or turn out like that let me show you
what I see going wrong my hair's looking
crazy maybe I should do a hair doing
don't people will take their line and
they'll go straight up so whenever
you're ready to come back down with your
eyeliner now it looks I mean the wing is
just way too intense
there's silica eyeshadow we coming at
you like Catwoman and now I'll show you
how to get a little bit of a sleeker
look with your winged liner instead of
going straight up with my wing you can
actually get right in the crease and
come straight out right at the top and
I'm going to come straight in just like
I did with the other eye Lord knows I've
made every mistake in the book when it
comes to eyeliner especially whenever we
get our lashes on this wing over here it
looks a little bit thinner and a little
bit more precise we'll start on the face
a little bit I'm gonna go in with my
coverfx foundation and it's not the
right shade and I'm also gonna not put
it on exactly correctly over here I only
brought the foundation to my neck I
didn't cover my ear which is a complete
and total different color and I mean
hello we have the worst line ever partly
because the foundation is way too orange
for me I like to darken up my face but
the problem with doing that is a lot of
times people go to Russia with darker
just trying to bronze up their skin and
really give themself that dark tan glow
but if you do that a natural way we're
just doing it with the foundation alone
you end up with this orange II look I'm
gonna go in with sand which is by Too
Faced Born This Way I'm gonna blend this
all over my face including my ear and
I'm gonna bring it down by my jaw and my
neck area the Sun is not looking good
people we all love the brightening and
the brightening and the lovely bright
under-eye but I see well going two to
three to four shades lighter than their
skin tone I like to bring it one maybe
two shades brighter than my actual skin
tone to highlight the under-eye
area I don't even know one I have this
product I go in with a little bit of my
NARS custard which is an awesome shade
it is going to brighten but it's not too
far from my actual skin tone use my
finger to blend this one out the really
important step that gets skipped
sometimes is to set your concealer this
is going to help us avoid the powders in
my face all that creasing known is gonna
help this product last longer it's also
gonna help our mascara and stuff not to
run down into our concealer issues a
little bit of the make up forevers
chances then powder for that for here it
almost just looks like my natural skin
and over here I mean it's just such a
contrast now let's talk about contouring
going in with a super warm tone product
honestly I don't really even care for
warm tone bronzer products at all they
just they are very flattering and
natural-looking so I'm going to use this
warm tone dermablend bronzer to contour
my face we're going to bring down my
contour a little bit too far so you're
going to want to stop right about here
and just bring it up that way you're
just adding some emphasis on the
cheekbones and really structuring your
face starting to look like I have a
beard look at the difference in these
bronzer this is the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer this one is just going to
be way more flattering to start right
here at the top of the point of the ears
and then I'm a you're gonna bring it
down about half way and blend that out
we have this nice structured cheekbone
area it doesn't look so orange II and so
if you like adding lots of makeup like
me I'll even do something like this just
to clean up and sharpen that contour a
little bit now we'll talk about blush
sometimes with blushes we bring them up
too far and we use way too dramatic
colors and instead of giving your skin
just that natural soft blush you end up
looking like you might have gotten
punched in the cheek so go in with a
nice bobby tone brush so this one's
going to be super neutral super easy to
wear great to pair with lots of shadow
looks I'm going to start right here in
the back
and really light hand I'm just going to
buff a little bit of blush because I'm
not really looking for a pink cheek what
I'm looking for more is a natural flush
so now I'll go in with one that's too
harsh tap off some excess and I'm going
to bring it up way too good Lord way too
high one it's sticking into the
concealer because it didn't set it so
I'm putting a blush right on top of a
cream and it's not blending out well
until I brought it way too far up in the
front of the apple of my cheek when
really I like to blend blushes back a
little bit further whenever your
highlighting your face honestly I'm
using champagne pop by the way I'm going
to pop a little bit at the high point on
my cheekbone just to give us that nice
glow and I'm even going to bring it
around my temple a little bit you can do
a little bit down the nose too then you
bring it just a little bit too far down
which can't look flattering but in this
case this is gonna be way too dramatic
and I look crazy honestly right here it
just looks more so like I needed down my
face over here I mean I'm looking a
little bit more soft like I have a nice
warm glow to me incident I see sometimes
with false lashes is the lash is brought
too far down and it looks limp dragging
the eye down could possibly make you
look a little bit older so I'm going to
do that on this side see it nice and
close to the lash line but I just see
the lash coming too far out see this is
not even this is something I see pretty
often so it's like if you'll just pull
the lash up closer to your inner corner
I can really pull a thigh let it make
you look younger and more awake can you
tell the difference try to bring that
eyelash in a little bit closer and clip
them at the end if they're way too long
that way you don't end up looking a
little janky on your edge right there
another little booboo I see is the lower
lash line can be your best friend or
your worst enemy I'm telling you people
instead lining your waterline actually
bringing the lighter down a little bit
too far like on your lash line and I
mean that can be pretty once it's smoked
out but at the same time I'm going to
show you like how much it can really
drag your eye down and make you look
older I lined my lash line
as well as my waterline with just a
little bit of black liner so what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to line my
other eye with the nude color which is
going to open up our eyes also smoke out
your lower lash line that way it is a
bear and you can add a little bit of
darkness so what I'll do is I'll go in
with this palette and grab a little bit
of millennial first and buffing it right
underneath taking a bit of girls night
and taking that really close to the lash
line and that is going to smoke out our
lash line and give us a little bit of
definition because I just look so much
happier and bigger than this one over
here lining the lips in just a big
boo-boo
I see ours going in with a little bit of
a dual liner and I really sharp liner
can be a super no-no and also whenever
you overdraw your lips which is totally
okay to overdraw your lips I don't think
there's anything wrong with that
a my focus big boo-boo with it is over
drawing it at the Cupid's bow so watch
this looks crazy unnatural and I just so
looks like I speared my makeup
everywhere let me show you how to
properly over line your lips so instead
of starting at the Cupid's bow I'm going
to go in with a sharpened pencil I'm
actually going to start at the corner of
my mouth
and when I get to my cubits boat I'm
going to actually line my real Cupid's
bow by not over line
lining that area so I'm more so over
lined the outer edge of my lips making
my lips look fuller instead of like
bigger up in the Cupid's bow area
um these just look honestly they just
look fake and it looks like I did a bad
job lining my lips and it also helps
whenever your pencil sharpener is our
difference that we finished yeah here
honestly I look too hard I look too
dramatic I look like it's just crazy
makeup over here I applied you know the
bronze are the highlight the blush the
foundation the concealer the lash is the
mascara but it still doesn't look that
crazy because I put them in the right
area and I use the right colors so I
hoped all my tips and tricks really
helped you guys out with doing your
makeup and I know if you're doing
something wrong you're not totally going
to turn out all right this because I did
everything wrong on this side but what
are two things could really make a
difference in your makeup but again
remember what I said if you think what
you're doing is right and enhances your
beauty within by all means please keep
doing it'll of you guys thank you for
stopping by please give this video a
thumbs up if it was helpful
and I hope to see you all in my next
video ah this is my alter ego</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
