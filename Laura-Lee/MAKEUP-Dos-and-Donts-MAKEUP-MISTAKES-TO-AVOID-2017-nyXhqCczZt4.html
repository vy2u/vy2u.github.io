today I got a busy week ahead so I'll be
filming all day today's video is
actually going to be makeup do's and
don'ts I've definitely done this channel
I've definitely done this video before
on my channel and I find it to be very
helpful but if I feel like you really
steer people where they think they might
be going wrong with their makeup and
help them and show them how to do it
right not just tell them how they're
doing it wrong I've always gotten pretty
good feedback on these videos so I enjoy
redoing them every now and again to post
an update at 1 now I just want to say in
the beginning of this video that don't
feel like just because I'm like this is
wrong that you're like oh my god I like
the way that looks on me I'll change it
if you like the way something you're
doing looks then keep doing it because
that's what's important and technically
there are no rules in makeup really echo
like this video is mostly here for
people who are trying to achieve a very
specific look and I'm not there's a buzz
and I'm hoping that I can totally get
you there make it was so much fun and I
feel like as a makeup artist and in the
industry you can never stop learning a
true makeup artist never stops learning
no one's a know-it-all no one knows
every single thing about makeup because
this is art but I hope this video is
helpful for you guys and I hope you take
from it what you want to and what you
don't girl leave behind leave it in the
video leave it on the Internet I love
teaching makeup so much and I love
talking about it I do a lot of hits and
misses because I find the filming
tutorial after story after story is so
redundant sometimes is really fun and
just take a break from that and test out
some cool products and see what's new
out there on the market but as for today
we're going to be learning about makeup
and yeah I hope the video is helpful and
we'll go ahead and jump right into this
video first things first I had a zoom
you in a little bit because you need to
see what's going on let's get started
with priming the skin I find that this
honestly if you feel like your skin acts
pretty normal with makeup and you're
happy without a primer dull time your
skin but you're having problem areas
like dry skin pores there
primer out there for that that can help
that so today I'm going to do a pore
minimizing primer at the Smashbox
photo-finish I'm going to do a little
bit on one side of my face and then
leave it off on the other side my face
what's going to be the good side let's
do the good side right here so I'm going
to go ahead and massage it into the
areas where my pores trying to get a
little weird and that's all I'm going to
do because I feel like whenever you're
usually go for minimizing primer you
don't have to coat the whole entire half
of your face and this I'm just going to
leave the primer off I typically like to
prime next up we're going to talk about
foundation and I recently just did like
a whole spiel on foundations if you want
to see that video I'll link it down
below but in the meantime let's talk
about the fact that I want a little bit
of a more tan so I'm going to go to a
darker foundation I don't really
recommend doing that because you can
really bronze up your skin with a little
bit of a bronzer versus like dropping
three shades and dark and dr. pepper oh
my gosh dropping three shades and
foundations so we're going to go ahead
and drop those shades over here I'm
using the Laura Mercier flawless fusion
ultra foundation I have been loving this
I literally had it pointed down and it
shot across the room a map showing
footage believe this is like my thing to
bounce light in the foundation just
explode it all over it okay so we're
going to be a little funky today let's
try that again I'm kind of nervous this
is a really great long wearing
foundation that just looks really pretty
on the skin the shade four in one is too
dark for me and so I've been mixing it
with three see one these were sent to me
so I just mix them and it works out
great I may be using my fabulous y6
brush from morphe I'm going to show you
guys I don't want to do this even if you
bring it down the neck girl you ain't
fooling nobody nobody's gonna say you
got a tan they're going to say you got a
new foundation I just feel this looks
super orange and unnatural now I'm going
to mix a little bit of the foundations
together and do the other side of my
face see it's just slightly darker but
we can still bronze that up and really
get that natural glow happening
that looks a bit softer than the other
side but I still don't look to tell you
know it's like a good happy medium
happening here next up is the concealer
concealer is known to be used for
highlighting under the eyes but a tidbit
here is you only want to take it one
maybe two shades lighter than your
foundation not six shades lighter and
also I find that using less concealer
which we're honestly not doing on this
side it helps it last longer and blends
out softer than going the whole extra
mile now you can do just if you want to
I've just been using a little bit less I
like that and then I'll blend it in a
triangular motion versus coat a face in
it like this so lets blend out the sides
and calculator I'm going to use brush
I'm also going to stipple it out you see
how I kind of dragged it down to get
that highlighted effect versus just
applying it all over all the way down
just where so much longer I swear to you
now I'm just going to take my our teeth
brush oh do this side and it's just like
girl I met
there's too much product to blend out
and then also it's like really
contrasting against that foundation it's
blended out soft with the contrast it's
like unreal so okay next I'm going to
show you powder so I like to use a
translucent powder with a little bit of
a cream texture cream look to it but it
only doesn't flashback I've been
enjoying the new toothpaste one as well
as covereth acts today I'm going to be
using the Too Faced Born This Way powder
and I just sprinkle some in the lid and
then I'll take a sponge and I'll just
i'm the good stuff it's got it all my
lashes don't get in your lashes okay do
as I say not as I do
and you can let it set there I like to
press it into the skin and kind of just
even press it in the small lines
leave it for a second skin already looks
soft and not too harsh or contrasting so
as I like to tell people is don't go in
with a foundation powder on top of your
foundation it should look a lot of
makeup foundation powders are pretty
much meant to be worn alone as your
powder foundation not with a full
coverage foundation so I'm going to
apply this now and show you the tea on
it there's actually a nice foundation
powders we worn alone I like it it's got
somewhat coverage to it just showing you
just like a lot of makeup happening
Wella neutralize out our concealer
because this is like a nice shade of
foundation it's can medium honey and
this is the I don't know this is a tart
powder that it's the little - I know
that but anyways this is a really nice
brush to pack it into but it's just like
a lot of heavy makeup and it may look
good right now but throughout the day
foundations on top of foundation on top
of images it doesn't wear well so you
might start breaking apart sloughing off
getting really creepy and heaviness
because it's just too much makeup okay
let's talk about bronzers so bronzers
you really if you're contouring you
don't want to go in with a really orange
shade this is a more Orange e1 as bronze
goddess by Estee Lauder I find it this
one is great for bronzing up the skin
but not contouring it's super orangie so
we're going to go on this side we're
going to chisel out some cheekbones this
orange I'm looking like a Bahama Mama
over here with some super Orangina bring
it around the hairline even honestly I
feel like it just isn't a natural
contour it just looks like I put warned
to bronzer everywhere and now I'll show
you this side doing a front of look this
is a morphe m100 brush and the hoola
bronzer now let me show you the
difference in the coolness of it this
one's a lot cooler now you can play with
how cool tone your bronzer is depending
on your skin tone I've gone through the
Kevin
one it was way too cool made me look
great but this little one works really
well for me I'm gonna like bronze oven
I'm going to contour out that cheekbone
so here is the good side of my face I
feel like it looks a little bit softer
and more natural of a contour and then
this eye looks a little bit muddy and
it's just so unnatural now you can use a
warm tone bronzer just to kind of flush
all over and really warm up this skin
like I was saying instead of going in
with a warmer foundation but as far as
contouring I like to stick it to more
natural softer bronzers I'm going to
grab the deep mob blush from covergirl
I'm going to show you how you can
definitely wear a pretty deeper blush
but you don't have to go in so
heavy-handed we're going to find that a
lot of blush right here just doesn't
look natural blush is meant to give you
a little bit of natural flesh and color
back in the skin because you kind of
wiped it out with all the foundation so
I like to tap my brush into it and then
give it an extra tab you can either
fling it on the lid to get some the
excess blush off I do smile and honestly
I like to work my blush bag just a
little bit very soft like that it's real
soft now if you're not tapping off
excess blush and really focusing it on
the front of that cheek area as you can
see I have a little bit of flush of
color and I find it it looks a little
bit softer and more natural right here
oh right here girl
looks like flicked in the cheek so you
just want to go lightening it with blush
I find the blush is one of the products
I'll even skip sometimes comes not in
the mood to have a blush on but you know
you want to be careful okay next up is
highlighters what can we do wrong with
highlighters well I feel like you know
put on as much highlighters if you
definitely want I'll never tell you not
to but I also feel like putting it in
the right place is important too
so this one is skinny dip buys you a I'm
going to take my white 14 highlighter
brush and I find it if you can keep the
highlighter away from poor areas because
they pick up so much texture and pores
you really focus it only like right in
there
just right in there and then you can
even swoop it around like a dab on the
forehead if you don't have Olli skin and
you should really leave it at that and
then my finger I'll put a DAB on the
note and then they keep it slow and
leave it at that and then over here
we're going to go ahead and just bring
it all the way to the front of the cheek
to the back to the front to the back to
the front to the back and you'll see my
pores are glowing honey it's just too
much and then you don't want to add too
much on the forehead too cuz it can look
really muddy add as much highlight as
you want but maybe just in the right
area so next I'm going to spritz the
side of my face with my morphe setting
spray and then what I'm going to do is
Pat that watery texture into my skin and
it just really makes everything look way
more natural on my skin versus really
powdery and unnatural you see like how
powdery the skin looks first this over
here it's like kind of dewy and looks
more just like my skin happening Oh
beloved eyebrows let's do it first I
like to really just comb the brows
upward and then I take my precisely brow
pencil by benefit and shade number four
and this is what I like to do I really
like my brow to start right in here on
up if not even more in the center I find
it too thick of the brow to like the
more youthful this is like oh okay the
more youthful appearance you can get so
what I like to do is where I'm missing
brow hair right here I'll just go
straight across and out what I find
mistakes that I've made in the past a
lot is I drag my brow down too far and
it will play my eyes bumping or they
don't start far enough in the center so
I am going to make sure we have the brow
extended out and we pull the brow in I
do hair like strokes in the front of the
brow and then I even spoolie through
them too so that looks like more like
hairs versus brow like a blocky brow
and I'll come on out and at this part
instead of going straight down I'll try
to bring it out a little bit kind of
like that and that is basically how I
fill in my eyebrows like it still has an
arch but I'm more so did the arch
underneath the brow too and sit up on
top so here I'm not going to comb the
brows and groove them upward and I'm
also going to go ahead and create more
of a filled in front to the brow first
is to shoot a few strokes we're going to
make it more blocky and if you notice I
didn't even draw in the top of my brows
I just left it at that
I'm also going to bring the brow down
pretty low showing you guys that you
don't want to drag down the face and
I'll show you how if you ignore the
blocky front help still just dragging it
down and not brushing through the
product kind of looks like I got a sad
face going on you know like the brow is
just too far down so my eye looks kind
of like slumping and then the front is
just so natural because blocky versus
getting the sparse hairs like that next
up you guys know to prime your eyes but
I'm not going to do it on the bad side
which I do have a little bit of
concealer so we cheat a little bit but
I'm going to go ahead and prime I've
been enjoying this lid lock and shade
buff by Tarte and really I just love it
eyelid it's so important to prime your
eyelids if I did this one's really good
if you have only eyelids as well and I
kind of like it a little smoky one of my
greatest tips I can give you and make of
a star with a transition shade so we're
going to go ahead and go with a lighter
brown shade any neutral brown shade
normally works perfectly as a transition
shade so what I like to do is pop it
into the crease the lighter the color
the higher I go the darker the color I
keep it down low there you go there's a
little riddle to try to help you out
with your eyeshadows just so you're not
taking like the really dark colors all
the way up to your eyebrows now if you
like that little girl go ahead and do it
is your makeup your
art but I prefer just for a softer
gradient look so I try to keep the
lighter ones a little bit higher in the
darker ones a little lower and that's a
nice transition shade we're going to
skip the transition shade over here and
we're going to dive right into some
color I really love this shade right
here use it's like a really pretty burnt
brownie maroon II color and I'm going to
just start working it in so as you can
see the color is blending super patchy
because there's no transition shade down
that helps soften up that concealer
that's on the eye so now as you can see
it's sticking the color also looks kind
of harsh because it doesn't gradiate
into any softer colors it's more so just
setting on my eyeball you see that I
mean it's not the end of the world but I
find that you can make it look really
good if you'll just take your time with
a couple of transition shades
I'm going to take this mustardy yellow
color on this side and it's a little
deeper so we're going to keep it a
little bit lower and we're just going to
blend it right into the crease and
really softly build up color before we
get into some major colors
I'll even mix a little bit of this shade
in there as well and just keep it lower
now that that is softly blended up I
feel like we can now dive into a little
bit of color I'm going to take my morphe
r39 brush and dip into this reddish
brown color buff it right into that
crease one blending I prefer to do small
strokes versus huge ones in the
beginning so you're taking the loaded
brush with color and you're softly
buffing the color in and then you can go
back and forth with whatever is left on
your brush so now we'll get into that
deeper red color now that we build up a
few brown shades and really work it in
pretty low you can tell the difference
really now and like the colors radiating
up versus this side just has one color
is a little patchy because of lack of
the softening up of the concealer that
was on the eye
take my morphe 421 brush and I'm going
to dabble in almond I'm just going to
give the gold I guess it's like my
favorite color in this palette and on
this eye I'm not going to wet it I'm
just going to start pressing it all over
which actually it still looks beautiful
I assure you because the colors are just
creamy and you know on to wet them in
this palette but I'm going to take this
popery color right here I'm going to add
a little bit of a setting spray to it to
dampen it which prevents fallout as well
as you can see I have a little bit on my
I'm just gonna put this fiery color oh
yes boid all over my eyelid and because
the brush is dampen and I'm really
softly going in you can get a pretty
clean look out of it lately I've been
leaving my brow bone pretty simple I
just haven't been feeling the over
highlighted brow bone anymore I did it
for a long time but now I'm kind of over
it we're going to over highlight the
brow bone we're going to go ahead and go
in with this bright color and I'm just
going to add some highlighter to this
brow bone over here this is just going
through it so it looks super bad
I'm sure if you do some of these steps
wrong your eye doesn't turn out this bag
because I'm doing them all wrong over
here girl ms/ms
alright next up we're getting there
people were almost done if you're going
to be adding false lashes I definitely
recommend tightlining the eye which is
taking a little bit of black liner and
running it on the upper eyelid and then
also kind of fiddling some black right
in the lash line so you can hide the
lash band it's not as noticeable I would
also like to probably say have made
every mistake in applying false lashes
so let me be the teacher here today yes
today I'm going to be applying some
mosquito lashes and grandiose so here's
the big kicker that I catch often people
don't trim their lashes they're not
trimming them properly what you want to
do is measure the lash to the eye and
cut off all the excess you can start by
cutting off a little and then go back in
and cut off a little more if you need to
because remember you can't add lash
but you can always take more off so just
don't cut off too much and destroy your
high lash because I've done that too
there goes my way too long eyelash what
you're going to see is going to make the
eye look like it does my eye like it's
like going downward I mean I might need
my eyebrow but I'll show ya if you just
trim that end off it can really uplift
the eyeball so another little mistake
I've seen in my time is not adding
mascara to attach the real lashes to the
false lashes you can definitely see them
all dusty right here so once the dry
glue is dried a little bit more I'm
going to do it on this side and then
we're just only these girls hanging over
here now I'm going to add a little bit
of makeup to my under eye I typically
like to go in with a transition shade in
a medium brown shade and buff it you can
honestly take a lighter brown shade and
go from inner to outer corner just make
sure you're not dragging the eyeshadow
down too low and when I don't have
eyeliner on I really like to connect it
right there to the outer corner and then
I like to take a tighter brush this is
the e43
with a darker shade and really push it
close to the lash line not taking it
down too far like that and now we have
the smoked out lower lash line I'm going
to add a little bit of my eyeliner in
that waterline but I made sure to keep
in the wire line and not drag it down
too low now on this side we're going to
add a little bit too much dark shadow
again without transitioning it out we're
going to go in with our deeper shade
from inner to outer corner and I just
find that it drags the eye down a little
bit and then I'll go in with my eyeliner
and then I'll put it in the waterline
but I'll also smudge a little in the
lashes and show you if you put too much
and dark on the lower lash line it can
really weigh down the eye make it look
kind of droopy do you see how this ayat
just is too aggressive you really just
want to keep that liner right in the
waterline and I've seen people like with
a little brush get some liner and just
very softly smudge it right underneath
those lower lashes but not taking it
down this far but now let me add a
little bit
some mascara over here one off so now
that the lashes are pretty much attached
to my fault flashes let's do some lips
let's do something
all right the kicker with really light
nude lipsticks I'm going to show you how
to wear them today this is darken swayed
by jeffree star cosmetics it's a right
nude color if it's won the right way so
I'm going to just go in and apply it all
over this side as you can tell it's a
little bit too light so what I really
like to do is apply a liner with it to
give it some dimension if you already
have beautiful dark lips and you can
honestly just a little bit as a color
right in the center and tap it out with
your finger and you already have that
dimension this is curvy lip liner by
color top I'm just going to add it right
there it's more softly blend it out over
here and then over here whoa that's
right that is it guys I know some people
are going to comment and say they like
this side better and that's okay but I
personally prefer this side over here I
hope this video was helpful oh my gosh
let's do the little happy face she's
smoking so that's a fun video I'll see
you guys in my next video comment down
your favorite part of this video I love
you guys thank you so much for being
here watching and now see you in the
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
