didn't really do anything hey guys
what's up I bust out laughing and I
don't know why hey guys what's up and
welcome to my channel today's video is
going to be about products that I cannot
live without now I like to do this every
3-5 months or so because that situation
changes and I find myself in a rut of
products that I just use day in and day
out and they're just trying true
products I travel so much now and
whenever I'm putting this same products
in my travel bag every time it's the
products that I count on and the parts I
know that won't steer me wrong also if
you guys want to see a tutorial on with
the products I talked about today like a
tutorial of my Holy Grail products and
let me know down in the comment section
down below
but yea I just went through my makeup
bag and I just got back from New York
and I was like you know what you should
rub these products because you love them
so much and I feel like you know your
peeps need to know you need to know the
good I talked a lot about what doesn't
work for me but we also need to talk
about some favorites they do work from
me to someone sexton what were we
talking about I completely lost my train
of thought before we jump into the video
let's sing a special little
love you learn without further ado we're
gonna go ahead and jump right into the
video so I hope you're excited to learn
about some products that I'm loving a
lot of these again are products that I
it's just more than a favourites it's a
product that's an absolute go-to for me
and so I tried to switch it up in parts
that haven't really talked about before
I already said that and then true and
I'm kind of reiterating myself all right
so first things first is this hello
flawless powder
now this isn't often on product for me
is because I try out so many products
and as being on YouTube I think that's
really important for me to switch it up
and try out different products and that
way I can give you guys my perspective
and we can learn about different
products together what works and what
doesn't
but I always come back to this product
it's the hello flawless face powder this
is in the shade honey and I love it to
set my face with this because it is a
foundation powder and normally I don't
like to add a foundation powder all over
a foundation because I finally it's a
lot of makeup but this one it's just a
little bit lighter but that's really
pretty on top of foundation and looks
really good and I'll even touch up my
spots where I get a little bit oily here
and there and also when traveling this
isn't just a travel favorites I don't
know I'm talking about traveling so much
but when traveling I'll even store
little bobby pins and rubber bands and
things right in there and keep it close
there's a little travel tip for ya but
this is a really really really great
facial powder and you can set your
foundation with it as well and it's not
too heavy
next up I'm gonna go a random order or
not any order random order contradicts
itself so I'm just gonna go random
you're gonna go cry cry on this okay
anyways next product is the moisture our
balm from Garnier Fructis I recommended
this in my video where talked about how
to stop oily skin and what great
products to use to avoid hitting only
skin or to help control so all so this
was what the products that I mentioned
and it's just have tried and true for me
and so this was so many people have
tweeted me telling me that this product
has changed your life and I absolutely
believe if you switched from a cream
heavy moisturizer
this if you have only skin I am somewhat
dry skin and this still just works for
me it's great and the best part is it's
affordable so this is an absolute dupe
as well for the moisture bomb by um aqua
bomb for the aqua bomb by belief which
is that Sephora super pricey Korean
skincare this is like as direct do its
anyways um moving right along
okay next product another random one so
this is a product that's super new to me
and honestly I haven't been traveling
with it because it's so big and I knew I
could pour it and a smaller thing would
it ain't that serious anyways this is I
only travel my essentials by the way I
don't travel with things that like I
absolutely don't need I'm just a light
packer okay anyways um so this product
is a rose body and hair all oh boy it's
an oldie product so you get to hear me
say the word over and over again
incorrectly oh oh but anyways this is my
way it's a newer product I mean it takes
a smidge I literally pumped one half of
a score for my whole entire chest area
if you can see I'm super to be a bump
right there try to show my chesticles in
there that make that bob I put this all
over my buddy and it took one had little
half of a hair of a pump and that is why
you barely see any of it used because I
don't I would never like push this all
the way down because they're gonna have
all over your whole entire body and head
so I love love love this product it
smells like roses I personally love the
smell roses if you don't I don't know
that you'll be that obsessed with a
scent but the actual product is a great
system multi-use product you get like
this is gonna last me three years to be
honest just cuz you barely need any of
it look at my hand breathing but you can
apply this all over your body it gives
you such a glow a healthy moisture look
look it makes your skin feel unreal soft
it makes you smell so good all day
because your skin absorbs the oil and
then it absorbs this smelling your smell
so good you can even after what's left
on your hands kind of hit the hair with
it to give it that extra shine so as a
multi-use product and it is a great
great great great product and I girl I
love it
a ladder lav laughs all right so that
cat is out of its cage and now let's
talk about oh look what it is are you
guys tired of me talking about this yet
well don't get tired honey because I got
a lot more talking to do this is cats
pajamas you guys know this is my makeup
palette that crea all by myself and my
own makeup line and T on this is I've
been using it forever in a day without
you guys knowing so this is it's what's
on my eyes right now I just did a
tutorial I'll link to it below if you
want to see how I got this look this is
Nick and I adored the palette I do a
bazillion different looks with it and it
is my absolute go to plus the size is
perfect is heavy and luxurious filling
but it is perfect for travel and as that
nice case where the shadows don't get
broken so I never worry when I pack this
for travel and it slides right down into
my little makeup bag here and I just I
can do a complete look so I don't have
to pack this palette plus another
palette plus a single eyeshadow I can
just like one and done this is just my
go-to for a longer than you guys know so
I just absolutely have to mention this
as my go-to appellant in this video I
have to I have to do it it would be
sinful for me not to okay next product
is my brow pencil that you guys already
know what it is is the precisely my brow
that's right precisely my brow pencil
and shade number four I've been using
this product since especially oh girl
you said the wrong brand since benefit
came out with this product and I like it
a lot I find that it's creamy and super
easy to use and that the pin on it is so
fine you can create the hair light
strokes and get like they're really this
one's called precise but you can get the
really precise sharp edge with it and
that's what I go for my brows another
thing that I really like about this I
love the brow was from a special Beverly
Hills like I truly truly truly truly
love it I just find my only tidbit with
it is that it runs out so quick I felt
like I was buying two or three a month
like I was just burning through them and
I just had to keep buy and keep buying
keep buying so with this this is lasts
way longer I don't know if it has less
wax in it so the product doesn't burn
out as much or has more pigment in it I
don't know the specifics on why it lasts
longer but I definitely don't have to
get a new one these nearly as much as I
was having to buy the a BH one they're
both great products I just find that
that one run
too much I have to do my brows every day
so I'm like girl I need a product that's
gonna hang with me and last a lemon
longer because this isn't a cheap
product and neither is honest Asha
Beverly Hills ones next up for a blush
that I just think is over the moon and
great and I love it and again this is a
little bit of a newer succession but I
just love it I really do this is the
flower beauty this is the peach promise
blush so if you guys know me and have
been known on my channel I am like a
sucker for a peach matte or shimmer
blush Mac peaches was one of my favorite
blushes of all time and it truly still
is but this is pretty much a dupe for as
well so I thought I wouldn't mention it
because I've been using this non-stop
now just to switch it up a little bit
but you we're still using the same thing
this is a flower beauty's blush I just
wanna say all of their blushes are
genius they're so good they have extreme
pigmentation so this one looks barely
used but I've used it about 10 times I'm
wearing it today I think it's great I
just have to go in like look how much
colors on my brush and I barely tap it
like you have to go in with such a light
hand with these because they have a lot
of pigmentation and they feel like Lux
blushes for a low price that you can get
these at Walmart next up is for a
concealer and tart shape tape is a
tried-and-true and always will be but
this is a concealer that I feel like is
a little bit of a lighter fill to it and
so I like it just a little bit more this
is the NARS radiant creamy concealer
I've been using the shade custard for
about 4 years now and I remember when
our set me up your package with this in
it I was like because I probably have
all ten of these and they're not that
cheap so I love love love this product
it just you can't go wrong I feel like
Nicole Guerrero's the one that got me
hooked on it that she was using on her
channel like so long ago and I was like
girl let me give that try you say it's
good I don't believe it's good and
girlfriend it is good it is so good I'm
wearing it now it gives me that flawless
under-eye very lightweight feeling very
easy to blend out doesn't crease lasts
long does everything you need and I
sometimes have a little bit of trouble
finding my right shading and sealer
because it's either too pink or too
orange or too light or too dark
sometimes I can't get right and custard
it's just a shade that I know is like
perfect so now I'm gonna talk about lash
glue and I know that may be weird but
guys I used
glue every time I do my makeup and I
just have I have to tried in truths and
one I don't know where one is but I want
to mention it because it's it's one that
I love it's the hood of beauty lash glue
it's really really really really good
it's also a very powerful lash glue so
if you're gonna be wearing your lashes
for a really long time that one's nice
to try out it is black but I like that
it doesn't rip out my lashes whenever
I'm ready take it off it has the more of
the Elmer's glue like gummy effect we're
just kind of pops off and it's like
actually fun and pleasurable to pick off
your lashes and the second one is this
disgusting two right here that's been
with me for way too long this is the duo
lash glue I like it in dark but you can
get this in clear as well if you're not
comfortable using the dark one because
sometimes I get in cause Boo Boo's but
this is literally one of my favorite
last lash
glues do mhm great lash glue they make
one that's like iridescent looking that
comes with a brush and I love a brush
but that one I find rips on my lashes
cuz I can't get it off and since this
one doesn't come with the brush I'll dip
it on the back of my hand and spend the
end of a makeup brush in it look at that
hair you can't see it but dear God
anyways and I'll rub the end of the
brush along the lash line to get it
precisely on the lash line just a little
tipped up you do that but this lash glue
is so good and I count it all the time I
mean yeah my lashes have come loose
since I have worn it probably 200 times
I would say a couple times my lash come
loose mostly that has to do with water
and my eyes watering and water will
loosen that up but I would rather have
that happen and then it'd rip out all my
real lashes all three of my real lashes
that I have left for a highlighter that
I absolutely adore this one's from the
drugstore and I want to talk about
because I think it's just one of the
best jokes or highlighters they come out
with I've dealt with so many jokes with
highlighters they're absolutely flops
and I just don't use them because I
don't like them and I don't want to lie
and pretend like something's good just
because it's cheap whenever I just truly
don't like it but this one well this one
is like changing the game this is the
master chrome highlighter from
Maybelline and it's just the formula of
it is extremely blinding and pigmented
it's very creamy a little flaky as you
can see but I'm I don't mind a little
flakiness as long as
that pigmentation also whenever you see
something's just a little flaky hit it
with a little bit of water hit with a
little bit of fix+
it seals the deal right then in there
and just like one small tiny rub across
it it's more blinding than most high-end
highlighter so it's like why waste your
money on super fancy highlighters
whenever you can get this guy right here
for a super affordable price and they
also have another one I personally the
gold one it's called number 100 molten
gold but they have a lighter one I
believe I love that one on my skin tone
I'm not wearing it right here I'm only
we're gonna hear but you know I'm saying
I think it's great another try and true
product that I found a true love for
while I was vacationing is this by fresh
this is their sport fresh lip balm that
I'm actually not allergic to so it
doesn't have an ingredient that the
chapstick brand has in it but this is
really great because you can use it on
your lips and you can also use it even
if you want to look around the eye area
it says it's for the face as well but
what I like about this lip balm is that
it likes ills and like sticks to your
lips so whenever you have a lot to do or
you're busy I get chapped lips really
easy cuz I don't drink enough water
sometimes so this really does the job
for me it's just clear by the way and
super well this one's brand new which is
exciting my other ones down in my travel
back somewhere but it's a great product
and it also has sunscreen in it so SPF
30 which is great and so it will truly
protect your skin you won't have
anything to worry about there and it's
just an overall great product alright so
I'm gonna talk about three brushes today
there's so many brushes them obsessed
with and I've talked about a lot of
those in the past so I don't want to
beat a dead horse but these are brushes
that I don't think I'm necessarily hit
on too too much so the first one is the
morphe 49 brush I've recently fallen
madly in love with this brush first of
all its size I think I have a small head
and so this brush is great because the
powder I probably loose powder with it
by the way or you can apply pressed
powder with it but because of its dome
shape top its just perfect to get right
in there and set it without the powder
exploding everywhere the brush isn't too
big it's great for this area great for
sharpening of this area because it has
that tip but then I love the size of the
brush and it's super soft next one for a
couple thing
this is the m5 at 72 I love this brush
to put black product in my hair to cover
my hairline and that is gray hair and
also to contour the nose to bake the
nodes as some baking powder if you want
to like chopped right here and add some
powder to blend out your eyeshadow look
this brush is used for so many things
it's a perfect little sized flat top
brush and it also is a little bit raspy
which as you guys know I just personally
prefer brushes that um kind of like this
Smith one that has like a little raspy
Ness to it and then also the r-36 I just
get asked all the time what's a good
highlighting brush what's good a
highlighting brush I personally don't
like using fan brushes like I'm done
with those I feel like they explode
product everywhere and they don't pick
up enough product so I don't like fan
brushes anymore like those days are past
me times change
times have changed I like the r36 brush
I like a brush like this kind of raspy
again and it just picks up a lot of
product and it's just a little bit more
dense than a fan brush and because it
has that tip you can get it really
precise and applying product to your
face so this has just been my
tried-and-true highlight new brush right
here and that is it oh let's talk about
foundation real quick okay so lots of
foundations have come out that I love
but and I've talked about the hourglass
vanish so much so I'm not gonna talk
about this video we're gonna move on but
I found another tried-and-true
foundation that I've really given my
trust to and it has not sold me yet this
is the Laura Mercier a flawless fuse
information and it is one of my
favorites is full coverage and the thing
that I just trust and love about this
the most is that how long-lasting it is
sometimes I get myself in a situation
where I have to ever make up for 10
hours and it has to look good for 10
hours now I don't know I go back good
for 10 hours but whatever I have this
foundation on I know my foundation is
gonna look good for 10 hours it doesn't
matter how long I have my foundation on
it's just gonna look good with this it's
like glues to your skin and I really
like it because it doesn't move it
doesn't budge or if I bump my face I
don't feel like I would wiped half my
makeup off with this foundation also
whenever you use it just a
recommendation to use you know an old
base makeup remover to really get it off
of your skin but
to foundation that I trust by the way
I've been mixing the other two shades
suntan and dune I did get my shade and
then I lost the foundation because my
life is a whirlwind of craziness right
now but so I do have these from the PR
package I just mix them together I'll
figure out my shade hopefully I figure
it out only get in description box but I
obviously can't figure it out and can't
make it to Sephora by the time this
video goes live to figure it out well
then we're all dude I guess I'll just be
awarded a bad beauty blogger anyways
that is it for this video guys thank you
so much for watching and I hope this
opened your eyes to some really great
products if you haven't heard of them
before I'm sure you've heard of someone
because I talk about them all the time
