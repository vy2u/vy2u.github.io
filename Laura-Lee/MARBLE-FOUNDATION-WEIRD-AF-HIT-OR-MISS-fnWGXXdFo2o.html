today's video we are going to test out a
very strange foundation that I found on
Amazon it's probably one of the weirdest
foundations I've ever seen and whenever
I got it in the mail is even weirder
than what it look like online so I was
like yes we have to test this out plus
it has an interesting like description
about it so I can't wait to read that to
you guys and like tell you this is about
the foundation that we're gonna try out
I'll give you a little sneak peek of it
it's right here Oh super weird in this
video I'm gonna announce a couple little
announcements really quick in the intro
to guys and then yeah we'll roll on into
the video and testing things out first
off September it is officially September
hello fall time how are you I wish the
weather would cool down a little bit but
September first of my birthday and I had
the best birthday ever I celebrated a
little early birthday with Smashbox
models and Fiji they threw me a really
cool surprise birthday was a beautiful
cake and everybody sang happy birthday
and we took shots and danced the night
away
it was fabulous thank you Smashbox for
that that wasn't an announcement I just
rambled that off I got excited about it
okay the month is September and this is
the month where I'm going to reveal the
first product of my makeup line so we
make it mine the first product of it is
going to launch in October and I'm gonna
reveal the product at the end of
September so shall we start counting
down I cannot believe it's already here
I worked for so long and now it's like
holy SH I stood the reveal is already
here I'm like so nervous about it
because deep down inside it's obviously
the greatest thing in the world to me
and I created it and I think it's just
perfect and so I just hope the rest of
the world loves it just as much as I do
and my whole body just turns into jello
on the inside whenever I talk about it
cuz I'm just I'm really excited about it
also nervous this is a huge step in my
life for me I don't know it's just a lot
of emotions are involved but I'm really
happy about the product and I use it all
the time and you guys don't know that
because I keep it a secret but I love it
and I hope you love it as much as I do
so the reveal will be coming soon my
makeup line is going to launch in
October holy bejeezus we're getting
close and last announcement is about
merch I am working on hoodies right now
or fall I have some good ideas at my
sleep I've actually created two hoodies
but if you guys have any specifics about
hoodies that you want comment down below
I create the merch for you guys and I
like to wear it a lot too but I like to
know your input and like what you guys
want so be sure and comment down below
what you want to see this fall um it
doesn't have to be about hoodies gonna
be anything but let me know and that is
it also I've been letting if you haven't
noticed already my subscribers kind of
take over the subscribe song you guys
have taken the song as your own and I
really appreciate that cuz I love this
song and it's so catchy and it gets
stuck in all of our heads all day long
so I asked you guys you know to send me
a version of you singing the song to
larlie los angeles at gmail.com
and we got loads of beautiful voices and
funny voices and really cute children
singing it so I'm gonna be incorporating
that and videos and singing it myself
sometimes I miss you guys and I know you
guys love my voice I know you want to
hear me sing it so hope you guys are
enjoying that and it gives me a way to
give back to my subscribers without
further ado I will go ahead and jump
right into the video here now we're
talking about the foundation so this
what it looks like it is a compact
foundation and it says age 20s ethnic
calm cover packed so we're gonna be
testing out this foundation I got it off
Amazon and it was $29.99 but it came
with two compacts it came with the one
in the compact and then it came with a
refill so you get two for your buck for
30 bucks but uh I dropped the one that
was in the compact and it like shifted
and then I ended up rubbing it and
playing with it and it like water
droplets came out of it it was really
weird moment and I was like oh my God my
whole review is ruined because I've
already like crushed the product and
then I realized down in the very bottom
of the box that came in you get a whole
second one so I was like oh my video has
been saved so with that being said the
video must go on I looked up the
information about it and it said
the h20 white latte foundation is best
suited for fair to medium to golden skin
types so I figured that was Meeks I feel
like I'm pretty golden kind of medium
through here it is wrinkle smoothing
brightening it has sunscreen in it it's
a moisturizing dewy compact filled with
foundation that is infused with essence
this product includes 68% holler onyx
serum in hyaluronic acid also helps you
retain moisture into your skin and a
whole 2,000 times smarter ways so if you
have oily skin this foundation may not
be for you welcome to your forever
foundation it's what it says on there
well okay does not clog your pores does
not require a lot of touch-ups and is
not cakey it feels very cakey whenever I
dug my finger into it so that is just a
quick boring rundown on it if I hope you
guys aren't sleeping on my video yet
let's get to the fun part and try it out
first I'm going it to put on one heck of
a blot this is just a little bit of a
primer from soap &amp;amp; Glory I really like
this one it's pore filling and if we're
gonna use like kind of a thicker
foundation I feel like the best bet is
to give it give it a good run by filling
in our pores first I'm just gonna like
putty in a poor situation I broke out
from all the sunscreen I used on my trip
to he came with a sponge
I typically hate sponges like this but
I'm gonna use it because I'm gonna use
it okay just know that so I'm gonna take
the foundation uh I'm gonna mess up how
pretty it is it's like a marble marble
foundation over here look at that and it
still holds huh like rubbing it around
nicely it still holds its marble esque
it feels it looks so white oh okay we're
gonna disregard the color because this
is not my color and it's just not
working out even though it says from
medium to golden skin tones and it feels
so in like wet very very wet on my skin
and very icy cold oh and I'm shooked as
to how far a little bit is going
oh my god this let's rub it in really
well and see if some of the whiteness
will fade although it's just getting
whiter the more I rub it in oh that's
super weird I feel like I've done this
before with Korean skincare like I order
the darker shade that's for golden in
tones and it just is not so I'm just
gonna rub it in it feels super it's just
interesting at how wet it feels if I can
explain that and it feels um those
powdery though whenever I get it on my
skin it doesn't feel heavy but it feels
like almost it's like water beads are
dispersing on your face I hope I'm
describing that in a good way
super pill on me but it's not as bad as
it was also there's absolutely no
coverage and I mean no coverage like
literally it just looks like it lined my
skin and did absolutely nothing else
which is a little bit disappointing
because it's not called a CC or BB cream
it's called a foundation and it does I
mean the one that I messed up is very
thick like a foundation it feels good on
my skin I mean I just don't understand
what the point of this product is
because just looking at myself in this
mirror I just have no coverage it feels
like maybe I just put a powdery
moisturizer on and lightened my skin
this is such a buzz I'm so disappointed
let me just try to add a little bit more
even like patting it on it's just a
little bit but it's turning ghostly
isn't that interesting how it actually
is pretty darn dark in the container the
more you pat it whiter it gets
it has a little more coverage the more I
put on my skin it also feels a lot
heavier the more I put on my skin Tasos
turning so white compared to like what's
in the compact I guess like the white
serum is taking over I don't know like
whenever you just touched the brown it
turns so light it's very interesting
okay so this is gonna be like the
weirdest stuff have her try he's also
looking the more I put on is looking
quite shiny and heavy versus this side
where I put just a smaller error this is
like a bus for me we disregard the color
which is kind of hard to do but if we
did the more I put on to get any
coverage it feels too heavy and it
doesn't look good it looks it looks cake
looks super cakey to me so the lighter I
put on it doesn't look so bad but it
doesn't do anything it has no cover so
there's no point in putting this
foundation on I'd rather just use a BB
cream than a heavy foundation like this
it's not good I think I need to stay
back from all Korean foundation products
because they kind of don't work out for
me
I tried take a swing down because no
like Korea Koreans get so creative and
have the coolest products ever and I
love to try out cool products you guys
know that but the foundation is just
don't working I mean I guess that should
have been my son whenever on the site is
that it works for fair skin medium skin
and golden skin how does one foundation
kind of work for all skins however that
create Korean the color-changing
foundation trying out with Jeffrey
actually did work out pretty well
so I actually loved that stuff overall
I'm not gonna recommend the foundation
to you guys actually was gonna do a wear
test on this if even it not being my
color I was gonna do a wear test but
it's already like a mess and it's just a
bust guys this was a flop this video was
up huh
now we know if you see this $30
foundation on Amazon and it's floating
around quite a lot you know the tea on
it you know the good-good
well that's it for this video I thought
it was gonna last longer and be better
but it's not I love you guys so much
thank you for being here and watching I
know I look a little odd
but I will see you in my next video and
I'll see you next video I'm gonna go
wash my face now okay guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
