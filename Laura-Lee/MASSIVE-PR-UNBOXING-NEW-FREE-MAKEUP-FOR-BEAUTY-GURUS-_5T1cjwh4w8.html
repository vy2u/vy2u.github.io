up what's up guys and welcome to our
channel I have these little eyelash
scissors in my hand right now because
well much on my address because I got up
open this box I have all of them open
bugs realize of course the first box I
want to start with and then open 70
minutes with you what we're doing today
today video is going to be me at doing a
PR unboxing for you guys and let's be
real I've never really done if you're
boxing on my main channel before I've
seen this floating around Manny and
toffee and a couple other youtubers to
them so I wanted to do it to you know
film this little PR boxing this is free
makeup youtubers get and a lot of people
say like oh you're so lucky to us we
makeup and I agree with that but I also
agreed that it takes a lot of hard work
to get to the point where you're at in
your career and people want to
essentially use you for free
advertisement but they want to itto send
that product to you so I didn't start on
my channel just uploading a video and
then all this stuff to start coming in
the mail it took years to get to the
point where I'm I just wanted to put
that in there so you kind of know a
little behind the scenes yes we get
loads of free makeup but as you
understand and return the business gets
free marketing and that's why they're
sending it over probably and maybe they
want us to have a special little treat
too and yeah so I'm going to start with
the lamb below we got a second box hello
sexy hi hi and so when oh the gloves
that are yes so many people love this
setting spray and I've been wanting to
try it actually meant to pick it up at
Sephora and I forgot so I guess I'm kind
of glad I did it because I got it now a
lot of people I know Geoffrey I think
Geoffrey is someone who puts it in his
fridge and it's just so cold and
relaxing on the skin relax wing puff a
weird word but this is just a makeup
setting spray let's do a spritz both a
mister is incredibly gentle on this and
I really like that about it the tatcha
oh it smells like cotton candy
the tatcha one is two and this is a
little close but what she looks like
yeah yeah yeah
thank you like a blow
I appreciate the stuff next I got about
some dose of colors hmm
so previous the new highlighters and oh
my good
Oh as I say someone has a warehouse I
only sent me ten of these but it's
actually one for each color okay I got
you Oh first we have the yellow one is
called milk and honey what the packaging
looks like and then that is the
highlighter it's super bright I think
this one is for the lighter skin tones
no this one's actually for a more medium
skin tone so interesting another one I'm
going to swatch for you is called gold
is the new black and there it is right
there it's kind of subtle on my skin
tone but very pretty and then we have
royal hotness and it is super bronze so
I will be using royal hotness as a
pretty eyeshadow Shea from me very
gorgeous though I just watched three out
of the six because y'all we got so much
stuff to go through this video will be
30 minutes long and girl I know I got
the time next up we got a package from
Urban Decay and it is the gift good
space so if you didn't know they're
coming out with face shape-shifter
collection and it is these little
pellets right here let's open them up
and have a look this one is the dark
contoured so this one for shade medium
dark and you have the powders on one
side and a mirror and then you flip it
up and you have your cream color
correction in a mirror and then it all
sandwiches together like that it feels
super heavy and luxurious here we have
light medium and then this one is the
powder and then the cream and this one
will be my skin tone personally and here
she is upside down next we got a pressed
Luminizer kind of feels a little bit
powdery super subtle so I don't know if
this supposed to be just a pressed
powder oh no this is just translucent
powder i was like this is powdery and
doesn't show up so she's a translucent
powder and act shit does break it
oh oh
I don't know what's happening it
actually feels really nice for a press
trances in powder and I'm excited to use
that next we got the liquid Aurora and
these was really cool I did do a sneaky
peeky of these and they look like just
mixer drops and they have an era death
and glow to it so if you want to get
your glow on let me show you that swatch
see it very subtle and it's just a mixer
drops you can mix in your primer
foundation and there is what that bottle
looks like then we have Urban Decay
Velvet Iser and it comes out of the UD
now this product right here just feels
like a kind of a Matt Jensen powder
which I'm super excited to see if it's
any good
after admit I'm kind of picky with my
translucent powders because like it's
just got to be right so I'll definitely
do a test out on that and then I got the
double ended brush to go with it which I
will be testing thank you so much urban
decay my girlfriend Ashley at Carr Los
Angeles I'm going to cheat out the level
of rudeness but YouTube's all about
being at home and broadcasting yourself

pigment is a little more it feels a
little more wet mercury is this silver
one at the bottom kind of pewter
actually and then there's the brown then
I got this cyber clear gloss which looks
iridescent but honestly once you get it
on your lid it just looks like a wet
