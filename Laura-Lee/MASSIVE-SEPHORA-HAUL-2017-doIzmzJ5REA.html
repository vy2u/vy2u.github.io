trying to crush this little knuckle ring
on a finger that's too fat for it Dave's
video is going to be a Sephora haul it's
been many moons since I've done a
Sephora ha and I recently did an order
it ordered a whole bunch of stuff that I
really wanted to try out and then um I
got some stuff and br-2 which I'll talk
about the end of the video that is new
at Sephora but I didn't buy it because
it was sent to me but if I wasn't sent
to me I totally 100% would have bought
it so I thought it'd be worth talking
about so I'm just looking I like
everything I got in PR I'm just picked
out a few items that I really would have
purchased but I was so I'm so grateful
people sent it to me let's go ahead and
jump into the video but right before we
do let's go ahead and sing a special
little song be sure and subscribe to my
channel
be sure and subscribe to my channel
before you leave subscribe Wow forget it
and don't forget to give this video
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video all right so the first item that I
picked up is something very special but
it's also something that I'm really late
on picking up this is the Louboutin
lipstick girl these came out so long ago
and I'm just now getting one I got just
nothing the shade nude of course I
bought the shade nude so let's open it
up together it's like in a casket
look at that I kind of don't want to use
it it's like out makeup collector's
items these are $90 of price which is
absolutely absurd but what else do you
expect the Louboutin and it looks like a
Christmas ornament I've never played
with one of these before
oh it's a red inside the lid this color
looks so pretty they are very heavy
filling in this metal packaging stop
someone with that shank them it was just
an interesting product on the site so I
really wanted to get it and I've been
eyeballing it for a long time my girl do
you need that hell no you don't need no
no no lipstick oh you're gonna get it
anyways so I finally got it and it's
fine I also picked up from Sephora
make no mistake foundation plus
concealer stick I thought it was
interesting because is a concealer in a
foundation mix in the one and I've had
the luck with foundation sticks lately I
don't know that this is a new product
okay I don't know there was a new Prada
but it did catch my eye on the website
so I was like let me try it out I hate
the plastic wrapping so this isn't shade
bamboo I totally get when there are
plastic so people won't because they
don't have you know cartons for these so
instead they just shrink wrap them in
plastic so people can't open all but
like other stuff comes in boxes to deter
me from opening I just washed on my hand
in the shade bamboo looks like it's
gonna be nice it feels a little bit
thick but damn that's some coverage
honey okay I'm really excited about this
and as you guys know the Sephora brand
makeup in Sephora is a little bit more
affordable so I'm really excited to test
that out next I picked up two items from
why is Elle I got to go to Marrakesh
within this year
got to learn so much about their brand
and that was really exciting for me and
yes I got to test out their foundation
aren't ready I got the shade before t
sand this is they're all ours foundation
it's got sunscreen in it supposed to be
just a very long wearing full coverage
matte foundation which girl that is
right up my alley comma name so I got to
try it out on the trip and it were so
beautiful on my skin on the trip I
really enjoyed it I didn't get to try
the concealer so I went ahead and picked
up the all ours concealers they kind of
go together let's see what shade I got
shade ivory and this because their other
shades just look I normally do shade
light and stray away from fair eye
breaks this is normally too light but
the other shades looked close this the
Hulk that might be too late
listen to me talk I haven't worn this at
all yet but if you can see that one
little swipe it's going a long way I'm
excited about how they should have had a
good run with my only thing it's like
it's not my shade because T is I'm on
vacation no my skin is really tan so
I'll probably keep that shade anyway so
my skin won't stay this tan for too much
longer
next I found another concealer that I
really want to try out is she a
concealer junkie yes she is this is the
Sephora
make no mistake oh it matches that's
right yeah and make no mistake
collection so I like the YSL collection
and then the Sephora collection but this
is their make no mistake high coverage
concealer I got shade sesame OH - let's
do a little swatch it comes in a little
squeezy tube it's interesting
oh she thick that came out like I don't
want to talk about it oh my god reminds
me the it cosmetics is so thick I'm
gonna be blending this down to my elbow
so that one little drop I might be too
thick for me but I'm gonna try this out
anyways and see what happens I'm excited
about this
it might be the worst thing that ever
happened to me or could be the best well
know till we try it okay
so I feel like I should do like a first
impression is trying those products out
together and then those two out together
I don't know something like that let me
get your juices flowing in the comment
section and you let me know how you want
me to test these products out next I
bought okay so vice our eye shadows are
very luxe eyeshadows and they're really
great and they sent me some before in
the past like little mini palettes and I
decided to take the plunge and buy the
Big Dawg
oh shoot it looks like I bought their
highlight in sculpt palette well I'm
happy about that too I just hit myself
in the face so hard I can't really use
that on my face or that on my face this
was expensive I can only use that and
these really unless I wanted to use as
eyeshadow and it looks patchy the swatch
ooh
but it's buttery on the skin I don't
know guys we'll see what happens with
this I'm kind of like Laura what did you
do girl she got all click happy on the
computer oh yeah really pigmented next I
bought let's see an a concealer and eye
shadow primer so I bought 3 concealers
this way it's supposed to be a concealer
eye shadow primer and one at this brand
I've never heard of but I saw on the
website so you know I've had a dabble
virtuous veil is what it's called let's
open her up oh it's sealed
I got be bright I remember they didn't
have a lot of shades in this if I am
correct on the website oh my god it's so
small I don't know why I like online oh
this thing was huge it's like a little
nugget in there with less you are more
so I get what they're already saying the
same girl don't go in with a heavy hand
less is more
this feels like it weighs a hundred
pounds and it looks like a little pad of
pebble I mean that's interesting right
look at that little nugget so how do we
open it it's lifting oh it slides it
slides it slides everyone we're good we
got it here is the concealer and Aki
should a primer as well so I'm going to
swatch on my hand and see what I think
very rich I'm very
it looks pretty it looks really pretty
not too thick it doesn't seem to give
them that much coverage which I'm a
little hesitant about that is a new
different product that I'm excited to
try it out okay next I bought if I broke
down and bought one of these crazy
expensive Natasha de Nona star palettes
either it's always fancy
never and my career used to Natasha de
Nonna eyeshadow I do have her primer
face primer and I like it a lot so I
thought maybe I would like this the
price point is outrageous it's a really
pretty color scheme about it but I don't
know if it's gonna work or not it should
we switch them let's watch something
it's really pretty
oh the matter velvet these aren't really
beautiful and I didn't want them to me
because now I have to buy more they're
really expensive um it looks like we
have like well I like a moon dust shade
that needs to be wet it's still so
pigmented I think that shadows just like
wrath about our super pigmented and
extremely high quality but I just feel
like the market it's hard to come out
with a palette this high and price
because there's so many eyeshadow
palettes out now and so many with such
good quality that you don't have to
spend this much money to get this good
of quality so I don't want to make you
guys feel like you need to buy this
palette but surely pretty I'm not gonna
lie on it it's pretty now we are
officially talking about products the
worst sent me NPR look you wanna do if
you guys didn't know um this video isn't
sponsored by manna for anything like I'm
just announcing it because most of you
already know I've already know so it's
all over the internet but anyways I am
on the precisely my brow pencil
packaging so if you buy any shade of the
precisely my brow pencil you get a
little me with you I'm so excited about
it I'm in Sephora and I'm on the
packaging and we're on a huge like tower
stand up front in the store and then in
August we're actually on the gone
so it's a whole big shebang and a couple
other influencers do it with me and I am
so excited for this so if you do pick up
my favorite brow pencil in the world the
precisely my brow pencil I use shade for
it by the way be sure to tag me girl I
need to know or even if you don't pick
it up I'm not trying to force you to buy
this if you don't pick it up and you're
just in Sephora snap a pic of it I'm so
excited to see you guys see it it just
makes my heart warm and I'm so honored
for this opportunity thank you so much
benefit I'm just like this is something
that I'll remember for the rest of my
life and it's such a special moment to
me thanks as the new Pat McGrath
lipsticks which I'm really excited about
antidote we have make Minute Men Amy
make make mine Amy and oweme oweme it's
the one I just wash on my hand everybody
is raving about these and whenever I saw
them in the packaging they have like
this velvety look to them and they have
really nice packaging as well but most
of the time I grab stuff it's like
laughing actually and I was praying that
when she came lipsticks like we would
step it up and she totally did
I have a warm on my lips yet so I still
have to test them out there but I want
to swatch a few shades for you guys
they're super super super pigmented they
just look a little bit drying in the
packaging but whenever you do it there
actually have a little bit of a sheen to
it they're not that matte if you can
tell so I'm really really really excited
about these I have a bunch of them
actually this is 1995 mr. great year
I couldn't help it you guys know I
couldn't help it I'm really excited for
this this is the Urban Decay
troublemaker mascara so it delivers
super so it's super fat thirteen point
seven times the last volume and it's
high intensity back and it's sex proof
Wonder all these masks era is so sexual
nowadays that it's like clear and then
it has the hollow on the inside or like
rainbow looking it says troublemaker
let's take a peek at that brush hey it's
like spiky I don't know why that was
gonna be a fat fluffy brush see that's
like a little spiky spike I'm so excited
to see how it works out next up this was
sent to me by I G K this is called jet
lag it's an invisible dry shampoo and I
played with some of their hair stuff
before really liked it so I'm excited
about the invisible dry shampoo I'll
smell it
it smells like nothing it's really
invisible two things from fresh
this was my lifesaver on my vacation
this is the sports treatment lip and
it's for your face and eye area it has
SPF 30 in it and protected my lips so
well against the sun and it like sticks
to your lips so if you're on the water
it doesn't come off it keeps your lips
moisturize it you can also like buff it
around areas they're a little sensitive
and it will really stick and protect
them from the Sun definitely is a
multi-use Sun product and it is a gym if
you are in the Sun or going on a
vacation or anything like that
and then I haven't tried this yet but
I'm dying to is the sugar face polish oh
my god I want to try this so bad
their skin care line is really nice but
the sugar face polish I'm just like I
opened it it looks like brown sugar in
there and just looks so good on the face
so I really want to try this out as well
and that is ever my humongo Sephora haul

much stuff but that's it I love you guys
