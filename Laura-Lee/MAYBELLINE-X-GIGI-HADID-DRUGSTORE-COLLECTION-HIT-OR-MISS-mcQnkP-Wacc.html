oh okay okay okay
she said he does involve enough hey guys
what's up and welcome to my channel
first things first let me address really
quick in my last few videos you may have
noticed me talking weirdest because I
have a big old sir right here on my
mouth tough like this and trying to move
my teeth too much down here because it
hurts so if you see me not making a lot
of facial expressions it's because I'm
trying to limit those that's the pain
inside my mouth and I'm gonna film a few
videos today so unfortunately it's gonna
be like a week's worth of videos maybe
like it's annoying I know I'm sorry and
I know it's distracting and I know it's
like what is going on with her but just
letting you know life happens and I also
have a red patch right here because I
was hugging the kitten and sometimes
cats make me well pup as much as I love
them anywho that's all the tea I got on
me um also this is a new merger hoodie
see a little black so this is a black
and broad rate at capita if you can see
it sparkly black thread it so it has
like bits of sparkle in it it's so cute
and this is a crop hoodie
it has cat hair all over it what else is
new anyway so yeah so today's video I'm
all over the place I always am that's
why we come to this channel to enjoy my
all over the place Ness today's video is
going to be on the Gigi Hadid X
Maybelline collection there are so many
pieces to this collection my bling did
send it to me in PR this video isn't
sponsored they just sent the makeup over
in PR though uh so I opened the PR and I
was like why did I think that there was
just like one piece of this there's like
literally so many pieces to this
collection that I'm gonna go over and do
a tutorial and swatch for you guys to
see what's worth the wild and what is it
so hope you guys are excited for that
before we get started we're gonna sing a
little song
um I did a terrible job and I didn't
snap so that was a flop anyway so we're
gonna go ahead and jump right into the
start off with to what I think is BB
Creams this is the Maybelline New York
oh shoot this is a tinted primer base so
they have medium deep and then light
medium I'm gonna use the light medium I
think the packaging on this whole
collection is super pretty it's like a
nude pink and then it has holographic
and then a white has her signature over
here I think it's really pretty in sleek
so this has a tinted primer but if you
can see it kind of looks like a
foundation almost just take it yet 57
brush and oh this is light medium which
if you can see it has quite a lot a tint
to it I don't know why I thought this
was like a foundation or something but
it is not it feels like a foundation
this is a little strange I don't not
like it though I'm just saying it's got
a lot of color to it so yeah I think it
looked a lot more tan right now I think
it's a lot of color on my skin with that
being said now there is no foundation
with the kit so I'm gonna go ahead and
apply some foundation and concealer and
I'll be right back alright first I'm
gonna share with you the big kit which
so this is the big key right here and
the unicorn to the kit looks like this
it is the holo and then the kit is the
nude with the holo writing on it
and it's like an airplane because this
is a travel kit so with that being said
what comes in it is the blush bronzer
highlight a colossal mascara for
eyeshadows blush brush eyeshadow brush
and then some cream lipsticks over here
and it also has a nice mirror in it and
I really like that I think I saw them
advertising like her on a plane using it
so that's if you travel a lot this is
the kit for you I think it's pretty I
personally just this is personal again
this is in like a statement I'm just
saying I don't use stuff like this
whenever I travel I just I just tend to
pack my own makeup but I think it's
pretty I'm actually gonna try out this
stuff today so she has like four I
should upon us this coming out this is a
warm tone palette I personally don't
care for how teeny teeny teeny tiny
these pans are versus how big of a space
there is in the palace I feel like they
couldn't make the pans bigger and then
you have a nice bigger base shade which
I do like that and then this is the cool
Toma version it's the exact same size
it's just cool tone colors and warm tone
colors but they're just so tiny and I
feel like there's like a lot of nice
space in here they could have extended
them and I'll show you because they're
like the same size as these but the
colors are so tiny and easy so again
here is another warm tone cool tone
situation this is the more cool tone one
right here it's called East Valley and
then this one's called a Pacific Coast
Highway so these are named after
California areas which is kind of cute I
have obviously you guys know I'm a
sucker for warm tones so I'm kind of
digging this more tone palette a lot
right here oh my alters hurting do you
guys see that yeah it's kind of gross I
know it's really gross actually
these are just like the city mini
pallets by Maybelline they've already
come out with it looks like they just
switched up some colors really pretty
colors mind you I think they're both
really pretty and changed the packaging
to the Gigi Hadid packaging so that is
the rundown on the eyeshadows I think
we'll get started with an eye look I
kind of want to tap into this one
because I see a lot
good transition shades versus this one
who really I mean I guess you could use
the purple but it has a lot of shimmer
in it as a transition shade so I want to
tap into this one and use like these two
colors first what you think just like
I'm actually gonna tap into the pink
color right here this is a m57
3 brush I'm just gonna pop it right into
the crease kind of going back and forth
back and forth with the color oh these
are so pigmented look at that yeah that
looks really nice like lots of color is
coming off next I'm gonna go in it with
the more brown shade and r39 brush yeah
these have a lot of pigmentation they
feel super creamy and nice they don't
feel dry and dusty so that is a good
sign Maybelline really did that Gigi
girl I see you
like we have a ma di I'm gonna go in
with this brown shade next and the same
r39 brush a lot of color comes off
whenever you tap into it so maybe going
with a light hand oh I keep thinking
there's a mirror here but there are
there's a mirror in the big pallet I'm
gonna pop it right there in that crease
and I just have a tiny bit of color on
my brush because since the color is so
bold and dark I want to get crazy with
it and make a mess on my eye and so I'm
trying to keep it on the tip of the
brush and really work it into that
crease I'm also gonna push some right
there in that outer corner of this color
so pretty
it's just a touch fall out which is
absolutely normal nothing extreme and
I'm gonna go back in with that first
blender we use and just soften up the
edges
i swatched all three of the shimmers in
the warm tone palette this pink color is
calling my name they also have a
beautiful bronze and like a highlight
color super pretty
I went ahead and smart some of the
colors in the cooler tone palette and
again they are really really pigmented
and pretty this pinky color screaming at
me right now you can see that purple
matte on my thumb I did dampen the pink
color a little bit because it felt
slightly powdery and I just didn't want
a lot of fall out I feel like the color
looks super soft and not really poppy on
my eye so I'm gonna pick up a little bit
of the gold and put it on top with like
the pink color just it's beautiful it's
just super soft and isn't really popping
so I put a little bit of gold on top and
I think that helped it like intensify it
she came out with a nude and black
eyeliner which is genius because I love
that for the waterline and then she came
out with this liner pin which I already
slosh and it dries shiny as most you
guys know I don't like shiny liner it's
like I hate the shiny eyeliner I just do
like so this one dried shiny and also I
don't know if you guys can see but it's
feathered like a lot it made a mess on
my hand so that scares me to death I'm
not gonna put this on my eye I just
don't want to ruin that I look I'm sorry
guys I just even trying to out on my
hand it was a flop so I don't like the
liner I just go ahead and tell you I've
worked with liners for a long time and I
know what I like and I know what I don't
like I'm going to take the highlight
shade and highlight the brow bone and
inner corner of the eye
alright now added some liner and now I'm
gonna share with you guys some first
they repackage the mascaras this is C
fiber mascara now they were packaged one
of my fevers from Maybelline and this is
the lash sensational mascara and it's
super gorgeous repackaged and I love
this I want to show you the little C
that one super nice I'm gonna go ahead
and apply this to my upper lashes
how much I love this mascara I was just
putting it on and I have really really
really straight down growing lashes and
that's cuz wear false lashes all the
time which I'm going to apply some
anyways because but if you can see it
kind of lifts them a good bit compared
to what they are I think that this
mascara is just awesome I love it you
know what I love you feel like I feel
like I put all that brown and and worked
so hard to build up all that dark brown
I feel like it just kind of faded down I
don't know it's just not as bold as I
thought I don't know what happened there
I don't know why it went away i plied my
lashes and now i'm going to add a little
bit of the brown and then a little bit
of the darker brown color to my lower
lash line
I'm gonna take the pencil liner and nude
and pop it into my waterline and now I'm
gonna add some of the lash sensational
to my lower lashes we're gonna top a
little bit into this palette first I'm
gonna go in with the bronzy shade and
bronze up my skin I'm gonna take am 105
brush oh okay
the there is a lot of fun I should tell
it and then it's kind of hard to get
your brush in that bronzer because I got
a lot of blush on my brush now geez
lowly's
mmm it's pretty on the skin though it's
a little harsh but it's pretty yeah it's
pretty also something I don't like I
don't like the particular way they have
them place on the palette because it's
really hard to get my brush in there I
prefer to use you know not a big bronzer
brush either like a pretty medium sized
brush I'm just saying when I do my
makeup that's how I do it so that would
get on my nerves real quick the bronzer
is pretty though I give it to him for
blush this is a super hot pink color I'm
going to use it for the six of the video
again it has a lot of kick up and it's
so hard to get my brush into that little
base strip of color but it's very
pigmented it looks pretty on it's a
little bit pink for me but I think it's
pretty I like mini pants like little
squares I think it's a little easier to
dip it down into just my personal
preference though now for fun I'm gonna
go in with a highlight shade it's super
easy to get the brush in the highlight
shade this is a bigger square so it's
just easier and let's have a look
my balloon always makes a good
highlighter this one's a little bit
pinky blushy oh it's so pretty
yeah the highlight on this thing is
blinding very pretty I went ahead and
swatched all the lipstick she came out
with the packaging looks like this these
are really pretty actually like every
single color like literally I think
every color beautiful this is my
favorite red out of the Reds and then
this is probably my favorite new to
other nudes so my favorite red is called
Lani la la and I and my favorite nude is
called McCall and then the lid to the
packaging that looks like this on every
color so here are four of them just to
see them in the packaging if you guys
want to look let me show you the other
two because there is a total assistance
to she came out with lots of Reds who
doesn't love a good red I'm gonna go
ahead and use Lani I feel like my look
just turned out so do truly Nellie that
we can do a little pop of color on the
lips
that's pigmented red
she also has two new liquid highlighters
this one is a light one and then this
one's a bronzy gold I'm already a sucker
for this bronzy gold color I think it's
so pretty and then it comes in the tube
packaging that looks like this one is
light and then one is bronzy gold I
think it's so so pretty I did the powder
highlight today as you guys saw I think
it's not too crazy but I still think
it's somewhat blinding and really
beautiful okay so let me head over and
tell you guys my my final thoughts on
the lipsticks I think they're all
beautiful
I tell thoughts on the eyeshadow
palettes I like them a lot I think
they're very pigmented I feel like the
color it's like wearing off a little bit
little off her eye wear it so maybe not
long-lasting like I feel like the Browns
already gone I don't know what's
happening there but I think they're
really beautiful they're super
affordable and the color schemes are
really pretty
I honestly and just being dead off so
you guys like I don't care for these I
think these are a little gimmicky
looking I don't I would rather get this
just let me put that way I like this
better than this
um and the travel palette I think the
quality of the blush bronzer and
highlight and they are nice I just don't
see myself using this you will have to
weigh it out for yourself and see like
will you use this would you use a travel
kit I like them the bronzing primer I
like the pencil liners it didn't like
the liquid liner so there were some
hit-and-miss products in this collection
but overall I think it's a great
collection and congrats Gigi and
congrats Maybelline I hope this video
