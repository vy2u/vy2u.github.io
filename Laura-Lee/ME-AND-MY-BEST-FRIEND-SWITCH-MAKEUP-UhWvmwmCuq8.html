blush yeah I did keep digging keep where
I give you so pretty here minerals love
those blushes these are really beautiful
they're so soft and creamy well this is
pretty but she's not stunning oh yeah

actually use like on that foundation
chain or you like literally look like a
Geisha and I'm like actually here for it
though I know it's like so soft and
elegant looking for whatever reason dude
in the reminds me of like um like Marie
Antoinette kind of Titans tell me it was
like such light foundation yes you're
right you're right actual color is great
on me so I'm not sure how you're using
this well where's what's a contour sweet
little variable I'm contouring and I
know like smear mud on my cheek you use
too much it's super me yeah yeah
you're so Orange like yeah where's the
would you give me a contour yeah no way
I just used the makeup geek bronzers
we're gonna use a dark leader in Los
Angeles yeah I'm using the darker one
now yeah yeah use mine dramatic product
mani yeah yeah oh my gosh
see not so bad what do you mean it's so
bad
you shade number six yeah you should
never said oh my god okay to use this is
about to be real Marie Antoinette
because you know why I use a4 and on the
light hand sometimes a3 I use a six
where and a 5nf or o g4 mostly that's
like I was think that was interested
black yeah and look at my roots like
this is about or my memories my hair oh
there's just some setting powder I used
to a you go uh powder huh
I can't wait to see you with those brows
on that's my girl ideas here's the thing
you have brown hair so I have to like
make an eyebrow out of
a pencil so you about let's see the tea
and I don't know you don't I'm just like
filling in yeah and I have such dark
hair exactly so everyone you let me and
you're like do you dye your hair
I always thought may need is really this
like I knew you and one day we were
sitting I think on my couch that's all
gray hairs come out of the side I was
like he doesn't diet this is how darkest
natural hair is that is dark I'm tired
yet is you like jet black hearing loss
actually it is pretty friggin it's
pretty dark as dark as its own nation
can we go eat Oreos which is such a good
highlight whoa so she's like actually
what's cool is I had it was like this
like this such a golden undertone looks
so much better on like a bronzer scale
like die for that one in the ombre one
oh yes I use a harbor one and I can
still use it and pile it on it it
doesn't look like too dark on me which
is really nice I'm really trying to look
sickening here you see black is the
night sky you look like a 1d oh my god
so why in dark this is what you look
like look at me and realize this is what
you look like when you come out and this
is you look good I look fucking good
precisely
yeah that's so funny I like this broken
so so funny
okay okay no looks good
damn you pull out the barrel roll for
today I did you did that's not brought
you do this is actually the guy do we
like it or isn't he to be chopped
no no this is different like it
it is unique like you could always do
like a bulk your end that was a fakest
cry I'm gonna take the coloured raine
Beauty rust pellet take how much was
this okay do it's really weird like for
example this later
we have brands now
yes and it does it's pretty bizarre to
me when brands like do they pull the
pads like this think they pull it where
it's like so much more expensive but it
doesn't need to be this expensive yeah
like I don't understand the cost of
making makeup yep that's great there's
six shades it's like I think 30
something dollars that's what I'm
talking about no they're not like like
these pins are tiny their service or
like that's what 14 chase for 42 it's
kind of like a little trick in the trade
whenever you make the exact same palette
like this is literally the same as soap
culture prison the same actual component
palette it's same pan sizes so they can
order the exact same cardboard palette
hundreds of thousands of times and just
put a do cover on it which therefore
they're ordering of the component is
extremely cheap because they're ordering
so many yes Kylie just ordered the same
component she just put a different oil
in that thing yeah and so it makes it
twenty thousand times cheaper than
making a custom palette every single
time and like changing your pounds up
take your subscribers to the all like
together we just go to the lab together
and make it together like see this is
how it's done and these are decisions
that you have to make I really wish I
could and I wish I can like literally
like show them like the order numbers of
like this is why I had to price it this
way because yes it's like trying to
still make a good profit off the makeup
line if you don't have a good profit
then that's the only product you'll go
with and that's a wrap exactly so it's
like scary you just keep trying to come
out with product I think that we've done
a really good job at trying our best to
keep things as affordable as possible
yes I agree and I know there was cake
back on my prices for cat's pajama and
in the future I am working really hard
to make decisions that you know help you
guys in prices like I'm doing the best I
can and I did I did hear that you know
and I didn't yeah so don't think it was
ignored and I was just like whatever
that definitely wasn't the case yeah
first you're insane I've always liked I
feel like because I've always kept my
collabs really relatively like fair
price yeah that's the same same thing
goes for my brand it's like
we don't want like I don't want a
fucking Homer to touch people I got
something I want do you know what I mean
I'm trying like you we try our best like
make it like as cost efficient as
possible absolutely it's like oh there's
always some things like I always like I
want to bring up and talk about you're
like doing it too it's like yeah we both
are kind of relating yeah no definitely
it's it's what we do now is Lily what me
and dick we talk about all the time
because you know we know what we're
working on
mm-hmm it's literally like not kidding
like we literally talk like almost once
a day about yeah at this point yeah okay
how's this how's this how can we do that
which I was blending really nice yeah I
used that actually what's so funny is I
use that power and underrated makeup
short my products they're underrated and
I pulled out and you didn't know what it
was
you see what I mean yeah I mean people
and I was like what is this I've also
never used that because I remember when
there was like a colouring pod that was
really popular you didn't use it I
didn't use it your heart like the heart
one the heart one right okay so this is
what I'm saying
yeah like I get frustrated because it's
like that palette I think was like 50 60
there's like 60 bucks worth like 12
shades you know wasn't it yes but no I
didn't really ever see anyone reading
them to really did it but I got a brand
new India as well okay that's what's
frustrating color sultry oh you do the
whole cook crease moment everything
thinking that you're gonna be out kind
of do I put too much shade down on my
lid and I just have a clean off thank
you and good night
sure yeah that's fine just so you know
look ugly but you know what we're just
gonna go ahead and bra you're kind of
fucking it out Laura no you sass me I
hesitated doing it for a minute I won't
do that
the shades are almost too big they are
fuck

intricate than my eye so I'll give you
that I'm not satisfied I mean you look
