video and my apartment is at going here
because we've taken so much stuff out of
this room so hopefully the video isn't
too echoey I'm so it's like so
bittersweet I've come so many videos and
grew my channel and had created my
makeup line and did so much stuff in
this apartment and we're leaving it
we're moving into our home and I am just
so excited about it
bittersweet memories on another note I
want to let you guys know that I am
doing a huge giveaway it is a 21 winner

buttload of makeup and then one winner
is gonna win a MacBook Pro so there's 21

in the description box if you guys want
to Interop to do is subscribe and
comment down below on that video super
easy to enter and last thing is about
what we're reviewing hello today we are
gonna be reviewing something super
exciting and actually this is my very
first review from storybook cosmetics
that's the name of it es storybook
cosmetics so Mean Girls and Paramount's
let them create the burn book I shoulda
pellet and I'm a huge huge huge fan of
Mean Girls I'm pretty much quote stuff
from that movie in my everyday life gave
like literally when I hear movie so I'm
super excited to review this this is the
burn book isn't I should have palette so
this is the you know carton for it
slides on it and just let you guys know
it came in this super cute storybook
cosmetics velvet bag
oh my god I'm doing the thing again
where I tell you guys about the product
before we sing the song I keep jumping
in my videos too quick so let's rewind
back and sing our special little song
and now we can go ahead and jump right
into the video okay as I was saying back
to what I was saying this is the you
know carton it came in a nice velvet bag
that looks like this it has the
storybook cosmetics logo on it it's
plain on the back and then this is the
actual burn of book palette it looks
just like the burn book it's super thick
and it looks like pages on the side and
then
opens up like that boom it has a nice
mirror in it and here is a look at all
the shades let's see it has 12 shades
and it looks like there's some really
pretty colorful shades and of course
they have names of the shades that are
from the movie you can't sit with us
girl cool mom
yes Amy Palmer let's go ahead and swatch
this palette and then we'll move on from
there so I'm just gonna stand up so we
can get a straight shot of these
swatches they all felt really nice the
green one felt the green and the blue
actually felt the most creamy of all the
formulas but the other ones were super
pigmented and swatch very well actually
this one swatch really nicely as well so
you get a pretty cool arrangement of
colors you get greens and blues and hot
pinks in a nice really nice matte white
this one swatch pretty darn well for a
mouth white and you also get a nice
transition shade which I'm so thankful
for Oh as I say look you can see my
light right there hello my secret self
as I always say swatches are always good
and fun but we don't wear eyeshadow on
our arms that's not the reason we buy
pallets weird on my arms down the street
we buy eye shadow palettes to wear them
on our eye so it's now time to see how
the eyeshadow palette performs on our
eyes not on our arms first I'm gonna go
in with you can't sit with us which I
adore the name of that shade it's so
freaking cute
I'm gonna take my m5 at 7/3 brush such a
good little peachy shade look a little
picture cane and apply that right here
in the crease
oh that's pigmented if you can see it's
like kinda super pigmented I just went
in with a really heavy hands I didn't
know but now I just educated myself on I
have powder down here because I just
touched up my concealer it had been on
for way too long and it needed a little
bit of love and care I know see shadows
as far as the first map that I've dipped
into does not have a lot of Fallout
which is nice
it barely has any kick up whenever you
swatch your brush and it's um
enjoying that I love do they name at
this pink shade Wednesday because girl
on Wednesdays we wear pink and I'm not
wearing pink right now because it's a
Thursday I'm going to take Wednesday on
our 39 brush the pink has just a little
bit more kick up but it's nothing to
call home about be concerned also it's
an extremely pigmented eye barely tucked
into it so I'm going to tap off some
excess on the back of my hand and now I
want to push that pink right there in
that outer corner and then blend it out
then take a why 15 which is just a clean
blender and just soften up those outer
edges to make sure it's not harsh I'm
now gonna take she doesn't go here hello
right here don't you guys love how I was
like oh my god that there's a transition
shame and use that transition should I
use more so that you can't sit with us
which is also transition shade I love a
good peachy color to put down especially
if you're gonna do a pinkish look and by
the way I'm using the same r39 brush for
she doesn't even go here um like two
years ago Tyler went as Damian it for
Halloween to a Halloween party
he Wednesday mian he like wore the
hoodie and were like a sign that says
that you can't sit with us and everybody
was like gagging like it was so funny
I'm sorry fine picture which honestly I
don't even know if I have a picture of
him dressed like that God knows I hope I
do I'm next gonna take Regina George
which is a pink shade with like a little
bit of a golden reflux to it I'm gonna
hit it with a little bit of mac fix+ I
hit all my shimmers with mac fix+ it's
just what I do
it makes them stick down better and just
makes any shimmer I'm sorry I think I
said I hit oh my Matt I definitely met
all my first I don't wet my matte
eyeshadows ever ever ever and I'm just
gonna pack this color on to my eyelid it
did take a couple layers of this color
which is pretty normal with a lighter
shade like this this look really
beautiful next I'll take a blender and
right there but there's a harsh line I
like to just blend it out you can even
get a little bit I'm gonna get a little
bit the pink and maroon shade on the tip
of the brush just kind of buff it right
there I'm gonna go in with a a flat
brush like this and dip it is she
doesn't even go here
and I'm going to kind of line my upper
line to define it especially it right up
in here next I'm gonna pop on some Miami
by Lily lashes these are some of my
favorites for the lower lash line I'm
gonna mix these two shades first of all
pilot
this and then I'll paya this one a
really close and tight to the lower
lashline I'm gonna use the M 408 brush
and just start applying that hot hot
pink color now if you don't like such a
bold color as this you could definitely
go with it you can't sit with us which
was more of the peachy transition shade
that I used and in case you guys are
wondering even tell you the name of this
brush oh oh it's the a BH brush number
20 and it's just a little flat top and
this is what I'm gonna take she doesn't
even go here and just really get in
there girl I'm just gonna get in there
okay oh you guys love my face isn't like
whenever I do my okay now I'm gonna tag
I'm gonna take this gigi hadid eggs of
Maybelline which this review it's coming
very soon on my channel so hang tight
for that this is the liner in black
okay so I'm actually not gonna use this
money is my provoker liner because I
needed the nude one and I already packed
my nude Gigi Hadid one I've been loving
nude lately in the waterline it just
opens up my eyes a little more I go
through these things from like I'm
obsessed with black in the waterline
assessed with nude in the waterline I
just can't pick now I'm gonna go in with
the l'oreal lash paradise at mascara and
I am going it to apply it to my lower
lashes I'm gonna have these Edgar Allan
Poe black rock oh shoot these black rose
brushes I want you guys to know like cuz
then what breaks in your house you can
beat the breaks off of them with this
brush it's like still metal something
really hard okay these are like
heavy-duty brushes
okay I'm gonna use them today for a
bronzer and blush there's a flat top
kabuki one there's a rounded taper one
there's another less tapered but more
round at one and then there's an angled
one there so so so beautiful the very
dark mysterious and I feel like these
are there's like so heavy I can't
imagine these being like an everyday
brush cuz they're just like extremely
weighted but I'm gonna take the round at
kabuki one and do Bronto with it anyways
I just feel like they're more of a
collector's item but hey actually it's
it's super soft the handle I'm not gonna
lie is a little awkward cuz it's so
heavy like these are so luxe feeling I
believe I bought myself these before cuz
I bought the ones I believe that we
would like the snow white collection I
had the green handle and I was in
reviewing but I hadn't gotten around to
it I thought well now is the perfect
time right it is awkward a hold I'm not
gonna like I feel like I'm like being
weird over here with it but again at the
same time I don't play these are
everyday maker brushes and I feel like
they're more so a collector's item
so next I'm going to apply a little bit
that was hoola bronzer by the way I just
make it forever blushes and you guys
know
but I'm gonna mix these two guys I just
oh this is pretty blush I mean the brush
has worked nice I'm not gonna lie like
they're really pretty do I dare apply
this hot pink lip color I didn't even
know I had this I thought it was packed
and I was just sitting in this makeup
bag so I'm kind of like I think I got
apply is that gonna be too much who
cares
this is Rio by abh I'm about to ply Rio
guys ooh I always do a new lip so I
might as well yellow that word is out of
style and I should never say that again
okay my party people that is the last
video in my and that is it so this is my
very first story about cosmetic palette
I've ever played with and I think it's
stunning I think it performs great on
the eyes some of the colors were just a
little bit drier than others overall
like they still performed really well
and I know different colors take
different formulas to create especially
since I'm in the creation of makeup
myself but no these are super nice I
especially like their matte eyeshadows I
think they're my eyes shadows have like
a wild amount of pigment and they blend
it really really nicely so I give this
video I give this video a thumbs up well
I hope you give this video a thumbs up I
give this palette a thumbs up the
brushes are a little bit hard to work
with because the handles heavy but I
mean they're really nice and they're
really soft and I mean they blend it out
my makeup I think they're more of a
collector's item so I'll leave that for
you to decide on but yeah the burden
book isn't a plus I love it thank you
guys so much for watching and I have a
couple videos actually have a couple
videos pre filmed in this apartment so
there'll be a few more videos that go up
and then off to my new home to start
filming and I love you guys so much
