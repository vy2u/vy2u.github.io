channel today's video is going to be me
girl I have a platter of heaven I'm
gonna mix together a pump out of each
foundation that I have the only
foundations I won't be mixing in is my
stick foundations cuz I would have to
like chop off a piece and I literally
have almost think it was 30 foundations
right here I'm about to try out
drugstore and the highest high-end we
have Tom Ford down to elf we're gonna
mix them together we're gonna test them
out and then I'll do like a wear test
throughout the day I have my little
camera to do that with I'll probably do
one or two check-ins excited for this
video this is like definitely an
experiment definitely a video that's
going around and I haven't really
watched uni of them because I don't want
to know that outcome and like what
happens and I don't really know how they
did it but I'm just gonna do one pump of
each into this little Bowl and I'm
really excited
I love experiments especially with
makeup we're about to get a little weird
today but I think it would be cool just
to see what happens I mean there's so
many formulas out there and there's men
hydrating long wearing BB cream well I
don't have any BB creams have like
actual foundations near but we'll see
what happens anyways I hope you guys are
excited with the video I'm gonna sing
the subscribe song and then we're gonna
get to mixing up donations be sure and
subscribe to my channel and now let's go
ahead and jump into the
okay so let's begin mixing foundations
I'm gonna switch us over to the vlog
camera so you guys can mix with me we'll
do a little fast motion cuz now like mix
I'm excited and I'm gonna have to take
off the makeup that I have on by the way
because you know let's do it baby okay I
have like this makeshift so you guys can
like see the bowl have it kind of tilted
towards ya
so shall we begin we'll start with elf
all right guys we have it all mixed
together I'm now gonna take a mixer all
right so now I'm gonna just mix it all
together and then I'm going to go back
to the oh my god the color looks kind of
nice and then I'm gonna go back to the
main camera and we're gonna applies to
our face I don't know why I thought this
was gonna make up so much foundation it
did make it have some foundation for
like five people maybe like three or
four actually but in new I didn't make
it that much how was scares gonna be
super wasteful but it's actually I mean
not terrible I guess because I put like
a dot from each brand it looks like a
nice foundation oh my gosh we had so
many different textures and all in here
so there's a close-up of what it looks
like
so now the exciting part is I'm gonna
remove my makeup a bond and we're gonna
apply this to the face oh my god what if
it's amazing
all right makeup okey-dokey artichokey
I'm just gonna put on a facial primer so
I'm doing this like I would do my makeup
any day I'm just gonna use a little bit
of these for Sally drops crying unicorn
hard to go around the eyebrows I
probably do my foundation and then put
my brows on bitch enough to work around
it today and the lips I coulda just took
off I'm just gonna take off the lips oh
I'm going to take my mixing bowl and I'm
probably used to back in I'm trying to
get these chunks girl we had a little
crusty crust in here just got chopped up
the chunks there a hair in there oh
there's a hair oh that's nasty
oh the hell did I get a hair in there I
didn't even wear a hairnet while mixing
foundations apparently you okay
how much drop the brush and foundation
went everywhere you guys should see the
mess great this is not turning out the
way I wanted it to so with all the
craziness aside shall I begin
I mean the coloring turned out great I
have quite a few different color
foundations and that's because I'm a
chameleon I'm just kidding but my skin
it's a little wider in the winter a
little more tan in the summer so I like
to have my options
I'm just can you guys guess what brush
I'm gonna use to blend this out my
favorite I'm just curious
it feels very full coverage let me just
say that like it feels can you guys see
that girl it feels thick girl oh my god
this baby baby baby let me just tell you
this is covering my dark circles so for
it which means Lauria has a lot of full
coverage foundations on deck the color
looks so nice so now I know if I can't
find my foundation shade I'll just mix
30 foundations together and won't get it
right oh my gosh I can't believe this is
such a cool concept I'm not sure who
came out with this video first there's
always you know speculation on things
like that but if you want who you think
came out with first you know put their
name down there in that comment section
so they can get some love I would love
for you guys to do that it smells good I
swear I think I'm smelling the huda
beauty foundation on them all of them
but also it blended out so pretty
it feels really heavy on my skin and it
is so dewy and shiny that I don't even
know what's happening like the dude just
took over I don't know what foundations
are making it this shiny but holy
guacamole
oh I'm gonna put on just a little bit of
concealer and a little bit of setting
powder because that's how I would
normally wear my foundation and we want
to give this a fair run not just plot
foundation on and leave so let me do
that really quick and then I'll do
check-ins on my camera and we'll finish
off the video that way but this is cool
this is exciting what else can i mix
together oh by the way if you guys
wanted to know what peachy color I had
on my lips it's brunch
I'm more
that's what I was wearing today I always
get questions on my lip color shy mix on
my concealers together too
no that's too much she needs to calm
down this looks kind of cool I mean quit
sticky girl it's sticky love's why six
Laura loves why six take the clean one
and just I'm going to take a white lemon
brush and a little bit of setting powder
and just set yes honey
I'm a sprinkle actually a little bit of
this all over like I normally would and
it's definitely mattifying I think I've
created the world's best full-coverage
foundation just saying I don't know how
it's gonna wear though doing just a very
light light layer of powder to help that
shine okay it looks really pretty right
now so should I add some bronzer let's
just keep going I'm gonna put on some
hoola bronzer with the r14 brush
I mean I'm just gonna pull my lippy and
I'm out of here
and then I'm out of here I'll see you
all no there's not all right guys this
is check-in or one of hat on for about
three hours the forehead area is a
little bit shiny but it looks pretty
good which is shocking
and it's super full coverage so awesome
having deja vu because I were the exact
same lips and eyes and makeup and
everything in shirt yesterday as well I
just thought it looked cute yesterday so
I read it today didn't film yesterday so
now I'm have a deja vu I'm like the same
person two days in a row
okay guys I'm outside so you guys can
see in natural lighting there's gonna be
my last check-in
I am figured to check-ins will be good
I've been wearing it for about six and a
half hours now and this is my final
subnautica s-- on it well it looks
beautiful
honestly the foundation looks amazing it
looks slightly cakey oh no you guys can
see in there it looks a little cakey and
the forehead is shiny shiny shiny can
you see that shine that glow on the
forehead before it looks pretty shiny
like after an hour wearing it the rest
of my face looks okay very very very
full coverage and I think it looks
pretty which I'm so shook about I'm like
which it looks good I mean overall I
think it looks good and I didn't set it
with a setting spray yesterday I did a
full skin today to be a setting spray
like excursion on my snapchat and all
that but yeah Here I am it again
updating makeup but overall I think it
looks good and I can't believe it and
I'm shook and this was really fun to do
