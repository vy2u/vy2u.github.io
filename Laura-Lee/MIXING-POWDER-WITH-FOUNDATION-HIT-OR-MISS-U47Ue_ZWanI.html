channel today's video is going to be me
testing out this velvet eye velvet eyes
er I said that product from Urban Decay
it is mixing a powder into your
foundation to make it nice and matte and
soft and whipped filling now this could
be a gimmick don't forget their shirts
on sale or Los Angeles now calm it might
not be you know it may work really
nicely but I'm gonna try it out and take
off the foundation that have on my skin
I know this isn't a brand new product or
anything but I'm just kidding around to
trying it out she's a little late to the
game but I know you guys still just
because things been tried out before
still want me to try them out coz you
guys like to hear my opinions though I
thought today would be a great time to
test this out and see if it's a flip or
flop or a gimmick yeah that's it that's
what we're gonna do today I hope you
guys are excited and also we're gonna do
a little giveaway because it is December

about the giveaway and without further
ado we're gonna go ahead and sang the

all right so I don't think I have any
announcements other than let's just jump
in and right on into the video
okay guys so this is it it's bye-bye
urban decay I mean you may seen this
around YouTube heck you may not have so
I want I want to test it out I'll
probably film some of this on my table
maybe so I could show me and I've
decided to mix it with a foundation that
I already know how it works and I
already know the finish of the
foundation so I'd really be able to tell
the difference so I'm gonna try it out
with the huda beauty foundation and by
the way I'm using shade cheesecake just
in case you're wondering and that makes
me want a piece of cheese okay let me
read the claims on this so we have the
full jizz on it before we just jump
right in this is $34 so it isn't it's
about the price maybe a little less than
a high-end foundation but more than a
drugstore foundation it's an ultra fine
mixing powder that gives foundation a
velvety feel and a beautiful matte
finish or it can be used alone as a
finishing powder interesting so you can
use it more than one way you instantly
get a velvety foundation texture by
mixing this in says just a dime a mile
it says simply mixing a dime sized
amount into the Naked Skin liquid makeup
oh yes we'll see is a foundational their
foundation huh I'm gonna try it
it's got 4.4 stars which is pretty nice
on safor and it's someone's first
reviews this is the best thing in the
world okay so let me see if I can
actually cuz I might not be able to use
the who don't wanna I don't know but it
says use it with naked skin liquid make
it okay let me see if I have that don't
even know if I have that don't actually
have that foundation so I rigged this
little filming cyst
with my iPhone so we are gonna end up
using it the beauty foundation I want to
see if it works with any liquid
foundation I don't really see why it has
to be okay maybe it does we'll find out
but I'm gonna by the way I'm trying out
this shade I haven't really tried before
so that is like two and a half pumps
which is what I would normally use of
this foundation I'm gonna go ahead and
squirt it now and then it says add a
dime sized amount so here's our Velvet
Iser
so how am I supposed to get a dime sized
amount out of there I saw just like
flicker it let me get a little brush and
try to flick it off so I just have this
little angled liner brush
that's probably it's so fine grain guys
it like just oh it feels so soft okay so
now oh wait so I'm actually just gonna
take it clean synthetic brush and just
sweep it over towards the foundation
take a little science project we're
doing together I love it okay here we go
it like doesn't really mix in it kind of
sets on top of the powder
okay now let's is it funny that the
iPhone X camera is like better than my
Canon wow you can already tell the
texture of the foundation is changing
like it's it's definitely looking a
little bit thicker interesting shoot I
may have gotten a little bit too much
powder so we'll just add a touch more
Foundation I like calmness I can see how
this my waist just another little dot
it's my waist a little bit of your
foundation okay yeah that's looking good
look clumsy Magoo over here I'm doing
this on the top of one of my jewelry box
lids because I couldn't find okay we
need a stop girl okay now we're gonna
put this on her face I couldn't find
them I mix them try for makeup so you
can't wait to try this out let's go back
to the key okay I'm just applying this
foundation to my face with a brush I
will say I think it definitely changed
the texture of the foundation it feels
way more whippet II way more creamy I'm
gonna go ahead and blend it out with the
y6 it feels nice I mean this foundation
shade is too light for me and that is my
own fault for being a goober and try now
a different shade on camera but you can
see the foundation still looks pretty
maybe a little more matte than what it
normally is it feels like just it like
thinking the foundation it just feels
more thick and whipped filling that
makes sense this shade is too light for
long but besides the shade we'll pretend
it's my shade the foundations like dry
on my skin - yeah it definitely
mattified it like it definitely
mattified it compared to what this is
normally like oh yeah and I like the way
it looks it almost looks like it so
lightly has um a little bit more
coverage to it it's definitely more
matte the foundation is normally very
dewy it takes a minute to dry down and
this foundation is pretty much dried on
my skin um so it just like increases the
texture of the foundation it definitely
does what it says it does so far very
interesting products I can see myself
using this in the future for sure
especially with the foundation it's a
little too dewy or maybe needs a little
bit more coverage
I might be crazy with that girl hold on
oh whoa almost fell off my stove okay
now I'm going to apply some concealer
just to see how it plays with other
product I'm just gonna you put on some
of the NARS creamy cream it I'm actually
gonna get a little bit of the velvet
Iser and just set just the inner eye to
see it said you could say your makeup so
I just want to see what's the tape like
I've never felt a powder this
fine-grained I'm Simon look it just
honestly instantly it's like it's matte
it's just a mattifying powder like to
the extreme and I think because it's so
fine grain that it just melts into the
makeup versus your regular setting
powder it's very lightweight when
setting that concealer as well I don't
really die for it setting my concealer
because is so fine grain it kind of
melts into the concentr concealer but
whenever you press a baking powder into
your under-eye it brightens it as well
so I'm not getting that brightened
effect which is totally fine I'm just
saying that I probably will not be using
this to set my makeup but I do love it
in the foundation actually I think my
foundation looks great so I'm just gonna
add a little bit of bronzer I think my
skin looks really nice what do you guys
think sound off in the comments section
you guys know I love to hear your
opinion on it it is $34 and this is like
an add-on to your foundation I think it
worked great by the way with this hooded
Beauty foundation so I don't think it
has to be an urban decay foundation I
think they advertise it like that
because they're McCain made the product
on has to be arabic a foundation i just
think it made the makeup look thicker
nicer more matte a little bit more
coverage maybe don't really recommend it
for setting your concealer maybe it's
spring cleaning around lightly and
setting your foundation I could see it
is using it like that but it definitely
does what the claims
and what it says it's gonna do so I'm
here for it I like it but again it is 34
so you know you guys let me know in the
comment section is this something you
would purchase or do you tone think it's
a gimmick and you're just like anymore
my dolla bills that was definitely fun I
love you guys thank you so much for
being here and watching and by the way I
wanted to say thank you guys for tagging
me in choked-up
tagging me and gimmicky products to test
out I really appreciate it always helps
me to decide you know what I want to
film and you know what's worth it what's
not so I don't know I just want to thank
you guys for doing that I hope you
enjoyed this video I hope it was helpful
also let me just throw in one more thing
you are gonna have to take the time and
like mix up this concoction of
foundation so it's a little more time
consuming and your regular makeup life
doing it this way so just know that into
the account if it's worth you dollar
bill Joe but other than that that's all
