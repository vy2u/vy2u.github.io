video is gonna be on the thickest capias
foundations on the market
I have drugstore and high end
foundations and and I know there is a
lot of donations out there you can have
medium cover sheer coverage or build up
the full coverage but I'm talking about
foundations and you just put them on and
girl it is okay it is just full full
full coverage foundation not really much
in between there also some of my
favorite foundations the world because
I'm a full coverage type of girl I am
trying to get a little more into showing
off my skin appreciating my skin like
letting the world see it I know I guess
I'm full coverage babies out there they
want to know about the good good in full
coverage foundations
so today we're going to be talking about
it and yeah other than that be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
and we'll jump right in okay where do I
begin
first I start with Urban Decay the all
now the all nighter waterproof long wear
liquid foundation is so good
I love this foundation so much it is
very full coverage it's not medium to
full coverage it is full coverage and
the summer time I was using shades 7.0 I
love the bottle I love the little pump
and for whatever reason I get so much
satisfaction and watching that little
piece go up I don't know why that's so
satisfying but it is a tricky thing with
full coverage foundations and you've got
to make sure your shades right because
it's so much cover so you can definitely
tell them the shades off versus a medium
to sheer coverage foundation where you
can kind of squeak by with the wrong
shade if you see like how thick and
whipped that is this product isn't bad
to blend out it's actually pretty easy I
normally like to use my artiste brush
this one is filthy filthy filthy but I
normally like to use an artiste brush or
kabuki brush to blend out a full
coverage foundation I like to use the
baked kabuki which is great for breaking
the under-eye but I like to use this to
blend out foundation as well it is the S
89 by Sigma or if you're a morphe girl
I've been loving BG 36 brush to blend
out a full coverage foundation stop this
is very long wearing
and it looks great on camera it's like I
said those not going to be skin peering
through but Ages in photography pictures
and on camera this is a good full
coverage foundation another great full
coverage foundation that has seen so
much love it looks a little crusty down
in there but actually on youth number
seven and number five is number seven in
this summer and this one's seen a lot of
love Ivy's number five around the winter
nut month this is a Milani conceal and
perfect so it's a 201 foundation use
this be able to use the epic and sealer
and a foundation and I completely agree
with being able to do that because this
is stick enough to cover up your dark
circles as well I prefer to use a
concealer with it just because you guys
know you're a girl like the hollow her
face I mean it almost looks oddly enough
it looks some come on guy come on oddly
enough it looks kind of similar to the
Urban Decay foundation it's just like
that whip extremely thick full coverage
foundation I love wearing this one all
day it will last you all day is very
long wearing I find that this one
doesn't get too greasy on my skin I know
there were a lot of reviews on it
oxidizing I didn't have that problem
with this foundation it worked out for
me
okay so much it's such one of my
favorite drugstore foundations to exists
is this is this foundation right here
another one of my all-time favorite
foundations that ever existed is the
hourglass vanish foundation and people
who are props are a little weird about
six pound Asians I definitely recommend
giving this a try it's just so buttery
this is the one I'm wearing right now
and if you can see it's just average and
another thing I really like about this
one is that it doesn't really seek down
into my smell and who I adore how well
this colors on my skin that is so good
and it just melts like butter into your
skin my absolute favorite way applying
this is with a our teeth brush
I feel like beauty blenders are great
for medium sheer cover foundations but I
feel like they just I feel like they
take away from full coverage a little
bit when dabbing it you don't get like
that really good full coverage effect
with a Beauty Blender love Beauty
Blender is just not muscle
foundations with money you might not see
me use them too much but this is one the
best I'm in shade beige and I use a lot
of this I remember I was doing it
instagrams it's a room with it and I put
it all over my face I got always dude
we're like oh cool Warhawks burger let
me tell you the truth about something do
your makeup hell you like to do it you
can never stop learning how to do makeup
but it's me putting not much foundation
on my skin makes me happy and like the
way the outcome is and imma keep doing
it on to the next is a newbie it not all
honesty I haven't won this not many
times I've only won it twice in my whole
entire life up this is the brand-new
infallible toe cover foundation I like
the way the tube squeezes out like a
little turkey like a little worm that
comes out is just so sick and it's
supposed to have like a whip lightweight
fill I don't know that's a good word for
it
I did get a wee bit greasy when wearing
it so I definitely recommend setting it
anyways as you can see it just reminds
me so much of the urban decay just like
that really fixed still this one's a
little more whip lightweight than the
urban decay but again you got to get
your shade exactly right with it I'm
even see a natural beige that's normally
my shade with L'Oreal but it looks
really good on my skin I'm not mad about
that I definitely want to try it out
more before I give like more firm bangs
on it if you set it with a powder it
definitely is long wearing and that's
about all that I'll say about it it says
it has a natural finish it's not that
natural to me it's one like foundation
II which I love I'm all about it like I
don't really have skin peering through
for that really nice soft natural finish
it on fire but I might keep trying it
out and get back to you guys on it I
just wanted to mention it because truth
be said it is so coverage well I have
another one this one is my cover of X
and it's funny how I use the foundation
by the way this one's got a cf-30 in it
this is their total cover cream
foundation and this is so incredibly
full coverage
it's almost social covers that I won't
use it for my whole entire face what I
will actually do with this product here
is whenever I use a sheer to medium
coverage foundation and I just feel like
they're spot
the need a touch more coverage I'll
growl like a small little kabuki and
I'll tap it in it and then I'll go to
those areas and then I'll just add the
full coverage with this little compact
but it's so good for that it's very long
wearing definitely need to be set with
the powder because it can get a little
bit crazy but I love it
I've carried it in my purse I've used it
for a long time a little bit goes a
really long way and is it set with a
nice translucent powder it does
photograph well just make sure your
chances of powder is not I wanted that
to be like a good does not flash back
moving on and this is a foundation I
have back up hold with this is my Marc
Jacobs for Marvel foundation this is a
very odd product because you get a good
shake first of all but very full
coverage and you use the smallest amount
of it to get the most coverage which is
just Wow
the problem I had with it it seeped into
every little crevice and I face so
hardcore and made me look cry-cry it
would even get like in my forehead
wrinkles all around my nose everything
which is creasing up so terribly with
this foundation by the way you just kind
of like one two three and blend down a
little bit go solo such a long way
very lightweight how I use this
foundation is if I have a medium
coverage to sheer coverage foundation
that I'm loving I will add in like one
dot of this stuff and it will build up
that covers like crazy like I like to
customize my other foundations using the
Marc Jacobs remarkable I bought this
product myself it was fifty bucks I
believe and I'm just I'm going to go to
waste you know so that's the way I use
it some people have also claimed to have
troubles with it seeping into those
creases it's almost like it put this
really thin mask over your face is so
full coverage so yeah it's a little
tricky to play with but I like it mixed
with other foundations and it's full
coverage okay and last but certainly not
least I wanted to mention a BB type
cream that's very full coverage which is
nearly impossible to find because most
of times BB creams it's just a beauty
balm it's a moisturizer with a dot of
tint meaning they how much coverage at
all but this is the Velvet Matte skin
tint from NARS and this is
my favorite product to wear from going
out on the beach like basically if it's
a moment where I don't want to wear a
lot of makeup but I want a lot of
coverage at always use this I'm in shade
medium one and it has that lightweight
whipped texture it has a lot of
sunscreen in it to protect your skin but
it does a world of coverage look at that
honey and it smells so strong like
sunscreen but I love you love the smell
of it because it reminds me of the beach
and it makes me happy it can get a
little bit greasy but honestly whenever
I'm you know doing the work on the beach
or if I'm going to be I don't really
mind is my foundation or my face product
gets a little greasy because I like the
natural shine to the skin this is
supposed to be all matte it just has
like so much sunscreen in it I think it
gets a little crazy after wearing for a
long time but it is so beautiful on the
skin it gives me like that little bit of
coverage from the other eyes or just
makes me look a little put together
whenever I wear this so it's pretty full
coverage I love it and I recommend it to
you guys okay guys so maybe we can keep
this going like the most full coverage
concealers full coverage facial powders
