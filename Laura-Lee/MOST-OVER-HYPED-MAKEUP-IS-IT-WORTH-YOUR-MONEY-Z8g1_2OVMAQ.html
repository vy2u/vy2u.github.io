today's video is going to be me testing
out overhyped makeup meaning you've seen
it all over the internet and we need to
find out if it is worth yeah my neck so
I have like new to Phase two new k kwx
mario the new brett MINIX morphe a lot
of these are collapse II always I picked
this stuff that is just like so talked
about right now and you're just like
girl is it worth my Donatella bill yeah
anyways I'm gonna try to get this video
up today it's Saturday I'm filming
they're drilling stuff upstairs right
now hanging stuff on the wall so I'm
like please you gotta be quiet
I forgot my Dr Pepper so I guess we need
to just jump right in and get started
but without further ado I'm gonna sing
my subscribe song and then we'll do the
thing be sure and subscribe now let's go
ahead and jump right into today's video
No where shall we begin I think we'll
begin with this tatcha the silk canvas
this is their filler finishing
protective primer so it's supposed to
protect your skin from the environment
but it's also supposed to be poor
feeling oh my god I hope you guys all
hear the drilling it's gonna be so
annoying boss it smells like the touch
of skin care which I love the smell of
and I'm not gonna lie I'm used it before
let me just tell you I have too much on
my hand let me just also tell you I love
it so much I mean it is supposed to
protect your skin against the
environment and just Realty like I don't
know if it does I don't know okay maybe
it does I live in smog City LA so
hopefully it does but as far as the way
it makes your foundation look on top of
it makes your skin look really beautiful
I love that part of it it also comes in
this cool little unique packaging next
up we have the cover effect power play
now I've seen this on every youtuber
instagramers snapchat and IG story this
foundation and I seen it everywhere but
I truly haven't heard a lot about it per
se don't really know like if it's good
or not and it comes a little I think
cover effects makes really good like
base products for your face so we're
gonna squeegee out some I don't even
know who it's kind of thick which I like
got some of my y6 brush this is
overhyped but you know what it's worth
the hype I think here we go just start
stippling that out I picked a good shade
I pick G+ 50 had a lot of shades in this
so come out you little shirt
she likes to think she's this tan but
she ain't
I like the foundation so far it is more
of a medium coverage not really a full
coverage foundation but it does blend
out really nicely on the skin and it
feels just good so you know I'm here for
it so far I think it's a pretty good
foundation I don't really think is that
pool coverage but it has a lot of
pigment and color to it so so far not so
bad and okay let me put on my brows I
think we should go ahead and do our eye
shut up with his girl I know you're
waiting for me to dive in and tell you
the T on this here's the palette this is
what it looks like you get ten shades
it's 48 five bucks
you get some pretty gold and bronzy
colors as well as a blue and a purple
and then a good matte transition shade a
red matte as well as a dark brown matte
and then some great brow bone colors it
is great packaging appreciate I'm going
to go in is this cream color right here
and I always like to go in with these
shades just just soften up the crease
area and I used it in five seven three
brush to do that with the next I'm gonna
move on to my typical Y 13 wander then
our 39 brush and I'm gonna go in with
the transition shade which is this
caramel brown shade so far they're
blending really nicely the matte seem to
be very soft and pressed well into the
pallet and they do have a lot of pigment
what I like to do here is just take a
little on at my blending brush and I
like to just sweep back and forth back
and forth I can winch or wiper motions
and I'll take this color and I'll just
put it all the way from inner to outer
corner because I'm just gonna use it as
my transition today girl you know I
can't help myself have to tap into this
red shade and tap off the excess I'm
just gonna use my same brush right here
and I'm also just gonna pop this into
the crease I feel like these colors are
blending out so nicely as you can see on
my eye they're not too dry so I think
this palette is really nice I mean i
swatched a couple of the blue and
shimmers and purples for you guys on IG
story and they felt really nice and
creamy very pigmented the palette is 45
bucks for ten shades these colors have
been seen before but I just truly feel
like if Mario and Kim came out with like
some foil duochrome
crazy colors I don't really think that
it would make much sense for that to be
their collab palette since you never see
Kim wear those colors I think it makes
sense to create a palette of colors that
Kim's wears whereas that just happens to
be a lot of neutrals but you do get two
pops of color here sometimes I just see
people get so upset and I'm like but
guys it's like their collab palette you
know it's of course it's gonna beat the
neutral colors that he uses on ER I mean
that way it makes sense but you know
guys just really think about it I mean
you know for yourself do you are you a
fan of them if so then get it as a
collector's item do you already have all
these colors wait til her next palette
drops
I think makeups supposed to be fun and
sometimes it seems to be getting a
little overwhelming and people get upset
but I just want to keep the fun and
makeup and remember it's all for fun and
if you like it or if you're a fan then
get it and if you don't then you know
just keep moving past it their stuff
watching all the time I'm sure she'll
launch more palettes that you may fall
in love with it may have more fun color
feel like I have to tap into this blue
color cuz it's just like the highlight
of the palette as you can see on my
brush it's just like picks up so much
color that it's just a little light
brush swatch of the color
alright there is a finger swatch oh
really pretty so I'm just gonna put this
blue have you guys been looking at the
little booger right here the whole
entire video I am so sorry that's
disturbing and distracting and gross I
just feel like I should put this blue
everywhere because it's so pretty this
happened to a little bit of the blue on
a blender brush just to soften up the
edges
alright the top of our eyes are done I'm
gonna go ahead and do my concealer and I
figure why not use the k'kaw over height
concealer and I'm gonna go ahead and
apply this so if you guys haven't seen
it I did a full review video on it so
check it out if you guys want to see
more on her whole collection I do feel
like the makeup line is dropping a lot
of makeup really quickly which is
interesting
I do get when people get overwhelms
whenever like so much product launches
like I totally get it it's just like
whoa that's a lot so I do like the
palette and I did like these concealers
however like I totally understand like
these for the price like you only get a
tiny bit of product so it's kind of like
not a lot of powder because my powder I
don't know I just use like a lot of
baking powder in the little jar so tiny
so I just feel like you have to be
careful with that so this is the powder
I liked it a lot I use the shade number
two but again I like this jar is so
small it is 18 bucks was just a lot
cheaper than my Laura Mercier so I give
her that but as I was saying it's just
like not a lot of product so I'm like
I'm just no I'm gonna burn through this
and like be done with it in no time I
bake just a little bit you know I didn't
want to go overboard I just baked my
whole to her face I love baking so much
but I have found it like after I bake
really setting my face with like mac
fix+ or something it helps them melt the
bacons in my face is until so dry or
looks so like like the Sahara Desert
next up to
came out with the natural collection and
can I just say the packaging is so
pretty like it is beautiful and I've
seen lots of reviews of this and it
hyped up already so I really want to try
it out and see the quality of the makeup
this makeup definitely reminds me of of
the old school to face that just had
such a good quality and was so beautiful
oh I love this two things no I'm really
excited I'm gonna take an hour 14 brush
which is one of my favorite bronzer
brushes and I'm using the chocolate
soleil matte bronzer so it's very
pigmented I feel like I do this a lot or
have a heavy hand with bronzer and I
always immediately regret it I truly
feel like this bronzer has like so much
pigment and it almost more pigment than
the original Soleil bronzer so just be
careful with that other than that I
really think it's beautiful so I'm going
to go into this natural faith palette
and I'm gonna use this in Maine blush
today I'm gonna take it for blush oh my
gosh so much came off okay we better mix
shades cuz I need trying to get crazy up
in here
yeah the blush is beautiful it's like a
nice little wash of color also here are
some swatches of the highlight shade of
this natural face palette
they're like both iridescent once pink
and once more of a white gold but
they're both really pretty then for a
highlighter we have the beautiful babe
in paradise palette from morphe eggs
Brett Minh I think I'm gonna put it on
the gold shade I'm such a sucker for
really beautiful gold highlight oh that
gold trim might be a little deep
actually okay I'm actually gonna go in
with this middle shade
though she loves the highlights and I'm
gonna go ahead and spritz all of my face
and then for the first time ever I'm
gonna try out the Smashbox super fan
fanned out mascara here's a little wand
it's like the plastic you want Wow I
hate myself today so I like the mascara
I feel like my lashes as you guys know
what they just grow downward there's
nothing I can do about that
so I don't think it really lifted them
like too crazy but I do feel like you're
really like fandom out which is what it
says it doesn't like they really spread
out
dried pretty fast you don't have to
worry about it getting clumpy so I did
like that about the mascara it's time
for a lash you guys knew it was coming
for the lower lash line I'm gonna go
back in with that middle brown shade and
then they take our lovely blue shade and
just start whoops okay my lower lash
mascara I swear to you this like the
most hyped up thing ever it's the
extended play gigablack lash mascara
from Mac so I'm gonna try it out my
lower lash line I just ordered this the
other day I think you did really well on
my lower lashes and I feel like it like
snatch them up yeah I like it
take it imports you win brush in this
color right here the lightest shimmery
color put it right there in that inner
corner I'm also gonna pop some on my
brow bone as well her collection has two
lip glosses one is juicy one is super
nude you see is the pink and super nude
is the super new coat II Mario Kim also
has a classic a nude lipstick so I'm
gonna go ahead and put that on I think
this is just like a really pretty nude
color I definitely feel like I've seen
this nude color on Kim a time or two so
it's really pretty on and yeah I think
the final like is it do I have my brows
on this time do you guys remember that
time I needed a tutorial and forgot to
put brows on because I'm crazy guys what
do you think of the look I think it
looks very pretty though blue everything
worked out really well do you kind of
think they changed the formula this but
I still liked it um the foundation it's
really pretty and it kind of dried down
why did um set it but I did dry down
pretty matte it's not that pool coverage
so if I'm wanting to be like a lighter
glam I would probably go for that it's
like a good medium coverage foundation I
did like the mascara so now I put it out
there for you guys to decide for
yourselves if you like it it's worth
your dollar dollar bills I hope you guys
