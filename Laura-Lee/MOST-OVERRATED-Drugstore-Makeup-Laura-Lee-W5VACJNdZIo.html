can't talk about anything until we talk
about the fact we finally hit a million
subscribers Wow I know it's so cheesy to
be like this is so surreal but guy come
on I cannot believe we're here no -
thank you for all of you who have taken
the time to subscribe to my channel who
leave me those sweet comments constantly
who view my videos I truly appreciate
you taking the time to be a part of my
YouTube family that means so much to me
I worked so hard on my channel and
because of you all that hard work pays
off and I never I mean I just when I
started this channel I always knew that
one day I would I would have a million
subscribers I knew I would work so so so
hard and I would get there and I knew it
would take me 10 to 20 years to do it
but it happened in three years and
that's the part that's so surreal to me
and it's because of how much love and
support that you guys show me you
sitting wherever you're sitting looking
at your phone tablet computer it's
because of you my dreams are coming true
and words cannot possibly thank you
enough for that really quickly I just
wanna let you guys know I started with
this channel at a time in my life where
I was very very alone I was lost I
didn't know what I wanted to do with my
life I didn't have friends around me
hated my job and YouTube was there to
save me and I created videos because
makeup was my passion and creating
content and you know having a connection
with the people was my dream just know
if you ever feel alone or lost or
confused I just want you to be able to
come to my channel and just have a
mental break from the stressful day in
and day out of life and maybe even get a
laugh out of my videos because I am an
idiot and I love that about me I was my
whole intent and creating my channel and
I really feel like I did create a place
for people to come and just take a seven
to ten minute break of life and enjoy a
video so thank you again anyways we're
gonna jump right in this video I'm gonna
talk to you guys about products that did
not work out me from the drugstore now I
just did a video about products that
didn't work out
for me that are high and if you want to
check that out I'll leave it link down
below and I got amazing feedback from
you guys on that video so I thought I
would continue it and we would talk
about products that don't cost so much
but they still weren't worth my money
and keep in mind I don't hate these
brands the products just doesn't work
out for me and we are all different and
that's what's so great about the world
is that we're all different so just
because it didn't work out for me
doesn't mean it's not going to work out
for you but I want to explain my part
also be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave and we're gonna jump
right and we're gonna guess I'm too much
first product that I really don't like
and this product I had to convince
myself that I didn't like because I
tried it out for so long and I even
mentioned it and use it in videos this
is the Maybelline the nudes palette and
this palette was raved about all over
YouTube and sometimes YouTube like makes
you think you love things and then
you're like I don't love this okay
actually the color arrangement is quite
nice I would like a few more warm tones
but that's just me it's just chalky
altogether and like the colors just
flinging everywhere and it's not what I
look for in an eyeshadow palette and I
realize unless I was doing like a
specific drugstore look and I had to use
this that I wasn't using at all camera
and then I really thought about the PAL
and I was like it's because I don't like
the palette and I need to set the record
straight so we've seen this palette
around on my channel as well as
everybody else's channel but my honest
opinion on it just bottom of my heart
honesty I don't like the palette I don't
think the quality of that eyeshadow so
nice did you make some good eyeshadow
sir but in these palettes I do not like
their eyeshadows I got the little rocker
one it was worse than this one they're
disappointed so I don't recommend these
like it says chalky dusty not enough
pigmentation especially the matte shades
they're just pitiful um so this isn't
big no for me Oh recently I purchased um
the troublin I purchased actually all
three of cover girls new facial primers
and I tried out all three of them and I
liked the one for combination skin a lot
that's my favorite I do like the one for
dry skin the one for oily skin it did
nothing for me I have like this old Pitt
oh my I know I say the word all wrong I
know I have an old pit on my forehead
produces a stupid amount of grease on my
face and then the rest of my face is dry
so we don't even know what's going on in
my face it's just getting crazy but this
stuff it did nothing for me
I'm so holy skin and you want to save
your I don't think this is going to be
it okay what's up next let's talk this
positions formula bronzer this is the
Argan wear bronzer a nice bronzer very
pigmented comes up on the skin
beautifully in blends beautifully
Physicians Formula makes the best
drugstore bronzer you're like why the
hell are you mentioning but there is a
problem with this bronzer and the
problem is the smell guys they I smell
it right now I do they incorporate it
Argan all in their products which is
nice because it hydrates the skin makes
it very soft the smell will knock you
ten feet back like if I open this oh
this smells like an old man's Cologne
there's nothing wrong with old men's
cologne if you like it but if you put it
on your face and have to inhale it all
day eventually will me I eventually
won't get a headache and a bad one so I
couldn't wear it because of the smell
but I think that actual product is nice
I just and you can tell where I've tried
to wear it and my me opening this right
now I don't know if I have special smell
receptors don't even know if that's a
thing um God dog mm-hmm next up from Wet
n Wild actually hate saying anything
wrong about a product from wet long
because it's a price point on them um
it's such a great price always with wet
wild products and I have been so
impressed with products from them
because of their price range and the
quality that you get it pains me to say
anything negative with this video I mean
I want to share honesty with you why is
my camera up so high I feel like I
should lower it I just want to be
extremely honest with you guys and so
these geometric highlighters no a little
bit chalky and they don't put off enough
pigment for me as you can see that's a
thick finger swatch and it's almost like
nothing comes off so it's I don't even
know what they were doing making these
because they came out with the one I
mean like what is that where is the
highlight but needless to say anyway
there's three of them that I got
and then all of them have very poor
pigmentation we're a little bit chalky
and just worn terrible they weren't
worth putting on my face to me so these
were no next up is another product that
it was one of those moments where I was
just like I don't like this product I
try to like it so much but I don't know
I get it and it's the Ready Set gorgeous
by covergirl foundation and there's
nothing in particularly nothing
particularly about this foundation and I
ruin my life
but it just didn't work for me in a
sense that it did nothing for my skin it
didn't make my skin look better the
coverage wasn't that great it was a
little bit greasy on me I mean like
there was nothing great about it and
there are so many foundation to in the
drugstore that are so great and do so
many great things for my skin I quit
fooling with this one so this I just
don't recommend to you guys just like a
foundation next up is a concealer from
the drugstore and this is by hard candy
it's called glamoflage I actually think
this concealer got pretty popular at one
point and now I think this concealer
does a fabulous job of covering the dark
circles but the problem I had with it
was it was a little bit too cakey for me
and made me look like I had a little bit
of cake face which is what I normally
look like because girl love my makeup
when I blend this out it was like
literally that sound of things
okay now literally and then when I said
it with a powder it was just heavy and
greasy it was too much for me so I'm the
package it claims to be a heavy duty
concealer so it kind of like Hello I
said I was heavy um so I know I kind of
ignored that warning sign but I
definitely don't like the concealer on
my skin or anywhere else next product
that didn't work for me is a super BB by
Physicians Formula I believe this is a
newer product and it was a little bit
too gimmicky for me I am like all about
the cream contour and highlight living
for it this was a little bit too much
for me because I'm not going to draw
stripe across my face and blend it out
it's just too gimmicky it doesn't work
out great I kind of made a mess of it a
little bit and let me be honest the
formula the product is not bad however I
don't like the concealer that much or
the high
under that much because it's got like
sparkle in it but then it's so light
that it looks like you just put a stripe
of concealer on your cheekbone versus a
cream highlight so it's not a good
highlighting shade and then these are
nice contour shades it's just too
gimmicky um so overall I would I
definitely wouldn't waste my money on
this one another one I don't know I
think YouTube brain washes me and makes
me think I like things that I don't like
and I'm taking a stand and I'm like I
don't like these products and it's okay
but these are the l'oreal true looming
these are the liquid loominator z' i
like the powder ones better I'm not
obsessed with the powder ones but I like
them better than the liquid ones
highlight game at the drugstore she's
hurtin like we need pigmentation so they
blend out a little too creamy because I
like anytime I put in liquid on my face
to it to blend out into like a very soft
powder if something stays very damp or
too creamy no no and that's what this
did you can see on camera it does look
kind of nice but this is the lightest
one the gross gold it like I had a patch
of too much of a red on my cheekbone
instead of like a actual highlight and
the bronzer just like a put bronzer in
the wrong spot with a little bit of
sparkle it just did not work out from me
and I found myself absolutely never
reaching for them and that's when I
realized I don't like this product that
is it for this video I mentioned quite a
few products um let me know in the
comments if there was a drugstore
product you were excited about but it
didn't work out for you we need to know
don't withhold information from us okay
