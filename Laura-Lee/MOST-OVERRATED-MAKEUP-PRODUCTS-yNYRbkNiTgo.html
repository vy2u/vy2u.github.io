today narcissus hey guys welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be at
products that just downright don't work
I mean well it didn't work for me
I don't like home honesty is always the
best policy and on YouTube and we took
so much about products that we love we
love you love I love it love because we
don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings so we
don't want to make anyone feel like we
hate their brand I feel like it helps
out my viewers to talk about products
that didn't work out for me doesn't mean
I hate the brands No doesn't mean I
absolutely despise everything they
create no it just means like the product
did it work and I'm not gonna recommend
it and I'm gonna talk about why if I
talk about a product that you love and
it didn't work out for me honey Chad
don't take no offense oh just let it
roll off the shoulder you know I'm
saying also be sure to subscribe to my
channel before you live subscribe
because I'm kidding I'm not that cool
but you should subscribe anyways because
post a lot of videos and I love for you
to check them out so we're gonna jump
right in and get started I have a lot of
foundations I have a lot of highlights
just like a lot of products that are
popular or see people talk about review
all the time and I just want to give my
little spiel on you know I'm trying out
first product we're going to talk about
is by Marc Jacobs so funny people love
this foundation and I know why they love
it because it is the most incredible
full coverage foundation and you only
have to use like one little dot Abid I
reviewed this a long time ago and the
more that I wore it I was like walking
through I think like Target or Walmart
and my husband was like oh my god
whatever foundation you're wearing you
never need to wear again and if a
husband says that there's a problem with
makeup because guys don't always notice
the little problems we see a makeup but
if my husband noticed my smile lines oh
there's like every time my face made a
wrinkle you know what I'm saying the
foundation just like the wrinkle was
like so hardcore in the foundation and
made me look older made me look at
wrinkles out a lot of business going on
it didn't get greasy on me it covered my
complexion well it looked great it wore
well but that was the issue with it
the wrinkles I didn't terrified to go
back to this foundation because it was
just your little to me I might try and
have again but it's just like I'm not
gonna wear it to an event how's that
happen you know the next foundation I
might talk about that was a big no-no
for me was a new one this one's my
makeup forever and it's a water blend
foundation now I give kudos to make up
forevers for coming out with a unique
product this foundation is 80 percent
water so it kind of doesn't hide what it
is it tells you like on the packaging
what this foundation is called water
blend for God's sakes I put it on my
skin and worn it two or three times I'm
in shade why 405 and it's like nothing
happened
look it's zero coverage it feels like I
literally just put water on my skin and
I feel like it's just too expensive for
water so I don't recommend it if you
want it there there are other
foundations out there that are actually
sheer covers this is closer to like
nothing coverage I could see this
possibly working out better for the body
makeup through this for face and body
but I just wouldn't spend that much on
body makeup especially if it's gonna be
this year if I make it's gonna be this
year I just opted for a no makeup makeup
kind of day rather than even foolin with
it and spending the money on a nose I'm
next product to talk about is the
Maybelline precise curvy this is a brand
new eyeliner they just came out with and
I was very excited about it but oh the
one on it or the little tip on it it's a
little bit gimmicky for me umm it's
awkward it's just awkward it's like me
in high school really that's not even
the thing that I don't like most about
the thing I don't like most about it is
the fact that it's not black enough and
I typically always wear a shimmery
eyeshadow of a shochet shimmery ostrich
oh I typically always where'd shimmery
eyeshadow and the shimmer comes through
the eyeliner so it looks like you have
eyeshadow all over your eye liner is a
hot mess it happens every time I tried
it out this is a big note for me I
definitely do not recommend her to you
the next product I don't recommend this
is the skin clearing complexion
Perfector by Neutrogena this is a newer
product for them
and I found that this is like for acne
it's like if you're having problems with
acne it's supposed to be good for
breakouts and then I found it to be like
an extremely greasy product so I'm just
like what the hell just happened
normally products are for acne I mean it
has salicylic acid in it so I get what
they were going with that
but like it's greasy and it is sheer
coverage it just feels like one of those
heavy BB creams um which is bad for acne
so I don't recommend this to you guys I
don't like it personally next product I
want to talk about I did a full review
on these so you probably know it didn't
work out for me if you watch that video
why haven't you watched it is by
lipstick queen so I tested out all their
magic color-changing makeup and these
did not work out for me because they
don't fully change color I feel like
it's a wee bit misleading
um the lipstick and blush do change
color but the lip glosses don't because
they have blue and green glitter within
them and the glitter doesn't change
colors it actually stays green and blue
and it makes your lips just look like
you been eating dirt ello up come on now
these were a big for me like I'll never
wear these the next product is bicolor
pop so a lot of people have been raving
about their sculpting Stix and let me
clarify they have the highlighter shades
and then the contouring shades the
contour shades work out well for me
I use a lot of product because I find
that they blend out so easy to most look
like you don't have any on but if you
use enough product it looks amazing and
it blends out flawlessly so I found the
same issue with these no man whenever
you highlight your face you kind of you
know use it kind of like your concealer
well these are just too sheer they don't
do enough coverage so they I find that
they don't actually like highlight your
face however if you're looking for a new
contouring stick I do like the color pop
ones I think they're awesome blossom I
just would stray away from the
highlighter ones because if you can see
like I mean it blends out nicely but
watch it blends out to almost nothing
ever you highlight you more Sony like
that coverage like with a concealer like
you need to cover a little these were
now next up is a product from
now everybody loves him a little bit
lush luscious I find to be in my
personal opinion a little bit of a
pricier for what it is but it is organic
and handmade so I understand the price
point on it but the bare angels on bare
skin this is like a body and face
cleanser and you're supposed to take it
it smells nice it smells kind of minting
like it smells like organic like you
ever have a friends it's like all
organic natural it smells like what
their house would smell like nothing
wrong with that kudos them I wish I was
all natural and organic I'm just too
lazy to be that way you're supposed to
take an air hand mix it with water rub
it on your bed and you get off sensual
you don't have to get sensual use it as
a body cleanser and a face cleanser but
it has like these little seats in it
they got all over my shower and bathtub
and used it twice in both times I have
toes like covered it on I had to take it
and clean out my whole bathtub Oh time
so that's already like oh hell no I'm
not asking with this I felt dirty when I
used it I felt like there was like
grease on me like I massage grease into
my skin I felt so gross after I use is
it was a hot-ass mess going on in my
bathtub this did not work out for me
whatsoever I daren't sure won't try it
again I might actually go ahead and toss
this because I'm not gonna give it I'll
give it to an enemy but no I'm just
kidding I don't really have enemies so
the next product I'm going to talk about
is my pixie skin treats my pixie beauty
and I love pixie beauty and I have run
into a product that I don't care for for
them care for fur do you like how I said
that care for or care for them hmm
I make up words this is their nourishing
lip polish and I'm all about a lip
polish it's supposed to smooth out your
lips but yet be an exfoliator so it has
this gritty texture in it just to leave
it on your lips that's what the
instructions say I'm not making it up
ever I left it on my lips it literally
just felt like I put on a lip balm with
sand in it and I was just wearing it
around I just don't understand how
that's supposed to be a good invention
it may work for some people for me it
was just super uncomfortable I feel like
there was ish all up in my lip gloss
that's how I was feeling wearing the
this so because of that that was up for
me I feel like it's a very professional
way of explaining that it didn't work
out
the next product that didn't work out
for me is by Laura Geller this is their
filter finish setting powder it's the
shade universal so it looks like this it
looks like a child's artwork um
not why I don't like it I actually think
it looks kind of cool but you're
supposed to just like mix it all
together it looks like this and then you
can set your makeup with it but like you
say that it was like a highlighter this
is meant to be a setting powder that
looks like a highlighter now if we were
working with that this doesn't know it's
too shiny to set your makeup with I
don't understand it completely it's a
little bit I guess you could say
gimmicky for me is how is this a setting
powder I don't recommend this I don't
sure don't recommend it as a setting
powder I might recommend it as a
highlight like a bazaar highlight
because look how she Marie it is as
unreal um but as a setting powder oh
hell no another note for me was by the
essay edit I tried this out in one of my
like testing out first impressions
makeup tutorials and I tried this out
and this mascara is double din so it's a
really cool theory but overall I ended
up not liking it at all this size it's
supposed to add volume I found that the
bristles if you can see them they're
like spread apart so they don't actually
grasp the lashes so it they just slide
right through my little oh my little ol
booty lashes I just spit everywhere al
but they just slid right through my
lashes and it didn't add any volume so I
went to the next side which this one is
for lift which I could use a little lift
I will say I did like this side a little
bit better but there's like no one it's
almost like it's just on a stick and so
it was hard to grab my lashes the way I
just overall I didn't care for the
mascara don't recommend okay lastly I
have to go back not really go back on my
word but like in my drugstore favorites
I mentioned these masters trip sticks as
a favorite and they are still a favorite
I just want to clarify how to use
because one day I used him a little bit
too much and it turned out to be a total
nightmare my face and all I could think
of it's like I told people I love home
and now I would like poo so let me just
say this when you use them do not apply
them directly to your skin get some on
your finger and tap tap tap and that's
it
don't go in heavy with this product
because at the end of the day my
foundation and powder like separate it
from the product and even though I
blended it out with my finger whenever I
applied it to my face like I just had a
stripe on my face and like my foundation
powder had separated for it I look crazy
so just to clarify on using these like
they work if you use them the right way
if you don't use them the right way so
that is it for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed my little poopoo products
that didn't work out for me
