today's video is going to be talking
about underrated products that I don't
see are getting enough love they're
actually fabulous makeup products and
have a little bit of skincare in here to
the needs more love there are so many
parts coming out nowadays and and just
so much around is happening and that I
feel like something's get skipped over
so I just want to show in this video
sharing a little extra love on those
products hope you guys are excited I've
done this video in the past you guys
really enjoyed it that's why I'm doing
it again hopefully I'm not repeating it
he has the same hormones and be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
and we're going to go ahead and jump
right in and get started
hey the skincare is something that I
don't talk about enough on my channel I
steal so we're going to start off with
skincare a two actually three products
and skincare that I don't really see a
lot of people talking about that I love
the first one is a newer item
this is the Korres Greek yogurt smoothie
this is a moisturizer priming base
basically it's great to put on before
you do your makeup I am a dry skin girl
out there so this is great for my skin
if you have dry skin and a lot of dry
patches this is going to be perfect to
put on your skin right before you do
your makeup and going to clear up any of
that dryness also it has a very gel like
feel to it so it's not going to clog
your pores it's more of a water basin
and old base so it's not too much
moisturizing realflow breezy even if you
have only sea and I think this product
will be great for you just because it's
so lightweight however it does kind of
smell like old leather shoes
so I'm not digging that about it the
actual product itself is fire pls just
plant so the next part I want to talk to
you guys about is by the drunk elephant
and this brand is too talked about
enough all their products that I've
tried out I've fallen in love with and I
really like this night serum this is to
refine your skin and help with texture
so this is also a gel product very
lightweight not going to clog your pores
and it lifts away dead skin cells so you
have like a bright new luminous skin is
a great product I've been using it for
about a week and a half and I've really
been enjoying it and I really feel like
my skin is quite luminous and then my
third skin care products that I want to
mention to you guys is by you way I feel
like I may have mentioned this Punk in
my last underrated by like really but
this is our anti-aging moisturizing
progress skin that's hyaluronic acid
which is great for anti-aging and not
only that it's a little bit moisturizing
but not too thick on the skin so it is
perfect I normally pack this little guy
to travel because I don't like to plant
pack hard tubes whenever I travel that
way nothing gets broken is fabulous I
love it and it's definitely worth buying
so those are my skin care products that
isolate don't get enough love let's move
on in to makeup the first product is
this rinky-dink little container here
this is the new cover FX this is a
perfect setting powder and I mean I've
heard it mentioned now and then but
still I feel like the Laura Mercier
powder is taking over the market and I
feel like this is so good it's not
better because it doesn't have talked in
it it doesn't flash back on camera and
it set your makeup just as good as a la
Mercier translucent powder plus it has a
soft top where you won't get a big mess
you can close it and that way when you
open it you don't have an explosion of
powder everywhere
so I have been using this non-stop since
I got my hands on it
whoo so good next to mascara by MAC
Cosmetics this is the intern in hmm in
step insta curl Wow why this is insta
curl on any any of stop filming and go
to bed or something okay it's a girl you
don't ever see it talked about and it's
really great if you like your lashes
separated if you like this spidery stick
lashes you probably won't like this one
but it's good for separated lashes it
coats them really well and the coolest
thing about it is the wand so the one
looks like a little shark fin like Janet
pennant minute and then you turn it all
the way around
well not all the way around but pretty
close and it like curls the one that way
you can really get up in there and you
can curl your lashes or you can have it
straight whatever you prefer you get the
best of both worlds so this one I know a
lot of people take their one and bend it
themself but I just think this is the
most unique thing and the products
actually really good and it doesn't get
talked about a lot I haven't ever seen
this product marked hair given this to
me when I was with Bill in Canada and I
was like woah shook so yeah now you know
next time I talk about a lipgloss this
has been one of my favorite lip glosses
since um I could afford it this is the
hourglass lip gloss and child and he is
one of the prettiest nude lip glosses
that ever existed and I really ever seen
anyone using it ever it is I love to
sleek packaging it's like skinny and
strange and that has this nice fat doe
foot applicator anyway this is such a
pretty color I think it's just one of
the best glosses around and no one uses
it than me at least of how I feel you
know okay next let's talk about this
contour palette from B&amp;amp;H FL agh doesn't
get too too much love and they actually
have a lot of great products so here's
here's the palette I'm not going to lie
it has a lot of warm tome shades that I
probably won't use but I adore this
shade right here and these two shades
are fabulous they are so incredibly
pigmented you could take your Beauty
Blender rub
and this and literally baked your face
with this products because they're so
pigmented I love setting my concealer
with these and then I love contouring
with this guy right here it's a very
nice palette and as most of you know BH
is a really affordable makeup brand so
it's hot it's also a great fan all right
next is in glide implied oh my gosh no
one talks about engli enough I don't
really ever see them work with beauty
bloggers and that may be the reason why
I don't know they may work with beauty
bloggers my just missed it but I feel
like that's why they're not talked about
enough so they're pigments are some of
the previous pigments that ever existed
and every time I wear one someone asked
me what is on my eyes so the first one
is number 286 I kind of wish I had a
sister on it it doesn't it's definitely
duochrome it's like green pinkish color
it's kind of strange
absolutely the camera is not really
doing it the justice that I really want
the camera to do it but it's such a cool
pigment hm I wear this one people are
like baffled by what I have on my eyes
it's such a cool pigment and then this
one is just a bronzy one it's not a very
unique color but just quality of the
makeup and the pigment is unreal I know
they're always like at IMATS and trade
show so if you're ever able to snag some
go for I mean seriously look at that
 ah that is so pretty like that's
unreal that looks like a little bucket
of gold I just want to bathe my whole
body in it and just wear it around town
next up Tarte is it's a price this is a
brand that gets talked about a lot a lot
of people have a love a lot a little bit
of look a lot of people have a lot of
love for Tarte as do I think you're a
great brand this product by Tarte
isolate doesn't get that much love and
it's one of my mom's favorite
foundations so I think it's a great for
mature skin and it really works well for
her I also love it it is this the double
duty so it's called double duty
foundation gel foundation is such a cool
foundation it comes in this little pod
it has like a strange smell to but it
smells so good at the same time and it
has a gel formula so it blends out very
easy medium coverage you can definitely
build it up and it's double duty so it
lasts so long throughout the
day because f at gel light formula I
find it it doesn't seep into the small
line so that's something that you're
battling but you want more coverage
still this will be a great option for
you I really love the double duty line
from Tarte it doesn't get talked about
that much but it is some of the greatest
okay
medium neutral is the shade that I am
wearing not that I am wearing but that I
wear okay next up is by Kerry cosmetics
this is a highlighting palette and I
don't hear a lot talked about carroty
cosmetics as it is it's kind of rising
the honest option Beverly Hills
highlight palette but this is such a
pretty product of the pigmentation I
find that they work the very best
whenever you wet your face first or wet
the brush first and then you really get
like a lot of pigmentation but like
they're very creamy filling they feel
very like wet not dry and chalky and
they are so pigmented but you really get
that like hardcore glow out of these
whenever you just like spritz your face
with the mac fix+ or you dampen your
brush with it or whatever it may be this
is my favorite way to wear them but
they're so pigmented in general and I
never saw this brand talked about lastly
is some buxom eyeshadows I have quite a
few of these little palettes they have a
bunch of different ones but I really
love this one and I really love the
pigmentation and quality of their
eyeshadows let me just show you some
swatch of Rosie's so pretty and look at
the color scheme is beautiful so they
have really great quality matte
eyeshadows as do they shimmers and I
never really here oh my god that's
unreal that's unreal that's buxom
eyeshadows right there how beautiful is
that you know I just don't hear talked
about enough and even their setups and
their palettes are beautiful they put
good mass and good shimmers together and
they make great palette I need to be
using the brand on camera more myself
but and I definitely will work on doing
that but those are products that I just
think are absolutely outstanding and
they don't get the love of you guys
enjoyed this video and I hope it opened
your eyes to maybe some new products

you in mom
