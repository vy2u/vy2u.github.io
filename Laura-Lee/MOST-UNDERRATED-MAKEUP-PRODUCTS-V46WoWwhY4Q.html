today's video is going to be talking
about products that are underrated now I
normally do my overrated makeup products
but you guys actually requested in that
video which I will gladly link right
down below but you guys requested for me
to talk about products that are a little
bit underrated maybe they don't get
talked about so much but are really good
products so I'm going to do that for you
guys today also I'm doing a humongo
about your school giveaway so be sure to
enter that I will also link that video
down below it has two rules in it giving
away a MacBook I'm giving away Apple
watching so much more so just be sure
and enter and so now we're going to jump
in I've got a little bit of skin care
some hair care and as well as makeup of
course and we're gonna jump right in and
get started first product we're going to
talk about is by makeup revolution so I
recently got this highlight and a good
resolution is a brand that's not talked
about too much on the internet I think
it's a newer brand I'm not really 100%
sure I could be making that up
completely famous is sold at Ulta and so
I had gotten this highlight from them
where's my little brush looks like this
it's very pretty and I like to take my
brush I normally skip the deeper bronze
edge I will tell you that the highlight
is a little bit powdery per se not so
much of a creamy buttery texture but a
little bit powdery but the color payoff
of it is crazy good and it looks so
beautiful on the skin so this is
something I've really never seen talked
about on the internet and it definitely
needs to be because highlights are
poppin nowadays by the way this is
called shimmer brick radiance next
product I want to talk about is by pixie
Beauty so this is their bronzer this is
one of my favorite products that pixie
makes this is their shape and shadow
bronzer so this is for shaping
contouring you could even use it as an
eyeshadow shade but the thing that I
love most about it
not only is the quality of the powder
but I love the shade for it it's so good
it's like that nice gray undertone to it
so it's really nice for contouring your
face whenever I contour I really keep
away from orangie undertone at things
because I feel like it makes your face
look orange versus contoured and
structured whenever you get to the
cooler gray undertone things it just
looks so much more natural and this is a
good drug
for this is a good drugstore buy and you
get a lot of product it's pretty pretty
big guys they're the exact same size
same manufacturer I don't think it's the
same manufacturer but would you look at
that my next product I want to mention
to you guys is a product that recently
launched from pure cosmetics and I think
pur cosmetics is such a great brand
they're not talked about too much on the
internet and they definitely should be
so I'm going to show them some love in
this video this is the pure love your
selfie 2 palette so this is a second
version of this palette last year they
came out with the first version of the
palette and the palettes about loving
yourself loving the special things about
you loving your individual ality and I
adored that about the palette so it's a
really good deal and not only that pur
gives you gives you guys 20% off their
whole entire site including this palette
so it's a good price range for what you
get you get a mini mascara which i
absolutely adore the fully charged
mascara it's a good one I actually have
two of these for whatever reason and
I've pretty much used up my mini mascara
in it so I figured I'd pull out the
freshman one to showcase it to you guys
but then you get a lip liner as well as
a gloss
I have swatched these and they feel very
creamy I have not worn them because they
are a little bit of a deeper fallish
time color so I will get into these to
the liner and the gloss whenever we get
into like October November I'm trying to
live out my summer nude lip for as long
as I can you guys know I'm addicted to
it and you also get a highlight called
overexposed photogenic I blush in
composition which is a bronzer so I like
the bronzer a lot to bronze at my face I
do not contour my face with this bronzer
because it is that more of that warm G
undertone to it so it's great for really
warming up your skin versus actually
creating structure do you see the
difference in color between the two
bronzers there I am in the mirror and
then you get eight eyeshadow shades it's
a nice palette and you just give it like
a big bang for your buck next product
that doesn't get talked about a lot is
Kardashian beauty and I do know that
some of the products are hit and miss I
have like a bunch of their new line if
you guys want me to review that let me
know down in the comment
I just don't know like I just wanna know
what you guys want to see what do you
want for me haha I do want to know like
if you would be interested in seeing
that anyway so I got this palette and
they came out with three versions of it
this brush is disgusting and I don't
know what's in it favorite one is the
work it um palette the other two I it's
great quality but I don't like the
shades in it so I don't really wouldn't
really use it it barely touched it it is
so pigmented that it's scary the blush
color is stunning like I am addicted to
a ma B rose color and then the
eyeshadows have the exact same quality
as the highlight so I just watched this
one too many times but it's just like
super pigmented if you can see that like
they're just crazy pigmented so I think
this is such a beautiful palette and I
love the color scheme in this one I
think these are sold at Ulta next part
so I want to mention to you guys is
another palette this is by Studio makeup
on the go
so I've tampered with Studio makeup a
little bit I've used their blushes
before and I liked them a lot but then I
got this little eye shadow palette it's
kind of resembles the Chi palette hmm
pala is actually called warm up this
palette is not available on the site yet
but will be in the September boxycharm
so you're going to get this full I
should have held it in that boxycharm
box I'll leave that link down below as
well I love the color scheme I love it I
love this caramel brown and then you
even get like a topi Brown and then you
get three shimmers and a lot of great
mass I think this would be an amazing
go-to palette for the fall time
beautiful and studio makeup is not
talked about a lot whatsoever and it
definitely should be it's a good brand
next up I want to mention to you guys a
lipstick that is shaped like a bullet I
got this at the famous but I walk by
this booth and I'm trying to remember
lunatic labs it's the name of the brand
and the like the cosmetic brand I
never heard them before but their booth
was really cool and they were dressed up
like hairless cats the people sell them
stuff so of course I immediately went
over there and immediately started pet
petting the woman at the booth I started
petting her head oh he's so cool so this
is the ak-47 lipstick which I only
bought one of them I wish I had bought
more I just
know about the brand so I was like it
feels like I'll just take one this is
this pretty mommy purpley like gray
lipstick which again I'm not getting
ready for fall fat people but this would
be beautiful front of all time I adore
it
the quality of the lipstick is like it's
matte but it's so pigmented and pretty
on the lips so I do love love love this
lunatic Cosmetics lunatic labs I think
that's what's called I want to mention
to you guys buys you way
my favorite thing is when people call
this jabber I did the exact same thing
when I first saw the brand I was like
that our brand soju a means to play in
French it's a French like themed brand
anyways this is the matte moisture tint
with sunscreen in it and I am NOT a
moisture tint girl I am NOT a BB cream
girl whatsoever I am girl give me that
full coverage foundation because I'm not
playing games today this is a moisture
tint that I do like because like I go to
the beach or I'm just out I'm in a hot
atmosphere where that full coverage
makeup is gonna start melting I do
occasionally opt for something like this
and this is my favorite version of a BB
cream or moisture tint and it's my
favorite but it because it has quite a
bit of coverage to it can build it up I
mean if you put on a small layer it's
not going to be full coverage but you
can really build it up so if you can see
that is it like look at that matte so
they actually have a glossy one which I
don't care about something all about the
Malak that's insane coverage I think
g'way is really kind of up and coming
and pushing through the beauty community
so yeah I think you'll hear about them a
lot more the product I want to talk
about is the Marc Jacobs this is their
new airbrush I hasn't been talked about
too much I've seen on the internet
they're so pretty I'm wearing it today
it's like a little color a little little
hint of color this one is kink and
kisses and I feel so incredibly silky it
feels like a satin blush lots of color
payoff I opted for using more of this in
it versus the lighter end because this
in compliment my skin tone a little bit
more this is the only one of these that
I have but I do love kinking kisses it's
kind of been like my go-to blush lately
and so I definitely thought I would take
the time
to you guys what is next we have a Jana
Stiles I believe that's how you say it
I'm not sure I never hear about this
brand and I don't even know that much
about it but I do like this product so
I'm gonna tell you about it this is
called galaxy way this is the radiant
aqua ival so this product is like a
cream eyeshadow base or just a cream
eyeshadow I've had another one of these
and I liked it a lot and you just take
like a dot and it gives you just a
little bit of playtime but then it does
dry okay that dot basically covered my
whole hand but how beautiful just take a
dot on your brush or your finger and pet
it out on your eyelid and blend out your
transition one and done it would be a
beautiful eye look especially for a
nighttime look it's so pretty it's like
charcoal it's called galaxy way but I
love it some bowling okay so for our
first skincare product I want to mention
to you
Caudle this is a new product from me
like this isn't something I've been
using for months I just started using it
and I've really been liking it and I
picked this up while I was in New York a
few months ago I think it's pronounced
coddled Paris I'm probably making that
up this is a beauty elixir it's for
smoothing glowing complexion and you can
use this under your makeup you can put
this on before you buy your much
moisturizer on top of your moisturizer
and it settles really gross I'll be
honest with you so I give it a shake
every time I use it so it's supposed to
tighten the appearance of pores as well
as smooth out the skin and give you a
little bit of a glow and all those
things just sounds so great to me but it
has a really strong scent to is very I
don't even know how to describe the
scent but I don't like the scent to it
but I love the actual product so you
don't smell it on your face throughout
the day you just smell it whenever you
spray it so I'm okay with this then I
can live with that
give it two more smells like my
grandma's basement prodded by tatcha I
have been loving
I love Tasha altogether Patrick Starr
kind of got me hooked on the brand and
once I started using it it's hard for me
to go back from it I think it's an
amazing skincare brand is a Japanese
brand
and this is their poor perfecting water
gel moisturizer so I'm all about water
or gel moisturizers it's hard for me to
use a cream moisturizer because every
single time that I do I end up with
something like this oh that's the wrong
side of my face this okay well I covered
it well with makeup but that is a
boulder on my face and it's because I
used a cream moisturizer for like three
days in a row and I knew it was gonna I
knew it was coming like I was like
where's my SID at because my skin was so
dry I have to remember just to stick
with my gel or water moisturizers um and
this one I've been using it is so good
it's something very lightweight I do two
pumps in my palm I wrote my pumps
together and I moisturize my skin and
then I'm getting real fancy with it I do
two more pumps and I start dragging it
down the neck in the chest area love it
and then lastly something I don't hear
talked about from way now I know you
guys have heard of the Haier brand way
probably it's by Jen Atkins which was
the Kardashian's hair stylist which I
think she still sells their hair some
but I know she's got a lot going for her
now with whey is the finishing cream now
everybody talks about the hairspray the
texture is cream and the dry shampoo but
I never hear the finishing cream talked
about I just think that's dirty you know
but I love this product I actually have
it in my hair right now and Justine
Marjan which is the Kardashians she just
Chloe's hair a lot
I'm hair stylist she actually did my
hair and she used the cream and taught
me how to use it and I fell in love with
it so it's for like whenever you want
like this slick look I have it all
throughout the front of my hair I just
put some in my hands rub it through and
take my brush and comb it through and it
will tackle the edges like there's no
tomorrow
it will tie down those baby hairs that
try to take over everything so if you
like the sleek Kardashian fun or like
the look I have now this is like bomb
calm product you don't be scared of it
it's like putting lotion in your hair
but then it dries it dries nice like
it's not goofy or crusty doesn't get the
white flakes in it and like overdoing
the hairspray and all will do this won't
do that so it's a good good good good
hair product I definitely recommend to
you guys guys so that is it for this
video I feel like I talked
forever in a day but I think it's good
for us to talk together to love one
there hmm nice compliment somebody today
I love you guys and I'll see you on my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
