what channel so today's video is super
exciting because Maya Tripathy has
officially launched it is officially for
sale right now I have to link down below
if you guys want to purchase it and I
can't believe the day is here I can't
believe I'm saying this because I'm pre
filming this like two days early so I'm
saying it this is not true but it is
true whenever the video is live so I'm
really really excited about it
I'm excited today because my last two
makeup tutorials I did with the palace a
little bit more intricate with a cut
crease and then using multiple colors
because I wanted to show you guys how to
use all the colors and Duk dip into all
the colors of the palette during doing
tutorials that most of my comments in my
last video was asking will my next
tutorial with the palette be in every
day makeup tutorial so that way people
can see how to use the palette day in
and day out maybe not so much whenever
they want to do a fancy smancy look so I
thought what a great idea you guys
always have the best ideas so here we
are I'm gonna be filming just a natural
everyday makeup tutorial even a makeup
tutorial that I've done with the palette
several times you can also wear this to
school work whatever you got going on in
your life this is a great neutral way to
use the palette so hope you guys are
excited I'm super excited about it out
further ado let's sing a little song
shall we and we'll go ahead and jump
right into the video
that was a good tongue pop
I've been trying to grow them out this
as far as I've gotten and the big
growing out for the gears I envy people
I truly many people have long big bushy
beautiful eyebrows I envy you we're
gonna do the eyes which are not gonna be
that difficult to do is gonna be super
easy peasy lemon squeezy and also we're
not gonna be doing mascara today that's
we are gonna be doing mascara we're not
gonna be doing false lashes
you guys are like great no mascara weird
first we are going to take okie dokie
which is the cream bone shade in the
palette is a matte shade is used in two
different ways I personally like to use
it to soften on my eyeshadow primer I
have I'm a Mac I have a Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre applied all over my eyes and
I like to do this because it becomes a
bit sticky and a little bit hard to
blend out the other shades so I like to
put this powder on top because it sets
the Paint Pot and it makes it way easier
to blend the other colors that we're
gonna apply but this color is great if
you is if you can see it's kind of
translucent like it's not that bold but
if you build it up with a flat synthetic
brush you can get this bone shade on
your lid I've done it in my previous
tutorial using it but you're not really
gonna get much building up of this color
using any type of fluffy blending brush
and more so just disperse the product
like it did my hair right there I'm
gonna take an fi 1 9 which is a little
bit of a longer blender and I'm going to
take the shade bomb diggity which is a
great neutral brown color a great
transition shade and I'm just going to
poke it in the outer corner like that I
can I go back and forth I like to build
up color on the outer corner mostly
because I find that it makes the eyes
give it giving it a light effect if that
makes any sense which is kind of just
opens up the eyes a little bit and the
more open that the eyes are I find that
they look a little bit more awake and a
little more fresh so I like to keep my
bolder colors right there at the end
I just left the gym and literally I'm
dead serious not being a wussy but
holding up my arm blending is literally
hurting so bad because my arms too like
jello right now so I'm like trying to
blend I'm like oh my god it hurts
geez I feel like a weakling I'm gonna
take just a touch of cray-cray this is a
warmer orange undertone caramel a brown
shade and I'm just gonna add a bit of
that to the tip of my brush Craig Wright
is extremely pigmented so if you don't
want it to if you don't want to apply to
too much of it I would just go in with a
lighter hand with it and do smaller
motions with it that way you're not
dispersing the color like crazy like
Craig Craig and this can just deepen up
the look you actually can stop at
bomb-diggity if you want to if you want
to deepen it up just a little bit more
you can add a little cry cry and these
colors sit very well with one another
and they build up on each other so
nicely now I have enough color built up
on my eyes I just applied the two Browns
on the outer corner and I kind of left
this area a little more clean because
we're gonna add a shimmer which can
really make our eyes pop and look like
we put a lot of effort into look but
it's super simple to do so
so scatterbrain is also really pretty
scatterbrains also really pretty
everyday option but I've used it in some
tutorials so I really want to go into
redonkulous which is a little bit more
of a bronzey color but it's very
wearable bronze it's not too deep so you
can apply this with your finger which is
what I'm gonna do it is not wet and it
is extremely pigmented it's almost
metallic it's so pigmented
it kind of stopped whenever we had a
quarter of the I left with the brown
shade started I'm more feet em three to
six brush which is tiny I'm gonna take
some scatterbrain I am gonna dampen the
color to enhance it you can use water
today I'm going to use a little bit of
my mac fix+ spray which just really
enhances shimmery pigments and I'm gonna
apply this on the inner corner you won't
believe how applying a color like this
on the inner corner will truly open up
the is so much and just bring you back
to life whenever you're feeling tired
when I also apply a little bit of this
color to the brow bone which yes we
stood we still to draw on these eyebrows
don't worry I have not forgotten them I
know they are looking sparse because my
lashes aren't that thick and I
personally have always worn a little bit
of liner my whole entire life I'm just
got a little bit of liner not lying or
excuse me
a little bit of dark I show this as
oddball it's a black shade and I'm going
to take an angled brush and just get
some on the tip of the brush right there
and then what I'm gonna do is kind of
keep it towards the outer corner that
way the look isn't too smoky and
honestly this cuts down on time as well
not lining the whole eye I need to get
my mirror real close honey so I see what
I'm doin okay so what I like to do is
just nudge it in that outer corner
I took my eye I don't recommend doing
this it's really bad for your skin but
do as I say not as I do with ki next up
I'm going to fill in the sparse areas
with my brows I'm gonna try not to film
in as bold as I normally do that's more
for the kake glam look with false lashes
and if you like sometimes whenever I
make them too too bold and don't put on
false lashes they're just overpowering
so I'm trying to try to just fill in the
sparse areas I use the shade number four
in this pencil and I always like to comb
them up to start like this brow is a
little bold but not as bold as I
normally draw them in like I went in
with a lighter hand when filling them in
so I'm gonna do the same thing over here
and then we're gonna do some mascara
we have eyebrows next I'm going to curl
my lashes this is just a tweezerman
eyelash curler I'm gonna give them a
good curl and now I'm think I'm gonna
apply today the Marc Jacobs velvet new
or this has just been such a good
mascara for so long if you're looking
for a drugstore option I think this is
somewhat similar and I like this a lot
so I'll probably mix in a bit of the
L'Oreal lash paradise super good
drugstore mascara
and of course my life just want to play
games and now they want to go straight
again so once they're dry I'm gonna hit
it one more time with the curl the
ongoing struggle that I do just don't
know this is why I'm addicted to false
lashes because my real lashes don't do
much for me if you've great relations
you ever put a false lashes on attained
your life okay
primer today Oh primer today I'm going
to be using the velvet blurring primer
so this is if you have to shake it well
and it's a primer buy it sucka I think
it's a new one I just recently got it
and it looks peachy kind of like this
and I just like to apply it right here
is super blurring so it doesn't help
with acne or big pores but does help to
fill them in and to give it a soften
blur effect I do have this stupid thing
in my forehead and that is because I
like to pick any little bump or is it
that I get I'm just like I create more a
creative problem that isn't there like
it was a tiny bump and then I picked it
to the up and now it's like this huge
monstrosity today for foundation I'm
gonna be using with my favorite everyday
foundation and this is the Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless I'm in shade
220
I like this foundation for so long it
just hasn't steered me wrong so I'm
gonna keep using her it's such a good
everyday foundation I'm gonna take a
fresh why six brush from morphe and
start to blend this product out oh my
god there's powder on this oh my god no
I can't use this so we're gonna take the
y7 which is the one that's a little more
rounded this is just sinful but this
brush actually isn't clean and many was
using it to put white liquid lipstick
all over his face and there's white
liquid lipstick on it right now and we
almost just had a huge accident on my
face
not good
if you can see out of what did the under
eye area a little bit and that's because
I'm gonna apply a concealer sometimes
whenever you take your foundation all
the way up to the top of the under-eye
and put a thick concealer or a bunch of
concealer on top of it it becomes a lot
of makeup and you can get a little crazy
so I try to avoid the under-ice
sometimes but whenever I'm gonna apply a
lot of concealer because I don't want it
to get crazy so today I'm gonna be using
the NARS creamy radiant I've just been
on such a kick with this concealer I use
it every single day I'm just gonna take
the same brush and blend it on out by
doing stippling motions I prefer to
blend back and forth back and forth I
find that helps gets in every little
crevice on the under eye oh girl
blend it honey
whenever you put down a cream product I
just highly recommend no matter what you
said it so I'm just gonna put a little
bit of loose translucent setting powder
on the concealer and just gonna lock it
in place and make sure it doesn't go
anywhere and I'll also make it lasts so
much longer throughout the day to bronze
in my skin I love using the hoola
bronzer it's a great bronzing shade and
I'm gonna use the e53 brush you can
contour if you want to but I really just
like to take the bronzer kind of around
like this and warm up my face a little
bit cuz I feel like after I put on all
the powder and concealer my face is just
looking so dead and it needs some needs
a little bit of bronzing bring you back
to life some color
I love bronze on my forehead right here
just hit it around the temples and kind
of push it into the hairline and then
I'll bring it on around
I'm gonna take one of my favorite
blushes that I just can't quit use them
this is a peach Primrose I think I
caught it peach promise I have selective
reading in one of my favorites videos so
it's peach Primrose by flower beauty and
someone asked me is to soul that target
I have not seen this at Target
whatsoever so I don't think so I think
it's only at Walmart
for highlight today I'm going to take
Bali by Oprah if you can see it is gold
but it has I don't know if you can tell
on camera but has like a pink to it is
very pretty and I'm gonna take my r36
brush wherever it might be hiding here
she is
and I'm just gonna hit it hit it on
those cheekbones honey
ah so great
I'm gonna mix together the two brown
shades next and we're gonna sweep these
on the under I kind of hit them connect
them right there at the corner of that
outer corner right there and if you
connect these colors you can give you a
really pretty put together smokey kind
of look but without much effort at all
I'm now gonna go back in with oddball
which is the black color and just right
there on this outer corner right here
connect that corner and just bring it in
a quarter of the way really close to the
lower lashes next I'm going to take a
nude liner this one is from pretty
vulgar I'm gonna pop it right into my
waterline I find that nude liners just
make your eye look so big round open and
fresh they do so much for your eye go to
a really dark sultry look I typically
stick with a black liner but whenever I
want a daytime or a lighter look nude as
where's that I'm going to add some of
the lash paradise from L'Oreal to my
lower lashes
I love Messier on the lower lashes and
spider like the spider II look I think
it looks so pretty I just burned my arm
hair off there's a candle sitting way
too close to me why is everything going
so crazy in this video
oh wait does every video where my lips
I'm gonna let my lips was stripped on my
Mac this is just a lip pencil it's a
really pretty brown neutral
next I'm gonna take version version
version from morphe this is one third
liquid lipsticks I'm just going to apply
it into the center of the lips if you
can see I've already lined my lips in
the outer corners of it with the brown
shade so applying a color like this in
the center really helps to make the lips
look a little bit plumper lastly I'm
gonna set all of my makeup
and that is it for this look guys is
such an easy simple look to do
don't forget cats pajamas is now for
sale that was really annoying at larlie
