video it's going to be very very tiny
video because I'm finally gonna be
talking about my palette let's take some
IDs fell off my other palette in
collaboration and I'm just so excited
about it that I don't know what to do
with myself honestly this is like a
complete dream come true I can't believe
it's here I can't believe we are almost
ready to launch so jumping right into
this video let me tell you the launch
date the pre-sale launch day is June
10th at 10 a.m. PST time so be sure mark
your calendars and I'll put it on the
screen somewhere it will have a full
release day on June 23rd same time and I
mix so except for this it's awesome
you're gonna be at Fame Expo LA we will
be selling the palette there that is the
first Saturday and June I don't know the
exact date off the top of my head but
you know it'll be on the screen
somewhere okay I got you covered
don't be sure mark your calendars for
those days and there's time or enjoy
partying and talk about the palette okay
it's a box
I designed the box of the palette by the
balls palettes normally come in black
packaging but I was like we're going
special edition 100% we're going to do
the opposite white packaging then it has
my paint splash it's like on the banner
of my channel as well as the fonts and
then it says violet boss X laura-leigh
if you do get this palette and create a
look or want to post about it be sure
and use the hashtag but I let Voss
explore Lee so I can see your pictures
I'll be surfing that hashtag like
craziness because I don't want to what
you doing will compile a tocar side of
the palette it says by the boss ex Laura
Lee and then on the back of the palette
and so what's special it's going to say
it's going to have the paint
flash and it has just a nice little
saying that I wrote it says hey guys
thank you so much for being a part of
this palette with me I work so hard
creating the perfect go-to palette with
a little sass this palette is a dream
come true and I could have be happier
with the outcome I hope you enjoy it
just as much as I do and I true
I mean those words so it also has a
little picture of me with my signature
on the picture in my name and I YouTube
channel and my Instagram handle oh my
hair um my hair will not be included in
the palette you will get your palette it
will be all bubble wrap that way is safe
and sound we do not need any broken
eyeshadows and this is what the front of
the palette will look like I think it's
really cool because the paint splash you
see it shiny um and then it just says
bother boss explore leave I mean you're
gonna know it's my palette okay we did
not mess around Lorelai
and here she is here she is here four
little babies I love you every time I
look at her I'm like yes bitch we're
about to slay together lunch um this is
my child I love her I look at her all
the time and I'm just like I'm so proud
of you when creating this palette mind
you I've never created eyeshadow palette
or collabed or anything like that before
my wife so I was very scared but I had a
few things that it had to 100% be the
palette had to be great for everyone
with a deeper skin tone with a lighter
skin tone whoever you are out there
medium purple pink whatever your skin
tone is I want you to be able to rock
this palette now give it a had 20 chase
to create and made the job a little bit
easier to do that however like putting
20 shades in a palette and have the
palette like makes sense and not be like
all over the place and just look good
together that was challenging and then I
also wanted the palette to make sense I
wanted it to be like larlie colors this
is my palette that I created like it
cannot be a bunch of cool tone colors I
don't wear cool cool colors though I was
like there's going to be a good bit of
warmth homes but I kept some cool tones
down the box you can incorporate a cool
tone look with this palette so that was
something else that was extremely
important to me I want it I mean I
didn't want to put in there shades that
I never wear that would be so bizarre so
it's very important for me for the
palette to represent me as well look
great on anybody who purchase it I'm not
gonna lie that was very challenging
because I don't know how I'm gonna do
this but I've got to make it happen when
there's a will there is a way and that
is a saying my mother has always told me
the last thing this palette had to be it
had to be a palette where you could
create multiple full-load without
reaching for another eyeshadow because I
travel so much and do so much and I just
need to pack a palette but I never
cannot pack this palette in that palette
and this palette or this single
eyeshadow with this palette to make sure
I can get my 110% full look out of it
and so this I just needed it to be the
nitty-gritty like I needed it to be the
go-to just you can pack this maybe you
are good to go great but I think it came
together so well in it when I looked at
it the finished product sounds like wow
it happened we did it like this is it so
now let's just talk about the shade
names which are very special to me by
the balls early are you going to name
each and every shade and I was like you
bet your dollar I am as you notice the
shades kind of go lighter at the top and
then darker towards the bottom I think
they look nice in the palette place like
that I will show you many tutorials on
how I use the shadows but our first
shade is basics and I named this shade
basic because it is a very basic
eyeshadow shade but it is very mandatory
on any eyeshadow powder palette I have I
want to have this shake matte cream
color and it's amazing for the brow bone
it's great to soften up that eyeshadow
primer it's great to pack on the lid for
a beautiful cut crease basic it is in it
such a basic color but can be used in so
many ways then let's move on to sugar
now if you say sugar please do not for
the ER on that that is sugar in the most
southern way that you can cite it now
this shade is a little bit of a soft
light champagne a highlight shade
I used to shake in my inner corner twink
my eye pop as well as pop it on the brow
bones to get those Rebels a lip and
really tie your whole eye look together
should it is really
other mandatory little baby for me okay
next it's Priss
Chris pond is a southern saying you're
just a Priss PAH you're prissy
you rain Chrissy your pisspot is a light
orange color and it's a little bit scary
looking Julie I don't want orange upon
my eye but once you blend it out I wear
Prescott every day I haven't blend it in
my crease I personally use this shade to
soften up my eyeshadow primer so my
other colors blend nicely and I also use
it to store a warm transition shade it's
good this is mama bird mama bird is a
name that I call my mother
and I'll just call mom or mama call mama
bird um and again it's kind of a
southern thing for those of you don't
know I'm from Alabama and I moved to
California two years ago so you can take
the girl out of Alabama but you can't
take album s out of the girl mama it's a
little bit more of a fun orange e color
I love oranges because I'm telling you
if you blend them in the crease really
nicely it just warms up the look it
doesn't necessarily come up as orange
especially if you layer colors with it
so this is just another great transition
shade to keep a warm tone look and then
we move on to a ragamuffin which is this
other way of saying the word ratchet if
someone's looking a little ratchet you
say ragamuffin and I thought what a cute
name then all these are just southern
thing he knows how about supplying it to
you real wail now this one is a bright
orange look so this one definitely is
going to come off more orange then
really blend it into like a deep brown
to me this one just comes off more
orange E and I will show you how I
incorporate this in a look beautiful
especially for the summertime honey
beautiful beautiful beautiful okay now
we have larlie larlie it looks so simple
it looks just like a shimmery light
color but really larlie is a name that I
call my subscribers I call you guys
Laura Lee's by the way that's where the
name came from and also it is an
iridescent color so it's like champagne
but pink but champagne but pink and then
you can get subpoena you're like wait
and it does champagne so it's kind of
duochrome it's got a little bit of both
in it really great color you could use
it for the brow bone I like to pack it
onto the lid as a shimmery color it's
quite lovely
next is tickled pink I will be honest
with you tickled pink was the first
color I chose for this palette such a
gorgeous color and took the pink as one
of those go to colors for me personally
that if I need to do a makeup look and
I'm going to be in an event or something
tickled pink would be my go-to color or
to wear every day packed onto the lid
tickled pink is so pigmented it's crazy
it's almost like a coiled metally color
more than a shimmery it's incredibly
pigmented it makes your eyes like glow
pop is beautiful and it has like a very
very slight pink undertone to it so
tickled pink and by the way the name
tickled pink is a southern science for
I'm excited I'm just helping write hissy
fit whenever you're throwing a bitch-fit
in the south wayside hissy fit so I
named the next color this this is a
broad golden color and I have to have
this color incorporated in my everyday
life a golden bronze color will look
beautiful on anyone mark my words
beautiful on anyone I'm going to show
you how I rock this one in a tutorial
it's so freakin creamy and buttery and
beautiful next is biti biti is a short
term for saying bitch it's a nice way of
being like stop being a bitty stop being
a bitch bitty is a coppery color again I
think it's absolutely amazing for summer
or fall depending on how you blend it
out with your Brown I really think it
makes the eyes pop I think anyone can
also pull off pity on to their eyelids
spoke down underneath the eyes hot 1988
is a year I was born which brings us to
the next color which is a lot of
people's favorite color
completely understanding why this is one
of my favorite colors in the palette as
well it's like a fiery pink with a gold
undertone to it so it's a duo promise a
little bit of both it has like this
golden sparkle within this fiery color
but then it has like this rose
rose-gold pink in it it's a lot of
things packed into one and I personally
think is an extremely unique color
I have bitty and 1988 packed on my lid
right now and as you can see it just
looks a little bit of a fiery pink in
that Center obsession that can we move
on to flaky um I was gonna name the
color fleet or like humfleet but I was
like that's getting kind of basic now so
let me do that slowly little sass in it
okay anyways this is a gold color but I
felt like we had hissy fit that was
already gold so I wanted a nice goal
with a really yellow undertone to it I
can just imagine have my hair back in a
really tight knot with some big dramatic
earrings and like this yellow gold
across my lid looks so absolutely
amazing and I want to create that look
this is breeches and breeches in the
southern white Si and pants and this is
another stable color I have to have in
any palette because if you don't want to
use a crisp pot as a transition shapes
with little too warm for you use
breeches it is such an awesome ups of
light brown color which looks like I
said we going on any skin tone for a
transition shade you have to have a good
transition shade of palette and breeches
is your girl it's a nice tan matte color
I fried it's such a unique color to me
it's my favorite matte in the palette
it's a brown but it has a slight yellow
undertone I think fried is a very unique
color and fried looks like a fried piece
of chicken let's be real you get a
golden fried piece of chicken it looks
like fried I'm so that's what inspired
the name behind it and we fry everything
in the south well at least my mom did
growing us so that's fried and I always
put britches on and put fried on top of
it just to get my transition shade a
little bit of pizzazz like more than
just that tan color these blend out so
easy and beautifully you'll see in my
tutorials next we have Yoshii Yoshii
looks a little bit like a great color in
the palette but is a shimmery to Tom
gray so it like has this a little bit of
a green blue to a straight-on it looks
like a nice soft gray color which will
be beautiful on your eyelid
and then we have rammer jammer so if for
those of you who don't know I'm obsessed
with Alabama football that's kind of
what you do in the cell if you like pick
a team and then you fall in love with it
and rammer jammer is a term that
Alabamians used for our football team
our colors for Alabama is crimson so I
have a nice shimmery cranberry crimson
shade which I wear probably two days out
of the week I go for maroon tone look on
my eyes I think it's so flattering and
beautiful how to have that I'm crimson
shade next is Alabama Alabama is your
nice warm tone brown is brown with a red
undertone to it it looks like Alabama
clay actually so I think that's what
inspired me to name it Alabama I always
use this in my crease out of it my
crease right now next is whiskers
whiskers is an expresso shade it's a
warm brown shade but it's deep enough I
have it blend it in my outer corners
right now to really smoke out your outer
corners it's such a great matte shade
for that I named it whiskers because cat
whiskers and I'm a crazy cat lady make
no mistake about that we're on my son
guys we have bubs which is a deeper more
cool toned deep brown color but if you
want it to offer a more cool toned look
you could blend breeches and bubs and
basic together and you would have a nice
soft cool tone I look so you get a full
ton cools on look at this majority warm
home palette - and bubs is what I call
my husband I don't know why or where the
name came from but I just home bugs next
is a color a lot of people are excited
about as well as me and it seems
smashley smashley as a name it's my
sister's alter ego my sister's name is
Ashley whenever she gets a little
cray-cray with color smashley
and this color couldn't represent her
anymore the color is crazy because let
me tell you I post it of course pictures
of this on my Instagram and stuff and
everybody calls this color if you
I've heard it be called green
four-screen emerald til bright blue it
is super super duochrome color this is
color is packed so many colors into one
and like I just read through the
comments I'm like oh my god I'm actually
has been called like 10 different shades
because it's everybody's eye sees the
color a little bit different I see it as
a porn screen with a little bit of a
till flash in it I'm going to wear like
a color color like purple blue green
green would be my option like green is
my color if I had to pick between the
one I think green is a really subtle way
of incorporating color into your look
and I absolutely had to have it in my
palette and lastly make them take about
it and I'm sure Pat as Lilly has to have
black has got black it's going to have a
black choice blue is my black little
kitty cat and I named the black color
loo after my cat but is it extremely
extremely extremely pigmented shade and
you need to go in very very light hand
it with a shade I warned you so you get
a very large mirror and the palette
which is awesome and then it says boss X
laura-leigh right here on the top and
how I use this palette because it flips
all the way over so can being Healy I
set it on my hand like this and whenever
I'm doing my eyeshadow I'm right handed
so I will literally hold it like this
and hold it like an artist book and
literally just blend to the heaven just
and that is the rundown on the palette
palette cost $45 there is shipping cost
on the palette it is cruelty free
but overall the palette is pretty large
pan I think 45 bucks is a great price
for 20 eyeshadow shades and mind you the
pan to the eye shows are pretty
gosh-darn large I have been using my
palette day in and day out for month
like only my palette and I have
hit pan on any of the shades because
they're so incredibly pigmented that a
little goes an extremely long way and
you won't have to use a lot of your
shade and not only that the pans are not
tiny squares whatsoever they are the
standard violet Voss pan size but it's a
large nice hand side I'm obsessed with
the palette like I'm so excited about it
whenever I first want to picture on it
on Instagram you guys brought me down to
tears I don't cry that easy and I was
literally crying because you're it's so
scary
I'm with people's feedback you know what
if everybody hated it and I worked so
hard to create this like that my nerves
were on in and then I released the first
picture of it and the feedback just
flooded so much love and kindness it
brought me to tears all that being said
thank you guys so much here for the love
and support
remember the launch dates June 10th June
23rd 10 a.m. PST I hope everybody that
once one is able to get one dot by the
vows calm is where you can get it and of
course I'll do tutorials with it and
whenever it's lied I will have a link in
my description boxes I love you guys
