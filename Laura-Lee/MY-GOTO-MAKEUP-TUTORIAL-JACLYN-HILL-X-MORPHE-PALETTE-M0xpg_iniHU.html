video is going to be my go-to makeup
tutorial using the Jaclyn hill x morphe
palette so many you guys have asked me
to use this on my channel and I didn't
get around to using it whenever it first
launched but is relaunching this Tuesday
the 18th of July at 8 a.m. so hang tight
for that so I figure oh my gosh we're
probably going to get around to filming
with it on the second round of the
launch actually guys on Twitter what
kind of look you guys wanted to see and
my go-to makeup look or a colorful look
and you guys mostly commented both both
both both both so in this video I am
going to do my everyday makeup look give
you a visual zat and then I'm going to
add some color onto it to show you guys
how you can incorporate color and use
your colors inside cuz I know allow you
guys already have this palette so I hope
you guys are excited for the tutorial
you already know what we're about to do
here if you haven't already be sure and
we'll go ahead and jump right into the
video I brought you really up close and
personal to my face we're going to go
ahead and start by priming the skin I'm
going to be using the NYX shine killer
this is a great primer if you get a
little bit Oly out throughout the day
now it isn't like a lifesaver it's not
going to completely stop your skin from
getting breezy but I think it does add a
little bit of a helpful touch to
eliminate some of the dew eNOS I'm it
mattifies the skin also oh my gosh hello
break out these two bumps have been here
for almost two weeks and they won't go
away so I guess they're just not part of
my face now I also pick up them so maybe
that has something to do with it so now
I'm going to prep my skin I like just
hit it with one or two sprays of the
more present set top now we're ready to
rock and roll I'm gonna go ahead and
with my foundation you guys know I use
this oh shoot dirty but I use this all
the time this is in shade beige this is
the vanished foundation from hourglass I
like to use a good bit of it you don't
have to use as much of it that I used
I'm just trying to be a full coverage
girl today now I'm going to take my
favorite brush of all-time
this is the y6 brush from morphe it's so
incredibly soft it's a flat top kabuki
and this is what I use every day to
blend out my foundation it was so funny
I did a live session the other day and I
was like hey guys what brush am I going
to blend out my foundation with and
literally the whole comment section like
y 6y 6 y 6y 6 4 6 it was so cool like oh
well I'm going to blend out this
foundation hollering it's really easy to
blend out whether it is a you know
whatever you want to use to blend it out
again I prefer the brush mostly but it
blends out so easily next up for
concealer I'm gonna be using the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in shade
custard this is what am I trying to
concealers that I use all the time so
lately I haven't been using quite as
much product I've really been just
applying it under the eye and blending
it out in the triangular shape and
dragging it down I'm like not as much
product you guys are like dear God well
with a lot of product you can also take
your wise sticks and blend this out
these brushes are great for cream
products so it's kind of like a
two-in-one with this brush typically
I'll just go in and blend out my
concealer with it as well and whenever
I'm blending on my concealer I like to
go back and forth back and forth like
that to get in all the creases of the
eye and then I normally do my notice
with my finger now I normally will go
ahead and set that concealer pretty
quickly today I'm going to be using the
Too Faced Born This Way setting powder
I've really been enjoying this I did
like a first impressions on there stuff
which I can link down below and one more
more about it but the setting sounds
very nice it does remind me a little bit
as a cover-up X was really like to get
that under eye if you have dry skin you
don't have to add this much powder if
you addressee and I do still recommend
you setting it your makeup but I don't
you don't gotta use as much because it
might dry your skin out a little bit
more so while that's setting there what
I've been doing lately is I letting that
set there and go ahead and do my bronzer
so I like to bronze throughout here this
is my favorite bronzer brush is the M
105 brush it's just like the perfect
shape and
I'm going to be using the fantastic
bronzer from Marc Jacobs and it's
humongous so I'm going to swirl them
around and then tap that excess off I go
back and forth I don't know why I'm such
a lunatic with my powders I'm going to
carve out the cheekbone a little bit and
I'll even pull these little baby hairs
on bags and then I'll start to blend the
bulk of it in the cheek bone right there
and then I'll take what's left and just
don't you drag it up I'll start and
bring it around my temples and then I'll
do a little bit right here I do have I
shadow at my hairline just to let you
guys know I'm trying to cover up my gray
hairs in between dyes gosh my struggle
is real I just so many questions about
my gray hairs and let me just let you
know I started graying when I was 16 and
it never turned back
my hairs gets grayer and grayer every
single day I normally am between dyes
I'll just do the black eyeshadow but you
still see I'm peeking through a touch
the 8:54 brush I've recently fallen in
love with to sweep away my powder
whether it's like the under cheek area
or right in here because I find that the
bristles are so dense and thick in there
it grabs the powder and knocks it off so
nicely now for blush okay I got these
new blushes in it from makeup forever
but they're like sold individually are
they pretty so I think I'm going to use
I'm going to use this ma beer color kind
of doesn't look that love it on camera
this one is B 208 right here it's so
pretty and I'm going to use my Y one
blush blush brush Y one brush to apply
it right on to my chi-chi's oh these are
pigmented girl you better settle down as
added so much blush to that cheek and
add just as much to the other cheek so
I'm just going to turn the brush over
fab blush and once I turn it over to the
Queen side and kind of buff some of that
blush out for a highlight I'm going to
be using with my favorite summer
highlights is a summer snow cone by
Jeffery star and it looks really yellowy
in the packaging but it comes off like a
really soft frosted golden color on the
skin and I've really been enjoying this
guy this is my favorite highlight
this is the art 36 there is a hair well
this is the are 36 and I find that it
has kind of ratty bristles which will
grab the product nicely and as you can
see oh my
and I'll even touch there and my upper
lip can always go back and on some more
- that's real live if you feel I like to
add it to my nose but normally with my
finger now what else do you guys already
know I like to hit my face a little bit
setting spray to set all these powders
in and then pack them down and then
we'll work on the eyes and then I'll
just take a sponge and just press it
down you use a Beauty Blender or
whatever to do this but this sponge is
just really faster my skin is done now
we're going to go ahead and do the eyes
first I'm going to fill in my eyebrows
and I'll be right back plus my camera is
dying so we need a new battery oh here
is my palette now mine is a little bit
dirty I use her a lot okay
so just pretend that she's not also I
went ahead into my brows and then I also
put a little bit my Mac Paint Pot on my
eyelid first what I've been doing is
going in with these two top shades right
here and I'll just use my m57 3 it's a
fluffy blender brush gets them on like
that and then I'll go ahead and buff
that right into the crease of my
transition shade go ahead and put down
whatever primer you like best I always
stick with the Mac Paint Pot I love them
a lot so what I like to do whenever I'm
blending a nice shadow is I'll go ahead
and press the color into the actual
crease and then once most of the color
is press to the crease I'll take
whatever is left on my brush and start
to buff upward and that way you're not
getting too much color like all the way
out here you see how that's deeper that
way up here isn't quite as steep
now I'll switch a little bit of a
smaller blending brush I'm putting it up
here on my forehead because you can't
see that good right there
DCL is smaller and it's a little more
tapered at the end this is the r39 from
the rose gold collection now I like to
take it a little deeper and I'll just
mix these two shades together like that
one side of the brush and I'll flip the
brush over and I'll do the same thing
really
buff those colors right into the crease
now as most you guys know I always tell
you the deeper to color I go because I
kind of build up Browns typically in any
local head and buff out a few Browns
the deeper the color I go the lower I
keep the color so I won't start bringing
these darker Browns effects hi next I'm
going to go into our warm tome friend
right here and I'm just going to get a
little on the r39
same brush and just pop it right on in
there outer corner focusing most of the
color and then I'll go ahead and sweep
just whatever is left on the brush
really on the inner corner right there
but most of the color goes is going to
go in that outer corner for the fun part
I'm actually going to go ahead and go
into this cold color right here oh my
gosh I think this is my favorite color
in the whole entire palette if you know
me like I am a gold go-to girl gold gold
gold I love the color gold actually
typically wear more gold jewelry then
silver that's nothing to do with
anything I'm just letting you know that
when my favorite brushes to pack on
color is the m42 one it is a flat
synthetic brush but it's a little bit
shorter so it's great for shading and
really getting precise I'm going to
build on some color on the brush and I'm
going to hit it a few times with a
little bit of a mist and I have to wet
all my shimmers it's just like an
addiction that I have you don't have to
wet these eyeshadows they are so creamy
but um you don't have a fancy thing for
either to wet them you can wet your
brush with a little bit of water and
then grab the shimmery product and it
works the same I like to use mac's fix+
or the morphe preps and set what I like
to do is because this brush has like a
flat rounded tip I like to set it right
there with my natural crease is and
because the color is wet I can go ahead
and kind of carve out I hit my mic I go
ahead and carve out the crease
now we're going to do the same thing to
the other eyeball it's okay if you're
brown
get down on your lid because you're
shimmer from this palette is so
pigmented you can just layer it right on
top going back into the palette might
take this deep brown color right here
the same r39 brush and I'm just going to
get some on the tip and really just
lightly very light hand it leaks this
colors very deep and pigmented and I
want to have an explosion on my eye so I
just going to lightly buff some in the
outer corner in that outer crease and I
just have it like on the tip of the
brush not all over the brush now this is
my eyelid this is what I do lately I
haven't really been applying anything to
my brow bone eyes kind of and let them
naturally be lighter from the eyeshadow
primer but what I like to do now is to
tightline as well as add a little bit of
black liner on the upper waterline and
case I'm going to add lashes which once
you know I'm going to I'm going to take
this you a slim eyeliner in black and
I'm going to go ahead and tighten a
little bit
now it's time for lashes and then I'll
add a little bit of mascara for lashes
or I'm using some that I've worn before
these are my Amy by Lily lashes because
I'm going to take my M to ten bright
Amanda exist in the shade I'm going to
bust them on the lower lash line and I
always like to connect lower lash line
with the outer corner I'm going to pay
this e43 brush which is just a little
bit of a tighter brush for the waterline
grab that darkest shade my buff her
really close to the lower lashes I take
that issue a skinny liner and shade
black and just add it a lower waterline
now and then I'll pop on some mascara to
my lower lashes I'm going to add the do
or a pump and volume mascara to my upper
and lower lashes kind of connecting is
the real lashes to the salt flash is now
the glues dried down a little bit then
also of course to the lower lashes for
lips I'm going to take this curvy lip
liner by colour-pop and line my lips I'm
going to take darken suede lip ammo from
Jeffrey star I'm going to go ahead and
fill in this center of my lips and then
rub them together and lastly we can set
everything with deliver the more people
haven't set one up we are finished this
is my go-to look the look that I love
the look that I always wear they look
better I can't get enough of so have a
little gander and I guess I hope you
like this look now we're going to add a
little bit of this purple color in the
crease we're going to keep stay go I'm
going to use the endless 210 brush grab
some of the purple on the tip of the
brush and going to buff the purple rut
in the crease
we're going to take that purple on this
210 brush and just push it right into
the lashes the outer corner and then
take the tip of that brush and work it
in that crease up there actually going
to grab some of the blue - I'm going to
go in and add it right on in there so I
really want to get some colors that one
makes the purple and blue together and
just on that outer corner plus it in and
then make it connect I think just like
that easy you can incorporate color your
palate it's obviously easier to do this
look whatever you don't already have
your lashes on comment down below if you
like to colorful look better or just the
golden eye better thank you guys so much
for being here and watching and I will
see you all in the next city I just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
