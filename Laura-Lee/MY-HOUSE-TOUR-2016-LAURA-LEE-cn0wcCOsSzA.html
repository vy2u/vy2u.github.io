video is gonna be a little bit different
because we are gonna be doing a home
tour I'm gonna show you where I live my
life and where all the YouTube business
happens my home is about 90% done our
bedroom is not completely done but it's
almost there so I figured heck I am
tired of decorating this house we're
gonna share it with you guys I love my
home it's super modern it's a very chic
la pad I love everything about my home
so you're gonna hear me say that a lot
in this video so we're gonna jump right
ahead and get started be sure and
subscribe before you leave I love you
guys let me know if you guys want to see
more these kind of videos my life you
wouldn't know about me then comment down
below let's jump right in and get
started alright guys we're going to
start with the living room so here's my
living room I wanted to decorate it very
classy clean and keep it open because my
windows are the favorite part of this
room so I started decorating it with Z
Gallerie furniture because I'm addicted
to Z Gallerie you're going to see that
later on
I added some staple pieces and a couple
of pops color to the room but like I
said I wanted to keep it clean and
classy most of the decor I get from
Amazon or Z Gallerie and a couple of
things from TJ Maxx and home goods that
I could find that we're affordable and
then we want it to give the room a
little bit of a wooden texture with this
TV stand since the rest of the room was
so silver and mirrored and so I got
these leaves and pieces from TJ Maxx
with the actual wooden scene is from
overstock we got a great deal on it and
the room is so bright and lit
like absolutely beautiful it's my
favorite room in my home I adore it this
green plant is probably one of my
favorite plants probably one of my
favorite pieces in my home I got it at D
gallery and then we have the TV hung
with tacky cords hanging down that is a
problem for another day the chair and
blanket is from Z Gallerie I love the
classy touch that it gives the room and
I love the studs on the side that are
silver it really ties it together with
the rest of the room and this coffee
table and side table both match they are
from Z Gallerie the books below or just
magazines like Vogue I try to access
that this to cave it at times but we
both know I do not repo the plants from
Z gallery in the picture is of my niece
the couch pillows and pictures above are
from Z galleries as well as the swivel
East Side table over there and then the
lamb and flower is from TJ Maxx the
lamps actually broken on the bottom but
you can see that I don't know why I told
you
and in my rug is from living spaces I
highly recommend living spaces if you
want to rug for your home and this is my
living room this is my mini office you
see over here and my old home I had this
put in my beauty room and I felt trapped
my beauty room every time I wanted to
work we spend majority of our time at
our desktop I am literally sitting right
here right now just and visualize me and
Indian style in that chair
so I decorated the desk with a few
pieces like the Chanel books a faux
plant this glass thing from Target and
then on the other side I have a lamp
from Target as well some candles from
Urban Outfitters the desk is packed full
of notebooks sticky notes and a bunch of
junk that doesn't need to be in there
the chair is from living spaces and it
has this faux sheepskin blinky on top of
it or just piece on top of it from Crate
and Barrel and there is a wad of cat
hair under the desk that you do not see
right now
if you can tell our living room and
kitchen one big open room it's just a
very open bright home I let my cat sleep
on the counter because I don't care if
her asshole touches the counter because
we pay for our own counter so don't
judge me dont you judge me so anyways I
love the kitchen like I said it's a very
modern kitchen it's beautiful it's
bright the countertops are white which
actually doesn't bother me I got these
barstools was to look chic at my old
home and I just brought them over
because they stayed looking good in this
home and I'll have them linked down
below cuz I don't know where they're
from off the top of my head and then we
just have the cat food crap right there
Tyler has his little bar area this is a
way to keep him from putting alcohol on
top of my beautiful kitchen counters and
then we have like these gray textured
cabinets which are very pretty I added
these plates and monkey and leaf details
because I love greenery
that's just like a fake eating area we
do not eat off these and I got all that
from Z Gallerie the big plant in the
middle we got from Z Gallerie and the
plant inside of it from Z Gallerie but
would you actually put that together on
our own that was not a piece that we
bought all together I feel like we did a
good job I'm like patting myself on the
back right now those roses with the L on
it in the corner are from Z way and then
I have some greenery pops of greenery in
the back like t.j.maxx just super
affordable very fortunate that our home
has loads of cabinets I actually can't
even fill up all the cabinets with stuff
that I have so some of the cabinet's
aren't empty there's just lots of
storage space and then we just have the
oven a good old microwave I call those
my ugly people on top of the oven we got
my Anthropology and there is my greenery
that I got from TJ Maxx on a marble
little plaque I got some Sprinkles
Cupcakes from Smashbox
Thank You Smashbox
those were so good I am already and then
I want you guys see the back wall of our
kitchen it is so gorgeous and obsessed
with it sparkles and we have LED lights
that shine down to really make them
shine I adore it so then you'll see this
frosted glass door right here and is my
spare bathroom and I love this bathroom
because I love the Risen sink I think
it's so pretty
what's up ty he's helping out filming
today and then all they did is add a pop
of greenery in this room and you see the
UM the backsplash wall is so pretty to
me I adore it next we're going to share
with you our balcony which leaves right
outside the living room the cats love
this balcony and I created it pretty
much everything on this balcony is from
Amazon I love the city view you get our
home is very quiet you actually can't
hear cars from where we live and that
palm tree is live we get the most
beautiful sunsets you've ever seen every
afternoon living where we live and all
those pieces on the coffee table light
up so at night is really beautiful my
cats normally knock over that fake plant
and try to eat it so it's standing up
for the first time ever
but the patio furniture worked out great
because it's from Amazon and it's like
for balcony so it's a little bit smaller
balcony furniture so it doesn't over
crowd the balcony and then I just add
some pillows that are all from TJ Maxx
and Target and then the rug is great
it's a patio rug I got off Amazon is
very affordable so our floor pan to the
home is very modern there's lots of
hallways and I'm going to take you into
our master bathroom down this hallway we
put a large mirror which I'm going to
save some Ltd's in and I adore this
bathroom it's my second favorite part of
the home so it's very modern as you see
same white countertops the walls are so
pretty the showers pretty and my bathtub
is Bob calm
hashtag bathtub chat if you follow me on
snapchat you know what I'm talking about
I love the shower it's very wide the
bathtub goes very deep and then you have
all my little bat bombs and everything
on the side then we have two sinks and
low
as a cabinet space in the bathroom which
is amazing this tall cabinet you see
right here is packed full of unnecessary
skincare products those flowers are from
pixie beauty Thank You pixie they aren't
normally there but I figured I'd set
them in the bathroom for the video as
far as our bedroom it's not completely
done so I'm not going to show you every
piece of it but the back wall the bed
and pictures on the wall are done I'm
going to add a lot more to the bedroom
though so our bed is so pretty Patrick
Starr have helped us decorate this room
actually and I love the way it came out
this door opens right off our balcony so
it connects to the living room and it's
just so bright and well lit I have a
walk-in closet Tyler has this closet
right there to the right
the pillows and all are from like home
goes t.j.maxx and then the bedding is
just a white big fluffy duvet we
actually packed two duvets into one so
it gives like a hotel bed vibe super
cozy and then we have these tall mirrors
in the back and the tall lamps are from
Z Gallerie and again we have big open
windows in our bedroom that leads right
off the balcony it's such a great view
we got these little end tables from
overstock we get a great deal on them
overstock has good stuff and then that's
a picture from our wedding and then the
lamps are humongous and then the mirrors
are I can't remember the website I'll
have them post it on here the pictures
of picture frames above the bed are from
Target and then same thing on my side of
the bed you know lots of glass detail
lots of silver going on throughout the
house I haven't bought a dresser for my
room I'm going to redo so I'm not going
to show you that part of my room the
fuzzy rug is from TJ Maxx and then I
think I can't remember what this install
is from but I'll link in down below this
blanket is from z-a Lurie I think it
just gives it a pop of color and a
little bit of messiness to the
perfection of the bed patrick star like
i said was a huge help in designing our
bedroom so next up is my beauty room
this is where the magic happens where i
film all my videos as you guys are used
to seeing this right here as my
background
I have a discount code for that vanity
on my desk is from impressions vanity so
this is where I film all my makeup
tutorials and the drawers is packed full
of lip product and then I just have a
couple of cute little trinkets and
things to decorate the desk for my
background and over here I have also my
Alex 9 drawers where I store all of my
makeup it is the youtube starter kit the
Alex 9 drawers are so cliche but they
look nice in the room because they're
white they're quite dirty actually - but
these are packed to the top with makeup
and then I have more makeup on top and a
couple little trinkets and things like
that here's my poster for my 1 million
party I've got to get a frame for this
and hang it up I think it's so cute
thank you to face and then here's my
little stool that I sit on it's from TJ
Maxx it's really dirty so I put a
blanket on top of it and this is an
overview of my beauty room I love the
view off my Beauty room you get to see a
bit of the city and then on this lock
shelf I just decorated it with a couple
different trinkets my theme was clearly
white and pink I wanted to keep it very
girly because this is the beauty room so
I just have my horsey some fluff Oh
flowers not flow and I love all the
doors in the home if you can see there
their frosted glass I think they're so
pretty and modern and it's very chic and
clean looking and then here is my
spinning lipstick Tower and some perfume
and some more food flowers and then on
this wall I have some pictures hanging
my million plaques coming YouTube notify
me I'm super excited about that
that is my hundred thousand subscriber
mark plaque and then in this room it
comes with a full bathroom which is nice
I love this shower the texture in the
wall is very pretty it's mostly for
guests we don't really use this bathroom
I mean I use it a pee sometime that's
probably TMI but you know I mean and it
comes with like a chic clean sink
I got eat it up with all my necklaces
and chokers it's about it for my home
