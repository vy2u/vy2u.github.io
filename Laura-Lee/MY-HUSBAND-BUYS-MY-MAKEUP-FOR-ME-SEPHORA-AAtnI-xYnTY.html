everything that bought because I'm
pretty sure it's the right color shoes
that know her colors so he votes a I use
it even though it's not going to be my
color so despite what the face makeup
was so psychic
I just doesn't want to do it because he
wants her eye really pretty look so you

product anyways and you'll bear with me
in the video so you're gonna get it'll
help and then I'll show you my look I
create it when I'm done that's the block
hi Willie
Genesee first I'm going to go in with
the primer now this is my own versa so
any bolts and we're very familiar with
this on my channel it's just a little
facial primer is good for filling in the
pores
we're gonna show low sodium good enough
and now we're gonna go in with this
foundation I don't think I mean I think
it's going to be pretty dark but I don't
think it'll be I don't know I don't
think it'll be too bad we'll see I used
to my why six brush from Malta
oh my god this is like 80 shades to door
okay
think I was trying to give it the
benefit of a doubt for a second there
when I knew I knew the verdict that's
okay
this is a really thin watery foundation
this one is the just skin foundation I
think I look a mess like all in my
eyebrows okay I keep rubbing it in and
posted it'll get lighter but all these
gray hairs y'all it's not getting
lighter okay
okay let's do our eyebrows have the
Presley brow pencil I didn't switch this
out for my own because I use shade for
and I just wanted to do was check three
which is the shade he bought me we'll
see what that looks like
I'm glad I bought me precisely though
it's my favorite brows in school but we
work well okay don't hate it colors not
that bad so I look kind of pretty I
really did build up the color though
like I added a lot of shade three like
lots of stroke so we could darken it
just a little bit and I don't think it
looks bad all right ty you got a win
look at those brows alright next let's
go ahead and do some concealer I'm going
to be using my NARS and custard up
actually as you can quit with save and
enjoying this one a lot so this is
nothing new so they get an eye primer
I'm actually going to go ahead and use
this as my eye primer which is totally
fine anytime I don't have like a high
primer on deck I'll just use my
concealer it doesn't always work quite
as good but it gets the job done I'm
going to do some pretty good
highlighting to my face so that way it
will help in the foundation to lighten
up I'm going to take my g 39 brush from
morphe
and just I like that this one stiffled
because it's really soft on your under
eye but I'm we're going to blend this
eioped go ahead and add some to my
eyelid as Thomas you know with all the
highlight that has potentially lightened
up this is foundation what do you guys
think well the foundation is like it
looks a little better when I had and
carved out my eyebrows a little bit with
it to you okay
that is anyway too dark so I'm going to
take the cover of X medium and I'm going
to stablish around my face trying to
avoid the highlight area because we know
that that will be a mess I'll take my e3
brush to do so it actually you know it's
actually lightening the foundation
because the foundation was so dark I
feel like the setting powder is setting
it and it's kind of making it a lighter
white at the end of the tunnel now I'm
starting to see Taylor's vision where he
was going with this makeup look I'm
starting to see a vision so now we're
going to see if there's a shade to set
my under eyes try this peach shade it's
not the end of the world you know but
it's pretty I'll just rub my blender in
it but oh this is too dark too dark
oh I don't know what to do about setting
my under eye like that looks intense I'm
just gonna have to put it on there and
we're just going to look weird kind of
took away my highlight and I feel like I
look really peach right here okay
I'm gonna I'm going to keep it moving
with a positive attitude here now let's
go ahead and do a little contouring I'm
going to be look at this hoola Laura -
uh so this obviously is my own not the
one from Sephora I'm going to use a ya5
brush from morphe I really love this
little bronzer so I'm excited that you
picked this up for me I don't know much
more broad thing that I need but this is
a really nice brush to use for this -
it's like a medium powder brush so I
like this brush if you wanted to
tour or front just bronze of the skin I
think it's great for both and a bear
look how dirty already got this it's so
sad I'm gonna wipe it off on my pants
does anyone else wipe everything on
their pants I'm a lot it was going to
shade eight it is the peach and my
favorite blushes or peach blushes so I'm
like I'm going to take a y3 brush my
cheeks and all this is very warm and
peach already I'm not gonna lie yeah
there's like a gnarly do you see what I
was saying when I tell you it's too dark
for me okay okay so look I don't really
have a transition shade I told me to get
creative so I'm going to use one of
these has a transition shade I'm the
Glenwood this shade right here this is a
Wyatt 15 blender it's a really soft
little guy and I'm going to go ahead and
just pop it in the crease I'm gonna go
over this pretty brown Oh brown shade
right here
okay I think we are transitioned enough
and now we are going I'm going to take
912 from makeup forever all right here
we go with shimmery shades you're going
to get the most pigment out of using a
flat synthetic brush like the one I'm
doing now I'm just going to apply this
on the inner corner of my eye just
making sure not to take it all up in
here I'm just going to keep it a little
bit lower go in with a blue or shade and
do like the outer corner of the eye make
it look really cool blue one is ten
times more intense in the purple I've
got to say I'm going to go kind of light
hand it where they meet in the middle
and just like softly smudge them
together I'm going to take my little
East 17 brush and I'm going to blend up
the Cree even window that's it in part
with it - girls y'all want to color how
they're going to give it to you I'm
going to add this pretty light purple
color
I say it's pretty because it is pretty I
just like in general lavender is not one
of my colors that I love this is that
m57 floor brush I'm going to add this to
the inner corner and then take this
color I'm going to pop it like on up
into the crease to get a little high up
what I am thank you my so ty bought me
this purple liner and I definitely want
to use it kind of want to like blend it
on the lower lash line and smudge it out
I'm going to take this e pull d3 brush
from morphe it's got a really nice mudgy
edge for smudging out those Lana
kind of want to finish out this let's
make it in really cool so I'm going to
go back in with the first purple color
we used add it to that lower lash line
as well I'm also going to add a little
bit that purple liner to my upper lash
line and do a mental magnifying mirror
so I can see real good I'm going to try
to wing this look out by taking a little
bit of this liner on a eyeliner brush
like I just like scraping it off on here
that's really pretty so this liner it
just adds up it works really well as a
winged liner situation next up is lashes
I'm going to add these velour lashes by
the way these are in let's say fluff in
wispy alright guys here are the lashes
now I'm going to add some mascara who
bought me this Dior mascara that I've
never tried out before but come on
comics I don't try it out I'm going to
get my magnifying mirror again if you
guys don't mind and really get in there
we're going to go ahead and highlight
using this tarty Tarte palette I'm going
to put a lid on the shade right here
this am 510 brush from Malta
really pretty my favorite shade out of
this palette in case you're wondering
I'm actually going to take a little bit
of a strobe shade and highlight my brow
bone and now for lips I'm excited to try
out this Louboutin lip liner cheese
extra I'm going to line the whole entire
lip with it and I'm going to add a
little gloss on top ty seemed pretty
disappointed whenever he accidentally
got the lip gloss so we're really gonna
make this work
girl how does this lift up I don't know
how to do it I don't get it okay we'll
just use a I don't know how to like
scroll it up I know what you do yep you
turn it you keep turning it in the lid
and it sharpens it interesting and it
like clicks it up for you I guess that
color was called elf ten and now I'm
going to take the undress lip gloss
which I already have this which I'm just
going to use this one anyway because I
really like this color so I'm super
happy he went with a neutral lips since
our eyes are obviously the color here
and last certainly not least I'm going
to set everything with my all-nighter
