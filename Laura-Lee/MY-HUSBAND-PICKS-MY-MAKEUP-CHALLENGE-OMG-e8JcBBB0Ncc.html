the video he knows and then the thing
goes bye
she got first primer I'll help the recce
to the jurors so we're not just show you
I feel like like am I supposed to be
picking like a look and then I feel like
concealer concealer okay guys take the
makeup literally majority of the stuff
he picks I would have never ever picked
I rarely use he picked things like basic
what I'm looking at he picked things
based off packaging uh-huh
you literally you literally saw what was
cool magazine
that's exactly what I do except for
there is a color
in there I was like oh I haven't seen
her used this in a while that was
supposed to be the ban on Advent
gradually and somehow I ended up back in
the door it was in the drawer so this
free game the first thing he did pick I
like thank God is this dare to create
palette why don't you pick this honestly
because of how big it is I was like you
know what I'm not even gonna mess around
I said I'm just gonna give you the
biggest pan that you have in there he
picked a big one primer we have Victoria
Beckham I've never used this foundation
Elizabeth Arden flawless perfecting nude
I honestly don't know why I picked that
one okay did the jelly highlighter just
because it was jelly there it is
pick these huge I try to do individual
lashes but she wouldn't let me so I
picked the biggest set of lashes that
those are not cool
he picked guys he picked the car
changing but I'm so annoyed I hate this
okay pick Wilder I think we know why you
picked this go back gee you pegged
hydrating concealer because it was cool
yeah and then he picks some crazy Mac
let's rock lip product honestly just
found the crazies color I could go with
with the brow oh that's my face of
course honestly I just got lucky with
your shade why would you have stuff
that's not in shade in there dude
eyebrow colors change yeah you know you
never know he picked a purple liner
lipstick I always pick something purple
in every video I do couldn't resist
okay so now I'm gonna create the makeup
look you're gonna come back in and take
a look at judging see I give it like a
score Oh like a 1 out of 10 yeah okay
hey sista soul you forgot mascara crap
thank you
alrighty I went ahead and removed my
makeup that was on my face and I'm gonna
go ahead and start with this Victoria
Beckham primal primal primer and I'm
gonna apply this one face this makeup I
cannot guarantee a good look I have all
kinds of different makeup by the way to
go in with this Elizabeth Arden never
used it before I just have stuff in
there and to test out and like to do
different themed videos that
I haven't done before so it's really
interesting whenever he picks my makeup
for me because like I don't even know
what I'm gonna get this foundation
actually looks pretty good foundation
looks nice it's definitely not full
coverage but it's like going on really
smooth I think okay so the foundation
wasn't a flop thank goodness because
like the base to my face yo he
definitely just went for anything that
really cool packaging which I don't
blame him because I feel like that's me
whenever I'm shopping for makeup it's
just like oh my god that's such pretty
packaging I should buy it now like I
seen him do that I'm like no that's not
a good idea next I'm gonna go in with
the boying hydrating concealer from
Benefit he definitely picked this
because it looks like a big pencil
eraser I'm scared it's gonna be too
greasy and not cover enough but let's
see what happens I may have used this
before but it's literally been years on
years oh yeah honey well we'll set it
the only problem is for setting powder
he gave me the welder which is more it's
not like an under eye baking powder it's
like more so a we're gonna make this
look work okay I'm gonna be positive
first of all and I'm gonna turn this bus
around we're no good we're gonna make
this look work you can see my under eye
is like super shiny we're gonna work it
out okay so he picked Wow door which is
like a powder to kind of give your skin
a really soft velvet finish rather than
to set your makeup it didn't correct him
because I technically I'm not supposed
to in this video I'm gonna take a wild
I'm gonna set my makeup with it even
though that's not what this is for it is
setting the makeup beautifully down her
eyes don't look as bad as I thought they
would they are definitely like Creasy
but I honestly thought they look worse
telling how velvety this Wilder make
your skin look like a filter on it
next we're gonna apply it bronzer he
picked the YSL bronzing stone collector
item in shade Oh - it is stunning I'm
gonna take our 14 brush and just swivel
it around in the bronzer tap off the
excess and runs up my face
oh there's skin hanging out my lip oh
sorry lately my lips are peeling and I'm
so sorry you guys had to see that it's
not very pleasant you know what this
isn't looking bad I need to settle it
down between the positive train of life
though this bronzer is pretty it has a
gold reflective in it it has like this
little bit of a sheen which is really
beautiful it's kind of making my skin a
little more glowy see maybe I just need
to pick out all my makeup all the time
and that way I will use different
products that I normally wouldn't and I
just figure out you know that these
products are really great okay maybe
ties the creative one in this
relationship it's not me face is broken
out right here and he's really pissing
me off
so next I'm gonna take the brow pencil
benefit processing my brow and this is
shade number four this is the shade that
I always use so I was super excited that
he picked my shade because I have all
the shades in a drawer I have different
products like that that I don't use
because guys I may do a video and
brought products and I may need a swatch
all the shades stuff like that like I
have a lot of makeup for video use as I
was saying so there's really no idea
like he could've he could have picked
anything that's a good-looking eyebrow
okay I'm actually going to take a Y 23
brush and kind of tap into the center of
this concealer where there's pigment
rather than hydration and I'm gonna take
the pigment and carve out my brows and
use it as an eyeshadow primer would you
look at that creativity it's not really
there
but one mistake I made but we're still
gonna roll with it is I put the powder
on and forgot about the blush the
lipstick Queen blush which I've already
tested this out and I hated it so we're
gonna apply it anyways with a dampened
Beauty Blender it was actually supposed
to be in my bad binge or turning pink oh
not too bad
I just need to suck it up oh I'm trying
to open this
oh shoot I Pat the lid on the jelly
thing crooked oh it's stuck oh honey he
put it on there tight he's such a man he
just like threw the lid on crooked I
don't use this that often but I do love
it now we're gonna do our eye makeup he
gave me this palette with all these cool
colors in it I'm gonna take a tenth i35
brush I'm gonna tap into the first two
colors loop one into right here right
here and there's oh my gosh those are
gonna be my concealer shade let me try
again this is my transition shade
whenever you use a heavy weight
concealer on your eyes as your eye
primer which in this situation I have
much of a choice but it does make the
eyeshadow color kind of go on a little
bit darker because you're kind of
putting a matte on a wet substance so it
kind of tweaks the shade a little bit so
they're gonna do something good or tight
it's gonna be disappointing it's gonna
be like I'm gonna use this fuchsia
magenta shade this is such a bold shade
in the palette I'm going to apply it
with r39 brush which is a little bit of
a smaller tapered blender wow this color
is like Hello I'm gonna go ahead and
apply it from inner to
I'm gonna try to leave the center of my
eyelid plain with no shadow in it if
some shadow gets in there that's fine
with pigmented bold colors that are kind
of deep in color I like to kind of press
them on the eye first and then I'll kind
of go back and forth and blend them out
after that but I feel like if you just
start blending right away the color kind
of disperses everywhere and it can have
a lot of Fallout and get cray-cray
whereas you kind of push it into place
and then blend out the excess pigment
that's left I find that you have a
little bit more of a control I shouldn't
look I'm gonna grab this green gold
shade next I'm gonna apply this to my
eyelid I'm really focusing on keeping
the color in the center of the eyelid
because I'm trying to be like a
spotlight smokey eye but with bizarre
colors I guess kind of bizarre these
colors aren't like - out of the box
I'm gonna mix together this purply
purply purply shade in that maroon e
Brown right here kind of buff out that
edge right there and deepen up that
otterby and then I'm gonna press it
right in this inner corner as well just
gonna grab the black shade from the
palette and press it in the lash line up
here that way my lashes that are huge
and I have no idea what they're gonna
look like whoa and that way you can't
see the lash band as well my skin
through the lash band I picked one of my
favorite mascaras because he liked the
pump on it and I like it too these
lashes are called fluff and wispy from
velour all right absolutely loving these
lashes see time make me try out all
these new things girl these lashes are
pretty I'm gonna take a touch of the
jelly highlighter on m57
for brush I'm just gonna
quiet right here and just a touch on the
brow bone I'm gonna grab this shade
right here a buff it on the lower lash
line just enter the outer corner it
takes in that green gold color alright
and now we're gonna add this crazy lip
color that does not match our eyes oh
that's so bad last I'm gonna add this
purple liner from Lancome into my
waterline alright alright what do you
think let me think I'm getting a look at
you better myself oh really
looks good you know I wouldn't have
tried this makeup or ever put it
together and I mean I wouldn't use them
separately for sure maybe get creative
did I the lips I mean yeah I probably
wouldn't look but now with this look but
the lip looks cool and I think
everything looks super good that's it
for this video guys I think this was a
cool concept and I think I did a really
good job yeah so basically when you go
shopping
pick whatever has the best pack rightist
packaging and your makeup will turn out
great and that's just the moral of the
story so thank you guys for watching and
we'll see you all in the next video
