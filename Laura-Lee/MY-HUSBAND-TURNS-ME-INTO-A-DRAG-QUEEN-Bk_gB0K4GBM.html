what's up guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be with a
special guest we get pie in the hizzy
I'll stop - today we are gonna have my
husband turned me into a drag queen and
I'm really excited about that yes pretty
pumped about doing those brows I don't
even know like I don't know how you're
gonna do this but I've kind of showed
him pictures and like I'm well versed
cuz I watched a few videos so he loves
drag race to watch it and she's watching
yeah he'll totally watch it but we love
the art of drag we love drag queens we
love all of that like we love that art
so we thought what better fun way to
play with it and how my husband try to
do it's gonna be fun I watched a few
videos I watched a guy put glue in an
eyebrow I have like everything
everything I think you need to turn to
directly to have loads of product out
here form big lashes glues powders
glitters lip product for him to kind of
play with oh and you've never turned
yourself no I haven't I've wanted this
fame me and miss fame did a project
together but I asked her she'll come on
my channel and turn me dragon she said
yes so whenever miss him is in LA we're
gonna have to hook that up but until
then I guess out there call me mr. Fang
mr. Fang so let's go ahead and sing the
song let's warm this up woman he's
warming it up see you toriel know the
guy he was training I'm helping you
like you have a lot we're gonna be more
I have very few eyebrows and you need
you guys'll are has the biggest pet
peeve about other people touching her
face this is so satisfying and touching
her Oh making me itch and go crazy like
makes me nuts some people touch my face
with their hands the guy went against
the grain but I'm not gonna do that to
you
oh thank you because that just seems
like way too much for sparing these guys
are late so what am i doing I'm just
gonna hand you this though this is
concealer guys and I'm gonna go in with
this concealer if you've been using this
one a lot so I'm gonna go with that guy
I don't know why I've been using that
this is actually which colors yours and
you just tell me what's wrong
no babe you just go okay maybe this
remember we'll put foundation on top
okay like it doesn't even matter what
color this is
is that a lot this would be a lot easier
if you were like laying on the ground
like I could write like on a desk you
know how you write do people do makeup
laying down that would be so easy look
that's a lot stop moving
that one is not like that brow is not
gonna be looking good yeah get in there
yeah and we're done good bro okay so
what would you do no I think this kind
of needs to be black this is never gonna
be the color of my skin no matter how
powerful blending is okay so I guess
foundation is a nice step then I put
foundations actually yeah
I feel like this one cool option hey you
are the makeup artist just gonna do the
same thing go pretty far is this your
color yeah it's like it's tricky makeups
tricky like watching you do this and
like thinking about people who haven't
like experimented with all different
types of makeups and brands like it is
tricky like you just don't know like the
consistencies of different products I
feel like I should be putting this all
over you right yeah this is your
creation
oh just know this was my creation we'd
be using more glue on them eyebrows I
wouldn't get a lot of stuff into my
lashes cuz this is impossible to get
black whenever you put on false lashes
I'm just trying to give you tips because
then like it'll be like white crusty
lashes mixed in the flat horrible you
can clearly still see your eyebrows so I
would even like you can mix foundations
you know I mean you just do brows are
just still there
sparse this could be we're starting to
look pretty cakey here like cake you
don't just and natural yeah guys let's
not forget to drag it down chin you want
to go all the way to the chest
[Laughter]
elegance darker glory give me did you
took the sponge loaded with the white
color and then you blend it this way oh
no let me do it you can't be doing it
what it helps
anymore Beautyblender so basically I put
concealer all over your face you're
welcome we can't forget that bro hey
she's a full-coverage queen I like it
yes should I draw the brows now I feel
like because it's so crazy and wet like
brow part would slip off so what might
helps at some powder yeah I got powder
here cover Thanks hmm yeah get in there
get in there don't be bashful I'm in
here baby
how do you do makeup so fast I'm sorry
baby I don't do drag makeup every day I
know but you've been using all the same
product probably slightly you gotta do
what you gotta do sometimes yeah
literally gonna have two sets of
eyebrows if I draw some long right now
I like two eyebrows thank you next a BB
up we're gonna draw you on some brows
I'm gonna let you know that this route
on the other side is a little bit of a
bust
and I apologize for that good thank you
eyebrows I'm gonna give you some brow
products not I just watch the tutorial
that you filmed on how to do a good brow
brush different no I wanna thank you
damn it
that is a brow
I really need you a little different but
I like your artsy take on it it's a bit
of a thick brow what do you guys think
let's do my shadow I should see a shadow
that's fun add the full spectrum palette
we definitely want color colors and then
I have the palette 9 this is very draggy
cuz a lot of cut crease colors and nice
mattes in there let me get my present
I'm a makeup geek color so in case you
wanted you should I watch mr. famous
video oh no this is your like this is
yours just know it's a very um I'm on
guard cut crease this is your moment
this is my moment this is what's going
in with this random brush here

you better get dragged can I put this
start hard on you what are we watching
it on Thanks we must been watching it
really
so he went like yeah like that and then
he kind of made it go off the pit
yeah like up and out this is super tacky
oh yeah look at that crease girl she
better work
she better look worksheet but is cut
okay hold that brush disturbs me it's
like it's like this literally looks like
I'm putting nothing on your eyes maybe
we can move to deeper color we could
eventually so here we're gonna go with a
look like a bib they did the rainbow I
thought you were saying it that was the
name of the colors so we're gonna get
these are make it forever and they're
gonna cigarette yeah quit looking at
yourself I know it's beautiful
I know real dark on the outside and fade
