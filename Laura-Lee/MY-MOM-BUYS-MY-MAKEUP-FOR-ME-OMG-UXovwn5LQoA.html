Snapdragon blush fake awake this is

you get something funny you don't use
those mm-hmm so I had to water for
Lauren
I sure did no one say what you look like
now well I'm gonna do my makeup and then
you're gonna come back and see what I
did
peace out you hate that alright this is
the part of the video where I glam we
forgot to get a facial primer let's skip
facial primer today and we're gonna go
in with the cover FX power play
foundation in the shade g40 this little
Crayola card has been quite handy I've
been using it lately to instead of
putting my foundation on my hand so I'm
gonna put it on my handy-dandy yi6 video
wait why is this brush you guys already
know you can use my code and let's see
she picked up chené g4t pepper facts had
about 10 million shades to pick from and
I think she tested almost every single
shade um did not play games so I'm gonna
pack this on now I tried this foundation
before on my channel and I did really
like it why is my face breaking out
lately I'm just packing this in and I
really like the color she picked out yes
mom she did such a good job she must
know me well okay we're gonna move on to
concealer and she picked out the Laura
Mercier flawless fusion concealer now I
just want to say that you guys have not
seen she picked out the shade to see by
the way but if you guys have not seen
the video where I glam my mom or I use
my mom's makeup definitely check that
out if you want to get to know all anime
better than what you already do know her
I get a lot of redness in my t-zone area
right here and I always have it gets
very red like that so I really like to
conceal that area sometimes I like to
use a damp and beauty blender to blend
oh there's a but today I'm gonna use my
why six brush as well because it works
well as any cream product can be blended
out with it really it's a kabuki so you
know girl it likes to get all miss
concealer is nice I really liked it
mom is so funny like products that she
doesn't really recognize her brand she's
just like no and she only went for
brands that she really recognized you
know I tried to like be late what about
this brand and she would kind of look
and she would just like keep wondering
I'm like mmm so I know Orban decay so
I'll get some urban decay the only brand
that she did venture out on that she'd
never heard of was pretty vulgar really
proud of her she loved the packaging and
the birds it really like caught her I
said that was exciting for her contour
she picked up the urban decay
shape-shifter palette I think urban
decay is one of my mom's favorite brands
ever and if I let her she would just
pick out a full face at Urban II can't
make up for me by the way my morphe
brush says set is back in stock if you
did not know that so we are back in
stock I don't even think my mom knew it
had a cream side to it because it's okay
so I'm gonna use for the first time I
think I'm using the powder to this set
my concealer I'm using a white 11 brush
because it's got that point and it's
just perfect to pack on the powder pack
on powder pack so I have set the
concealer and foundation it looks so
good good job mumsy pick now I'm gonna
go in with my handy-dandy r14 brush and
I'm just gonna actually grab a little
bit of both color you get like a good
bit of fallout with this palette but at
the same time it's like really pigmented
oh my gosh so I didn't I guess I like
underestimated how pigmented it is we're
gonna be blending this down to our
elbows honey I don't think I put enough
powder on top of my foundation so now
here we are with a lot on my face my mom
is gonna be disappointed I'm going to
take an hour 38 brush and take a little
bit that cool tone
and I'm just gonna contour and snatch
this wig off of my nose honey look how
printed it is girl you it's like the
lightest hand you've ever used in your
life is what you have to use with this
palette however I gotta say like I do
like the palette you just have to get
used to using it and with a light hand
it looks like airplane
racetrack is on my nose I'm going to
take a fluffy brush with a little bit
more the setting powder and just snatch
the edges a little bit more
she picked snapdragon from Becca
cosmetics it's gonna put some on my e4
brush and this blush color is really
pretty so I am digging it she did such a
good job with the products she spent a
long time in there I mean I was with her
but she was just like living her best
life her brows this is where all of our
trick she picked up the guru brow pencil
which I love but she picked out the
shade number two but I have to use it
because that is part of the challenge in
the video but I'm really excited and
emotional about brows are gonna turn out
first I'm going to spoolie my brows up
as I normally do by the way is anyone
digging this clumps of lash glue that I
just can't get off on my freaking face
it looks like if I go over the same spot
a good amount of times it really builds
up colors so we might be in luck here
we're gonna have to build up like lots
of color like boom I'm gonna have to
unload about half of this brow pencil on
my face
I'm really happy she went with a benefit
brow pencil though because Sephora has
so many options for like brow products
so I was getting a little nervous so she
hooked me though it looks so good
you ever draw on one brow and you're
like yes I'm ready to slay take over the
world
and call everybody yeah I think you do
your other eye and you're all of a
sudden light that happens to me it does
weird it doesn't I don't realize it's
happened to me sometimes until after I
take a picture myself and I'm like wow
you you
and try on that other bra there did you
my mom is in neutral I should have
palette girl so she loves new to be 2d
and I know whenever she saw this natural
palette from pretty vulgar she just fell
in love with it she originally had the
mini Urban Decay heat which I was pretty
excited to use because I really haven't
gotten to use that one yet alright brows
are on sister sue now we're gonna move
on to eyeshadow so as we showed you
should picked out the earlybird I
shoulda palette from it's like very
muggy very pretty very pretty we are
going to take a lovely morphe r39 brush
and i'm gonna go in with the shade right
here called ride really rise it's just
such a light neutral color that it it's
just gonna um you know soften up this
concealer I'm gonna take it our 39 brush
and I forgot to put on a highlighter
I know sinful I know this brilliant
strobe light from hourglass and I find
that the hourglass highlights are like
somewhat subtle but they blend into the
skin pretty effortlessly so I do love
that about them until you put on a half
gallon amount of it and then there's
just like a lot of hot like she
is highlighted hunty so I went ahead and
add it rise now I'm gonna go down and
add a victory right here I'm gonna use
it the same brush and I'm just gonna
blend victory right up in this upper
crease and I'm also just gonna start
putting it in the outer corner and I
really want to snatch it on out just
snatch it honey will snatch that wig I
like to take just a little bit of
victory and pull it forward next I'm
gonna take it come on take a time in
detail brush my mama's rubbing off on me
this happen into a veil which is just
pretty it's like has a reddish undertone
to it brown shade and I'm just gonna
build up and deepen that outer corner
right there and I also like to pull a
little bit forward
I love pretty vulgar eyeshadows I think
they're so soft and creamy and have a
really great quality to this do a chrome
chip and I'm not flicking you off right
here it's like this pinky gold is so
pretty I really want to know my take a
little bit Brown shades go ahead smoke
out this lower lash line baby I'm going
to spritz my brush with a little bit of
a setting spray and I'm gonna put chip
all over my eyelid I'm actually gonna
use this coverfx
eliminating spray she also picked out
this single eyeshadow from makeup
forever it is in 807 that is the color
so I just feel like I have to
incorporate it plus it's a really pretty
like marine deep red color hopefully
this will not go to all up in here I
don't know I don't know what I'm doing I
just like this color I'm kind of
thinking what the hell did I just do and
I'm kind of thinking yeah no I hate it
okay great now I have to do it to this
side like I have to so I'm gonna take a
little bit of the brown and just smudge
it with the pencil side of the brush
along the lash line that way when we put
on these big pretty lashes she got me go
that way it looks good I'm really glad
she picked out this mascara because it
is a little warm out a peach
my lashes are kotas so now I'm gonna go
ahead and add these wispy lashes from
velour is nice to film with other people
because I get so sick of looking at
myself all the time especially when I
ended my videos I'm talkin but I
appreciate you guys watching you know
just like a lot of me that I see I'm
gonna take some fake away from tard and
pop this into my waterline girl someone
needs to fake me away because I am
