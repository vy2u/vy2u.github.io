these it's amazing and also there's a
brush in here that I've been using on
the low-low and haven't really let you

notifications

you let's go ahead and jump right into
the video well
all right I've been waiting forever to
talk about this with you guys oh so and
I just want to let you guys know this is
separate from my larlie Los Angeles
launched separate separate that is
happening this month that video will be
up very soon on what I'm launching but
let me just let you know that this will
be a great addition to what I am
launching this launch first that will
launch later on this month but soon I'll
have a launch day if I don't have a
launch date for what I'm watching for
larlie Los Angeles my own brand I'll put
it on the screen if I have that day if I
don't have it yet it won't be on the
screen girl no hang on a little bit
longer so this again is a side from the
Laura Lee Los Angeles launch so just so
there's no confusion there let me just
start by saying that you can get this
right now it is for nine that is when
this launches this brush kit is for sale
I will have a link right down below
morphe brushes calm my favorites plus
plus let me talk about the price real
quick so this is 11 piece brush set plus
the bag that they come in so it's your
little travel bag or to keep your all
your brushes in if you bought all this
separately it would be 81 dollars but I
wanted to keep this really affordable
you guys ask me all the time what is an
affordable brush how can I get a full
face and makeup brush just affordably so
I was like guys my goal with this whole
kit is to keep the price low like I just
I just want the price to be low I don't
want to add a bunch of unnecessary
brushes that you're not gonna be using
every day I want to make a core brush
kit that people can use every single
brush everyday and they won't be wasting
their money but it's not too big or it's
not too small so we get the price down
to 54 dollars but that's not it
also you can get 15% off this collection

again you can get 50% off of it $54 plus
15% off originally an $81 this is
hell of a deal and I am so excited about
it so now I think it's time that we dive
into the brushes what's in the bag and
how I use them so I like to just slide
this off and that is my signature on the
front I sound real purty for you guys so
I like this brush bag too because it's
so soft and easy to travel with but I
like it because most of us already have
a couple makeup brushes and I didn't
want a bag where the brushes would be so
tight in here I wanted a little bit of
space so if you're traveling here are
the brushes that come in the kit but you
could also pop in a couple of your
brushes that you already own so there's
some space for some more brushes to go
in here has a really beautiful silky
nude or pink silky satiny finish on the
inside and then the outside is a pretty
nude color these are like my favorite
color so I picked the color of the bag
and then here comes the good stuff so I
think our best place to start here in
this video is a face brushes those are
normally my most exciting to talk about
to me and that's not what makes me most
excited so I think we know what brush
I'm gonna bring up first and if this
brush wasn't in this kit then I don't
need a brush kit it is the y6 brush from
morphe I've been using this for such a
long time for my foundation is a flat
top kabuki brush is wildly soft and just
the right amount of dizziness to
flawlessly blend out your foundation and
it also leaves your foundation with this
beautiful like airbrushed finish so soft
no brush streaks I like to stipple out
my foundation with this brush and then I
like to go in and taptaptaptaptaptap
stipple and then go in and kind of swap
it around to get that airbrush like
finish on the face and I make it comes
out flawless also something I really
love about this brush I find that the
bristles don't really absorb a lot of
your foundation I hate one foundation
brush should just suck up all your
foundation foundation is expensive y'all
and I'm not Charlie my foundation brush
have all the glory here it is for my
face so I really like this about this
brush now as you guys know I normally
have like ten of these lying around
because foundation brushes I tend to
like to wash them the most but bacteria
your face spreading germs around so I
normally have a bunch of these lying
around but you will get one in the kit
this is from the gilded collection this
is an amazing brush and it's great with
any cream product honestly because it
has that blunt edge you can definitely
blend out a cream contour with it you
guys have seen me a million time going
out concealer with it but just but just
hang on because you ain't gonna be
blending out concealer with it no more
those days are over honey
okay really excited because this is the
brush I was talking about the you guys
haven't seen yet that I kind of create
it with morphe and it I just really
needed to exist so we made it exist so
this is the brand-new this is the m5
three six brush it is also a mini kabuki
brush it is a cream product brush and it
is a beautiful brush so it has this dome
shaped tapered top to it and it is a
very soft kabuki again it just has like
that perfect amount of dances to it and
what I love to use this for is to blend
out my under-eye concealer with it and
my concealer all over my face with it it
has that dome shape at the top so it
just fits like a glove into your under
eye and it's so soft and gentle so it's
not gonna be pulling or tugging on your
under-eye I love this for the under eye
but I have to be careful cuz I'll pull
with it so this one you can really fit
in there and you won't have to pull as
much you can really get that soft stroke
really gentle on your under eye you
definitely need this brush in your life
and it also works well cuz it fits for
the chin the forehead and if you want to
again you could blend out the cream
contour product because it has that
small tip on it your really buff out
your cream product really beautifully
with this such a great brush to have in
your collection
and again its new and special okay so
this brush you can use for quite a
number of things and any of these
brushes like I'm trying to explain to
you you don't have to use them for just
one thing but this brush right here is
the white 11 is from the gilded
collection again you guys have seen me
use this boot qoodles of time now this
one and this one are quite different
they both have the really soft bristles
but the white 11 has a longer bristles
and they're way less dense so this one's
gonna be more dense over here and these
are like super flimsy really great to
hold powder product rather than cream
product I find that these are just too
not dense if that makes sense and they
fling cream product around so this brush
is great for powder and again because it
has that dome
a tapered top to it you can press and
bake or just set your makeup so well
with that powder on the under eye with
it you can also because it has like a
really nice little tip you can also
carve out the cheekbones adding some
powder right there and just sprinkle
powder all around the face I really love
this brush for powder products because
of its density is not that it and I also
like to use it for a powder contour but
I asked a hover brush in here for powder
contour and I think you guys are gonna
know which one it is
that is the AR 14 this one is from the
rose gold collection so this one has the
pretty rose gold top to it in a matte
black finish and the writing in it on it
is in rose gold so this is the perfect
sized brush for contour so it has a
rounded top and the bristles are a
little bit more raspy this one's brand
spring kit spanking-new so let me pull
out my dirty one so if you can see my
dirty one is a little more fluffed out
and that's how I like the brush so
normally whenever I get a brush kit
because in manufacturing they make the
brushes so you want to give them a good
wash before you start pushing them into
your skin so I like to go ahead and wash
them and you'll get this ruffled up
really nice brush ready to rock and roll
so when you get this I recommend just
give it a little gentle wash and you'll
be ready to rock and roll and it kind of
fluffs it out a little bit more but I'm
telling you it just fits so perfectly
right there in the contour area you can
just buff out for days bring it around
the temple area hit it and I'll even get
crazy and pinch it because this brush
just not that dense so it's really great
with powder product and pinch it and hit
the nose for the contour under the chin
and girl I hit the jaw line it's just a
perfect size brush for the bronzer
without spewing the bronzer everywhere
but you get enough bronzer on the brush
so it's absolutely perfect must-have
need in your life contour brush next is
for blush now this is a brush from the
elite collection that's a super fancy
collection at morphe this is the e4
angled brush if you don't like using
brushes like the r44 contour this is
also a beautiful contour brush but what
I personally like to use it for because
that's that nice angle to it is
to add blush I kind of got out of
wearing blush and now I'm kind of like
way back into wearing blush I don't know
I on an off hit but you can use this
brush for another number of powder
reasons it is from the elite collection
so it is extremely soft like it feels
like baby's bottom butter okay but I
always apply blush to this and it just
swishes back and forth so beautifully I
so gracefully and just spreads out the
blush just so evenly just like on the
face so this is an amazing brush for
contour bronzer or blush another one new
all these are my favorites but this
brush like I can't do my makeup without
this is the r36 again it's from the rose
gold collection so you get the really
pretty rose gold top to it and then the
matte black finish
so this brush is used for a highlighter
and I know you may be saying okay so
what about the fan brush for highlighter
I personally find that brushes like this
distribute the product in a more precise
area versus a fan brush I feel like
starts flinging the product the
highlighter everywhere like all the way
into my hair all the way down to this
area where you don't want highlighter
but this I can be way more precise and
it's amazing because I can just hit the
tip of my nose and the Cubist bow and
like around my forehead with it and
highlighter is not just exploding
everywhere because you got to be careful
you're putting highlighter we have pores
we don't want to magnify certain areas
and this brush is perfect to help you do
that without exploding makeup everywhere
so this is a great brush it has those
raspy bristles so it picks up a lot of
product so it's gonna pick up a lot of
your highlighter and again this is a
brand-spanking-new fresh one the dirty
one is a little bit more spread out so
give it a little wash it'll be a little
more fluffy everything baby now we're
gonna move on to our eyes shadow brushes
and go you have it's a cat hair on me
girl you have seen me use these eye
shadow brushes Dan and day out on
YouTube and now it's in a kit for you
okay these eye shadow brushes I'm gonna
explain to you why you need them okay
the first one is the m57 three brush
this one is a fluffy blender
in this one is clean and this is a dirty
one let me show you the difference the
dirty ones is a little bit more fluffy
so I like to start every single makeup
look with this brush I like to swish it
all over my eyelid this is a little bit
bigger of a blender so it is amazing if
you have a larger eyelid to blend out a
transition shade i've around a medium
eyelid but i still like to use it
because i typically will go in with my
looks with a bone shade and just blend
it or even the transition and blend it
all over not as precise with this brush
but if you have a large eyelid that's
gonna be amazing for you but if you have
a smaller eyelid this is also still
great to use to soften up your eyeshadow
primer to blend the transition shade
when you're not being as precise you
isn't getting in there and getting the
job done this is a great great must-have
blender so the brush that i use
basically to create every single makeup
look that do is the r39 this is again
the rose gold collection you get the
rose gold top with a matte bottom so
this is a little bit of a smaller medium
sized blender it's great from large to
medium to even small eyelids it is
tapered at the top and it's kind of flat
so it pops right into that crease just
perfectly so you're not gonna have color
exploding everywhere whenever you use
this brush you're gonna get it more
precise but it has those nice recipe
bristles where it picks up a lot of
color but it grabs the color and moves
the color so you're able to blend out
and move the eyeshadow back and forth
back and forth it is actually blending
the shade this brush if I had to pick
one brush to do my hones hair I would
look with it would be the r39 from
morphe it is an absolute must-have brush
I have like 50 of these and they're all
filthy that's why the only one I'm
showing you is a dirty one have any
clean ones because I use it every single
day no matter what even if I'm putting
one color on edge grab my r39 and I go
for it so this is an amazing brush and
of course it's in my kit so now you
might be asking me what about the eye
lid what about shimmer shades with our
cut crease what about the brow bone go I
got you so this is the m42 one brush it
is a mini concealer brush so you can use
it to spot conceal if you want to again
these brush multiple uses but what I
like to use it for
- is a synthetic brush by the way but I
like to pack on cream color shimmer
colors you can pick up your shimmer and
dampen the brush any type of color
you're packing on and enhancing color
you want to use this brush it also has
this nice rounded tip to it so it is
literally a perfect brush for a cut
crease to add the cream product and to
cut the crease with it also has that
nice rounded tip so it fits right under
the brow bone and it applies brow bone
color a little bit of highlight your
brow bone perfectly and again is
technically for spot concealing or mini
concealer brush so you can use it to
spot conceal multiple uses this brush
will stay dirty in your collection I
promise you you'll use it so much it's
amazing next up we have the pencil brush
which is just mandatory for detail work
now if you want to add a little bit of
color by the way this is the e36 I'm
getting ahead of myself I'm so excited
this is the e36 brush is from the elite
collection so it is so soft now the
reason I like the pencil brush from the
elite collection morphe has a lot of
pencil brushes but this special one is
the one that I like because pencil
brushes are small and the bristles are
short so whenever it's not the elite
collection the bristles aren't this soft
they get a little bit pokey and they can
kind of hurt your eye so with the elite
collection the brushes aren't as raspy
they're more soft so this one won't hurt
your eye that's just a tip with me in
pencil brushes so this is my go to so I
like to do little work in the crease
with this I always like to apply in our
corner color with this I like to blend
out the lower lash line like this any
smaller detail work you'll want to use
this brush for and last but certainly
not least is the eyeliner brush girl
when in doubt you guys know I'll be
winging it out so I have a liner brush
this is the M 250 - one liner brush so
basically it's just a skinny little
liner brush with a very precise tip and
it is perfect for winged liner it has a
little bit of flexibility to it so you
can flick it and get that wing really
easily it is an amazing liner brush and
it's my absolute favorite must-have so
that is the collection
