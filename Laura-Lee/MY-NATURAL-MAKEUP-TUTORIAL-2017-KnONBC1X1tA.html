skirt stream on Instagram and issues not
loading so yes I just will so my video
then hey guys welcome to my channel you
are on the la relieves channel I am de
Lara Lee that was a weird intro but
we're going to roll with it
today's video is going to be a very
natural everyday makeup
Tweel it is very soft on the eyes but
yeah pretty and then softer face makeup
but it has nice little coverage so yeah
in a little bit of us obsessed world
mm-hmm also I partnered with Clinique on
this video I'm going to be using their
beyond perfecting foundation plus the
home sealer and letting you know a
little more information about this as I
use it during the titute little toot
toot this isn't a newer product for me
I've used it several times I love it you
know another great thing about it is is
27 bucks so not too bad in pricing and
it comes in 28th so you can go to your
clinic counter to get matched to your
perfect shade of the foundation or you
can get a free sample of a week's worth
of the foundation so you can test it out
so you like it before purchasing it but
it is long wearing foundation and I
really enjoy it so I'm happy to use it
in this tutorial and thanks clinic for
working with me awesome if you haven't
subscribed to my channel you might want
to do so because I'm giving away two
MacBook Airs mark all you have to do to
subscribe to this channel when one into
when the other subscribe to my vlog
channel la liya vlogs and that's all you
got to do it is March the 15th
I have jibber jabber enough you guys
have heard a lot of so we'll jump right
into the video and go ahead and get
started and by the way I don't do my
brows in this video I'm gonna have an
updated brow routine coming very soon so
just hang tight with me it's coming I
promise you okay let's get started to
start this little toot toot I'm going to
go in with the pixie h2o skin drink as
some moisture from us stand clear little
Jill situation next I'm going to go in
with this Tarte primer and I'm just
going to add this two areas where my
pores are a little bit much of a massage
should only in so this is
a smoothing primer and it's really great
for the Buller effect and like the
smoothing of the enlarged pores which I
deal with a little bit right here next
I'm going to go ahead and add some
foundation I'm going to take the
Clinique beyond perfection this is a
foundation plus concealer so I'm going
to use it hello so I may use it as a
foundation plus a concealer and it has
this doe foot applicator on it which
helps you control the amount of product
and where you're placing it you can put
this part all over your face and use it
like a foundation or you can put it in
specific areas and use it like a
concealer whatever teach your horn this
is a school coverage foundation so I
like it for everyday use because it
doesn't feel too heavy but it is still
full coverage and I like this
accomodation doesn't dry too quickly
that way it gives you the time to like
blend it all out I hate with foundations
like stick down to my face right when I
put them on and I don't even have time
to like fully blend them out so one
thing about this foundation the
foundation color may appear a little bit
darker once ever you applied it but once
it's dried and then will melt into your
shade so I like to use a shade like a
wee bit darker than my skin tone I'm
actually going to use a little bit more
this I'm going to use it kind of like a
concealer too because it's a concealer
plus foundation I'm going to blend all
this out with my wife's Express from
office now I missed everything I'm just
going to use this Rimmel stay matte
powder
there's our seven brush from morphe and
i'm just going to kind of set this
makeup set it and forget it honey now
that my face is set I'm going to go in
with a little bit of my NYX Barone's
about here just to bronze like salt we
need cream contouring and doing all that
mess today we're teaching it simple just
going to add a little bronzer bronzer
the skin more so than really contouring
the skin now if you like to contour for
your everyday makeup that's totally cool
you know do you do whatever you want to
do with your makeup I'm just showing you
like a simple way to get the job done
make it look pretty good a - I was
sitting on a pin a whole time and take a
more py9 brush and just blend this color
rattle
round now that we're all - Bronto and
girl we are bronzed up I think a little
bit my belani Rose blush before we jump
into the eyes mm-hmm
come on rosy cheeks pun intended girl
you know I got a highlight too so I'm
going to go in with the Illuminati it
from artistic couture these are some my
favorite highlighter hmm I like the UH
the mac fix+ the damp in the skin and
that way it doesn't look so like powdery
and dry I'll even take like a Beauty
Blender and like dab it to like press
down the powder especially oh hi light
oh wait every thing looks nice and melt
it down and now we're gonna work on my
eyes okay you're like fine so for the
eyes I think the morphe 35o is a great
everyday eyeshadow palette it's got
shimmers it's got mattes and they're
pretty much all in the neutral family
and yeah it even has like some Mavi cool
tome friends in here if you're not into
the warm toned family over here so you
really get the best of both worlds plus
them what I normally like to do is first
go in with it to just any and neutral
cream color like this one right here
what this does is it sets the primer I
have a Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre down
already and I use that as an eyeshadow
primer and a base for my lid and is
worked for me for like five or six years
so girl is just what I use you know fine
next I'll move it on over to like a
transition shade such as this pan color
right here and I just like to blend this
into the crease by going back and forth
this is an e 35 brush from Sigma market
oh this is a very light transition chain
so that is a nice neutral base in a nice
transition shade and now we'll go in
with just a weak there the deeper color
I'm going to take this a little bit of a
deeper brown color right here I actually
just go ahead and mix these two and I'm
going to focus that in the crease I'm
also going to kind of buff it in that
out
corner this is a white 18 brush from
morphe this is part of the gilded
collection I've set in 9 million videos
that I love that gilded collection so
you know I'll be working these brushes
to dip now I'm going to grab even a
little bit of a deeper brown shade with
the same brush and I'm just going to
work that in the outer corner right
there next time I pick these shimmery
shades and you already know they're
going on the eyelid then going back in
with a clean blender I'm just going to
soften up the edge right there this is a
why 15 brush now that's a pretty neutral
Mille I might say myself
you can add some winged liner if you
want I'm going to do it I haven't done
it in a minute so I'm going to go in
with my NYC liquid liner or what's left
of it because I know this is like being
discontinued in the United States which
is rude or whatever I'm just going to
wing it out
now I'm going to grab a little business
bronzer or any of these darker brown
shades or medium brown shades let's just
say and just blend out my lower lash
line so keeping it kind of close to the
lashes now I'm going to take a little
bit of the fake
awake by Tarte this is their nude liner
and stab myself in the eye with it I'm
going up still in the waterline because
it makes the eyes look so awake and open
and fresh and I'm going to add a little
bit of the bigshot mascara from
Maybelline since we're doing a super a
neutral Nelly's will coming to going
with my lip pencil and stripped down my
Mac which is a super neutral Meli color
and I'm gonna line my love then I'm
going to go in with a version by morphe
you just put that right on in the center
see what I did there Tommy and yeah
that's the look you know actually I'm
going to pop a little bit of highlighter
in my inner corner right there okay guys
that's it for this video I hope you guys
