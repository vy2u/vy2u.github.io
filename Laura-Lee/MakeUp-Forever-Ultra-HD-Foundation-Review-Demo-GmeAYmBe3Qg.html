have on no foundation or facial makeup
right now because I just got the new
makeup forever Ultra HD foundation in
the mill about um I don't know like two
minutes ago and I was deciding what
video should i film today and I've been
wanting to review this and it just shows
up on my doorstep
that's pretty amazing I haven't tried it
out yet I can't wait to see my thoughts
on it I never got to try the original HD
foundation now this isn't the original
one this is their new Ultra HD so it is
a little bit different and I'm going to
be doing like a first impression so I'm
going to kind of wear it for a little
bit today and see how it wears and let
you guys know my thoughts on it I'm so
excited about it and I like winged it it
was just like picking out my shade
online actually went with shade 140 why
305 I don't know if I'm saying that
right I'll put my show you down below
and it looks like it's gonna be the
perfect shade so you guys want to know
more about this foundation and want to
know my thoughts on it well then just
ski and watch it the first thing I'm
going to do before I apply any
foundation which is my normal routine
apply a primer I want to always do my
normal okay I make sure I'm recording I
want to always do my normal makeup
routine when I'm applying foundation
that way I really know how it's going to
wear today I'm going to be using these
step 1 skin equalizer primer by Makeup
Forever and the ules this one's just
white and it kind of looks just like a
lotion or something like that I'm just
going to apply this to my normal areas
so it feels really good and soft it
feels like a gel moisturizer I don't
know my face was hot oh we enjoyed the
foundation now well that's on line to do
two pumps of the foundation I'm going to
apply it to my face and then I'm going
to read its claims and what is supposed
to do for you we got oh we got to get it
going
so that was one and a half really big
pumps fills it looks very liquidy but
once you rub it it feels kind of thick
and creamy so I'm just going to apply it
to the center of my face pretty much
like I always do and then we're gonna
blend it out I'll blend out one half of
my face with my Beauty Blender doebelin
delvia
half my face with my FA a kabuki from
Sigma I'm just going to start with the
Beautyblender side I always like to
start on the center of the face and work
my way outward with minimal foundation
and then you can just build up the
foundation that way you don't end up
starting out with cake face you can
always add more it's going to be a
little bit more difficult to take away
Foundation gosh like this color is
matching my face absolutely perfect it
does come in 40 different shades makeup
forever is like the shade gods and
foundation because they always have a
crazy amount of shades and they do
yellow tones and pink tones and they
even do really dark foundations for your
darkest purses and really light
foundations for your lightest person
that way no one is left out and make up
forever foundation so if you're one of
these peoples like I can never fill my
shade of foundation oh I'll make it
forever and I suggest getting someone to
help you pick your shade because they
can't get complicated the Beauty Blender
is making this foundation blend out so
beautifully that I don't even want to
use my brush on this side I'm going to
but seriously like it's making it super
airbrush and my Beauty Blender does good
things for me but I've never seen it
make excuse me
like look how smooth that looks blending
out the foundation again it's definitely
providing some coverage I don't feel
like I look too cakey though let's say
medium coverage but I would say if I
added another like amount another full
pump of this I would definitely have
full coverage foundation I'm talking
full full coverage foundation this did
seem to dry kind of quick so maybe not
applying it to your face would be the
best method may be like just applying a
little bit dabbing it out and then going
to the other side upon and instead of
what I just did because it does kind of
dry quick and I still can't get over the
color like yes I'm going to do a
close-up in a real close-up and I'm
going to let you look at my skin look at
the freckles on my nose they're always
really prominent no matter what
foundation I use and this is a good way
to reference the coverage like they're
barely peeking through and that was with
one layer
as most foundations do on me if you can
see these really fine forehead wrinkles
I do notice it setting in those just a
little bit I definitely don't feel like
I have a matte finish with us looking
like a close-up you guys don't see any
shine I don't see any shine at all it is
a very natural finish just applying it
to my face I want to just give you guys
a few thoughts that I have it's a very
natural finish I have mm not too matte
but I'm not shiny at all which we'll see
what happens throughout the day
I have no concealer on right now and I
mean I look smooth as a baby's bottom
under here I don't really even see that
much darkness which it's kind of rare
for one coat of foundation I think I
personally will be ever doing more than
one layer of this foundation really
liking it so far like I did I just tried
it on I'm going to wear it around for a
couple hours and just see like if I get
oily in any areas and I get grazie
if it like fades off how long wearing it
is um it did try quick but I do feel
like my face it's just a little bit
moist from it still like it hasn't
settled in yet I probably have had it on
for five minutes now let me go over the
claims of it and then I'll go away for a
few hours and I'll come back and I'll
tell you guys how it looks it's the
best-selling HD foundation that appears
more invisible comfortable and
natural-looking than ever I mean it is
pretty natural-looking but I feel like
we know I have makeup on because of how
powerful that coverage is nobody's face
is one is that color but I get what
they're saying it just gives you such a
flawless finish that it looks natural
foundation is supposed to be really
great for pictures and being on camera
says it is lightweight coverage now that
I've won it for a little over 5 minutes
I can feel this it's getting less sticky
and it's starting to feel more like skin
I think we should take a little
intermission watch and see how
long-lasting it is so I'll be back in
like 3 to 4 hours 3 hours they do hey
guys it's been about 3 hours I would say
and I really want to revoke my lashes
right
but I just wanted to say I'm candy my
mouth discovered in the box of the
makeup you actually get a little sample
of the primer that I use so it's
probably good for about two uses so
whenever you first get foundation you
can try it out with this exact same
primer and see if you like it this is me
after about three hours like two hours
and 50 minutes and I feel like I look
the exact same
I didn't put any blush bronzer or
concealer on because we just want to
focus on the validation today this area
is my shine area so I mean I feel like I
stayed pretty gosh-darn matte maybe a
little shiny right there but other than
that just pretty much matte i all go
away for about like another hour and a
half or so and I'll come back and we'll
follow up with the long lasting this
this kind of fun two hours later okay
guys it got kind of dark outside so I
turned on my glam core lights which you
may see like I did little cooler mess in
the lighting rather than a warm tone
lining but I hope you can still see the
foundation really well the foundation is
immaculate as far as long lasting nose
the only thing I noticed it faded around
my mouth because I went in ate dinner
got a little crazy won't lady I didn't
notice any fading of the foundation like
it's it's still hanging in there strong
right now I am noticing a little bit of
grease eNOS let you see a little bit
shine right here Here I am noticing it
shining just a wee bit and right here so
I am going to go ahead and recommend
that if you have oily skin or you just
have those spots that have all a skin
I do recommend just setting it normally
I would set it with a powder anyways you
have extremely oily skin the foundation
is going to be great for you because I
know a lot of times with extremely Oly
skin your foundation can kind of slough
off and disappear throughout the day
this foundation light was locked and
loaded today I probably Pat it on for
five and a half hours I want to say
total from the time I started the video
till now I'm definitely gonna be using
it more I love the color that I picked
out I love the way it went on my skin
especially with a Beauty Blender I liked
it with a Beauty Blender more than my
kabuki brush which is really
for me because I always prefer Kabuki
brush over be blender but you know times
are changing how dry skin which I have
dry skin I recommend using this
foundation with the nourishing primer
because going to add this like a little
bit of moisture into your skin before
you apply the foundation and like it's
set on my face so friggin beautiful it
did like I showed you get a little bit
oily in certain areas but I recommend
setting it and I did with this anyways
that is my rundown on the makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation this is the new one
I don't know more about it check the
description box I'm sure I'll type a
little paragraph about it let you guys
know further thoughts on it cuz I'm
going to be wearing it for the next few
days okay follow me on my social media
cuz I love you guys so much and I want
to say connect it with you guys and
subscribe that way you don't lose me out
in the YouTube world because it's
dangerous out there that's it for this
video and I'll see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
