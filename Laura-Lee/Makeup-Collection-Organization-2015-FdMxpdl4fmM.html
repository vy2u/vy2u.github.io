hey guys today's video is going to be on
what you see behind me my makeup
collection I have definitely added to my
collection and changed of everything so
I wanted to share with you most people
start off this video saying it is their
most requested video but uh definitely
not my most requested video but I
thought I'd share it with you anyways
because who doesn't love watching a good
old fashioned makeup collection video I
know I do my hair is in a massive ball
of craziness on top of my head today
because I don't wash my hair and three
day dry shampoo and who cares because
you won't be seeing much of me we're
gonna be focusing on the makeup
collection I can't wait to share you
share with you guys all my organizing
that I've been working on which you may
not look very organized but just know I
tried
I do have an excess of makeup but being
a beauty blogger you don't use the same
one foundation every day you don't use
your same one favorite bronzer every day
you use a variety of makeup you review
things so you accumulate a lugg makeup
and I've been on YouTube for almost two
years now and before that I was a makeup
quarter so it just gets crazy but I
didn't clean out my collection and I
revamped it so if you're interested in
saying all this fancy smancy stuff well
then please just keep watching
this is where the magic happens I they
completely change out the way I said it
my makeup and I added an entire new Alex
9 door system over here so I wanted to
share with you guys my new and improved
makeup collection and I hope you're
excited and we're going to talk fast so
this video isn't over 20 minutes long
we're going to start on the first Alex 9
door system and we'll start with what's
on top it is this rickety acrylic box
that I got a TJ Maxx and you guys this
box drives me crazy it's so loud and
annoying but I had to bring it back
because I got some new stuff in and I
didn't have nowhere to put it
what you're seeing on top is just my
little mini perfumes and then you're
also seeing this next book and you may
be wondering what this is and I will
show you the NYX unveiled event they get
made picture books for us so yeah how
cool is that I'll do it one more time
that's me Michelle getting down Wow keep
that up there and I just have a kitty
cat because we all know I'm a crazy cat
lady now over here I have all my Milani
eyeshadows I just don't really keep them
in a particular order because when I go
to use them I normally dump them all out
on my desk I'm a messy makeup artist
some people are neat makeup artist I am
NOT okay guys how to kill the ring like
so it's putting a glare next sure I had
my NYX eyeshadow I could do a better job
of organizing them but I haven't I want
to deport them but that's going to take
me forever and these are their new
eyeshadows that are just gorgeous I have
them all on decided and have all my next
regular eyeshadows in no particular
order right here summer turned sideways
because they wouldn't all fit whoops
the other way we have more eyeshadows I
have my NYX baked pigment I have my
makeup eight pigments I have my eye
candy glitters I'm a color pop
eyeshadows and then I have more of the
NYX a new line other eyeshadows I
wouldn't fit in the top drawers I just

so some of these may or may not be
incorporated in a giveaway they're all
filled I've used like three or four of
them I'm just a lipstick kind of girl
make sure I have my Gerard lip glosses
now these are the colors that I don't
use that often I have another setup for
the colors that are just my go-to but I
like to keep them here I do use these
colors but just not on the regular so
