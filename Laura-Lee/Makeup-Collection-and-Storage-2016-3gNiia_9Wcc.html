hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be exciting because
I'm going to show you I'm going to show
you guys my makeup collection and
storage and how I store it all and what
I'm packing it let me go just wanted to
answer very few questions really quick
in the beginning of this video because I
might last a while while while back I
did a makeup collection video and I got
a lot of the same questions is why do
you have that much makeup well my beauty
bloggers have this youtube channel I
have a full Beauty blog where I write I
have a makeup Instagram account so lots
of products are sent to me I would say
85 to 90% of my products are sent to me
yes I consider myself very blessed also
another question I got is um do I wear
all this makeup if it's in my drawer
chances are I'm going to get to wearing
it or something that I'm wearing and
rotation I really wear the same makeup
over and over and over again because I
am a beauty blogger and I like to
constantly be trying out and switching
up my products so you guys can know
about them and know my thoughts on them
it's just part of my job and what I do
and that's why there's so much of it yes
I donate makeup that I don't use if it
expires I toss it if it's not going to
expire and I'm not using anymore it goes
to donations or a family member I want
to make this a long intro because these
videos get really freakin long but we're
gonna do it let's do it you enjoyed that
bag hey guys I have that Alex 9 jour
system which pretty much every youtuber
has because of its size convenience in
the way it looks it's awesome so I
recommend it anyways the first drawer is
my concealer draw and color correctors
and so right over here I have a lot of
benefit products I haven't gotten to
play with yet and then these are my most
used concealer products have some NARS
or McCain Mac NYX you see me use this
stuff all the time and my videos and
then over here is just different things
like color correctors so towards the
back and it's kind of hard to see we
have just a couple of more benefit
products and some ziwei concealers and a
lot of la girl concealer and just some
additional
concealers back there which I do go
through my drawers like I send the intro
and kind of clean now and rearrange
stuff that I'm not using to give away
and our next door is obviously my color
pop drawer I had so many single color
pop eyeshadows it gets its own drawer
there's not really any rhyme or rhythm
to a love color pop eyeshadows they're
only five dollars each so it gets its
own dedicated drawer
our next Shore is an overflow of mascara
I love mascaras I pretty much never use
the same mascara two days in a row I
constantly switch them out so they're
all getting a little bit of love so
right here are my all-time favorite
mascaras I put them in this drawer right

primer water as well as a backup this is
a hydrating spray and then my skin today
B is setting sprays these are awesome
awesome and I just want to mention you
guys if you're wondering why I have
silver down it's because it's a
reflector when I film it helps balance
the light up and just makes it brighter
so that's why I have a silver topping on
the disc
