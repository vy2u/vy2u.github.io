much for doing that for my subscriber
family this primary is the first product
Smashbox created at their photo studios
here in LA it is their best-selling
product and it's there to smooth out the
skin imperfections and even make your
makeup last longer hello makeup always
looks amazing with a facial primer the
day I started wearing a facial primer my
life was change
let's get into the video first we're
going to start off with a primer don't
I'm going to be using the Smashbox photo
finish primer and a mistake people make
is using way too much primer and
creating a greasy mess so a facial
primer do is just using a very small
amount of primer as you can see it's
like a pea-sized amount and I massage it
into my skin the next is a facial primer
don't and sometimes primers like this
one that is great for pores you don't
have to rub it all over your whole tire
face and neck area it's unnecessary and
you don't need that much product on your
face so that's definitely a primer don't
but a primer do is use a pea-sized
amount and massage it into problem areas
that you want smoothed out and primers
are miracle products that can smooth out
imperfections and leaving your
foundation looking absolutely
yes girl yes next up is a don't I have
seen people a Prai apply primers on top
of their foundation don't do this guy's
primer is meant for under a foundation
to give you that flawless soft looking
skin so definitely don't apply it right
on top of that foundation except for our
primer do is to apply it first people
apply it first and then put your
foundation right on top you will be
pleased with the outcome for our first
foundation don't is the color of your
foundation I clearly got ten walls on
vaycay and you don't want to just go in
with some deep deep deep foundation you
want to kind of match it to your neck
and jawline and bronze it up with a
bronzer not your foundation so I found
they should do is to be sure and match
your foundation just with your jawline
and if it still looks a little pale you
can warm it up with a bronzer not with
your whole face with the foundation so
next up for our foundation don't is
rubbing the foundation in people don't
get aggressive when rubbing your
foundation in I have a horrible habit of
doing this myself I have to admit you
want to be gentle on your skin we only
get one skin or whole life so treat it
well you know give it a break and a
foundation do is to stipple the
foundation not to swipe back and forth
because you'll end up with brush streaks
in your foundation you definitely want
to tap it and stipple it Foundation and
kind of a primer don't is to apply your
foundation right on top of your primer
just as soon as you put it on give it
like one minute 60 seconds maybe even
two minutes to let it settle into your
skin eye foundation do is to let it
settle into your skin you know what I
mean just wait give it a minute
let it chill what I hang out on your
skin give it however much time you have
I would say at least 60 seconds you know
playing your phone scroll through the IG
and then apply your foundation to your
skin for our next foundation don't it is
applying the foundation just to the face
and you may ask Laura whatever do you
mean
but do you see if you avoid the ear and
jaw line you end up with that famous
foundation line ah for our foundation do
you definitely don't want to drag the
foundation around the hairline around
the neck the jaw line you can bring it
down your neck but I just prefer to drag
it all the way underneath my face and
but into my ear and hairline as well
that way it's kind of like a seamless
finish and no one knows you're wearing
makeup
just kidding we'll still know but it'll
look nice for our next town nation don't
don't begin liberal with your foundation
pumping out half the dadgum bottle
wasting your foundation and just taking
it on the face hmm
do not do anything that I just did ever
in your life thank you very much for our
foundation do you definitely want to
apply a thin layer of foundation and
then build upon it build up that extra
coverage you can always go back in and
add but it's so hard to take away be
careful people foundation can be
dangerous for our foundation don't is
applying a foundation to powder on top
of full coverage foundation now I do
this if I'm going to be wearing my
foundation for an hour or two but if you
have to wear it for eight hours it can
very quickly become a cakey heavy mess
on your face so you don't want to add
foundation powder on top of foundation
if you're going to be wearing it for a
long period of time especially if you
plan on getting hot and sweaty avoid
this a foundation do is to always set
your foundation but deal with a mineral
powder or a translucent powder something
light and that isn't going to get cakey
on you throughout the day
and for our last foundation don't is do
not apply a foundation powder and then a
foundation on top it's just a hard and
pastoral and makeup you don't want to
put creams on top of powders but yeah
you do want to put your powders on top
of creams thank you guys so much for
watching comment down below if this
video helped you out and I hope to see
you in my next video bye guys
