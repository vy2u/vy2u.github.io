video is going to be a makeup tutorial
with a little bit of pop of color and a
lip with a bit of shine for once I'm
super excited for you to see it I'm a
professional shoulder dancer oh you know
what comment I get all the time is that
I remind people of Alyssa Edwards from
RuPaul's Drag Race ah my alter ego does
anyone else notice the amount of neck
hair I have rooting out no matter what I
do I can't control it all so in today's
video I'm going to show you a new
product from NARS this is their lip
glide and this is the one I have on my
lips right now this one is in shade
bound this is a very exciting new
interesting product I went with bound
which is a beautiful mauve pink toned
color so these have a very unique
formula to them they kind of glide on
like a gloss but give you that
pigmentation of a lipstick they are a
very nourishing product to wear very
comfortable on the lips they feel very
velvety with a semi matte color finish I
feel like the 13 shades are universally
flattering and compliment all skin tones
that they're very beautiful shade NARS
has been sup my holy grail makeup since
I really got into makeup I've always
been a big fan of NARS so I'm very
excited to introduce the NARS lip glide
- yeah anyways we're going to jump right
in this tutorial I hope you enjoy it be
sure and subscribe to my channel before
you leave so you don't miss out my other
makeup tutorials and fun videos like
that we're going to jump right in and
get started to begin we're going to
start off with priming our skin with a
bye bye pores primer by it cosmetics I'm
going to massage this into places that
my pores are a little bit more prominent
and I want to smooth them out this will
give us a good look under our foundation
I'm going to be using the vanish
foundation which is super full coverage
by hourglass I'm going to apply this all
over my face you don't have to use as
much foundation as you see me using I
just want to be very full coverage so
I'm gonna apply a lot of products and
I'm going to be using my our teeth brush
to blend this up on my face it works
very well and this is a
very quick way to blend out a
full-coverage foundation voila it is
done next up I'm going to conceal my
face using one of my favorite concealers
this is the NARS cream you radiant
concealer and shade custard I'm going to
highlight my face I like my concealer to
be one to two shades lighter than my
foundation that way it gives us a little
bit about highlighting glowy effect so
I'm just applying that in the usual
areas and then I'm gonna end up blending
it out with my Beauty Blender yes girl
yes I love using the Beauty Blender to
blend out concealer and foundation
products because it leaves it looking
seamless without any brushstrokes it's
just a very quick way to blend out your
product Beauty blenders are worth the
price
I'm gonna take my the same setting
powder I have been enjoying this one
lately as most of you guys already know
I've been talking about it a lot and I'm
going to go ahead and set my face and
now I'm going to do a weird head bob to
show you I'm done baking
moving on to eyes we're going to be
using the morphe at 30
OS palette I believe it's called we're
going to take a lighter shimmery Brown
color this this palette Saul shimmers
and so is this eye look so we're going
to take a lighter shimmery brown color
I'm gonna start working it in the crease
as well as really focusing it in the
outer corner and then when I have a
little bit of product left on my brush
I'm going to swing it on in to the inner
corner because we're going to be
focusing in our outer corner but leaving
the center of the eye plane so I don't
have much product on my brush there then
I'm going to move on to a little bit
more of a deeper shimmery brown color
and I'm going to pop it right into the
crease but I'm not going to take it up
quite this high and I'm really going to
try to add a little bit of depth to this
look and make it a little bit more
dramatic I love the drama now I'm going
to grab my morphe 22 brush and just
soften up that edges so there's no harsh
lines now we're going to move into an
even deeper color and with a smaller
look see beauty brush I'm just going to
pop it into the inner corner as well as
the outer corner just really defining
this corners and then blending
everything out now it's time for the
lighter shade we're going to go bright
shimmery shade with an F 70 brush from
Sigma and push this into the center of
the lid
and just to really make it pop I'm going
to add a little bit of glitter too right
on top and I love the sparkle it's so
pretty and I really think it makes this
look pop now I'm just going to touch up
those inner and outer corners with a the
deepest Brown that we were using and as
Sigma is such a brutal Scheels just
topping it on the bang shell not to get
too crazy top top top now I'm going to
sweep away any of the baking powder
I liked the baking powder and leave it
there I'm just in case I have any
eyeshadow fell out but that way I can
just sweep it away and it won't stick to
my skin and then I'm going to highlight
the brow bone with just the lightest
shimmery color that we used in the
center of our lid and an oversized brush
I don't know why I'm using a brush this
big so for the funnest part I'm going to
take a little bit of this coppery color
and I'm just going to pop it on the
lower lash line if you don't like the
pop of color you can just do brown but I
want it to add something different to
this look so I added just a little bit
of color a fiery look I'm going to apply
it some falsies I don't know the name of
these but I'll have a link down below
there by icon and then I'm going to
bronze up my skin per usual I'm in
loving joues bronzer in Sun Tan I apply
it to kind of carve out my cheekbones
around the temple area where the
sunlight would naturally hit your skin
and then I normally go ahead and add it
to the lower lip area and the jaw line
just so it's evenly distributed around
my face next up is for a really weird
dance and then we're going to highlight
our Fleance I'm going to be using the
jus a highlight this was in rose course
with a Sigma f40 too this is a little
fan brush and get it poppin I love the
way this highlight looks and of course I
always run it down my nose and add a
little bit to my Cupid's bow and I'm
getting real crazy to my forehead now
I'm going to be using the NARS Velvet
lip glide in the shade bound these are
so soft and creamy very velvety and they
have a lot of pigments so I really like
this color it's like a great mommy pink
I think this would look good on it was
any
skintone and I think it matches this
look really great this one is a perfect
color for an everyday look so I'm just
going to apply this all over my lips and
this is the finished look I hope you
