this tutorial is creating this warm tone
brown smokey eye which is a beautiful
go-to for me first we're going to start
off with priming the skin I normally
always prime my skin before I apply my
foundation and I'm just going to apply
the Neutrogena shine control primer to
my face it's going to help obviously
reduce shine control but it's also a
little bit moisturizing so I'm going to
go ahead and apply it all over the face
then I'm going to go in it with my
Neutrogena shine control foundation the
shade I am currently is 70 fresh beige
and I'm going to apply that all over my
face and then I'm going to blend it out
with the f88 angled kabuki brush from
Sigma basically I'm going to be doing
swiping motions and patting motions
making sure not to get any brush streaks
in my face
I have already primed my eyelids on the
mac paint pot and I'm going in with
Peach Smoothie from mega peak in a dome
shape brush from morphe I'm just going
to blend this basically all over the lid
especially in the crease what it's going
to do is help soften up that eye primer
and help the other colors blend out much
more easy as you notice the color barely
shows up so it's not really to show up
it's basically there to soften up the
eye primer that can be a little bit
harsh when starting out now I'm going in
with this palette from you Gigi know
this is their nourishing eyeshadows and
I'm going to take the lightest shade or
rather and when I apply it to the brow
bone as our highlight shade and again
this is just going to smooth out the
primer then going in with chickadee from
make it peak this color looks intense
but we are going to build up on it and
it's not going to be so intense going in
with an e25
Sigma which is kind of like a flat
fluffy blending brush I'm going to pop
this shade and focus it right in the
crease I'm going to do small circular
motions winning all the way from the
inner to the outer corner making sure it
is nice and seamless then I'm going to
go in with a little bit of
Lulay which is just a little bit more of
a really light brown color and I'm going
to build up the color this is going to
help dole down a little bit that orange
color we put on our lid and going in
with that same e 25 brush from Sigma
blending small circular motions to inner
to outer corner from inner to outer
corner never stopping
next I'll go in with the shade mocha for
make a peak which is a great matte dark
brown staple color to have in your
collection I'm taking a little bit more
of a flat blending brush than the 825
this one from morphe I'll put it down
below but I'm focusing that mocha color
right in the crease I'm putting it right
on top of creme brulee but I'm not going
to bring it up quite as high because you
don't want your darker colors to touch
your brow bone area you just want to
keep them focused right in the crease
that's going to give you definition and
depth then going in with cocoa bear
which is one of my favorite color from
makeup geek I'm going to pop this right
on the lid I'm pressing it on the lid
with a flat shader brush this one is
from Too Faced I am using the most
random brushes in the world for this
tutorial sorry about that guys but
basically I'm going to cover the whole
entire lid and I'm bring it right up to
the crease where that dark brown color
starts and I'm going to stop right there
then I'm going back in with a little bit
of mocha on my brush just to soften up
that harsh line with the colors meet
then I'm going in with my favorite matte
black color this is corrupt taking the
teeny tiniest amount of it on a flat
blending brush I'm going to pop this
right in the crease and I'm going to
take it up even a less higher than I did
the mocha color as you can see we're
really just building up colors here and
we're taking them a little bit lower
every time we apply them next I decided
to wing it out on this one if you're not
comfortable with winged liner simply
draw a thick black line of liner above
your upper lash line and define your
eyes but you know yo girl loves that
drama so she's gonna wing it out for
this tutorial I'm going to be using the
eo6
brush from Sigma this is a great
eyeliner brush to create that winged
liner and I'm just going to create the
wing that I create in every tutorial
next I'm going to highlight my face
first going in with the NARS creamy
radiant concealer in custard just going
to apply that a little bit on the inner
corner and then I'm really going to
highlight my face with my Mac prep and
prime pin in bright forecast this is a
lot thinner formula than the actual
concealer so it's not quite as heavy
makeup on your face but yet you still
get the highlighting benefit then I'm
going to take the f88 kabuki brush and
just pack that out instead of doing
swiping motions which okay I'm doing
swiping motions then but first I like to
push it into the skin and then I'll
swipe it out and blend it out making
sure there's no streaky brushstrokes
next I'll take my Neutrogena setting
power this has quickly become one of my
all-time favorite setting powders I've
used it about three or four tutorials
I'm going to set that concealer with it
it's going to help the concealer last
longer
it's going to help it be brighter it's
also going to help it not decrease up so
there's many benefits in setting your
concealer then going in with the m20
makeup forever
profusion bronzer and this the first
time I used it on my face so I'm just
kind of checking it out you're seeing
what I think and basically I kind of
contour my face we're going to ended up
blending it out and bringing it up a
little bit higher just to bronze up the
skin that way I'm not looking too too
pasty and everything is matching matchy
if you're ever in a hurry
I recommend skipping the contouring and
just kind of bronzing your face because
you want to
definitely take your time blending when
you're actually contouring your face I'm
also going to run a little business down
the nose with a flat little shader brush
next I'm going to go in with this
healthy skin blush from Neutrogena and
shade rosy this is also becoming one of
my favorite blushes from the drugstore
I'm going to pop this on the apples of
my cheek and work it back then going in
with champagne pop I see you Jacqueline
who from Becca cosmetics with a fan
brush I'm going to pop this on to the
upper cheekbone area and run a tweak up
down the nose then going in with
chickadees at oranjee color I'm going to
swipe this from inner to outer corner
you can't neglect our lower lash line
peoples so then I'm going to take a
little bit of cocoa bear and a mid
sleeper brush from Sigma I'm going to
swipe this from inner into outer corner
right on top of chickadee then with an
angle brush I'm gonna take a little bit
of corrupt and I'm going to run it right
below the lower lash line and next I'll
take a little brush and I will swipe
back and forth just to blend all this
out and make sure it's really soft and
really gradient we don't want any harsh
lines and we're going to really smoke it
out when doing this and it's going to
give us that nice smoky eye then I'm
going in with my Marc Jacobs high liner
this is a black eyeliner that will last
all day and night I'm going to fill in
the waterline I'm also going to put a
little bit in the inner corners just
when my eyeliner doesn't come all the
way down then I'll go in with my healthy
Volume Mascara from Neutrogena and give
my lashes a few good coats and I'll
especially coat those bottom lashes
really well with it
you
and next I'm going to apply some
dramatic lashes these are iconic my
house of lashes whenever I do a pretty
smoky eye and a thick wing liner I like
to go ahead and add the drama by doing
big lashes next i'm going in with
stripped down from mac to line my lips
I'm also going to fill in the inner
corners of the lips with this this is
one of my favorite pencils whenever I
created a nude lip it just gives it a
little bit of definition that way your
lips aren't just one solid color nude
then I'll go in with honey love by Mac I
haven't used this lipstick in forever I
just dug it out and I was like I think
I'm going to use it for this tutorial so
I'm going to pop that onto my lips and
covering right over the strip down color
this is a beautiful nude color and then
when I go back in and define the lips a
little bit with that strip down color
and that's it for this tutorial
give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed guys
