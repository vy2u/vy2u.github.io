video is going to be my monthly stop
this is gonna be my March favourites
March was such a busy busy busy month
for me I went to Minnesota hmm and went
to Texas we get beautiful creamy green
cheese Louise we did a lot in this month
and now that I'm sober
capisci is gone so I'm gonna talk to you
guys about the parties that I've been
loving zemo's it's a good part trying to
mention to you or the products that were
my makeup bag that I've used non-stop
for the month of March and I just fell
in love with all over again all over
again I'm having trouble speaking I'm
always having trouble speaking
they should have subscribe to our
channel before you leave okar and we'll
jump right in get started mm-hmm I start
off with our favorite song in the month
and favorite TV show of the month and
we're gonna switch it up just to win
delay up the clause I didn't get to
watch a lot of TV due to the fact that
well actually my favorite TV show of the
month is better call Saul it comes on
the AMC is the best it's like um spinoff
of Breaking Bad but anyway I want to
share with you a book because I just was
gone a lot so I read whenever I fly a
lot of you I know are shocked that um I
know how to read but I do small words
book it's called a stolen life is by
Jaycee Dugard the girl that was adducted
at age 11 and found 18 years later and
her abductor sexually abused her for 18
years she had two kids by them and it's
just a very interesting book she toast
her whole complete entire story she
toast where she's at today she tells not
only her story but her thought process
along the whole entire way and she was a
very very strong girl and like obviously
the Philip was the guy who did it
he obviously tried to brainwash her into
thinking what he was doing okay was okay
but it was just really interesting to
read her thought process through it all
and how he was never truly able to
brainwash her I don't know what kind of
strong mindset it takes to be a person
like her but she was just always like
I'm gonna do it so I don't he doesn't
hurt me but you know he's crazy
this is not right really good read like
even if you don't like reading books
this is some good stuff right here you
need you need to read it okay
and the month is DJ snakes in the middle
you know what I'm talking about
now let's jump into makeup products what
two things about pure cosmetics the
first one is this brand new bronzer
palette look how big it is like the size
of my head it's really gorgeous it comes
with this like nice brown packaging
actually this is what the box looks like
how balm is that many ways is a huge
bronzer and you open it up and you get
three matte shades and three shimmer
shades so you can mix it all together or
you can use the matte in this shimmer
I've really been enjoying it I have on
the mat today just to kind of contour
actually makes all three of the matte
shades together we're gonna be doing a
giveaway on my Instagram giving away
this and their two new strobing palettes
have just launched like one day ago yeah
be sure to follow me on instagram i'll
put my instagram right here in the rules
will be to follow up here in me and like
comment down below something easy like
that to enter and we're gonna give away
all that good stuff by the way this
stuff is sold on like Pure's website as
well as Ulta pure sold at Ulta all that
jazz
I love their products I personally think
they're a little bit of an underrated
brand they're really really really good
makeup and I want to share the love
because they're amazing so the second
product I wanted to mention to you guys
by Pierre is their fully charged mascara
this is you see me if you want to follow
me on Instagram I use this almost every
day it's a nice big bristly wand and I
actually love the formula of the mascara
a lot it's really nice now I do normally
wear false lashes everyday but I love
something that will quote my lashes and
dry quick that way either if I'm not
wearing false lashes I can build up a
second layer of mascara quickly or if
I'm wearing false lashes they don't goop
together because whenever I put them I
felt slashes I need my mascara to be dry
okay a hair always tries to creep around
my neck and strangle me I don't know why
but it does
moving on to the next product is this
little pigment by Inglot this is the
number 22 eyeshadow pigment and I
ordered these on Macy's website which
was so random but they're not sold at
Sephora or Ulta which is normally where
I buy higher in makeup honey a breeze
I'm on that Macy's website because I
remembered Oh indigestion I remembered a
long time ago that we were shopping
around for makeup and I saw these
beautiful pigments by Inglot and at the
time I don't have enough money to be
buying these because they cost like 23 a
piece I think let's just kind of pricey
for one eyeshadow but it's a pigment
since they last a long time but anyways
other day I was like oh so I ordered a
few but my favorite has been number 22
and every time I pack it onto my eyelid
I normally do with just my finger
someone says oh my gosh what do you have
on your eyes I'm like oh yes girls by
Inglot occur next product is the essay
edit poor vanishing stick so this is a
new product from Estee Lauder it was
sent to me however I almost bought it in
store because I saw it at support and I
just I didn't know what the essay edit
was I didn't know that was Estee Lauder
so I don't know it's like I don't know
this brand okay gonna end up getting it
and then I came home and it was in the
mail I am so blessed pried it out and
it's amazing and let me tell you why it
looks like those little eyeball in it
it's a poor vanishing steak therefore
normally if you have large pores you're
dealing with oily skin not always but a
lot of the time and these silicone based
primers are there to help vanish the
pores can be heavy and greasy so it's
like this double-edged sword and it
doesn't work out this is a silicone
based primer but it's so lightweight and
so thin it didn't make my skin greasy
whatsoever and I did a great job of
smoothing out the imperfection texture
of my skin so I think they did a great
job creating this product and I really
recommend it next up is a realist I just
I just watched this brush so it's like
all sparkly and clean and anyways moving
on this is the small duo fiber brush f55
by sigma beauty so this is its mama
right here come on little guy this is
mama this is the baby so the mama is the
f50 this the f55 and I was just wanted
to mention the f55 to you guys I like
both brushes for a really airbrushed
finish I'm
like kind of looks like you had one of
those airbrush machines these brushes to
do that if you use them correctly what I
like to do is very lightly stipple out
the concealer and I like to do concealer
cream contour and highlight with this
because it's small enough where it can
get right up in there where it's not big
enough it's not going to move around
your product too much like the s50 will
and I also like to UM stipple out my
cheek contour now you have to work a
little more with blending and spend a
little more time if you're gonna use the
duo fiber brushes because the bristles
are just so thin but at the same time if
you do with a light hand has spent a
little more time stippling it out I'm
talking flawless finish makeup um so I
love these especially I guess that for
the contour because it's not this
massive brush where it moves the product
around too much you can just really keep
your product right where you need it
I've been obsessing with cream contour
which leads us to our next product this
contour set by Makeup Forever this is
the approach hello-o sculpting palette
Norrell 30 honestly when I first got
this I was like another contouring
palette palette and didn't think much of
it but awkwardly enough it's like been
the best contouring palette ever so this
shade right here is a nice brown color
and it look like had a little bit of a
lunch tone on it but whenever I get it
all over my face or where I want it to
go
it really doesn't and it looks nice and
then this shade right here is a great
concealer shade these are very very very
creamy and easy to blend out but this I
have been using so much I've been using
to cover blemishes obviously I didn't
today also been using this as my eye
primer instead of using my mac paint pot
by painterly I normally carve out the
brows and then I'll just prime my eyes
with it but um what happened was I
accidentally left my Paint Pot at home
when I was traveling so I was like darn
it I'll just use this concealer and I
fell in love with it after my eyeshadow
primer so I'm using it so much next up
is a product by xu wei this is a daily
clarifying oil treatment so this is
probably one of you a's best products
made besides their liquid lipsticks this
is also probably one of their best
sellers i would have to say i see this
people using this all the time but i
like to use this a number
waise it's just a beauty oh this one's
like anti-aging the how one for acne but
the one that I like for anti-aging is
because what I like to do is at the end
of the night after I wash my face I'll
drop two drops in my hands rub my hands
together and pat it on my skin for a
little bit of extra hydration sometimes
what I also like to do is put two drops
my hands run it through and rub it
through my hair it's so good for your
hair as well just to give it a little
bit of hydration and it doesn't leave
your hair greasy or your skin greasy coz
trust me I in about that life but these
make up also a trick I like to do as
well is sometimes I have contour
palettes that are a little bit stiff and
cakey and I will put like one drop of
the old in it or on my sponge or
whatever and blend it it just makes
everything better it like brings the
makeup back to life okay next up is the
Boscia charcoal pour pudding intensive
wash off treatment
honestly this confused me a little bit
at first but I read the directions for
the first time in my life and then I
understood it so basically I take a cat
tongue brush which looks like this is
just a flat synthetic brush looks like
cat tongue I will dip it into this and
smooth this out all over my skin it is a
treatment it's it's kind of like a mask
but it's a little different because it
never actually dries and I think that's
why they call it poor pudding but it has
white charcoal and black charcoal and
they work together to minimize the
appearance of pores funny story is I
Tyler has the real poor problem okay and
I put this a little bruised face and
he's like it's burning me really bad and
I had it all over my face too and I'm
like it doesn't burn it can you just be
quiet and just keep wearing it until
it's time to wash it off you have large
pores you're being a baby bah bah bah
bah bah and then I washed it off and on
sight you got a real bad rash you're
allergic wife of the year we're so
annoying to each other but anyways that
happened and he's allergic I'm not it
didn't bother my skin at all
I really liked it so I'm gonna keep
using that so that is it for this
monthly favorites I hope you guys
