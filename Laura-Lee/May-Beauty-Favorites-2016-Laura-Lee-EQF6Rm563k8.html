is going to be in my new oh I think I've
mentioned before my channel I don't know
if I did but I am I moved on into LA I
was living on the outskirts and I was
like it's time so I have a new home it
was an apartment and what's happening
and it's awesome and it's beautiful and
I am very very happy with my move
however this move has absolutely taking
every piece of energy out of my body and
I even hired movers and it's just so
much to move like off to the side of me
over here it's just like explosion of
crap it's just so much and my brain is
gonna explode pretty soon but I'm gonna
give it all together I know I can do it
so good to be back filming this is my
beauty room what do you guys think about
this background for a little bit I want
it to kind of kick the flat backgrounds
just for a little bit they will be back
I wanted to switch it up though I've
been doing you know the plain
backgrounds for a while and I told you
guys I would bring back a little bit of
person that I'll be into the videos once
I move and now I have moves and here's a
little piece of my personality today's
gonna be my monthly favorites video and
I just want to let you guys know about
my collaboration without a boss I will
have this week a video going on talking
about the palette I've already announced
the launch date it's on my Instagram so
check that out when another launch dates
but I will mention that in the video on
my palette before the launch day you
will know your calendars will be marked
I'll put them in the description box as
well we're gonna jump right into this
video be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave I would hate for you to
miss out on my craziness I would
absolutely hate that it would be
terrible so yeah now join the craziness
we always start off my channel with my
channel my video with my favorites video
with my favorite movie or TV show of the
month and my favorite TV shows a month
is brickleberry that's a TV show on
Netflix and it's super raunchy immature
and gross and I love it
because there's like this 16 year old
boy inside of me that kid inside of me
and I can't let go the cartoon thing so
I watch like family got American Dad and
now it's somewhat Palm brickleberry and
it's like American Dad family gone see
Royce cuz it's so much worse our goal
Barry's my shiz and then my favorite
song of the month I have to tell you on
my phone because Laura never knows
Laura's brain is in 50 different which I
said it by Calvin Harris and Rihanna so
you already knew it was a jam yeah you
did mm-hmm
I wonder how many people skip through my
favorite song in the TV show of the
month okay next up is my favorite is the
pure facial powder this is support and
one is a pressed powder and I love it a
lot it provides a really nice coverage
you can wear this alone or you can
sprinkle it lightly over your foundation
just help the coverage with your
foundation or it can even make your
makeup last longer I love that it has
SPF 15 correct SPF 15 and this product
so a lot of foundations like the Born
This Way Foundation have two big long
foundations I like to wear they don't
have any sunscreen for protection in it
which um you know mama it's a night
wrinkle this is such a nice way of
springing a little protection on top of
your foundation as well as helping the
coverage whenever you set any type of
makeup with a powder you're going to
make it last longer
facial primers don't typically make your
makeup last longer they just help the
appearance of your skin under your
makeup that's just a misconception that
even I've made with facial primers I'm
guilty of me I'm like oh no I can make
it last longer whole and then I'm like I
really love this form one powder by
Pierre it's awesome and I think the
little glass packaging is so pretty and
chic next let's talk about a new product
from benefit really exciting I was a lot
bigger we've been witness month hey I
had a really great time I was coming to
New York with Becca cosmetics who
celebrate Jacqueline Hills new
collaboration I I was I'm all over the
place and then I moved what is happening
that's why I brain is going
but this is the brow positioner primer
by benefit and this is a really unique
cool product to me it comes with like a
grippy rubber applicator and you have
high like two clicks of this to your
eyebrows at night to condition them
remember it's hair so we gotta take care
of it we got a condition X we want those
full beautiful brows okay we got a lot
of brown going on I really like this
product I think it's very innovative to
create a conditioner for your brows to
help them grow and just nourish your
brows life though you can use two clicks
at night time to really get that in
there in a condition it and one click
for each brow during the day and if you
don't want you know there any texture or
grease on your brows during the day one
click suffice and it dries completely
and then you get your brow product on
top of it it's a really great product
next let's talk about hair I'm just
grabbing stuff randomly I'm really
excited right now
alright strive vecten here they came out
with shampoo and conditioner did you
know that I hope they were on this
skincare but I quickly learned they are
not and the packaging is just cute as a
baby's bottom I love this packaging I
don't know what is with the white and
like a neon coral so cute this one is
for color-treated hair and I normally
use my shimmering light shampoo which is
a purple toner in it and it helps the
blond on my hair not turn orange because
whenever you die such dark color hair
blonde it just wants to turn orange
that's just what I want to do and you
have to battle it with the shimmering
light shampoo but but in-between that
I've been using this first of all smells
so good I've gotten a lot of compliments
on my hair smelling good so I'm like
thanks I mean this one's for
color-treated hair and I think
definitely think it helps um nerves your
hair and it's full fight free let's talk
about something from pixie Beauty this
is the h2o skin drink I use this part of
my foundation routine this is a nice
affordable product for your skin and is
a clear gel to hydrate your skin makeup
steps so beautifully on drops on
hydrated skin but if your skin is very
dry it can get a little crazy and here
too dry patches
this is a great way to moisturize your
skin because to say gel moisturizer man
it's not gonna be greasy or k-cup and it
also dries very fast on your skin so
you're not like oh I have all this crap
in my face and now I have to put
foundation on you just put it on and
it's just like dry and your skin just
feels so nice and hydrated but not crazy
and there's a bonus it smells like pure
heaven next product by the way I'm not
sure if I mentioned this on my channel
before I could have you know I get a
little kooky but this is their
texturizing hairspray this bottle is
pretty much empty
I have a lot more under my cabinet don't
worry I use this every single day and I
don't know if I mentioned it but I was
like hello like I literally
subconsciously spray this in my hair
every day one the smells great
I like smell good too it just it's a
texture thing hair spray but it doesn't
feel like a hair spray you just put a
little bit of volume it helps your hair
curl nicely without the crunch it
doesn't like make sure hair like fluff
in like revamps your hair gives a little
bit of oomph
but out feeling crispy or crunchy so
it's an all-around great product and Jen
Atkins created this which she is known
for doing a lot of the Kardashians hair
so pretty cool two products that came
out from ziwei that I'm just like head
over heels for the first one is
illuminating body lotion I really love
this packaging I think it's so awesome
and just like clean and chic and pumps I
love him and I did a mermaid shoot with
you way I was turned into a mermaid it
was awesome and like a famous artist and
photographer came in and like he was
like very like yes do this all over my
body and like my eyes are closed well
that was just like going crazy on me and
I didn't know what they put on me and
then I looked at pictures from the shoot
I'm like oh my god look so dark and
glowy and luminous Wow great editing on
the picture and then I came home and I
looked in the mirror and I still look
like that guy like my skin looked
amazing and I asked and this is what
they put all over me so it gives a
little bit of tint to it
it smells like a honeysuckle
and it has just a little bit of glow
it's not glittery or shimmer it's just
like a little gives your skin a radiant
glow next thing I'm excited about is
their highlighter palette it's like five
eyes shadows five highlighters Laura get
your life together sore cream by the way
and I love them and the way that they
did it is they just took like a Beauty
Blender I'm gonna use there's a lot to
choose from I'm just gonna go with the
lightest one and they would dab it in
the product and just kind of maybe you
see that and you can even use it this
beauty blenders dry right now but you
can use a damp Beauty Blender and it's a
great way to use these cream highlights
they are beautiful and I really like the
arrangement of colors I love they come
in little palette and they like connect
or take off if you just want to wear one
up home so kind of like Tetris Tetris
I don't know tart is launching different
color or new colors and their lip paints
I like their lip paint because it's like
a liquid lipstick that doesn't dry
completely so you don't get that crafty
my lips are shriveling up into a
butthole kind of feel your lips gonna
say voluminous and plumped a little bit
with these because it's more of like a
whipped liquid lipstick extremely
pigmented but Browns and mommy's are
just my colors like I can't kick it I
can't get away from around mommies I got
to visit Tarte by the way hate our we're
really kind for having me at their
headquarters and showed me some of their
new line and this is some of the product
but um smells minty
this one is raved and gorgeous I mean
like that's just pure ma Venus I love it
next one it has a little bit more Brown
to 8-hd choker they're coming out with a
quite a few new shades but like these
are my favorites and then this one is a
brown so I absolutely adore the Beast my
last time you want to mention to you
guys is by toothpaste this is the sweet
tea bronzer and I don't know if I was
automatically attracted to it because
the name of it is sweet tea how cute and
what did that you gonna have to do with
a bronzer but it's just like so cute so
it looks like this and
one side is a bit shimmer they're both
shimmering one size deeper and the other
side's a little bit lighter you can even
use this type as a highlighter I like to
get crazy and like makes my brush all
over it and really bronze up my skin I
don't use this for contouring I like
more of a matte bronzer to contour and
structure out my cheekbones but I do use
this for just giving me that warm summer
glow in the summers right around our
corner is it summertime so much June so
let's say it's summertime I love this
and this wouldn't even have a little bit
of a golden hue and it and that is
literally it in my monthly favorite
that's like I talk so much because I do
I love you guys thank you so much for
