jeans holdin me closer til our eyes
good morning so I normally start my
mornings off being woken up by my kitten
like he drives me crazy in the morning
he wants me to get up and give him cat
treats I try to look at my iPad and
catch up on some social medias as I
think most people do but then there he
is he's ready to attack so I ended up
playing with him forever I could
seriously play with this little cat all
day he is the sweetest little thing in
the world I just wanna back to catching
up to social media site typically go
through my Twitter which is Laura 88 Lee
following it girl and Instagram which is
Laura Orly and I just go through that
and then I'm try to be on those for like
five minutes and it turns out to be like
five hours later and I'm like oh my god
my day it's like done because those on
social media are warning haha such a
horrible habit I need a break
but it's hard I try to comment back to
people and like photos and stuff like
that and be a little bit social please
look at my cat going crazy in the
background but other than that I wake up
and get out of it finally and first
things first I always go to the bathroom
because I drink like a bottle water
every night before I go to bed and then
I will simply brush my teeth to get that
gross morning taste out of my mouth
next I'll just get my massive amount of
baby hairs out of my face and that might
get a little bit of skin care basically
I'm just gonna wash my face just to get
all the dirt off from slipping and then
I'm gonna do a face mask which I love
doing these on the weekends I like to
relax in my bed and do a little face
mask lately my favorite face mask has
been this hydrate mass by pathology this
one is bomb calm and let me tell you why
it adds so much moisture to your skin so
especially in the winter and fall
seasons our skin gets so dry and this
only takes five minutes to add it
moisture to your skin so you just to
apply it like one of those little paper
masks and you rub it on your face to
make sure it's like push well down onto
your skin and then you leave it on for
five minutes it has a vitamin b5 it also
has hyaluronic acid in it so it's so
good for your skin and I will just sit
there for five minutes
typically on my computer and just wear
the mask I have way too much fun wearing
these masks just a heads up pathology is
offering you guys a free sample of one
of these masks if you use the discount
code down below as well as the link to
pathology so check that out it'll be in
the description box so normally I will
sit around on Saturdays and go through
my emails comment back to you guys read
your tweets to me maybe even snapchat
you guys a little bit and then once I'm
done being goofy and all of that I will
remove the mask and instead of washing
your face which will actually do is rub
in all of the product onto your face
which keeps your face super moisturized
so don't wash your face then I'll just
pick out some clothes and get kind of
ready for the day whenever it is the
weekend I like to be a little bit more
relaxed and especially this weekend I'm
gonna work on cleaning my house and
decorating for a full time so right now
I'm gonna work on making that bed which
I make this like two times a week which
is on the weekend
then I'm going to do a little bit of
laundry I hate laundry so much and it
always pops up it's never-ending and
then I have to confess this is my beauty
room this is what it really looks like
after a busy week of working on videos
it is a living nightmare so today I'm
gonna take you guys with me and you're
gonna join me in cleaning my beauty room
this is typically what I do one day of
the week I just go through everything
and really pick up and clean the Beauty
room and make it way more manageable
that way I can get ready for the
upcoming week and all the videos I'm
gonna be filming
okay to be very honest with you guys I
know you haven't seen me eat breakfast
yet and that's because I hate eating
breakfast I am so not a breakfast person
I typically wait till like 11 o'clock
and just go get some lunch drive-through
Diaries much snapchat family members
know what I'm talking about
so typically I've been trying to lay off
the sodas for the first thing in the
morning so I've been trying to drink a
little bit more orange juice or water or
cranberry juice anything but soda so
this morning I'm gonna have a little bit
of orange juice and if I'm extra hungry
I'm gonna go in with a chocolate
pop-tart
oh yeah healthy life so now we're gonna
decorate for fall time which I'm so
excited to do I just love pumpkins and
the Bath and Body Works candles are
which must seem you know I'm obsessed
with them basically to decorate I just
put pumpkins everywhere I'm obsessed of
them I think they're so cute and I get
them at home goods and Target they're
all over the place but um yeah that is
how we decorate for fall
so today I'm gonna be out running it
just a couple of errands I'm gonna put
on the bare minimal makeup basically I'm
just gonna add a little bit of primer to
my skin because this is anti-aging
primer and it's good for your skin and
then I'm just gonna add a little bit of
a tinted moisturizer and this really
isn't for coverage this is more so for
protection of the Sun because it has a
lot of sunscreens in it next I'll fill
in my brows just give my face a little
bit of definition and I'm just gonna be
using this Smashbox a brow pencil I'm
just gonna pencil in nothing crazy going
on here and I'm gonna pop on a little
bit of brow gel is it discussing that
I'm chewing gum right now next I'm gonna
wing it out you guys a love my winged
liner gotta have a winged liner so just
going in with my NYC liquid liner I'm
just gonna make two little winged ease
and yeah wing it out then I'll curl the
lashes add just a couple of coats of
mascara to my upper and lower lashes and
I have a little bit of vaseline on my
lips just to moisturize them I didn't
want to add any tint and that is
literally it I hope you guys enjoyed
