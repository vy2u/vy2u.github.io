video is going to be a little bit
different than my usual videos I
normally never do a video like this ever
the reason I don't is because I
personally don't like to talk about
products that I don't like and the
reason I don't like to do that is
because one if someone loves that
product that I don't like it like hurts
it might hurt their feelings because
whenever people hate on products that I
love I'm like don't talk about that
product like that so just know it all
comes from love I feel like it just
brings this negative vibe on the channel
and I like bad but you know what today
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna talk about
some products has just really didn't
work out for me now that doesn't mean I
didn't like the brand I love all these
brands I'm talking about I truly love
these brands it's just the particular
product didn't work for me I'm gonna
tell you why take no offense and just
now I'm not hating on the brand
I'm just really the product you know
what anyways we're gonna jump right in
and get started be sure to subscribe to
my channel for you leave for more
awesome Chitty chatty chatty Chitty
chatty Chitty that's not that like
titties we're gonna jump right in and
get started the first product I'm going
to talk about was probably the most
hyped up product on YouTube in YouTube
history the Ben Nye banana powder
as soon as Kim Kardashian's makeup
artist at the time admitted that this
was the product he was baking her face
with everybody and their mom went out
and bought it
as did I about this years ago and you
can see that like none of its been used
and that's because whenever I tried
baking my face with it I realized that I
was not Kim Kardashian and that this
yellow color does not work for everybody
and I darn sure didn't work for me skin
is not quite as dark as her so the
yellow didn't cancel out enough and
whenever I took a picture with it it was
literally just like banana I will like a
freaking banana and whatever even when I
came home after the night out wearing it
I look close in the mirror and it was
like cakes of yellow under my eye so I
never touch the stuff again
I used my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and she has never done me
wrong moving right along the next one is
my glam glow now I support glam glow
more than
they probably know like I'm using their
math day-in day-out I talked about my
channel my snapchat my Instagram glim
glowed out however not the product it's
really more so the container this is
actually the mud to foam glam glow face
wash it's 40 bucks so it's a bit cheaper
than the mask and I was really excited
to try it because the super my glam glow
is my favorite mud mask out on the
market so I knew I would love this
especially while I was having breakouts
the problem is the pump is faulty on it
and I thought it was just my pump but I
called someone else who had it it's
their pump too so like the pump doesn't
actually press out product this is me
pressing it as hard as I can and that's
how much product you get literally
normally I have to pump it like seven or
eight times and I have to manually lift
the pump back up cuz it get stuck down
and then I have to beat it so I've had
this for a really long I'm gonna go
ahead and walk that off I've had this
product for a really long time and I
neglect using it because I can't get the
crap to come out pay $40 for a wash can
you please come out so I can use you
next up is this Bobbi Brown gel liner
Bobbi Brown is known as a really
high-end brand and really nice makeup
and I was in the market for a good gel
liner once I found out morphe didn't
have their black gel liner on sell
anymore because that was my go-to liner
so I'm like you know what if I buy a
Bobbi Brown gel liner it's gonna work
good cuz it's Bobby Brown and it's not
cheap boy was I wrong this was the worst
gel liner and as you can see I worked
hard trying to get it to work and I
remember I was going out of town so I'm
like I'll pack my brand new Bobby Brown
liner and I was stuck for like almost an
entire week with this liner having to
use it day in and day out it's
impossible to get a wing liner out of
this because it's just it's not fluid
enough um it's just too cakey in like
two cracky and it didn't look good like
I couldn't like fling out a wing with
this gel liner it's just like pulling
right along to a product I know a lot of
people love and we're going to talk
about it and I'm going to tell you why I
didn't work for me okay
so just hold on just wait before you
comment I adore the shades so much I
think they're great these are too
pigmented
and I love lorac I've used the wrong
before I was on YouTube but the contour
powder I don't like it to be this Pegman
tip because it's very important that you
don't get too much product on your brush
whenever you're trying to contour
because then you take it's just so
unnatural after that like you're psyched
and then you have to try to blend all
that out and it doesn't work out and
time after time I tried these and it was
just way too much product coming off
even when I used a really light hand it
was just almost too powdery and too
pigmented for me so these didn't work
these are the best setting powders ever
so I like 50% of this palette and the
other 50% I didn't lie next up is my
product by NARS and I feel annoying
having to keep saying like I love this
brand because I don't want to spread any
hate or for you guys to get a
misconception on the brand NARS is one
of the best makeup brands on the market
mascara was a no-go this is their
audacious mascara in black moon so
whenever I got this little sample in I
was overjoyed to try it because I love
everything I touch that's created by
NARS including their lip glosses I used
to save my pennies to buy NARS makeup
because it's not cheap but I was highly
disappointed I don't even like these
plastic spoolie brushes but I felt like
it was like too watery and it wouldn't
even coat my lashes you it wouldn't list
them and when it coat them and wouldn't
build them up it really did nothing for
my lashes so this mascara was a total
bust for me next is another product by
Bobbi Brown that is not affordable and
these have been hyped up on YouTube so
much and why can't we stop hyping them
up because you know it doesn't work I'm
not kidding I'm like not happy you
helped this I paid a lot of money for
this at Sephora if I would hold it the
right way that would help this is a
shimmer brick and I know you've heard of
the Bobbi Brown shimmer bricks I bought
this one and I bought it in Sunset pink
which I honestly thought was the
prettiest one and I had dug my brushes
in them and I have tried it's almost
like I'm putting nothing on my cheek
nothing it's intact
I don't know if they're meant to be that
sheer
I would never pay that much money for
something that's this sheer definitely
not worth the money
use it as a blush use as a highlight
whatever it is you're not going to be
able to see it on your face at least not
on my face maybe if it on my skin with a
bit lighter it might work but overall
just just for the price I expect a lot
more
the next product here I go again I love
this brand make it forever is the the
shiz and this bronzer is everybody's
favorite bronzer I feel however for me
and I tried it a lot okay I couldn't get
the bronzer to come out of the package I
don't know if I was too compressed and
they're like the lorac one was too
powdery this one I'm like digging my
brush in it and like you couldn't see
anything on my cheek this one by the way
is number number 20 you know who never
show up on me I couldn't get the bronzer
to come out of the package I was super
super sad about it because it was
everybody's favorite bronzer so I'm like
it's gonna be my favorite bronzer duh
however it's not about let me just put
this way I don't hate this product I I
will you I will continue to use it I'm
not getting rid of it I want to continue
to play with it but it just really
didn't work out for me and so I've been
neglecting it for so long because of
that no I feel like I should just keep
playing with it it may have mentioned
this one before on my channel as a
really big disappoint I had always seen
Mac artists use this I can swear by it
but I want to go clean my brushes with
it and I couldn't be more disappointed I
brush shampoo or works 20 times better
from morphe calm and it's way more
affordable and it whoops this products
but and my spot brush cleaner whoops
this products but this it's just dang
sure ain't worth the money like I would
never buy this again and the only reason
I'm used to telling here is because I
did pay a lot for it so I'm like we got
to use it but it just doesn't get the
product how the brush brushes next
product that was disappointing is this
glam glow here I go again with glam glow
but it's the matte lip treatment so it's
supposed to be a lip plumper I tried
this out three or four times it's
actually super dope packaging look at
that and then you pull it out and you
put on your lips his footstep you know
give you a little plump it did nothing
for my lips which sucked
I didn't return it but anyways I love
the theory of it I love glam glow so
again I was like this is gonna work out
great however I did not work out great
and it did nothing for my lips that's
all have to say I've tried it a
bazillion times and did nothing
please comment down below if you tried
this and it worked for you
please let me know if I'm doing
something wrong tell me your story with
the glam glow um so we can try it out
again anyways that is it per my very
overrated and disappointing product I
hope you guys enjoyed the video if it
wasn't too negative I didn't want it to
be a negative video or like a hateful
video this is a happy place okay be sure
to subscribe to my channel before you
leave and I hope to see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
