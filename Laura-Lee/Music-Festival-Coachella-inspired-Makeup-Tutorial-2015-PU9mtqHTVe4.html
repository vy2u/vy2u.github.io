super fun for any festival or Coachella
if you are attending this year so to
start off we are going to be
moisturizing our skin with this mantener
ab lotion and this has lots of sunscreen
in it most important step when going to
an outdoor event then we're going to be
using our primer water right on top of
that to set our face next we're gonna go
in with this BB cream I don't want to
use full cover so I'm not doing a
foundation and this is like liquid to
powder so it's super lightweight on the
skin
I am totally pretending right now by the
way guys it wasn't recorded whenever I
applied it the first time so this is my
second layer of this BB cream going on
my skin and I'm just pretending like
it's my first - you guys could see me
applying it I know I'm a weirdo then
going in with the NARS concealer we're
literally just gonna add a dab in the
corner of our eyes just to cover up
those dark circles so we look fresh and
awake for our jam sesh at any concert or
festival or fun activity that we're
gonna be attending this summer
then we're gonna bronze at the face no
one wants that pasty pasty face when
attending an outdoor event so I'm gonna
be using the bronze booster by
Physicians Formula this also has
sunscreen in it and then I'm just gonna
add a little bit of powder in the
corners of my eyes to make the makeup a
lab now for the fun part
with who I'm gonna be lining my eye with
these new liners from Smashbox this one
is in shade lilac and I'm just gonna
line the lash line and then I'm gonna
wing it out really thick you honestly
don't have to be that precise with this
part but later we'll get a little bit
more precise I'm just sending it pretty
really well I'm not a pretty but a
really thick wing right here and now I'm
gonna go in with the same liner in black
and I'm not gonna bring it all the way
up to cover all the purple because I
want a little bit of the purple to peek
through so I'm just gonna create another
wing and it looks like we have a double
winged liner and it looks super cool
then we're also gonna line the bottom
water
and we're gonna wing it out as well so
now we have double weeks which was super
easy and then I smudged it out but the
eye is definitely optional it's kind of
dark and I didn't even go in with some
pencil liner by Milani and fill in that
waterline just so everything matches
down below and just to give it a little
bit more of a pop I added some of the
lilac color in between the wings there
then I decided to smooth it out with a
little bit of bronzer to soften it up
and this is the fun part I had so much
fun drawing you stuck my face I don't
know why but I use this NYX white liner
and I just add well polka dots and it
was just fun and I think that school
makeup is supposed to be fun
then I added some mascara I did in a
patting false lashes but I don't
recommend wearing those to a festival or
any hog event because they become become
a hot mess very quickly and then I added
a little bit of shell by Mac highlighter
this is a cream highlighter it's gonna
last a super long time and when the
sunlight hits it you will be like a
glowing goddess it is still pretty on
the cheekbone and just a little bit down
the nose as far as lips go I decided to
add a ma B pink color and then I want it
to lighten it up so I added a nude right
on top of that so we ended up with a
light multi pink color and no festival
look is complete without any type of
headpiece I like the gold chain as well
as my flower headband so what do you
guys think I hope you enjoyed it give it
a thumbs up if you did and be sure to
