video it's going to be on they're
different because I'm sitting on the
couch ain't got no makeup on my hair is
in it's a usual crap you going I would
say messy button but this is just a
crappy bun today I brought with hop
skincare with you guys and you know
we're not talking makeup so I wear no
makeup brush face you're probably
wondering where's her opera house ain't
got none here we're gonna stop seeing
Kerr and my whole skincare routine has
changed 110% and I was kind of about my
skin harrassing I didn't really know
like what I wanted to use because I work
for dermatologists for four years and I
quit like a year ago because I moved but
the medical assistant program ecologist
so I know all kinds of juicy info about
just eh your largest organ I am back to
using products that I use when I worked
at the dermatologist and I feel like I'm
gonna explain these products to you and
why I use them and what they can do for
your skin rather than just tell you what
I'm putting on my face you can buy them
on premiere look calm which is so cool
because that'll buy them out of the
office at the dermatologist they also
sell the stuff that I used when I worked
at the dermatologist so it's like don't
mind if I do
if you're interested in learning a
little bit of the derm life and
anti-aging and skin transformation well
then please just watch
after I've gotten finished washing my
face I like to Pat my face dry that way
it's not pulling on my skin it's just a
really gentle way of getting the water
off of this kid the first thing that I
like to do is go in with my skin medica
retinol complex and this is just retin-a
it's a retinol Tretton Owen and it's a
derivative of vitamin A this is super
duper anti-aging but it's so much more
than that this this turns over your cell
times faster this is a miracle drug and
they do sell in different strengths I've
used pretty much the weakest strength
because my skin is so dry if your dry
skin you cannot go in with the strongest
strength in this stuff you have to start
with a weak Street and I recommend using
it only every other day because this is
a powerful little baby right here
there's a trick with it you have to be
consistent you cannot use this once a
month you can't use it once a week and
expect it to do anything for you because
you will be disappointed every time
you've got to start every other day very
consistent with that and then your skin
will build a tolerance to it and you'll
be able to go to every single thing is
that stuff that I use for four years
straight when working at the
dermatologist
next we'll talk about product and this
is vitamin C serum so this is pure
vitamin C this is oh by Obagi it comes
in a little dropper and what I like to
do is drop a little bit on the back side
of my hand and I like to evenly coat
this all over my skin and whatever is
left on my hands I like to rub my hands
together and that way the serum also
coats the back sides my hand and we'll
go into talking as to why I do these
things to myself this prevents skin so
damage this is saving your skin this
super anti-aging lighten and brighten
your skin's home I love this stuff it
firms your skin it protects your skin is
anti-aging it boosts collagen in your
skin and it light number and your skin's
so this is a lot G professional C serum
10% so the next moment talk about is my
eye cream what I like to do with this is
exact just a tiny bit on both fingers
and lightly Pat this all over my under
eye area and then I bring it up and
around onto my eyelids and I just coat
the whole eye area this is just super
moisturizing and this just helps me
prevent that dry gross under eye area
and also my under eyes are so moisturize
in the morning that my eye concealer
doesn't seem to crack as often since
I've gone back to using this this is to
target and firm your under eye area it
also helps with anti aging and also
firms out those wrinkles those crow's
feet and the best thing of all my main
issue is them dark circles this will
tackle dark circles like nobody's
business I will talk about these poor
eyebrows I know you guys can't even see
them but they're there I have a few
eyebrow hair so I'm trying out a new
product this is the revita brow and this
is a brow conditioner and it's supposed
to help your eyebrows grow and to be
darker and to be thicker and Lord knows
that is what I meet in my life in Jesus
so the only thing that I have to do here
with the revived brows I just pop it out
and it comes on a doe foot applicator
and you just swipe and swipe it across
your eyebrow and you're done and I do
use this every single night you got to
be consistent or it's not going to do
anything for you consistency is key this
is something that we said all the time
at the drama people be consistent if you
want results so that's what I heard I
love all these products I knew all about
them forever and I'm just here finally
filming a video telling you guys about I
didn't get all these products like I
said at the darm because I can turn it
off or there anymore and I can't fly all
the way back to help me
