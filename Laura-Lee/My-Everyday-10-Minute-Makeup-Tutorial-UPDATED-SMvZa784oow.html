today's video is going to be really
quick really easy everyday makeup this
is my updated make it routine this is
what I've literally been doing non-stop
lately my life has been so absolutely
crazy that this is like my go-to makeup
like literally what I'm doing I need to
look polished and pretty and put
together but girl I ain't got time for
the glitter cut crease I've been living
in that at the house I've been doing
this routine it's so easy and I've been
loving it and it wears very well
throughout the day also there are a
couple of portable products I'll be
throwing in this video this is much
requested I try to do an update at one
at least once a year because the
products and the routine does change a
little bit but it is pretty simple
neutral makeup that I'll be doing in
this video also in this video I am so
excited because Clinique is partnering
with us thank you Clinic I'm really
excited about the product and partnering
with us on this product I've used
numerous times in my Instagram as well
as my youtube channel and is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
plus concealer so this is a foundation
full coverage wears so well throughout
the day and it also has this big fat
applicator which makes it so easy to
apply like I love it it's truly
something I count on this is my personal
bottle of it as you can see I've used it
a lot and I am shade eight and golden
and neutral this is the perfect shade
for me really been enjoying that
foundation so if you need to try and
shoot full coverage foundation golf
that's where it's at anyways I'm gonna
be using that in today's video but
without further ado we're gonna go ahead
and say the SUBSCRIBE song let's follow
along shall we be sure and subscribe to
my channel yeah now let's go ahead and
jump right into the video cuz girl we
gots to go
I have a husband upstairs playing video
games yelling and I have a cat over here
bored playing with her cat toys so
hopefully this video will be somewhat
silent okay this is for realsies no joke
when neutral Tim and a makeup tutorial
like it's something to go to you can
follow this step by step you can add
parts with lead parts off de pon
depending on what you and your needs are
and what you like on your face but I
hope this helps you out first I like to
always start out with a facial primer if
you're not starting out with a primer
maybe it moisturizer will be nice I've
been liking this touch of the silk
canvas it makes the skin so smooth it
helps fill in the pores so I just take a
little swig of that on my finger I
should have said a swish not a swig
we're not drinking here hello rub that
in this feels so good alright so now I
immediately move into foundation and
again today we'll be using the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation A+
concealer in shade number eight now they
have 27 different shades so you're bound
to find your shade in this one and I
like this because it's full coverage but
it's not very heavy or cakey filling on
the face so it's extra great for wearing
all day long if you go to any clinic
location you can receive a 10-day free
supply of this to really test it out and
like I said they have 27th shade so
you're bound by your shade in it next
I'm gonna go in with my y6 brush from
morphe and I like to stipple this
product out you guys can really see that
coverage
and as you guys can see this has really
rich pigment in it and it blends out so
easy X I will go ahead and set the
makeup that's really important to me I
love setting my foundation today I'm
gonna go ahead and set the under eye
with the k'kaw Beauty baked and shade
number two I'm back and with a sponge
I'm just gonna set just the under eye
cuz girl we're on the go and then I'll
take a very light later layer layer of
this powder and just go ahead and set
everywhere else but just like a tiny bit
of powder and that way we're locked in
place all day long and we look really
busy and flawless once that's all done
I've been loving these little morphe duo
set here you go right there
like to use this for my bronzer contour
and I take our art 14 brush and honestly
instead of really contouring I like to
just buff this around and warm up the
skin and not get too crazy because again
whenever I'm literally trying to do 10
minute makeup I'm not trying to sculpt
and define my face I'm literally just
trying to add some bronzer and a little
of this goes a very long way and as you
can see our already look full coverage
beat with a little bit of bronzer on and
then I like to take this you okay kit
which is called glitterati and I really
like the sparkly shine for my
highlighter so our 36 brush and even a
girl on the go you can skip this part
you want to but I just like this
highlighter is moving on to eyebrows a
trick I like to do girl I can do my
eyebrows in like two minutes that I like
to do or did in the past I always
practice my eyebrows and winged liner
before I got in the shower that way I'll
wash it right off whenever it went south
you know what I mean and I highly
suggest you guys do that if your if it
takes you guys a really long time you're
still trying to perfect it do it before
you wash your face and then that way
even if you messed that it won't matter
and you'll save yourself time in the
morning once you really got it
it'll take you like a couple minutes
just like it takes me now cuz I've been
doing it for so long people always come
in these videos how do you do winged
liner and brows and all that in ten
minutes and I'm like it really only
takes me ten minutes I'm talking to you
now so then take me a little longer but
it really only takes me ten minutes
because I've been practicing and I've
done it for so long so just practice
makes perfect and why not there's a brow
actually just like to go ahead and rub
some concealer on my eyelids as a primer
I'll go ahead and set them with that Kim
K powder any what I like to do is
actually just going with bronzer and
I'll just buff a little bit in the
crease and I'll take the glitterati side
and take the highlighter on my finger
and literally just pop it on my eyelid
it's so easy just um boom baby typically
always go for a matte in the crease and
a shimmer on the lid whenever I'm really
in a hurry if you want to do Matt and
Matt or kind of make it your own feel
free to do so this is just typically
what I go for in feel like always looks
good and I can like count on to look
good
take em 250 brush and a little bit of
black gel liner and just wing it out
because honey when in doubt we wing it
out
I'll take from this extra-long lash
mascara from Rimmel and just apply it to
my upper and lower lashes darling it's
gonna add a little bit of that highlight
shade to my inner corners as well as my
brow bone you can skip this part it is
not mandatory one of my last steps is my
lip so I like to line in this issue ways
lipliner and Sienna and then I'll add a
little bit of Juiz a buff into the
center of my lips and lastly I'll just
add a little bit of mist I've been
liking this one or beauty it glow getter
mess I'm just gonna spritz it on and
wallah we are done honey
this is our final look I think it looks
really well put together it looks like I
tried oh ah so I added some lashes cuz
you guys know I am addicted to lashes ok
open and literally what I'd normally do
whenever I'm really low on time as I
will grab a pair of lashes that I've
already used before that way they're
already trimmed and shaped to my eye
looks like and Lily slap on a little
piece of glue and go right on to my eye
it literally takes me less time to add
the lashes than it does for me to build
up my natural lashes and curl them and
all that like girl I hope you guys liked
it I hope it helps you out with your
routine at home I think the foundation
and concealer look as well as the
highlighter and everything else honey
looks like I tried really hard and took
forever on my makeup but really I didn't
and just makeup I promise you will last
literally all day so thank you again for
