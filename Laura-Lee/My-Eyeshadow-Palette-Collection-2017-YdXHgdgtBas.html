today that's all hey guys welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be me
going through my eyeshadow palette
collection this was much requested but
alongside of my home tire makeup
question was requested but I think I'm
going to do it like in segments and not
the whole thing in one so we don't have
an hour-long video here it's more like
hopefully like a 20 minute video I'm
going to give the intro really short
because girl we already know this videos
going so we'll jump right in and get
started be sure to subscribe to my
channel before you leave this video and
be sure to grab your grandma your mom
your dad your cat your dog and we'll
popcorn and enjoy the video let's go
alright guys here is the first drawers
once you know there's four drawers um
hello focus there are four drawers of
palette - all new kind of quickly
through them and I just wanna let you
know my drugstore palettes are in a
separate compartment in my closet and
they're organized in fact so jumping
right man getting started this back row
here is my Too Faced collection we have
chocolate bars peach and then like the
little heart love palette and then back
here is my Urban Decay family ever decay
like the one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten you get the point
and if you open this one up here this is
my one my first pie in palaces a palette
is probably expired and I don't use it
anymore I just keep it because I really
started my channel of this palette I won
my first high-end palettes that I ever
owned besides buying single Mac
eyeshadows she's been through it was me
she's been through many jobs many life
changes with me and this is when the
palette first came out I bought this one
so it's like a new palette are not new a
super old palette in know it's like a
keepsake I always tell boys like if they
don't understand makeup and like thing
about baseball cards and things that men
collide and girls collect makeup it's a
collector's item moving on I have all my
own especially Beverly Hills college
right here we have some oldies some of
their first I should have palettes the
lavish palette I don't know if you guys
remember something like this that came
out with them but it's another oldie
that I just keep on deck because yo I
can't get rid of the little trophies
that I've collected throughout the years
mind you before going in this video
majority of I make it was sent to me in
PR I do not buy
with this makeup than hell if it wasn't
to me I probably would buy most of it
anyways because I'm very I think this
was our presences on Sasha Beverly Hills
a further eyeshadow palette this is the
catwalk palette and I remember buying
this and just so stoked about it and I
used it a lot back in the day she is so
old she's antique don't look at her to
March my bust into dust
whoo so anything a BH is right back here
and then we'll move on to this whole
stash I got right here these are a
couple of newer pallets except for the
Tarleton bloom palette my friend Donna
came out the persona palette lorac came
out with this cute little guy right here
and it's got some really interesting
shades in it and it kind of inspires me
so I want to play with that I haven't
played with it yet and our reason it
sounds a little tutu tutorial that I'll
link down below with this new NARS
loaded palette this is such a great
eyeshadow palette it's very pretty and
over here I have some friends from
morphe I love these little palettes I
think they are definitely worth your
dollar as my voice is going in and out
as I'm turning my head this is not a
chocolatey out of here Oh mine is but
anyway there's like many I show pals
from morphe I think you're $12.99 and
then you get the discount code as well
so they are so pretty that's actually my
favorites the 12 in B oh I mean this is
like the travel palette it's just got
every color and edition ate honey and
then finally these guys right here my
favorite one that went out of stock
first of course I believe will said 25 a
deep palette I recommended this one to
you guys these guys are just everything
and I really love the clear packaging
better than the black packaging because
you can see what you get now we'll start
on this little hunk right here this is
the Queen of Hearts palette I think it's
coming back in stock soon its bicolor
reign awesome palette then my baby a
double already these artists who I show
pellets first we have beauty killer
super sick eyes shadow palette loves it
and I want to use this more like I'm
looking at a palette dama need to use
this more and then we have undrajavaram
barrage it the colors are so creative
and so inspiring to do something fun
this how it sold out by discolor sis the
ice cream eye cream palette and we have
some Smashbox and lorac palette and then
new from DISA color are these eye
shadows there's like a cool film or tone
palette and they're actually some of the
creamiest I chose of life and I'm super
impressed with them and I plan on
playing with them way more this is a ma
b1 I'm a sucker for a good mommy color
as well so it's so pretty I comes with
kilo brushes get in there get in there
forget it all right Yoshi has joined us
she's circling around the drawer so be
here toenails you know what time it is
this sure is of course randomness but
this first section is palette that I
kind of created myself these are all
makers gig eyeshadows and I just put a
look of Z palette matches I heard there
was tea on Z palette being rude to
people in their Instagram page I don't
know honest I didn't get the full scoop
and I don't mean to be mentioning dis
unless I know the whole entire story
because I don't but someone will
enlighten me in the comment section I'm
sure anyways here are more eye shadows I
think yeah these are all make it beats
new yep these are the new ones for
makeup geek so I just popped the new
ones in here and then this is my Sephora
old-school make it the eyeshadow palette
that I traveled with forever and a day
these I dreamers are so old and then
this eyeshadow palette the reason
they're missing that hosen is because I
did recently a lot of traveling and I'll
show you these are all on a special
Beverly Hills by the way but I did
traveling and I created like my own
little travel palette and this is
typically things that I do whenever I
travel upgrades like my own little
moment just so I can carry a little one
in my luggage with me and then we're
going to jump into glitters which is
always so excited anyway I remember when
I did the full-size glitter challenge
these came in handy so who knew
eyeshadow palette also smells so strong
though those are by glitter injections
but pinky rose cosmetic came out with
these glitter palettes right here I
think again no more we need to take one
I thought I gave one to Manny anyways
these do not swatch well at all but if
you pass them they are everything that
you could dream of so you just have to
apply them like an S motion don't do
anything like this
there's tricky to work with but once you
get it down they're absolutely amazing
this is the same brand pinky rose such a
cool palette and then this is the hero
Civ actual or I shoulda palette i swash
this a little and they felt nice but I
haven't played with them on my eyelids
yet they may be super cool I'm just not
going to give a definite answer on that
right now so I don't know they swatch
super nice and you get a lot of color
okay so these are being morphe palette
and I think I'm going to redo all my Z
palettes and get rid of them and by all
morphe fake palettes that happy palette
for selmak site and they like double the
freaking size and they're affordable so
right here are my morphe single
eyeshadows and then right here by big
morphe pressed pigment that one is a
makeup geek or actually it make it
forever and then these are XS on social
issues yes I have another one and they
are all color pop honey color pop
recently wants their single eyeshadows
and I just come in a big morphe palette
next are some of my Mac palettes that I
created myself I have a load of Mac
single eyeshadows I need to fill these
palettes up with but this one is
probably five years old and then this
one's probably five years old - and then
this one Mac sent to me it was already
pre-made but super pretty
next I won't go through all these so
these are my morphe palette this little
one is the Jacqueline no one but I will
show you the most recent one that just
launched in case you okay that's the 35
oh it's crazy to it like I can just look
at this palette and I can tell you
exactly what it is this is a 35-hour
palette and it is and Bree I'm going to
be honest with you this one almost beats
the 3500 almost like it's better just
because I mean it's very small time but
it's still just colors that I use every
single day and I like how the palette is
organized and they have two sons right
here shimmers matte the whole works it's
a dream I should have held honestly I
hope it's still in stock by the time
this video goes live next over here it's
just like a random stash I have a couple
youtubers palette there's Kathleen with
morphe Carli bybel BH tart and graveyard
girl a Lancome lunatick cosmetic and in
the Marc Jacob holiday palette let me to
say these fingernails have been through
hell and high water and I'm giving them
a rest this one they're bare today okay
guys this is my mini eyeshadow palette
drawer where the smaller palette goes to
die I'm skinning
these are the two phase and mini
palettes this is one of my favorite ones
that have all many many moons ago the
summer eye palette they don't sell
anymore but I'm showing it to you just
to make you angry because
I don't know I bought a lot of these
from old money and now I get them sent
to me which is super exciting a special
this is the newest one the honey peanut
butter and honey palette the emma has
been actually gotten a big fight if it
was called honey or peanut butter and
honey he was right I was wrong and then
I have just some more smaller pallets

forever
we got lot lorac and then this little
tart teeth palette which actually put
this one is like the cutest cool thing
that I just take you these right here
are all the Smashbox little mini
palettes I did many tutorials on
instagram with these a girl then came
out with so many of these they did not
play Smashbox well if you didn't get to
see the inside of these this is what it
looks like pretty and then we had some
of my favorite little things and more be
ever came out with and I travelled with
these a lot these little mini ice tray

pigmentation so the little pallets I
love anything little I just think it's
the cutest we have a mini gnar's palette

hot long summer palette back here I have
