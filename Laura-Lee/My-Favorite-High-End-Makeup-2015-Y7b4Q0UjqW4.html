backgrounds looking a little bit better
we're getting there it's not finished
yet but it's better than what it was
right I feel like we have this common
ground where you guys know that I'm a
very loud like person and like you know
I gotta have a crazy background to flow
with me face video basically I just have
a lot of great products that I need to
talk about with you guys so I figured
out why uh well they're all high-end so
let's just do it fresh and new high-end
favorites I'm gonna share with you and
let you know what is good and what is
worth spending your precious pennies on
we're not gonna buy app we're gonna jump
right in we're gonna talk about amazing
high-end products that you just might
need in your life starting out where
will I begin okay I'll begin with facial
primer the new makeup forever step one
skin equalizer I think this is the
number two one it's called the smoothing
primer this is a silicone based primer
and I know a lot of times whenever you
get into those silicone based primers
they can and they can be a little bit
greasy but and like heavy on the skinny
you can just feel them and it's just so
much makeup love I feel yeah but I feel
like the makeup forever ones are one of
the lightest weight silicone based
primers if that makes sense
because I know they're just it's a lot
of makeup a primer foundation and powder
concealer bronzer all over your face
it's just like oh like this is a lighter
one and it does a really good job of
smoothing out the skin for that flawless
finish
we'll talk foundation I want to do a
like top 5 high-end foundations because
I have a lot of high-end foundations
that I like like a whole lot but one
that is like a WoW one thing I like a
whole lot is the Dior skin nude and
funny little story is my mother-in-law
came by and I did her makeup or and I
put this on her and she was just like
what foundation was that
okay it wasn't like that because only I
talk like that but it she was really
excited about the foundation because her
skin was just like smooth clear
beautiful flawless any great word her
skin was looking good we immediately of
course went to Sephora and got her one I
am in shade at 30 this is just this
isn't there there err nude like this
isn't the really thin one this is like
the actual real deal foundation any time
I going out at night I just tend to grab
this foundation it's a pretty full
coverage foundation but it doesn't get
greasy and the lasting this is just the
next facial product I want to talk to is
a new one by Tarte this is their Tarte
guards 30 this is the sunscreen along
the time when I don't have on any makeup
and I do go out with like no foundation
no BB cream nothing on face I've been
putting this on my face because I worked
for dermatologists I got to see the ugly
side of actually having skin cancer cut
out of your face the Sun is in the
double-edged sword yes it gives us
vitamin D yes it feels good on our skin
yes we get that glow and that gorgeous
bronze tan from it but um there's a back
side to all that this is a really good
one I don't feel like my face is greasy
sunscreen does make me break out um and
like humongous massive nodules it's like
any time I go to the beach and cut my
face in sunscreen I can guarantee the
next day I'm gonna have is it probably
right about there except I haven't been
breaking out using it so I thought I
would recommend it to you guys next
patient product I'm gonna mention to you
guys it's really expensive well to me
it's really expensive this is the NARS
totty totty bronzer Laguna it's like I
it's so perfect
the color of it is so bronze it has
absolutely no orange tint in it
I hate whenever you put a bronzer on
your face and you're starting to let
little orange it's just like why the
thing I like a whole lot about this one
is it comes with a little bitty baby
eita Ida Ida brush and it is a little
bit awkward to hold because they handle
short on my brush is really good and
chiseling out I have this
they're on today and it's just the love
of my life currently I think it was $65
which I really hate it chopping them up
for a bronzer but when I saw the
beautiful big fat NARS packaging and all
I was like oh so I bought it
we're not done talking about the face I
know you're like so many face products
good longer next one is The Naked Skin
Ultra Definition powder foundation so
I've really been enjoying this powder
foundation I got the shade medium this
is a very soft soft soft creamy powder
foundation I never recommend setting
your foundation with a powder foundation
but like whenever I put just some
sunscreen on my skin very like baby
cream I will set it with the powder
foundation but I don't typically use
this with my foundation because it just
gets into too much makeup I normally we
use a mineral powder with my foundation
I like this because it feels a really
light weight on the skin it doesn't cake
up and it just sets everything really
we'll urban decay is really good about
coming out with a lot of different color
schemes for people so that way give a
pink undertone a yellow undertone
whatever you're working with urban decay
tries to work that out and have that for
you but I've really been enjoying their
powder foundation and can we talk
packaging okay okay first of all I'm a
pusher Beverly Hills are coming out with
new highlighters and they look like the
most beautiful thing that I've ever seen
in my entire life I don't have them but
whenever I do we will talk about them a
new highlighter that has come into my
life thank God she way if I apologize
for saying this wrong in another video I
call it you war but we all have that
common ground on this channel where I
like to say things however they just
come out this is your highlighter it
looks really intimidating and white
whenever you see it in the packaging but
once you get it smoothed out on your
skin it is just Oh first of all it's
like pure silk but second of all this
gives you the glow yes of glows and you
guys know I am all about it it's called
Camela and a little bit goes a very long
way I love this little book right here
so I def
how to share it with you guys now we'll
move on well one more really quick face
item I've been loving using this to set
my concealer but it will pick up a flash
like and the underneath I like if you
take a flash you're gonna have that
white underneath I with this stuff this
is the England High Definition
luminizing loose powder and this is
number 43 I believe it's just a yellow
powder and I like to cook with this sets
the concealer so beautifully and I
thought I would share with you guys in
Glock 43 luminizing loose powder now
we'll move on to the hey came out with
these I think they're called mood stone
eyeshadows and they are just so
beautiful colors of them are very loud I
will let you know that and they're very
glittery and sparkly so if you don't
like that I don't know that you're gonna
like these but the pigmentation is just
like there's so much Sparkle and glitter
and beauty and these definitely see a
tutorial involving these but I have been
rocking these lately I did an Instagram
picture wearing one and yeah it was just
good mascaras I have just been reaching
for this mascara constantly so again we
gotta talk about this it cosmetics hello
lashes mascara I have never had a
mascara coat my bottom lashes thicker
and spread them apart at the same time
it's really hard to find that mascara
that adds that volume but yeah it
doesn't clump them together and I think
I have found the one this is the hello
lashes first of all a little top of its
like love that and then it has this ball
on the end which I don't act I'm not
obsessed with the ball in the end but
you only get three rows of brushes it's
like one of this hard plastic ones but
my god it like just grabs the crap out
of your lashes like
lifts them lovely lovely mascara so if
you're in the market for a new high-end
mascara you're in a funk with your old
one check out the it cosmetics hello
lashes next pour an gel eyeliner the
it's just something I grab for all the
time it's the Inglot number 77 black gel
liner you can't get this stuff off I use
the I code mascara removing lines if you
watched my favorites video I told you
that story
besides not being able to get it off
this is me I kind of sort of loved about
it at the same time it's like a
double-edged sword you can't get it off
when you wanted it off but my god
whenever you need to stay in place it's
gonna be there honey it ain't leavin Too
Faced melted lippies I've been loving me
since the day they came out I do have
the new foiled metallicky ones that I
haven't got to play with yet totally
gonna play with them like this week my
life is just been crazy excited too but
I'm gonna go in and share with you ones
that I've had and that I love like a
whole lot so the first one is a melted
coral I knew I loved some color on my
lips and I liked the formula of these
because they don't come off too shiny
like you're wearing a gloss but they're
not as drying like a matte lipstick or a
liquid lipstick so it's that perfect
in-between with the melted lippies but
again the melted coral is a bomb calm
and then my two neutral colors that I
like a lot is the melted nude and melted
peony I actually top whenever I do a
nude lip and it's just too nude I like
to just grab the melts at peony and top
it with it because it adds a little bit
of color a little bit of pink but then
whenever I'm having that day where I'm
just like girl we go in new today I just
grabbed the melted nude these things are
awesome they're not the most
long-lasting thing in the world because
again they're not a liquid lipstick
they're not just gonna like stick onto
your lips all day long they do their job
they add color they don't dry it out I
mean they're a good lippy that is it for
my favorite for my favorites hey my
high-end favorites I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did give me a
thumbs up and check the down bar for my
social media because I would love to be
your friend but with my beauty we're all
that we get just be best friends forever
anyways I love you guys and I hope to
see you my next video
