video is going to be about high-end
products and I think they're worth the
money I know it can be really tricky out
there it is for me because I hate
spending my money on high-end products
the people hype up and then you get in
your site oh no I'm gonna let you guys
in on some high-end products that are
just absolutely fabulous don't talk
about these products a lot because I
just did my 2014 favorites and a lot of
high-end products were mentioned in that
video so I try to keep these items to
things that I use on the squad that I
don't use that much my videos but I
truly love so much and yeah we're just
gonna jump in so if you want to know
products that are worth the splurge
we're spending your money on well then
please just keep watching going to show
this video I'm talking about two pallets
that I think are well worth the hype Too
Faced chocolate bar palette snow I got
tons of questions on my thoughts on the
second one I think the second one's
quality is just as good as the first one
I think the colors are just as pigmented
except for I had a little bit of trouble
with this a pink sugar color it was a
really thick grain sugar it was a really
thick grained a sparkly color and it
didn't show up as well as I wanted it to
the actual palette was awesome it was
just as awesome as the first one now if
you guys are on the Finch or like which
one should I get I don't have either oh
I recommend this first one all the way
it has so many beautiful neutral colors
and it has a lot of colors in this
palette that are like look just like Mac
eye shadow color there's like a lot of
colors that um just remind me a man not
only neutral colors but you get a purple
a maroon a greenish color in here too a
sparkling one and a pink and then you
get a ton of shimmery and matte color
this is just an amazing palette like
everything about it is so amazing and
there's a bonus second one is just as
great I don't think it is quite edge
user friendly just because you have such
a deeper darker colors and then you
like this glitter color you got a bright
blue I just don't think it says user
friendly when comparing it to the first
one so if you don't have either go for
getting the first one if you don't have
this one mol then just just get this one
you you'll need it eventually moving
right along I'm going to talk about a
newer product for me this is it
cosmetics ombre bronzer so this is
basically a darker medium bronzer and a
highlight color this highlight color
reminds me so much of opal it's not even
funny
opal it's by Becca cosmetics for those
of you don't know you didn't pick this
of it also but this is their CC radiance
ombre bronzer and this is the warm
radiance one the brown color is just
such a great deep bronze color it has a
no orange undertone in it so you won't
be looking funky and orange and then
this um highlight is bomb calm like you
will look at it from all the way back
here I will let you know that the
bronzers are shimmery so if you aren't a
purse shimmery bronzer you probably
won't like this palette but I'm up for
anything eyes and I'm obsessed with this
little palette I mention a foundation to
you guys and I just started trying out
this foundation like two months ago
maybe this is the Deewar I'm not going
to sell these words that I cannot
pronounce but this is the Dior nude skin
your skin new foundation I am a color
zero three zero this is a beautiful
foundation it looks like skin whenever
you put it all over your face it's just
so natural and lightweight filling the
coverage is crazy good on it it's 50
bucks at Sephora so it's not out of this
world pricing because I know a lot of
high-end foundations are like 40 so for
New York that's not crazy she's just not
having it checked it has sunscreen in it
you guys know I love that about it it
has a wonderful pump which is sanitary
and easy to use love that about it and
it is so super buildable so if you want
to wear it out for a nighttime look and
have lots and lots of it on it builds up
really well on your skin or if you just
want to wear this as an everyday daytime
foundation which me personally that's
what I've been wearing it for a meze X
is an oldie but a goodie this is my Ben
Nye luxury powder and abundant haul this
basically got bonanza what we go back
banana
famous whenever Kim Kardashian's makeup
artist claimed that he was using this to
cook on her face if you're not um really
knowledgeable in what cooking is is
basically setting how much a real long
time that way you think it's warm to
understand cook the powder into your
fake knit basic mixing it's like a
liquidy substance because now you're
sowing time to fit out it luxury powder
in banana was just like the number one
thing on the market especially for girls
with all of a skin tone to have a
pinkier tone one if you have a liner
pink undertone in your skin but
basically I love this stuff for setting
my concealer and I do like to leave it
on my face for a long time and let it
cook into my skin and then buffer the
excess away I find that you do in it
with a beautiful flawless finish however
whenever I am pale as in like right now
and I put this on my skin I noticed the
yellow undertone definitely have to wait
till summer time or time a little bit
more bronzing to be able to use this
stuff that's why I'm psyched off using
it lately but it is so amazing and I
just wanna let you guys know this bottle
like I've used down to here I've had
fairly two years and they sell the stuff
at I'm at like the smaller bottle one
for like five bucks so it's not really
that high end however when this stuff
like first hit the market as like a big
deal I bought it and I pay like $30 for
this soap it as a concealer Mac Pro
Longwear concealer is just a
tried-and-true always going to be a good
concealer to me a lot of people asked is
this like a cracky dry concealer not
even a little bit like this is quite
heavy and not only that it's very
moisturizing um does it really crease up
just because it's just I don't want to
use the word greasy because it is not a
greasy or oily concealer it's just kind
of heavy um and it's not like powdery or
anything like that like this stuff a lot
of people will mix it in with a lotion
and use it as a foundation it's a great
great almost time amazing concealer a
lot of makeup artists use this on their
clients I was using this in the shade NC
20 but I realized I was like I'm Way too
pasty using NC 20 so I skip down to NC
30 which is much better for my skin tone
I like to use this to conceal and to
highlight my face it is amazing I'm
going to talk about some lip products
these have just hit the market these are
the new in Essos
a liquid lives basically they were
vomiting a lot of lime crime and dosa
colours liquid lips they're basically
like the exact same thing except for you
have a much larger assortment of colors
whereas those brands have like five
different colors to choose from the ones
I got is vamp and pure Hollywood both
colors are amazing
von vamp today yeah nothing it is so
cool I love these two very impressed
with them only get two because I wanted
to try them out and I wanted to confirm
that I love them before I bought more so
now I'm going to definitely order more
they are 20 bucks a pop so like these
two little lippies for $40 so therefore
we get two more that's $80 on lip gloss
and I'm like but I think they're worth
20 bucks
I know Macy's is gonna be carrying them
if you're not comfortable with picking
out a color online but from one extreme
to the other because I wanted to see how
the lighter nudie ones worked and then I
wanted to see the formula in the darker
ones but I love them both but if your
lips are really dry I don't recommend
you using any type of liquid stain
whatsoever because it's just gonna make
your lips pill more you don't
necessarily have a problem with dry lips
then go for these little mamas next
we'll talk about this blush from NARS
NARS blushes are amazing I don't really
even think they got popular until all of
a sudden orgasm just blew up and went
crazy and everybody their two-year-old
daughter was using orgasm on their
cheeks I mean it was just wall which
orgasm is one of those Universal colors
it looks good on almost anyone but this
is torrid which is a little bit more of
a pinky peach color than orgasm I have
been super pleased toward is another
popular one but I will let you know in
general NARS flushes they are great they
are pricey but they are wonderful and I
like the size of over my knee just a
little bit of the Tarte Amazon clay
blushes as far as the lasting power and
um I face eats blush blush is one of the
first things to go whenever you're doing
your makeup I don't know why normally
the first thing that you lose your make
this blush so I always add just a little
bit more than I would like to wear out
because by the time I go out it's faded
faded faded faded it's amazing next is
an eyeliner this is English number 77
gel
nine and this one is a pretty popular
gel liner I've seen it around the beauty
community quite a lot and I know why I
have
this Joe miner what in the world this
gel liners lasting power is extreme the
blackness of it is blacker than any
liner I've ever used um the only bad
side with it if you make a mistake on
your wing liner with it you can't get it
off your eyelid you can't lick your
finger real quick or like a q-tip and
get it fixed and you'll definitely have
to go in with some makeup remover and
screw up the stuff off it is just so
powerful but if you're really
comfortable doing gel liner
I do recommend trying to step out is
have a steady hand and a brave heart
when using it what is knucks the next
product a dimension - it's a primer and
it had the mini one because the big size
is like $75 and I wasn't willing to
spend $75 on the facial primer I want to
have a drawer of 20 of them so I brought
the mini one to try out and now I'm like
where's my $75 bottle Wow okay I do love
this hourglass veil mineral primer
lightest primer in the whole entire
world the light lightest weight primer
you will ever put on your skin it is a
great job in smoothing out imperfections
in your scape you're one of these people
have bigger pores and you're able to see
them through your foundation definitely
try priming around try out this veil
mineral primer and you can get this mini
one I can't remember how much I paid for
the mini one it'll be linked down below
um but it definitely helps smooth out
those imperfections it's just amazing
for that well worth the money this is
rude pur Couture number 10 by YSL if set
LeBrons and I've gotten stuff all over
the top of it smells just like the YSL
perfume which is weird whenever you put
it on your mouth because it feels like
you can almost taste perfume and it's
kind of gross but for my dry lip gals
out there hello this is the answer to
all your prayers well - your lipstick
prayers anyways is a beautiful pinky
nude color I love mixing this with my
stripped down
lip pencil by Mac I have dry lips um
that I struggle with quite a bit of this
lipstick I can wear out all night and my
lips only a draw whatsoever if anything
it's moisturizing it is so amazing it
feels so good on the lips the only thing
I don't like about it is like the scent
/ taste like I feel like I accidentally
sprayed their perfume in my mouth when I
use it baby lumination by Girard is
gonna be my
only repeat because this is the Holly I
want to talk about this is just an
amazing highlighter it is a little bit
brycie I've had several people comment
on my videos asking me is it worth some
money and that's why I thought I would
mention it in this video is well worth
the money I love this dub I find that it
blends out on the skin just so nice and
softly and it's quite a strong highlight
though like you're not really gonna get
a subtle highlight with this stuff it's
a pretty powerful highlight I do find
myself using it just about every other
day I caught myself reaching for it it
has lasted me the longest because it
only takes like the teeny tiniest pump
and I've also added it in my foundation
and a couple of toriel's show you guys
then you can like illuminate your whole
face goodgoodgood loominator well worth
the money and you'll have this tube for
like ever
Congrats if you made it to the end of
this video till the skin care under
cover under conditioning okay that's
just too much work it is a Stila toner I
don't know if they still sell this at
Ulta but that's where I got it from and
it was long time ago because this bottle
has lasted me forever because it
literally takes two little dots to cover
my whole face I've been talking about
this stuff for a very long time I love
this toner as I said before especially
this time of year my skin is dry and I
can't use an alcohol-based Homa on my
skin this is a high-end toner I think
it's $29 I love it it feels so good on
my skin I love the smell of it it's the
weirdest so weird to smell like in the
world but I'm weird so I think that's
why I like the smell of it don't wash my
face I applied to doctor this on a
cotton pad and then I wipe my face down
and it just cleans up my face any
imperfections and it evens out the page
balance in your skin it's a great toner
I recommend it for anyone honestly I
want a lot to you that is everything I
want to mention to you guys in this
video I hope you enjoy this video and I
hope it gave you some insight on some
high-end products and yes they are worth
the money
