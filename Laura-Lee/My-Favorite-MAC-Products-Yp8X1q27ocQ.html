video is going to be my favorite mag
products so I wore my Mac's lipstick
shirt I think it's from Etsy my friend
got it for me for my birthday last year
I loved it so much that my favorite
shirt ever as you can imagine Mac
favorite videos you guys requested it
and here it is really quick before this
video gets started I wanted to give a
shout out to a fellow YouTube channel
this refinery29 you guys this YouTube
channel it's so hilarious and amazing
you guys definitely need to check it out
we're finally we're finally come honoree
29 is originally a website and it
covered beauty fashion lifestyle all the
good stuff and they just started up a
YouTube channel and I wanted to show
them some love and tell you guys a
little bit about it they have the most
amazing hilarious entertaining videos
ever and that's the only way I know how
to describe it they they are so funny
the other night means how there's been
forever on their channel watching on
their videos they had one where it was
like a scenario of running into your ex
hilarious and there's a short little
videos super funny I would definitely
love if you guys would take some time
and check out their new YouTube channels
that came out with as well as the
website looks like Bob calm but I'll
leave everything in the description so
be sure to check out the description box
and check out their videos I promise you
they're so entertaining they're
hilarious and they're short so you you
can't just watch one you have to watch
like they have to binge watch on
basically they're hilarious check them
out and you if you guys are interested
in saying all the products I love combo
well then please just keep watching just
an FYI this video was really hard to
create because it was really hard for me
not to pick up every single Mac item
that I have in my makeup collection and
share it with you guys because I love
Mac that much yeah it's it's a whole
nother level whenever we talking that
the first product I want to talk to you
guys about is the Mac prep and prime
this is their natural radiance primer
and
just want to let you guys know that I
have made a huge mistake when talking
about this primer in the past I've
always said that this primer helps with
the longevity of your makeup it does not
and I took when I took that matte class
they're like that's a misconception
primers do not help with longevity the
only thing that helps your makeup lasts
is setting it I was like it told a lot
it helps smooth out your skin and also
adds moisture and preps your skin for
your makeup I do love this product to
set my skin for my makeup and I do feel
like it's super lightweight and I feel
like if you have oily skin or dry skin
it will be good for you this is just an
all-around great primer you get a
massively huge bottle of that when you
buy it one pump is plenty for the whole
entire face and lastly I get out of
breath when I talk very passionately
about products I'm in limbo - I want to
talk about is their foundation now this
is not Studio Fix I haven't won Studio
Fix in probably seven years and I don't
know my shade in Studio Fix I know
people ask me all the time because it is
a reference shade I don't know my shade
bad beauty blogger my shade in the match
master foundation is 3.0 and I love this
foundation because it sets really good
on the skin I don't have a problem with
it being too heavy it has shade matching
technology in it and you guys it is an
amazing technology and you will be able
to tell I put this on my skin and it
doesn't match and by the time I've got
my brows filled in which that does take
a hot minute it's not just so perfectly
to my skin this is the coolest product
ever so if you're one of those people
who has a really hard time finding that
perfect match for your skin tone
go get that match master from Mac yes
girl they will hook you up next I want
to talk about a tried-and-true Holy
Grail product for me and my makeup
collection I just wish they weren't in
glass broth bottles because I've broken
them before very devastating because
they're Pro Longwear concealer and I
find that this concealer is so much more
than just a concealer it has all kinds
of things within this little magic
potion bottle a lot of
we'll make some pump of this in their
foundation and use it as their
foundation because the coverage of it is
crazy good in the past I have use this
as an eye primer I don't personally like
it as my favorite eye primer but I have
use it as an eye primer whenever I
didn't have one on hand whether I was
traveling or who knows what shenanigans
I was getting it and it does work it
does have that technology with it which
helps um your makeup to stick on better
so another great thing about this and
the last thing about it it's a good
concealer it's great for the under eye
area I'm wearing it right now there's a
mama and a baby I'm so weird oh mac fix+
spray ladies and gentlemen if you don't
have it just pause the video put it on
your to watch lighters and go to Mac and
go get this right now talk about helping
with the longevity of your makeup if you
bought one thing from Mac by all means
let it be a bottle of mac fix+ spray I
go through this stuff like water
unfortunately I love the fact that it
picks up any shimmer you have on your
face and it intensifies that and I'm not
talking about Greece and old I am
talking about the highlight the glow on
your eye just picks it up and it will
make you look like it's just like a
makeup enhancer and the last thing that
I like about it the most is the fact
that it sets your makeup really well
next time I talk to you about is there
mineral powders whether it is pressed or
loose personally I have been diggin the
loose one I've had this one for a while
and is quite a little gem that's been
hiding in my makeup George what I like
to do with this is to set my contour or
to contour my face with this a lot of
times I find that whenever I would cream
contour my face like I've done today and
then set it with a bronzer it's just too
much it's just like contours just like
when I use this mineral powder instead
of like a heavy bronzer it's just
setting the contour it's not actually
adding to the contour and I love that so
much about this one by the way mine
isn't medium dark and it just touch
takes a touch of this and yes lipsticks
which is probably the best thing to talk
about in this video because a MAC
lipstick is just like yes you just don't
really
into a really bad mac lipstick however I
did have one that one that we won't get
into that but I'm only gonna recommend
to to you guys today because I could
recommend 50 but I was like let's just
do tool or we're gonna take it down a
notch and we're only gonna do two it's
who I'm going to mention today first is
missing you're probably why is she
mentioned in that white out mist to us
reason I'm mentioning myths to you it's
because you can use it great as your
highlight I'm just kidding you can use
it great as a base for another color a
you either want to lighten the color of
lipstick that you're wearing so you can
mix this in it and it would lighten it
or be your lips are just a really dark
berry color naturally and you want to
wear a light color lipstick but the
lipstick always goes on darker because
of the natural colors up your lips you
can bleep out that color of your lips
with myth I I wear the stuff flown all
the time like I have those whiteout
foreign star lips and they're amazing
the next one I want to mention to you I
think it's just a really really popular
shade in this day and age this is kind
of sexy and I got this at IMATS because
the woman who was helping me was wearing
it and I was like don't even tell me
what's on your lips whatever it is put
it my back
I need it and it was kind of sexy it was
so beautiful on her that Mommy matte lip
right now it was just like boom it is so
popular Thank You Kylie Jenner it's not
so mommy pink it's just more of a ma
being neutral that way you could wear it
every single day of the week and it
would be beautiful with any makeup look
that your beautiful self create your the
next part of Anna mentioned to you guys
I haven't used in a tutorial in a long
time but just know Laura uses this on
her own time often this is show by Mac
and I'm finally showing it to you guys I
mention it all the time on videos but
this is an ultimate cream highlight
whenever I first started using doing
YouTube videos I use this all the time
and people would be like what is on your
cheekbone kind of let opal by Becca
cosmetics run out space on my cheek bone
for the past six months but we're going
to bring it shell by mag back because
this is such a beautiful champagne color
highlight and any time you go to a cream
product versus a powder product it is
gonna last so much longer so again show
by Mac is
cream is the cream highlight and you can
add to your eyelids down your nose
Cupid's bow you can do whatever you want
to with this stuff that's you but
personally me I just like to put it on
the cheekbone area up here and a little
bit down the nose get that glove next
we'll talk about their setting powder
and this little guy right here has had a
long hard life and I'm not even done
with him yet this is my favorite setting
powder I've used boo qoodles of press
setting powders and for some reason I
always go back to my max setting powder
and I like to travel with this one or
always keep it in my purse because I get
greasy
this is so weird but I get greasy right
here and my mouth area probably this all
that Gracie food I eat this is so
awesome because I just put a little
brush in my purse and I'll just kind of
Pat the area to absorb the grease it is
a great job with that but you do have to
be careful with transit powders if
you're going to be taking pictures with
a flash it will pick it up and it can
make you look crazy as far as a blush
one of my tried-and-true blushes from
Mac is warm soul this one their mineral
light blush so they gonna charge you
five extra dollars for it I don't know
why they have to charge more for the
mineralized blush it's like can't a girl
get mineralized without paying that
extra fee this is an awesome neutral
color and I find that warm soul just
warms up the skin it doesn't add that
flush of pink to the skin so here's like
I'm not into wearing pink on my cheeks
just not me I just like to look like a
glowing goddess get warm soul because it
bronzes up the skin it has a hint of
peach but I find that once it gets on
the skin it really turns more of a
bronze and then it does have a little
bit of shimmer it is mineralized in it
so you will get that glow from it all
around great blunts lastly we're going
to talk about some Mac eye shows that
you do need in your life the first one
is my all-time favorite Mac eye show and
I can say this okay it's not going to
come out but I can say this out loud
with pride this is my favorite Mac I
shout out indigestion this is brown
script by Mac I think it's one of the
top warm toned brown colors out there
and I wear this anytime I wear a dark
eyeshadow I normally start out with
brown script by Mac to warm it up that
way doesn't look you have that Panza
black eye it is gradient and you can do
that with warm soul
or a lot of times my go-to makeup look
I'll pop um one mentor my warm soul
everything the second one I want to
recommend to you guys is nylon this is
such a powerful brow bone color and like
I learned in that mat class if you have
a whole lot of brown brown if you have a
whole lot of brow space you don't need I
like like this but if you don't like me
I don't have that much space with my
brow and lashes meet so I am able to
wear nylon and I normally do it this
highlight on my brow bone every day of
the week yes seven days a week next time
I want to mention to you guys is embark
this is a beautiful cool tone brown
color and I find that it's just so
beautiful in the crease and it's matte
and it blends out so soft and it's
amazing it's just so rich and dark and
chocolatey I haven't really found a
color that's quite like embark it's just
so deep and cool and so creamy whenever
you put it on your lid it's awesome
awesome lastly I'm going to mention a
color that I try to mission usually
color speed um if you want to pick out a
color more that you can wear like every
day instead of every once in a while
that I think is great by the way
but lastly I want to mention gleam to
you gleam is a very pretty shimmery
color that's not nearly as powerful as
nylon and I find that this color is so
beautiful on the lid and personally me I
like to soak it in mac fix+ bright on my
brush I spits the brush and then apply
it to my lid I find that it's just like
pow I wore this to IMATS on day two I do
believe on my lid and so many people
were like what is that on your eyelid
again girlfriend and I was like it is
glazed by Mac I have repurchased most of
these products not all of them but I
have you know spent my money on them
twice because they are so amazing and so
great so if you go to Mac you're like
