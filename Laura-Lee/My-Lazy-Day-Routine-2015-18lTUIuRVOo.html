I don't know about you guys but on my
lazy days my number one goal it's this
day my bed as long as possible and that
normally doesn't last too long though
because Yoshi my cat she loves to jump
on mom's head and play but let's be real
I hug her to death
and finally it looks like I'm gonna get
up but I don't actually do much on my
lazy days and actually love magazines as
you guys probably already know about me
I mention it and videos before and no I
actually don't pop down on my couch
I love making a big palette in my floor
and laying on my floor with all my
overpriced throw pillows and I love to
lay on them which probably isn't the
best time in the world but it's just
what I like to do and of course I read
through many magazines and a pillow we
have to have Netflix of course I am
going to be watching some serious
Netflix
just FYI guys magazine is where I get a
lot of inspiration on makeup and fashion
I actually like reading the articles I
don't always know if they're true or not
glamorous probably but more so of a
truth one I love reading the interview
with celebrities and things like that it
should be more of a book reader but I'm
not
and right now my current show is orange
is the new black as we all know the new
suits and just release and I think we
all dance to the same song if you say
you don't dance to the same song you're
lying I have way too much fun for the
things that I think it's awesome the
show is so addicting so I pretty much
binge watch Netflix so hashtags and
watch you know then watch binge watch
huh then I will move on to the beauty
room or my little office area if it's a
lazy day I'm not gonna be editing videos
or filming but doesn't taking time off
doing that I love Pinterest so much I've
been on Pinterest since I was in high
school and I think my user name is Laura
88 Lee as well on that if you want to
follow me on Pinterest I'm nothing
interesting so another thing I like to
do whenever I'm just having a cosy
little lazy day is I love organizing
things which that would be work to some
people but to me it's just relaxing I
love going through everything organized
pretty neat I just got all these
colour-pop lippie thin this is their new
ultra matte lipstick liquid lipstick and
I decide to unbox all of them and
organize them my little drawer the clear
tray is from Target and this is
something that's really fun and relaxing
for me to do on a day off that I don't
have anything else to do as far as my
hair on my lazy day dry shampoo is about
all that I like to do freshen up the
hair cover up the grease and then I
normally just do like a side braid or a
messy bun as far as my makeup goes if
you haven't seen my no makeup makeup
tutorial that's basically my makeup on
any lazy day very natural very simple
almost nothing
alright guys I'm actually going to show
you a few outfit ideas for a lazy day
basically I like to be comfy but not
like homeless so these little shorts are
from forever 21 and my sweatshirt is
from Victoria's Secret something super
cozy not dressy at all but still kind of
cute my next outfit I actually got this
shirt from beautycon which is just a
cute little graphic tank and these are
the most comfortable pants ever I got
them at H&amp;amp;M they were super cheap I call
these my airplane pants because they
look like a parachute but not only that
any time I travel and I had to fly I
always wear these are so comfy and loose
baggy next is probably my favorite
outfit the pants are from forever 21 and
the shirt is from Victoria's Secret I
love the hot pink color and every time I
wear these pants people someone
compliments me I love how they cuff
around the ankle and lastly on any lazy
day either start the lazy day with the
Starbucks run or in the lazy day with
Starbucks run so I'm ending it here and
what do you want an iced coffee Grande a
little bit thank you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
