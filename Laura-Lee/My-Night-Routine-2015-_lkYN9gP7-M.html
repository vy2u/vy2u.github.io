we would end up here shouldn't only
family stop
what is up my YouTube fam Jam this video
is going to be my nighttime routine and
we're going to start it off by walking
into my house as most people do but
anyways once I am home I normally love
all over my fur babies because they
missed me oh so much I'm just kidding
they didn't miss me that much but they
like to pretend that they do because
they want food then I proceeded into the
kitchen because I like to treat myself
with a dr. pepper all day every day it's
my guilty habit and I love dr. pepper
because my favorite drink and now this
video is not sponsored by dr. pepper I
just really loved it and now it is time
to feed my two children so the first one
gets her kitty food and the other one
gets for big girl food they are so
high-maintenance that's where you guys
these cats are out of control but look
how cute that faces next I like to take
off my shoes normally I honestly do this
right whenever I come into the house but
for the video sake I am doing it right
now but just know I don't like to wear
shoes ever I don't even really like to
wear pants or clothes but I'm gonna wear
it for the sake of the video anyways I
upload four to five times a week you
guys know that on this channel so as you
can get a lot of my time it's been on my
computer I am editing I am making
thumbnails I am answering emails I'm
doing things for Instagram it's a lot of
hard work but the payoff is enormous and
I just want to thank you guys for all
your never-ending love and support on my
channel so for dinner I normally do
takeout I know a lot of these videos
people are eating fruit and water but
this girl likes to eat
so I am making taco salad tonight and I
normally just sit on the floor in front
of the TV with hi and we watched The
Cleveland Show almost every night
because we're just obsessed with
American Paint American Dad Family Guy
and The Cleveland Show it's so funny
next I like to deegeu myself as in take
off all the 900 pounds of jewelry that I
like to wear during the day and
I do my bath I'm not always a bath taker
but sometimes I am sometimes I'm a
shower take care of it tonight I think
I'm going to take a bath first I like to
remove any makeup and I do at night mask
two to three times a week I don't always
do them because they can be a little bit
drying on the skin tonight I'm going to
be doing the glam glow super mud mud
mask and this is so hyped up but I
promise you it is worth everything it is
the most amazing mud mask ever I love it
so much and I also like to dance when
it's on my face but it definitely just
works for pores for me it cleans out my
pores and that's the main reason I use
it then my favorite time of the day is
the bath and I like to snapchat in the
bathtub but no nudity is involved I just
love talking to you guys while I'm like
chilling I'm about tubs so weird
probably inappropriate but it happens
follow me on snapchat you guys want to
anyways I have this little pocket carry
full of lush bask little balls and
they're so cute and if I ever do bubbles
in my bathtub Yoshi she's still confused
by them she stays by the bath the whole
entire time trying to play with them
touch them she doesn't understand what
they are and they drive her crazy
so tonight she's gonna be by the bath
now we'll work on skincare first I like
to go in with my moisturizer which is my
belief this is sold at Sephora I believe
I showed this in my morning routine this
is a good morning and nighttime product
for me to hydrate my face tonight I'm
going to be using the this pore cream
from Proactiv I've just started using it
so I don't know like how good it is yet
I'm just trying it out I'm actually
reading on the bottle as I was filming
this and then I'm going with my hope in
a jar I cream I really like this eye
cream but I don't use it every single
night because it can be a little bit too
heavy for me so every other night is
good then I apply a little do for my Bo
wear your deodorant people
so yeah little deodorant next I like to
put a little bit of product in my hair
just to give it texture and I normally
blow dry my hair and then I'll just let
it do whatever I don't really style it
at nighttime I just I just blow-dry it
honestly I just washed my hair bits
lucky and just FYI I jump in the shower
after the bath to wash my hair shave my
legs and get the excess lush bath bomb
off my body the end of my night normally
is me lighting all the candles in my
house like a weirdo but I just love them
well mulch and then I get on my computer
and finish any final edits I have I stay
up til 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning
normally and I like to snapchat you guys
so snapchat me if you want to or do the
Twitter doing the Twitter tweet me oh
and yeah I like be on Instagram there's
my Instagram right there I am all over
social media you guys and I spend lots
of time working on my post as most of
you guys already know but then I hop
into bed with Makita cats and that's
about it for my nighttime routine guys I
hope you enjoyed it please give me a
thumbs up if you did and be sure to
