you
hey guys what I'm home from the
shenanigans of my day the first thing
I'd like to do is kick off the shoes
whichever shoes I am wearing and I am
greeted by a little furry critter at the
door as always and then I like to spend
time playing with her but has she's been
home by herself and she acts so pitiful
because she is the sassy cat I love her
so much you guys she does she eat you
know sweetie
and yeah we play for a while I love
honor
and the other thing
first I'm going to wash my hands and
then I'm going to fix myself to my 50
this is just a detox tea I've been doing
this is a 14 day detox and just
basically get about the bad stuff out
your body and this is just a water
purifier that I have been obsessed with
it's so much better than water bottles
it's so easy to use the 50 is just a
detox is how 2 percent natural your
energy it has antioxidants it's just a
million good things and one little teeny
just strength one a day and normally
warm up the water and then I add the
little tea bag and just because it's
before only taste I like to have lemon
just to give it a little tang in
I normally next spend hours on social
media like to catch up on a couple of
YouTube videos it definitely spent a lot
of time commenting back to you guys and
reading you guys's comments I seriously
love them so much I love reading them
they encouraged me to inspire me on what
video to post next they're just amazing
thank you guys for copying by the way
and I like to sip on my team basically
procrastinate cleaning because every
night I do spend a little bit of time
cleaning tonight it's gonna be tackling
the laundry because it is laundry day
and I have like three more
I told you guys yeah
I used to be a nighttime shower but I
have moved my shower UPS in the morning
time so now I'm just naked cozy and
comfy and I'm also going to throw my
hair up in a ball and touch my head I
always wear my hair like this at
nighttime and of course show you she
follows me around the house everywhere
so I had to pick her up and squeeze her
every now and then show her some more
love and attention first I'm going to be
removing my makeup I love applying
makeup you guys know that but there's no
better feeling in the world than
removing all that makeup off your face
using these Olay facial wipes they're
just so cold and they feel so good
taking off my eyebrows and a facial
makeup then tonight we are going to be
whitening our teeth we're gonna be using
the Dallas market by whitening
lightening and the first thing we want
to do is we're going to dry off our gums
using this little creature swipe be that
it comes with feels really weird on your
route and it's minty then we're going to
go in and we're going to protect our
gums from the whitening serum because it
is a pretty strong serum I just rub this
cotton tip with vitamin E all over my
gums and then I apply the whitening
serum to a little brush so the kit comes
with I apply a lot of serum to the front
of my teeth and just a thin layer on the
back see my favorite part is the blue
light probably cuz I'm a big kid and I
just really love the bright light I
don't know why
we're gonna wait 20 minutes and in the
meantime we're gonna be adding the mask
of Magnum NT by lush image of my
eyebrows is broken out that is the area
that I always break out conveniently
right in the middle of my forehead and
so yeah I just like to let my teeth
whiten let my mask dry and now we are
all finished and we're going to be
brushing our teeth I to use this crest
divot white toothpaste and this helps
maintain whiteness I mean using this
toupees boy the longest and basically
I'm going to wash off the mask now as
far as my face wash I've been loving
this CeraVe foaming facial cleanser it
just cleans off the excess makeup or
anything that's on your skin so well and
just a tip you wanna be sure to rinse
your face at least seven times be sure
to get all the face wash off your face
because that can lead to breakout if you
don't rinse your face really well my
skin care regimen lately has been super
simple I've just been applying this Olay
Regenerist luminous cream all over my
face at night if you have acne or oily
skin I don't recommend using this
because it is an old based moisturizer
and it can lead to further breakouts as
you can see I am skipping the center of
my forehead and then we'll be applying
some eye cream by 100% pure this helps
with the puffiness under my eyes I apply
this cream morning and night in a very
soft pad
then that's about it besides me adding a
little bit of Latisse to my eyes right
before commit but then I normally read a
book and magazine whether it be both
Cosmo people rub some perfume sample and
then I play on my computer and watch TV
for the rest of the night normally um I
do eat dinner just let you guys know
that but I ate right before I came with
some friends so now let me get ready for
bed hopping into bed I normally watch a
little more Netflix and I play on the
iPad and Phil I just can't keep my eyes
open anymore iPad
thank you guys so much for coming to my
channel and watching this video
I really hope you enjoyed I love you
guys so much and good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
