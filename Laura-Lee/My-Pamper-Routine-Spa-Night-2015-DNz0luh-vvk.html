begin by lighting lots of candles
however I like candles like every day of
the week because I have a mild obsession
with them especially Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
new spring candles they smell so amazing
if you haven't tried them go smell him
right now they're awesome
then I like to get super comfy I
normally change into a big t-shirt or my
favorite robe i Betsey Johnson and then
I like to tie my hair up into a big ball
right on top of my head and I normally
add a headband to hold back the massive
amount of baby hairs I have growing out
of my face this way our hair is out of
the way for our skincare routine then I
like to remove majority of my makeup
with the old a fresh effects everything
out wipe these wipes smells so good they
do a pretty good job on removing makeup
too so basically I removed majority of
my facial makeup and attempt to remove
most of my eye makeup then going it with
my black mask this mask is so
awesome and it's so much fun because if
any of you guys have used a pillow
off-map before you already know the
excitement when it comes time to peel it
off but basically I coat my whole entire
face in this mask um and this math is
great for brightening the skin and it
looks kind of crazy once you get it all
on but it is an awesome facial mask and
I get it at Sephora next time for the
bubble bath the essentials are candles
which we already have our magazines
which evoke and people have in my
favorite plate Lee in the actual bubble
bath to create the bubbles I've been
using as the shower gel Maui hibiscus by
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works just in case you guys
didn't know they're shower gels make for
an amazing bubble bath I've been using
them for my bubble bath for a very long
time because they smell so amazing and
they do an awesome job at creating those
bubbles so we have our candles and
magazines in our little scrubby brush
right by the bathtub
and of course we have Yoshi by the way
guys Yoshi loves Bob asked more than me
she is so obsessed with them she is so
curious about the bubble she just does
not understand them so of course she
likes to hang by my aside the entire
time
now it is time to peel off our black
mass I have way too fun like I said
before peeling off a sandbag they're
just hilarious to me and it kind of hurt
though because it was pulling up my
little baby here's my face and it was
hurt and it was painful and how I walked
into the bathroom and his eye Laurie he
looks just like Batman whatever was
hanging halfway off that face it was
hilarious
yeah Batman now we're going to begin our
skincare routine I've been using this
glam glow super mud facial wash this is
super recent product for me but I like
to scrub it in my skin and then rub it
around the skin with the facial brush
this is the elite like skin spa brush
and I have a 70% off discount code which
makes it like 23 bucks it's super
affordable I've been using this brush
for a couple of months now and I love it
I use it three times a week and it makes
the skin super scoff and polish and I
think it's like 23 dollars with a
discount code so it's very affordable
then I like to rinse my skin seven times
being sure to get all of the facial wash
off of my face if you leave them behind
it can create breakout so you want to be
sure to rinse your face very well I'm
going to be drying my face and then
we're gonna go more in depth with the
products that I've been using bonafide
skincare this is the glycolic acid I
don't know if I'm saying that exactly
right but this is an awesome daily
product to use I use this every night I
just put a little bit on a cotton ball
and smooth it out all over my skin this
is great for brightening the skin it is
so awesome for blackheads so if you're
struggling with brought blackheads this
would be a great product for you and
basically I smooth it on my skin with a
cotton ball doing like a sunray motion
going outward on the skin I be sure to
coat my skin really well in it and it is
a little bit drying but once your skin
gets used to it you will be a-okay with
it it is an awesome new product for me
I'm going to rinse this product off
after it sets on my face for a little
bit and Pat my face dry being sure not
to rub next is the little tip or trick I
like to use and using a facial exfoliant
on my hands to its foliot might mean to
make some super soft the one I'm using
here is by natural dermis this is a new
product for me but it is an awesome
product and I like to do this to smooth
out my hands sinking feels so soft and
smooth and of course I'm just going to
risk and dry many then I'll add my
retinol as usual just to pea-sized
amount all over the face and smooth that
out and then we're going to add some
moisture into our skin because both of
those products are very drying so this
is a belief mooster Iser it is so
amazing again you can get this one out
of Sephora and I like to smooth this all
over my face it is just as the perfect
amount of moisture to the skin next I'm
going to go in with my skin medica
under-eye cream
this helps with dark circles and I
actually add a pretty heavy amount of
this right under my eyes because I feel
like for me it helps with the makeup not
creasing now this is another new product
for me but I've been so obsessed with it
I use it like eight times a day this is
first aid beauty hydrating spray and it
just feels so good and cooling on the
skin and I'm going in with my bike
beauty lip moisturizer it's a lip mask
and I'm going to apply this all over my
lips or you can just use Vaseline
whichever works best I normally go back
and forth between that and Vaseline and
now I'm going to be using a but it body
butter from Victoria's Secrets all over
my skin I normally go in with a lotion
but on my paper routine eyes I
definitely use a bottle body butter just
to get some extra moisture especially
after we've been soaking in a hot tub
which can dry out your skin and then I
like to use a little bit of josie maran
argan oil and really massage this into
my knees and my elbows I am in fast mode
taking a little extra time to work this
in oh yeah and I do my hands too now I'm
doing it with perfect hair day this is
by living crews and you can get this
Elsa for it as well I think everything's
from Sephora but you're supposed to use
two to three pumps and that put it all
in your hair and then wash it out in the
morning I use more like six pumps book
of my hair's pretty long and this helps
your hair to be healthy and shiny so if
you're feeling like your hair is kind of
dull definitely try this out I rub it in
my hair tie my hair up in a ball and
there we have it now I like to koplow as
you can see my skin is so greasy and
shiny and I love it so much and then I
play with my computer watch Netflix and
pass out and then then that is our paper
routine thank you guys so much for
