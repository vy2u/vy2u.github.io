she a to start off this video checking
my iPad or cell phone because we all do
that in the beginning of these morning
routine videos but you guys it is the
truth this is exactly what I do when I
wake up every single morning I normally
searched around in my sheets for my cell
phone or my iPad wherever I left it when
I passed out at nighttime and I checked
the social medias definitely follow me
on Instagram and tweet me on Twitter I
would love to have you as a follow
anyways
I normally check my email my Instagram
my Twitter my Facebook and YouTube
comments little things like that and
then I move on with my day
starting off with breakfast my favorite
the Cocoa Krispies
my next step whether it's a weekend
morning or a workday morning I love on
my sweet little Yoshio
and give her my kisses and she's really
distracted right now she sees that big
bowl of cereal and she wants a big bite
but she does have our cat trees early in
the morning and she gets her wet food at
next time then I normally move on to
creating a schedule for myself for this
upcoming week and I write down some
video ideas and then I feel in my
calendar all the ideas that I've come up
with and my permanent schedule for the
week
now it is cleanup time you guys no
judgment please but this is what my
bathroom looks like at the end of every
week I'm not a hoarder it's just a big
mess I'm a beauty blogger give me a
break
so normally on the weekend I like to
clean everything up I straighten up
during the week but on the weekend I
make sure deep clean my home make sure
everything is super tidy for the
upcoming week and by the end of the week
it is trashed again
first I like to shave my lights with
this pure silk this is a shaving cream
for the dollar treat my favorite
favorite Venus razors and I use the new
elite facial scrubber brush and this
thing is so amazing I love it so much
it's only twenty three dollars I'll have
it linked down below but it's my
favorite brush I mentioned it in a video
before and I normally use it with this
face wash from first aid Beauty washing
my hair I go to my Guardian fruity and
then I'm still using a Christmas body
wash
I bought some for the spring but I'm not
ready to break into them yet then we
move on to our face my morning routine
my face is super easy basically I just
focus on keeping it moisturized
that way my makeup goes on super
flawless
then I'll norm I pick out something
pretty comfy to wear vector odd is the
weekend and it is springtime so I'm
going to wear tank top and some white
pants my favorite body spray and this
isn't a makeup tutorial so I just slept
on the minimal makeup
well what I consider the minimal makeup
and then I am out and about to enjoy my
day
thank you guys so much for stopping by
my channel and viewing this video be
sure to give a thumbs up if you want to
see my nighttime routine for spring time
I love you guys and help see you all in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
