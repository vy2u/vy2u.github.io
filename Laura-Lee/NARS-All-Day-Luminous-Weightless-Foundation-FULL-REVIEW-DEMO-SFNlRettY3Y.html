full review on NARS this new foundation
this is their all day luminous
weightless film Vichy on it comes in
this really weird soft filling like
silicone feeling like bottle I picked
mine up at Sephora it was $48 I've just
been trying it out and this is a new
product on the market so I thought it's
time for a good old-fashioned foundation
review how do I review it for you guys
and I hope you want to know more about
it because you're gonna learn more about
it today please just keep watching
we start this video off I just want to
let you guys know it's claims it claims
to be a 16 hour where it claims to be
weightless it claims to be full coverage
it claims to be full coverage full
coverage if you want it to be and it
also claims to be to be buildable so it
claims to be everything run it for three
days straight now three days in a row
all day long to get a full view on it
and in my experience with it just about
everything they say about it is true I
know I know it's a lot but it's true
something is growling I am hungry I am
getting hangry it comes in this fabulous
square bottle it comes in a with a pump
on it which is just marvelous gotta have
the pump that's just like a number one
for me the color - in is Stromboli I
almost picked a dark - shade but the guy
Sephora totally helped me out thank God
because let me tell you something it is
so pigmented like the color that comes
out of this bottle it's extremely
extremely pigmented it doesn't have
color shade technology within it so it's
not gonna blend naturally to your actual
skin tone the color is what it is and it
is like super-powered what it is so I
just want to let you guys know that so
be sure to get your right shade if you
get the wrong shade is going to stick
out I am pretty handy with makeup but I
was like hey you help me because I don't
know mache was I picked out one too dark
I'm notorious for doing that because I
always think I'm a little Tanner than
what I am
it is liquidy a liquidy liquidy it is
not a cream foundation I personally
would not use a beauty blender with this
foundation because even if a beauty
blender is dampened I think it's going
to absorb a lot of the products still
because it's just so liquidy the texture
of it is actually really compatible to
the let me just get it out to the barrel
mineral skin foundation just like water
liquidy and I like that about it because
it blends out really easily I use a flat
top kabuki brush whenever I blend this
out and it works amazingly another thing
about this foundation a little goes a
long way so just know that don't give
pump happy because the first time I used
it uh pumped out like five pumps and
then I had enough
cover my face for three days as far as
the longevity of the foundation I think
it is a long wear foundation I didn't
see that it's left off I didn't see that
it moved around however I once who
always always wear a primer underneath
my foundation which helps with a
longevity of your product for a thin
formula that it is it lasted I don't
know about say 16 hours maybe like 8 or
9 though I mean enough it lasted enough
it's great with the last thing which
NARS is really good about that the next
thing is I know a lot of you guys have a
lot of questions excuse me
a lot of you guys have questions that
have oily skin it sets nicely I have dry
skin and it's perfect on my skin like it
just sets perfectly on my skin it
doesn't build up it isn't you know
hanging around dry areas and liquidy
foundations the dry quit can do that but
this one doesn't I actually would pretty
much recommend this for if you have only
skin I think you would like it but I
think that if you add it to many layers
of it you might have a problem so I
think if you have Olay skin you might
want to just do one thin layer be done
with it and it will be perfect on your
skin if you have dry skin I think you
can go for and start building it up and
adding as much coverage as you want
another thing about this super buildable
let me let you know that one facial
coverage of it is enough because a
little goes a long way the pigment is
crazy in it and the coverage is wild and
I think it's just a really cool
foundation because it's so sheer filling
but you know when you get it on your
skin you're just like Oh Who am I jaysus
the coverage is just amazing in it so if
you need a high coverage foundation I
definitely recommend this one to you
guys
I do have the first NARS foundation and
it's too heavy it's too thick it's full
coverage but it's just too much it
almost reminded me a little bit of
Studio Fix which I can't handle that
y'all this is the real world
I cannot go around what costume makeup
on okay
is like orange yeah this is an orange
foundation that I wore for a long time
because I thought it was my color and I
walked around looking like a pumpkin we
all make mistakes obviously I mean let's
just compare the color
oh and one big thing about this
foundation is because it's so liquidy if
you don't shake it you're going to have
a mess on your hands because the formula
and it breaks apart while it says there
so give it a really good shake before
you use this on your skin it pretty much
dries dry and SMM date that sounds weird
but some foundation is just dry feeling
but they don't ever dry they just feel
wet on your skin this one it's it's like
the skin it's orbs it a little bit and
it just really feels lightweight you
don't feel like a cake base you don't
feel like you're wearing so much makeup
but then you're getting the coverage of
something that is super heavy at the end
of this video I just want to say I think
this foundation is made for someone who
has a little bit of redness
discoloration they need coverage if you
need coverage and you want that full
coverage look go to this foundation this
is a good good product it's a good
foundation that I think I'm going to
much covered everything but if you have
any questions about it feel free to
comment down below and I will be sure to
answer because I love burning us
comments just so sweet well not all of
them
okay we are all up in the fights there's
our foundation gonna give it a good
shake and then I'm just going to pump
literally late literally I'm just gonna
pump two pumps doop doop and then what I
like to do personally you can do your
foundation how you want I mean just look
how liquidy that is so liquidy I like to
disperse it out on my face with my
finger I mean look how those two pumps
Oh cover my face like this is enough
from a whole face and we still have a
lot left I'm gonna take this flat top
kabuki brush here I'm going to start
patting it out
not really sure how to fix that
you
I mean you can see how much my dark
circle is covered right there it's
almost like I don't even need a
concealer but I'll add one just to add
brightening but not even for coverage I
look at that everything is a uniform
color because that coverage is so heavy
me with no contour no highlight just
literally the foundation my neck and
face match really well so this color is
great for me um I mean look at my under
eye area the darkness is completely gone
you don't see the freckles on my nose is
just I'm just covered I'm completely
covered I love that about this
foundation and you saw how thin and
liquid a it is it's like an airy filling
foundation and it allows your skin to
breathe so that's awesome that's
something I definitely look for in a
foundation that is it for this video I
love you guys they keep her coming by I
hope you got some insight on the new
sound good she own and I will see you
all in my next video that guys say hi to
your YouTube family we love each other
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
