for all the support and love Omak Laura
Laura
when I started my channel I never really
sing and getting to this point and
seeing YouTube grow itself throughout
the years and become so much more than
just little makeup tutorial like YouTube
is just became like this huge thing and
and I started over four years ago and it
wasn't that big of a thing and now it's
just everything in and I'm just like in
shock of all the world around me and all
this has happened through me posting
videos on YouTube so the journeys been
amazing and a little information behind
the shade by the way I created a shade
that I created because I normally do
wear a newbie pink lip that's no shock
or secret you guys have like their I
normally mix together three to four
shades like a nude lip liner a new
liquid lipstick a nude lipstick and a
new cloth like together mix it all
together to get the nude color that I
want it this is the color I would always
try to achieve so when I was in the lab
trying to create my perfect nude shade I
created the color that I've always been
trying to great and it's such a wearable
color it's so easy to wear it has a
matte finish and yeah that's why I
created it created it so to be easy you
can throw at your purse and just go
don't you have to think about it and go
you know it looks good okay so thank you
guys again we're going to go ahead and
jump right in I'm going to show you this
tutorial very light natural but I wanted
to do an easy look to go with the easy
to show you how easy the lip is and um
can I have like that everyday moment
with it and I also added some faux
freckles but they're kind of not so
freckles because I just added the faux
freckles pretty much on top of my real
freckles because all of you know I'm a
freshly girl and I've had freckles my
whole life so it's a turn on top well
does intros getting long girl let's jump
right in and get started
first things first were to prime our
face using when my favorite primers this
one is my ELF as nothing on the great
and I just get a little dab how like
that it is a white lotion II feel and I
just mushed onto the end especially the
place where I have more pores right in
the smile line so they can also feel
tacky so like helps the makeup out of
here next I'm going to go in with the
next to nothing foundation by Mac if you
haven't seen my full review on this you
can
once I only get read on them low and
basically this is a foundation as a bit
of color to your skin but not really
that much coverage so I mean I want a
little bit of coverage so I may add in a
little dot of my Pro Longwear concealer
in with it but I'm pretty much just
going to use this on my freckle show
through and you can really see the skin
you know what brush I'm going to use and
I'm going to use a white six brush from
Mufi more feet and just start blending
this on out a lot of this hair always
have to get my makeup I'm just gonna
like try to sprinkle it around my nose
see how it does so a little bit of
coverage but I will try to go back and
add a little bit of freckling on to my
freckles to like basically make them pop
again very lightly going over the nose
and then just a little bit across the
forehead my unibrow area gets really red
so I like to get some coverage on there
I've always had a red you know where I
like right through here to skin issues
always in red so just something I live
with and if you can see like you can
still see the freckling especially right
through here and even a little bit on my
cheeks and we'll try to anticipate so
moving on I am going to take my Mac Pro
Longwear it come seal it it's getting a
small amount on the back of my hand I'm
going to take a g36 brush from morphe
gets a little a stray hair coming out of
it I'm going to cut that get out of here
little hair cut so I just like that
darkness right in there it's got to go
whether we're doing natural Nellie
everyday glam kind of makeup look or not
girl weeing playing with dark circles
and so I'm just going to like add a
little bit of it on the my brush and
just Pat it out this like a mini kabuki
brush is so cute maybe a little around
the nose too
like that next up I'm going to take the
setting side from my wet and wild
contour palette this is a really nice
affordable setting powder I'm going to
take it in 5:10 yeah that's right in
five ten I normally use this brush for
putting highlighter
on but I'm just trying to use it to fix
this clean to like set this makeup honey
honey bunny I don't want these dark
circles I'm just going to go ahead and
set places if you have places specific
places to get a little gravy throughout
the day I recommend to go ahead and toss
in a little bit of setting powder onto
those areas next I'm going to go in it
with a little bit of Mac give me a son
and I'm going to take go where's your
brush a morpheus ePHI three elite
collection brush no the great thing
about this it's not actually a bronzer
with and mineral skin finish so it's
really natural on the skin and I'll just
swivel some on our brush and instead of
contouring it literally looks like
you're a little bit sunkissed and I was
dusted around this area just to warm it
up and then I'll go ahead and start
dragging it right around the forehead
area because the temples are naturally
an area to get sunkissed anyways just
like in a circular motion we're just
going to buff all that out and a little
bit on the chin chinny-chin-chin and
I'll even drag some down the neck just
so my neckline matches and looks a
little contoured right there there
I love the sunkissed look I just think
it looks so pretty I'm going to grab
just a little bit of the wet and wild
bronze contour and just snatch my nose a
little bit and I think I look really
bronze and warm
I'm going to take my white 4 brush and
I'm going to go in with a bit of this
Rimmel London like Kate Moss this is
like a gold ii-era destiny blush color
I'm just going to pop that on to the
apples of the cheek this is a very warm
blush color and it like almost has a
golden sheen to it and I think it's so
pretty if you want to clean up your bum
jaw area you can take a little bit of
your facial powder this is my and just
kind of like set everything just so you
don't look to oranjee down there I'm
going to take out our 36 brush and
my Oprah highlighter in Rodeo Drive
we're going to learn without people I'm
going to go ahead and a little bit right
here on the upper cheekbone and just
make sure to blend it where there's no
harsh edges on it and then I'll slip it
right up and maybe a DAB on my forehead
add some on the nose and now I am going
to do some faux freckling this is an
elbow for brush I'm going to use it as
you can see it's a tiny Titan and little
pencil brush I'm going to use some of
the brown contour side from the wet and
wild palette and come on now open I'm
going to get a tiny amount and what I'm
going to do is I trace the freckles that
are already on my face and just darken
my natural freckles if you don't have
freckles on your face you want to try
this out you do more clusters a freckle
soon here and have them scatter about
throughout your cheeks you can honestly
do it any way that you want to I've had
on my whole entire life you know a
little bit I had these same freckles I
would go very light handed when doing
this I find that you wouldn't realize
because freckles are such a faint thing
on people's face but from a distance
like they add up can you even pat it out
a little bit I would personally prefer
using a cool toned product too when
adding freckles rather than like a give
me Sun I feel like it's a little too
warm but you can technically do you know
whatever you want I'm kind of faux
freckling but I'm kind of not because
I'm just like tracing out where I see my
own freckles peeking through and like
deepening them if I suppose makeup on
top of them actually going to get a tiny
eyeliner brush to do some of these so
that they're more sporadic on my cheeks
and then I'm going to pounce oh they're
not so aggressive there you have some so
freckling I'm going to now put my
eyebrows and I'll be right back
I'm going to do just very minimal
make-up to our eyes next I'm going to
take my hip pot and soft ochre and just
do a little bit of eye priming
as far as the actual eyelid goes like my
overall goal here is to make it like as
simple as I possibly can
I want the lashes and lips and like so
far close and I'll be like the moment to
take here I'm going to take the penny I
just pinch the fire on my hands okay I'm
going to take the 35-hour palette from
morphe and I'm going to grab this color
right here this is it m57 three brush
I'm just going to pop this in the crease
and work it back and forth back and
forth
small swivels and then look at that then
with my finger on my tape is pretty
champagne color I'm just going to pop it
on to my eyelid and we link so easy
right and then I'll go back and without
blending brushes soften the edges I'm
going to take that color in the inner
corner as well and that is legit all men
do for eyeshadow I guess I won't like
the skin so freckles and lips and all to
be the focus of this book I'm never
going to add a pair of my favorite
lashes I'm wearing on stop these are my
Amy by Lily lashes oh they're so pretty
you always want to trim your false
lashes before you bring down because
girl if not you could have a disaster on
your hands you're about to see the drama
these are going to give me oh there's
some pretty I get a little bit of the
lash glue on the back of my brush and
just like swipe it across the lash band
and then I'll set my lash down and allow
it to dry the glue to come a little bit
tacky now dry all the way but just to
get a little bit tacky before I apply
the eyelash to my eye that way it sticks
way it better it's just like so much
easier to apply next time I think a
little bit of my ese water eyeliner ever
on top line to like help hide the lash
band because no one would ever be able
to tell them wearing false lashes so
honestly with a lash part like you can
take parts in this tutorial that you
love you can leave parts off you're not
a
posh girl I completely understand just
build up your lashes with your favorite
mascara the liquid conscious is pretty I
however in a false lash girl like I love
them so much I just can't help it
I'm also going to add a little bit of my
Big Shot mascara by Maybelline and I'm
just going to roll it under to connect
my real assault flashes together I mean
yeah lashes add the drama and they make
the eyes look like kind of flirty but I
feel like you know building up your own
lashes it's just a beautiful natural
look - I'm going to go back in with our
pretty brown shade right here and dust
it on the under eye area
now they really open up the eyes I'm
going to take a fake awake liner this is
the inner rim liner from Tarte and I'll
line my inner waterline however some of
the black liner is dripping down from my
top line but we'll pretend that it's not
and now I'm just going to take a little
bit about mascara and add it to my lower
lash and last but certainly not least
I'm going to take my child while early X
Mac cosmetic and apply it to my lips
and last but not least I'm going to add
a little bit of a Mac kind of Fink
sprayer to kind of like sue everything
and melt all these powders down alright
