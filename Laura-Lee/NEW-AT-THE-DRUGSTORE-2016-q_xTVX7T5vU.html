cuz I added some additional lighting and
it's so bright that it's just burning my
retinas and I have to talk to you guys
like this day's video is going to be a
what's new at the drugstore the
drugstore is popping with new products
new products new products and I got my
goal and I think when I was in Alabama
me and my sister went to Walgreens my
sister mom and niece went to Walgreens
and I had a good the bathroom really bad
and my sister wouldn't hurry up and I
also remember is we were arguing the
whole time because she wouldn't quit
looking at stuff laws about the paint my
pants and um so that happened I don't
know why I'm telling that story scratch
all that while we were there I literally
bought everything I could find it was
new and Maybelline also sent over a
couple of new things so I'm going to be
kind of like swatching giving my opinion
on the things me and my sister already
went through a bunch of it and did
swatches if you follow me on snapchat
you saw that and really quick I want to
address the background what's going on
there is I started wanting to play
around with my backgrounds and then I
went out of town for a while and my cat
decided he wanted to destroy and break
and tear down everything on my old
background because there's these little
lights and they're on strings into this
a cat this is very enticing and all he
wants to do is just pawn and so they
were wrapped around picture frames and
plans and whenever he yeah I know what
he did he pulled on them and everything
just fell so now I'm inspired to redo my
background so this is actually a rug
okay I'm getting desperate here that's
gonna be my background for just like a
week or two until I can buy new things
for my actual new background so thank
you Lou thank you can always count on
you to destroy my background let's jump
right in and let's get started give me a
thumbs up if you enjoy
let's just talk about eyeshadow palettes
I don't want to really go brand by brand
first when I picked up at Walgreens this
one is the covergirl true naked cold I
know there is a maroon e one but I just
picked up the gold ones so on the
palette it says shades like a leading
$50 eyeshadow palette and my first thing
was like okay shades like one I get you
said shades but I mean come on you're
still putting sponge applicator some on
covergirl we're better than that
so you do get a good bit of shades how
many do you get you get eight different
shades
I've already swatch tinplate with this
on snap and I let you guys know I think
the shimmery shades are quality of a $50
extra DiPaola I think they're really
nice quality however you don't get
enough matte shades in the palette for
me to come make a complete look and
that's a personal preference I always
like to blend matte shades first and
then create some shimmer shades I would
never do a complete makeup look with
shimmers only I just would never do it I
would always reach for another palette
or another eyeshadow I couldn't like I
couldn't just take this with me
somewhere and create a complete look and
so this one does have three matte shades
out of the eight colors but the matte
shades are a little bit they're just not
good okay I said it they're not good I
don't like the matte shades they're
chalky and if you actually like I tested
these out and swatches with a brush or
with a sponge applicator um no and even
with the brush it would be a softer
swatch so it would even come off worse
so the matte shades know the shimmer
sage the shimmer showed her shirt right
it definite yes we want to talk about
the Revlon I can think I got this one
actually at Ulta the Revlon just not
nudes palette really great arrangement
of colors let me first start off by
saying that and I believe my overall oh
I know I remember my overall thoughts on
this palette every color and it was very
nice very pigmented creamy except for
the light the two or actually the three
lighter matte shades
they came off chalky but these darker
matte shades I actually actually just
this Doug Brown matte shade was really
nice it was very creamy you could
definitely do some work with that
actually I think was just like these
light two ones right here very dry and
chalky and it would just be like if you
put it on your eye nope but other than
that I like the arrangement colors in
this palette I think you could create a
lot of looks I think that if you needed
a lighter matte shade you would have to
reach for another palette just because
this just wasn't cutting it for me but
overall definitely worth the money I
would get this palette of another
palette and it's by Maybelline the nudes
no let me just start off by saying that
the first the original news palette by
Maybelline I liked it a lot because it
was like the first time the drugstore
actually came out with like a full eyes
shadow palette with a good arrangement
of gnu's matte and shimmer so they just
kept going with it but at the end of the
day reality is they're not pigmented at
all they're cheap quality eyeshadows um
and I hate saying that because I really
like Maybelline I love a lot of their
products I think they're one of the best
drugstore makeup brands out there they
create boot qoodles of absolutely
amazing makeups their eyeshadows are
probably the weakest point in makeup I
wouldn't waste my money on another
Maybelline nude palette but by the way
this one is the rock news lastly Milani
is step in their game up and they come
out with the O to Baroness se this is
the bare necessities there's something
something said you guys remember that
song don't worry about your wheezing
yourself I'm not singing the lyrics
right but it's off of the jungle book
bare necessities okay I see what you did
Milani they're like we didn't do that
Laura that's just you let me let me let
me let you know I love this palette all
the colors and it turned out really
pretty you get one too matte shades and
the rest are shimmer so reality is I
probably would reach for a few more
matte eyeshadow shades when creating a
look and using this palette but it's a
really nice palette the colors are nice
and creamy
especially the shimmery ones it is a
little bit like dusty like you can see
like I don't know it's a little dusty
but it's well worth the money
and it actually comes with this nice
double ended brush hello I was very very
proud of them for doing but and also
Milani makes a great eye primer so I
would get the eye primer with it if you
don't have a good one on hand but this
palette is awesome I don't know I'm sure
they have um I'm sure they have
different like shades in them I think I
might have seen that I may be making
that up who knows but this is the one
that I picked out because I figure this
is someone that would be most used and I
wanted to give you guys the rundown on
it and I like it a lot and also on the
back I just want to say that if you're
confused everywhere to put your product
placement as far as on your eyeshadows
they have like a little graph like base
contour lid crease liner you know what I
mean
next let's move on and talk about
palettes for the face the first one I
want to talk to you guys about is by
Maybelline this is the master contour
I'm really excited about this palette
because it's about time that we start
eating into contour palettes at the
drugstore and you know get some
affordable tanks on the Shelf because as
we know contouring highlighting and the
whole shebang and palettes is really big
in high-end department stores but at the
drugstore they just seem to be slacking
lo and behold we have Maybelline who
stepped it up and came out with this
palette first I want to go ahead excuse
me say on the back of the palette it
does have a step by step if you are
confused or a just write up tells you
engraved in the product I it's kind of a
pet peeve moment drugstores do that like
they ain't grade contour number one and
I know it's a marketing thing and it's
to help people but oh no it just makes
it look cheap I'm like come on we know
we know that's what YouTube videos are
for let me say one more thing about it
it comes with this nice brush you can
see it the brush I honestly it's quite
stiff so I wouldn't use it for a blush
or a bronzer but it would be like a
perfect highlight brush like really nice
highlight brush I adore all the colors
in this palette and what's so funny my
sister me we're playing with them and
she was like I can already tell would
hate that palette because it would just
be like one by urban decay that I hate
that has the three you guys know what
I'm talking about
I never tried that one out she didn't
she hated it and then she calls me she's
like I bought the palette and I love it
oh I'm like actually this is a favorite
thing at the drugstore that's news it I
found so far this is the Wet n Wild
lumen ating palette this one is in
catwalk pink and it says this is a new
formula and I do believe that because I
swatch these with a wet and wild brush
on the back of my hand like I literally
dusted them on the back of my hand with
a brush and the color pigmentation was
just phenomenal paid $4.99 for this
palette it's beautiful it is a beautiful
palette and you get four different
highlight shades everybody needs this
palette in your collection if you are a
highlight junkie as I am so look how
huge it is it's like the size of my hand
next palette that I'm super impressed
with I mean like I'm very impressed with
the facial palettes at the drugstore but
the next one is this wet and wild the
contour palette they have a couple
different shades in it I picked this one
because the brown seemed like it would
be a good at brown color for my skin
tone and on the back it does tell you
how to use it and where to place each
color it's amazing the colors are just
like literally you could just press your
fingers and look at that I didn't swipe
I just pressed my fingers on it and that
crazy is so creamy I definitely
recommend going in with a light hand
when using it this one the color I got
it in is why does it have to be weird
why can it be like shade one or shade
two - shade 74 nine-a Brown it's just a
really nice cool tone Brown and then
this one it has a little bit of a yellow
undertone which is perfect and they just
feel like butter they're so soft and
creamy I found these two at Walgreens
cuz I notice sometimes you guys are like
where do I get went while and stuff like
that next we're gonna talk about a new
foundation from the dress wear this is
the dream velvet from Maybelline and I
think I am in shade 75 natural beige
sometimes I make that up Foundation is
honestly something I haven't been able
to try out too much so I don't want to
give like my firm opinion on it my
opinion might change a little bit but
it's supposed to be a like a matte
finish but hydrating so that's something
you don't see a lot normally whenever
it's a matte finish foundation you get a
drier finish
whenever it's like a dewy finish you get
more moisture into your skin but this
makes claims of being a soft matte
finish and hydrating I think it
definitely gives you a nice soft matte
finish it feels really nice on the skin
they have a good arrangement of colors
it's very lightweight it feels super
like a whipped foundation
I think it's an original foundation they
come out with which Maybelline is so
good about doing so far I like it let me
just say that I'm going to keep wearing
it I'll incorporate it and into upcoming
tutorials so you guys can actually like
see me apply it and see you on the skin
let me just say it does come with this
blender to apply it with and in my
opinion I hate blenders like on a stick
just the blenders just too hard for me
it feels like a brick um I gotta blend
out my foundation I just wouldn't I
would use my hand or my kabuki with this
so we'll see what happens I'm going to
tamper around with a little more I won't
keep you posted on this one one that I
have tried out and I do like this is a
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion now Shay
w3 is too light from me
but Lauri oh my god it was very kind and
they actually sent me three of them and
I think I'm going to be 3.5 so that just
worked out perfectly thank you i haven't
opened these but i thought i bought this
one and of course I opened it and played
with it so what it is is it's like a
little compact you may have seen these
before comes with this little pad and
that's to apply your foundation I didn't
use the pad I use my fingers I'm going
to try it out with a pad I should you
can see my pad is clean and then it
opens up and you get your products so I
want to say that you may feel like
you're not getting a lot of foundation
but you really are this bunch in here is
super super super saturated I felt like
it is Lumi
but I did feel like my skin was really
wet looking whenever I used it be
personally I think the coverage was nice
medium coverage and buildable I actually
think it's going to look really pretty
if I continue wearing it on my skin tour
in the winter but I could just see this
being like a sloshy holy mess if I
worked in this summertime because my
forehead for whatever reason becomes
like an old old slick
easy Pitt a fried chicken right up and
chair two primers that came out from the
drugstore are the Milani Prime shield
and the prime perfection the prime
perfection is the hydrating one so if
you have dry skin and you want that nice
moisturized plush base before you put
your foundation on go with this one now
the black point which is the prime
shield is the mattifying one and this is
going to be your silicon based primer
that fills in your pores if you have big
pores or some acne scarring or just
unwanted areas text your problems with
your skin this is gonna be your guy I
like both of them I think they both work
really well my personal favorite is the
hydrating one like I said I have dry
skin it's pretty nice and hydrating but
the thing I like most about it is it's
all free
that's right hydrating Bowl free and so
I feel like it's a water-based primer
and it's hydrating but you don't have to
worry about it clogging your pores so
this is definitely a nice new primer
from the drugstore another product
that's new from the drugstore is the
master precise skinny eyeliner this one
is my Maybelline the shade that I like
is 210 defining black I think this is a
total dupe for I want to say hourglass
came out with a really skinny eyeliner
this is a super super black one which I
like my eyeliners to be like black black
black and I definitely like line which
would like this for top lining to get
right up in there without creating a
mess or to fill in the waterline there's
lots of uses for little liners like this
but I think it's great wouldn't buy this
to line your eyelid or do wing liner
every day except like you would use it
up so so so fast but if you need a
little liner just to do the bottom lash
line your waterline or top line or even
if you do like a really thin liner on
top this is going to be your guy it's a
really nice black liner from the
drugstore and it's new and as I say I'm
telling you I think it's a dupe for that
hourglass one next I want to share with
you guys the new lippies from Maybelline
these are the vivid matte liquids so
immediately I thought that these were
liquid lipsticks for like three seconds
and right until I opened the package and
gave it a swatch and then I immediately
realized by the texture
that this was not going to dry and that
this is just like or they remind me
they're just like the UM soft matte lip
creams by NYX those have been around for
a really long time and a weird thing
about it is the finish of these are not
that that that matte they are kind of
mad I just still see a little bit of
shimmer or like a little bit of shine to
them which I thought was a little bit
bizarre for it to be like a mattifying
lippy um so it's not going to dry either
like this soft matte lip cream so don't
really dry it's almost like a matte lip
gloss that you're putting on your lips
they're very very pigmented so you're
pretty much gonna get this color on your
lips which I love that about these
they're so pigmented look at that but so
you can see I don't know if you can but
you I can see that shine em and whenever
I got them on my lips
you could definitely see like that
shimmery shine and I was like oh man
that another new product from the
drugstore are these brow pencils and let
me let you know I am afraid of these and
makeup does not scare me let me tell you
why I'm afraid of these because the
friggin tip of this is huge
and I just see it creating a nightmare
on my eyebrow here's me like I would I
feel like I'm taking one of those fat
Crayola crayons and drawing on my
eyebrows and that is terrifying the
color comes off pretty light as you can
see I'm rubbing it is not going to come
off like that doodoo brown color like it
gives you a nice light faded look it's
like it's got wax in it which is good
for the brows but this is just too big
to get that nice precise brow oh my god
I'm scared I don't know I haven't really
used them yet because I don't really
want to have a bad brow day yet and
that's what I think is immediately gonna
happen so I'm terrified of these I feel
like this might be good if you're one of
those beautiful people out there who
have nice thick gooshie hairy eyebrows
and then you just want to fill in a
little bit I think this is the only way
that this would work out is a good
product next when the dress where is
this Revlon all-in-one ultimate mascara
this is the
new mascara it's supposed to be like
literally all-in-one it's supposed to
give your lashes link definition volume
it says to be super black the one on it
is a plastic hard weird one look at it
so strange but I definitely could build
up some lashes with this one like I know
this one looks crazy but right whenever
the first time I saw it I was like I
could make things happen with this one
and it's small and even like the spikes
on it are like so freakin teeny-tiny I
mean it's interesting looking
I think this mascara has little fibers
in it or else my cat's got in it my
cat's probably got in it oh I have to
talk to you about this Maybelline the
color tattoos okay so Maybelline Color
tattoos is their cream those cream
little pots and they've always been
awesome right when they came out they
got really popular so it looks like they
have put them into crayons and I think
that they are just as awesome as the
color tattoos I mean talk about pigment
so this I think is Maybelline's like
it's on my tooth pretend you didn't see
that this is Maybelline strong point
with makeup the cream color and I love
cream color especially if you already
have an eyeshadow and you need like if
I'm going to do a gold lid I think that
you could either do this alone or you
can make this as the base of your gold
lid and then put cool I shadow on top
and get a really intense gold lid they
last so long they make like I said as a
great eye primer
I love these color tattoos I love oh
mood so that is it for this video we
