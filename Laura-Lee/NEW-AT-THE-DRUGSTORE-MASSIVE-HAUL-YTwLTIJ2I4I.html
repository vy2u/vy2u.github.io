is going to be a what's new at the
drugstore video I went to Walgreens and
CVS and also PR to send me a couple new
drugstore products and I wanted to share
with you all the new exciting goodies so
we're going to jump right in but before
we do today is the last day to enter my
giveaway I'm giving away a MacBook and
the only way to enter is just subscribe
to my channel it in today it ends at
midnight EST time I will announce the
winner in a later video subscription and
then I will also announce it like with
in a later video like a verbally
remember to subscribe to my channel last
and in or you know one of those oh oh
all right so let's jump right in and get
started
wow it's also good to be I should have
probably added this in my intro but
whatever but it feels so good feedback
something I have been all over the place
traveling if you follow me on snapchat
well then you already been on the end
and I announce a very special
collaboration that I'm working on on
snapchat and Instagram so be sure and
follow me there for more info
yeah girl happening now will officially
jump right in the first product that has
come out recently is the 24 karat new
toilet from Maybelline and I shut out a
lot of these palettes and I haven't had
that much luck with them I love the
shimmers and all but the Mavs are a
little bit chalky and dry and not very
pigmented so let's test this one out I
mean I already know like that's a super
pretty
shimmer oh yeah I like I have so much
luck with the shimmers in these see the
matte this little matte color right here
it looks way prettier than the other
ones in the other palette so this
palette I might have a little bit of
success with has anyone tried this
palette ality see look how pigmented
that matte is holy crap that is 20 times
better than the previous palette and
yeah I think I'm gonna have a little bit
more luck with this I'm looking around
for a makeup wife because it's going to
wipe it on my pan does anyone else do
that want are getting ready they like
wipe it on a towel on their pants I want
to do kind of a tutorial with this like
look at the pigmentation I really think
I can pull something off with this
palette I don't know if they split up
their formulations or what it is but
this one feels way better than the
previous nudes palette has anyone tried
it more you thought I really wanted to
do a full review on this foundation
about to show you but I traveled you got
crazy I don't have time to do it so I'm
going to mention it to you in this video
I haven't watched any reviews on it yet
this is like I feel like it like changes
my opinion whenever I watch review so I
always like to have us a really raw fill
to new foundations at least this is the
l'oreal infallible total cover
foundation it's so sweet super full
coverage I like the little sweetie tube
a lot high bay came in the makeup wipes
in the living room thank you
whoa Bama check out the shade 305
natural beige Oh looks like a big turd
there it's like so thick and whip
feeling good love how much Selma well I
am really interested to try this out
should I review I don't know it's so
full coverage it feels like a whipped
foundation so and this color looks like
it could possibly work for me I got a
little pan going on whenever I went to
st. mom so I'm a little bit darker than
oil I'm going to test this out and also
I'm just going to mention real quick
it's a new neck total control foundation
drop came out this is the brush that
it's recommended to use with this it has
a divot in it I did a full review on it
on my channel I'll link it down below
that way you can check that video out
and you want to know more but just to
mention to you this is another new
foundation that hit our drugstore I
actually have a third one and then I'll
make came out with healthy glow makeup
gradual self pan now as I looked at this
package I would think this is like
shimmer lotion this is what it looks
like we give it to stall at the
drugstore but then I squeeze some outlaw
is testing it and it was like a
foundation all right so I'm going to
test out light/medium
oh look at that pump I forgot there was
a pump on it I tested this out before I
left for my trips I forgot what it look
like so they live little pop and then
two separate products comes out show you
you see how two different products comes
out there it's like as blowing product
in a foundation look at the cover to
like help sticks that is that is a super
wet looking a girl foundation it has SPF
20 in it and it says the gradual self
tanning foundation so it's just the tan
your skin while you're wearing it I'm
about all that but I'm going to try it
out because it could be an amazing
product it's also hyper inert Alois
hypoallergenic for my friends out there
who have allergies or sensitive skin
listen Oh product that came out with us
pretty talk about this by L'Oreal and
this is her brow stylist frame inset and
what it looks like it's like a little
drugstore version of on associate dip
brow pomade and it also came with a nice
angled brush with a spoolie on the end
watched it playing around and it
actually looked pretty nice actually
like Burnett just because I lined my
ends a little bit I wanted to lighten my
brows just a little bit but I think
that's going to be too light but I
tested it out and it worked out pretty
well it doesn't have that tacky feel
that the dip brow pomade has it has more
of a powdery so when she to iron
eyebrows but I really like the brush
that came with it
and the product is interesting you know
so I'm going to be playing with this
more and then also L'Oreal came out with
this fun who's already open for my
convenience this is the blend artist and
fallible con for blending class I
actually came out with quite a few news
budget so this is the one that I picked
up and then whenever I took it out of
the package it feels like really rubbery
and hard it doesn't feel like a sponge
material I like the shape of it because
you could definitely like bake with and
I maybe get up under that under art that
has a sharp little edge but I think you
may be too hard to blend out a cream
product with like to really get in there
and blend it out it's just tuned in
and this is just me judging it based on
what I still write now I haven't
actually tried it out like dampen but I
don't know I can sense a bad sponge you
know what I mean like I'm like you know
I might blend is maybe like really
bouncy then you know you get yourself a
good sponge you know you L next moving
on I found five dollar liquid lipstick
there by Jordana cosmetics they make
really great products for a very low
price cities are still liquidy but I
don't know if they dry all the way and
they're so freakin pretty and oh there's
no hope let's watch a few and then let
it dry on my hand and see if it's like
drying or whipped a really consistent
color to on these leaked could be great
I haven't tried them on my lips like I
said I'm just like stuff that I bought
up just like trying it out we're trying
out together
oh so I just watched the three and gosh
these colors are so pretty actually
bought a lot of them for five dollars
apiece and these work out I mean they're
going to be like a masterpiece there I'm
going to move on to Colette the product
and they want to see if they dry all the
way
also by Jordana I bought two things and
I bought the glow highlighter stick and
then I brought this sculpting go creamy
contour stick the color is medium that I
have this in and it feels like it's
going to be a great product
it feels really creamy and easy to blend
out just like super it almost feels like
a high-end contour stick which could be
a very affordable way to get started and
cream contouring without wasting your
money on really high-end products that
may not work out for you or you may not
like creams on Dori and then you spend
your money on a really high-end product
being really annoyed with yourself you
like no no I have to cream contour but
this could be a cool way to test it out
is it like runs out into a powder which
is really nice and then I already
squashed this highlighter stick and
unfortunately like once I blended it out
it like disappeared into nothing
looking down into my monitor people say
all the time stop looking at yourself in
the mirror and I'm like honey I am NOT
the piss of my spy l puck looking at
myself in the monitor to make sure it's
in focus and you can see what I'm
talking about
I don't recommend this speculate ones
out for nothing and I'll buy oh girl no
exon we all came out with infallible
paints this is a little blush palette
won't bring something speaker on
everything when you do the head hairs
the blush palette I really am digging at
these peachy color because peach is like
my color the pink colors are like really
bright I don't wear a lot of like hot
pink blush what is my actual blushes are
really nice and pigmented I think once
you put them on with a brush it we
really pre on your skin however their
matte and they're really pigmented so
you might want to go in with a light
hand with these because they could be
very like all over your face and no one
wants like that much product on the face
so I'm definitely gonna be playing with
this more but they're just like so
incredibly pigmented maybe that's why
it's called infallible paint but I can't
wait to try it out and just confirmation
these did pretty much dry down all the
way and they dread out all the way but
they feel a little bit gooey which could
be a good thing because normally if you
ever had a little bit of stickers that
you put on and it's like substance to
your lips and have that very dry still
but yet it's always a little bit goopy
and doesn't crack and I kind of like
that because you don't get the cracking
in it whenever it's a little goopy and
that's what I'm selling from these like
it's not like 120 percent kiss proof but
I feel he's not going to crack on your
lips and it's also not whipped so it'll
still laughs really really long time so
you'll get the best of both worlds ease
oh this smells so good dollars make you
pile up I made Taiyo penalties because I
can't with my nails if n Maybelline came
out with a bunch of their new lipsticks
which are recommended I think peachy
keen to you guys I think this name of it
in my 2016 favorites but they also came
out when lip liners go with Alisha the
color sensational shape liner and
they're all nude and I bet like these
colors and most definitely a do for some
mac liner out there on the market these
are also very pigmented and creamy and
if you need some new affordable lip
liners good Lord ethers
it's just like the colors that there's
literally a hairball on the end of this
one but if you need a good nude with
line are you going to send home in the
leg like Maybelline is getting their new
colors down honey
lastly loriel sent me a package of new
hair care from accentuating and I busted
like this clay ball with a hammer to get
it like it came in a clay ball and I
might beat the hell out of it I was like
yeah it's a product and do this like
they're new clay line of products so you
get a light came in a clay ball okay
we'll move on anyways this is the
extraordinary clay mask but it's for
your hair and to pre shampoo treatment
and oh looks like it's for only root
that is so interesting it absorbs oil so
if you have liked a really Oly scalp or
you like forced to wash your hair
everyday you might want to try this
product like I've never heard of
something exactly like this before it's
always about the nourishment for your
hair but I feel like people have very
oily scalp like they get left out no it
smells a little clay but also snow it's
really freaking good their dry shampoo
extraordinary clay dry shampoo this
smells heavenly says absorbs excess oil
for your hair I kind of train my hair to
be like less greasy because it you have
to wash my hair every day but then I
just like stopped and like used to LA
dry shampoo baby powder and like fall
through the grease and now my hair I
wash it like every three days maybe even
a little less than that and then this
one is the rebalancing sham to create
our purified roots and hydrated in it so
it absorbs excess old I'm going to wash
my hair with this um in like three days
and see what happens because I don't
know this blue you never hear about
shampoos there specifically for Olli
hair it's all about what can nourish
your hair the most so I'm interested to
see what happens with that
LoZ embarrassing alright guys so I think
