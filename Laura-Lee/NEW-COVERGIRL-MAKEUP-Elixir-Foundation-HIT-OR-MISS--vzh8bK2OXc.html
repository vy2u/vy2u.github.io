video is going to be testing out the new
covergirl products especially this new
healthy elixir foundation a lot of you
guys have requested that I tested out so
I finally found it at CVS Emily wasn't
coming home I would go to a couple of
drugstores to find this it just released
and I also have obviously a couple of
different new all covergirl products
that pass out in this video so I'm super
excited to share with before we get
started though be sure and subscribe to
my channel so that's so it and without
further ado we have a lot of products
with test alpha girl let's go ahead and
jump right in
alright it's me close up and personal
and first I'm going to clip this hiya
out of the spice look at the shirts like
choking me now the hair away hair gets a
liner so bad when I try to make up like
it's my pet peeve I can't stand it in my
face and we're trying to make up so for
those of you who don't know I've already
primed at my skin so my skin is ready to
go have a little bump right in here
because I picked at it I bought a couple
of different shades 742 725 and 720 720
maybe pink I kind of try 742 I don't
know what shade to try this is a light
weight full coverage makeup formula it
hydrates the skin and it has SPF 20 in
it vitamins and antioxidants and it's
all free so this is a lot to live up to
you get I'm assuming one fluid out to
this one fluid out so you get your
average size I really like the bottle I
like the pump I think it's really pre
and sleek as well yeah this is going to
be my shade I mean you shade 7:42 medium
beige this feels kind of thick and
creamy it's not that liquidy my lips are
burning so bad because before I start at
like a lip plumper gloss on now might
want to do that I'm gonna be using my
wife expressed formal day my last
expression all day I use it in every
video just about so you guys already
know the drill with this and we're going
to go ahead and start blending lips I
own
shade the smells pretty good it doesn't
a strong smell to the foundation does
have a faint smell to it in a decimal
pretty darn good it's blending out
really easy and I also think it would
blend out nice with a beauty blender as
well if you are a beauty blender lover
as most you guys know I will finish off
this review this foundation by typing it
out in the description box how at war
I'm going to do a date night tonight
with Ty probably or out some might see
movie with everybody and we'll go see
the movie snatched so either way I'll
have the foundation on for a long time
as far as like right now the foundation
is looking really pretty on my skin you
don't have to blend it out quickly
because it seems to not be drying fast
on my skin it's just blending out so
easy I don't think it's that heavy but I
don't think it's that lightweight of a
foundation it feels really if you can
see like sticky and damp on my skin well
we got to get that nose right there like
right off the bat I think it looks
really pretty on my skin and I don't I
think it's buildable but not crazy full
coverage where it's like hey would it
definitely have some coverage to it as
you can see it's not like it's thin
foundation you can barely see it my
freckles appearing through especially
you can even see them coming through
right here so first impressions girl I'm
liking it honey that looks really pretty
I'm impressed so far also if you've
tried this at home let me know in the
comment section unimportant part in
trying out foundation in my opinion is
finding out how products work with the
foundations we like to apply our
highlight and all that jazz so I have
the new outlast all day
concealer I think I'm going to use I
don't know what shade I'm going to use
I'm gonna go ahead and try these out
with it as well
open oh we got a different this
applicator is really hard on the product
so I don't know how I'm going to love
that on my under-eye let's see I'm going
to be using the light pills I'm actually
just going to apply it my fingers I
don't like how hard that applicator is
it feels really soft and whiffed
see what kind of coverage we can get out
of this stuff I'm going to take AG 37
and I'm just going to tap out this
product I am NOT living for the skin to
litter out the back so I can see my
darkness just peering right through it's
still pretty thin hmm he's not too too
shabby but I don't know we'll see what
happens it's just still kind of greasy
and kind of thin right off the bat so I
might be sticking with my Maybelline age
rewind for my drugstore concealer we'll
see I think the most coverage we're
getting there is coming from the
foundation I don't hate the concealer
but I'm not like living for it so I like
a lot of coverage out of my concealer
however I don't think it's creasing too
bad so that's nice I'm going to take
this little sponge and add some setting
powder to make sure we lock in
everything so we can get a true test of
how it wears we tend to get 41 big old
powder brush and I'm just going to start
buffing away all the excess powder so we
can move on with the little impressions
toot mm-hmm I mean I don't think it
looks too shabby I don't hate the it's
delicious like a lot of darkness peering
through and I felt like it was
lightweight and greasy which is two
things I don't stand for so let's just
move on I'm going to start stop dwelling
on it so next I got this true blend
baked bronzer this one isn't shade at
200 and we're going to try it out I've
never tried out when they're baked
products before so here we go
with a Wi-Fi brush I'm just going to tap
them on here get the excess off right
okay she's pigmented I see this is
pretty I actually don't have a lot of
drugstore bronzers and I'm like obsessed
with so this could be like a new
favorite of mine huh feel like it might
be getting a little bit patchy let's see
what happens so it actually has a little
bit I don't know if you tale of like
this golden plate to it which I find to
be really pretty on the skin but if you
it looks like it does
have much shimmer in it but it actually
does a more buff it in I'm seeing a
little bit of shimmer peeking through I
wouldn't really contour with this
product this is more of a bronzing of
the skin products because of the shimmer
in it I don't think you're going to get
the contour look that you might want out
of it so kind of having a hard time
getting it blended it's just looking a
little muddy right here this side looks
nice and soft but I don't know why this
side isn't maybe it's my skin I don't
know but I mean I don't hate the bronzer
I like it I'm going to be obsessed with
it but I like it so far I'm going to
grab our two brush and go in with a
nother baked product this one is in
shade at 305 and it is a blush and it's
like a pretty berry color Oh a lot came
off on my brush oh very pigmented very
pigmented
that's pretty I like the blush it's
really pretty but it's very berry huh
whoa so whenever I get too much blush I
go back in with my powder brush and just
Swizzle that on out girl Franks I don't
like a lot of blush most you guys
already know that to tell you these
things next up I have the troublin it
says new on the package don't know if
it's new it's not it's not if it is it
is what as anyway this is in number one
I think this is a cream like contour and
highlight because I don't have a
highlight on deck I'm gonna go ahead and
use this guy right here I'm actually
just going to dampen this Beauty Blender
a little bit and I'm going to dab it on
into the highlight and then we're going
to see what happens
the highlight is pretty but it's very
subtle in reality I would probably now
see that's pretty it's just subtle
reality I might for myself would add a
little more of a powder highlight right
on top but yeah if you're not sure like
how I use cream products you go with a
damp Beauty Blender or you can dampen it
with a setting spray of your choice and
just kind of use it like that it's
really pretty though hmm
so if you would like to try out
something a little natural a little soft
from the drugstore but very pretty and
because this is cream and not powdery I
find it doesn't pick up that much
texture on the skin so I think I like
this a lot you know it probably won't be
my everyday product just because I
typically go for a blinding highlight
but it's nice now I'm going to add some
setting spray my pin and then I take the
side of the Beauty Blender and Pat
everything out so we don't look too
powdery still loving the foundation I
just like the way the overall look looks
that make sense
okay something else I picked up that's
new is the katie-cat pearl there's two
of them I was only able to find one of
them from my drugstore and it's like
this cream eyeshadow I definitely want
to use it and I try to think right now
my girl how you want to use this though
I don't know mommy sighs why not play
with the nudes palette as well this was
brand new ochre I've had to sell it for
a long time girl get out of here so I
kind of play with the colorful one a
little bit mmm that is a really creamy
pigmented little booger so I'm going to
start off with this thingy my Baba right
here what am I trying to say yeah I'm
gonna stop with this pretty color right
here these a white 18 brush
and now I'm going to go into this pallet
and actually take this brown color right
here because we need to deepen up the
crease just a little bit so I'm just
going to pop this right on top of the
other color so they're closed a little
bit light or lighter than I thought for
whatever reasons
products are okay like the eyeshadows
there's not that pigmented I'm not
getting like I'm sure the shimmers are
right now I'm using the map and like the
more I blend them the more they
disappear into my eyes I'm not actually
that obsessed but they're not the end of
the world you know they're not that bad
I'm just not living and breathing for
them over here I have all three of omens
maybe I'll just take like a smidge of
this darker deep brown color and blend
that right into the crease cuz I really
wanted to deep with the crease now I'm
officially going to try this little guy
out right here onto my eyelid this one
is in shade Tiger rose and I'm just
going to apply this cream shadow um
across my lid it feels really nice it's
just super subtle it's not that sticky
either so that's good so these are
pretty these are super easy item to use
if you just want to be like a
one-and-done and pop this on your eyelid
and roll with it
I like that they dry really fast so
you're not left with a lot of creasing
on the eyelid
pretty cool product to enhance my eye
look I'm going to go in with this shade
right here this is a sigma e 58 brush
and I'm going to pack this right on top
of that cream product so it sticks and
really enhances the eyeshadow look I'm
going to grab at this light shade and
I'm going to pop that right there in the
inner corner like so and then you can
even take just a little bit of it
and add it right onto the brow bone I'm
going to take a r39 brush in the purple
shade and I'm actually going to buff
this on the outer corner cuz I'm add
some color for my life
these shimmers are so pigmented I cannot
say the same for the matte like you have
to give them a little bit more work you
just get a finagle them a little more
but they're not bad like I think these
palettes are worth the money it's just
going to work out the shimmers are worth
it you know I like to keep this on the
outer corner and then right there in the
center I just softly buff back and forth
to blend that out I'm just going to grab
like a tiny bit of that dark brown color
again
and I really want to deepen up that
alder be
I'm going to top-line with just a little
bit of liner and I'm going to like
budget right in that alright now I'm
going to try out the total tees mascara
this is a brand new mascara and it has
this weird rigid top and then it has
this weird pokey bottom I think the
little edge is for your bottom lashes
and then the other is to build up the
top lashes so we're going to see what
it's got I will be adding palsies but
first I'm gonna build this up and see a
little review on it this little edge
this little end piece like it's about to
touch my eye and it's freaking me out
mmm Oh a spider Lee lash moment but this
is not a bad mascara like you can
actually see my lashes and I have really
pitiful lashes that's pretty good not
mad at it so I think that this is a
really pretty mascara I think you get a
crapload of product on the one so like
the mascara builds up the lashes really
quickly and leaves them kind of spidery
my lashes kind of grow downward if
you're wondering but if you like the
thicker lashes and the really build up
lashes you'll like this mascara for sure
I'm going to wait for this to dry and
then I'm going to brush it away I'm
going to take the 2 Brown colors out of
this palette and bust them on my lower
lash line I'm just going to use this Mac
Mariah Carey brush to do so and of
course I'm going to go in with a little
bit of this purple and the same a little
buffer brush I'm just going to add some
purple as well and I'm going to connect
them right there in the outer corner and
just like blow that out just a little
bit
alright I'm kind of nervous I'm going to
try the odd in this mascara like okay I
had to do it like really close familiar
but I actually don't like that and does
mascara at all it like doesn't do
anything from a bottom lashes so we're
just going to flip the brush over and
use this thicker edge for the bottom
lashes and I think they look pretty darn
good
snazzy all right so they came out with
these cool black Katy Perry at tubes and
I'm going to Chavez new color is nice
called blue to full kitty it's kind of
like a sheer patchy blue
which I'm not living for because you can
layer it out that six super streaky and
patchy the blue color so not really
obsessing over that it is going to be
like a bold color I put a pigment to be
as even as possible so it's not like
crazy looking we're gonna try out the
red color for you
this color is really pretty and alright
I add a few layers that it is still a
little bit streaky it seems to be doing
a little bit better than the blue and
this color is called ready to pounce and
then we have a poor cat which is
definitely the prettiest it just edged
shimmer it's like a pretty peachy
shimmer color I don't hate it I kind of
love it but I'm actually not going to
wear today I just went to first
impressions and shown to you because it
doesn't match my eyes look look so ever
so I'll probably put on a different
Lissy just because those are like crazy
off ah all right guys I added some
bigger lashes because you know why I
love my drama these are icon lashes I
think jealousy yeah these are jealousy
of everything linked down below
oh this video was good and so far I am
still loving the foundation and the
highlight oh it's looking really pretty
I'm pretty much there's something that I
honestly hated which is great I haven't
had the best run in the world with
covergirl products but these newer ones
seem to work out fantastic well not
fantastic but you know pretty darn good
the lipstick sir don't forget to comment
