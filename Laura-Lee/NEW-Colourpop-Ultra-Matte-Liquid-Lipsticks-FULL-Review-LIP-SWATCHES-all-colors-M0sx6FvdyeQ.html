video is going to be on new colour-pop
ultra matte liquid lipsticks I'm on a
whole nother level of excited to share
this with you guys oh my no wait
we company colors there are my lips look
like they kind of have a pink ring room
and that's cuz they're pure raw because
I did let's watch all of them for you
you're gonna see it in this video I'm
going to review mime gonna let you know
the good in the back part my favorite
colors we're going to go over all of
them if you want to see that stick
around don't forget to subscribe before
you leave and we're going to jump right
in and get started
Oh tile is being blood red and looking
like they're about to bleed oh I want to
talk about the lip colors individually
but first I want to kind of give you an
overall review and my thoughts upon them
I think they are great they are six
dollars apiece they do not ship to the
UK yet oh I know I just stabbed you in
the heart
I'm so sorry I did talk to the girls
there they were working so hard on
getting the product shipped over to the
UK it is not happening yet they don't
know when it's going to happen you have
to understand it's not just a contractor
alright this shipping company can ship
it right over there and there we go it's
what that country will allow in the
country as far as the formula of their
product yada yada yada product has to be
a little bit different something like
that I don't know all the works in it
I'm not in shipping business okay are
working on that there are 25 change
right now
they're working on even more shades what
I don't understand how they can come up
with more shades than this but they are
in the works of doing that want it to
wait to all the shades around to release
them but they couldn't wait any longer
and thank God because I mean we we need
to get started on these these are
beautiful they launched today
hey this day right now this day they're
launched they are now launched I love
liquid lipsticks I love pigna on my lips
if you have been with my channel for a
hot minute you know this girl right here
though some color but even if you don't
the nude selection is
I mean it's there I do think the colors
they are drying I haven't found a liquid
lipstick that is not dry so your lips
need to be pre moisturized before you
apply them I do apply these on my lips
with no other product just on my bare
lips you do need to make sure you're
exfoliating your lips before you apply
any liquid lipstick especially these
because any little piece of skin or any
crusty crust on your lip is going to
show through big time so just be sure
your lips are nice and smooth and don't
say I didn't warn ya because I just told
you make sure lips are licensed move
their manufacturing warehouse is
actually in Los Angeles I believe I
think so so it's a United States product
likes either six dollars a piece on a
Tashia liquid lipsticks or 2.3 grams you
get the exact same amount of product so
just to give you a size reference here
it's almost it's like tomb it's just a
little bit longer than the Honest
Austria liquid lipsticks but you
actually get the exact same amount of
product I just think their wand is a
little bit longer you come with each for
the doe foot applicator it makes them
pretty easy to apply for me I do like to
do the applicator especially whenever
it's not a big spongy one this one is
quite stiff so for me the stiffer the
applicator with a liquid lipstick it's
easier to apply that's just my opinion
as that it's not fast please do crack a
little bit I have found a way around the
cracking that works for me if you put
one thin layer of the liquid lipstick on
your lips
they will not crack I have no problem
with the cracking they go on smooth it
works out perfectly if you put a layer
and then add maybe another layer just
for like more color whatever you're
doing they're probably going to crack I
hate to say I have majority of liquid
lipsticks do in some ways crack on me
not all of them these do crack but that
is my method of getting around them from
cracking is to do one small layer if you
look into my lip swatches that you're
going to see you'll see that they didn't
crack and that's because I have
one thin layer of each liquid lipstick
on my lip
during the lip swatches so just so you
know I have one thin layer on now I'm
going to talk to you guys about each
color and just let you know my opinion
on it
the first color is vice it is incredibly
incredibly a new color like it's like
super mood honestly vice is too light
for me to wear because the color of my
skin is a little bit too dark just comes
off too light on me and it doesn't
really work out however I do mix guys
with a little bit of brown color and
just put it in the center of my lips it
works out beautifully excuse myself home
because I want to talk about is shimmy
now this is the color that's more so up
my alley this is a very pink nude and
this one is a little bit more wearable
for me because that has a little bit
more color to the newness I do wear
shimmy in the center mix with another
color I really wear a nude lipstick on
its own because that's just a preference
for me I don't like how I nude it out
your lips can be if you do girlfriend
you rock it to the cows come home
this one is you're getting into a light
pink and kind of out of the new category
we're still in a very neutral category I
think that this one's called solo solo
it's gonna be one of those colored I
honestly think would look good on any
one colored medium color dark color all
color has a yellow undertone has pink
undertone I think Hello would look good
on anybody so if you're kind of like I
don't know what to get it oh what looks
good on me try also love it good
everyday color the next one I talked to
talk to you guys about is MIDI now MIDI
reminds me a little bit of myth by Mac
which is a white nude color but MIDI
actually has a little bit of a brown
undertone within it so it's not going to
blank out your lips I think MIDI would
be so beautiful on a girl with light
skin I also think it would be pretty on
a girl with dark skin I'm just saying if
you're a girl with light skinny you have
a hard time rocking a nude
I think MIDI would be pretty because
it's not too too nude it has a little
bit of a mauve brown undertone the trap
is probably one of my favorites out of
all of them because it almost looks gray
which I know is weird but I like weird
stuff because I'm weird rock your
weirdness and I love the name of it trap
on my
crappy it's gray it's basically like a
purple gray color I would love to say it
is super mommy but it's leaning more
towards like a purple gray color once
you get it on your lips and looking at
your face you like that's great so I
like it I like great colors I think it
goes good with like a grunge Grant glam
look we're gonna jump into the pink
colors you're like we didn't just talk
about Pink's no we do not we are just
now getting into peace so we're first
we're gonna talk about donut what a cute
name
right Dona my favorite pink colors it is
definitely not a subtle pink color
whatsoever it's like panic like you can
see from back here pan I want to call it
Barbie pink because it's not hot pink
whatsoever but it's like bubblegum pink
it's like that poppy bubblegum pretty
pea color car space is more of the
Barbie doll pink color it just has a
pink with a slight purple undertone
which that just makes me think of Barbie
I know everybody has their own opinion
of what Barbies pink looks like the mine
first base it reminds me so much of a
girliest girl girl girl
Barbie color like this is girl world
right here I can't talk about seesaw
seesaw we're leaning towards more of a
purpley pink color like a little bit of
mom and gray with in it not going to be
for everyone and honestly seesaw doesn't
even look that great on me I think my
skin's a little bit too dark for right
now I think in the wintertime I could
probably pull it off more easily but I
think it's so pretty it is a standout
lip color because once you get it on
your list it almost looks like you're
wearing a light purple color we have a
neon pink color neon pink color is buzz
and this reminds me of candy yum yum by
Mac it's probably a dupe for kitty yum
yum by Mac because Kenny yom-yom is a
matte lip color as well as um hello our
ultra matte lipsticks liquid lipsticks
this is going to be your neon pink color
it's not subtle whatsoever
this one is hilarious and I love it so
much because it's hilarious this one is
like purple the name of this one
is Cola I think this one's called Cola
I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing it wrong
if not I know you guys will tell me in
the comments girl you were wrong this
one is neon purple like neon while egg
not me let me not say just neon purple
but neon Miley it is a neon light color
like you could say it's crazy it's crazy
it's insane the color and I love it so
much it's so wild so again this is one
of those out-of-the-box colors perfect
for summer and spring time but it's out
of the box
I wanna talk to you about is lychee
lychee is our it's not our darkest
purple that we have but it's our most
purple purple that we have it's not
maroon and it's not like purple it is
just that Crayola color purple and it is
wild and it is so much fun I love lychee
I love them all like I love the colors
and how bold they are I'll talk to you
about drivin which is probably one of
the most wearable purple colors that
they have um it's more like fuchsia
purple I think it's very wearable I
would wear this regularly like I
wouldn't wear this just for fun or out
on a crazy night like I would wear this
during the daytime as a fun purple color
okay this one is not one of my favorites
I probably won't be wearing this color
because it reminds me of my grandma's
nail polish but this one is Sunday and
it has an iridescent shine to it I don't
know what it is about it it's just a
rare color that I'm not obsessed with
has a weird tint to it but this is
Sunday but you may love it so everybody
has your own opinion on stuff just
reminds me of a grandma's nail polish
and I can't get that out of my head I'm
sorry
color is a color that me personally I
would wear any day of the week this is
called high ball so high ball is your
typical hot pink color it's not neon
pink it's not Barbie got pink don't get
those two confused it is hot pink any
time I wear pinky promise by those two
colors people ask me what I have on list
it on my lips
this looks exactly like pinky promise my
dose of colors desert colors it like I
love so much I love coral I this is
specific and I just think that's such a
great never
this color and I don't know why you
would think Pacific Blue is something no
I love Pacific so this one is just pure
coral yes it has some orange undertone
to it but any coral that color does I
love the color coral so now I'm going to
talk about this color this color is
called zipper this is purple purple
purple but this one is a darker purple
and actually transfers so dark
from a distance it almost looks like
you're wearing a black to a maroon color
Lippe
looks like it looks a wee bit darker
than it does in the package and I will
let you know that you have to be careful
when applying the darker or liquid
lipsticks because doing one thin coat
you want to make sure that one thing
coat is super even or else they get
patchy weird you have to be more careful
when applying these with their dark
colors like this zipper was a little bit
more difficult for me to apply Ã¸g Ã¸g
porgy no not orgy right so this one is a
pink color but it little it's like an
orange red is what I want to call it
it's not that just I don't even know
that I mean I guess I would call it pink
but it's leaning on the side of red but
it's not quite red enough to be red it
looks like kind of like relentlessly red
by Mac as like a coral Lee red to it
it's a really pretty really well at
wearable color next I'll talk to you
guys about succulent we're getting more
into the Reds this one is a lighter red
color it's not going to be the blue
toned red color it's Stefan going to be
a more warm tone red color on the blade
homework red card we'll get into just a
minute but the warm warm tone of a red
color I think it's beautiful for more of
a summertime red color lips next I'll
talk to you about the blue tone red one
this was a little bit of a darker red
this red is going to make your teeth
look super duper duper super duper duper
duper white I mean while lip swatching
all these I put this on my lips now it's
like hot dog did Mike just get water and
then I was like oh yeah I'm using a blue
tone red that's exactly what this is
this one's called creeper and this one
probably has the favorite name out of
all of them creeper like that is
everything creeper
next I'll talk to you guys about Mars
ours is very close to highball but hi Bo
and you can see is a good bit lighter
Mars is like a darker fuchsia color
depends on how dark or light you like
your fuchsia color to be I would wear
either of these I mean I wouldn't even
get picky with it because they're so
close in color but Mars dishes darker
than highball but they're both a
beautiful fuchsia pink color if you want
to talk about and we're gonna go over
all the brown colors so I adore these
brown colors these are your these are
going to be the fall colors I'll
actually talk about the darkest one and
I had a whole of trouble getting this
one to apply evenly I hope you can't
tell it looks large but you might be
able to tell the lip swatch if you can't
tell please do not let me know in the
comments just be like on you did a good
job girl you did a good job because my
lips are swollen right now oh this one
is lax I mean what a great name right
although I hate lax because the traffic
makes me want to stab someone in the
airport one is a dark dark dark brown
color it may have a little bit of a red
tone but once you get it on your lips
you can't see that whatsoever
it does eight transfers so dark so this
is going to be this is the darkest one
out of all of them I'll talk to you guys
about limbo limo is just your brown
brown brown brown brown brown like this
looks like the Crayola color brown
there's no other way to describe limbo
it is super Brown and it transfers to
this is that color
SuperDuper Brown again it's a darker one
I had a little bit of trouble getting it
to apply evenly mumble is a spicy Brown
color it reminds me just a little bit of
the Gerard's 1995 liquid lipstick with
everything not liquid lipstick regular
lipstick which kind of took over the
world whenever that was like Jacqueline
Hills first lipstick she came out with
this reminds me a little bit of that has
that spicy Brown to it next when I'll
talk to you about is Tully and you may
be like gosh they're so similar but
they're really not that similar at all
what's there right up next to each other
Tully is like ten shades darker then
bumble I think bumble is going to be way
more wearable but again it all depends
on what you like to wear it's all about
what you like not just what I'm saying
I'm just letting you know and this is
more of a neutral color rather than to
Lee and you'd probably get more we're at
a bumble if you're a neutral ygal and
you don't like crazy dark colors yes
sorry my boys kept super Scratchy at the
end of this I had to talk a lot and
wanted to go over them also just ask me
I'll talk about Avenue Avenue is brick
red it looks maroon and again this one
is super super dark but I didn't have
trouble applying it so it applied really
evenly it is extremely dark it is
extremely bold I will wear this color
like every single day of all time that
is it for this video also I wanted to
let you guys know my friend yet me
channel is called Beauty bird she is
doing it video that's gonna be so fun
involving these she's gonna be lips
washing them all and the video is gonna
be super fun to watch I think if you

out so much and picking out which shade
is gonna be right for you you're
actually gonna be able to really see
them on her lip she's going to be doing
close-ups and all that jazz she's gonna
lip swatch every single color she's
gonna kind of you know I didn't want the
review part of it she's going to do more
of them showing them on the lips and I
feel like that's really going to help
you guys pick exactly which color you're
looking for I hope I answered all your
questions on these by going over all of
these let me know down in the comments
that you have more questions on them
I'll be happy to issue them you guys
