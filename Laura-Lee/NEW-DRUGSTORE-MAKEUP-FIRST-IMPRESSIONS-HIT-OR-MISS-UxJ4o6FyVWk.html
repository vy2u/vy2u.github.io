have a cardboard cutout of myself and I
don't hate it oh my hair is being so
crazy today and there's nothing I can do
about it okay
it just took a vacation to Bora Bora and
now wants to misbehave I don't know what
to do about it
today's video I went to CBS actually and
picked up a bunch of new products you
want to something really cool about the
CBS I go to the one I go to in LA a
subscriber of mine works the makeup
section and it's really cool because
every time I see her either you're like
hey girl
housewife what's going on it's just so
cool like a lordly and we just like talk
and chat about makeup every time I get
to go there just honestly kind like a
pleasure I'm like anyways I went to CVS
and I there was so much new makeup
actually I did I have to admit I'm gonna
use this really beautiful palette I
found that alter this one I found that
alter not CVS but a few things I found
also is new Joe store makeup and I think
it's just time that we do our first
impressions with drugstore makeup we
haven't done that in a minute on my
channel so I wanted to do that and share
with you my thoughts they'll probably be
some hits and misses because I have some
different items in the mix but yeah I'm
really excited to test out these
products I hope you're excited to see
about them and um I need ice water how
old is this before we get started let's
go ahead and sing a little jingle in
subscribe and like this video
oh go ahead and jump right into the
video
all joking aside the hair it's going up
I'm actually had to put a little bit
moisture on my skin really quick she's
dry
not a little serum hydration oh and
Abbas it it literally whenever I was
filming videos before I left I had a zit
like up here right there and then it
just migrated right on down so that's
great I'm really excited about that
let's go ahead and get started
I have to admit this product isn't new
but there weren't really any new
drugstore primers so I thought I would
try one I've never tried before on my
channel and we would experience it
together if you have any thoughts on
this I'm trying finish let me know your
thoughts down in the comment section
this is the honeydew me up by NYX
Cosmetics and it has golden flakes in it
and it reminds me a little bit of the
Wyatt cell one with the golden flakes
which I love that primer a lot I think
even has a little spatula in there oh
yeah it definitely feels more serum like
oh my god look it's like stringing
everywhere why is this probably not a
facial primer it's like very boobie
googy it's very gooey it feels like I'm
putting snot on my skin but I'm not mad
at that
okay so that was that I don't know why I
put on my face a new foundation try you
guys are just gonna slap me through the
camera wash when I use one of my
favorite drugstore foundations this is
the Milani
perfecting conceal shade number five I'm
just gonna use this on my skin today I
have my mirror over here we need to move
it over I'm gonna take none other than
the y6 from morphe brushes to blend out
my foundation you guys know this is my
favorite foundation brush and it's
finally back in stock a Murphy's website
I'm like oh my gosh
but wait was long and you guys are just
gonna sell it out again but just let you
know it is back in stock and just ah
salute you know this color is too light
for my skin now cool we're gonna switch
to shade 7 sand cuz my face is a little
bit lighter those in my body and that's
because I use so much sunscreen um even
though my face still got some Sun
but I still love the sunscreen oh that's
it on my forehead it hurts so bad like
every time the brush touches it I just
my scream it's like one of those really
painful under the skins it's there maybe
TMI for some people who are like okay we
don't need to hear all the details but
you know I'm gonna give it to you if I
get is it it's like you know it's gonna
be like the most painful under the skin
thing that lasts a week like you can't
just be like a little blemish that pops
up and runs away like it's gonna be here
to stay for a minute so we have our
foundation on and next for concealer the
kooky cosmetics this is kind of a new of
incoming drugstore brand and this is be
bright actually thinking found this one
at Ulta as well I have its shade and
golden tan which is why is why is it
looks it looks so like yeah like golden
tan I was like no I think cuz normally I
wear a shade light in concealers to
highlight as well as conceal but I was
like looking at the bottle I was like
I'm gonna do going Dan we're gonna go
ahead and highlight and I normally just
use my y6 to blend out the cream product
as well just as a good job of moving
around the cream product this y6 is
filthy but mm-hmm
and let me tell you a little T on this
kooky cosmetics this looks so pretty on
the skin not only that I tested this out
whenever I was filming with Tati and she
was like this is really good so I tested
it out and I kind of live for it so I'm
excited to be trying it out on my own
channel and it is I know that was like a
month ago or so but it is just really
beautiful and I'm digging it I'm going
to try out the fit me loose finishing
powder I have shade light 15 right here
really excited about this I feel like
the drugstore has so many slim pickings
whenever it comes to a good loose powder
that doesn't flash back it's not too
translucent however this one's looking a
little Tang in I might be using the
shape of it here oh that's darker light
where luckily I picked up the shade at
fair as well so I have at the powder in
here I'm just going to take a Beauty
Blender and get some on there and then
I'm going to press it Archer will bake
today
I don't always bake I more so just like
apply powder um sometimes baking can be
a little bit heavy
you know improv baking and normally what
I've been doing lately is while my skin
isn't baking I'll actually go ahead and
apply my bronzer because this area is
still ready for powder to apply in that
way the baking can be setting there's
just a little tip to get your makeup
done faster this is the Rimmel natural
bronze waterproof bronzing powder and
these are super affordable I haven't
really tried this one it has I golden
hue this one's into sunshine I'm gonna
take an m5 8:1 brush and swirl it lots
of product very pink looking though it's
kind of pinky huh let's see what it
looks like on the skin it's not so bad
that's pretty you guys know the butter
brats are by physicians formula is
normally my drugstore jam whenever it
comes to jokes or bronzers I also found
that covergirl one that I mentioned
recently my favorites that I've really
been enjoying but gone oh this has a lot
of gold and sparkle to it which is
really beautiful but I'm all for the
bronze this is really pretty on the skin
I'm something else that really I'm
enjoying about it I said it's not patchy
at all like it's pretty subtle but it's
not patchy whatsoever I would say this
is a warmer bronzer so if you have a
more fair skin tone maybe go in with a
lighter hand with it but I think it's
really beautiful I'm gonna take my e41
brush and sweep away this powder oh it
looks so velvety just letting you guys
get it close up
I think the powder looks pretty good the
NRI is not too Creasy I get just a
couple creases no matter what concealer
I use but it looks pretty nice actually
we have good coverage we have two new
blushes from Elm a I know I don't talk
about this brand on my channel that much
because sometimes their products don't
excite me per se I'm as much as like
Revlon or Maybelline covergirl who are
always coming out with really cool stuff
so I want to dabble in some ma and these
looked really pretty so I have two
powder blushes from them that are new
this one's called
oh these are smart shade brush blushes
too so this one is coral and this one is
pink pretty simple names as you guys
know I'm gonna go for the coral that's
like my favorite when it comes to
blushes okay so I get it it's got like
matte and shimmer I'm gonna mix it all
together and apply it to my face okay
white for brush I'm just gonna tap
around it you ever get too much on your
brush you can obviously tap or hit it on
the hand and it will take away the
excess
it's pretty I think it's a subtle blush
I think because I actually am getting
loads on my black brush cuz I like got
some on there I was like wow that's too
much then it took me like three swipes
to build it up to here so I think it's a
pretty subtle blush but easy to use and
I like it also from Elm a so I have the
new wet and wild really cool
highlighters that of course I'm gonna be
trying out I also have this weird
rainbow highlighter and I also have this
freakin pen highlighter why do I have
three hands I don't know so this is a
highlighter duo this one is a nude glow
about all May so one side you twist
hmmm and the other side is a stick
my thoughts are ready that this doesn't
even look that glowy it looks almost
like nothing but the stick side however
looks really glowy do you see how like
this is like almost like matte looking I
don't really like that liquid side with
a stick okay is apply that is crazy
that's kind of hard to get blown dead
though oh but then when you blows away
it's a little difficult to work with
because it is a cream a highlight and
once you blend it you really don't get
it like a crazy blinding highlight but
it's pretty it's subtle it's comfortable
I don't like the liquid side on these so
I'm actually not gonna recommend these
to you because I don't feel like it'd be
worth your money for me just personal
preference I like a little bit more of a
blinding highlight so with that being
said I think we should try out some of
the new wet and wild highlights which
you guys already know I'm kind of a
sucker for like these they came out with
the goal of the battle one and I just
lived a breathe and died for it okay
this one is bow Tanic dream it's like a
pinky one that we're gonna test have my
r36 brush I'm just going it to swipe it
they also look kind of do a chrome or
arid essent you get a lot of product off
the brush just like there are other ones
I don't want always whisper like I
haven't tried that gold flout golden
flower crown this is more like golden
one I should probably go ahead and just
to even things out put some of the pink
on this side so we don't look just uh
this one looks to die for it also looks
like a golden duochrome moment okay
lastly I have to put on this lavender
shade has a lot of Fallout but sometimes
I don't mind the fallout as much if it's
not - girl why is this necklace doing oh
this lavender yes good only half delay
we have to see the tea on this way but
one are you guys ready for this you know
what I'll try us out at the end of the
video and I will put it on my face ah
it's magic she has aa crown now I'm
going to use this perfect color palette
it's kind of sort of beautiful hello
from NYX rustic antique is the name of
this one snapchat fam knows about this
it's not going in the trash snapchat fam
knows we are going to take this really
light shade and it's like a little bit
of a tan I'm gonna use a 5 7 3 brush I'm
just going to flicker the shade like and
then buff it on the outer corner just
like that I'm gonna take a r39 brush
next in this shade like bronze with a
little bit of sparkle to it so I get
some on one side of my brush instead of
both sides and then flip the brush
upward this brush is a little bit more
dense and it's a little more sleek so
that the rich color doesn't explode
everywhere I really have been enjoying
it NYX eyeshadows lately it's like what
I've been getting into and I think
they're great so I'm excited to be using
some more of them I know I just talked
about their ultimate palettes and my
favorites so I'm focusing this color on
the outer corner it's super fiery it
didn't really look that fiery
in the packaging but once I bust into it
you really can't see the golden sparkle
on it which is totally okay with me I
think it's pretty in the palette I think
it's just more for show once you bust in
the color like it's super warm I'm gonna
go in with this deeper cranberry shade
with the same brush and we're really
gonna deepen up that outer corner I try
to get mostly the product on the tip of
the brush and then I try to like flicker
it in that little crease EP right there
we'll take it back and forth being sure
just not to disperse the color too much
because we don't want an explosion of
this deep cranberry color across our eye
so I try to keep it tighter onto the
eyelid you can also take a clean
blending brush and there's really soften
up those edges to make sure everything's
really gradient and there's no harsh
lines going on I'm gonna take an M 210
brush in this shimmery color and put it
on the brow bone and the inner corner
I'm gonna take this golden color right
here on my finger I'm gonna pack it on
right there in the center it's so pretty
I'm gonna take this brown shade right
here going back to my r39 brush scooping
up some on the tip of the brush
I'm gonna grab an M 408 brush I'm gonna
take this warm color that we took in the
beginning and just buff it right across
that lower lash line keeping it kind of
close to the lashes and I'm going to
take the maroon II shade right here with
the same brush and do the same thing
just buff it along of this new liner
from Maybelline it's called curva tude
and it has like this weird I've been to
it and then oh you spin the lid off it's
like a pin I'm not normally like it's
not like pin liners just aren't my thing
it's more like the brush tip liners are
my thing but I'm gonna give it a try for
you guys because this is a brand new
product that just came out and let's see
if we destroy our eye look or not with
it like honestly it's probably one of
the most pigmented pin liners I feel
like I've ever used okay so I'm gonna
flip it back and try to take the wing
back with it I mean this is it my
favorite wing ever but I don't hate it
because I feel like I didn't have to go
over 25,000 times with it
so that was nice let's see if it dries
super matte or not that's another big
thing I'm a stickler for um it dries too
shiny for me so I don't like the formula
of it because of them just like a super
matte girl that's a personal preference
but the liner itself I can't find the
lid I don't hate it it's like one of the
most inky and pigmented black liners
ever so it's a good job overall I think
it was a little bit difficult for me to
create a wing with it but not too bad
I'm gonna throw in some mascara and
lashes and I'll be right back the last
thing we have to test out is some new
colors of the Revlon Ultra HD matte lip
colors I really have enjoyed these in
the past obviously object for more nudie
patooty tubes oh my gosh this color it's
like sparkle I thought this was like
wait smells good she smells like
strawberries and watermelon so this one
is HD flare I don't know if you can see
it has a little
sparkles in it but it's like Oh metallic
okay I'm gonna try all this purple one
willows they're really comfortable
I think it's really pretty it's quite
subtle compared to what comes in the
packaging and they're really sparkly so
I don't hate it and now I have a blue
one this one is called glitz so let's
see what the little say
let's you have to like work to get it
even I don't even think it's even right
now but it's kind of cool it's like a
mermaid duochrome moment so these are
our new lippies ok guys this is our
final look what do you guys think we
definitely have some hits and misses I
think that the primer and powder and
concealer and we're really well
surprised that these didn't have that
much pigment I really like the
highlights I didn't like the all my
highlights the curvy liner it's pretty
but I did go a little bit over it with
some at lighter liquid to cover my lash
band and kind of covered it the bronzer
was great I'm the eyeshadow palette was
phenomenal it looks so pretty on the
eyes so some hits and this is there and
these were pretty cool so that's that's
my little overall rundown on the
products I hope you guys enjoyed the
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel before you leave and I'll see
you in my next video I adore you guys I
love you guys so much
oh you thought I forgot I don't forget
here it is so I'm just gonna oh that's
pretty
oh my gosh oh my why do I like this I
could be blood them all together you
almost get like a really white blinding
highlight with a blue and yellow hue to
it it's not as bad as I thought was
gonna be it's a little like my skin tone
I should see my cheeks hurt looking ashy
but oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
