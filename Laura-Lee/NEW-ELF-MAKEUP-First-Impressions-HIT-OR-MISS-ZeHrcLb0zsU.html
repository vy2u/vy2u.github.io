video is going to be a testing out new
products emelles I recently went on
their website and just went under the
new arrivals and there were a bunch of
products I even test out the new
foundation from ELF I think its new it's
called flawless finish foundation I feel
like that foundation has been out for a
minute and I'm just now trying it but it
was under the new section on the page so
I don't know I might be wrong but I just
go by what the website tells me and I
buy it and I review it for you guys so I
hope you guys enjoyed that and I think
it's really cool to find hit products
for an affordable price I will go ahead
let you know there are some misses in
this video but there also were some hits
so stay tuned to find out more anyways
we're going to jump right into the video
and hope you guys enjoy it I love when I
try to wink wink both eyes I'm like this
it's a good week right okay let's do the
video i jumping right in guys i'm going
to start out with a little sample that I
got of some mineral infused face primer
with my order I did not see this on the
website but I mean it came to order so I
figure why not test it out right if you
look at the primer kind of as me of
these Smashbox so oh it feels so soft
and I mean it still silicone II but it
feels like way more than just silicone
II it feels like a bit moisturizing as
well like it feels like there's some
more I don't know it feels nice Danny to
buy this primer now okay I see what you
did there else you got me sometimes
silicone II primers I gets kept cool
with oily skin but I know this one feels
super good okay here's the thing online
the foundation shades looked way darker
so I got shade sand and I also got shade
natural but now they look super light
that I have them in person so this is
supposed to be like a new foundation I
believe it has a nice little pump on it
come on guys that is going to be 50
shades way too light for me and that
makes me so mad because the shape looks
so different online alright here's what
we're going to do by the way this is
called the flawless finish
datian it looks super thick and
luxurious on my hand but I might apply
this to my face until you guys at my
first impression and the feels ease oh
it's like super nice and creamy I'm
going to have to add in a little bit of
another foundation but for the sakes of
the first impressions of this I'm going
to go ahead and one this out and give
you my car how about I'm going to be
using my wife six brush from morphe to
blend this out girl let me get it closer
mirror rain oh yeah that looks kind of
ashy right through here the foundation
as is adhering to my skin it feels like
a luxury foundation like right off the
bat and the shades are just like
honestly they run light and I never can
wear shade like sand or anything like
that and I wants any brand that this
London girl what is this what is this
situation get out of here I would say
medium coverage medium to light coverage
as you can see still see a lot of press
linger here but it does have a really
pretty finish it's not a very matte
finish is very natural finish it feels
like a super nice foundation so I'm
going to reorder my my mama a little I'm
going to reorder my color which I'm
going to get way darker than I normally
would I'm going to add just a little bit
of my foundation another foundation on
top of dishes so I don't look way off in
this whole video so the sad part is I'm
pretty excited about that foundation
actually I've never felt an elf's
foundation that felt that nice thick and
creamy and just kind of luxurious
honestly
unfortunately the shade obviously did
not work out exactly so I had a touch of
my own foundation but as far as the
product and first impressions I liked it
because my brain is so scatterbrain as
always I kind of sort of forgot to tell
you guys about this so this is
illuminating moisturizer with SPF 15 so
it's a good day to have moisturizer with
the sun protection but I didn't put it
on my face because I thought it was
skews a foundation so much because of
how much pigmentation and health 6 and
moisturizer was I really thought it
the test of the foundation honey I don't
know about this it's like a creamy thick
moisturizer it could be nice for night
time it's just so sick I would hate for
it to make my skin super greasy looking
or shiny and me say the foundation maybe
my skin like that it smells kind of
sunscreen it so it's kind of nice so I
want to let you guys know about it and I
let you know my thoughts on the actual
product and as you can see the back of
my hand is like super luminous so it
does what it says I just think it's a
little bit thick to wear underneath
makeup especially with me testing out
makeup and like mess up the whole
shebang whew okay next up I have a new
brow wax from ELF and it looks like this
I kind of feel like I should fill in my
brows a little bit and then apply the
wax over now I'm just gonna apply the
wax girl we going in today we're armed
all my fully here's one comb these brown
is it weird that I put on my brow oh
this is a lot of product this wax is
something thick is it strange that put
on my brows every day and honestly let
me just go this brush is just way too
big to get a precise brow out of it I
just put some on an angled brush more
and try it out like that because the
actual product is just a lot coming from
the tube and actually you guys have
suggested me in the past hour try out
brow products I mean I personally don't
like to do this like this just takes up
too much time to me and I already have
to take 50 years to do my eyebrows so
but you know if you really want to make
it work or like have this affordable
product on today this is an option dead
serious is too waxy and it makes my
eyebrows look shiny rather than like a
natural brow it's like too much
happening no I don't like this product
so I got it I feel like my brow is like
so stuck down and waxy and patchy girls
now
okay I filled in my brows and I combed
out some of the wax right through here
you still kind of shiny so I'm not
loving that but we will move right along
next up I got a shadow log eyeshadow
primer from ELF it says new on it so it
must be new I've never used I don't
think I've ever used I've used the elf
glitter primer which is nice I never use
like the eyeshadow primer so let's see
what this business is all about it is
white and lotion filling I hope this
works because I always use my Mac Paint
Pot and soft ochre and that's my
ride-or-die but today I'm switching it
up for you guys this is shininess I'm
like always skeptical about the liquidy
primers you know some works though the
Smashbox one is nice the Too Faced one
is nice as well my eyelids feel like I
put lotion on we'll see what happened
next I got this palette from ELF which
has eyes highlight blush and lips in it
I opened the name of the palette because
I took it out of this box and I'll
remember the name because you know I
just be doing stuff like that
neither the only eye shadows have to
play with today and honestly I'm super
interested to see if they're going to be
good oh because those are the only three
I chose I have today I'm going to you
know put on some of these as well this
is the new matte about you palette from
violet vault which is an all matte
eyeshadow palette so first I'm going to
take sweetheart which is a matte cream
color oh my god not realize this color
once is color this light I thought it
was going to be like a cream bone color
however it's coming off a little bit
lighter do you see how that primer makes
my eyes wet kind of is interesting okay
so I'm going to go in with infatuation
and mix these two together and this is
like normally sits a base for the primer
that I girl is this a first impressions
available powder would
but anyway so actually using this
palette gives it you can see them
playing in the colors and I've been
wearing it for like three days straight
and I love it it's heading use this
shade yet and it's obviously white and I
don't know why I think it was that white
next I'm going to go in with a little
bit minton which is a great transition
shade color and I'm just going to buff
it in and then I promise we're going to
get to do palette I know you guys are
like what is this Laura Lee what is this
business I'm going to take a more bm5
7-3 brush and go in with the middle
brown shade these are a little pants I'm
going to go ahead and tell you I'm not
obsessed whenever brands - lip pronto
that's pretty good segment ation I'm not
obsessed some brands put that's actually
really good um lip products mixed in
with powders because I find that it
literally only creates for a mess in the
pans like when the powder starts blowing
all over that is so pretty
starts boiling all over the lip products
do you love that I'm trying to review
this and I run my mouth at the same time
it's just really not working out so I'm
like saying three sentences into one oh
I don't know how you guys watch this
your brain is probably like I'm trying
okay but this eye shadow give it to me
yes yes yes there's food in my tooth I
need to call it quits today next I'm
going to go in with a shimmery brown
shade let's give us watch you before I
pop it onto my eyelid and like screw
everything up um pretty but pretty weak
pigmentation at the same time but still
pretty let's see what happens with the
brush to give it a fair shot I'm going
to wet it with Mac 6 plus because I wear
all my shadows with the Mac 6 plus and
that would just be shady it's me not to
and just like oh so it does it work you
can just wet it with water at home um
you know whatever you excuse me whatever
you like to do so you're going to make
me work for it hear me so bad honestly
these shimmers are not everything though
I can go ahead and tell you the elf has
got better shimmers in their Naked
palette and their sunset little
eyeshadow palette there are 10 bucks
that it's not great I mean it's not the
end of the world either for the price of
the palette but we're going to try out
the other things in the palette as well
I'm just having to work for it a little
bit and I've used some great old
eyeshadows so I expect nothing with the
best those are long and I'm going to add
a little bit of the light shade from the
palette look at the full I show brush
I've had a toucher brush for probably 10
years like literally 10 years I don't
even know where it came from and I've
been using it forever and a day so I
think it's so crazy that I still have it
I just thought in a little I should have
brushed pot and I was like go I'll do it
hanging out here I'm going to take them
Whoopie y22 brush okay that's pretty the
lightest shade here seems to have more
pigmentation looks pretty just popping
it on top honestly to give it a little
bit of a frosty and to lighten it up
okay this kind of see it's looking kind
of dusty not looking promising guys um I
should just put the shade on my brow
bone and not onto my lids I was trying
something out but it didn't really work
out oh this is all right you know you
guys are right they're not everything
about your chest they're nothing to call
home about but say all right next up
because I haven't set my face yet I'm
just going to move on to my face I'm
going to use the elf dark medium this is
a concealer stick it was in the new
section and oh this is the darkest one
medium dark nemesis's in the darkest why
I probably should have got the darkest
ones decisions looking like chocolate on
my face like caramel yeah I don't know
that this is even going to contour my
face I tried to snatch this little brush
up I mean it's doing a little something
I probably should've just got I just got
all messed up with shades honestly if
you don't want to be like me and get a
bunch of the wrong shades I recommend
that you just Google the shades or learn
from my experience in this video
honestly that was a very rich creamy
product to contour with I believe I use
when these before as a lightweight
contour stick so it is a contour Oh
lightweight concealer stick I'm just
seeing things
I'm just seeing what I want it to be I
think I use it as an under-eye concealer
in the past it was pretty terrible which
is like breezy and did not cover my dark
circles I bought the darker one to see
if it would work as a contour stick and
it actually blends out nice next
well is that it was new so the next I
got the contour palette it looks like
these are different shades and it's like
it's got some setting and highlighting
chase in the top as well so I'm just
going to mix the two Brown shades
together doop doop with my dirty dirty
morphe m 581 that's right brush just
going to sleep with the lighter one on
this side and it's actually really
pretty so that was really pretty I don't
have a new concealer so I'm just going
to all over my morphe oats a shade of
concealer and I'll be right back this is
a new finishing powder and I got the
shade a light fair so I could set my
under I can feel it and see how this
looks I'm going to San take this little
sponge dip it in there and just pack it
on and it seems to be a mattifying and
super yeah setting everything pretty
well I find that these little products
too are going to like throw in your
purse and if you get a little oily
they're out the day to take a little bit
of this and a sponge and just kind of oh
that powder is light so I also got this
amazing brush which feels like a luxury
brush my Daschle brush feels like so
light and kind of cheap but the actual
powder the actual bristles of the brush
tool and marvelous so I'm going to take
the brush and I use it right here into
this blush shade I'm pretty much always
had good luck with elf blushes this one
gets super matte pink I like column
palettes like this - like honestly the
pans I'm like hitting everything trying
to get a little bit of color out and it
just is a little bit annoying as you can
see it's already like blowing over into
the lip product which is it literally
put lip product this is exactly what I
was talking about this is why we don't
put enough addicts in our power next I'm
going it to take a little bit of the
highlight shade and if you can see like
a lot comes off watching it first it
pretty much feels in this
I mean this is to be a highlighter okay
there's like a white powder and I do not
like that at all
so this palette is super cute it's just
their pants are hard to get into the
highlight to know the I should have been
mediocre and the blush is nice and I
also like the eyeshadow primer I mean it
looks really pretty right now uh
highlight is it no for me so I'm
actually going to grab a little bit this
color pop highlight and just add it on
top to complete the look
oh my god I did not know my brush was
that loaded and I'm also not mad about
it but this highlight is on next level
well grind know what this is here's what
the palette looks like it does have a
name on it though
next up I got this new little shadow and
I went ahead and swatch this cream
shadow it looks super pretty and then
also comes with a liner on the end and
we're going to be using the liner edge
I'm going to go ahead and line my
waterline in my eyes
all right the liner on how to go over
like a hundred times with I think that
other pencil liner from else looks a
little bit better than this it's not the
worst in the world I just like my liner
to a super matte block and this one I
had to go over like a lot to get it
there I'm going to put the smoke color
of my waterline like a charcoal base
waterline gonna buff that out that I
chose really pretty
make sure you kind of like go under the
eye smoky wing with it
alright guys I added some lashes and
some lip ease and just let you know for
Lippe to add it jealousy and not the
right one charisma --them I don't know
how to pronounce this one also in the
description box below and just a heads
up of lashes I added House of lashes a
light iconic they're these and they are
just so pretty to me there's one of my
favorites so let's do a quick recap of
the hits and misses of the video within
the elf palette I think there were some
hits and misses in the palette I like to
powder the contour kit the contour
shades were nice and creamy they had a
lot of color I had the wrong shade in
the contour stick but I think it's a
nice spot to contour with I don't think
is
nice concealer product the foundation I
like to light just wish I had the right
shade so just be aware of that when
ordering it the shadow stick the liner I
honestly didn't really care for and then
the creamy eyeshadow on the end was
super cool and I liked it it worked out
well well says Hotel in the primer the
primer at the beginning I liked in the
eyeshadow primer I underestimated it you
know I'm not used to using cream primer
but I think it was really pretty on my
eyelids I just dropped the powder it's
probably broken great so yeah we have
some hitch we have some misses it's
always like that thank you guys so much
