- tapping noise going on do you hear it
that that that's you
it is me what am i tapping it's not me
not you No
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a first impression
makeup tutorial I'm going to continue
this series in trying out makeup threw
tutorial style I went on the elf website
and notice there was a crapload of new
products under like new arrivals or
whatever and it looked really cool so I
was like a Elsa such a great affordable
brand people ask me to use more
affordable makeup why not do a first
impressions with elf makeup so I bought
a bunch of this stuff and I'm going to
be testing it out in this video plus way
to makeup look came out and I hope you
do too
elf is such a great brand it's just
always so affordable and yeah of course
there are some hit and miss products but
that's with any brand it's just nice the
elves been around for so long and they
keep that low price point for everyone
whatever is getting into like the makeup
industry and YouTube and Instagram on
all that jazz I just had a regular
makeup back full makeup I didn't have
three Alex nine drawers full which I am
very blessed now to had that but
everytime I went to Target or CVS I
would just go pick out some elf products
because they were my go-to they were
affordable and it was things that I
could review and you know try out my
tutorials and over three years later
Here I am on YouTube still counting on
elf so I just think it's really awesome
that this brand is still around still
doing great things and I just want to
feel all that good stuff sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
we're gonna jump right in and test out
this makeup okay oh gosh starting out I
am using the beautifully bare
three-in-one makeup base from ELF this
is in shade clear ghost to help your
skin have a flawless finish so that's
the lid I thought it looks like it's
like a pump or something down in there
oh it's very it's not thin and it's very
thick and creamy I thought it was going
to be
and so I'm just going to massage that it
feels a little bit heavy but it feels
overall like a nice luxurious product on
my skin so I do like it so far
next up I'm going to be using the make
it forever ultra HD foundation this is
just one of my tried-and-true favorite
foundations and I don't have a new one
from ELF to try out so I'm just going to
be applying this to my skin skinny also
I'm going to be trying out this Beauty
Blender from ELF I have it dampened so
it's really big and it came in a three
pack with like a small medium and this
is the large one it feels a little bit
harder than the original Beauty Blender
but it feels very comparable and I think
the price point is so different upon the
original Beauty Blender and this you get
three of these that so far I'm feeling
like this is well worth the moolah like
this sponge is nice guys I'm going to be
trying out the beautifully bit the
beautifully bare lightweight concealer
stick and shade light fair fair light
looks like this it's like a little
chubby I will be honest with you I
normally don't care for concealer sticks
um this one seems to be pretty nice this
one is not like thin and greasy feeling
if you know what I mean it's a little
bit thicker filling so we'll blend it
out with a medium beauty blender now
it's so cute looks like mama and baby
oh this product is blending out pretty
easily this sponge is just as soft so I
do like it all right so it says
lightweight concealer stick it has very
light coverage because I still see a lot
of Darkness going on in my under eye
area so I'll probably apply a little bit
of extra let's stick into my dry skin um
a little bit extra concealer just to
make sure we have good coverage because
this is a very sheer coverage concealer
but I look for a little bit more of a
heavy coverage especially for like the
under-eye to get those dark circles next
up actually have their new cream contour
palette it looks like this it has a nice
gray undertone looking brown color which
I have my eye on it looks nice and I
yell Oh shade to highlight with
so I'm going to add that on top of the
concealer to see if we can't build up a
little more coverage and I've never
tried this palette out it was in the
light what's new section ooh I like this
much better than that oh yes yes Jesu
Islam looking form coverage so we'll
just keep tapping that out I like that
the highlight shade has a yellow
undertone
I am a yellow undertone that is nice
coverage now I'm going to go in with the
side of my sponge and this grayish brown
color mm-hmm you know so this cream
contour palette is really nice so far I
mean look it's just like blending out
nicely has good coverage to it cream
contouring makeup is a little bit
heavier than powder contouring so expect
it to be just a little bit more of I
don't want to say greasy or form of
makeup but it is going to be a heavier
for lack of better words cake here form
a makeup so I give this contour palette
a definitely yes I do recommend it it's
blending out easy it's got nice pigment
to it don't currently have a setting
powder for F so for F what for L so I'm
going to be using my next banana this is
our CC powder it's just like a loose
setting powder I'm just going to set my
under eyes this is an F 25 tapered face
brush from ELF what is wrong with me
today this brush is not from ELF you
guys are like liar his brush is from
Sigma and this is just one of my
all-time favorite makeup brushes from
Sigma so I have these natural little
brand new balls from ELF it's gonna come
out to be what I think a mineral powder
I just dropped one on this is the F 20
brush from Sigma I'm just going to apply
these all over my face they have a lot
of brown ones in here and I think
they're going to add some color to the
skin these are just like mineral balls
yeah I don't know why I have to say it
be immature when I say the word balls
these are very faint in color but I do
feel like you can definitely see like
when I dab the brush in them
that color comes off of them and I do
like the way they feel on the skin I
think because they're so light in color
you can definitely use these to set your
foundation or I'm just kind of setting
my contour with it that way that cream
product doesn't slip and slide around
while I wear it I do like them they are
a subtle difference in makeup but it is
a nice light makeup to set your makeup
so I do give that a thumbs up except for
our face I have a new elf blush palette
um oh I I me this was my favorite color
in the palette so we're just gonna press
her back in any one is rosy flush and I
love these two colors I especially love
my little friend here that's trying to
run away
uh she's Jenner and away mmm
anyways I'm going to be using her and
this is the Sigma F 15 brush and I
already can give these a good review
because I've mentioned these before my
channel I've been using these little um
Sigma Lord help these elf blushes for a
long time since I kind of started my
channel I've always had these used to
pick these up at Target it always count
on elf to bail me out in the blush
department next up is in exciting
products from if this is an illuminating
palette so it's a highlight palette I'm
going to take this new morphe elite this
is the e33 brush and I'm going to brush
in this golden color here it's very
pretty
as you can see they're a bit powdery and
not it's not too much of an aggressive
shimmer going on there it's a little bit
more of a subtle shimmer you can see on
my nose it's a little bit shimmery but
nothing too crazy with illuminating
palette I personally like my highlight
to be like shibam if you don't you'll
probably really like that palette but
because I like my highlight to be shibam
I'm going to add a little bit of this
gold highlight from laura geller just to
amp it up a little bit and that is our
face makeup done next we're going to
move on to the eyes I picked up this new
elf umm I shoulda palette and it's just
a sorta is what it says and it's a big
palette and it comes with a lot of
pretty colors and it actually comes with
a makeup brush instead of like that
stupid sponge
locater that no one uses I'm going to go
in with this orange color right here
same brush and just pop it into the
crease just as a transition shade the
lunch color didn't show up on me too
much so I'm going to go in with this
matte eyeshadow palette from them this
was in their new section as well and I'm
going to pin to this shade right here
it's a little bit of a topi brown color
and use that as the transition shade
instead that's way more pigmented next
up I'm going to take a little bit of
this warmer brown color
this is the e25 brush from Sigma this is
probably my favorite makeup brush in the
world real talk and honesty I can't do
my makeup without this brush so these
colors in this palette are insanely
wonderful and let me tell you why
because I have run into boot qoodles of
great shimmery eyeshadows from the
drugstore matte eyeshadows the drugstore
day in and day out struggles with it's
so far to find a good matte eyeshadow
that is not chalky or dusty I took the
shade all the way to our corner if you
can see I'm doing very small little
touches and then I brought an inner
corner to the same thing and then outer
corner and did the same thing back and
forth until I feel like I've achieved a
blended enough look this is the e30 8
it's a medium sized blending brush from
Sigma it's very handy if you have medium
to small eyelids the e-40 blending brush
is very great if you have large eyelids
I opted for the e38 though just because
it fits my eye socket a little better so
as you can see I built the color up to a
little bit of a smoky haze and next I'm
going to go in with this deeper brown
color right here out of the matte
palette
so next I believe this is a cream
eyeshadow base and I left the center of
my eyes a little bit plain because I'm
what is tresses trust try this out I
don't know why I can't talk today it
looks really pretty it just looks like a
neutral satiny shimmer color and I'll
apply it to the center of my eyes and
just tap it out
just very pretty you do have to layer it
up to get that really shimmer effect on
it um but it does where she dries pretty
quick I'm gonna go in this big old
palette right here and I'm going to take
this little light shimmery shade really
pretty it looks like that I'm gonna dab
it on top of the cream color next I'm
gonna go back in with a little bit of
that deeper brown color my e25 brush and
just soften up the edges where it's a
little bit harsh why is my eye watering
oh hell no let's add a few coats of my
current favorite mascara this is the
excessive lash by make up a flow ever
not make it for a little while but make
it forever except I'm gonna be adding
some falsies these are vamp trust these
are like faux mink lashes by violet
Mouse Marley Bella Bella
Oh little last you not give me a hard
time today baby go for the lower lash
line I'm going to go in with our
transition shade right here this is a
8:32 brush
and go ahead actually I'm going to mix
these two you know and I might go ahead
and smoke out that lower lashline then
I'm going to dip into the darker shade
right here with the same brush and just
blend it all now so if I had to choose
between the two palettes I would say
this one is a lot better than the bigger
elf palette just put this the mattes and
the bigger elf palette weren't did it
show up too well the shimmers were
pretty nice in the bigger palette but I
highly recommend this matte palette to
you guys it's so good then take its
smidge of that highlight shade and pop
it in the inner corner I'm going to
apply a little bit of black liner this
one's from the essay Edit it's called
extreme black and I'm going to pop some
mascara as I've been doing so much
neutral makeup for the lips I'm going to
do this doodoo brown color this is
called grunge and it's bite hard and it
is so pretty I've been obsessing over
this color so I'm going to apply this to
the lipice I didn't have a new elf lippy
to try out sorry guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
