what you guys doing hmm what you
thinking about thinking about some
cowboy lipsticks guys what's up and
welcome to my channel today's video is
going to be a review of all of these
college and I'll lipsticks my love today
I'm going to be going over the brand new
college and her lipsticks and yes ma'am
I didn't lip swatches of all 20 shades
whoa my dogs are barking
maybe my lips are hurting so bad right
now I feel like I smell to her they're
gonna bust open at least it wasn't
liquid lipsticks it could have been
worse it was just regular lipsticks but
I have about 20 shades and you know now
that I've worn every single color I want
to give you guys a review on it as well
and just really talk about it and and
talk about my thoughts on them and save
my piece on them so if you are
interested in seeing the review well
then you're gonna have to listen to the
subscribes on first share and subscribe
and now we're gonna go ahead and jump
right into the video
today
yeah I'm reviewing these lipsticks and I
put on all 20 shades today and right now
I am wearing this shade Mount Blanc
think I'm saying that right really
pretty shades in this collection
lots of nudes lots of reds one purple
orange color couple Browns couple topi
colors and yeah it's a pretty normal
collection of lip colors the packaging
is really heavy and nice they swirl up
and then they kind of stay up they're
not cheap they don't like slide back
down it says Kylie impressed on the
actual lipstick lid and all a silver it
says Kylie Jenner on the bottom of it
and yeah I like the packaging I think
it's really simple and sleek and pretty
we have 20 shades of lipsticks and so
you know I think they're pretty lipstick
guys we'll see I'm gonna go through and
describe each color and as I go through
I'll give you the lip swatch the formula
of these is very very very pigmented I
have found lots and lots of color I'm
talking one stroke you're getting full
pigmentation across the lips they're
very creamy every shade is very shiny
they're very shiny and glossy it almost
looks but it's how you get em on your
lips they almost look like you have a
gloss on your lip versus a lipstick
they're so shiny personally I like a
matte lip but I know that that's not for
everybody I'm just saying what I like
personally so if you can see right here
it's just super shiny and that's just
how they come off so that's all about
your preference I'm just putting that
information out there so you guys know
the finish that you're gonna get with
these I think they're really nice and
they feel extremely comfortable on the
lips very glossy very glide II and
glossy and they slough and move around
but it feels good they feel hydrating on
the lips and I do like that about home
especially after you try out 20 shades
go on y'all lips I'm burnin it feels
nice to have something of a good texture
on the lips
I think the shade range is really nice a
couple shades won't work for me but I
will tell you a few of my favorite
shades in case you guys are interested
in hearing that Mount Blanc the one I
have on right now as a favorite and then
granite a bit of a deeper red is one of
my favorites yes my fingernail is
missing polish that is for another time
that's a story for another time this
really light shade it called angel cake
I think will be really nice for with a
darker liner or maybe mixed with a
darker color but put this in the center
I bump chokolate suits a but I like
chocolate souffle a lot it's a very
shiny brown color and I also like
troublemaker it's a very spicy warm tone
brown but it was really pretty on the
lips those are some of my favorite
shades from the collection now I kind of
want to go through and talk about each
shade and kind of describe the color so
you guys can see it and get it you guys
will then see a visual of the color on
my lips so the first one is angel cakes
this one is just a very light pale nude
shade there's not really how much to say
about it other than girl is light and
it's nude and then we move in to
butterscotch which is another nude shade
but it has a little bit of warmth to it
a little bit of a caramel color to it
it's very pretty
next we have creme brulee interesting
thing there's two creme brulees in my
collection so I'm wondering if I'm
missing one of the shades I got creme
brulee twice I might totally be missing
something there I don't know the colors
look identical so I think I accidentally
got two creme brulees I don't know I
don't know but this is a pinky nude the
next color I tried out is infatuation
this one is a very pinky nude very light
pink actually I don't like this color
that much on me the next one is Mount
Blanc this is a topi nude it's like a
nude with the taupe brown undertone to
it very easy to wear it's really pretty
on my skintone next up is sherbert this
one you have to be careful with because
oranges will make your teeth look yellow
but this is like a pretty peachy orange
color will look really beautiful in the
summer time the next one is puppy love
this is a just staple pink color it
almost has like a touch a mob to but
once you get it on your lips it turns a
pretty gosh-darn pink next up is dulce
de li Chi I think I'm saying that right
the shade is pretty
this is like a staple go to new Tazewell
it's like a pink nude slight brown
undertone with it next up is crush I
like the color crush it's a it's almost
corally pink very very pink with like
this touch of coral II to it I think
once I got it on my lips it's really
pretty the next color is a hot ash hot
pink and is called amour I don't like
colors like this again that's a personal
preference but I just don't prefer like
a pink pink pink on my lips next I
really like this color passion is a
purple Bobby color and very easily to
wear very pretty in the fall time next
is Madeline this shade is a really nice
shade it's like a toned-down pink so if
you wanted to wear a pink shade but you
wanted it toned down where it's not hot
pink and a little bit bold this will be
great next is troublemaker this one is
that warm spicy brown shade that I was
describing before like a sienna and I
was saying that this is one of my
favorite shades in the group and my next
one's a favorite - I really like the
Browns especially in the winter and fall
time I think they look really nice this
is just your typical Brown chocolate
souffle I think it's so gorgeous a super
mommy cut with a really great brown
undertone to it is truffle it's very
beautiful
again just I would describe her just
mommy mommy mommy raspberry Charlotte so
it's very fuchsia very bright very
popping I used to wear this color all
the time whenever we go out to the bars
and I don't know why I was so obsessed
with it because now I actually don't
care what's right next is pomegranate
this is a really pretty red color I love
this color I think it's great
I typically whenever I get into such
deep colors don't put a shine to them
but that's just my opinion
next is red hot and I think the name of
this one really describes itself this is
a red hot color this has a little bit of
a warmth to its be careful it can make
your teeth look yellow but it's a really
pretty bright bright bright red and last
but not least we just got straight-up
purple and it is lovesick honey so this
is a very bold color if you're a bold
girl and you want to play with color
this is a
really pretty one and it is very even in
color and that's what I notice about
these the pigment was very even on them
and I don't really have any complaints
may being very honest I do like them and
I think I will wear the nude some but
the deeper colors I probably won't be
wearing very much because whenever I get
into like deeper nude colors just my
opinion not fact just my opinion I don't
like a shine to them I like like a old
flat matte nude like here I'm coming
mama
not like a shine to it however I will
say the more shine the more comfortable
it's gonna be on your lips and the more
low maintenance because whenever
something is super matte and flat it's
like really drying normally and crusty
and hard to keep up with it's something
like this you could just reapply I can't
say these are long wearing I can't
imagine them being wildly long wearing
because the texture of them is so slick
and sleek and glossy it's not drying at
all so I could see it coming off easy
but comfortable to wear so you give and
take there so yeah that is my thoughts
on them um and swatches I don't know how
much more I can say but I hope this
video is helpful for you I hope it helps
you to be able to give a good visual and
see what it looks like on what it looks
like on a face with full face of makeup
and you guys can really see if it's
worth your money honey oh I didn't tell
you how much these were I'll put on the
screen how much these cost in the
beginning of the video so you guys will
be able to tell but as far as the
packaging and all it feels really nice
umm these feel great I think I did a
good job on these honey I'm confused
about why I got to creme brulees this
can someone comment down below and tell
me am I missing a shade am I missing
something here is there something that I
don't know or maybe everybody got to
creme brulees alright so that is it for
