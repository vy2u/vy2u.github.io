guys what's up
today's video is going to be testing out
a bunch of new products from Sephora you
guys have asked me so many times to test
how this NARS foundation the Too Faced
Diamond highlight the little palette
from Tarte chocolate gold I mean I got
so much stuff to test out this brand new
as a four that just came out so we're
basically going to go through test it
out and see if it's worth it yeah dollar
bills or if it's a pass basically this
is the first impressions of new makeup
at Sephora and I hope you guys are
excited for it I haven't really done one
these I do Sephora halls where I buy a
bunch of seven Sephora but now I'm
actually trying this stuff out you know
what I'm saying
some of the stuff was sent to me and PR
to be fair but I did go on this four
website and make sure it is newest
áfourá before I put it in this video so
I'm gonna go ahead and sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and then we'll jump right
into the video
because I've been running around and put
on the sweatshirt but this is a freezing
cold rainy day in LA which is so rare my
cats are like girl we are not going out
in the backyard what do you think we are
for starters I'm going to try out a new
primer which technically tried this
already and I like it a lot this is the
new one from benefit so this is the
professional pearl primer I think it's
very very very similar to the first
professional which is one of their
bestsellers it's such a great primer it
goes on nicely it really works to smooth
out the skin and helps minimize the look
of pores this one's supposed to have a
little bit of radiance to it which it
might I don't notice a huge difference I
think both of the primers are great
though I don't notice a huge radiance to
it but it does have a pink tint to it
which maybe you can see through here I
look a little more glowy yeah I'm gonna
try out the new Norris Foundation so I'm
excited with this this is the natural
radiant long leer foundation I've heard
really good things about this this is a
radiant foundation so it's supposed to
be a little glowy I'm gonna use 3.5 this
is what it looks like
NARS is very good at making base
products which is products for the face
comes with a pump this is already a good
sign and it pumps them out this is a
brand new bottle
ooh very creamy and whippy feeling like
I thought I was gonna be very liquidy
and like squirt out everywhere but it's
it's not it's got like a little bit of a
creamy texture to it
the coverage of it just like applying it
to my face seems to be pretty full I'm
gonna take my wife six brush from morphe
Oh dark for her she she always thinks as
you a little more tan than what she is
yes I'm talking about myself in third
person
running this out it's blending out so
nice looks really beautiful and like
kind of lumi on the skin and it just
covered my zit really nicely thank God
oh my gosh it's like going on it
so nice a little bit kind of goes a long
way with this stuff and it feels really
light weight on my skin but oh my gosh
it looks so pretty on my first
impressions is that NARS did that like
oh my gosh it feels like it looks so
Limi but it doesn't feel wet and heavy
on my skin it feels super lightweight it
covered up
I had a big red zip right here it
covered it very well okay hmm so far I
am here for it and just some of my
friends have tried this out have said
that this gets a little bit shiny
throughout the day which it is a Louie
foundation so that is pretty much in the
description but we'll see okay I'm gonna
go ahead and add some concealer and then
we'll move on concealer and eyebrows all
right next up we have the chocolate gold
palette from Too Faced I think the
packaging is pretty darn cool on this
and it does smell like chocolate and
opening it up it is surprisingly the
color scheme is actually a little bit
different I think two-face has gotten
like a rut in my personal opinion their
past palettes have looked the same over
and over and over again and I feel like
this one does have some different colors
and it was just nice to see I am
actually gonna be testing out this
foiled finger paint palette from Tarte
as well is an interesting choice of
colors because these two look very
similar and then we have a cranberry and
then some pretty cool glitters over here
actually the colors look a lot different
once you swatch them but right off I was
like okay these look the same you see
it's like bronze champagne and cranberry
litters are a little bit gritty but not
bad I mean they just you can feel the
texture of the glitters oh wow hey so I
don't use both palettes in this video so
I'm gonna have to figure out what colors
but I think first I'm gonna go out with
go out go in go in with so blue she just
has a transition shade I'm gonna be
using my r39 brush so far this color
seems are really creamy
that color blend it out real nice real
nice round that next I'm gonna take
chocolate truffle on the same brush
she's gonna build up that crease a
little bit to darken it I really like
this brush because it's tapered at the
end so it just pops right in that crease
nicely I'm gonna grab a little bit of
decadent it's gonna well since I use
black eyeshadow and keep in my life that
looks a little lighter but let's see
what we got my decadent decadent I'm
gonna take it 8:36 brush which is a bit
smaller to fill in that inner corner
that way black eyeshadow doesn't like
explode everywhere in my inner corner no
now I'm gonna take a touch of holliford
Allah I'm just gonna press that it needs
a little mac fix+ it's a little flaky
dance all right with my finger I'm gonna
take gold coast super pigmented I'm
gonna apply it oh look at that in this
center these are really beautiful whoa
Nelly belly I'm gonna go back to my
little nugget brush and grab a little
more that Holly for a dollar and just
soften up those edges
that is really beautiful okay let me add
some lashes mascara
it's a liner and then we will continue
on with our try of new products
all righty while my lashes are drying
I'm gonna go ahead and try out the
diamond highlight this is a multi-use
highlight from toothpaste this is
another product that is oh it just comes
how the box I haven't opened it yet new
at Sephora it looks like this comes in
this little jewelry box so this is to be
like a diamond in the joy box I'm gonna
take a r36 brush sweep across the
product so honestly just first
impressions it feels like super pressed
in there and like nothing comes off you
know I mean you get I'm not like you get
like a little bit of highlight but this
is not a blinding highlight and I don't
know if it's because it's so pressed in
there I don't know if this it just feels
so hard and dry also I don't know what's
in my hair but it's pretty you know if
you like a little bit of a highlight I
think it's a little bit gimmicky it's
not my favorite next we're gonna try out
the cover FX glitter drops these are
news what the box looks like it's
similar to their first custom cover
drops or whatever not cover illuminating
about well we got three different shades
we have blue pink and then like a white
one I'm gonna try the middle one so I
think that's gonna work out best lay off
sleep will do he appeals the best way to
use these in the past is with a sponge
so I'm gonna use this on my little
morphe sponge and I'm just gonna drip
some on the sponge all right here I go
oh
I mean these are pretty and they work
but just so you know it's straight-up
glitter on the face so I mean these will
be cute for like Coachella really pretty
no they're really pretty it's like such
a fine grain glitter - you can't fill it
so I like these I mean I think they're
pretty cool interesting product I think
it's like an innovative way to use
glitter in it it just adds sparkle
honestly but it's so fine grain it's not
like hunks and feel super smooth on the
skin so I mean these are nice so their
glitter drops they are what they say
they are will I use these every single
day no but I would definitely use these
if I was literally moment or if I was
doing a cool look I'm going to Coachella
oh definitely you see so I think they're
cool next we got some new lippies from
Tarte I think I'm gonna try out the
bottom one these are like lip Stoppers
and then a lip gloss it was the lip
paint so I'm gonna put on this lip paint
which is new at Sephora of course it's
what I'm using it and I'm gonna add the
litt topper on top I'm gonna take it
E 36 brush and the two brown colors and
blend them on my lower lash line while
we're waiting on the lippy to dry I'm
gonna take it even tinier brush and glad
glad I'm gonna grab a decadent and just
blend it really close so that way this
black shade is not all up on our eyes
I'm not going for the raccoon look today
not that one it I'm gonna take this
morphe liner pencil in dark room and
just do the waterline I'm gonna take a
little bit of famous and apply it to my
inner corner just to make it pop does
that show you this pretty
okay let's try out these lip Stoppers
and see the tea honey the bronze is
called Park Avenue princess oh my gosh I
mean so it's a little bit too much for
me as far as like this is a personal
preference but I just would not wear
something I said harshness thing height
that golden just looks like a kissed pot
of gold
a little bit strong for my personal
preference let's just try on high
standards by itself it might be prettier
that's definitely a little bit better
I definitely like high standards better
these are not something I would wear on
the regular they're just a little bit
too glittery but it is pretty overall
yeah
so lots of sparkle in today's look but
yeah that is it for today's video thank
you for watching basically the only
products I didn't really like was that
last lip topper Park Avenue princess and
then the highlighter from toothpaste the
rest of the products worked out great
and are really really pretty I hope you
guys enjoyed this method of kind of a
Sephora haul let me know down in the
comment sections what's your favorite
product that I tested out today and
comment the word Apple if you stay to
