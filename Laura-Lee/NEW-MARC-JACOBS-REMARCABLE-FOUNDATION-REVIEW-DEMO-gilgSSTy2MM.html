video is going to be a review of this
remarkable foundation by Marc Jacobs
this is the brand-new full coverage
foundation and I will learn it for two
days straight so I want to tell you my
thoughts on it I'm going to be demoing
this foundation out at the end of this
video so if you want to skip to that
part or if you just want to sit tight
you will see me demo it out and I'll do
close-up so you can see like a bit on my
skin you're interested in learning more
well then just keep watching
brenn down on the foundation I first
want to just give you like the media on
it comes in 22 different shades Marc
Jacobs also makes a lot of good light
shade so if you are a very fair person
you have chosen a foundation for you you
might want to check this out because you
might be able to find your shade in it
they also have a good arrangement of
darker shades as well a shade that I got
is 38 beige deep this shirt matches me
almost perfectly but it has a teeny tiny
pink hue to it and I do not have any
pink in my skin I am like showed up
yellow olive I mean there's just not
much pink to my skin so I do notice that
whenever I apply it so it's like a touch
off they did match color match me at
Sephora for this foundation and this was
just the closest shade I could get to me
they do a really good job with color
matching at Sephora I will say that I've
always been pleased with their color
matching folks the foundation cost fifty
five dollars at Sephora that's where I
got mine the bottle is so cute it looks
like a little pill and it comes with a
nice glass and it is a dropper so you
pop off the lid and then you get like
this clear bubble and you unscrew it and
you get like this little s I'm going to
drop right on Who I am and said that
it's a it's like a little ball at the
end you're supposed to DAP that on your
face this goes an extremely long way let
me just promise you that this foundation
will last you for a very long time
I know $55 is in the cheapest foundation
in the world but you're supposed to use
so little of it and I couldn't imagine
using more than six drops max that would
be like some serious makeup this battle
foundation will last you forever in a
day it is 0.75 ounces in case you're
wondering how much comes in it it is a
big bottle but you just take note of how
much of the bottle is actually
laughs they recommend that you apply
this foundation with like a kabuki or
their Marc Jacobs brush I use my mata
kabuki and because this foundation is a
very strange texture to it
I can see brushstrokes in it so I'm
having to like do this a lot or tap it
with my finger to get the brush brush
strokes out of the foundation you just
shake the foundation before you use
because it is a liquidy foundation but
it's not like water liquidy like I don't
think it would just like pour out of the
bottle it has a little bit of a more
creamy texture to it it blends out
nicely it does have a fast dry time
personally I experienced it trying
pretty fast on my skin the way they
recommend you using it is dabbing go
bloop bloop bloop bloop like four drops
blend it if you need more add a few more
drops out a shin is one of the craziest
most full coverage foundations I have
ever used is also an extremely
lightweight foundation for the amount of
coverage that you're going to get in it
so that is a huge Pro for the foundation
when you're not using a lot of product
to you don't feel like a cake face and
three you're getting incredible coverage
if you don't need to cover almost
anything this foundation may not be for
you I can go ahead and tell you that
this will not be my everyday foundation
because honestly it looks like you're
wearing makeup it feels super
lightweight because you're barely
putting any foundation on your skin but
it the coverage is so strong like you
can look at me and it's not like oh look
at her natural finish oh no it looks
like you're wearing makeup so we'll say
that about this but hey I don't really
care about that me personally that's
just preference some people love that
natural finish at all times and you know
more of their skin showing through your
skin is not going to show through with a
salvation okay but if you have like
maybe some dark spots or just some areas
that are unwanted any correcting this
foundation may be your new best friend
let's talk about like how it wears and
my experience with wearing it I work for
twelve hours and more maybe a little
more than twelve hours each day the
stuff doesn't budge this foundation
seeps into your skin and that's just it
like it doesn't budge it doesn't move if
you have a problem with your foundation
sloughing off or long-lasting
foundations it is amazing about the
foundation especially for the little bit
that you're using but I will
a it does seep into wrinkles and dry
spots so I have like three very fine
fine wrinkles on my forehead and I feel
like this Foundation magnifying you can
see them from right here that's
embarrassing it's like I guess it clings
to your face so strongly and that comes
with a long-lasting power but when it
does that like you can see every wrinkle
I'm like oh my god please stop that does
stink about the foundation if you have
dry skin I don't know that you're going
to love this foundation especially if
you get dry patches or like a dry area
because it's going to magnify those
areas and that's what I experienced with
it if you have oily skin this foundation
it's going to be awesome for you
this is not a greasy foundation and
again you're only putting a little bit
of makeup on your face which is better
whenever you have oles skin and a lot of
times people with oily skin your
foundation slips off I have dry skin
except for this little triangle right
here I just wants to go crazy and spew
all and it's gross and weird but the
foundation it holds on like it's like
I'm not letting go be able to see only
skin I'm telling you you're probably
going to love this stuff again if you
like that natural finish and you don't
like to look like you're wearing makeup
not going to like this foundation I
think this foundation is an extremely
unique foundation I can't compare it to
anything but I never use a foundation
that is that lightweight and you use
that little of that isn't like a serum
or like extreme sheer coverage because
this is so little makeup such strong
coverage it's very interesting I'm
wearing it right now but I do have like
my bronzer highlight concealer but I
mean the other makeup as far as
concealers blush bronzers they do sit
really nice with it I don't personally
have big pores along this but I know
some people deal with that and I would I
did to get this foundation I walked into
Spore without a lick of makeup on by the
way I'm not one of those people who are
scared to go out in public without
makeup on I do not give a hoot I walked
in and I said hey I want to try this
foundation you know color-match me let's
try it out and he tried it on me in the
school store and I was like ooh my
coverage was so freaking strong to order
a foundation on line I recommend
googling swatches along people's skin of
the
show foundation a lot of time there's a
hundred beauty bloggers out there that
will swatch every single shade of it
like Asif or work or something and
posted on their Instagram you can google
that find that and see their skin and
kind of see how it's setting on their
skin color and use that as a reference
rather than the little pictures because
I know this is the most difficult thing
in the world to find a foundation on so
that's how I recommend picking out your
online shades last fYI by about it is an
oil-free foundation so it's about it
about this foundation I'll have a little
bit more info down in the description
box if you want to read up a little bit
more on it there are total mixed reviews
on it on sephora's website and I truly
believe that's because people with dry
skin have tried it out and it didn't
work out for them and I agree I mean
it's going to cling to your dry spot and
then there's the most amazing reviews of
people struggling with oily skin and
there are foundations sloughing off and
it's just not going to do it with this
guy uh-huh oh this review was helpful
and now we'll jump right into the demo
first I'll shake up this foundation that
is recommended any liquid foundation you
typically should say shake so then it is
recommended to place three to four drops
on your face with just the dropper
without dipping it back in like do and
I'm gonna go in with my f88 kabuki brush
this one is from Sigma and it recommends
to use the Marc Jacobs face buffering
come Basin brush so I'm just going to
use a kabuki which is somewhat similar
to that brush Pat it out and these
little dots go a long way I would use a
really light hand when like blending
this out on your skin I would go in with
a little bit and maybe see where that
takes you and then build it up I got
like it goes alright so first we'll get
a clear look at my forehead yeah it
settles into wrinkles so as you can see
there's my wrinkles I don't have
forehead wrinkles looking like that it's
pretty flawless I mean I have pretty
serious freckling and you can barely see
them I deal with any acne so I always
use my freckles as a reference for dark
spots you can kind of see a freckle
peering through right there I mean my
nose is the most freckly part on my body
and you can hardly see freckles it's
insane coverage that is it for this
video I hope that helped you out with
your decision
behind the foundation love you guys
