video is going to be a review of a bunch
of new Maybelline makeup that came out
recently launched and I bought it off
Amazon because they were advertising on
their Instagram that the first place you
could get it with Amazon but let me go
ahead and just have my little venting
moment about that real quick Amazon does
not know how to package makeup and this
has happened to me a couple of times
with Amazon they literally throw one
item in a cardboard box tape it closed
and ship it to you on the item which is
being flung around and then you end up
with you know highlights that look like
this by the time that you get them I
don't know how that's the only broken
product because like my eyeshadow
palette self was just thrown in a box
with no stuffing whatsoever and it was
just so poorly packaged and that sucks
so Amazon get it together with your
shipping also just where does I see you
I wouldn't recommend you guys buy it off
Amazon I would recommend you guys wait
ordered off the maybelline site or go to
Walgreens or CVS your drugstore and pick
it up and just wait it out just my
advice you know I'm going to keep a hood
okay but I have a lot of products to
test out majority of them are Maybelline
I just have two products for lore'l I
thought I would throw in this video
because you guys asked me to review it
first is the volume of lash paradise
from L'Oreal and the second is the
infallible Pro concealer which we'll be
testing out today as well let me jump
right in again be sure and subscribe to
my channel before you leave and we'll go
ahead and jump so I already have on
foundation because I'm not testing out a
foundation today and I figure we would
just go ahead and jump right in
remove this hiya back the first thing
I'm really excited to try out are these
little city mini palettes from
Maybelline this one is number 410 and I
have 430 which she looks like she's been
through hell a little bit but hopefully
the shadows are still intact and this is
urban jungle 420 palette 420 urban
jungle seems to be one of the most
pigmented out of all of them and I have
all three of these to play with I think
they have six pallets have three to six
No
I don't think I have quite six I have a
lot dog oh no my eyeshadow fell out
great
I literally blamed this on Amazon right
here but first I'm going to go in with
this shade that's peach in very neutral
and I'm just going to blend this all
over to soften up that eyeshadow primer
that we put down this is just a habit
that I picked up doing and I can't help
but to do it every single time I do my
makeup it just makes everything blend so
much easier I literally don't have any
transition shades in any of these
palettes so I'm actually going to jump
into the new bronzer palette hello here
it is the master bronze and I'm just
going to grab this guy right here
using a r39 brush to get in that crease
and I'm just going to blend that back in
for I have to have a transition shade I
cannot just jump right into an eye look
with color like there just has to be
that nice gradient base going down and
then I can like build up some colors to
make sure everything is really soft this
bronzer is making a pretty darn good eye
shadow I have to say what do you guys
think I really want to jump into this
urban jungle palette is so pretty next
I'm going to take a little bit of this
this palette has been beaten to help we
should take a little bit of this darker
brown color with the same brush I'm just
going to tap it on the edge of the brush
right there and then I'm just going to
focus it really low the darker the color
the dose that goes on the lower I want
to keep it I think the quality of these
eyeshadows are definitely better than
the lake 24 karat gold palette and the
nudes palette the Maybelline came out
with I think they really step their game
up with these eyeshadows and they're a
little bit more creamy and the mats are
really the thing that I had a problem
with in those palettes and these seem to
be a little bit not a little bit but a
lot more pigmented if you guys can tell
and now I'm just going to take like a
small amount of this brown shade I'm
just going to pop it into that inner
corner as well and then bring it all
around to the center of the crease up
here really impressed with this
eyeshadow right now if you ever feel
like your edge is just like buffed in
and kind of a harsh line you can go back
in with the original or
clean Beauty a blending brush Beauty
blending brush and you can just soften
up that edge really nicely like that I'm
going to take it 36 brush with a little
bit of the deep green color from the
urban jungle palette and I'm just going
to pop that right in there that outer
corner but keeping it low tiny brushes
like this are really great for detail
work if you want to do like a little bit
of color here and there and not
everywhere that Kevin Rhine oh goodness
all right I'm going to dump it and jump
in dump I didn't talk today I can't talk
any day I'm going to jump into the dark
color with the gold sparkles and I'm
just going to apply that right on this
outer corner to I'm going to go back in
with this r39 and just soften up those
edges the sparkles don't necessarily
show up but it is a beautiful black eye
shadow and it's really creamy so I'm
enjoying that now I'm just going to take
a little bit of my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre and take this new little brush
that I'm using this is the m4 21 and I'm
just going to apply this on the center
of my lid
and now I'm going to take this all of
you color right here same brush that put
the Mac Paint Pot on I'm going to place
it right in the center and I'm going to
add a little bit of that gold color
right on top I'm gonna go back in with
live with a dark color and just soften
those edges just to keep you very tiny
thymus strokes now I'm going to trial
this mascara for the very first time I'm
excited it definitely must and it better
than sex mascara from Too Faced I'm am
just going to throw it out there like
the one looks like it so just a bottle
hover the bottles like really
lightweight compared to the better than
sex so let's see how it actually
performs that okay let me just go ahead
and tell those of you who don't know my
lashes are garbage and it's not much I
can do about that but I think they don't
look bad it's pretty nice mascara it's
actually curling them kind of which is
surprising because it takes an act of
God to give a fascist curl I want to
head in through on some lashes because
you know I'm a lash whore and so I am
wearing these ones from Lily lashes now
let's move on let's go ahead and try out
this concealer which I've been excited
about we have shade three four and five
I'm going to go a shade three this was
sent to me and PR oh this is kind of
pinky but that's okay we're gonna keep
keep it moving it feels kind of sort of
like the Maybelline what's the
Maybelline one that's in this tube you
guys know tell me down below you guys
know I can't think of it I'm going to
take AG at 37 and brush and just sort of
Pat this out just being dead ask about
it like I don't know how I feel it feels
kind of watery and thin and very thin
it's not really creasing up which is
nice I like to Pat back and forth by the
way to make sure it gets in every nook
and cranny but I still see a lot of dark
masses not very much coverage happening
blends out super easy but I think that's
because it's so lightweight I mean it's
not bad
don't dislike the concealer I just
personally I need a little more coverage
right here because I know we all see the
dark circles are glowing so let me just
add a little more and now I'm going to
go in with an R 11 brush and just add a
bit of setting powder to make sure that
doesn't try to run away and get crazy on
me
lock it in so while that is settling on
in let's play with this bronzer palette
which I'm pretty excited about I already
showed you a sneak peek while I was
doing at my eyeshadow so here is some
swatches of the color and then they
actually swatch so subtly you barely see
them this is the darkest color the
highlight looks really pretty on it and
then the other colors are almost my skin
tone so it's hard to see like actual
swatches of it I'm going to take it m100
brush and I'm going to mix these two
shapes together and that's pretty darn
nice the colouring of it is somewhat
subtle you do have to build it up a
little bit but once you get it built up
I think it's a really nice bronzer
palette the second shade in the palette
is kind of useless for me cuz it really
didn't have any color at all little
confused by it but the other colors in
the highlights feel nice I think they're
really pretty I look nice and bronzing
huh here is the blush palette we're
going to be playing with next Seamaster
blush I did you guys up some swatches
and now the blush colors are quite
subtle but the end of the day I honestly
can't stand blushes they're like
incredibly pigmented so I don't want too
much color on my face Piggott are three
blush brush or just a brush in general
take this peachy shade oh see that's
pretty but it's not overpowering and I
actually really like that and now for
the moment that we've all been waiting
for
this busted-up freaking highlight I mean
literally this so depressing I'm going
to take my r-36 brush I'm just going to
get some of the crushed product on my
brush should be extra pigmented
because it's all crushed oh my god okay
little tidbit actually oughta see this
highlight while I was in New York
Fashion Week with Maybelline because
they gave us sneak peeks of products
that we're launching and I couldn't show
you guys it or tell you guys about it
but here it is and oh my gosh it is so
blinding it looks like a high-end
highlighter I love it
I'm all about it I'm here all day for a
honey well hell maybe if you bust yours
up at home and we have one picked out of
it
I'm just kidding don't do that but it is
so beautiful okay I need to slow down so
I'm just like going in and my whole face
could be the highlight but definitely
approve this and I actually got to play
with it so I already knew I loved it
face products by Maybelline stepping up
their game and I'm really liking a lot
of these products I really don't have
anything that I'm hating so far the
concealer I can go ahead and tell you
it's really pretty on girl it's just a
little sans maybe for like an everyday
basis but like when I mean my coverage
is just not going to be the one oh that
highlight anyways let me finish up my
under-eye and then we'll move on to some
lip products okay I'm going to go in
with the matte green this is an M 210
brush and I'm just going to buff this on
that outer corner and kind of connect
the dots with an M 210 brush again I'm
going to put the actual master chrome
highlighter that went on my cheek bone
on my under eye so really won't like
that little glow happening now I'm going
to take that really white color that's
in this I literally had one that was
water not drool I swear I just took a
sip of my Dasani and told over my lips
how did that happen I don't know but I'm
going to pop that white color on the
inner corner to like open up the eye a
little bit and I'm going to add some
mascara of course to my lower lashes
alright I got a couple of new lip
products which I'm excited to share with
you first we get the maybelline
superstay matte ink this is interesting
it's like almost like a satin
very pigmented oh it is shiny right now
let's see what happens to it and then we
get the vivid hot lacquer oh and this is
just like a lip gloss situation you
smell so good and then I got unreal as
well which is just really pretty
like a mocha color to cool all here's
the thing these lip colors like do not
match my eyeshadow whatsoever I'm still
going to try them on my lips and let you
guys see and give it the review and then
I'll probably switch it out of me and
for a nude color that will match so this
is actually really gorgeous and it has
like a really comfortable feel to it so
I like this guy right here by the way
this is in shade lover this just comes
off as a really pretty claw I like that
the gloss isn't sticky gooey or too
thick and doesn't have a way to mix
pigmentation it's just like just enough
so I like both of these products are
pretty nice alright guys this is the
final look and I really loved a lot of
the products they're quite different
formula from what Maybelline has used in
the past I would definitely say and I
really liked everything pretty much like
there's nothing I hated in this
collection be good today also be sure

leave I will see you guys in the next
video okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
