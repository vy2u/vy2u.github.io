video is going to be me testing out the
brand new Maybelline Dream cushion
foundation this one is not my shade
Maybelline sent these over this video
isn't sponsored by Maybelline they just
set these in a PR package and I was like
oh we've also tested I don't but I'm
going to test out these and see my
thoughts on it I like a lot of the
cushion foundations that they're coming
out with I've had good luck with them so
I definitely wanted to try this out
Maybelline make some my favorite
foundation so I have really high hopes
for it and they also came out with a
Luminator Oh wrong side I think this
one's in French anyways this is the
brightening creamy concealer and this
one is in shade light/medium so I'm
going to be testing this out as well
just let you guys know I do a first
impressions trying on the foundation and
then I wear it throughout the day so you
get a really good review on the
foundation so also really quickly I
wanted to announce that I'm doing a
giveaway on my Instagram with Mac
they're allowing me to give away the
more I carry it Mac collection which is
huge and you also have to do is go under
this picture follow me on Instagram and
tag two friends down below the rules are
under the picture and it ends December
the 9th so I just wanna share that with
you guys if you want to enter we're
gonna jump right in the video thank you
guys so much for being here I'm watching
and be sure and subscribe
oh yeah Levi hey guys so here is my skin
with nothing on it I'm going to add just
a little bit of the Too Faced hangover
hour ex-official primer because my skin
is really dry right now and this is it
just makes everything look so happy
ain't good this is normally with what I
would do and I like to test out
foundations you know with my normal
routine that way we see how it's gonna
there and I know a lot of people out
there also like to use a facial primer
so what I have here is a medium beige I
think I might to try out I also have a
lot of the colors also have true beige I
think I'm going to go from medium Brit
beige you feel a little bit closer to my
skin tone and you get the sponge
applicator which I'm not obsessed with
using these so I'll do that for half my
face and a kabuki for the other half of
my face and then whenever you open it it
has like a tab over which I pulled off
little sticky tab looks like this but
I'm going to go ahead and start but just
does it SAT to kabuki brush and there is
so much product so much product oh this
is probably not my color but I'll shoot
this is not my color okay cool we'll
start over who Cole so starting fresh
we're gonna go in with the true beige
not medium beige and I'm going to be
using an epitope kabuki I'm just going
to get a little bit of the product on
her brush and try this again that is
much closer to my color Laura what were
you thinking apparently I've never
applied foundation to my face before
part so it applies very easily I know
it's a cushion foundation but it apply
so easily it almost feels like a liquid
foundation just the way it's going on
I'm not going to build up too many coats
of it because I really just want to see
how a normal amount just like one solid
amount of this works out on my face
today it definitely seems like it's
medium coverage not full coverage this
is a little bit of a pinky color for my
skin I was gonna get dried up a booger
in my nose I was gonna get a little bit
of a warmer color but else we see that
didn't work out and so we're going with
a little bit more of a pinky color but I
still think it looks nice right now it
looks kind of shiny and wet but we're
gonna let it dry and see what happens
you guys kind of see a little bit of
pores showing and that's because right
now the foundation feels kind of wet and
it feels whenever it's wet the shininess
enhances the pores now I'm going to do
the other side of my face with the
sponge just for those of you who would
like to use the sponge you can see how
it works it's not bad I'm just like not
obsessed
I prefer beauty blenders or brushes
whenever applying foundation I look you
feel like the sponge drink up a lot of
the foundation just it being a cushion
foundation Absa
I don't not like the foundation but I
feel like it's a little bit shiny on my
skin I normally add a powder to my
foundation anyway it's just like setting
my makeup so next I'm going to go ahead
and try out their new concealer so I'm
going to be using the brightening creamy
concealer in shade light/medium number
thirty and it looks like a chubby stick
honestly I don't like chubby stick
concealers I feel like they're a little
drawing and don't give enough coverage
90% of the time so that was like nothing
on my skin but I'm gonna try it out
anyways because some of you guys might
like these and I'm going to give an
honest review this is not that bright I
normally am light medium and everything
but I probably could go up one shade in
this so I'm going to add just like a
smidgen of light yeah I probably should
just use light in that inner corner to
really get it brighter and this is how I
normally would do my makeup so I'm going
to blend all this out now for the
concealer I'm going to use an f-89
kabuki brush and just tap it out it
blends out extremely easy and it
actually does have a good bit of
coverage but you guys also sold it I had
to use a good bit of product on my face
to get the coverage that I want and I
still see a little bit of darkness
peering through I'm going to go ahead
and finish my makeup as I normally would
so that way we test it out and see how
my makeup would wear on normal basis not
just like leave the foundation as is I
personally would never leave my
foundation without setting it and things
like that and I want to get this
foundation a really fair shot so I will
be back I went ahead and did the rest of
my makeup it's been about three hours
they've been wearing it total I just
touched up my lipstick so we'll be
looking crusty crusty I like the
foundation a lot so far one big thing
that I'm liking about it so far is that
it is not settling in my smile lines
whatsoever and that's something that I
deal with a lot with foundations and
have to have that challenge constantly
because any time I talk I'm a very
animated person and I do a lot of facial
expressions and yeah - my long-term tire
not get it's not creasing up in those
fine lines whatsoever so I'm loving that
about it as far as the concealer I don't
care for it much at all um for
highlighting the faith look right in
there there's a lot of darkness and it's
gotten patchy and Creasy
but the foundation did dry nice on my
skin I feel like my skin looks really
nice I actually love the foundation as
far as right now and this is my three
hour check-in from the time that I put
it on and I really really love her mmm
hey guys so um I did a lot today I like
my health I filmed another video while
waiting to finish the review for this
video
ada chicken sandwich I think it's been a
total of six hours maybe six hours and
thirty minutes I mean wearing the
foundation and I really love like I
really love this foundation I think my
other makeup played very well with it it
looks so good on my skin I did get a
little bit shiny through here I didn't
add more powder so you're looking at it
and I think the longer I wear it it
would probably get a little bit more
shiny just to let you know I do not only
have a greasy forehead anyway so but I
mean it holds up like I would go out
like this and I don't think it looks bad
even though there's a little bit of
shine it did a good job covering it
didn't get patch it and then oxidized
and those are the things I just ruin a
good foundation so I really love this
foundation it worked out really well for
me
the concealer however didn't really work
out for me I'm not obsessed probably
won't be using this concealer because I
normally just highlight and contour my
face with concealers and I know I say
the work until it wrong I know okay I
probably would contour with it but it
seems like a really cool chubby stick to
do that with I mean yeah this is some
good stuff
I really love this foundation you can
see a little bit where it sunk in the
small lines but barely so that is just
everything to me I was a shade to bitch
through beige not too beige hey you are
wandering in Mac I am shade and c35 and
foundations I think the Mac one has a
little bit more of a yellow undertone
and this one has a little bit more pink
by the time I get the rest of my makeup
on I think it looks great with my
shoulder matches pretty well I'll list
every product I have on my face down
below thank you guys so much for being
