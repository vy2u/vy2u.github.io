welcome to my channel today's video is
going to be a review of oh my gosh we
got new NYX my gosh would you look at
like a lot of stuff from this line the
Moshi I love that name it makes me want
to just pinch someone's cheeks when I
say him Moshi Moshi Moshi
oh what's the thing
so it's mochi and I was wrong no I hate
shocking Laura Lee pronounce something
wrong hmm you guys are aren't you
that's what I'm gonna be reviewing today
I also do the rest of my face makeup
with more NYX makeup so you guys can see
the good-good from NYX and that's what
we're gonna be doing today I hope you
guys are excited about it I'm excited to
be reviewing it I love you guys and I
don't think you were watching our videos
in the intro nothing else right
other than that we're gonna sing the
SUBSCRIBE songs scrab to love you Laura
now we'll jump right
hey-ya flying beauty blenders oh forgot
a concealer we humming it's in this
jewel right here first I'm gonna start
off with spritzing my face that was my
face is calm and not hyper this is the
Mario Badescu face spray stuff all right
next up we're going to apply some
foundation I'm gonna be using this NYX
foundation this is the total control
foundation I do like this foundation
it's very lightweight but it has some
pretty good coverage coverage I gave
them a really good shake and now I'm
gonna just apply the teardrop I've
dropped it all over me with my six brush
which is my favorite foundation brush
pretty sure most do you know that but
there could be newcomers you still see a
little bit of coverage for you can still
slightly see my skin through it so it
looks really nice next up I'm going to
do the next HD concealer this one my
favorite concealers I was watching my
first video ever and this is the
concealer I used in that video so it's
been a favorite for years and years and
years so I'm just gonna blend that out
with the exact same brush we're gonna
take the NYX bronzer contour palette and
set it with the shade for bronzer I'm
gonna mix together these two shades
maybe using a r14 bronzer brush to apply
them and I like to just kind of start
cutting out the cheekbone oh girl she
got too much product I'll just blend per
day oh my gosh and then all this start
blending it out she's just gonna do a
little extra blending today cuz I got a
little cry cry with the bronzer I forget
how pigmented this how pigmented this
palette is I'm gonna go ahead and just
set this makeup cuz it looks really
powdery after I add like tons of powders
with the bronzer and setting powder and
all that on top so I like to go ahead
and then apply a little bit of a spritz
of some a little bit of the dewy back
into the skin so it doesn't look so
powdery and then I'll just typically
take my sponge and kind of cut it out
pressing that liquid into the powder to
set everything really nicely okay our
first mochi product we're gonna try out
is the highlighter unfortunately one
broke MPR so even though these are like
putty like highlighters they can still
break my mailman is a little bit vicious
sometimes any pros boxes I'm just
kidding I don't know but girl they bring
makeup all the time no people have no
mercy for makeup and I think most of you
can agree like they just they just go in
I'm like where's the love but I want to
go ahead and swatch it for you still in
though that yellow shade it's just
busted to high heaven this is the first
one lit life is the name of it it looks
like this it has like a champagne a pink
and a yellow I want to show you guys the
texture of these they're literally like
putty like very cool texture they feel
really soft they feel cooling as well
so this one is arcade glam and let's do
some swatch aru's ease arcade glam I
think is a little bit more arid Essen
like all the colors look kind of similar
because they're so air desam but we have
like a white pink and blue in the
handy-dandy @pr
box they send this brush which i think
is a little bit more
dents so it's great to use with the
putty like highlighters I'm gonna go in
I think with the pink because the
lighter ones typically look great on me
that's just me with a medium skin tone
we go oh wow that's really beautiful
the brush works really well with it - I
feel so soft so I do like either
highlighters I don't think they really
look that great
oh they're pretty okay that's nice
lovely lovely lovely so let me put on
some eyebrows I have like a hair in my
nose and I can't believe it onto my
brows and then we'll be right back to
continue onward with our eyebrows
darling here is the first I shoulda
palette is called electric pastels it
looks really cool and glittery i
swatched some of the top row for you so
they're super like pearlescent
iridescent and they're also very mushy
too
kind of like the highlighters the same
kind of like putty situation so that's
super cool here are some swatches at the
bottom row from that palette very
pigmented super bright colors they also
have the sleek and chic palette which is
the more neutral one out of the two that
has like a little pop of purple couple
warm tone shimmers but again all these
powers are shimmer and they're all like
the putty which is it feels so cool guys
like I just want to play with it I was
actually wrong the first shade and this
palette is a matte and I didn't realize
that but now I did says let me correct
myself it's a matte but the other ones
are shimmers and they're very pretty
they sent me a number 27 brush which is
quite dense so I think that they're
suggesting that's probably the best you
see these because they're kind of cream
and not like a powder they're like a
more like a putty so I would assume
dense is better I'm gonna first go in
with this neutral in le shade right here
the cream bond shade which is what I
typically start my looks with and I'm
just going to apply that all over the
crease and Bravo
this peachy shade is so beautiful it's
screaming at me so I'm gonna try this
one next I'll just rub the brush in it
and then we're just gonna like push it
on the eyelid blending seems to make the
color dispersed flute looks like the
more you like push the color in the more
pigmented it is and the more you like
blend it out just like any other
eyeshadow the softer the color gets but
they seem to be pretty easy to work with
right off the bat so I am impressed
haunted by buzz oh did I mention my
sweet Nikita Dragon is like in this
campaign and her beautiful picture is
like in the next door from this I'm so
excited for her she looks so amazing
come on pink I'm and it's happened to
this pretty champagne bronzy shade they
gave me a 30 brush which is just this
intense it's just more flat probably
good for the lid but I'm also gonna use
it for the crease today so I got some on
one end of the brush I'm gonna flip the
brush up and try to just target that
crease area with this color because that
Coralie turned out so pink I can want to
deepen it up just a little bit
that looks kind of cool I'm gonna deepen
it up just a touch more by adding a tiny
bit of this purple shade and I'm just
gonna buff this shade right into that
crease right there try not to take it
too high Honda Honda just wanted to find
the crease a little bit these are so
smooth and buttery they blend out very
easy you just don't need a lot of them
on your brush I want to take this pretty
champagne color and pop it on the lid
let's see how they perform with the
thing oh goodness
it's like literally super super glittery
but really pretty really pretty
lots of shimmer and sparkle you're gonna
get from these but I mean that's I think
it's really pretty I'm gonna go back in
with the purple shade we were using and
just try to define that crease a little
bit more and then I'm just gonna take
that first brush we were using and just
soften up I'm actually gonna try to
bring that purple back I'm gonna take at
8:43 which is a little bit of a tighter
definer brush tapping into the purple
shade I'm just gonna kind of run this
this along the lash line just softly
buffing it and I'm gonna connect it to
that corner these are really cool like
this is something different to work with
for sure but they're really beautiful
and they're really cool they look super
pretty
just like soft and glittery I'm gonna
take this pink shade and highlight the
inner corners in the brow bone I love
highlighting the inner corner it just
opens up the eye so much and just makes
it like pop that I just I don't know I
just feel like it gives the look like a
fresh open eye look and then I do the
brow bone this well to give it like a
little glow I like these because I feel
like they kind of melt into one another
and you get like this unique look that
you can't really achieve as much you
could achieve this lip powder eye shadow
but it's just easier to achieve with a
creamy product like this when I take the
purple shade on our number 30
rush and just softly connect that right
there did you to do just kind of bring
it around town like spongebob bring it
around town I'm gonna put a little bit
of this you a liner right and oh my god
the lash is trying to go honey next up
we have Powerpuff lippy I don't even
know what this means but I might open it
up and try it out the shade that I have
here is cool intention so I'm assuming
this is a cool tone shade don't even
know if it's gonna match my eye look but
we'll try it out for the sakes of trying
out the makeup and see what the T is you
have a powder puff so I'm gonna squeeze
it there goes the doorbell there goes
there goes okay it's like a whipped
lippy this is like a mocha color
kind of like a medium pigment it's
really pretty
hmm they feel like kind of minty on your
lips I'm gonna actually before this is
all said and done and over I'm gonna
apply some of this shade to my cheeky to
kiss okay what do you guys think what do
you guys think of the collection I liked
it all the lippy it feels kind of a
weird texture on the lips but I think it
looks really pretty I can't imagine him
being that long wearing but overall it
looks really cool and it's comfortable
on the lips I think that I look turned
out pretty darn cool the eyeshadows are
pretty amazing I really love the way
they work on the eyes just something
different and refreshing to use um yeah
but I think overall oh and the
highlighter girl go girls
so pretty like I love love love love
