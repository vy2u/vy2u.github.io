my channel today's video is going to be
a review of the NYX total cover a little
days gonna be a review of the NYX total
control total control total Jesus today
is going to be a review of the next
total control drop foundation it looks
like this it comes in a little bottle
with a little dropper and it was kind of
a strange foundation that I tested out
oh it's open that could have been a
disaster um yeah I got tons of tweets
for you guys asking me to review it so I
got it in and I'm gonna review it for
you guys and tell you my own thoughts be
sure to subscribe to my channel before
you leave and we're gonna jump right in
the video okay so this is an interesting
foundation and I say that because I had
an interesting time with like my first
impressions of it and I want you to know
right now I am wearing it it has been on
my face for around nine hours so like
it's hanging in there hold on NYX calm
and at Ulta and I believe there are 14
different shades of it and it costs me I
think $14.99 I'll put the price over
here because I might be wrong I also got
the brush that they recommend with it
the brush is not that dense and I think
it's smart to get the brush with it
because unless you have like I just
don't feel like a kabuki brush will be
very good with this foundation because
kabuki brushes are a bit dense and this
is super liquidy and I feel like a dense
brush would move the foundation too much
around and this one just like it been so
easy and it's so soft and it also had
these has a divot in the center for you
to drop the product into that kind of
holds on to the product and then you can
blend it on your face I had a very
interesting time applying this
foundation to my base now you apply it
the whole point in it is you can get
different coverages with it depending on
what you want to kind of customize what
you want out of it one to two drops is
medium coverage and then three or four
drops I don't know if they recommend
four drops but three to four drops is
full coverage foundation I started off
with medium coverage and the weird part
is when I started to apply it I had a
one to two drops and then I short hold
it across my face just like slowly kind
of massaging it in my shoes in it and it
was weird because I felt like it was
just streaky liquid all over my face
and it looked a hot mess at first that
was my honest opinion and it also wasn't
covering anything like you could just
see streaks of wet foundation across my
face and then like after less than 30
seconds it's almost like the foundation
started to adhere to my face and like
start to disperse and like stick to my
skin rather than being like a liquidy
streak that you could just wipe off it's
just really starting to thicken up and
like really apply to my skin so then my
opinion started to change a little bit
and about that time I was on to my third
and fourth drop and I was making it
really full-coverage which is what I
would typically do anyways um I like
full coverage foundations and that's
what I wore today a full coverage
foundation and I did go ahead and add my
concealer bronzer highlight blush and a
setting powder on it to treat it just
like I would any other foundation this
way gets a really fair review because
the product is super liquidy at first I
definitely recommend using a primer with
it but if you do make sure your primer
or moisturizer is dried 100% on your
skin if you've ever applied a foundation
with your primer still a little bit wet
or tacky on your skin I think that this
would really adhere to those spots and
you might get like a heavier coverage in
those spots so you want to just make
sure you get like a really even
application and by the way my forehead
is a smidge bit shiny and I didn't add
powder on top of it just because I
wanted you guys to see a good visual
what it looks like after 9 hours and no
touch-ups whatsoever I normally have a
really wet forehead at the end of the
day it's just like crazy honey but this
one is I mean it's not too bad it is a
little bit shiny but that's per usual in
this area is one with a little shiny on
me too but the rest of my skin is really
dry so I kind of have combination skin
I do recommend a primer because I think
it would possibly stick to dry spots I
use the angel veil primer from NYX
because it's like a silicone base it's
not really moisturizing per se and it
dries evenly on your skin where's
moisturizing moisturizers or
moisturizing primers can leave like more
dewy areas and this you just have to be
careful with in that aspect as far as
application I highly recommend getting
the brush with it I was happy with the
application with the brush it was an
interesting application let it set on
your skin for like ten to thirty and
from 10 30 seconds before you really
judge it because I was a little shook at
first and then it played out much better
if you don't get this brush just make
sure you have a really dense brush
because I think it could book you would
move it around too much and I think a
Beautyblender would drink up every bit
of product even dampened having tried
out our teeth brush with it which is
these little guys so I don't know but
these are really dense brushes so I
don't know if they would move around the
product too much or not I just don't
know I think it is somewhat long-wearing
it's not the longest wearing foundation
I ever applied I have some areas around
my nose where it just wouldn't hang on
to I am a little bit of a face tattoo as
anyone else like you subconsciously
touch your face a little bit throughout
the day so I noticed some areas
throughout my chin it didn't have much
foundation on it and it's because
probably because I touched my face and
like my nose right here I touch my nose
it was decent long wearing it wasn't
like anything crazy or amazing but it
was decent I liked it I do like the
foundation after wearing it I want to
keep trying it out but as far as right
now I'm really impressed with it it has
a decent price point on it it's an
interesting concept for a foundation I
thought it wasn't the most full coverage
ever foundation but I was able to build
it up for a lot of coverage so it wasn't
bad like I don't think it got to the
point where it was like Milani coverage
foundation I think it was a little bit
less than that with three to four drops
but it was it was it was full enough
coverage to make me satisfied I do wear
a super full coverage foundation like
really heavy full coverage I'm normally
way more greasy looking than this so for
the amount of coverage and like my
payoff and skin looks like at the end of
the day I do like that I think it's
really great I'm in shade true beige
which um works out pretty nice for my
skin I think I will be beige just shade
11 beige once I get a little bit Sun on
my skin don't get like a ton of product
in this but you're supposed to use such
a little amount of product that this
would actually last you a long time so I
could see why they didn't put it in like
a huge bottle like this because you're
just use so little dislike a little bit
go such a long way you just have to give
it a chance to kind of adhere to your
skin and then move it around because
once you
I move it around like I said in the
beginning it's just so liquidy and like
streaky you're just like what and then
it really starts to like gather up on
your skin and kind of stick to your skin
and then you're moving around a more
full coverage or more full foundation
I'm going to keep wearing it I think it
looked nice at the end of the day I
think it was decent long wearing I think
it's not the fullest full coverage but
you can get nice coverage with it or
medium to light coverage with it which
is nice that you can really customize
that I think this coat would definitely
work for people with dry skin if you
don't have a lot of dry spots going on
and then I think it could work for
people with oily skin I wouldn't use
four drops if you have oily skin I would
stick with a lesser amount and always
just make sure you set your foundation I
just add a little bit of powder on it to
make sure it lasts you know anime that's
my review of the foundation it's very
interesting on a good word probably not
