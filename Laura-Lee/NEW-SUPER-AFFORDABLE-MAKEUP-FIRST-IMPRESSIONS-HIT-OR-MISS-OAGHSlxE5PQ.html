it's a great brand yeah yeah exciting in
this video I'm going to using a lot of
Milani and positions formula because I
recently gave weight loss to myself and
I just bought it all in all I was off
the testers down the video and but yeah
it seems like everything that's coming
out and it turns like luminous dewy
glowy meaning you need so that's the
kind of look I went for today hope you
guys like the look you're also going to
see how to get the look and yeah we're
going to jump right in the video be sure
and subscribe to channel hustle use me
subscribe today
ok guys this is my mirror right here and
I'm going to put right here because I
can't see when it's too far away this is
the Milani prime light this is branding
from Milani this is their facial primer
it's like a strobing one to me I can't
tell but this is like super air doesn't
I'm honestly we went nervous oh it's so
shiny um I'd be a little nervous wearing
this out because of how shiny it is and
like iridescent especially during the
summer time because it's like my
forehead and pore will be magnified as
it is Oh free or oil-free I start every
trying out from Milani is the natural
globe liquid makeup oh girl you got to
crank it this one is supposed to be a
like very luminous glow a glow glowing
makeup and I take this sponge from
Ecotools and
is dampened and I'm just going to dab
this foundation out which in all honesty
the foundation looks pretty like right
off the bat like it's just it's a subtle
foundation it's definitely novel
coverage is more of a sheer like pretty
shimmery summer foundation really
showing off your skin and then blend out
really nicely with a sponge it smells
good does a sponge this smells good and
I could do sponge by the time I got the
foundation scrolled up half of the
bottle is empty we started you see that
this is a brand new bottle and the time
you get pushed up like half your
progress god this one has just four
references 0.95 fluid ounces twenty
eight milliliters versus 12 now
milliliter so you don't get a lot of
products in this next product I have a
test out is retouch and erase light
lifting concealer all right now I'm
going take my smaller blender from
Ecotools and it's like a little image
damage sponge is the same as the big
limit is smaller and it's so cute it's
perfect for getting in that detail
especially the shape of it you can
really get in the under eyes a very soft
sponge
you could also snatch that little nose
up real good with a sponge that has that
edge on it oh yeah and it's a very
pigmented product I mean I may be a
shade too light right now hovering I'm
in still got some darkness but by the
time I said it should be well covering
very pigmented to highlight your face so
instead of setting my whole foundation
I'm only going to set my under eye area
and I may be testing out I kind of broke
the package but I'm going to be testing
out this new positions formula this is
their 100% natural origin loose powder
so what I'm going to do is open it up
and put a little bit of this powder
which oops I don't know if that's too
dark no I don't think it's going to be
I'm going to get my little eco to a
sponge and I'm going to just set the
under-eye but I'm going to leave the
lips rest my skin looking like Dooley
yes a nice setting powder I mean first
impressions it's nice
haven't worn it all day but hey not too
shabby then I'm gonna take this little
brush right here I'm gonna just away the
excess so that looks kind of nice okay
let's move we're going to go ahead and
keep going with our faith seriously look
how freaking pretty this is a new run
booster and light to medium from
Physicians Formula it kind of looks like
a highlighter more so than a bronzer to
me and I'm not going to contour scimitar
bronze on my skin with it so I'm
honestly a little nervous about spots
the brush is picked up a lot this
product is real pigmented and it's
really pretty but I didn't know that at
first and I went in with a really heavy
hand so mount would be battling blending
that out so you want to go in with a
light hand
I'm gonna take my bigger powder brush
from Ecotools and just buff that out
next time I take the same brush and I'm
going to go in it with the butter blush
this one is in plum rose the color kind
of looks like it's not going to show up
on my skin but this is the ones that I
had in my drugstore so yeah I'm just
going to tap into her and you guys know
I like the butter bronzer a lot mmm
nothing so this color is like invisible
on my skin I kind of looked at it in the
store as I'm gonna try it out but it
looks like it might be of this llama
skin and lo and behold it is next up I'm
going to be testing out this is the moon
glow
strobe light highlight from Milani are
you taking an eyeshadow brush from
Ecotools you can also use your eyeshadow
brush to get really specific with your
highlight that's a pretty highlight
that is a very pretty
drug highlight right there so this is a
Milani like it's called sunlight it's
the highlight blush bronzer situation
and I'm really careful products they're
like put in all together like this but I
do see it is a great opportunity to use
it like an eye shadow I feel like like a
revolution palette with it which is on
Matt the matches are so bland like the
shapes themselves and just lying I'm
going to I mean good god at the
pigmentation I'm going to buff this in
this brush I'm going to go in with this
pretty bronze shade right here using
this little brushy right here like all
in the crease and then I'm going to keep
it smoked out on the outer corner
because it's product was so intense I'm
actually going to go ahead and take the
same little brush of in using and I'm
just going to top it all and if you
notice it says like big strokes I kind
of just like buff the color in that way
the powder doesn't go flying everywhere
next up I'm going to take a new little
shadow from Maybelline this is gold cool
oh that's cute I see what they did there
and it's a single shadow and you guys
already know what I'm gonna do with this
get out of here I'm going to take this
shade brush from Ecotools and this is
such a pretty color now I haven't tried
deep Alf it looks a little wool this
likey fortunately this does not have any
pigmentation to it this is me doing a
very hard three finger swatch on it it's
just like super dry and flaky and
disappointing and now I have wet the
eyeshadow and now I'm going to pack it
on the lid it is performing way better
wet so the honestly badges might be the
key with these I just wet the eyeshadow
and go on about your dying day you know
I'm I'm gonna take this little smudge
brush that comes on the other end of the
duo brush I'm going to grab the bronze
color and smoke out the lower lash line
the answer is just not screaming to me
and by the way this is this new formula
bronzer it's weird once you take off the
top layer of gold it's more of a bronzer
than it is even the gold on is a goldish
is like one's in layer I'm going to use
the stay proof waterproof liner this is
new for Melania maizena Vicks and Milani
eyeliners and I'm just going to top line
oh it looks so creepy when I do that
right I'm going to take this volume lash
scandaleyes waterproof mascara from
Rimmel London whoo look at that brush
let's hop on these little latches called
space down guys now I have lips I have a
new lip lingerie from NYX cosmetic to
put on my lip is like is this color
going to work count warren g this color
is called girl Wishon name dust till
dawn
it's a really pretty peachy color I love
the NYX lingerie but because this limit
this lipstick because his look is super
light hmm glowy ever glowy Khan is
adding it be a more matte metallic cream
lip I get confused and people call
things matte metallic I'm like I know a
more matte is the name of these but they
should just be called a more metallic
lip creams I'm like this is what they
should be called I feel like I've owned
this one before but it's like I'm a new
page on the website when I ordered it
okay guys this is my final look oh oh um
I forgot fresh one another program
really excited try out is the make it
dewy thanks ray faux Milani I think it
smells good okay let start out let's
write out yeah I think it smells really
good and then what I'm going to do is
say this will Ecotools blender and just
pat pat pat so I'll have to leave down
in the comments how this war because
we're not going to get like Oh instant
results you know what I mean it's going
to be like how this heavy spray work a
alongside with the foundation I'll leave
in the description box like my final
thoughts of wearing it all day as far as
I skin oh my god the highlight scars on
my skin I think my skin looks great
I love the foundation I really love the
bronzer I was kind of annoyed that the
gold came off and then you don't get
like eat more go love the lip products
love the bronzer on the eyes love the
grande girl and she loved to highlight
the blushing to show up on my skin comb
overall the Ecotools brushes were great
I've used some before and had a great
run with them the very soft has blended
up products easily and I love the
sponges they were very soft as well very
squishy and I love the cut of them some
part of the hit some products in this
batch is how the cookie crumbles
