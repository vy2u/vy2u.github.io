look on my skin and let you decide for

later video so hey ty for that I think
your sony announces a gun for you guys
so so yeah let's jump right in and get
started well let's jump right in by the
way today is International Women's Day
that I'm filming
probably not the day that I post but
shut up to all my ladies out there has
been hard for you
I think instead of eyes you guys are
probably going to want to see me test
out the new highlighters first so we'll
go oh god I just dropped it oh drop test
approved alright so here are the
highlighters these are the love light
prismatic highlighters this one is
this one is ray of light Oh a little bit
of rose gold go in there and we have a
gold one that's called you light up my
life very bronzy gold very pretty
before I put them on my face I'm going
to go ahead and swatch them for you I
like going to show you them before
swatch them because I'm not to like mess
up the pretty emblem on them so I'm
going to do a good swatch all right and
there they are those are the swatches
and so what they look like without any
flash obviously we have the gold the
rose gold and a pretty champagne light
or one which I think this color is
probably going to compliment my skin the
most I'm going to go ahead and put this
one on my cheeks I'm going to take a
more py 14 brush to apply this now this
was blinded by the light it's tough a
little bit of a champagne here one I'm
just going to run at my brush all over
it real nice line good lot product on us
and just apply oh that's pretty yeah so
these are not like crazy going to blow
you away highlights I think they are
somewhat natural but they're borderline
not natural and like super strong
highlights that contour right here just
needs to be blended I'm so sorry about
that
Oh pretend that that was blended more
I'm actually going to go ahead and take
this highlighter off my nose oh nice you
my freckles but we're going to apply
yeah that's like so freaking pretty
mm-hmm
so I love these are these are great
these are not like world's most blinding
highlights but dang is they're not
pretty I haven't tried a two on my
skintone yet I think that one's what's
gonna complement my skin tone the most
and the bronzing one would be really
cool if I was doing like a smoky bronzy
look now keep in mind you can always use
highlighters eyeshadows as well so this
will also be really beautiful eyeshadows
and just a little information about
these it says that these are exclusive
liquid to powder freeze dry process love
like takes the best of powder liquid
baked and cream formula to create an
unparalleled color payoff or pearl
radiance is silky smooth texture I
approval I think they're great
beautiful and they look like Polly
Pockets there's okay next we're gonna
talk about this summer palette this is
called the natural love palette and this
is velvet on the palette and it is thin
so I love to in Palace I'm not I'm not
really one for like big bulky palettes
like I don't live and breathe you get a
mega sized mirror in it I'm going to
fold it all back cool girl you get some
eye shadow so just adds up some of the
shadows or more glitter base and some
are shimmers a very smart fairytale and
it's a little more glittered base you
need a lot sparkle out of it versus
poodle which I swatch is way more
shimmer base you're going to get a lot
of pigment out of it I'm just trying to
give you guys my first impression so you
can tell my fingers have dipped into
some of them and so am sommore glitter
summer shimmer summer matte so you kind
of get you know the best of both worlds
in the palette this is a limited edition
and it has 30 shades in it this how it
does have never-before-seen neutral
shades in it and just the color base in
it like there's so many colors I
definitely think this would complement
all skin tones especially it's nice to
get start each ADEs
on color reading the press sheet here
and it also has some stage from the
natural eyes palette in the natural
matte palette and the natural and night
palette so the little palette that has
some shades pulled from those in this
palette but also never-before-seen
neutral shades have been placed in this
town as well in this palette retails for
$59 $59 people totally forgot to tell
you these a hard highlighters retail for
30 bucks okay so are you done at my base
makeup obviously because this video is
about reviewing the summer collection
I'm going to go ahead and do my eyes
with a little is't Oriole for you guys
to show you some info on using it and
kind of play with it and show you how to
lens out on the eyes so you can get a
nice first impression dr. pepper five
stars I'm going to go in with spotlight
and just going to blend that to soften
on my primer this is a Y 19 brush from
morphe ease guilded collection and I
kind of switched lighter colors like
this in the crease and then I just
slightly run it all over the lid to
really soften up that eye primer so far
the color doesn't seem to be chalky
whatsoever which is a good sign next I'm
going to grab is honey butter which is a
great really neutral transitions you
it's also just a matte eyeshadow shade
I'm going to blend that always start off
in the matte shade and I'm just going to
win that right on in that crease come on
little focus my camera likes to pick up
the end of my brush sometimes when I do
this in that toy and now just to really
build up the color I'm going to go in
with new D I mean if you're wondering
what that little dot was on new D I
splash a little dr. pepper on my Mustang
Laura only me you know
only me and my makeup tutorial would
would have that just keeps it original
so I'm trying to do people these colors
are going to be so much of the quality
of the chocolate bar palette which is
one of my favorite palette from Too
Faced they ever create it as you can see
they are not chalky and they're blending
out really nicely in my crease I'm not
having any trouble with them I'm now
going to go in with makeup and chill and
I'm going to focus in the outer corner I
think I went I like I'm like just
looking at the palette and deciding what
I want to do but they want to do
something fun with some of these pinky
Purple's because they're so pretty and
late utilize those so what I like to do
is kind of go to my little baby swipes
in the outer corner to like buff it out
and then take what's ever left and bring
it on up on my brush but I do try to
keep the darker colors kind of low
though with it it looks soft and really
smooth down that outer corner next to my
fake under cover which is a sparkly
brown purple color meant to get a dirty
pencil brush I'm going to work this in
that outer corner being sure not to take
it up to high school color is very dark
so under coverage is turning out more so
of a dark brown rather than a glittery
purple I don't know why I thought it was
so purple it has purple sparkles and all
but that doesn't really come up on my
eye so we're just really going to go in
with brown you see the purple Sparkle
maybe you can a little bit but nothing
extreme a meditate
bunny noise and can you kind of mix them
together these two shades so these are
kind of dope because kitten is very
iridescent it's like 212 I might take a
little more kitten that color just to
cool
honestly it like person versus thought
this palette is very neutral my eyelet
looks pretty neutral from it I do like
thanks to pop the pink in the inner
corner I think it's really pretty that
is about the gist of the color in this
palette and the rest is really easy to
wear neutral shades now I'm going to add
a little bit a winged liner because
actually to look it's very natural and I
just want to judge it up a little bit
with like some bold winged liner you
know sir now we have our winged liner on
that was it I'm really like working for
a pop of color I'm going to blame makeup
and chill and then on top of that I'm a
blend hot and bothered on my lower lash
line some pop of the liner and while
playing with our to face products we're
gonna go over a little bit of better
than looks
they're asking bah-wah going to pop on
some lashes for some mixture drama and
that is some dramatic lashes honey oh my
goodness oh so my lashes are drying and
now I have more excited products to try
out from to phase that we have some new
shades that they're melted matte liquid
lipsticks and these are very long
wearing these are what they look like
and I'm going to give you lip swatches
of each and every color so this is gonna
be fun for my lips yay
these are what is a and my these are
innovative formula glides over lips like
a lot of but dries ultra map it says
that they are with a no stain plumping
Siller melt and that ensures color
always looks rich full and kissable
features avocado oil vitamin E has
erotic feeling spheres to moisturize and
smooth the lips so this would be like
never shrivel never cracked lips I want
to get experience with these it means
either not my first rodeo would be this
is a summer collection however this is
like hello st. Patty's Day let's color
right I'm alright here I go
test number one
next time we have the shade granny
panties which actually adore it the name
of the shade hello granny panties I'm
probably wearing some right now yes I am
is the dry version of granny panties
next we have soaked it
do you like I'm read anything and push
you look funny we got three more to go
next to my tryout jawbreaker which grow
the colors Wow whoo laughs Oh certainly
not least we have why not like wine like
the drink not it's a very pretty wine
color alright guys that is it for this
look I really love the melted matte they
are a little bit of deeper color ship
summer except for this little guy right
here jawbreaker that's a super summery
of springtime a color the eyelets are
not really pretty very neutral I thought
I was gonna do more of a purple pink but
it did turn out very neutral and
wearable
however the palette is just called
natural love it's a natural everyday
eyeshadow palette it's good for like
everyday use something like that more so
than like pops of color it's a nice
palette I approve it I like it I like to
lift these the formulas great and the
highlights are really pretty really
melts into your skin
I think it's a great collection like I
always say it just really differrent
going you like and make up in what
you're looking for make up as you if
it's right for you but now you see it
close-up on my face and you can make the
decision for yourself of this video is
helpful of you enjoying it just the lid
