okay that was gross whoo
hey guys what's up welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be me testing
out the toothpaste unicorn collection
now I originally wasn't going to test
this out but I got so many tweets
requests for me to try it out before you
guys bought it so here I am I'm going to
test out basically the entire collection
and see what I think about it I look a
little weird right now because I already
have my face and my eyebrows on because
they don't have like a foundation
concealer and brow products with
unicorns it's like god that's
embarrassing there is a Taco Bell straw
in the middle of my intro would you guys
expect anything less I'm excited to try
it out but let me let me be real I'm a
little bit over unicorn stuff I don't
mean to be negative I'm just a little
bit over unicorn stuff there was a lot
of mermaid in unicorns going on 2017 and
I did have a lot of fun with that makeup
but you know I feel like it's time to
move on but I know big companies like to
face takes a long time to produce
product and it takes a long time to like
plan things out so here they are with
your unicorn collection in 2018 but
that's okay because I'm sure some of the
products will turn out great
I'm the I should of how it looks really
pretty I'll show you it further in the
video so I'm so excited to try it out
unicorns is anybody else is it just me
it might just be me honestly and I'll
take it you know I'm over you'd of
course I love them go for their day
we're gonna sing to subscribe song and
then we're gonna jump right into the
video
all right now we're gonna jump right
into the video
first I'm going to start using oh by the
way
oh come on nails how much better do my
nails look they were looking rough I
know my girl the nail doctor on
Instagram she does them she's here in LA
so this off subject but she does the
best nails ever and she also repairs now
so these are my real nails and I went to
her with like paper thin nails there
were just nubs because acrylics and gel
polish destroyed them so if you go to
her she will fix your nails if you're in
LA I'll put her Instagram down below
she's the best best best just also these
really cool designs just anything you
want pretty much and she free hands and
she's amazing check her out I love her
to death she is awesome my nails in this
picture reminded me of them okay so
here's the palette now the colors like I
said they look really pretty and yeah
they look you know corny but pretty and
then they have this unicorn tears
iridescent color so I'm going to smarts
from sage
Shh watch some shows here are the shades
in the palette they do look pretty
a couple are a little bit drier than
others but we're all the colors are very
pretty and I do think they could
definitely go with the unicorn theme
there's a lot of air Testament duochrome
colors to it and greens and blues and
purples which are pretty so I really
like the swatches so far I'm gonna go in
with desert vibes thank God there's a
transition shade in here I really like
that that way you can do a complete look
with well without grabbing another
palette and this color is very pigmented
I'm blending with it in five seven three
this is typically the brush I start all
my looks with you guys have probably
seen in a dozen of my videos so it's a
really great fluffy blender and this
brush normally comes in like I'm really
sleek but if you just wash it which I
typically will wash my brushes before I
use them anyway anyways it gets really
fluffy and I think they perform better
after you've washed on the gotten them a
little rough and tough if that makes
sense I might just be me again but
that's just what I love a good use and
abuse makeup brush next I'll go in with
sunset dream and this is a shimmery
shade so I'm just gonna blend it in the
crease with in
twenty-seven brush this is a little bit
of a smaller blender so it can be a bit
more surprise surprise whoo so that way
I can be a little bit more precise next
I'm gonna take dusk till dawn this is a
r39 brush and I'm gonna start packing
this color on the outer corner
now there's only one maybe two matte
shades in this whole palette maybe yeah
I think two matte shades so most your
shades are gonna be shimmer
I typically pack on maps like this but
since we're dealing with more shimmers
which is totally fine it'll still work
out pretty that's why I'm packing this
on but I typically don't I'm gonna take
fun to see which is supposed to be a
fantasy but it's a fun last spell in it
and I'm gonna take it 8:36 which is just
a pencil brush I'm gonna have to like
add some purple up in here right in this
crease I'm not gonna take the purple
down low or anything I just wanted some
light color in the crease you know no I
love purple eye shadow
then I'm gonna take mystic rain I'm
gonna use a little in four to one which
is my favorite brush to add color to the
lid so I don't have a lot of fallout on
this I'm gonna go ahead and dampen it I
don't have my mac fix+ spray setting
here which is sad so I'm just gonna use
this Milani make it last setting spray I
don't know why I thought that was gonna
be more pink but it kind of came off
more just like clear arid essence the
clean a 36 I'm gonna take beaming and
it's just a light shade I'm gonna add it
to the brow bone as well as the inner
corner of the eye I'm gonna take Vodou
morphe gel liner which is the purple and
the liner brush which is the M 250 or
the m150 they're both really great liner
brushes and I'm gonna wing it out I want
cheese purple since we are going unicorn
vibes today okay this is dark purple so
hopefully it's still looks uniform the
liner is a little bit of a darker purple
first time I use this one it's a very
wearable purple and I still like it
though with the look I thought it was
like a neon purple but that's totally
fine I'm gonna add some better than sex
mascara and then I'm gonna add some
little lashes in Miami and then I'll be
right back
alright taking my pencil brush I'll go
back in with the till shade no we're
gonna do that bottom lash line
I'm gonna take this Lancome purple
eyeshadow this is not on that's what I
got I know how to do my god eyeliner and
pop it in the waterline the eyes are
done what do you guys think it's like
pink purple blue unicorny I think it
looks really pretty and I really liked
that I should have palette it was a
little bit flaky but overall the
eyeshadows did perform really well and I
liked it a lot and I mean the palette is
cute it's just it's just very unicorny
and kitty but I mean overall I still
like it and yeah it's still performed
very well so if you're looking for some
colorful eyeshadows oh I dropped it or
some air doesn't shades I think you'd
really like that palette next up I have
unicorn tears this is the air distant
mystical bronzer so have my contour on
but this isn't something I wouldn't
contour with because it's so shiny so
I'm gonna go ahead and apply it to my
face as like bronzing my skin up and see
what happens I just swirled my brush all
around in it it's just like a shimmery
bronzer but it doesn't pretty the
unicorn part really doesn't show up that
much I think that's just more for looks
um but if you're not into super shimmery
bronzers you won't like this if you do
want some like cool shimmer in your look
you'll definitely like this bronzer we
have two highlighters from the
collection one is powder and one is
stick first off the stick one literally
looks like a unicorn turd tell me that
this doesn't like it just rolls out of
someone's butt hole okay that was gross
and typically with these I would warm
them up on the back of my hand before I
put it on my face because if you put a
stick around her face a lot of time it
can pull your foundation and pull the
other product and move stuff around that
you don't want moves around so what I
actually do is warm it up put a bunch on
my hand and then take my finger and get
it off of my hand or you could take a
Beauty Blender
just kind of do this that way we're not
pulling any of my other makeup which
realtalk like I don't typically go for
like the purple artists and highlighters
but in the theme of
unicorn it is kind of cute all right
here is what the highlighter looks like
so I'm gonna run my brush down the
center of it and grab all the colors and
see what it looks like on the cheekbone
it looks super glittery to me but we'll
see what happens this is our 36 my
favorite highlight brush just grabbing
all the shades oh oh it's pretty it's
super light but maybe too light for me
is this too late for me Lucy can you see
the chalkiness it might be a little too
light for me but overall maybe if I use
less of it like on this cheek yeah I
just have to use some less of this
product but it's just a lighter product
but overall it is a pretty highlighter
it's like very sparkly just like this
white air doesn't cast but it's pretty I
went ahead and swatch all three of the
lipstick shades so there's like green
yellow and blue the yellow one actually
comes off pink as can be which is kind
of cool
the blue is blue and the green is a hell
no for me this looks like swamp glitter
on the lips uh-huh actually because
we're having a good old time time with
this video I'm gonna go ahead and put on
mermaid tears and explain to you why now
so this looks like doodoo the prettiest
dude who ever but it just like this it
girl isn't no the one that I think it
could be pretty is fairy tears
that's actually pretty so I do like
fairy tears unicorn tears and mermaid
tears I really wouldn't go for but I
swatch them so you guys could decide for
yourselves and then I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch all of the glosses these are
called lip Stoppers
oh come on look toppers tear purse
toppers yeehaw all right here the
swatches the two on the end which was
the yellow and the white one kind of
turned out the same and then there's the
green in the blue they're super subtle
because they're just a lip topper but I
think the colors of them like these are
wearable and then these two I think
would put like a weird cast on your
lipstick okay and lastly we have boo
unicorn festival refresh so this is a
setting spray says mystical effects and
setting spray just so you guys know I
had this setting on his belly and the
product did settle so I had it setting
like this so just make sure whenever you
use it there's a little beat in it you
give it a good shake I remind myself of
the 80s right now I just looked at
myself I was like girl you in the 80s
how it changed colors guys so I'm gonna
go ahead and set my face get it go in
here we go that smells good all right
guys my final thought overall I think
the collection was executed actually
really nicely to be a mermaid unicorn
mystical collection so this is the part
where you have to decide for yourself do
you want a narrow Destin highlighter do
you want a glittery highlighter you know
do you like the air dust and eyes I
really like the I should palette that's
pong my favorite piece lipsticks like
honestly I just don't wear like glitter
iridescent lipsticks like more of like a
full coverage matte like boom-boom-boom
lipstick that's personal preference
um and then I like this setting spray it
was nice the bronze was nice just super
shimmery but really put on a good glow
for me and the highlighter I just
wouldn't use it every day this Takai
lighter I definitely want to use I
actually didn't care for that much some
hits and misses but again a lot the
quality was there I just it's just up to
you if this is what you want and you
if you stay to the end of this video
this is our secret so don't tell anyone
in the comment section but leave the
word poop below just pee oo pee or the
poop emoji between you guys hell nobody
it's just our secret it's just for the
club that stayed here to the end of the
video and yeah anyways I love you guys
thank you so much for being here and
watching and I will see you all in my
next video okay any stop go girl just
stop
I just never know when to turn it off
I'm turning it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
