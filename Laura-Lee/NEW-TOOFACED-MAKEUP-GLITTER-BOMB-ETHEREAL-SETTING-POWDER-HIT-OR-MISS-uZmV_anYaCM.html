and honest thoughts on them I have not
tried anything but they setting spray at
Coachella they had this and I can go
ahead and tell you I did like it but

ice washed or use I don't put it in
giveaways I typically donated I always
get that question asked what I do with
my extra makeup and there's your answer
and we'll go ahead and jump right into
the video
okay I forgot to mention in my intro why
my skin and face book kind of odd it's
because I already applied my concealer
and foundation because I wanted to try
out like jump right into trying out the
new settings powder which I'm really
excited about it's called a Seadrill
setting powder this is what the
container looks like it's very two-faced
very you know girly okay so we have a
pop top lid kind of a cover-up ex pop
top lid and then the powder just shoot
salads a little cute little heart in
there so typically what I do with
setting powders like this is I keep them
set on my desk just pop the lid oh oh I
like to cover excellent as a pop top lid
and I'll sprinkle some in the lid and
then I will keep it like this on my desk
and that way I don't waste powder I just
get my sponge in there that's what I
will be doing with this one I'll just
keep the lid open and set it like this
if I like it I think that I can already
tell you let me pay what I like about
things powders and what I don't whenever
they're very silky translucent flashback
II I tend to stray away from them
whenever they have a little bit of a
really silky I don't know if it's going
to flash back but this one it almost has
a little bit of a tan color to it I
should say like a cream color to it and
it's not like shivering white by Mac
that's whenever it typically doesn't
flash back I'm excited to try this out
like I said I already have on at my
column sealer so I'm just going to take
a Beauty Blender you can take one damp
or dry it really doesn't matters up to
your preference I'll only put it on one
side of the Beauty Blender not on both
sides that way I can just okay this is
kind of fill in like the cover up X
Laura Mercier situation this could be
good guys I don't know
and now I'll set my face and typically
I'll leave it on I typically start doing
like my bronzer and stuff and I don't
know stuff like that and then I'll wipe
away that excess as this is on so let me
just go ahead and draw on my eyebrow and
I'll be back and then we'll wipe away
the excess let's look at 8:54 brush and
I thought my camera was filming and I
just dusted away the excess and I kind
of massage it into the skin as well
letting you guys know this powder
definitely does not feel like one dead
point to flashback it's so very similar
to cover effects one that I love so very
similar to the laura mercier and my skin
looks a really nice soft and polished so
I'm pretty excited about it so far we'll
see how it wears off today also this
brush right here this man this is my ELF
5 to 3 and it looks like a little food
on it I don't know what this is on my
brush but girl she needs a bath I'm
gonna add a little bit of bronzer and
blush and highlight and it will move on
to the toothpaste products
shall we move on to the ice actually
we're not going to I'm going to go ahead
and set my faith mind you this is very
similar theme to the hang of our X
primer this is a reproduce this is to
say replenishing a primer in setting the
spray so it has coconut water probiotic
base ingredients and skin revive errs I
couldn't read that word for a second
there I was going to pretend like I
could but I couldn't I do like that it's
silicone alcohol and old free so I did
use this oh girl
the mister is strong I did uses at
Coachella and it worked out well so you
guys know that I like to you know the
drill you know I like to set my face and
then do my eyes I like to beat it into
my skin as well so I don't have like a
layer of setting spray on top of my skin
and I think my skin looks great let's
move on to the school litter bottle it
you hear that the glitter the glitter
moves in the palate and then you open it
up and I got to say the first thing I
think of is the Urban Decay moon dust
eyeshadows which are more there's
someone glittery a me like glittery kind
of shimmery and then they have a
brightening base and an intensifying
black base so the colors look really
pretty let's watch them here are
swatches of all the colors now they do
look quite faint on the hand but they
are supposed to be more glittery than
like you know like a shimmery pigmented
eyeshadow so I kind of see the direction
that they're going the moondust
eyeshadows to wash these back same from
Urban Decay and I like that they spent a
glitter glue and the PR package with it
because they're suggesting using it with
a glitter glue
and I say that I like that because the
Urban Decay ones I don't think really
suggested to use like a glitter glue
with it and that is the way that I found
that they both best work I said it 100
times on my channel I put it my
disappointments because it didn't work
well as an eyeshadow which is what they
are but it worked well as a glitter so I
kind of liked that they're calling this
palette glitter because they just behave
like glitter even
not really glitter they're kind of
shimmery with a lot of sparkle in them
that make sense first we said I
personally will not just go into glitter
and apply to my eyes I have to have a
transition shade I have to have a
transition shade okay so I'm actually
going to take some of my morphe this
probably back in July so hang tight for
that but I'm going to take like this guy
right here just a little transition
shade and just going to build up some
color that way the look is completed and
it's not just like thrown glitter on my
eye actually going to mix these two
shades together the two tan ones at the
top and this is a r38 brush and I'm just
going to move at this brown eyeshadow
around around around like this I'm going
to grab this mustard shade right here
and my r39 brush which is just a little
bit of a smaller blending brush to build
up a couple Brown colors before we put
the glitter on of course I'm going to
grab this warm tawny shade with the same
brush you guys are like is this a matte
eyeshadow toriel I promise we're going
to get to the glitter I'm just trying to
take you through the steps that you know
how I get the look you're not left
hanging and I like to keep the darker
colors a little bit lower if you notice
I am blending them lower and not like
taking them all the way out and then
whenever I have just a touch bit of
color on my brush I'll just kind of buff
the edges with it but for the most part
I like the darker I go the lower I keep
the shadow and this just like a good
rule of thumb to keep on hand okay I
feel like that's probably good enough
and now I'm going to add the glitter
glue to my eyelid and this is just a
two-faced glitter glue if you want to
get the pallet and you don't want to
spend the money on the glitter glue I
know that elf makes a nice work well
working glitter glue if you can see I'm
just applying this to the lid not taking
it up to the crease just tick tick tick
tick tick tick if you don't know why I
love sound effects so much so
my lips cuz what's all the tags you guys
should hear me in a conversation with
someone I'm like Laura use your words
okay I like to Pat glitter glue as well
kind of like instead of swishing them
around because I find it they get a
little bit of a tackiness to them I'm
not going to lie I'm kind of hesitant
I'm putting down like a white eyeshadow
on top of a glitter glue oh that's
pigmented because I just so the glitter
is not going to stick once I put a
powder all over it I really want to use
this gold but I feel like I should use a
color so you guys would be happy with me
and I'm going to go in with glitter
goals should use this guy right here oh
okay I'm not going to lie that worked
well and now you can take your brush
that you were using to do your crease
and just clean up that's pretty I like
it I do it worked out a little better
that's how it was going to no lie I mean
I'm not trying to like shade these
shadows already but the glitter just
like came off I mean I think the palette
is really pretty kind of like wearable
glitter I guess you could say this
palette is more so wearable rather than
just like chunks of glitter which can be
a little bit hard to where I would you
best describe it as like a shimmery
eyeshadow with specks of glitter in it I
don't hate it I like it I'm actually
going to add some winged liner and some
lashes the way the look is completed and
I'll be back but first I'm going to go
ahead and let you know people ask me all
the time what liner I use I'm still
order these up Amazon nails the quick
sell them in the u.s. at the NYC how the
hell are you going to stop selling that
doesn't make sense they sell these in
Canada but it's called New York color
alright is some winged liner and the
knees on my Amy by Lily lashes and I
also have the melted latex lippies and
we're going to go ahead and try out a
few of these this one is in peekaboo it
is different than that what I thought
it's going to be but I don't hate it
there's so much color in these like
pigmentation but they don't feel that
sticky a little bit sticky but not that
sticky and they're very even well this
anyways and it definitely has like the
latex shine to it so I think it's
beautiful
I like these high shine lipstick very
moisturizing - love you mean it
these are thick I'll tell you that
though I mean like the formula is rich
this is really pretty - it doesn't match
my eye look obviously but very pretty
okay love you mean it here it is take a
look
this one's called strange love let's say
the darker colors just have to work a
little bit harder on getting them even
but it's definitely doable so here is
strange love what just hit with my
finger I'm going to try on this purple
Eli lick called Twilight Zone and here
you have Twilight Zone come on color
alright and then I have a cool one is
called
girl on top and I think this is like a
lip topper or just like a lip gloss or
maybe you can make your liquid lipstick
latex looking yeah I think that's what
this is for I'm putting it on someone's
they're burning a little bit from all
the makeup life we have bye Felicia
right here this one is called but first
lipstick we have safe word fight me then
down here at this end we have I'm bossy
which is just a bright red hot mess love
you long time
rated R can't touch this it's so and as
far as some setting power I think my
skin looks flawless I will be taking a
picture with it and letting you know in
the description box if it flashback of
its consistency in the way I see it set
my face did awesome as like no
luminosity and it really which is where
I look for I hate this shine because I
find it makes the porcelain bigger so
let these I like I think they're quite
original the deeper the color you get
the more layers you have to add to get
it even the glitter palette I like if
you like this sparkly look on your eyes
it does have a little bit of Fallout so
I personally recommend you do your eyes
first and then your face makeup later if
you're using this because I'm like
swiping away the excess and
I like this setting trick I just tried
out in the past and it was so good so
