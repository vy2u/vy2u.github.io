video I'm going to be reviewing the
two-piece love palette as well as the
love flush blushes that are gonna be
very new for two days oh my god I can't
wait for you guys to see it I'm like
freaking out right now I haven't seen
part one this video I review the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation so
definitely check that out I'll have it
linked down below I have it linked down
below so you guys can check that out and
get my full review and thoughts on the
foundation and I just want to say in
this video toothpaste did not pay me a
penny to talk about these products they
were sent to me I wasn't paid or told to
review them
I'm obsessed and I have to let you know
about them that is all this happening
here if you're interested in seeing the
review on the love blushes and palette
will then just keep watching on a child
I want to talk to you guys about the
love flush blushes you get six of them
they're gorgeous
and the thing that they're promoting
with this at this is that they're 16
hour wear blushes so something I've
always said in every video that I talk
makeup is that blushes are the first
thing to go besides your lipstick never
your makeup starting to wear off your
blush is going to be the first thing to
go
so Too Faced created this 16 hour or
blush and it looks like a sweet tart ah
darn cute oh really love the sleek
packaging so many blushes come in big
bulky packaging and it gets on my nerves
a little bit for storage and these are
very travel friendly I mean really I
just wanna what is life right now
definitely get a pretty awesome
arraignment of colors in these I mean
you get from your brightest paint to
your coral to your purple to your ma B
color I really really like and range
from the color that they come in like
again I just said the packaging is just
everything yes the blush is the
foundation and the palette all launches
on toothpaste calm on June 15 to mark
your calendar launch in stores on July
15th so mark your calendars again if you
want to buy them in stores so I'm gonna
be doing some close-ups so just to let
you guys see what the blushes actually
look like I'm wearing justify my love
right now on my cheeks um you probably
can't see it because the lights are
blowing out all the detail in my makeup
is so annoying I talked about like the
texture the feel my thoughts on that
about the actual blush actual texture
the blush is very soft it's almost so
soft that it turns into a cream not
really a cream blush but it just feels
very creamy it's not dry and dusty
whatsoever but most toothpaste powdery
products they aren't and if you've ever
tried that you know that they're
extremely pigmented like extremely so I
highly recommend going in with a very
light hand whenever try using these that
way it's not like what I am blush I love
that about them so a little bit goes a
really long way to this blushes I also
like that the little uh compacts have
mirrors in it I mean hello polly pocket
right here hi nice 9 days children
anywhere 90 so now I want to
you guys about the colors of them first
of all talked about is justify my love
this one has actually a little bit of
glittery sparkle like a little bit of
actual glitter in the blush so if you're
not up from that I don't know that
justify my love will be your shim dig
but if you are it is just a beautiful
pink color like I was saying this is the
one that I have on I don't really notice
the glitter necessarily on my skin but
it does have that in there I want to
share with you guys love hangover oh my
god such a cute name I feel like we
should call heartbreaks love hangovers
rather than I'm heartbroken you should
just say I'm love hungover you know what
I mean the actual blush is a little bit
deeper than the packaging which I love a
whole lot because it makes the actual
blush color just perfect for a good like
a good neutral coral pink color that's
not too hard on the skin again the exact
same texture oh they're so soft I want
to go ahead and say I'm probably gonna
get crucified for this but I want to go
ahead and say they're softer than the
NARS blushes they're just very just like
glide like hand over actually has
almost like a little bit of an
iridescent glow over it it's very
beautiful and it is a little bit
luminous luminous baby I'm a sucker for
a peach anything I love peach and it may
not even look good on me but I'm gonna
wear peach anyway so I love peach this
is I will always love you ah we're going
to talk arid essence right now I will
always love you is like hardcore arid
essence it reminds me a lot of orgasm by
NARS with a little bit of extra peach
rather than extra pink it what I'm
saying oh my gosh so this is gonna be
like my summer blush like this is it
the blush for summer 2015 is I will
always love you
oh okay everybody just gave me a thumbs
down
great next we're going to talk about one
that's sticking out to me big time this
one is your love King it is a purpley
color now keep in mind it's not like
necessarily the actual purple color of
the blush compact which is a good thing
because I mean that would be a little
bit much it is and beautiful and when I
say beautiful I mean beautiful mop mop
purple almost
I wouldn't say mob pink it's a very cool
tone blush it doesn't have glitter in it
super mattifying if you don't like the
shimmer and the glow and all that get
the purple blush because it's a very
flat blush so it's called baby love and
I think it's an even more of a great
kind of a universal blush color it does
have a little bit of shimmer in it and
it is a supermom it's almost leaning
towards a really cool toned Brown blush
which a lot of people like brownish
blushes somewhat matte but it just has
that little bitty specks of sparkle
within it so it's not necessarily just
like a flat Bush really like this one
and honestly I feel like baby love would
be an absolutely beautiful blush for the
fall and winter time next is how deep is
your love now this one is for like my
hot mamas out there who likes some color
because this one is a pretty much a hot
pink blush it is a little bit deep but
once you swatch it I'm like trying to
find a clean finger here hello paint it
is colorful it's paint this one is very
pink and it is a flat blush like it's
matte doesn't have shimmer in it it's
just like flat blush now we're going to
move on we're gonna talk about the love
palette from two pieces they just came
out with and you get like three separate
mini palettes in the one big palette I
think that's kind of what they were
going for here you get a really nice
neutral gold tone and brown one and then
you get the more purpley pink kind of
brown gold tone one and then over here
you get more brown tones and it has some
green colors and a little bit of a
champagne color and it to get pure love
true love and forbidden love you get
like three mini palettes I think it's a
really cool concept that they came up
with the palette does come with an extra
large mirror the gorgeous fan and
packaging that this palette is it is
crush dangerous like this thing is hard
you can protect yourself with this
palette brace for travel I like
traveling with my hard pallets because I
feel like there's less of a chance that
they're gonna be shattered when we get
to where I'm going it also comes with a
black liner which is rare coz palettes
these days don't normally come with a
liner they normally throw a little brush
in here so I thought that was kind of
cool you just get a pencil black liner
the
the under the other end of the black
liner is a little smudger has two phases
normally really good about doing it they
put little carbs in here and they give
you ideas on what to do with the
eyeshadows and how to use them
color placement they have the one two
three four which is really helpful for
people who get a palette like this and
they want to use it they're just not
sure where to put the colors so I really
like that they give you the color cards
the color cars just slide right behind
the mirror right there which I think
it's really cute at first I thought that
the whole entire palette was shimmery
and I was kind of like hmm because I
always need at least one or two mattes
whenever doing my eye makeup to start
out with I never like to really have all
shimmer all over my eye but once I got
into swatching the colors I actually
realize that they do have some
mattifying color actually some of the
colors in this palette there are matte
they have glitter in them so I guess you
can consider them shimmery but they're
not really a shimmer color they are a
flat color with glitter but I will say I
feel like the shimmery colors are a
little bit more creamy than the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette leather
payoff
absolutely amazing as usual I've never
had a problem with color payoff with two
things me a thumbs up if you want me to
create some tutorials with this palette
because I'm kind of inspired looking at
it right now and I want to create some
pretty awesome looks for you guys using
the palette so just let me know in the
comments or just give me a thumbs up you
know let a girl know this palette just
honestly like all their new stuff
honestly is just reminding me of like
princess sweet makeup
that's so weird to describe something
that's what it reminds me I feel like
this is a good palette because there's
no like crazy colors in it so I think
you could definitely get away with using
this palette for everyday use but then
you have some pops of colors here and
there in the palette so therefore you
want to get out of the box a little bit
you could also go to this palette to do
that because you have a pink color and a
green color but the rest are pretty
neutral I also think that like these
champagne colors and the golden color
over here would be beautiful Bridal or
bridesmaid makeup on the back of the
palette it gives you a breakdown of each
name
each color so each pillar has its own
may that is my rundown on this pallet um
I like the arrangement of colors there
are some mattes there are some shimmers
it is a neutral palette but it does have
just a few semi pops of color and it it
is a very shimmery sparkly palette
overall it for this video guys thank you
so much if you haven't sent the
foundation review head on over to video
number one and watch the foundation
