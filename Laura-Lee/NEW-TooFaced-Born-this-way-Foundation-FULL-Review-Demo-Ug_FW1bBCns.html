can we just talk about the background
and not the cam oh she came out all the
beautiful new two-faced product whoo
today's video is going to be a part 1 we
are going to be reviewing the foundation
Born This Way in part 1 part 2 we're
gonna be reviewing some newer products
coming out with toothpaste it haven't
even hit the market yet I will link part
two down below but it would just be the
next video over not wait to tell you
guys about this foundation oh my god it
is Oh
foundation is just it's to die for and
I'm gonna tell you exactly why instead I
for and what great things it can do for
you and by the way it comes in this
absolutely gorgeous little pink box no
no this foundation comes in 12 different
shades I'm in shade sand which is an
absolute perfect match with my skin
launches June 15th
so people mark your calendars okay this
is a buildable medium to full coverage
foundation and best thing it's a pump
bottle
oh let's try this video off we're gonna
jump right in and we're going to start
by demoing out so that way you guys can
see exactly how it sits on the skin and
how it blends out I'm going to start off
with priming my skin with a hangover RX
my toothpaste because we're dealing with
all cons of toothpaste of today so why
not right and I really love this coconut
infused primer it's very moisturizing
and lightweight and doesn't make your
skin feel greasy I've talked about this
primer in like 10,000 videos so I think
we know about it now we're going to try
out this little bad boy I'm gonna try
I'll have my face on the brush and then
half of my faith the other half of the
Beauty Blender that way you guys can see
the finish with either or you could even
use your fingers if you want to with the
foundation just make sure they're clean
and we're just gonna get started first
thing I want to say is hello pump that's
my favorite thing in the world with a
foundation like if you got a pump you're
already leaning in the right direction I
get so sick of those bottles you have to
go fit to get it now it gets on my
nerves but I normally do whenever I
apply my foundation is I kind of go
Doupe Doupe Doupe Doupe
I mean you don't have to make this sound
effect but I feel like if you do it
helps it apply better we go just half my
face with this
f88 kabuki this is my Sigma and this is
just an angled kabuki brush and what I
like to do is to kind of stipple it in
places that I want it and then I can
start to smooth down God this foundation
just applies like heaven I've been
wearing it for like three days straight
now and I have never been asked more
times
what foundation I'm wearing isn't that
crazy
well it's got it my eyebrow and kind of
swipe it I mean look at that look at
that that still looks like skin that
doesn't look like foundation you know
what I mean so now we'll do the Beauty
Blender and with a Beauty Blender you
definitely want to go with dabbing
motions more so and it is dampened of
course
and here we have it alright so now I'm
going to zoom in so you can really see
close up and clear my face what it
actually looks like
you
now we're going to talk about the
foundation and I'm just going to start
off this with talking about the long
lasting nests of the foundation how long
wearing it is let me tell you something
I have a really quick story to tell you
about the long lasting this I woke up at
8 o'clock I put the foundation on I had
to go to I went to two pieces
headquarters
hello had the best day ever with the
sweetest people of a life and then I had
to go toward my new home I would sign a
crap ton of paperwork immediately after
that I went to pick up a friend then I
went to another event that ended I got
home at 2:00 in the morning I would the
foundation without one single touch up
from 8 a.m. till 2:00 in the morning
whenever I picked up my friend at 6
o'clock she got in the car and said oh
my god what foundation do you have on it
is beautiful and it was born this way
and I hadn't touched it up from 8 to 6
had not touched haven't looked in the
mirror ok so yeah I was scared to death
of what I look like I didn't know what I
look like but I was wearing the Born
This Way Foundation and it didn't budge
it didn't fade it didn't get patchy oh
my god it was a lifesaver honestly for
me because I was going to a really big
beauty event and I needed to look
Flik and not even being able to touch up
your makeup since 8 a.m. I didn't even
know what I look like honestly I could
look like a freaking monster and I got a
compliment on how great my foundation
looked like what is life at that point
hello and thank you just share that
story with you guys and then I got home
at 2:00 a.m. and my foundation was just
yes I mean it was looking good I mean I
don't know I don't understand like how
they created this but it's absolutely
amazing it's all free something I love
so much about this I don't care about
dry skin if I that was my cat by the way
it's not a ghost no matter how long I
wear a foundation whether I Drive here
or not like about wear it till 2:00 in
the morning it's gonna look a little
greasy
this foundation absolutely did not
it was just locked in and I I couldn't
think it enough move leaning towards
more of a heavy coverage but yet the
foundation feels extremely lightweight
oh my god I just love the colors I
actually could have worn two colors I
could have worn the color above one
shade lighter than say
but I went with saying because
summertime is coming and ladies and
gentlemen we all know we get a little
bit of color in this summer but wear
your sunscreen foundation does it have
sunscreen in it which is probably one of
the reasons it's so incredibly all free
you know what I mean I do like sunscreen
in my foundation but it's like a
double-edge sure they get kind of greasy
whenever they get sunscreen in them and
then you get the flash back with flashes
having sunscreen your foundations so
this one doesn't have sunscreen in it so
I recommend applying a moisturizer or
something with a little bit of sunscreen
to protect your skin before applying the
foundation aqua Jiang is absolutely
gorgeous it's like this hand blown glass
packaging with metallic gold writing on
it it's a pump bottle um thank you like
when things are on a pump bottle I can't
deal I'm just like no I'm not gonna sit
there and shake out a foundation you
know what give me a pump
give me a pond this is infused with
coconut water kind of like their
hangover RX it is not going to overly
moisturize your skin is not going to put
too much moisture make you feel heavy
and greasy like I said before didn't
grease up but it does hydrate your skin
so that way whenever you deal with like
a really mattifying foundation you can
look a little cracky and it can settle
in the wrinkles this has a little bit of
hydration it so it doesn't do that at
all and I feel like that is what's
giving it that extremely natural fill
it's not a matte finish but it's not a
luminous finish whatsoever it is that
perfect in-between it has hyaluronic
acid in it and I have no idea if I said
that word right but that's going to give
you that more smooth appeal to your skin
it's gonna make it look really soft and
my god it does I showed you guys the
close-up in the demo believe me it does
I feel like if you have dry skin
absolutely go for it's got that coconut
water in it for you if you've got Olli
skin this is an all free foundation it
is gonna hang in there with you guys I
feel like if you have normal skin my
skin is pretty normal besides the little
grease pit right here on my forehead and
it was absolutely amazing for me so I
highly recommend this foundation guide
it blends out really nice on the skin -
I love the way it blends out as you guys
saw on the OH
post pans here that is our review on the
foundation I really don't have anything
bad to say about it other than apply
sunscreen before wearing it
your skin thank you guys so much for
watching be sure to head on over to the
second video to see more products from
toothpastes that are brand new coming
out I am excited to share with you guys
I love you guys and I'll see you over in
