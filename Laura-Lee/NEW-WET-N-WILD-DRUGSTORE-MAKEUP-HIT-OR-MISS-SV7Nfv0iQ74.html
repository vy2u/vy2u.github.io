may scare the heck is she doing that's
because I'm trying out some new contacts
I had this as I like a lizard I don't
disagree with him
but I want to try out this okay I got a
bunch of new makeup in from wet-and-wild
and maybe testing out and I want to see
what my makeup looks like with these
contacts and if it made like all come
together it looks really pretty with the
contacts I'm going to be trying Rhys I
want to see like if it'll all come
together the contacts look good these
are Salonika I normally wear desi O's
but these are way more comfortable than
the desi oh oh oh cool someone told me
it's a lot of car way more realistic but
here we are with me looking like an
alien wearing them sure have my comments
will be like never wear contacts only
have your brown eyes but I enjoy having
the pleasurable fun of changing up my
look on to what's important here is that
I got a whole bunch of products from
when wild that I ordered and especially
the new foundation and concealer and
pressed powder I'm really excited about
trying so we're going to have to a bunch
of new parts on one wow I'm excited to
kind of give you a first impression
review I haven't tried any of these
products so I don't know the four one
one on them I'll tell you my feelings as
I go we can subscribe to my channel for
you leave if I didn't get started now
you can really see my lizard hi these
are kind of distracting me but we're
going to roll with it and hope for the
best
so I don't have a brand new primer
facial primer prom wet and wild to start
with so these are just new product from
what long there's a bunch of them but a
facial primer isn't one of them so I'm
just going to grab this new optical
illusion complex primer from Urban Decay
I've never tried this as well so it
could be like a first impressions on
this it says a smoothing have rose hemp
and argan oil and pour perfecting ice
want too little on my I really like this
skinny tube first of all but I squashed
a little bit on my hand and I really
like the way that it felt you like a
really thick cream lotion but then once
you rub it in it's still like
great it feels silicone-based I think I
got too much of an on I'm learning as I
go here bear with my skin pink I'm just
screwing everything up today now I'm
going to like a lot a little bit off so
I would say like a pea-sized amount not
the glob that I did who's going to be a
very raw footage all right so I'm really
excited about this new wet-and-wild
foundation and no unlined what my shade
would be so about three different shades
and we have peach natural with looks a
bit one for me so that we have bronze
beige and cream beige see babe there it
goes oh I love when they have like a
spatula if it doesn't have a pump at
least like give me something so yeah
this one looks like a nice color for me
it has a little bit of a smell to it but
nothing annoying or like too strong I'm
going to take my little more pbd blender
so I'm just blending it out blending out
very nicely I should maybe no I don't
think it's too dark I think we're good
first impressions it looks really
beautiful on my skin and my skin is
peeking through a little bit so not so
much full coverage loke he reminds me of
this Tom Ford Foundation is that crazy
or is that crazy I don't know how we're
cuz again this is like a first
impressions video but it looks beautiful
a little torn oh there is like I just
close with my skin give you closer to
the foundation look so much kind of
concealer I got two shades I got light
fair and light medium and I'm really
excited about this I hope it covers well
I think I'm going to mix something use a
little bit of both because one looks too
dark and one looks too light so first
I'm going one with the meat like me
and has a doe foot applicator it feels
really thick and like creamy it doesn't
really really water a spin and spin so
that's a good sign in my book it doesn't
have a weird smell to it either now I'm
going to add a little bit of that extra
light right in that corner to really get
in there and highlight it so I'm back in
with my little blender and tap that out
gosh oh wow look at that
sounds beautiful so these were $5.99 I
believe if I'm not mistaken that was
stunning it reminds me a little bit of
mac prolongwear concealer maybe a little
less liquidy maybe a little more creamy
very first impressions I don't know how
this stuff has been aware throughout the
day but like grasses I like I really
like the way it's looking on my skin
right now I might have to take out the
lizard eyes because not so Tech's new
product to try out is a wet and wild
pressed powder this is a compact and
what's interesting on the back it shows
that they did the test and that they
touched it with within it without a
flash and you don't get the flash back
with it so that's really nice and I
always get asked we're going to drop for
setting powder that won't flash back the
filling and this one doesn't feel too
translucent er to like I don't know
powdery if powdery sore but it doesn't
feel that way so I wouldn't think it
would splash back and it has like a
little bit of color it's not completely
like that white translucent I'm going to
take this morphe brush I don't know I
don't know how about the setting thought
it does that have a lot of color to it
is it just me so so dry I feel like the
setting powder is a little dark um not
quite translucent like not clear enough
for me like it has a little bit of color
to it so I feel like it kind of skewed
the color of my highlight
I'm not obsessed with this so far really
quickly oh I don't have a new bronzer
from well so I'm just going through on
just a edit beerus bronze did not mine
any over here I take this 572 brush from
morphe really quicken snatch smell
little nosey
you can skip over this part if you want
to - it's not wet and wild I'm using
Spring Sheen from Mac I'm just going to
add a little bit so we can move on back
to the wet and well as the wedding loud
I have this highlight which has been out
for a while I haven't gotten to try it
yet I've gotten to try one of them but
not this color I also have sorry I'm
rattling this box around so much I also
have this um rainbow one the rainbow
highlighter I'm going to watch for you I
don't know that I want pet on my face oh
god it's so pretty it's so good you can
get these at your drugstore seriously
like I've had such a good Excel is sick
that looks like a $50 highlight right
there that is so good this is for still
on the website though so you can get it
online and that day I ordered it and it
came to my house really quickly so if
you can't get your drugstore you know I
do recommend doing a little order plus I
have a whole bunch of new stuff we're
gonna be testing out the revealing a
lipsticks in just a second they're only
five dollars
Hey well I'm an idiot I stay here for 5
minutes trying to open this and it's
like a push button I thought it's like a
pool are Lauren Laura okay so just so
it's a blue highlight and it's kind of
like a frosty the blue few to it not I
don't know it's not bad I haven't tried
it on my face but it does have a little
bit of glue you to it I guess you could
use like half of these or half of these
if you really want it to this looks a
little more glittery a little bit less
fine-grain in a little bit less you know
Shazaam not as in love with this but
it's not bad I feel like I've seen this
palette around before but it does say
new and it was unlike their new stuff on
the website and I have a try
so we're about to test it out today and
see how it works hopefully it will be
great so we can get a good eye look we
already know what I'm going to do with
this get out of here I'm going to go in
with this lightest shade right here it
cut a lot of product comes off so
careful oh well the pigmentation going
on there it's like a more cool tone
palette by the way next I'm going to
take this little pokey shade right here
I'm going to keep it in that crease area
like the upper crease this is the e30 8
verse from Sigma by the way he's master
blending out nicely so far I'm not going
to lie a little bit scared of this
palette was going to give me a bad eye
shadow looks because I've had bad runs
with drugstore palettes in the past but
so far so good what's odd is there's not
like a lot of colors to build up Matt
since palettes like we jump right in to
dark colors after our transition shade
so I'm going to take this maroon matte
color next this is an m5 3:7 brush from
morphe
I'm going to grab a little bit of that
maroon color on a flat brush I'm just
going to sleep it from I'm not actually
going to take it all the way to the
inner corner I'm going to take about 3/4
of the way in and then connect it on
that outer corner right there weave them
back and forth just small strokes so
they want to make some effect that helps
you understand what I'm doing like
probably not um this is one of the most
beautiful maroon colors I've ever seen
is definitely a dupe for Mac eyeshadows
can't think of the name off the top of
my head so watching and the shimmers and
they are very flaky they're not like
really bad and unpigmented but they're
just like really dry and like powdery
here they already see how they're just
not like crazy good with that being said
I'm going to stick to the mass in this
pile expecially like those are the
strongest colors and I'm going to take
the color week for our shoes and apply
it to my eyelid and use the e25 brush
from Sigma to do so go ahead good guy in
our corner and then you can just buff up
the middle with that brush you are using
whatever blending brush was on hand I'll
be safe I'm going to just take the
tardis black liner and line my waterline
I don't know what involves like liner so
you know Oh what mine are faced add some
lashes and mascara and I'll be back rest
Gabonese this big colossal mascara that
I've been loving from Maybelline it's
really good um it like builds up your
lashes really thick if you don't like
that you might not like this mascara but
I'm digging it now I'm really excited
try out see new liquid lipstick since
I've heard so many great things I want
to try out rebel rose and nude as I said
nipple and nude something I want to make
these to see just what beautiful how'd I
definitely have a doe foot applicator
with a little divot in there which I
don't ever mind it's like this short
little applicator they don't really have
a smell to long
I'm living for this color right here
what I normally like to do is let it dry
for like a few seconds and then I'll add
the nude one in the middle this is
called a new all nudie patootie I love
saying cutie patootie muscle of you
right no it's like just barely setting
on my head what's the point
this looks like a really nice cold home
news which I typically like I feel like
I'm ruining this lip color that webson
it on because this look the first color
turned out to be so beautiful and that
turned out really pretty and I
definitely like the contact have tone I
think girl a little lizard a still but I
think they definitely toned down a lot
since I presented in the beginning of
the video with especially the lashes and
the eye look so it's not so harsh I knew
that would happen
see I just hung your nail with them is
the finished look and I must say it
looks like I have on all high-end makeup
honestly it looks like I have spent a
fortune on my makeup look and most of
the makeup I'm wearing today was $5.99
to 6 dollars a piece which is just
mind-blowing ly crazy the only problems
I'm a little iffy about is the setting
powder the rainbow highlighter and the
shimmers and the eyeshadow palette and
everything else
I actually adored it was this girl so
good with lipsticks are very sticky but
I think they're still in the moment of
drying down they feel really comfortable
as you can see I mean my lips already
dry over here but they're not really
breaking or cracking yeah that's it for
