hey guys what's up and welcome to my
channel today's video I look a little
weird because I don't have on all my
makeup and make it was just partially
done so I know my brows look a little
harsh and stuff like that because I'm
going to be testing out the new
watson-watt now Wet n Wild mermaid
collection I'm really excited to be
trying this out we as the these are
really cool-looking mermaidia cream I
chose the mega lash metallic eyeliners
liquid lipsticks in a bomb a highlighter
because I got swatched at the event I'm
excited to test out this collection I'm
going to do lip swatches of all the
colors you can see how they look on this
collection is limited edition this video
is not sponsored i went wild I just know
you guys love to hear the tea on one
wall so I figured I'd review it and I
got this little box at the event so you
know we're going to talk about today
I'll throw some fresh sheets on it so
just like looking at these while talking
hello LR get it together sure so without
further ado be sure school yes and we'll
go ahead and jump right into the video
okay so I'm excited to test out this
collection I don't even know where to
start of just like looking at me and you
guys like well we can't see it so it's
diet first I feel like we should try at
the highlight let's be real I know
that's what I wants to see it's like
this mermaidy highlighting bar
it's called midnight moon I forgot to
take off all the stickers before filming
so now I get to sit here and do this
great here's a look at it before I
swatch it it has like this iridescent
very mermaidy fish pin fill to it so I
swatch it and there oh yeah there's a
lot of pigmentation just like I remember
at the event this was just like one
finger slide one swish mind you when
want products are just incredibly
affordable and not only that they're
cool too free I'm going to take my r-36
brush and I'm going to get some on here
this one is going to retail for $6.99 so
7 bucks
tapping it on a face is still mad
it doesn't have any luminosity if you're
away on the highlight go ahead and get
someone there
oh it just has like this really cool
Sheen to it get a little bit more yeah I
really I'm feeling this do really cool
hard lighter it's a little bit hard to
describe it's bright and then it has
like this gold backlight that I come
through it it's almost kind of greeny
he's kind of gray I should say oh hi
Bobby pan I try to hide that real well
and then it has like this gold
reflective that comes through it so very
a blinding though I have to say like
that's so cool if you guys are I mean
I've already played with a highlight
like I haven't really put it on but do
you see I like the gray like looks a
little weird straight on but then you
hit it with the light and it's beautiful
so that's something a little bit iffy
about this highlight just like on my
skin tone like it looks dark so to be
honest if you have my skin tone you
might have to go in like that looks
really pretty like that it's like I'm
going on there you can see more the
bluish gray that peeks through how they
just wet a little bit less of it because
I feel like I'm getting a weird darkness
from it but that's just first
impressions of it on my face let's move
on and test out some of the cream
eyeshadows we have for cream eyeshadows
if you can see they are really sparkly
and have like that mermaid purple
greenish blue tint to it so these are
supposed to be like glitter eye shows
and I have to admit they remind me a
little bit of the Stila foiled
eyeshadows that go on these are $5 a
piece so they are less than half the
price of that so they just double into a
little bit more pigmented these or touch
patchy but I said we could build this up
really pretty I'm gonna try to do that
on my eyes right now and test it out it
says it provides high-impact metallic
color in for long lasting shades cruelty
free fragrance free gluten free vegan so
let's test it out I'm add on just a
little bit of a brownie transition shoes
so it's just not like glitter everywhere
really guys they're all of my face
punished oh cool she's blending
using a color that you guys can't know
about y'all but this is one my bomb
favorite colors I have been wearing
and you guys can't know what it is I
know it's so and when people do that I
know I'm being annoying right now I'm
going to take a kwatak prism which is
the blue one and I'm going to apply it
to my eyelid geez there's a lot of color
my only fear is that this has got to
bleed everywhere I'm going to take a dab
of purple eyeshadow because this is not
very forgiving in the crease area I just
feel like if you don't get it perfect
right there in that crease area it just
doesn't want to forgive ya and it leaves
like a splotchiness to is ooh mmm
I would say these are the most easy
thing in the world to work with as you
can see I was just being really careful
and slow I also feel like that looks
like hi Inga litter though and these are
$4.99 so that's amazing
the thing that this is a really cool mer
maybe I look and I just a little bit I
shadow because like the edges get a
little weird with the cream and you got
to kind of add something in there so I
just put some purple down and I think
it's drying nicely and overall is pretty
much like a high-end eyeshadow so before
I actually do this I want to test out
one of their new liners because I don't
feel like the liners are going to work
well with this you're not going to be
able to see how it performs as well so
let me go into the liner let's say we
have gray blue and green new eyeliners
from them they do seem a little bit thin
but but with lot when wild eyeliners in
the past I've been able to always been
able to build them up nicely but this
blue one seems super thin compared to
the grey in the middle and the green on
the end so maybe let's test out this
green moment
it's getting a little bit chunky right
here but overall like that's a really
nice liner and I do like it a lot I mean
you just kind of have to play with it a
little bit and I'm okay with doing that
since there's three ninety-nine my most
fun possum makeup look if I paid $40 for
an eye liner I don't want it to do today
I don't want to have to play with it
manipulates make it work pay four
dollars for an eye liner and it looks as
good and I had to just you know tweak it
a little bit I'm fine with that that's
just my personal preference and like how
I normally look at makeup I think that
liner is so full and really beautiful I
have used their black liner before to do
my wings and I loved it so the line is
great I approve it I think this
eyeshadow like moment over here is
phenomenal and beautiful I mean so sadly
I'm going to wipe off this liner and
create this look over here actually it's
not coming off like see how it's like on
there that's a good thing and it barely
had time to dry down I just think the T
on one wild is honestly I feel like they
create some of the best makeup for the
lowest price I mean sometimes make it so
affordable but it's really just not
worth it like the forever 21 makeup it's
not worth their low prices to me because
the makeup is just pure garbage but you
know then you get into went wild and it
seems like they actually try to achieve
making great makeup cruelty-free for a
fair price and I'm here all day for that
girl come here I've always been a big
wet Walton
oh the green residue in my eyelashes
that we'll all pretend that is it there
hmm some of that mystery brown shade I'm
going to take this really cool color
again and just see how I lightly dabbing
it so we don't go cars right all over my
eyelid bright blue liquid glitters it
can go from 0 to 100 real quick and girl
that's when you leave in the house about
an hour late cuz you had an explosion on
your eyelid we just want to take our
time with the next I'm gonna try out
those liquid lips and if you notice I
did more of a tapping motion than a
swipe of motion can see how it gets a
little weird it's really hard to get
perfect and that's where I'm trying to
go in with this purple shade
just flex it on out first and letting it
dry so that brushed I'm about to use
does it snatched the color and take it
everywhere I want to do real bad fine to
you next up I've been watching True
Blood too much Anya I need to take it
back a little bit but next up I have all
of these little oh come on next if I
have to lick a lipstick from the mermaid
collection again a limited edition and
four new shades with a blue a green a
reddish color and I can't warranty
bronzy how would you describe that no
one of these are not vegan the rest of
them are and it's the reddish color a
lot of red makeup has carmine in it and
that's what makes it red and beautiful
and not Stamey and crazy like purples
and reds I don't know who was a mistake
at the lab or they did it on purpose but
this one has combine in it so it is not
vegan but it is cruelty-free um so it
doesn't have a beat on the end of it and
the other ones do so there's that and
just letting you guys know that if
you're buying only being a makeup don't
buy the red one and we're going to just
press that home so these are all
shimmery by the way oh it's so thick
already like coming out to Blues like
look at that look how even that is and
how dark and bold this color is I just
don't understand when we have brands
charging out that a-hole for liquid
lipstick that can't figure this out I'm
like when wow I'm just in shock hot even
this is so what do you guys think we
have a super blue color it's hard for me
to talk because like there's just so
much going on with my makeup today I'm
like at the camera but this is a blue
that's when it's actually called as
threw it across the room that was safe
seduction she used to put the false
lashes on like a bald eagle this one is
called Coral crown it is very bronze II
personally I won't wear colors like this
it's just like not my cup of tea but in
general the color it worked very nicely
on the lips and I will say I have to dip
into a few more times to get it even
with the blue but it's still you know
it's a really nice color and by the way
all these going to be $4.99 each next
we're trying out sirens Joel oh golly so
this is sirens jewel it had very similar
quality
of the blue one so very sick rich in
color so comfortable on my lips and it
was really easy to apply pretty evenly
I'm going to prove that look at sea
monster I really like a sea monster not
really like a mermaid but we'll keep the
video going that's weird
we have a mustache para a crush is
someone that is not vegan that we're
trying out now this one's really pretty
I feel like it was just like the bronze
do want a little bit harder to work with
but it feels comfortable it looks
beautiful on the lips this is I think
the most wearable one of all of them
unless you like the bronze the one I
personally don't just like not my cup of
tea but yeah I think they're all pretty
the Lizabeth section doesn't have tried
out in the password from very well so I
expected a lot out of these and I think
they perform very well they're all
shimmery a little wacky colors but they
are collector's item you know then the
mermaid collection limited edition and
they're super affordable so overall
excited about it and let me put on some
eyelashes and we'll wrap this video up
alright guys this is the final look with
the eyes I think it turned out so cool
the only thing I would be a little bit
weird with it's a highlight because it's
a little bit of a gray hue on my face
which is kind of awkward to wear but I
will go in with a lighter hand and try
to work that out it was really pretty in
line anyways let me know down in the
comments section what you guys think
about this collection I'm really excited
about it as you get something cool we
hear a lot about unicorns but we don't
hear too too much about mermaids so I'm
excited for it and it's all really
affordable thank you guys so much for
