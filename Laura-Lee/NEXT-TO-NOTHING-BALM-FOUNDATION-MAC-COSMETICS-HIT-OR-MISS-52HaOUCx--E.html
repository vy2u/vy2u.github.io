I have for you guys right now and today
so subscribe to my channel before you
exit out of this video we'll go ahead
and jump right in and get started
checking in and get started first I want
to show you guys two shades I'm going to
be using medium dark because I got a
little Sun on my skin when I was in
nikkor island so they have these shades
right here not that you can see them all
right here they are it looks like
there's nine shades and they have three
different powders light medium and deep
and yeah here's a little glance over
basically this foundation is about the
skin and showing off the skin and so it
want an Instagram ready glow this is a
little press sheet that was sent because
obviously these were sent me I'm not
being paid to talk about them I just all
you guys might want to know about them
so I'm gonna review them for you anyways
it's called the next to nothing and
offers the newest innovations and
brilliance barely-there
makeup it can be worn under makeup or
alone so that's super interesting so you
can build it up v-12 you can smooth it
on with a brush or sponge it came
moisturize your skin and protect your
skin and diminish imperfections I mean
it is just a dream pro-rata it said the
face powder offers a cream
transformative lightweight formula for
long-lasting high comfort wear and says
it has a silky soft texture guaranteed
the look of radiant skin no filters
needed so foundation is going to cost 38
which is a little bit more than Mac
Studio Fix and in the powder is going to
cost $27 and it's going to launch April
the 6th I think this thing fans going to
so much April 6 in store and online I'm
going to prime my skin to start with I'm
going to prime my skin first I'm going
to be using the Korres Greek yogurt
smoothie primer it's just a nourishing
primer that I like a lot
by the way this is a scratch on my nose
my husband was petting my cat and then I
went to kiss my cat and his nail hooked
me and went right across the top of my
nose and I was like great
ok let's try to step out here's my skin
with no makeup on it and I have a little
blemish right there that I keep picking
out and right here that I keep
scratching I'm gonna take a medium to
dark shade and I'm going to pump them
out here's a good look at it for you
guys taking a little busted finger now
oh it's thick guys so it's always going
to be water it's not watery whatsoever
it's a super creamy formula Wow and it
smells just like the original Studio Fix
Mac foundation some people may hate that
but I'm obsessed with the smell of mac
lipstick and their foundation and and
their concealers like I love the way
their products smell isn't that strange
and just like all about it time well you
want my Beauty Blender hi and you my
Beauty Blender wet
no throw two blenders this is how much I
put on my skin and it just feels like
Studio Fix foundation to be honest with
you I'm this shape maybe a little bit
dark for me but I'm gonna still roll
with it
I got medium dark I got really excited
about my pan from Necker Island and I
may have gone overboard so I'm going to
use a blend beauty blender to blend this
out because the foundation feels thick
and it feels like it would work well
with a sponge it also says on the
pressed sheet that will work well with
sponge okay guys that was kind of
strange to me just a little bit and the
reason I say guys because the foundation
felt just like Studio Fix is the
thickness it blended out like Studio Fix
it smells like videos big but it looks
like I have no foundation on pretty much
I mean it almost it's kind of nothing to
my skin I mean I see a little bit like
luminosity I feel it's very light weight
it feels a little sticky I think it's
because it's still drying down a little
bit but I still see my skin straight
through it I am for I do I'm normally
full coverage girl but I am for a little
bit of skin showing sometimes I was
looking at my skin on nectar Island I
keep talking about that I'm so sorry I
was looking at my skin and I was like
you know what I need like wear less
makeup sometimes with it and like
appreciate the skin that I have so on
the island I didn't wear hardly anything
full coverage because I want to show off
my freckles and like have that moment
and I feel like that's what this
foundation is to do anymore me right now
I'm real interested to see how to wear
now of course I'm going to set it first
I'm going to apply a little bit of
concealer to see how we can slip plays
that with the product but I'm not going
to put on like too much product because
you know I really want to focus on the
foundation and how it looks on my skin
so let me add a little concealer and
we'll be right back okay guys I did the
rest of my makeup it's been about an
hour I'm gonna run to support I'm also
going tonight to see beauty in the
mousse and I'm going to see the movie
Beauty and the bees with Gabby Nikita
Jeffery and Manny and we're going
have a little girls night and go see
that movie okay and then I'll come back
after out all day and then at the movies
at night and eating dinner with everyone
and then we'll see what my face looks
like let's do this check-in right here
right now see what I look like
what's the four one one was good so just
a little heads up on the product let it
set there for a while like don't go
touching your face because what I did I
put the product on and then I said it
with the powder and then I got into my
magnifying mirror and I started looking
really deeply at my skin and I started
to freak out because I liked the product
was separating a little bit on my skin
after I put the powder on it but then I
started touching right here and I kind
of wiped the makeup off so I was like
 let me just leave it alone
and so that's what I did and then I
looked in the mirror at this cheek again
and this cheek looks normal
like it's not separating so I don't know
what the business is with that hopefully
it doesn't separate throughout the day
again we're going to do the wear test
and find out so let me write us before
real quick let me go eat dinner and let
me go to the movies let me go do the
whole thing and then I'll be back
alright guys I am back and I am ready to
wrap this video up you girl is tired and
ready to go to bed and so on take off
these lashes a foundation um it were
really nice leads throughout the day it
barely something to my smile lines
honestly that's not really an issue with
it I just love to get like all of my
magnifying mirror and I have a really
close look to see how it's looking on my
skin anything at a compliment on my
makeup today and how it looked I think
this is an actual great I approve this
foundation I think it's a great
foundation if you're into the very soft
natural sheer look this is this is where
it's at even the powder on top it still
doesn't really add much coverage it just
more so sets it so it lasts longer I
really don't have much bad things to say
about it I mean it just for nicely as
you see my forehead did not get greasy
whatsoever probably due to like the
formula of it's just so lightweight and
like it feels barely there so there's
not like much to it and it definitely
didn't think my skin greasy and I did
get hot I went out in the Sun I drove
around you know yadda yadda yadda I went
to movies it'll work and I have any
issues so I
we don't have anything bad to say about
it I mean it is what it says it is is
like a very light shear foundation if
you're a full-coverage girl this is not
for you if you're looking for something
new to show your skin off a little bit
more this summer lightweight it's not
going to feel heavy or get greasy this
is where it's ads it does not have
sunscreen in it so this is not going to
be like one of those lightweight
foundations to where the beach something
like X has no some protection but it is
great for everyday and work I believe
and I do love that the bottles like to
match my maker match master foundation
that has a pump on it for our heat and
thank you for that and here's the final
close-up of my face it really hung in
there mind you to the my I did set it
with a powder you I don't think you have
to buy the powder to set it with but I
think it's a good idea to set it with a
powder any foundation that you use just
to make it last longer yeah comment down
below based off what you see on my face
what do you guys think would you wear
this
are you a shear girl what do you think
or are you going to skip over this and
wait for something new fun and pull
covers to come out thank you guys so
much for being here I'm watching I hope
this review was helpful in making your
decision and to be more knowledgeable
about this foundation I love you guys so
much you guys are the best YouTube
family in the world
okay look Ric O'Barry and I'll catch you
all in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
