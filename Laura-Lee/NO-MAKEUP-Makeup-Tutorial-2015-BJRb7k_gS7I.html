hello different kind of makeup tutorial
then I'm like ever done ever and I
wanted this tutorial to be for the
person that wants to get into makeup and
wants to wear makeup but they just
aren't comfortable with a lot of makeup
and that heavy look or for the person
that simply is got to go chop chop and
they ain't got time for all the business
we're gonna be focusing on skin in this
tutorial because I feel like once you
get your skin covered girl you are ready
to roll you don't necessarily have to
wear eye makeup and lips every single
day yes I am so bad about doing it with
it I don't think it's something to be
bad about doing but it's what I love but
you know not everybody wants that so I
definitely wanted to create something
different that way everybody watching my
videos to get something out of it so I
definitely try to switch things up from
the norm you know people I got y'all I
got y'all and I'm gonna be using this
Alouette palette this is their brow
palette and this is how I did my brow
stuff helps you create more of a natural
eyebrow filled in look rather than like
a drone on eyebrow filled in look toen
doing and no makeup makeup you're not
gonna put any makeup on your eyes I
definitely recommend going with a little
bit more of a somewhat natural eyebrow
instead like the bold dronin brows we're
just gonna jump right in and we're gonna
get started and we're gonna do our no
makeup makeup
so as mentioned I'm gonna go in with a
picture-perfect browse by Alouette first
I like to dig my spoolie in the wax
which I know is weird but it does a
really good job and slicking down the
eyebrows because my eyebrows like to get
a little bit crazy I don't know about
yours that might get crazy then I'm
going to take the other end of the brush
and I'm going to slather it with a wax
on both sides now this brow powder comes
off really easy so I'm just gonna dip it
in the brow powder I use the shade
brunette and then I'm going to do a
feather-like motion and kind of lightly
dust the powder throughout my brows I
already have wax on them so it really
helps the powder to stick and I just
create like a pomade with the brow
powder and the wax and then I draw on
the brows and I don't know I just like
the color and the powder it just gives
it for more of a natural brow and then
I'll even run my spoolie through it
again just to brush through all of the
brow powder then going in with my viola
a facial primer my brain froze I'm going
to smooth this just in places that need
a little bit more a flawlessness
happening I normally just do it on my
cheeks right under my eyes and a little
bit on the nose then I'm gonna go in
with the Born This Way Foundation and
shade saying I have a review on it
doop doop yeah girl uh-huh and I'm gonna
blend this out with my f88 kabuki brush
from Sigma and this is gonna give our
skin so much warmth in color because my
face is really pill because I like to
protect it from the Sun and as you can
see yes we have lovely coverage I love
this foundation and it gives a good
natural finish to randomly in the middle
of this tutorial I decided I need to
condition my lips so I'm going in with
this it cosmetics lip conditioner I'll
have it linked down below because I
can't remember the exact name of it then
I'm going to conceal going in with a
really light hand I don't know why I put
the brush in the picture because it
ended up just using my fingers I'm gonna
pop this onto my under eye area and just
work it out with my fingers that's gonna
make us look really bright and awake and
it's gonna open up the eyes
doing the same thing to my other eye and
then if you have any areas that need
extra coverage like a blemish or any
redness I have a little bit of redness
around my nose so I'm just gonna pop a
little bit as I can till it right there
then I go in with this beautiful palette
by Alouette I'm just gonna take the
light shade I have greasy eyelids
sometimes especially in this summer so
basically I'm gonna highlight my brow
bone and apa' apply a little bit of the
powder to the eyelid just to help absorb
any grease and then I smooth it out
because we don't actually want any color
on our brows oh my god I love this
palette so then I'm going in with the
new NARS bronzer and the little baby
eita brush ETI de tomato tomahto you get
the point anyways I'm just gonna add
some color to the face because you have
to remember that your face being one
solid color isn't necessarily a natural
look because normally your face isn't
one solid color so I'm just gonna add a
little bit of bronzer to places where
the Sun naturally hits temples around
the forehead and I'm just gonna bring a
little bit around my cheeky I'm not
gonna lie the brush is really awkward to
hold because the handles so short then
I'm going in with this hot mama blush
I'm going in with a very light hand
because we're not really even trying to
add anything but like the slightest
flush that way we have like a natural
flush to our cheeks and again our face
isn't just like a solid color then I'm
going in with the bombs Marylou the
highlight and I'm going to take my
lovely ELF fan brush I'm gonna pop this
right onto that top points of my cheeks
this part is absolutely optional like
you don't have to have the glow I just
love the glow makes the skin look really
nice and soft so then I'm gonna go in
with like a dot of this hourglass lip
gloss and child it's just gonna add like
a touch of shine to our lips and guys
we're done
yep that's it can you believe it thank
you guys for watching check the down bar
for my social media and I hope to see
you in my next video I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
