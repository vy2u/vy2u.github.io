and oh my gosh I have never been this
excited for a video in my whole entire
life I am like oh my heart is beating so
fast guy it's like this video mm-hmm
it's just crazy because I'm out to show
you what I've been working on for
obviously so so so long and if you
follow me on my other social medias you
already kind of know about this and you
already know that I've been working on
this for a really long time if you don't
suppose here is my new collection from
larlie Los Angeles that I have created
so I have a couple different pieces to
this collection which is very exciting
the brand is growing and the brand is
expanding hallelujah I'm gonna like
expose everything that I've been hiding
from you guys for the past forever and
it feels so weird showing it to you guys
because all my brain has nolde is hide
it hide it hide it like every time I
have it out who stick it in a drawer
every time someone's snapping I grab it
and hide it that way it is a good you
know shown early now that I'm showing it
my brain just like wait this is wrong
hide it and I'm like no no we get shown
now it's cool girl it's cool I've never
been more proud of myself in my life and
I've never been happier about anything
they've ever created so let me just
start by saying that before I go too far
into detail about my feelings and the
creation of this collection let me sing
the SUBSCRIBE song honey because that is
our anthem be sure and subscribe and now
we're going to go ahead and jump right
into this video looking at nudie
patootie right here this is nudie
patootie this is an eyeshadow palette
this isn't absolutely a dream come true
if you're a neutral girl I'm gonna say
this thing nothing wrong with it okay
I'm a neutral girl I definitely have
played with color a little bit more on
my channel recently to kind of be well
more real well-rounded on my channel and
more of a beauty guru but my heart is
neutral colors and I always knew if I
had the opportunity to make a neutral
palette I would make the best chocolate
on earth I knew it and I truly think I
did every time I open it it truly takes
my breath away like I every time I open
it and just look at him like DiPaola is
everything it's 14 shades for 45 bucks
it has shimmers mattes and foiled
eyeshadows in it and with this new
patootie palette because I know there
are a lot of neutral palettes on the
market we're no stranger to that I chose
colors for this palette that aren't in
every neutral palette and colors that
aren't crazy colors but you could still
have some fun with it and do some jazz
up looks with there's also a couple
duochrome e colors in this palette but
yet they're still neutral so I made this
palette to have fun with but yet at the
same time get your neutral look and you
can use it for everyday
this is also an absolutely amazing
palette if you are having a wedding a
prom or a special event to get glam with
you can do a dark sultry eye you can do
a lot lights off peachy eye you can do a
sparkly gold glittery eye I mean the
looks from this palette is endless
you see exact same pan size they use for
cat's pajamas so if you're wondering the
size of the pans it is the exact same of
what I use for cat's pajamas name this
palette nudie patootie because nudie
patootie is literally a lowly language
it is how I talk I normally make up
words for things that aren't real petite
patootie awesome blossom nudie patootie
you'll see my makeup line I am creating
makeup that is not so much Laura Lee but
there are touches of Laura Lee oh and
within the makeup that's gonna be every
product to come out with is just gonna
have a touch of meat in it it has a nice
big mirror in it and I love the shape of
the palette because just so nice and
sturdy but yet slender and sleek it is
amazing for travel or you just keep your
makeup in your makeup bag this is
amazing for that also really pretty set
out on the vanity I'm sorry but the
package you give this makes my heart
melt into a puddle it is stunning we
have a matte ombre nude palette with a
clear gloss like latex clear glaze with
nudie patootie written really big and
then we have a rose gold foiled larlie
Los Angeles's logo on it and then the
inside the palette is rose gold as well
you also see detailing on the brim of
the palette this ll is our new emblem
every brand has an emblem they also have
a logo and emblem and a logo or two
different things this is our logo this
is our emblem so we have the emblem and
the logo if you open the palette it is
all rose gold
old really beautiful it makes the colors
even pop more sitting against the rose
gold and it also has the ll right below
the mirror just little fine details that
I absolutely adore and you know I think
they're just a must-have whenever it
comes to makeup I think it's such a sexy
chic palette this palette so much her
but yet still fun with the name of it
but when you look at it you're like ooh
yes mama give it to me that's hot that's
sexy I love it very much too
approachable and playful though I feel
like with the name of it and that was my
goals with this palette I made this
palette for everyone I made it pretty
young people I made it for more mature
people I made it for every skin tone
casts pajamas I listen to so much
feedback from you guys for people that
love really constructive criticism not
just criticism or not negativity it was
the people that truly left that I get
constructive criticism like I'm so proud
of you I really like this palette I
would like to see this isn't this my
eyes were open to you my ears were open
to you and the brand took all of that in
and we try to take as much criticism and
as much advice from you guys as we
possibly can we are listening to you and
we put it that into nudi patootie and I
really feel like you guys will see that
buddy who left negative comments or try
to tear me down I'm a young female woman
trying to be an entrepreneur and create
a business for herself and nothing's
gonna stop me so that which is truly
just weighed out and we weren't
listening to any of that negativity in
the world yet positivity in the world
you have a choice of which one you're
gonna listen to
I chose to listen to the positivity and
I truly think we came out on top that is
nudie patootie that I should pilot I'm
not just coming out that I should
palette I have more stuff than eyeshadow
palette coming out which I'm gonna be
talking about in this video but first I
want to go over the colors of nudie
patootie so that we can really dig into
this palette and you can even really see
what you're gonna get so I named all the
shadows after nude thanks or nude saying
in some way fashion or form because it
is a new palette so I really wanted
everything just okay the pots color is
stark this is a lighter wider color and
this was something that you guys asked
for whenever cats launched you guys
really we really want a shimmery color
for the brow bone or the inner color so
I was like okay go I got you is a very
light bright shimmery color will make
your brow bone pop it will make your
inner corner pop if you have a very
lighter skin tone it is a beautiful
cheek highlighter do you have a dress
this is a matte
like a honey nude shade I like to use
this to place it on top of all my
eyeshadow primers to kind of make it
less sticky I start every single look
with undress it is just a mandatory
color in the palette and I promise you
there's probably gonna be one of the
colors you'll hit pan on first and you
have topless this color is a really cool
way to use a dual comb do a reflective
color but yeah yeah in a neutral light
way so as a pink shade with a gold
reflective in it I like to pack this
creamy color all over my lid it's so
easy to use but when the light hits a
you get this reflective where it's like
pink but then it has this gold Sheen
over it it is sickening then you have
streaking this is more of a bisque
really nice neutral color this is the
perfect transition shade for any look
that you do again shrinking is probably
gonna be another color you'll hit pan on
really quick it's just that perfect
perfect khaki neutral brown shade that
fits right into the crease you can start
any makeup look with you have uncover
this is a pearly champagne color this is
your wedding day color honey or prom
look when you pop this on the lid I did
a look with the photo shoot with this on
the lid this color is crazy pigmented it
is like wow it really makes the eyes pop
and I think uncover is one of those
colors that looks good on any eye color
or any skin tone and I know you see it's
like there's normal champagne color but
we worked so hard on to be like the
perfect color to pop on the eye lid to
really make the eyes pop and go wow but
since it is still a champagne neutral
color it doesn't over take your look and
you can still focus on the beauty of
your actual eye but it has that pop to
it so if you're wondering what the heck
she changed clothes hair and makeup that
is what is my mic went out in the middle
of filming so this morning is my reveal
and I am refilling great when life
throws you lemons you just put on quick
makeup and refill my whole entire video
okay I was going over the shades in our
luscious gorgeous palette and I left off
right here with strip strip is a matte
golden mustard color it's such a
beautiful color to blend out into the
crease I literally am obsessed with
colors like this like neutrals with
yellow undertones to them it's so pretty
so that's uncover
and then that is stripped then we have
bear bear is a matte peach color very
pigmented you're gonna get a lot of
color off of this color and I think that
this wood color really gives the palate
some life and gives it a pop also in the
photo shoot we use bear for blush for
every single person and it was so
beautiful you guys know I love a peachy
blush so this is like my go-to blush
color right now this is what bear it
looks like a little swatch aru's ear I
tear my finger and that is what she
looks like on the skin she's such a
pretty peach shade then we have exposed
exposed and uncover kind of looks
similar the power palette but they're
actually quite different exposed to more
of a pewter color with a bit of sparkle
into it and then uncover is more sort of
a lighter champagne it's actually a lot
lighter than exposed but whenever
they're in the palette together you're
like are those colors the same but
really let me swatch and show you all
right so if you can see here exposed as
a pewter has a brown undertone shimmer
to it and then this one has just like a
white base champagne color and they're
both beautiful but this one is a bit
deeper than uncover then you have
all-natural all-natural is a gold foiled
eyeshadow I did can put a picture up
online comparing these to the gold and
bronze shade in cat's pajamas and they
are quite different on that shirelle is
foiled so you're gonna get more fallout
with a foiled shadow but you are gonna
get max pigmentation and I recommend you
guys wearing this color wet or applying
it wet with a wet brush or with your
finger packing it on or with a glitter
glue underneath and this is gonna help
you get the least amount of Fallout and
get the max pigmentation out of this
product oil shadows are really amazing
and really fun to work with and they
really make your eyes come to life
whatever you do don't go in with any of
the shimmer shades with a fluffy blender
because that is just a recipe for
disaster and color flying everywhere
hello use your finger or synthetic flat
brush so here's a swatch of all natural
it's one of my favorite shades in the
entire palette I'm a gold girl and this
gold has a bit of a deeper bronzy look
to it so it's not too bright it's really
a great neutral gold shade then we ever
ville is a great brown color it is like
a quirky color really great of as a
deeper transition
or if you just want to intensify your
look a little bit with this brown shade
or to build it up upon other Browns
reveal is a great color to do that with
this is what it looks like on my skin
tone it's really pretty
next we have Jay bird Jay bird is also
one of my favorite colors in the palette
a bird I really like the foils in this
palette they make the palette come to
life this color has a lot of sparkle to
it it is a duochrome
it is like a fiery pink red but when the
light hits it you see this gold
reflective into it and it is insane it's
the same as all natural it is a foiled
shadow therefore just apply it with your
finger apply it wet or with a glitter
glue so you don't have to fall out with
it but you're gonna get the intense max
pigmentation out of jaybird you guys see
like there's like this golden reflected
like look at the top part of my hands
gold with the light hits it in the
bottom of the parts that fiery red
nothing insane how the color changes
look it looks like a gold eyeshadow
right here and now it's like a red
eyeshadow I love it and this is the part
of the pie I really wanted to have fun
with and like add just like a touch of
color but in the best neutral way so the
palette still made sense if you're
wondering why the color is called a
jaybird in the south a way to describe
someone my mom always described people
being naked as naked as a jaybird like
that's such a common saying in the south
so jaybird is the name of it and like I
said like these palettes anything could
come out with this always gonna have a
touch of larlie in it yeah but naked
this is our warmer brown shade in the
palette it is a bit deeper it's one of
our darker Brown because it has this
warmth to it that looks really beautiful
in the eyes anytime I use this palette I
always happen to butt naked either
running across the lower lashline or
blend it up into this crease which is
what I have on today also have uncover
in the center if you guys can see how
the light catches uncover and just look
at the side trying to water go you
better stop here is butt-naked right
here so you guys can see it's a nice
matte brown shade but it has a warmth to
it and if you can see in that swatch
sorry I have a little j-bird left over
but that swatch how creamy a matte
shadow is like it's so creamy you have
buff oh you need a deep chocolatey Brown
but I added a little bit of sparkle and
this one to give us some bossess it's
not just like a shimmery chocolate brown
it has like a little to it it's so
pretty on the eyes if you want to do a
deep
smokey eye and I think it does even
though the color so deep I do still see
a little bit of warmth that comes out
within the color guys can see the
sparkle in it like the little twinkles
that come out make the eyes light up and
then it has a little bit of warmth to it
it's color sickening and last but not
least there's this mandatory color
called Nikki Nikki in the palette it is
our deepest color in the palette is a
deep rich chocolate brown that is matte
and again this is another color that I
just happened to my pencil brush and
almost incorporate it and every look I
do with this palette it's so easy to use
too and creamy sometimes matte Browns
can get dry and chalky but this one is
so intensely creamy and so easy to blend
out that you don't have to be scared to
tap into it and it only takes a little
bit of the color because it is extremely
pigmented literally look at that rich
chocolate brown this is her right here
just a really pretty deep brown color
their lunches palette on the 24th which
is next Tuesday at 2 p.m. PST on Laura
Lee Los Angeles calm which is my website
it will later on then be available on
beautybay calm on morphe brushes calm as
well as in every single morphe brushes
store my products are vegan their
cruelty free and they are made in the
United States of America so that is not
all with this collection oh I just can't
quit looking attic also of course you
get your little piece of me or protector
in here that protects the mirror from
the eyeshadows and then this is the
unicorn that it will come in is very
beautiful very beautiful darling okay we
also have liquid lipsticks I have three
liquid lipsticks I'm gonna drop I'm so
excited and my formula is bomb honey
with my formula I hate dry liquid
lipsticks that feel really tight on your
lip and it feels like your lips are
gonna bust open and then I hate formulas
there are two goopy and never dry down
and then they come off and they don't
they're not very long wearing so I bet
in the middle of my liquid lipstick
formula and it does whenever you put it
on it feels really comfortable you get a
lot of pigmentation it takes a little
couple of minutes to drive it once it
dries down it still has like this
flexibility in it where it's not gonna
crack or bust open but it's very long
wearing also my liquid lipsticks girl
they smell like sour candy apples
yes honey so around Halloween time do
you ever get those greens sucker
the caramel anime you smell them and
it's like pure heaven that is what they
smell like smelly sour candy apple but I
made it very important that they don't
aren't too powerful to smell was the too
powerful so whenever you put it on your
lips you really don't smell the scent
you only smell it if you take a little
sniff Eruzione
doe foot applicator it smells so good
I'm like addicted to smelling them I
sniffed them all the time like every
time I smell them it smells so sweet and
takes me back to those times growing up
as a kid with the little suckers
absolutely adore it
so I love candy smells and that's kind
of what I wanted a really sweet smell
with my liquid lipsticks I don't like
overpowering smells they give me a
headache throughout the day so just make
it very important that the smell wasn't
in them whenever you have it on your
lips you don't want to walk around
having your face smell like a sour candy
apple all day or do you I don't know
have three shades these are gonna be
sixteen bucks a piece first shade is a
lighter bear nude shade first shade is
called Nikki Nikki it is a lighter bear
nude it's such a pretty shade like
Eisley obsessed with it the next shade
is a pinky nude is called topless I wear
that shade every single day of the week
as opposed to so many Instagram pictures
with it on and everybody asked me what
color it is and now I can finally tell
you it's topless and then also jaybird
which is a deeper brown undertone nude
it is so freakin beautiful this is a
deeper nude I'm really easy to wear to
all these colors are just so incredibly
easy to wear they're just nude that go
with the collection one downside to this
is I decide to have my package custom
made instead of stock made so whenever
it's stock you just pull it and you make
it or there you can like custom make
your own packaging which takes a lot
more time and a lot more money I was
like you know what my liquid lipstick
packaging I wanted to be sickening and
original so we're having custom made
therefore the liquid lipsticks will not
launch until May which we only have a
few more weeks
anyways till May so they're launching
soon but they're not gonna launch with
the palette unfortunately I wanted that
to happen more than anything but I just
couldn't make it happen so liquid
lipsticks launched in May
palette launches on the 24th of April
also are coming out with eyeliners yes
honey we got the ball rolling I told you
guys we
coming out with some good stuff so we
have two eyeliners who have been nude in
a black which I think compliment the
palette so nicely these as well we will
be launching in May and what took so
long with these was the formula it took
me forever because they are very long
wearing but they glide on really easily
whenever you want the best of both
worlds it takes a lot of time to create
that so these are the eyeliners the
packaging is very pretty it's matte
black and then so this is the black one
so the ins black this is the nude one so
the end of it is nude and then we will
extend the line of course and you'll see
the color of the liner at the base of
the pencil this is a retractable pencil
has a sharpener in the bottom of it and
the lid has the rose gold logo on it
super pretty sleek beautiful eyeliner
packaging these are the only liners I
wear I wear them every single day like I
love them they're the best
well announce that day as soon as I have
that day and I should have it pretty
soon so be sure you're following
laura-leigh los angeles on instagram
because that is where i'm like releasing
all the updates on stuff so yeah we have
a lot common honey bunny
that is the nudie booty collection I
wish they were all launching together
but I'm so proud of this collection I
think it's so beautiful I can't wait for
you guys see the liquid lipstick
packaging if I had even a sample other
girl would show you right here right now
but the labs are pumping it out as fast
and as hard as they can so just know
soon as I have a sample I will be
showing it so be sure to mark your
calendars 24th
2 p.m. PST time which is 5 o'clock
Eastern Time 6 no 4 o'clock Central time
and then 2 o'clock
LA PST time so what do you guys think
about this highlighter a lot of things
so now we're gonna jump into the makeup
tutorial and I'm gonna show you guys how
I got a golden smoky eye with this
palette I will do a lot more looks with
this palette don't worry this isn't only
look this spotlight smokey eye is really
beautiful I'll show you guys how I got
in a video or if you guys have any
requests on particular colors please
leave it down below that you want me to
use and now let's go do some makeup
alright here is the look we are doing
today it is a golden eye it's one of my
favorite looks I do with this palette so
I figured I was show you snow I'm gonna
be showing you it's hotter look
palate so if you want into a gold I
don't worry more looks or coming soon
another one my favorite looks to do this
palette is a peachy smoky eye it's so
pretty okay so but let me go ahead and
start with the golden eye I'm gonna take
undress this is the M 573 brush and this
color is just so easy to use you can
just flip it and flop it around your eye
I like to use it to soften up any
eyeshadow primer that's down and to
really start the look I start every look
I do with undressed at this same brush
I'm gonna go into streaking this color
is again another easy one to use but I
like to use streaking as my transition
shade it works so beautifully right into
the crease so I typically take streaking
and just blend it back and forth back
and forth until streaking just adds a
little bit of a deeper color so it's
actually a transition shade I'm gonna
keep this color kind of below since we
are doing a dark smoky eye and I just
don't want to take the Browns up too
high that way they're not like touching
my brow bone I'm going to happen to
reveal on r39 brush and this is the part
we really start to build up the color
reveal is a bit of a deeper color deeper
brown color it's quite the neutral Brown
looks good on every skin tone this is a
really amazing color to use now I'll go
into butt-naked which this is a really
pretty a slightly warmer brown but it's
not like that super warm toned brown
color I love building up all the Browns
in this palette they're so easy to use
together they're so easy to build up you
don't have to build them up in a
specific or rhyme or reason way like you
can just tap in tap in tap in and go to
town with them and every time it really
turns out beautiful but you get like a
kind of a different ending with your
brown tone look next I'll go into nakey
nakey which is our deepest most
chocolate brown and I really like hide
this onto the outer corner of the lid
and then just a really softly blend it
in I like to keep this color tight and
in because it's such a deep chocolatey
color once all that's down I'll now add
a little bit of glitter glue right here
to the lid which really helps
boiled all natural color to stick on
really well and to have its maximum
pigment or you can just simply wet the
shade whatever you prefer
next I'm gonna take on this little
pencil brush the darkest shade Nicki
Nicki and I'm just gonna run it on the
edge just to deepen up the crease a
little bit and then I'll just kind of
right there in the crease to define
where the gold cuts I'm gonna take the
liner and just run it right across the
edge so that way my thoughts lashes do
not there's not like that wait there's
not a gap between my real Imbolc lashes
or my lower lash line I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of streaking and then
I'll mix reveal in streaking and then
I'll just start blending that and then
I'll just start blending that from inner
to outer corner gonna take nakey nakey
and I'm gonna keep it a little bit
tighter to the lash line because it's a
darker color but I'm just gonna blend
that from inner to outer corner as well
to really smoke out and I also added
some of the black liner into the what to
lie I'm gonna take stark on an m40 one
brush and just pop it in the inner
corner as well as the brow bone to give
it a little bit of a highlight all right
this is the look I paired with the look
because this is such a deep sultry eye
I put Nikki Nikki on the lip color which
I think looks absolutely stunning
that way you have a soft matte nude lip
and then you have a more dark sultry eye
again I'll be doing tons and tons and
tons of looks with this palette but this
is like no finish is a collection and I
just wanted to leave you guys with a
positive message and a lot of you guys
