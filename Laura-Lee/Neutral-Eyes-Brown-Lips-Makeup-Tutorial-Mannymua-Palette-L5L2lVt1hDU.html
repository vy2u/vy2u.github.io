video is going to be this makeup look
that you see here other than the brown
lips this is pretty much my go-to makeup
look I did indeed use the where's it err
my an emu a palette where he collab with
makeup geek this palette supposed to be
back and stop this week like right now
when I'm filming yet so hopefully we'll
be in stock by the time this video goes
live if it is not in stop by the time
the video goes live I will list colors
down below that are super similar by
makeup geek that way you can still
recreate the look I use pretty neutral
colors in the Pat and the from the
palette anyways for this look so it's
not going to be too difficult to
recreate if you don't have the palette
or if you can't get the palette Asset
Oriole that I did um like the way I did
the eyeshadow is super similar however
this look is a little bit easier to less
involved in easier to create there's not
somebody show you to use and this is a
much more wearable look because I know
some people aren't a big fan of like a
lot of color so these are very neutral
shades I think these shades would look
absolutely gorgeous on any person
whatever you have I feel like this look
with a bomb Devi on you so hope you
enjoyed the tutorial we're gonna jump
right in and get started my hair is
stuck to my background do you see it
move in that's cuz like a piece of hair
stuck um yeah let's do the tutorial
alright first things first I'm the
realest just kidding that was cheesy
I'll never say that again so I'm going
to start off with primary my face I did
use the makeup forever skin equalizer
and this one is the hydrating one
whenever I use a hydrating product I
typically just apply it all over the
face then when I go in with my Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD I can't remember the
color that I have so I'll put it in the
description box but I'm going to be
blending this out on my face with my
artist brush this is the oval-8 these
brushes are super duper cool I use them
all the time if you follow me on
instagram you already know that but um
it just blends out the makeup so easy
peasy lemon squeezy as you can probably
see what I'm doing right here
I just softly brush it around my face
and it gives you that flawless even
finish however just a warning they do
absorb a lot of your product
jumping in with my mini palette I'm
going to start off with beaches and
cream
which is a cream shade I'm just going to
dust this all over with a sigma e40
brush just to soften up the eyeshadow
primer which is going to make our life
easier in the long run then I'll go in
with Sora it's a nice warm e orangie
undertone brown color and I'm going to
use this as our transition shade and I'm
blending that in with an e25 by Sigma
use this brush in every tutorial so you
guys probably already know it's going to
use it I'm blending in these colors
super super soft and the softer you
blend the softer your shadow is going to
turn out and I definitely want my
transition shade just to be really light
and gradient and soft so be gentle with
your transition shade then I'm going to
go in with frappe which is just a wee
bit of a darker color than Sora so now
we're just building up color and I'm
basically placing it in the exact same
place that I put my transition shade I'm
just putting it in the outer corner and
then working that on into the crease
next up I'm gonna go in with Aphrodite
which is a nice chestnut dark brown
color and I'm going to blend that into
the outer corner I'm definitely going to
use just a tiny bit of color and just
work it in and grab a little bit more
color and work it in instead of going in
with a fully-loaded brush we discuss
this and my eyeshadow do's and don'ts I
just posted um you just whenever you go
in darker colors yous going to be way
more careful about the amount of product
you're applying then I'm just going to
take a clean fod brush and we're going
to soften up those edges it's okay if
you took it out too far we'll clean that
up in a momento momento that a word
minute anyways I'm just going in with a
matte black color just to deepen it up a
little bit more this is completely
optional but I just wanted my outer
corner to be a smidge darker so I took a
dot of a matte black eye shadow is
corrupt by makeup geek and apply it to
the outer corner now I'm going to go in
with Artemis and I'm going to apply that
to the lid with a flat shader brush to
pack on that color I take it cover about
75% of the lid and then stop in that
outer corner and then I decided to go in
with Luna which is an absolutely
gorgeous shimmery pinky color and I
popped that right on top because I
didn't want it to be too bright on the
lid and I just take my dirty ol e25 and
blend together where the eyeshadows meet
next time I'm going to be going in with
my Sigma wicked liner they quit selling
the morphe black liner on the site
already had a fit about it and it's not
there so I'm moving on I'm totally going
to Wang it out I have a winged liner
tutorial so I've set you guys up for
success and then I'm going to clean up
those outer edges like I told you guys I
would with a makeup call then I'm going
to take that light color again called
Artemis and apply it to the brow bone
being sure just used tiny bit of color
because this is a super shimmery shade
and it's just going to tie the whole
look together
next up is for mascara and I will be
adding palsies but if you don't want to
add falsies you already know what I'm
going to tell you to do just build up
that mascara girlfriend next up is for
concie Leah I'm going to be adding my
mac prolongwear concealer and I'm just
applying that to my face in a really
weird way making weird faces I'm just
having fun okay guys and I'm going to
blend it out with this tapered kabuki
brush I like it because it's tapered it
can get right up in that inner corner of
the eye and you can just tap tap-tap and
blend it out and that way it looks
flawless and pretty now I'm going in
with my morphe 9 C palette and I just
mixed together the banana shades and I
press them into the concealer that way
it sets it really well and stops it from
creasing and it also makes it last
longer just kind of gives you that nice
flawless finish it also has a nice pinky
shade in this palette too if you are not
a yellow undertone so I've just been
loving this palette then I also have
been contouring my face with this
palette like every single day and this
isn't a I can't remember one the number
of this brush but I really like it to
contour my face and the shade is just a
really nice cool matte brown color which
is perfect for contouring and I'm also
going to contour the nose you know we
can't leave the nose hanging next up is
for the blush
I've used this blush in so many
tutorials I need you to just move on and
stop but it adds just like this perfect
pinch of color to my cheeks
this is quarter rosa aurora brush by
sigma and just with that angled brush
I'm just going to pop that onto the
apples and blend it on back now for my
highlighter I am busting out my
champagne pop by Jacqueline Hill I'm
doing all kinds of collabs like in this
video Jacqueline Hill
eggs Becca cosmetics and I'm going to
pop that on to the upper cheekbone area
run a wee bit down the nose and brush a
little too that Cupid's bow
well really all over my upper lip then
I'm going to go in with Sora and blend
that on to the lower lash line just to
finish up the eyes and then I'll take
Aphrodite which is the dark brown color
and this nice flat definer brush and
push it right into the lower lash line
that way we're not dragging the dark
color down too low make sure you make a
really weird face to do this next up I'm
going to go back in with Luna again and
pop it into the inner corners just to
open the eyes a little bit going in with
my Laura Geller waterproof eyeliner
which is an awesome eyeliner for the
waterline because it stays because it's
waterproof and it's just black then I'm
going to coat those lower lashes with a
bit of mascara and we're going to be
adding true bound to true true Brown by
kylie jenner to my lips for my brown
color now I will add a bunch of dupes
for this in the description box because
it's always sold out so you can still
get your brown lip on you know I got you
covered and lastly don't forget to
spritz a gallon of mac fix+ spray onto
your face thank you guys so much for
watching be sure to subscribe for you we
leave in yeah I'll see you next video
