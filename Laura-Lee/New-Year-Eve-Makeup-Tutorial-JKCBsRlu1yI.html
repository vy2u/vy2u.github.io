video is going to be this graphic liner
with a bold lip it is perfect for the
holidays her favorite Christmas perfect
for date night all this holiday parties
and or even New Year's Eve it would be
absolutely gorgeous to wear to things I
didn't cut my hair high ponytail and the
background is very temporary just for
this video I thought I would change it
up just for the video will be back to
the normal background ASAP for those of
you who don't care for the plain black
background I get it we're gonna jump
right in and get started I am so excited
for you guys to see this look of course
I'm excited for you guys to see this
look umm yeah so let's jump right in and
get started and don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy
add a little bit of concealer to these
two spots on my face dealing with some
breakouts guys just bare with me next
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add a little
bit of concealer to my eyelid and just
use that as an eyeshadow primer I'm
gonna go in with a little bit of primer
this is the professional by benefit and
I'm just gonna apply it to areas that
need a little bit more pore coverage and
it's just gonna smooth those out
Billy excited to use this foundation
this tutorial is the Neutrogena skin
clearing complexion Perfector I'm using
shade light to medium number 30 this is
a brand-new concealer this is a brand
new foundation from Neutrogena
it's really nice foundation and I am
super excited to be using it as
salicylic acid in it which is absolutely
perfect for me today because y'all the
breakouts are not a joke lately so now
I'm just gonna start blending that out
all over my skin just a heads up this
foundation will be on shelves in January
so if you want to get it or try it out
you can and it is a sheer coverage
foundation next I'll be going in with
this little eyeshadow palette from
Neutrogena this is their nourishing long
wear eyeshadow and I'm gonna go in with
these neutral cream shade and I'm just
gonna kind of blend it all over as I do
in every tutorial this just softens up
that primer I put down or that base as
far as the eyeshadow in this tutorial is
just gonna be easy peasy lemon squeezy
because we're gonna focus on the
eyeliner but next I'll go in with a
little bit of this taupey brown shade
I'm actually gonna mix these two and I'm
just gonna pop that really light into
the crease
I'm just going to add a touch of fudge
bionis Tashia beverly hills into this
crease right here just to warm it up a
little bit
very little eye shadow used now we'll
focus on a little bit of liner I'm gonna
go in with this Sigma wicked liner it's
just a black gel liner and an E tin
eyeliner brush it's like a little bit
baby pencil I'm going to create just my
usual winged liner in this tutorial
now for the glitter part I just have a
little bit of glitter on that same
eyeliner brush and I'm just gonna go
from about a quarter of the way all the
way to the tip at the top of the liner
with the glitter trying to be as calm as
a cucumber but we all know I'm not a
very calm person so you're seeing a new
side of me so the glitter ended up
coming down a little bit low and I did
go back in with a little bit of that
black liner just to clean it up and then
I went in with my makeup forever
concealer and just highlight at my face
in the usual areas you guys know this
routine now I'll just blend all that out
with my trusty kabuki I'm gonna go in
and set all of that with this mineral
power from Neutrogena and it also has
salicylic acid in it so please help the
zits on my face go away I'm just gonna
go crazy and put it all over my face I
go in with a little bit of this color
called Java I'm just gonna contour out
those cheekbones
now I'm gonna go in there with a little
bit of this rocket or blush and pop this
on to the apples of my cheeks give me a
little glow I'm gonna go in in highlight
the face because you know a girl's that
I get her glow on so I'm just gonna go
in with this new rosy glow highlight
from Too Faced and pop that on to the
high points of the cheeks
under I going back to this palette I'm
gonna grab a little bit of that medium
brown color and just blend it right
below the under eye I'm gonna take this
definer brush go in with a deeper color
and smudge it right at the lash line
now I'm just going to add a touch of
that glitter to the inner corner
and very carefully I'm gonna add a
little bit of mascara to the lower
lashes trying not to knock any of that
glitter off it probably wouldn't have
hurt for me to do my mascara first I'm
gonna go ahead and do those upper lashes
as well I did add false lashes I use
temptress by house of lashes they aren't
to fluttery it but they look gorgeous
with this holiday look and for my lips I
use my friend kathleenlights liquid
lipstick in Havana nights it's such a
gorgeous color you go girl I love this
color so much and as you can see I am
applying it with a brush to be super
precise with this bold color and lastly
this makeup remover by nature Gina is a
cleansing all they uses good-old to
remove bad oils from your skin and it is
great to remove your makeup at the end
of the night well thank you guys so much
for being here I'm watching I love you
guys so so so much thanks again I hope

up if you do and let's all pray I don't
have lipstick all over my teeth talking
