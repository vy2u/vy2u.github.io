mascara and it's a long story but just
wait to apply your mascara first I'm
gonna go in with the hangover RX and use
this as my facial primer it is winter
time and I am dry dry dry
then I'm going in with my Dior skin and
I'm blending this out with my 3d angled
kabuki brush from Sigma and I'm just
being sure to blend this out in the way
that the hair grows on the face next I'm
going in with this orange smoothie color
from makeup geek and I'm just blending
this in the crease I already have my
eyelids prime and just let you guys know
this just makes everything easier to
blend out next I'm going in with Coco
bear or cocoa bean by makeup geek and
I'm blending this in the upper crease
area being sure just to focus it right
in that upper crease not really blending
it downward next I'm gonna take this NYX
black gel liner and this angled brush
and basically I'm gonna pack this all
over the lid you don't have to create a
perfect smooth line with it because
we're gonna blend that out right here
and I'm using this brush from morphe
here it is just soften up that line
because it is a little bit harsh the
reason I went with NYX gel liner is
because it's a rather sticky gel liner
and that's just what I wanted then going
in with any matte black any Mac any
matte black eyeshadow that you have in a
tiny brush you can use a pencil brush
you can just blend this part right into
the crease then I'll go in with this
galactic glue color and I know it's
weird but you can't really tell it's
blue it just adds a pop of color and I'm
pop that right somewhere that lines
really harsh with the black stop and I'm
just gonna blend that out and make
everything look really gradient step is
extremely important you don't have to go
with the blue color you can just stick
with the matte it color if you want next
going in with a highlight for my brow
bone area don't neglect your brow bone
but then don't add too much of a
highlight because taking pictures the
flash it's gonna pick that up and you
will look cry cry because it'll make you
look like you have really white on top
of your brow bone area
next I'm gonna gel down my brows because
as we saw before I have loose hairs that
are out on the run and we gotta stick
those bad boys into place
then I'm going in with some glitter I'm
using Mac's black glitter you can use
any color or any eye glitter that you
have or water to apply this I'm using my
mac fix+ spray makes it stick on but
yeah it's just taking this small
synthetic brush you're going to have
fallout when applying glitter so as
you've noticed I am NOT doing my
concealer yet I am brushing away all the
fallout right now and then I'm gonna do
my concealer using my Maybelline age
rewind concealer and then I'm gonna
going in with my prep and prime pin from
the Mac this is a bright forecast I'm
gonna focus on highlighting my face just
to brighten up everything and pushing
out areas that I want to be lighter then
I'm gonna contour with a cream contour
because you guys this is a nighttime
look and so it's gonna be heavier and
basically I show you in this video
filing how I've learned that out with my
3d kabuki brush first I'm gonna blend
out that concealer and all of my
highlight really will I'm using at 57
brush from Sephora taking my time to
make sure everything is super seamless
there's no harsh lines you don't ever
want to be able to tell one color starts
and one clear stops you just want it to
all brilliantly flow together
now going in with that 3d kabuki brush
I'm pushing the color upward into my
skin yes like that so I'm gonna work it
back and forth and basically I'm really
kind of aggressively pushing that color
upward and then I bring it around the
hairline area and buff it into my temple
being sure everything is just blended
out I'm in fast mode but believe me this
does take a long time doing the nose
area it worked well for me with this big
brush but if you want to use a smaller
brush it might work a little bit better
per se and then you never want to put
this much makeup on your face and not
set it so I'm using this Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder you can grab
any and chances it's heavy power you
have and push it into the skin and then
buff away the excess
going in with a little bit of extra
drama I'm going with this Physicians
Formula bronzer just to deepen up that
contour you can completely skip this
step I know I'm dramatic but hey it's
New Years Eve and it is the time to go
cray-cray with your makeup so now I'm
going in with warm soul by Mac this
blush color and then I'm gonna do a
super dramatic highlight I'm going in
with BB lumination first from Gerard
cosmetics blending that out just my
fingertip and then on top of that I'm
gonna go in with opal by Becca cosmetics
and with a little brush here I'm just
gonna sprinkle that right on top of that
BB lumination this is gonna give us that
extra SuperDuper glow and there is no
better time to rock this hardcore
highlight then New Year's Eve night now
we're gonna focus on the lower lash line
I'm using that same NYX gel liner and
I'm buffing it into the lower lash line
being sure to get it really tight up
close to the lashes and then I'm gonna
go in with the Coco bear color I'm gonna
blend that out this is gonna warm up the
lower lash line area that way we don't
look like a panda and everything's
really soft next I'm gonna go in with
just like tiny as possible amount about
blue color and I'm gonna help blend out
that black and then I went back in with
the cocoa bean color to warm it up one
more now it's time to set everything
this helps lock and load all the colors
and it also enhances the highlight in
the blush I'm using stripped down for my
lip liner because we are gonna do new
lips due to the fact that our eyes are
super heavy but I didn't want my lips to
be completely blanked out so going in
with stripped down to give it an ombre
brownish nude effect
I'm loving this lip pencil you guys you
gotta get your hands on it as far as my
nude I do go in with a myth by Mac and I
fill in the areas now as you can see
there's kind of harsh line so I do going
back in with a synthetic brush and I
just pull down and blend out all the
colors that way it looks really
nice and soft on the lip so lashes we
cannot forget on lashes ladies I'm gonna
add double up lashes this is number 203
by ardell lashes and a little bit of
lash glue you want to be sure to get
that lash line is possibly as close to
your real lashes as possible that way it
won't look prey and you won't be able to
really tell that you're wearing fake
lashes although you are obviously
wearing fake lashes and we're gonna load
up on the mascara even though I already
have mascara on and basically just
touching up my mascara now but as for
you who will not have appear on yet go
ahead and load up those lashes with your
favorite mascara now it is time for the
hair as for my hair I'm going to show
you how to do this sleek ponytail with a
pouf in the front basically my camera
wasn't recording when I did this part so
I'm pretending to do it over again I
take four sections of hair right at the
top and crown in my head hairspray
teased hair sprays teeth basically doing
the same process over again I also don't
like to spray hairspray around my camera
lens because we all know that can be a
failure so then I take this crazy amount
of hair and I just clip it we're gonna
ignore it right now we're gonna focus on
the side I'm gonna work on sleeking down
this side I'm gonna pout on a lot of
hairspray that I'm gonna take this Bruce
Lee brush this is a teasing brush and
I'm gonna really really tightly tie down
those sides of hair spring and then just
making sure it looks really sleek and
super tight to my head and basically I
take that part of my hair you just throw
it up in a ponytail and it collects the
top half as for now I don't know why I
just clip out you don't take the clips
out yet but just put this part in a
ponytail in your hair right now that way
that is out of the way and then we're
gonna work on the pouf now everybody's
head size and shape is differently so
just fix your pouf as you big as you
want it and as you can see here I twist
the pouf in the back and then I push it
forward and then I'm gonna clip it in
with some bobby pins that I use about
four bobby pins be sure to get bobby
pins that are the color of your hair
because you don't want them feed that
obvious because they are gonna show
so basically that's what I'm doing now
we'll smooth out those sides in just a
moment so at this point you can take
that left over here wrap it around your
rubber band but as for me because oh and
here I'm fixing my poop a little bit too
got a little cray-cray look see and I'm
gonna sleek down all these baby hairs a
little bit of hairspray and then this
same te brush that has nice bristly
bristles on it I have this pony tail
this is the princess pony tail from
luxury for princess it is so glam you
guys so of course I had to put it in my
hair I'll have it linked down below if
you guys are interested in it but you
basically you just clip the little piece
in and then at the velcro so this part
velcro's to that part I'm really good at
explaining this I know and you it gives
you the extra piece to wrap around so
it's actually really easy to put into
your hair the lights make it look a
little bit lighter than my natural hair
color but in sunlight it matches my
natural hair color so this is our final
look I really hope you guys enjoy thank
you for coming to my channel and
watching and I hope you have the best
New Year's of all time thank you guys I
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
