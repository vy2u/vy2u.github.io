you
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a makeup tutorial
obviously you saw that when you clicked
on it but I just got this palette this
is the Smashbox double exposure palette
super interesting little palette we have
here and I didn't know it was this
interesting until I started reading on
it but this is a super cool tone palette
has a lot of pretty purpley colors in it
then it has a couple neutrals to go with
but when I got this palette this comes
in it this little piece of paper and it
shows how each and every color um
you wet you can wet them and you get a
darker or more pigmented darker color
every time you wet one you can even with
the matte ones I've never went a matte
eyeshadow for but it says here you can
with them and it says that they won't
glaze over and they won't you know be
weird and have that film on them after
you what them is the little review on it
so it comes to 14 shades which is a lot
of shades for one eyeshadow palette and
then like I said you can wet them and
then they're supposed to get like a
completely darker color so it can turn
into like 28 shades and it comes with
this little double ended brush yeah it's
really nice brush i've used smashbox
brushes before and you also get a little
mini mascara which um I've used this
mascara before as well and I love it
super big bristly brush on it so that's
what the palette comes with when you get
it you get the mascara the brush in the
poet oh I just let you guys know I have
this new thing going I will be
live-tweeting the first hour my videos
go live so if there's anything you want
to say to me you want to stop by and say
hey just shoot me a tweet and we will
chat it up my friends we will chat it up
my sweater handle is Laura 88 late super
easy to remember is also linked to the
description box also everything I use in
all my satorious are always linked in
the description box including most
atomic but what I'm wearing just in case
you guys are wondering but that's all
the blabbering
right now you're probably like we get on
with a total radio call Fran we can and
we will let's get started to start off
this tutorial I'm going to begin with my
boldface here and then we're going to
win and prime our skin with the master
Prime at Maybelline and I'm just gonna
push this into my skin just adding it to
places that need a little bit of
smoothing out I always recommend using a
primer but just fine which whatever one
works for you and your pretty little
face then going it with my favorite
drugstore foundation as mentioned in my
previous video I'm going to give it a
good shake and blend it out with my damp
and a Beauty Blender I love my Beauty
Blender but sometimes I don't use it
because I'm too lazy to go wet it and
that is just pathetic but it's the truth
once that's blended out we're going to
work on the eyes first women go in with
fig and I'm just going to put a little
bit of this on the end of this fluffy
brush and I'm going to work it in that
outer V only notice I'm going to be
strategically placing these colors onto
my lid little by little and taking a
whole lot of time to blend also another
thing with this palette I learned is
that the more you push and blend these
colors they get a little bit darker so I
really like that about it and they have
super high pigmentation so just a
warning just go in with the taut little
dot of color then going in with tempera
I'm going to add this right on top just
to deepen up that outer beef I'm using
the exact same brush doing the exact
same motions
packing it on and doing a little bit of
swiping motion to blend it out we want
everything to be super soft and super
gradient then I'm going to go in with a
clean fluffy brush and I'm going to
blend all this out the more colors you
add the more time
you need to take blending that way
everything is stopped and nothing looks
patchy or choppy then I'm going to go in
with veld and I'm going to apply this
with that little stubby end as a
Smashbox brush to my brow bone just to
give us a highlight and to lift up that
little bra all right there next I'm
going to go in with noir and I just
decided that it needed a little bit more
deepening up and I literally took the
smallest possible amount and I'm adding
it right on the outer corner of the eye
just doing teeny tiny swiping motions
nothing dramatic next I decided to go in
with a peony and I did wet this color
and I'm going to pack it on a synthetic
brush to get most of the color to show
up and I'm just going to put this on the
inner corner of my eye and a swiping
packing on motion we're not going to
blend out this part now I'm anyway with
my it cosmetics gel liner and I have
this little bitty gel liner brush from
Sigma it is the mom and it does such a
great job helping to create that great
winged liner umm my weakness and winged
liner is definitely working with gel
liner but I feel like it appreciate
pretty decent job here the liner to get
a little bit more dramatic than what I
thought it would but you know sometimes
our winged liner has a mind of its own
and just kind of see right here whoop oh
my god that is a big wing now we're
going to go in and conceal our face I'm
going to take the age rewind just to
cover the darkness and I'm just gonna
place this right in that inner corner
not bringing it out too far and next I'm
going to take this prep and prime print
pin and apply it on out and I'm also
going to run it down the nose keep it
still in forehead the reason I do this
is because this pin is so lightweight
it's not a concealer it is a highlight
pin so does not feel like you have like
that much makeup on your face when you
apply concealer all over your face you
get into super heavy makeup so then just
blending that out with my dampened
Beauty Blender of course now I'm going
to set it with this neck NYX CC setting
powder this is an awesome drugstore
setting powder I
only recommend it and always remember to
set your concealer that should be my
disclaimer on every video next going in
with java from the anastasia beverly
hills palette i'm just going to apply
this to the cheekbone area and circular
motions and this is just going to help
us create a little bit of structure to
our face a little definition not really
contouring warming up the skin and just
you know adding just a little bit of
dimension to the face not going too
crazy here and I love this brushes from
malli beauty and it comes you can get it
at Ulta but I think it comes in a kit
I'm not sure I get a lot of questions on
it now I am contouring the nose I'm
using this awesome fluffy I should have
brush to contour my nose and I'm just
using Java and just running a little bit
of it right down the two sides of my
nose and a little bit on the tip of my
nose next going in with this gorgeous
blush from makeup geek oh my gosh look
how crazy it shows up it's like so
pigmented but it's beautiful when it
brings out the purple in the eyes then
going in with this highlight from Mac
and this is an f-35 brush I'm Sigma I'm
just going to add that to the high
points of the cheeks down the nose and
Cupid's bow you can skip that part if
you don't like the shimmer now I'm going
to go in with that big color and I'm
going to blend that with a mid sweeper
brush from Sigma all over the lower lash
line bringing that from inner to outer
corner then I'm going to go in with that
temper darker purple color and bring it
a little bit closer and lastly I'm going
to get really close up in there and I'm
going to apply a little bit more temper
to that or be wet end next I'm going to
add a little bit of a lighter color to
my waterline I really like the way
that's just widen the eyes even more
using a light color next for lashes I'm
going to be adding a little bit of
Physicians Formula mascara not really
doing much for the lashes just adding a
small coat to help them blend in with
these bad-boy false lashes these are
dimepiece I only need
in the name of them is just amazing and
they're awesome me clashes now for lips
I couldn't decide what I wanted to do so
first I just started out with lining my
lips with cork which is an awesome lip
liner from Mac and then I was like
alright what are we gonna put on top
this so I went in with buttercup and it
looked really pretty but I was like eh
just a little bit too light but if you
guys like that you could stop here with
a pinkish color then I went in with
Rodeo Drive and added that on top and
just to deepen it up a little bit and I
was super happy with a lip color and
there's our final look thank you guys so
much for watching I love you guys more
than words could ever express your
amazing to me checked it out more from
my social media and I hope to see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
