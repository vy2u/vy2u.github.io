to my bedroom so today's video is going
to be a nighttime routine including a
get unready with me I'm going to show
you while I get ready for bedtime at
nighttime including skincare and I
partner with Clinique to bring you this
video I so pep star eye cream as well as
their take the day off balm which is a
makeup remover and I'll show you how I
use that including some other skincare
products also the day week um this one
it to the beach a little bit we live
kind of close to the beach and we do
enjoy doing that in the afternoon so we
thought we would take you with us to do
that hope you guys enjoy the video be
sure and subscribe before you leave ma
chick hope you guys are excited for the
video and yeah I'm gonna go take a nap
now and we're gonna get started welcome
to the Santa Monica Pier guys if you
haven't been here before today we were
gonna be chillin on the pier riding
bikes and eating sober giris this
afternoon so normally me and Tyler do
takeout where we get some fast food we
go out to eat so I'm taking you along
with us to do that next we're gonna be
riding some bikes if you follow me on
snapping them all about riding bikes
it's normally kind of crowded but we
went late in the afternoon as you can
see it's kind of desk the sun's going
down it's really beautiful and we're
just chilling
I like I'm drunk right in the bye guys
I'm swerving everywhere but we have a
really good time and I love it
next up I like to go frantically running
on the beach and running from drones
helicopters lasers things like that so
the first thing I like to do when I get
home is watch the beat off my face y'all
that cake is real and it's time to clean
your face and then you turn on the
lights look in the mirror and this is
what you look like all day ahh
so all of a sudden my hair and makeup
change I don't know how that happened I
was like magic is really cool how that
happened I had to film these in two
separate days guys that's what happened
okay just work with me here
does anyone else spend a lot of time
picking out their face or making weird
faces in the mirror I know I do
so the best feeling in the world is not
taking up your bra is actually taking
off your false lashes
what I like to do is dampen my face with
my hands and then to use the Clinique
take the day off this is my bread and
butter this will melt your makeup like
there is no tomorrow it will literally
break down the most cakey makeup in the
world it will take it off it just eases
the process of washing your face you
don't have to use makeup wipes these are
like a bomb makeup wipe they are amazing
and I just miss Shan Shan Shan my Shasha
intermarché can massage it all around
my lips it breaks up liquid lipstick
eyebrow pomade I even do the eyes like I
just rub it all over my face
and then I rinse it off it is the
easiest way to remove your makeup and
then I will clean the excess of my face
lightly I've been loving the tarts this
is their deep dive facial cleanser I
learned the hard way to only use like a
pea-sized amount of this because a
little goes a long way and then I rinse
my face and I pat dry and normally Pat
it dry that way hopefully I won't get
wrinkles one day I'll get wrinkles
either way anyways next I'm gonna be
using the Clinique prep start this is an
eye cream that instantly and overtime
brightens refreshes and awakens tired
looking eyes it has natural collagen it
helps diminish darkness under the eyes
which is good for everybody don't nobody
want no dark circles under they asked so
I've been really loving this area I can
definitely tell that it Brian's the
under eye area and I highly recommend it
to you guys especially because it's
lightweight I personally don't do heavy
cream moisturizers under my eyes because
it has the potential of creating Miglia
which is like really light little white
dots under your eyes and they're hard to
get rid of but this one's so lightweight
is almost like a gel moisturizer so I
don't have to worry about that and it
hydrates the under eye area which also
makes your makeup set on your face even
better
next for some serums I've been using the
Loreal youth code I used to use this
back in high school to preserve my skin
but now I'm going back to using it so I
really love this product I don't know if
it has very many anti-aging properties
because the texture Perfector is
supposed to be really good for your skin
for moisturizer for the longest time
I've been using the Tasha pore
perfecting gel moisturizer this is like
a water-based moisturizer so it won't
clog your pores and it does an amazing
job in moisturizing my skin I never have
dry patches or any more and have to deal
with that so here's a close-up of my
skin which that's like really close-up
Laura and then I take out my slobbery
Invisalign tray and I brush this hoodie
the youth I do I love brush my teeth I
love with my teeth feel nice soft and
slimy actually brush them because anyone
else is to brush attack them at night
then I pop the Invisalign trays in I'm
mostly doing this and my dentist won't
get mad at me and yeah then I light up
much candles around my house I'm gonna
set with bath and Bodyworks candles I
burned them 24/7 this one's from Urban
Outfitters I only bought because it
looks really cool whenever you lied it
was overpriced it's like $18.00 for like
a teeny tiny candle what are you
thinking urban outfitters and then i
cozy up on the couch typically i post on
instagram or work on video edits but i'm
not going to do this in this video
because that's just too cliche i'm gonna
watch some TV Netflix and chill with my
cats until I like to play with them with
a laser it's not a sniper gun it's on my
couch it's just a laser does anyone else
force love from their animals because I
know I do you just wait and it'll fight
you because you did do this thing in the
world
by the way this is Lou and this is Yoshi
we adopted them out of the shelter in LA
and they are the love of our life next
here is our bedroom we have 900 pillows
on the bed for no reason at all other
than just to look per day does anyone
else get pillow fights at night
and that's it next we watch shameless
obsessed with the show you gotta watch
it when that clicks it's super crazy
yeah girl Batum bait on with a bat I
love it obsess and then we go to bed I
love you guys thanks for watching and be
sure and subscribe before you leave off
see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
