hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be my I wanted to say
October but we all know it's November
8th video is going to be my November
favorites I won't be the one that says
oh my god you guys believe it's already
November where house is you're gone okay
I said it but I didn't want to one quick
announcement I am gonna be doing a vlog
mess this year on my blog channel which
is Laura Lee vlogs so if you want to
check that out it will start decent bird
the first which it has already started
because it should be December the 2nd
right now don't forget to show me a
little bit of love and get the paper
test thumbs up if you did enjoy mortgage
comes in Friday and get started
jumping right in you guys know we always
start with a favorite TV show and our
favorite song in the month so the
favorite TV show this month is by that
comes on e and I have just been so
addictive to everybody's stories however
I had like a fine line of enjoyment and
getting very annoyed with the show
because whenever you're putting
cosmetics before your personal health I
don't see that you are appreciating your
precious life and that gets annoying to
me on the show sometimes in the episodes
go like that like I'm out I can't deal
with this person nope then okay my
favorite song of the month well that's
easy it is everybody's favorite song
maybe not everybody but definitely mine
it is Adele hello how are you
that song has got me missing people that
I don't even know not like in some very
sad emotional state right now I'm like
I'm good and but when I listen to that
song I'm why is there somebody out there
that I really miss now talking about
beauty products the personal ones who
mentioned to you guys is the color icon
by wet-and-wild oops this is their
little eyeshadow palette I don't use
these little sponges anyways but I think
this is probably their prettiest
eyeshadow palette they have ever came
out with I saw it at Target and I had to
get it not to mention it's extremely
affordable and you get eight different
shades in it so I mean I don't think
it's the most pigmented I should have
palette in the world but I will show you
really quickly how I make it pigmented
I've been using the Too Faced glitter
glue
and then applying the eyeshadow on my
lid now they are really soft and creamy
to me they just aren't long-lasting
unless you put some hardcore
primer down like this they also have one
from elf cosmetics that is like a
glitter glue primer but it works really
well with making the eyeshadows stick
onto the lid now as far as blending it
out in the crease and all wouldn't I
recommend getting the glitter glue
around your crease because what I will
typically do is do all my crease colors
and then apply the glitter glue to the
lid and then the eye shadow of my choice
which mine has been this definer shade
at the bottom right here I'll do
close-up swatches beautiful next I
wanted to talk about my glossy box this
month I was super impressed with it and
I love glossy box I remember one time
back in the day I got my bossy boss in
and Alex and Andy bracelet came in it so
you never know what you're gonna get out
of a coffee box but that like I don't
know I will never forget that glossy box
was very impressive for the month of
December which you can still get this
box right here and they give me a
discount code for only the first 100
people to use it it's just laura-leigh
and you get 20% off so that is just for
the person 100 people again I'll put it
down below as well as a link to glossy
box if you're interested it's a $21 box
a month and since Christmas is knocking
on our door I feel like this would be a
really cute Christmas gift to get
somebody for my international viewers
out there the Box does sell to 10
different countries outside of the
United States so you know you can still
get your box and let me share with you
what is inside the first thing is a full
sized deluxe mascara glossy box comes
with deluxe or full sized stuff so
you're getting a really big bang for
your buck this is AMT g-m-e
I just made that up that's not what this
says that m TJ high definition mascara
it has a very unique like OOP one on it
and it is a rubber one like not like a
bristly wrong one if you I'm saying my
favorite things that comes in is the
simple sugars handmade all-natural body
scrub this one is in coconut and it
smells heavenly you get a lip gloss this
one is my gold label cosmetics and it is
a beautiful bright red color thing that
you'll get is color Club and it's
feverish ain't nail polish this is a
beautiful maroon color
lastly this is my favorite thing that
came in the box this is a actual glossy
box eyeshadow let's see I really like
the color of it it's like a deep brownie
plum it's almost like it's iridescent
where it's like brown but then you look
at it again then it's like whoa it's
plum eye shadow it's worth $11 mascara
alone is worth $21 the nail polish is
worth $8 the lipstick is worth $14 the
body scrub is worth $14 what am i talk
to you guys about are something you've
seen me wear all month long and I've
gotten so many questions on have I been
wearing them naturally Nicole nails or
Nicole Pereira smells that she came out
with with nur nail her and yes that's
exactly what I've been wearing I have
been linking them in the description of
my in the description of my description
box I love these little kitty cat claw
nails I feel like Nick Selleck Nicole is
such a cat lover like she gets me her
nails aren't fabulous I will let you
guys know my all-time favorites are the
naturally Nicole's I just got some new
sets because I'm in popping mine off all
around the house but two more that I
love is the flawless set and I've also
loved whisper so between flawless
whisper and actually Nicole
X product I have been adoring is the
NARS and Stephen Klein collaboration the
blush palette has actually been my
favorite product I'm I'm not gonna lie
I'm a little bit confused when it comes
with the eat it you can either brush and
it like wait what palette is poppin I'm
gonna be honest I don't use this shade
right here but these three shades have
been my lifeline and I cannot stop using
them because I love them
so freaking launch we are just gonna
have to talk about the packaging for one
second because how unique is this you
know it's kind of like freaky and crazy
looking at the same time I said you know
if you're looking at hundred blush
palette which one's gonna catch your eye
next product I have to talk to you guys
about like have to have to have to
because I've worn these for three days
straight and I've never had more people
ask me what's on my eyelids to say these
are the makeup geek duochrome pigments
so they have them in the eyeshadow form
and I feel like the pigments lasts a lot
longer
and they show up crazy intense they're
gorgeous I came home the other day he
was like whoa when I come over here your
eyeshadow is pink and when I go over
there is gold I was like it's called
duochrome
I just seriously think they're the best
I honestly think like if someone bought
these and put them as stocking stuffers
like it's like bought two and dropping
them down in the stocking how cute would
that be Tom Nia is my all-time favorite
one out of any of them and then a
hologram with me my second favorite one
I have to support a fellow youtuber Tati
I love that girl too that she is the
sweetest person he does the best reviews

truthful review of something go to Tati
Channel she came out with some lippies
and I show colors herself so these are
the love of color bike to3 matte
lipsticks and five one-and-done i shadow
six so if you're a girl on the go the
eyeshadow sticks are gonna be marvelous
for you this is one of them right here

shadow pencil and you can just color
it's so soft and creamy no lie so soft
and creamy so you just color on your lid
you could even Pat it out with your
finger and you are one and done baby
girl yes I love the texture of the lippy
pencils because these are matta and I'm
all about Matt
so they actually roll up like this so
it's kind of like a little lipstick tube
here great for popping into your purse
of all the eyeshadow ones is the on
point on point I feel like you need a
snap when you say that ah point is a
very pretty sparkly champagne color very
neutral I think will look gorgeous on
anybody's eyelid so again just color it
on your eyelids Pat it out with your
finger Hank they're gorgeous and I'm so
proud of Tati so congrats girl finally I
have found some extensions that match my
hair because my hair is like not quite
ombre is Omo it's still a little bit
ombre but it's like so such of a deeper
color it's a very soft ombre and I've
had a lot of trouble finding extensions
to match my hair and I have finally
found some so these are the extensions
these are the birch I don't even know
how to pronounce this girl's last name
mm-hmm I don't know her story but also
know it's her centrist Mac
my hair so actually these are just the
Bellamy hair extensions and I laid the
exact ones down below because it says on
the box that get us in here and I don't
have them with me but it comes with this
hangar I'll have these all over the
house normally I just put them together
so I could show you guys and out like I
have my life together um these are the
exact color of my hair like I'm just
thrilled I've been wearing them non-stop
if you look at my pictures on Instagram
I've gotten so many comments about my
hair and it's because it looks so full
and it's the extensions now I don't have
them in today obviously they're right
here in my hand but whenever I do my
hair just goes from like a 5 to a 10 I
start to talk about is the dr. Brandt
this is so random because dr. Brandt is
like a skin Caroline but they made a
facial primer and this is a pore refiner
primer so it helps blend out on smooth
out the pores if you have large pores I
do right through here lightly I don't
know I don't know why like why is that
happening to me pore refiner
I remember I had a sample of it and I
kept the sample forever because I love
it so much bad I don't know I didn't
rush to me that was dr. Brandt and you
could just like get it from like support
this amazing facial primer so I don't
you have to do is it blend it out on
your skin before you put on your
foundation or whatever makeup you're
gonna be wearing that day and it is
amazing for smoothing out unwanted areas
it's not a color correcting primer but
it's definitely there if you have like a
texture in your skin that you want
covered such as large pores acne scars
something like that this is probably
like the best one and it is mattifying
so it's for Olli skin got a lesbian girl
this my picture book I want to talk
about this Kaplan this bottle is so
gross it has a water droplets all over
it cuz I keep it in my bathroom like in
the shower it's got water leaking
everywhere all over me
it's the kaplan md cell renewal micro
exfoliant this is probably like the
teeny tiniest exfoliant ever meaning
like the most fine grain exfoliant ever
what i actually use this for is my chest
i noticed i took it like a picture on my
cell phone
notice like my chest look discolored and
I look down I mean it's like hard to see
your chest you know you're like my chest
was a little bit discolor like there's
some darker areas wider areas so I
started exfoliating my chest with this
stuff and it made a
world of difference like my chest is all
one color now I had to be really
consistent with it and that had a
moisturize my chest really well because
explants can be very dry but i did and i
like fix my chest right up so i think if
you had some discoloration on your face
as far as just darkness in certain areas
if you did an exfoliant often that
wasn't too harsh like this one right
here it could really fix you up because
it fix my problems that is all for my
monthly favourites i covered so much
stuff that i have been absolutely
adoring and i was really happy to do my
November favorites for you guys because
I've been wanting to talk about so much
great things I love you guys thank you
so much for being here and I hope to see
you Oh for those of you who stay to the
end of the video don't forget to enter
