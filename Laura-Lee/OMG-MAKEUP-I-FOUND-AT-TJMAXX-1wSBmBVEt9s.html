know I'm the star that supposed to be
yes saving money what's up party people
today's video is going to be a t.j.maxx
haul and it's gonna be surrounded by
makeup and I ran a lot a lot a lot of
good stuff I also went to a different
teacher marks than I did in my last
video I've done this video once before
and you guys really liked it and that's
why I'm filming it again
yeah I'm obsessed what you do marks in
HomeGoods and I went to a different one
this time to see if I could find
different branded stuff and that I did
indeed the HomeGoods live like I love
all the Halloween decor especially it's
my favorite time of year to go there and
get all the Halloween and Thanksgiving
and fall decor for home so then I went
upstairs and went to TJ Maxx as well
with that being said we're gonna go
ahead and jump into the video but
without further ado well sing a special
little song can it go something like
subscribe to patina bother ya Lee I was
all Yelly
and let's go ahead and drink
guys we're gonna go ahead and jump right
in I got so much stuff up I'm really
excited because this box I think I
bought an empty box the box feels empty
oh my gosh guys I think I did people
took them make it people took the makeup
out of the box and I literally just got
this and someone took out the foundation
in highlight what the hell and how did I
not notice that whenever the box was so
lightweight they had a lot of these
they're so far this isn't epic failure
great we'll have to go back to t.j.maxx
on that one next up I got something from
Marc Jacobs the package was kind of it
looked like it has seen better days so I
bought it anyways because I wanted to
check it out so I got a $20 blush know
of $20 eyeshadow for $12.99 so good
savings there it does come in the nice
Marc Jacobs pouch oh it even got okay
someone's watched it someone's watched
all the colors here the colors it has
grey black and a shimmery white color
but you can tell a fingerprint has been
in them say that is not cool but I'll go
ahead and show you some swatches ease
since someone swatch them I don't trust
using it on my eye just make sure you're
opening and checking the makeup that you
buy TJ Mac so you're not wasting your
money and I would also say if they won't
let you I wouldn't buy it so I got this
two-faced cat's eye compact and it was
$20 so I got it for $14.99 one color
husband swatched maybe with the rest
look perfect and they look really pretty
I've never used this palette I've never
gotten this palette before so I'm
excited to try it out those like it has
three shades for your brow bone a satin
and shimmer and a matte and then it
looks like it has six eyeshadow shades
so let's just watch a few of these has
anyone gotten this palette before they
do feel a wee bit dry I don't know how
old this eyeshadow palette is but the
colors look really pretty and they do
have a lot of
meant and then these are just the three
highlight shades for like your brow bone
are all over your lid here is this
palette it is missing the insert card
that normally comes in to face palettes
I guess that's okay we're gonna count
this as a win okay next from Estee
Lauder I really love their skin care
line especially their advanced Knight or
Baba they have so many pieces to that
line so I got the micro cleansing foam
I'm quite a sucker for cleansers I adore
them I love them I appreciate them I
like trying out new cleansers all the
time as well this is a 30-i cleanser for
$19.99 and it's supposed to be a really
creamy moussey cleanser this is what it
looks like and let's have a sniff whoo
it's sealed
see that's a good sign that's when you
know you're doing good business it just
smells super luxe nothing like smells
like you might spend a lot of money on
it that's what it sounds like okay I got
a lot of stuff from Kevin a Quan and I'm
really excited about that I've never
seen them at t.j.maxx before and I yeah
I'm just excited there's fingerprints
all over this do you see the product all
over it that is not good oh shoot
the pump is like the products been used
in it this is $33 I bought it for 19
bucks I'm gonna keep the box see what I
can do oh it looks so pretty it's like a
bronzing mousse I just imagine this all
over my body more so than my face the
celestial skin liquid lightening oh it
doesn't smell like anything great but it
looked really pretty abroad zeon the
skin so unfortunately it's been used so
I don't know if I should keep it you
guys are like no Laura next up I got a
Kevin a Kuan mascara never tried their
best Cara I haven't really gotten to
play with a lot of coming up on makeup
before so it's like not a newer brand
for me excite known about it for a lot
oh wow I just haven't tried out a lot of
their makeup so I'm excited to you now
this is a $25 mascara that I got for
$14.99 the mascara tube feels so luxe
and heavy and it is the essential
mascara look at that tube so far so good
hopefully this hasn't been used who a
lot comes off I don't know about you
guys but I like when a lot of mascara
comes off of my
I don't like whenever the little cleaner
offer inside the tube scrapes all the
mascara off so I think I might like this
mascara and it's a super black color so
I can't wait to try this now from butter
LONDON I got one of their moisture
lipsticks and I only paid five bucks for
this for these this is normally $8 this
is what it looks like in the black
little tube right here I opened it it
doesn't it has not been used that's
great
so another win oh very moisturizing it's
not a matte lipstick if you can see it
has a sheen to it but is a bright pink
color and it looks so pretty like very
even of application I guess something
else huh
why do I have to make everything in
jingle I don't know so I got this is a
powder foundation I got the shade medium
I'm normally a medium so I just grab
medium and pray for the best but this
one was originally $33 and I got it for
$19.99 Oh comes with a brush that's
still in the plastic kind of sort of so
that's a good sign then in this pretty
velvet casing comes the oh I don't
understand it has like I don't know if
you can tell what you can tell us menus
but that's like a massive use mark
across it and the colors wait way way
too light for me anyways this is just a
mess I once watched it to see if it was
their skin color I'm sure and it was not
so they put it back and left it there
for me to buy okay I thought another
laura geller three-piece set and the
products actually in the box that's a
good sign let's see here all three
pieces are in here oh it's all it's a
lip strip so it's a lip scrub such a
cute little tube and then it has two lip
holes one is candid apricot and one is
honey lavender these are interesting
very interesting apply generous to your
bare lips so let's open her up
the top of it just broke off literally
the top just broke off it's just it's
supposed to be glued on and
it's not oh my gosh this one's broken -
guys what is the T this is so janky what
I'm done with that I'm not doing this
I'm not okay and thank God this much
just a squeezy - because three four
three
Jesus soft why are we having so much
trouble let's open up something I know
is it busted I've got a Beautyblender
how awesome is that I mean obviously you
can never have enough makeup brushes and
beauty blenders in my opinion because
they get so dirty and sometimes you
don't have time to wash them so think
you're just like oh this one is a twenty
dollars and I got it for $14.99 it is
the original Beauty Blender and from
what I can tell it has not been used so
I just got a discount at Beauty Blender
in the shade purple how cool next I got
another skincare product this is the
pony wrinkle reducing cream which why
not right so this is by stroke vac tank
destroy Becton I like their skincare
they're normally found at Sephora this
was 27 I got it for 1699 I'm gonna save
10 bucks there oh and it is brand-new we
have a nighttime serum would you look at
that has not been used that's a good
deal I love good skincare as well I just
bought this this isn't like high-end or
well-known makeup by any means but I
bought this because I thought this will
be cute to put in a giveaway for you
guys so this is $12.99 it was originally
26 and it said it just so brush set and
the brushes look so soft and it came
with a sponge so I actually got this for
you guys and then I'm gonna do a big
giveaway soon but I also got this for
you guys and this I thought it was so
cute in the makeup bag was sixteen bucks
and I got it for $9.99 next I got
another Kevyn Aucoin product and this is
a eyes shadow duo and this was
originally $25 that I got for $14.99
it's in its nice little velvet compact
oh it has not been swatched there's a
little fallout which is probably because
it's been beaten up and oh do you see
this watches girl I see the swatches
almost got played why these are a little
bit powdery feeling and dry again but
they are pretty colors with a lot of
pigment just switch them on
I now will open everything now by at
t.j.maxx I know the last time I did the
haul like one or two products were but
nothing like this girl this is a mess
thanks I got from benefit Hyde and Sheen
so it's like a concealer and highlighter
in one
oh my god if you guys seen that video
going around I'm a saying concealer
wrong for a minute straight I live for
it and I pretty much watch it every
night before I go to bed I don't assess
this is thirteen dollars was and I got
it for $9.99 so I only saved three bucks
this is definitely an older package from
benefits is nothing I've seen before it
hasn't been used it repeat it has not
been used as super good feel super
creamy and good ooh that concealer well
there you go make another video
concealer concealer concealer Mountain
kidding you can see that concealer does
the leg it's super nice the highlight is
so-so but we're just gonna have to try
this out I got this really interesting
product let me know in the comment
section if you want me to try it out
this is the bungalow Beauty this is a
sponge and one side of its kind of
velvety on one side of it silicone which
I know these have been around but not
with a velvet side so I thought I would
try it and I got this for 399 it was
originally six dollars so four dollars
plunge it could be good next I got a
product that I tried before and I do
like this is the bare minerals it's
their translucent powder and they have a
glow side in a like luminous side so I
got this for 1999 it was 25 bucks so I
send me a big no five bucks girl you can
do some math in there huh like
inspecting everything that I get it like
so it's super white but this is the
matte and this is the glow I think yeah
this has not been messed with so um I
kind of hope it hasn't but anyways this
is really great for mattifying the skin
so I rub it in super translucent this
product is awesome and I do like it but
it will flush back on you aren't careful
last but certainly not least I got a
Kevin of one eye pencil for $9.99 that
was originally $17 hairs lose the pencil
is double ended so I got a bang for my
buck
oh it is not
and it one's a smudgy oh this is really
pretty it looks like it has been
swatched but I might oh my god this is
pretty makes me want to do a blue eye
look this is so pretty yeah this is
called defining Navy and that is it for
my t.j.maxx haul we had quite a few
because the products were squash or open
so like I said in the video I highly
recommend that you open and check those
products before you buy them don't get
played like I did okay and also um we
had a lot of hits and saved a lot of
money on makeup how awesome is that

t.j.maxx and I love you guys so much
