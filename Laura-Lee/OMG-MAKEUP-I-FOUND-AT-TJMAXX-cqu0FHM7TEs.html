today's video is going to be a different
today's video is going to be a much
different video I'm nerv filmed a
t.j.maxx home before but I thought it'd
be cool I was in teaching much just
looking around for a bunch of stuff that
I definitely don't need and I came
across the makeup section and I could
not believe the makeup I found at
t.j.maxx oMG I found really high-end
products now I don't know exactly how
discounted those products are or these
are so I'm going to kind of look up a
few oh my phone is doing its really that
discounted or is it just like kind of
the same price but in t.j.maxx I don't
know I personally love like TJ Maxx and
home goods I'll go in there with the
intent to buy nothing and come out with
a million things it's kind of like
Target I've shook how much like high-end
makeup I found in there again we'll
check the price to see if it was a
really a good deal but anyways also
almost forgot to tell you my he riches
that's not what I had to tell you I'm
doing a huge giveaway with three big
winners three big winners no three
winners of lots of makeup and all you
have to do is he subscribe to my channel
and I'll have the end date in the
description box down below because I
can't remember the end date off the top
of my head so without further ado go
ahead and throw this material and we'll
go ahead and jump right into the video
here is my back at all so much phone oh
well that's why it's heavy I bought this
mirror because my mirrors are all really
tall and whenever I set them down it's
right in front of the camera so I
figured I would get a small mirror
Feakins Sienese crap you can still see
it but a bigger can help me do my
tutorials and look down that way the
mirror wasn't blocking so much or wasn't
facing this way so that's why I bought
this mirror and it was not ninety nine
so that was a good deal not part of the
makeup haul video but what to start with
let's start with this cool little Bobby
Station set I'm just going to set the
bag right down there my family is in
town right now and I'm so excited so I
took a little break real quick from them
and from this video and I'm going to be
right back to family time they actually
leave tomorrow so I've got to see
instance pinion beans spend the whole
week with them and it's been such a
great time such great time first thing I
found I something by Bobby Brown and
this was $24.99 now I'm pretty sure this
is a good deal because you get a mascara
a brush and I liner in a cream eyeshadow
they're selling this online for 43:55
and I got for $24.99 so yeah this was a
good deal
I'm just getting skeptical because I
don't know why the prices just seemed a
little high take a peek at what I got
gel liner eye caviar number 27 I got the
brush and the metallic cream eye shadow
Brown metal number four and i swatched
it with a brush and it's very sparse and
glittery so I'm not that in love with it
but I think it could be really pretty
packed on with your finger instead of
the brush here is the smoldering eyes
mascara that I got and looks like a
pretty simple one but I do I do like
ones that look like this
so we'll see I will say that that was a
pretty good deal I'm excited about the
Bobbi Brown's kit okay next I got an
interesting set from Mac Mac look in a
box it's a face kit I got this base ship
for $39.99 so 40 bucks and let's see
what all is inside it looks like they
still sell this at Nordstrom's for $56
in 50 cent I got it for 39 we saved some
dollars oh that's so nice look at this
for 39 bucks
we got a lip glass a lipstick a brush
the liner was hiding in the box
two eyeshadows and a blush I think
that's a really good deal especially
because the blush shade is mocha and
this is one of the best Mac blush shades
that's in the kit
I got carbon and pearled earth these are
the eye shadows that came in it and
carbon is just a must-have black from
Mac and then pearled earth is like a
granite pretty shimmery color lipstick I
got is /out fabulous and I got the lip
glass in dancing soul and then I just
went ahead and watched these for you
guys to have a little look-see Pooh I
also got this all matte
blush brush which it actually feels kind
of rough just like the brushes I love so
I can't wait to use this okay you have
to tell me do you guys like shop at
t.j.maxx like the one in Alabama that I
used to go to nah I've been to it like
four years so I don't know if this
statement still stands but like I could
I rarely found like NARS stuff there I
would find a couple bareMinerals NYX I
think lots of elf makeup but nothing
like to to major like Mac and Bobby
Brown I never found there so it's really
excited about finding those things and
the skincare wasn't that great there and
I found some cool skincare from here
what about you guys in your local area
like what you find
okay next up I got for $5.99 now I know
that that's a good deal I believe these
are almost 20 bucks I'm not going to
swatch it because I'm actually just
going to put this in a giveaway and give
this to somebody I already have it I
just want to show you guys it was at the
t.j.maxx yeah these are $21 and I think
the Mac mineralized lipsticks are 20
bucks and I got it for 20 bucks so this
was not a good deal no t.j.maxx you got
me okay oh this is a pretty shade yes
glad yes this shade is called a rare
breed now this is a nicer formula it's
the mineral rich lipstick it's not the
average MAC lipstick and then this is
the shade very pretty but I did pray
pretty much full price for it - that
sucks
you win some you lose some but you live
to fight another day
next I got a Bobby Brown lip palette
more Bobby Brown this palette I got for
$29.99 and it runs around 44 - 45 bucks
we definitely got a good deal on here
this is a genius palette for makeup
artist if your makeup artist and you
need things for your kit you can always
check out TJ Maxx and try to get you
some deal although most makeup artists
get the mag discount anyways but if you
don't it's a good way to get some stuff
for your kit next I got this Smashbox
blush trio which I already have this
Mike Fox sent this to move for and I got
it for $19.99 and it's normally $35 so
this was a good
little dealio since I already have it
I'm not going to swatch it put finger
prints on it great in hopes that I can
just give it to y-you guys to use I got
something from Kat Von D called
lightning liner I've never really played
with Kat Von D makeup before post is the
name of this one only $16 I got for
$7.99 let's boy I got a gross color yeah
this is not good look it's like look at
this liner she's sad I mean she may have
been tampered with and t.j.maxx it for
being real but she has seen many better
days that didn't work out moving on
compared at 99 I got compared I'm sorry
I got 499 mm Laura I got for $9.99 and
it's only $15 oh it opens like this this
is a bear up mineral the top shelf it
looks like it is two eyeshadows oh
they're pretty so pretty okay
these little things we normally throw on
this channel but I'm going to say this -
for Christine was simply no logical and
um one day I will give them all to her
because I know she will appreciate that
you feel so creamy oh okay very creamy
this palette is so just darling oh my
gosh dropped it well that was the deal
$9.99 for two little eyeshadows still
kind of pricey but their minerals is a
high-end brand so it's better than the
$15 they want it for it am I right
people next up I got the glowing skin
mom from the Estee edit and this one is
originally 36 I got for $19.99 this one
is in shade 300 wheat who I've actually
tried this for and it's pretty nice if
you like a lot of luminosity if you like
light weight if you like things that are
full coverage and matte you will hate
this if you like the opposite of that
you will love this but I got it for
$19.99 instead of 36 so that is a pretty
good deal oh boy she bought another Kat
Von D liner actually bought this stuff
like
a little while ago maybe a week ago so I
don't remember exactly everything in the
bag but this is originally 16 got it for
$7.99 hope this one's in hide okay and
broke and the brush is like stuck in the
lid so this is the biggest epic fail
that I've ever seen on this channel okay
great
as far as skincare I got a really cool
map this is the oxygen facial mask flash
recovery from dr. Brandt actually have
this mask and try it out before and it's
very cool it's actually kind of popular
because the foaming mask and I'm gonna
show ya oh yeah this is the foaming mat
I thought was I literally thought I was
wrong for a second I was like oh my god
I'm such an idiot but now it's the
foaming mask look at it they're cool and
the neato I'm just going to watch it
we're just going to watch it together
should I touch it with touch it so this
mask is good for recovery hydration
radiance and revitalizes it's just a
great little skin prep mask I got it
from 48 dollars I got it for $24.99 that
was a good deal for sure and I saw the
mask and recognized it and I was like
yes next up I got Beauty balance balm
moisturizer by dr. jart it has SPF 30 in
it and moisturizing resilient BB let's
see what is about so this was originally
at 30 bucks I got it for 19 bucks we
shave 10 I mean I got for 20 bucks I'm
sorry oh yeah we say 10 bucks on it oh
it's a BB cream I thought it was a
moisturizer great now I don't know even
know what shade I bought okay we're
going to open her up
look at that it's like know how I feel
about puppies do it all in my claw what
in the tarnation it is so full coverage
it's so full coverage filling and stay
however it feels like it's going to be
way too light for me I was not aware I
thought I was buying like a moisturizer
but it's a compact so we'll donate that
at least I save $10 on it next up we got
from Estee Lauder this is the chaplet
exclusive double wear mascara and little
black primer originally $47 I got this
for $24.99 kind of pricey for two
mascaras but let's get some sisters wham
bam thank you ma'am this is it so first
let's open up Oh black all right these
are full-size so maybe this is like a
good deal lengthening mascara zero
smudge and I don't hate the one on it
it's really long this one is the little
black primer so you're actually supposed
to apply this one first and then the
linking one I'm going to try these out
together I like that the primer is not
white and that it's a black which makes
way more sense to me than all these
white primers for your eyes can't wait
to try this out yeah got a little deal
next up I just picked up this brush from
Ecotools it was 399 so $4 is regular 5
so I saved $1 on it not huge savings but
I like Ecotools brushes a lot I think
they're really great drugstore brushes
come on come on come on oh yeah she's
super soft this would be a really soft
foundation brush or concealer brush so I
nabbed it up I thought it would be good
I got this for color palette by Clarins
which is normally $43 for $19.99 mm-hmm
we know where that's going we're going
to stop there although it looks super
luxurious and it came with this little
extra velvety piece like high-end makeup
does but let's swatch these eyeshadows
felt not super high pigmented but they
actually felt really creamy at the same
time so I think it's just like not so
much high shine more satin than shimmery
but very pretty by the way a lot of it I
said it was there but I do know they are
ending the line as the Edit
water is taking it off the shelf so that
is no longer going to be a makeup line
so I'm sure TJ Maxx is going to be
getting a lot of this stuff this is a
lipstick that was $12.99 that's
originally 22 bucks and let's watch her
oh it looks like a baby chewed on this
lipstick and then they sold it to me
I lost again next from Elizabeth Arden I
got a what is this I don't know about a
lash extending treatment mascara for
$9.99 that is originally 18 whoppin
allas so let's see what it's all about
so here it is this have lash treatment
within it this fancy gold tube well and
last but not least so sadly I got
another Kat Von D brow product and the
liners were like horrible fail so let's
see oh the brow product is not bad not
bad at all okay we got a brow pen I'm
not going to use it because it seems
like all the other see how I'm leaking
down there the base a little bit and it
seems like they had all been tampered
with
but it still has a lot of ink in it so I
still got it it's obviously been open
and played with unfortunately we're a
little pricey
oh I got it for $5.99 and it was
originally $12 I don't think they sell
this anymore because I haven't seen that
brow product so it's probably just like
a discontinued product which is all what
a lot of TJ Maxx gifts is discontinued
products so that is it for my haul video
guys oh my gosh that was a big T DX
hallways I think unfortunately we have
some messes we had some used products we
had some products that babies chewed on
and then we have some really good deals
we're going to max at some Bobby Brown
sets of clarence some dr. Brandt so many
good pieces let me know down in the
comments if you liked this video that
you want to see more of these type of
videos be hunting around for good deals
and like seeing what I find at
department stores or I don't know stuff
like that I think it could be like a
really cool little series on my channel
I love you guys think
so much for being here and watching
don't forget subscribe to my channel
because you know the one I give away and
you do not I love you guys and I'll see
you all in the next video okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
