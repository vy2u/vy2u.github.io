today's video is going to be me testing
out overhyped makeup meaning just makeup
that's talked about so much and you so
much you're like is it really good why
is it talked about so much I want to
know the tea on it so I just found a
couple products that are talked about a
lot Kim kardashian-west huda beauty
iconic London like these are some of the
products that you just hear over and
over and especially on Instagram like
you see them used so much so much with
that being said I figured I would do a
dedicated video and test out some of the
most hyped up products at the moment and
I'll tell you guys the tea and link on
my honest review of them I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and we're gonna go
ahead and jump in I really I really Oh
one announcement Caspar Jamis is gonna
be on beautybay on December the 6th so
just letting you guys know if you're
international you want Casa pajamas and
don't want to pay that high shipping fee
check out beauty by December the 6th
that will have the palette in stock
there beside that I'm gonna sing the
subscribe salt and we're gonna jump into
the video let's go ahead and jump right
into the meat
okay to get started I think I'm gonna
start with some base makeup so I'm
excited about this new concealer it's
the all-nighter concealer it's a
waterproofing this is a concealer from
urban decay and I've actually already
used it
I couldn't resist because I actually
adore the foundation that's in this
which doesn't always mean the concealer
is great and I'm gonna go ahead and show
you guys my thoughts by the way the
color I'm using today is medium light
neutral and I think it's the perfect
shade the consistency is very similar to
the foundation it's just very thick
really a lot of coverage this is my
second video I filmed today and the
first one I film was testing out fake
makeup and if you can see right here
these little bumps and right here
I'm whelping up right there I'm wiping
out the makeup I wash my face but the
makeup whatever was in the makeup is
making me well pup so I'm sure it was
full of that chemicals great but anyways
back to the concealer it's super full
coverage but I feel like if you have dry
under eyes because it's just so light
and adheres to your skin so well that I
feel like it was just like cooling to
those dry skin or like there's baggy
like the wrinkles in the under eye if
you're not careful I do like the
concealer though you're just gonna
moisturize a lot before you use it and
I've seen it talked about a lot very
hyped up the all nighter foundation was
very hyped up as well all things
everybody Kay comes out with its hyped
up Urban Decay has a lot of good
products so rightfully so but you know
I'm here to crack the code for ya
because I haven't spoke on this
concealer at all like to you guys and I
know I get a lot of questions on their
stuff but if you can see like it's so
full coverage and I really like that
about it so I'm except the concealer
real quick I'm just going to use I'm
actually gonna use this little
highlighter brush to set it today why am
i doing this I don't know
okay I applied a little setting powder
and next product I might be testing out
is the iconic London this is like a
super super hyped up Instagram brand
altogether I think every product they
come out with you see it all over
Instagram they do have a lot of good
products like I've been skeptical with
their products and then I testamento end
up liking them so I see why you see
everywhere
I haven't cream contoured in forever on
my channel so these are like okay here's
the tea they said they're just pigment
stick so honestly I think you can use
the math contour concealer foundation
whatever you want so um this one is in
3.0 and I think this is gonna be my
right shake it so I'm gonna cream
contour with it they're pigment sticks
and like--see holy crap this lumping man
I think I put too much great I haven't
used these before these this is like a
new a newbie to me a little bit on the
nails I'm gonna take a whiten brush it's
like this mini kabuki and I'm gonna
blend this out mm-hmm she put way too
much product they are a pigmented
pigment stick but like that wound it out
nice I just think I put a little too
much of my chi-chi's so when are we
winning this down to my elbows oh but
it's pretty this is a nice color that's
really pretty actually
it's like blending out pretty nice I
like it I'm just gonna know how to use
it that's the beauty and first
impressions you just make all your
mistakes the first time on camera all
right let's do the nosy posy sometimes
the finger does wonders as well I think
that product is really nice it blended
out so well I think it's super pigmented
so you got to be a little careful with
it and I also think that this color
worked out very well for me so I'm happy
yes Mike yes ma'am I'm actually gonna
add a little bit of this setting color
okay now we're gonna work on a highlight
so for highlight this is the winter
highlight palette which I haven't tried
out yet on my pad on my palette Lord and
mercy my channel beauty and the colors
are not typically colors I would go for
so I'm really interested to see how this
is gonna try out we have Arctic glow
winter rose Northern Lights and frosted
kiss here's swatches of all of them so
you guys can kind of get an idea of how
these look they all look really like to
be honest and like my skin tone is a
little bit dark and whenever I put such
a light highly on my dark skin tone
whenever I look directly at you it looks
like Ray's on my treat cheek it looks
really pretty from the side like
straight on it just turned so gray and I
hate it
I honestly think like winter rose the
pink one is gonna work best on me let's
see
obviously everything huda beauty does is
super hyped up and again she's come out
with a lot of good stuff so like I
understand why I'm just here to crack
the code I also don't have a makeup
wipes online all right so I'm gonna take
winter rose this is an hour 36 highlight
brush the one I use this isn't the one I
use for powder but it's the same brush I
just have two of them cuz I like them a
lot so here I go I just swallowed my
brush around
oh my god it's kind of interesting it's
like qac that's like a pink highlight I
don't know if I like it let's try
Northern Lights on the other cheek
actually more than lights is prettier on
me like it's prettier just I think
whenever you get into weird high light
colors like um it becomes creative
makeup and that's so beautiful and I
love that but um you know it's just like
I don't want to look see I don't know if
it has like with that little bit of a
grey hue on me I just had to be so
careful with highlights do any of you
guys experience that too who have like a
medium to deep skin tone like you just
can't get into lighter stuff because
whenever you're looking straight at the
camera
or straight out someone in real life it
just looks a little crazy so I mean it
just depends on your skin tone the
actual quality of the product I think is
really nice I just definitely won't be
able to wear all the colors let's move
on shall we
okay I know you guys want to hear the
tea on this this is the new Kate Kate
nuit
this is her lippies with their like
glitter lip gloss and then she also came
out with dust pigments and they're
supposed to be really sparkly and
beautiful so let's start with trying out
the pigments and this cool shade right
here is called rose gold and it's like a
pink with an arid s and gold reflective
in it I love the containers I think
they're so cute I really haven't seen a
container on the market that looks like
this I'm like Oh see you so I'm actually
just gonna it's like a little salt
shaker no salt and pepper
you guys must think I'm crazy so I got
some on my brush this is an important
one brush I'm gonna mist it with a
little fixed flush because any pigment I
never used my life I missed it you can
mist it with water as well you don't
have to pay the $21 for the fix plus I
personally love fix plus it's an
overhyped oh can I see how pretty that
is
oh it pigments are always a little crazy
to work with just because it's literally
a loose powder flying everywhere
um the wedding it helps and also like
cheese Louisa's is pretty if you go to
an event tonight so here's my make up
for it
holy dusty everywhere but I mean that
just comes with the territory of a
pigment I think it's really pretty
so let me go ahead and do the other eye
and then I'll swatch the other colors
and just show you what they look like
this color is actually kind of subtle so
let me try out I just poured out the
bronze everywhere here is bronze it's
really pretty there like pigments but
they have like a glitter in them as well
here is copper has like a reddish tint
to it this is yellow gold it's literally
a yellow gold I don't know how else to
explain it and the arid essence shade is
literally just called iridescent
actually gonna pop a little bit of peach
in my outer corner cuz cuz my eye needs
something it needs something to happen
here okay next we have these little
glossy wah C's so I'm gonna be trying
them out um okay I think I'm gonna try
out first bronze
so the glosses actually match the eye
colors I mean these are all kind of live
topper II and I feel like they all look
kind of similar like this is bronze this
is rose gold maybe just a little less
sparkle in them they're very very very
similar copper and less like honestly
like just my opinion unless this is just
a collector's item which a lot of makeup
is collector's item unless this
collector's item to you I see no reason
why to buy all these because I really
don't think you're gonna be able to tell
difference we have yellow gold
an era doesn't actually you can tell a
little bit of a difference like it looks
kind of cool
you can tell it's iridescent so I would
say this one is the one you can tell the
difference with the other four I think
looks super similar alright next product
is this Pat McGrath liner I think all
Pat McGrath products get really high I
think we all get really excited about
them I definitely do and I definitely
have talked about him a lot on my
channel as well as like so many people
if you type in her name like it's talked
about so much so this is a liner that
came in her kit in it is the
double-ended black liner marker one is
as sharp and pointy in the other end
literally looks like a marker so I'm
gonna try it out and see my thoughts
haven't tried this product before who I
will omit my strong point is more so
with a brush not a felt tip liner but
I'm gonna try out anyways do not hook on
your eye like I took out my eye I hate
how much I talk on my eye and i watch it
after I do it that's like Laura wrinkles
baby wrinkles
oh I'm literally struggling I made that
wing so big I mean if you guys are okay
with me being Catwoman today I'm just
gonna be Catwoman today that's a big
sweet like it's so black and like you
don't have to go over it too many times
because of how much product comes out
but girl this felt tips a little
difficult no okay I did the best I could
like I don't think that this is my best
winged liner and again that's cuz that
felt up honey but the actual product
with the liner does not dry shiny really
and you guys know I'm like a stickler
I'm like an anti shiny eye liner so I
like the way it dry okay I'm gonna pop
on some mascara and lashes and then
we're gonna move on to some other
products okay guys and lastly I just
want to talk about one more product
because they're so so so so high it's
the Stila now these are different than
the Magnificent want more magnificent
metal magnificent metals
the name oh these are a little bit
different than those this is the shimmer
and glow this is their new one that's
been talked about a lot and I know I
already have my eye shadow on from
testing out a pigment already but I
still wanted to tell you guys like the
tea on them because I know it's a super
overhyped product um these are actually
amazing I wore these all in New York the
whole entire time they didn't crack that
increase they didn't chip they lasted so
long they're just as good if not better
than the glitters like this is a genius
product and like just honestly I was
obsessed and I'm gonna continue to wear
them and I know they're talked about so
much I figured I'd just bring it up and
like let you guys know the tea tea on it
but yes it has about a good a product
and I had a random lebih just because
like I don't know I just felt like these
are just like such a little clear gloss
not a little bit more rose gold why not
right looks good alright guys so that is
it for this video honestly only the lip
glosses I think they all look the same
and then the highlighter palette like
just from my skin tone you gotta become
who your skin tone their hit and miss
but than that I did like a lot of the
products I hope this video was helpful
with over hi products and me test him
out and give it my honest review on them
um I love you guys thank you so much for
being here watching be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
and I will see you all in my next video

teeth
