video is going to be my October beauty
favorites and I actually have so much
stuff to talk to you guys about this
month I didn't think that I would
because I was like oh did all halloween
tutorial what am I gonna mention to my
favorites like googly eyes and like
spirit gum but no actually I had like a
lot of makeup products that I just fell
in love with having totally obsessed
with and I cannot wait to let you know
about them and I'm wearing this jacket
right now trying to be all cute but
reality is I am sweating balls
underneath it I'm gonna commit myself to
wearing the jacket though hey jump right
in and we're gonna get started and I
hope you enjoy the video you guys know
we always start in the favorites video
with my favorite song of the month three
favorite songs this month I mean
seriously
artists are coming out with good stuff
left and right and I am falling in love
first of all we talked about Justin
Bieber's sorry Oh such a good beat that
song is so good if you don't like Justin
Bieber you will like that song and I
will listen to that song and repeat
until I hate it the next song the event
seriously obsessed work I put it in my
phone is here by alessandra Cara I
believe that's how you pronounce it and
the song is here and it's like I'm sorry
that I will never sing that again just
such a good song and it's just about her
being at a party and she don't want to
be there no more okay lastly the other
song is the chainsmokers and the song is
called roses I believe that's right but
it's just such a good song like that
kind of music is my type of music I'm
such kind of strange a music listener
too don't know if that makes any sense
but I like weird music sometimes and I
love that song
listen to it played on Pete fall in love
with it yes favorite TV show okay again
I have two Walking Dead the next season
came out I it's moving a little slow for
me this season what are we on season
like 18 now but it's moving a little bit
slow I'm liking it but we need to speed
things up I need some things to happen
and Glen died so uh yeah kind of
mourning about that still you watch
Vampire Diaries they had a spinoff which
was the original
which was the original and actually I
think the originals is better than
Vampire Diaries they know I said it
Billy Zoo and spin-offs are like never
better but the originals I think are way
better than the Empowered re so yeah I
think right along let's talk about some
beauty products I wanna talk to you guys
about these flower elixirs that I've
just been trying out and I really do
like them so they're a little bit
different than our like a Roma therapy
they're just like an elector made from
flowers the Creator rooms been working
with them for over 15 years and it's
supposed to help you sleep better to
bring out the most positive and your
attitude just hope to bring out the best
and use a total of six of them and I can
go ahead and tell you that the inner
peach anointing oil is my favorite one
which is the one in the little blue
paper basically they are elixirs infused
with flour to ship your state of mind
and change the way you think about nine
different ones to choose from I will
have everything linked down below as
well as a coupon code but I do love
these and I do recommend these to you
guys if you're into the flower elixir so
they're super interesting and by the way
they are rollerball so they come on
little balls to roll on your skin it's
just a super neat little elixir that I
definitely wanted to mention to you guys
some the agenda to talk about is the
makeup forever primer so I have to
settle up not just one so I like to make
things complicated and it's the step one
skin equalizer so the first one is the
nourishing primer and then the smoothing
primer so the smoothing one I like to
use for the poor areas just honestly
right through here might be a little bit
right here in the gold bella
area and then the smooth are the
nourishing one I like to use where my
face is dry this seriously makes your
face so smooth and it really does
nourish your face pull that draw skin
but these two together are awesome I
mean if you're only dealing with one
issue I recommend only getting one I
mean this whole table behind me is about
to go X I want to talk about this oil
free makeup eye remover from Neutrogena
you guys actually recommended this to me
and I picked it up at Ulta in to fit or
mention it also whole long back and you
were right I love it I seriously love it
so much and I had swatch liquid
lipsticks all over my body basically
because I'm we're gonna do stuff like
that in my free time and I could not get
them off of me
seriously this stuff just like what lift
it right off actually want to talk about
some stuff from Sigma they're coming out
with awesome stuff a left and Ryan
somehow they're coming out with like new
collections like wildfire but I wanted
to mention a few a few of my favorite
pieces from the collection so they came
out with this Sigma pink collection it's
like this huge collection with all pink
products and by pink I mean packed I
used actually in a homing tutorial
already so you're probably familiar with
it but it is so pink so if you're a girl
of color or just love color you're gonna
love this in the packaging it's just
gorgeous has like this iridescent on it
and then I love the lipstick so this is
the Sigma pink power stick it's such a
nice a tube but anyways it's like this
hot hot hot hot Barbie pink lipstick and
it's so pretty and now my favorite blush
all-time gloves from Sigma is this one
the packaging again it's just everything
is called core Teresa Aurora brush and
it adds like this moppy peach color it's
kind of an original color I don't know
and it looks matte but once you get it
on your cheek is so much hack it has a
tiny bit of Sheen to it it's super super
pretty on super flattering love this
blush I'm all about it we haven't talked
about some new stuff from makeup geek or
murdered they came out with the things
are called oil finish Doyle Doyle rolls
what movie is that problem if I was the
dual finish I don't think I'm saying
that right and these awesome I shadowed
let's see of course it doesn't say it on
here I want to talk about my favorite
ones they have like an iridescent glow
and they look so normal it's like
regular eye shadow colors but they are
not they have like this era descent like
finish on them I don't know why I'm
doing this move my favorite is maje Tati
maja see probably saying that wrong - it
is so brainy oh my goodness I'm gonna do
as a twirl with these I promise but I
have three favorites the next one is for
my people that like color this one is
Secret Garden oh it's so gorgeous
okay it's like it's like it's hard to
describe because it doesn't exactly come
off this bright it looks like a deeper
purple like this tear till iridescent
glow over it intense and it's gone just
actually there's four
I love them we have to talk about
typhoon really quick I'm all about green
especially this fall I have been all
about wearing green eye shadow and so
this one it looks just like a plain
shimmery green eye shadow but then you
look at it again and you're like hold up
is that like the tulle or is it green
like what are you wearing because it's
like two colors and one and it's magical
and I love it it's one of their most
most neutral ones this one is I'm peach
las' it's so pretty this one reminds me
of some gorgeous bridal makeup right
here it's like a white shimmery
eyeshadow with a peach iridescent and it
is flawless
these are super creative different
eyeshadows I love them all I think
they're awesome and I think they're only
like six bucks apiece if I remember
correctly random I actually have despise
Mac Studio Fix foundation for a long
time because I remember the last time I
wore it I would for a long shift when I
was a medical assistant and I came home
and I looked wet I look so disgusting
and I honestly was pissed I was like Oh
screw you back oh but the other day I
was in Mac and I'm like okay I'm gonna
try it again I'm gonna give it another
try I don't know why I'm gonna get rid
of other choice there's a lot of
foundations that I love but I want it to
and I did and I love it again a wood
what happened
and I've worn it for like really long
periods of times because I'll normally
do my makeup around 10 a.m. and wear it
so like 12 o'clock in the morning so I
mean that's pretty long test run with
makeup and it looks good but I think I'm
just setting it with powders and wearing
primers underneath it and it's helping
it out and make it more for a flawless
finish in a longer lasting foundation so
with that I love it again and I am in
c35 for those of you wondering - how she
came out with oh you know what else I
have to mention to you and I don't have
it over here
honest how she came out with her new
glosses and I have two shades that I
cannot put down I did a full blog post
on them if you want swatches of all the
shades I will hook you up girl but as
far as the ones that I love is Kristin
and butterscotch butterscotch it's like
the best nude and then Kristen is just
an awesome like pink color to put on top
of everything anything and everything
I've been topping everything with it I
mean going crazy with it the self-made
palette is on associates new palette and
it actually has actually is more
eyeshadows
our regular pallets in it so I think
it's 35 I have seriously used this
palette like every single day um I'm
obsessed with this frickin palette right
here it is absolutely stunning the
colors are crazy creamy it does come on
come with a double and brush that works
really well every day I'm like okay
we're not gonna use that palette and we
are gonna move on and then there I am
grabbing it and using it my favorite
color in the palette is pink champagne
and of course I have it on my eyes today
let's talk about some tanner I actually
went to beauty comedy de la Prada which
is a company with skincare and they're
all about the luxury tan so they
actually give me a discount code for you
guys after I got back from beautycon so
I'll put that in the description box but
I fell in love with their products that
I got to use there and I really got to
talk to the people at the company like
about their products and learn like
educate myself on them a little bit more
this is the self tanning gradual lotion
so it's actually not like a self-tanner
it's like just a moisturizer you can use
every night and it will gradually tan
your skin and give you that nice bronzy
glow feel a broad ax is all about the
bronzy glow rather than the orange glow
which I'm all about and I actually got
my first spray tan ever with them in the
hotel room in New York and it was
awesome and I wish I could do it every
day so if you guys want to set up shop
in my house feel free to okay hair gets
crazier as the video goes on we have to
talk about a new product from pure and
pure as a brand that I'm just kind of
getting into trying out and testing out
their products but these are called
their eye polishes and I was laying in
bed one night and the FedEx guy came to
my house at like 8 o'clock at night I'm
like its key yes me that's weird these
came in so I was laying in bed playing
with them and I fell in love with them I
actually just did it towards two toriel
with the one in velvet so their eye
polishes you can use them alone on your
lid you can use them on top of your
eyeshadow or you can use them underneath
your eyeshadow you can use them
highbreed
I did a cranberry tutorial if you want
to check it out it'll be down below
my two favorite are velvet which is
actually the one that I use like in the
cranberry tutorial underneath my
eyeshadow and then I love satin as well
it's a super neutral champagne color or
I also want to talk about an exfoliator
that I love so much I hope it is in
stock if it's not in stuff and
cut it down the video but if this is
stuck I'll mention to you cuz it's
always sold out but is the natural
dermis exfoliant they have like a full
skin care of mine but my favorite out of
the skincare line is the exfoliant is so
so good it's all organic all natural so
you don't worry about it putting weird
chemicals on your face is a mint
exfoliating face polish and it's awesome
they give me a discount code on listed
down below if you like exfoliant you
will love that one
lastly I wanted to mention these skin
fix um ok skin fix is a newer Brent at
Target and I had seen them and a beauty
bag before but I didn't really get to
know about him until I went to an event
to get this haunt to them and learn
about the brand a little bit more so
they came out with this product called
eczema balm they have like a full liner
product but I wanted to talk to you guys
about eczema bomb but says their
products are 100% organic and natural
and if you're dealing with eczema which
I worked a dermatologist and so many
people deal with eczema and you know you
can put all kinds of different
treatments and chemicals and steroids on
your skin to help reduce it but this is
a really natural super super effective
way to deal with it again it's all at
Target so you can just pick it up there
but it's called the eczema balm it is
super super thick it was created like a
woman was making it in her I believe the
story's right was making it like in her
garage and selling it on the side of
pharmacist and finally they turned it
into a brand and got put in good
packaging and Target picked it up so
it's a really cool story behind it but
it's been extremely effective just like
a homemade remedy for eggs man I
recommend trying it out if you are
dealing with that that is it for this
monthly favorites I hope you guys
