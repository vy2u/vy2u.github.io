us revamping my vanity it is a little
bit crowded and overwhelmed and I'm
quite frankly I'm tired of it because I
can't really get to anything and I got
the new beauty box what so I am very
excited about that and I cannot wait to
fill it up so menu we're gonna fill up
my new beauty box together so if you're
interested in revamping my vanity well
then please just keep watching okay guys
so this is my makeup vanity and this is
what it looks like
most the time because I'm a super super
busy beauty blogger and I film videos
all the time and it's such a mess so
you're gonna help me clean this mess up
and get it organized yay now we are all
tidied up thank the Lord and I have this
new gorgeous beauty box right here which
is the original beauty box and the
website name is original beauty box calm
I will have the link for it down below
as well as a discount code for it for
you guys so we're going to be filling
this up today and we're gonna be kind of
taking the products out of these two
pieces and putting it into this bigger
one just cut this in the mail and
honestly I seriously squealed when it
came in it is so big and lovely and it
just slides out so sleek like the
drawers do and the nice thing is the
drawers are very wide and you can take
this centerpiece out or you can have two
separate drawers
it is so amazing I also like about it
that you have a deep drawer medium
drawers and then you get into like a
smaller drawer for a little thing now
you may be asking yourself what is wrong
with this guy back here now I got this
at t.j.maxx and I think I paid like 40
bucks for it which unfortunately you
know how to J max goes they don't keep
this stuff in stock they just have what
they get in this is really cheaply made
it's very loud and I know it doesn't
seem that way but if you use it everyday
like I do it gets so annoying and
another thing is you see this right here
the George gets stuck all this and you
have to do this to get them to go back
in whether they are full or not they're
just constantly getting stuff so that
drives me crazy about this one it is a
good beauty box
it's just nothing compares to the
original beauty box this is such an
amazing
case and I cannot wait to fill it up
with you guys so let's get started
also this little piece right here is
from the original beauty box have all
kinds of stuff on their website but I
just put my favorite draw our lip
glosses and lipsticks in this little
piece so I could have them out in front
right in front of me
so I've cleaned out two of the drawer
spaces which was full of all my mascaras
I had the mascaras that I don't use as
much such as colorful ones and things
like that and then I had the mascaras
that I go to all the time I'm going to
be taking the third drawer out of my
beauty box here which is just like a
medium drawer and I'm going to keep the
divider in it here and put the ones that
use all the time and the ones I don't
use that often in this third drawer
so here we have our first door setup yay
and I just thought oh shoot I love it
because I can look right here in the
beauty box and see the product from the
front view and I'll be able to pick it
and then I put the shorter ones in the
back which I normally don't go for my
little minis as much I also have a
basket of mini muffins going to fit and
bud will just save that for another part
next thing I'll be knocking out is my
concealer drawers they don't even close
anymore they just hang open so I'm just
gonna pop it out and this has some
concealers in it as well and I'm going
to empty these two out
I'm taking this second drawer out of the
system and I'm going to try to fit all
the concealers just in this one half so
we'll see what happened
you
but now we have all our concealers that
fit in one spot and I did have two
primers in here for whatever reason that
I took out so that looks amazing I just
put the cream and heavier smaller tubes
in the back and I put the ones I use on
the regular and that our liquid
concealers right on top and in the front
as you can see here I have three drawers
of eye primers paint pots and these
little cream eyeshadows when I try to
condense these drawers into one I'm
going to try to fit all these in the
second half because it kind of goes with
concealers you know can you can conceal
your I don't know you guys this is just
my way of thinking and so I'm going to
try to put them all in here
you
so I'm thinking next I'm going to put
all my Garrard boxes and possibly
eyeliners in the next to half
the 401 is almost empty so I'm going to
go ahead and top it and then this one's
just in a package and I'm tired of the
package in here so I'm going to go ahead
and bust that one open and this one is
beautifully it completed the only thing
like I have in this your system over
here is real products and like tweezers
and scissors and things like that not
sure exactly how I want to go is
organizing these yet because they're not
that bulky and we have two more to fill
up basically I'm going to take the very
top drawer which is the skinniest and
I'm going to combine all the brow
products and tweezers and my colored
contact and try to fit them in the top
drawer here
basically I'm just going to take my two
favorite pairs of tweezers my lash
cutting scissors and a hair thing to
keep my hair back when doing my makeup
and I'm going to apply them in the
middle of this drawer over here and let
that be X I don't want the shore to get
ever proud that's the only thing that
sucks is that my dip brow pomade that I
use every day won't fit so how to put it
in my primer tour which is fine this guy
over here is officially empty besides
some products I don't know what I want
to do with there just to here's our
lovely original beauty box and we still
have two humongous spots to fill in it
and the rest of the products fit right
there come to an executive decision to
put facial primers in this bottom one
and we're going to see how many I can
fit
you
okay guys so here's a look at my makeup
vanity now and we look so much more
pretty and I took off you know the
lipstick thing so we have more space and
it's all conjoined it into one it just
looks cleaner and nicer I'm so excited
to do my makeup now because it's going
to look all pretty now I have some work
to do over here because I stacked up a
bunch of extra stuff but I feel like we
did such a good job today making the
beauty box look fabulous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
