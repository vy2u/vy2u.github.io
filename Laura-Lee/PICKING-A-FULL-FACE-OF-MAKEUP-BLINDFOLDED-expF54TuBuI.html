drop the cat trying to get my back job
great hey guys
hey guys what's up welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be real crazy
which is totally different from any
other video I film right not today we
are going to be filming a line to make
our like picking out my makeup
blindfolded and I saw Sylvia do with
this video that's the person that I saw
do it I'm not sure who created the
challenge but we want to give that
person credit in the comment section to
show them some love I did see Sylvia
filmed this a long time ago and I loved
her video so the way I did it I am just
open since I have like two or three
drawers with highlighters in it I picked
one and open it and I picked from the
drawers that were open so I would have I
wouldn't pick like three primers and no
foundation that was the whole video it
would make sense if that makes sense
I am very excited to do this video I
think it's gonna be hilarious I can't
wait to see what I pick out because I
have a lot of makeup that I don't wear
all the time I just have it to film
videos with to test it out you guys know
my first impression Queen without
further ado we're gonna sing to
subscribe song let's sing it together or
you can skip through it if you don't
like it subscribe to her channel before
you leave subscribe love you Laura
now we're gonna jump right into the
video
okay guys I literally can't see anything
I have this really tight in my eyes in
it kind of hurting my eyeballs hey hey
there's a cat sir she don't even know
basically I don't even know like what
this short is I'm just gonna pick an
item but do it during it's kind of like
lightly feel I mean I guess I'm lightly
feeling so you're like you I guess girl
trying to fill shapes though cuz some of
these items have no idea what this
that's how you're going oh my gosh fun
hmm
she knows the shape yeah powders oh yes
honey honey oh my god names yet there
was a girl an angel you can't play with
the cat's right now are we're filming
video just molesting all your drawers
hey Laura
bitch you must set the camera here are
the items I picked for this video I'm so
happy I picked this I'm not gonna lie I
felt the velvet but it could have been
prism it could have been subculture it
could have been their other one modern
Renaissance but I'm happy this one's on
top eyelashes yes this is this is good
NARS this is good I don't I think this
is my this is not necessarily my shade
but it will make it work Becca concealer
I don't know why I still have it because
I don't love it as you can see it's been
setting there for a little bit since
bye-bye pores I've not used this in
forever girl this is an amazing
highlight palette hi this video off in a
positive place bronzer I don't
necessarily use praise God we got Laura
Mercier oh man this blush shade I mean
it's not bad but it's literally probably
not gonna show up on me and then for my
spin tea lip color I'm so sad actually I
was hoping to get a fun color
but I literally got a color that I've
arty I think used on my channel Oh rosy
see this is like old and dry great oh it
like sharded water what is happening
this is not I'm not even talked about
what that mm-hmm worked out a little
turd little bit she had been sitting
there well wow so now you guys believe
me when I tell you I had been using it
so this well on my face I've never had a
bump right here in my life like almost
under my eyeball and it's hard as a rock
and it hurts it almost feels like a bug
bye next we'll put on this NARS
foundation I've really been liking it's
called the natural radiant long wear I
picked the shade hmm in one give it this
shake the shades been sitting there as
well oh this is brand new haven't used
this one because I found my shade that I
liked on this foundation but this a
minute we're gonna use our trusty y6
this shade actually will probably work
for me it just looks slightly light it
looks yeah just like a little bit off
but that's okay
it'll definitely it'll work out
oh it is a little too light I forgot a
brow product my Becca highlighter I got
the shade light which this one is so has
like this really pink undertone and it's
very liquidy without like a ton of
coverage so it's not my favorite
concealer so I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of it I'm gonna take my wife 6 as
usual and just blend that out as well
this brush is great for all cream
product so girl just blend away next I'm
gonna take thank goodness I got this
Laura Mercier a setting powder it's one
of my favorites I'm gonna go ahead and
just set that make it guys if you didn't
know which I know you don't know because
I haven't told you hello but I like
literally filmed on Sunday for like 12 I
kept powder my eye 12 hours and we
filmed a really cool video for my vlog
channel and it's just a project like oh
it's a passion project it's something
I've been wanting to do for like a
minute Sunday we finally got a chance to
do it and like find the time to do is so
I was like this passion project is
definitely gonna be a a weekend project
because I work Monday through Friday on
my channel my brand and then I normally
try to save the weekends for like things
I need you around my house
so like things any errands I need to run
like everyday life stuff I try to do on
the weekend but now I think I'm gonna
let my passion project take over my week
it's gonna be worth it anyway so now I'm
gonna move on to this Becca bronzer this
is bronze Bondi this is her sunlit
bronzer my eye is literally burning
because I stabbed it with powder I can
r14 which is one of my favorite brushes
for bronzer and contouring someone is
out there like weed eating leaf blowing
and I'm just hot can't we do it on the
weekend but the feel I can't hear it oh
honey this is I can't remember exactly
why I don't like go for this bronzer
that much it's pretty but it's like not
for me next I'm gonna dive into this
NARS blush and we're gonna see how it
plays out I'm gonna take a white board
brush and let's see how this works
it's picking it oh it's really pretty
just a little bit of color
I like this blush so this one is
actually called misconduct you know NARS
likes their little naughty names for
stuff so it's cute
highlighter I loved this little NARS pad
I'm gonna take like this lightest shade
actually maybe mix it in with this one
this is a r36
highlighter brush and it's my favorite
and you can see like like the drama that
literally enhanced the not on my face
I'm gonna go ahead and set it this is
the morphe prepping set here is the
stock glam palette it's really pretty it
is a warm tone neutral palette lots of
warmer Browns in it and then a couple
shimmer to go in with orange soda
orange soda is like one of the first
eyeshadow shades ever from ABH I
remember I feel like it came in the
lavish palette who remembers the lavish
palette who's like an OG AVH fan I
definitely am I used to always buy like
whatever they put out like that was just
like my thing and I really love the
lavish palette like I had hit pan on
like every color so I feel like orange
soda is like one of those colors that
they had since the beginning now I'm
gonna go in with the burnt orange shade
I'm gonna take Siena on an R 39 brush I
like to take just a little bit on the
tip of the brush and then start to work
it in because I want to deepen up that
outer corner of the eye you can really
start to push it on
that's lash glue right there so we'll
just pretend that's not there then we'll
start to soften out the edges next I'll
grab some mulberry and I'm basically
just gonna deepen up that outer corner a
little bit more I love a good dark outer
corner and I'll just grab a tiny bit of
knee or knee or Noor in that same brush
but just add it right there
let's take bronze on a four-to-one I'm
gonna hit it with a little bit of the
morphe prep and set and that way the
brush is dampened and then I'm going to
take this brush
I take the black shade on it 8:36 and
I'm just gonna kind of try to carve out
a little bit more I'm now gonna add some
roller lash little handy-dandy roller
lash
I'll grab Sienna on a 36 and just buff
that from the outer corner connecting it
right there and then just bringing it on
around I'll take the black shade on a
flat little brush like this which is
great for the lower lash line and just
get it really close to those lower
lashes
actually gonna pop some of fairy boom
right there to the inner corner because
it needs it needs a little Shazam next
is 450 very pretty color but I just feel
like it's like not matching I'm gonna
take some of this burnt orange go
something's got a gig just not add some
eyeshadow in with a lip color cuz it was
so peach and like in-your-face and it
kind of it match the eye look I love the
way like this little very soft cut
crease kind of turned out it's really
pretty and I love the palette I feel
like my foundation like compared to this
it's like a little light and not
matching you made it work hey so what do

fun video to film I love putting a spin
