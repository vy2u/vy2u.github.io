today
join the Laura Lee family mmm and let's
jump right in and get sorry to start off
with I need a run on my makeup
these are I makeup remover cloths but
you know we're gonna improvise dadgummit
wiped off my wing look at this pretty
little guy but what's left I will be
using different foundation brushes for
each foundation in a past dupes video I
mix the brushes like the foundations on
a brush and lord have mercy the YouTube
family was not happy about that so for
our first do we have
clinique beyond perfecting foundation
plus concealer and then we have the
Milania conceal and Perfector in one
foundation plus concealer so they kind
of have the same theme going on I'm
going to try one on one half and the
other in the other half let's see what
happens first I'm trying the Milani
foundation on this side of my face I
heard a lot of mixed reviews with the
Milani Foundation about it oxidizing
really bad and I didn't have that issue
whatsoever with it it worked out great
for me I really enjoyed this foundation
and I found that it was very Larry full
coverage because it's like foundation
and concealer get it
look how nice my skin looks over here I
mean you know there's like some
craziness going on and this is just one
small coat of the Milani foundation so I
really enjoy this I pumped out way too
much
dadgummit I've never tried this one
before so let's find out the details
let me disclaim this the colors of the
foundation will not be the same because
I buy foundation year-round and I can go
three to four shades darker in the
winter time really on the winter time Oh
have mercy what am i doing in the winter
right so now Matt Hague the gold handle
tart brush okay here is my skin and
believe it or not I feel like the Milani
one was a little bit thicker than the
Clinique one like a little bit more full
coverage than the Clinique one the theme
of the makeup the texture of like the
actual product feels the exact same so I
get the deep out of that the Milani just
has a little bit more coverage than the
Clinique but they are both nice covered
I mean I'm covered and covered well um
you can see the clinics a little bit
more wet I feel like the Milani has a
little bit more coverage and the
Clinique is it Smith bit shinier than
the money hmm
but overall I mean they could totally be
dupes I mean the price cut is unreal so
I would opt for the Milani alright our
next test is the True Match Lumi by
L'Oreal this is a really popular
foundation from L'Oreal and they say the
dupe for it is the Armani or they say
the dupe for low and unjust
this all up they say the Duke for
Giorgio Oh Marni luminous silk
foundation is the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi so I get it they're both like
luminous looming found a shion's I have
a really hard time believing that this
foundation is like 9 bucks in this one
65 I just have a hard time believing
they're dupes I've tried both of them in
the past so I'm very familiar with the
foundation so I'll be able to give you a
good rundown on this one first we'll try
out the Giorgio Armani luminous silk I
have to remember to pour or less cuz I'm
only doing half my face hunters get
crazy
we have our Giorgio Armani side done if
you can see like it's not that thick of
coverage but it does look really nice on
the skin so here I go my True Match Lumi
now I can go ahead and tell you the
shades are going to be pretty much off
applying this L'Oreal to my face the
application and the like liquid eNOS of
the product it feels very similar I feel
like to have the same amount of doing
this to them luminous to them so I get
that in the dupe part of it this one's
been on my face a little bit longer so
it's head and we're trying to settle
down I feel like the coverage of the
foundations are very similar
possibly the L'Oreal being a little bit
more coverage because I'm not seeing as
many of my freckles through as I am on
this side so thinking um the L'Oreal
True Match I kind of like better hello
hi you know what I'm going to say these
are doobs because the skin looks glowy
on both sides I mean I think though I
could build up to the lumi coverage very
easy with the giorgio monte so then
today i think they're definitely dupes i
get to say yes and i was so skeptical on
this one I honestly got this today and I
was like oh hell nah but we don't get it
anyway my skin looks pretty good it I'm
gonna start wearing the show mm-hmm I'm
gonna go ahead and be straight up with
you if you have oily skin I don't
recommend either of those foundations to
you they are luminous they make you glow
give you that healthy looking skin but
you have that natural glow that comes
from within if you have oily skin trust
me my forehead is a grease pit hit glows
night day morning afternoon lunch time
breakfast time if I could sell old my
forehead produces I'd be a rich woman
what is this be the hairdo wanna get
back there okay I apologize I forgot to
get close-up shots of my giorgio monte
lumi and the other one sorry for our
next step we have the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cushion essentially the same
foundation as the liquid but it's in a
cushion pitchers claims that the miracle
cushion at my Lancome is a dupe I've
tried this one before and I like it it
so it's the same as the liquid businet
cushion no time and then this one I've
never tried before actually z' picked it
up at sephora today so we're gonna find
out first I will apply the lumi True
Match cushion you get so much product in
these cushions do not let them fool you
oh where is this black coming from now
we are going to apply it the miracle
cushion from Lancome let's see if
Pinterest is telling us a big fat laughs
Mel's different the Lancome one smells
so good and the other one doesn't smell
anything but that isn't really much to
do with the performance oh my lord I got
a weight that we are so Orange over here
alright we're going to keep going with
it oh this foundation feels the exact
same I swear I know this videos gonna be
boring so I'm like agreeing with
everything Pinterest has to say but it
feels the same
it's very dewy feeling and you know what
they come with this paint same sponge of
the package the Lancome one packaging is
a little bit bigger than L'Oreal one I
feel like the coverage is the same again
I I feel like the coverage is medium and
you could possibly build it up to full
coverage if you set it with a powder and
all that jazz but guys the product looks
so good on both sides besides this side
because I'm really oranges that's my
home phone I'm going to be exchanging
this scam two more to go next up we have
the NARS all day luminous weightless
foundation I love this stuff and also
love this stuff this is the pro matte
infallible by L'Oreal or infallible Pro
matte and I do like both foundations a
lot these are great if you have oily
skin I would definitely set this one for
show I mean I would set this one to a
set list my foundations they are a
completely different texture but
apparently the finish outcome is very
similar with these so with the NARS
you're supposed to only do like a dot
for your whole face and I am going to
abide by those rules and I'm just going
to stipple the NARS one on this side of
my face look at that look how much color
and coverage you get you know what I'm
going to go ahead I mean the finish may
be the same but I really don't want to
call these dupes because I'm going to
tell you something
the texture and application
and like the weight of it is completely
different they do the same thing as far
as giving you a matte finish this one's
like a cream foundation that was a
liquid foundation I think they're a
little bit far off to become dupes I do
think you get a matte finish with both
by the way my L'Oreal pro mats a little
bit warm for me these days I totally get
it if you want to call them dibs because
the finish like the matte finish of them
is very similar I just think it's like
two completely different foundations
though and I'm not going to call these
two a dupe I'm just I am fifty shades of
orange on the side and fifty sage of
yellow on this side these foundations
are not my color but I wasn't going to
go buy these brand new you know just to
swatch them on my face let me say this
the finish is just very similar to these
but I feel like the NARS one is way
lighter on the skin and this one has
more of a heavy texture to it I'm going
to say no on these big dips but yet but
yes they do have the same finish to them
very matte babe my face hers he just
won't Pelle help me all right for our
last Pinterest do with the foundations
tested it is the Mac Studio Fix
Foundation versus the Madden poreless
fit me by Maybelline do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do I love both of these
foundations I think definitely the
product has a similar texture I can go
ahead and tell you that the actual fit
me is really a good shade for me it's
number 220 I'm going to apply that all
over my face
it says matte and poreless but does
anyone else feel like the fit me is not
like super matte like the Loreal Pro
matte this one just has a little bit
more of a natural finish now i'm going
to take my morphe 44 brush and apply the
Mac Studio Fix now can tell you both
foundations are definitely buildable
foundations and I find them to be pretty
long way
I'm going to go ahead and say what I've
said a thousand times the foundations
are most long-wearing when you set them
on the powder and I set mine with the
powder so if you're experienced in them
not being long wearing tested out with a
powder and see how that treats you I
definitely say the coverage of the
foundations is super similar you know
what I've been wearing both of these
foundations for a long time and I never
thought of them as dupes but I
definitely want to consider them dupes
because you know what they look very
similar on my skin like the finish of
them is very similar and it's because
the Mac foundation doesn't dry it all
moisturize with a little bit more of a
natural finish I will go ahead and tell
you this one can get a little bit greasy
err on me faster whenever I wear it
throughout the day whereas this one it
kind of hangs with me it just doesn't
have so much greys enough
all right guys that is oh you just slam
the door that is it for this video thank
you all so much for watching and being
here oh this video was interesting and
kind of fun I feel like my face is kind
of raw right now from all the makeup
wipes but we did it haha alright guys be
sure and subscribe before you leave and
I'll catch you in my next video I'm
talking to you back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
