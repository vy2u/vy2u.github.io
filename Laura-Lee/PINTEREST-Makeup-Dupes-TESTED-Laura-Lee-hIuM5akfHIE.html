video is going to be fun and interesting
and different from any videos that are
I've done really I have for ever been on
Pinterest as a lot of us have and you
know the makeup and hair or the beauty
and hair section where you see the dupes
and it seems too good to be real well in
today's video I'm going to be testing
out those Pinterest makeup dupes and
seeing if they are really dupes or is
Pinschers blowing smoke up are missing
like my nose highlight also in this
video
towards the end I test out two - eye
primers and then I show you a mini
tutorial on how I got this look on my
eyes so if you want to stay to the end
of the video and see how I did my eye
shadow well then hang out with me until
the end I'm gonna tell the truth
are they really dupes or is it a big fat
scam why I was too dramatic if you
hadn't subscribe to my channel yet why
not join my youtube am gym today we're
gonna jump right in the video and get
started always some food in my teeth
our first do comparison is going to be
film - on and it's going to be the
Bobbie Brown this is the foundation
stick in natural tan which I mean the
shades whatever your shade is but I'm
going to use natural tan hoping this is
my right shade and normally used to
stick to contour my face with minami's
your foundation today so I bought a new
one in natural tan I don't really know
if it's gonna be my shade but we hope it
will be
it just says I dupe for it is the Revlon
Photoready insta thick stick and I just
watch this on my hand already for the
first time and it felt absolutely
amazing on the skin this one is 170
golden beige or more so comparing
formulas here not colors hopefully they
won't be too often because that all my
face to look crazy so start with the
expensive side which is going to be over
here yes I'm just gonna like draw fruit
few lines this is a pretty thick
foundation I might add what are we using
my trusty f80 kabuki from Sigma Beauty
and I'm just going to softly blend that
in which it looks like is blending out
pretty nice
okay so I think I like killed it with
the color man 4.25 that is my shade it
looks so good it has a nice yellow
undertone to it as well
so this looks nice I did add like a few
extra strokes and places just to build
up some coverage and then blend it out
with this kabuki out let's test out the
Revlon photo finish stick and this one
has a little bit more pink to it but it
looks like it's not going to be too all
for my skin tone I'm just going to do
the exact same thing using a different
makeup brush going to use my angled
kabuki which is the f88 and blend this
one out so this one is the Revlon
blended out I think that they both look
nice on the skin I added a little bit of
extra of the Revlon as well as the Bobbi
Brown so I feel like I added the same
amount of each use different brushes to
blend them out and like the Bobbi Brown
has a little bit more coverage than the
Revlon which I guess you could build up
to the covers that you want the texture
of them feels the exact same on my skin
you could fill the makeup on your skin
it's not like super lightweight makeup
um the both look nice on my skin so what
I say these are a dupe I would say there
are duplicate another I think they're
both awesome products and they're both
very similar the packaging is a lot
heavier at the Bobbi Brown's you can
tell it's nice or packaging but when you
talking about packaging here we are
talking about the product but that being
said the product I think you could
totally get away with just wearing the
robe on a stick and it will be just as
beautiful as the Bobbi Brown foundation
moving on to our next product that
Pinterest says is they do but why am I
saying picture so aggressively our next
do Pinterest says that romantic rose by
Milani and exposed by Tarte cosmetics
Amazonian clay blush our dupes they look
quite different in the packaging but
they said their doobs and actually
expose comes off a little bit darker
than it does in the packaging so they
they have potentially you see how it
gets darker the more you use it with the
swatches on my hand right here they look
identical I'm going to go ahead and tell
you I can guarantee you that the Thar
time is Amazonian clay blush will wear a
long
than the Milani the formula is meant to
wear for 12 hours in Milan II don't say
nothing about them kind of sorts of
things I'm for mini Milani blushes and
they last like a normal blush I mean
they're not bad blushes but they don't
last like a tart blush so I can tell you
I literally just dug my nail across this
blush right here all right
always happens to me anyways all my all
my makeup has like scratches in it you
would think a cat is doing my makeup I
went ahead and added a little bit of
concealer and contour we can move on to
applying the blush I will apply it
romantic rose by Milani this is an f40
brush from Sigma and I'm just going to
pop it on to the apple of my cheek and
blend it on backwards mind you this is
the more affordable side of my face and
this is the bougie side of my face now
for the bougie side of my face I'm going
to take the exposed from Tarte and apply
it
I like applied so much blood they look
identical and my opinion like I said
before the Tarte one is gonna last a
little bit longer if that bothers you if
your blush being gone you know really
quick really bothers you out for a Tarte
blush but if it doesn't the cheaper
option is definitely the Milani romantic
Rose blush hello Pinterest did not lie
they are pale and true saying okay
Pinterest okay that's two for you zero
for Laura
moving right along one I have seen on
Pinterest for a long time so it's the
Tarte all-over stick versus the NARS
this is Luxor stick so first we're going
to just apply lilac petal look at that
we should leave inside to hell with it
and the next one is the Luxor stick
which looks like this and look the exact
same so far I'm just going to blend it
out with my finger because we're not
going to get crazy up in here this one's
like more creamy the other one's more
powdery so the texture is a little bit
different they look the same in the
packaging they do look a little bit
different and the NARS one does blend
out a little bit easier into a powder
form this one's a little bit of a
heavier cream form and takes
more to blend out but once it's blended
out on the skin
you can't tell their friends Pinterest
was right again three for Pinterest zero
for Laura we have more coming right up
now okay the next one is also a
highlight I'm just going to test these
out on my hand because I'm not going to
be able to on my face so it says sin the
benefits high-beam and the whipped eye
light from ELF and lilac petal are dupes
one another they look so much different
in the packaging though so I'm having
trouble believing this okay there's no
way these are going to be tubes look at
that it's completely different these are
not dupes these look completely
different I mean they're close they are
similar I give I give Pinterest that but
the whipped one has way more pink in it
and then the high beam is a little bit
more white undertoned don't say they're
direct oops
high beam is a lot thinner than the
whipped formula so the formula is a
little bit different in the color is a
little bit different can I get a point
for this one I'm going to go ahead and
get myself a point I'm going to go ahead
and say they are different they're not
dupes I mean they're close whatever the
light hits them like that they're close
but whenever the light's not on them you
can definitely tell that it's two
different highlights like if I put one
on one cheek and one on the other you
would definitely be able to tell Laura
gets a point yeah holding on to the eyes
Pinterest has called several times mind
you they have called the Milani
eyeshadow primer in the Urban Decay eye
primer potion dupes with one another so
we're going to try it out here is my
bougie side and you know what they feel
the exact same though whenever I rub
them on my finger so let me put some
Milani over here maybe a little bit more
Milani
but the true test is with the eye shadow
so they're blending out the exact same
like you can't tell I show you guys how
I do my eye shadows into this video but
real quick I want to do another dupe and
then we'll test out the eye shadow one
one a Pinterest they had the LA girl
rebel and Aria as dupes rebel it's my la
girl arias by Stila I can go ahead and
tell you this one is
way more drawing and then the steel ones
the Silla ones sit really nice the way
I'm going to be able to do this is apply
one to my upper lip and one to my lower
lip over line the hell about those lips
girl here I go with the LA girl rebel
look the same I'm gonna let them finish
drying while we do the eyes and then the
end will come back and you know tell
want safe dried and all what they
actually look like and the texture of
them so now let's do the Eyres
starting with a tutorial I'm going to go
in with pris pot this is a nice soft
orange color which I just blend all over
the soften up eye primer and I'm using
it ether t8 blending brush from Sigma
Beauty to do this then I move on with
breeches which is the perfect transition
shade and I blend this on the crease and
dabble it a little that's a weird word
to use and then I move it a little bit
into that outer corner just to smoke it
out very lightly I'm basically applying
this the same way I applied pressed pot
kinda all over in the crease next I take
fried which is one of my favorite colors
from the palette and I blend this into
the crease this just gives it a little
bit of a smoke down yellowy undertone
look I promise it looks good in the end
and next I'm going to take Bub's on a
little bit of a smaller dome shape brush
and I push it just into the outer corner
being sure to keep this matte dark shade
low you don't want to bring it up too
high because we're kind of creating a
halo smoky eye and I'm also going to
wiggle it right into that inner corner
I'm not touching the center and just
blend it throughout the top of the
crease next my favorite part applying
with a pencil brush is Yoshi Yoshi has a
dual chrome shade it's such a cool shade
it looks a little bit green it looks a
little purple it looks a little grey no
one really knows exactly what shade
yoshi is but whenever the light hits it
in the center of the eyes it looks
absolutely beautiful and it makes the
eyes pop and glow this is such a great
look then I take a little bit of my
liquid liner and make a wing this is the
most pitiful wing tutorial ever showed
you but I do have a full dedicated video
on how I create my winged liner next I'm
going to go back in with the bottom has
spoken out with fried and then I smoke
it out again with whiskers which is to
say warm expresso
brown color and lastly I just add a
little bit of liner okay guys I
definitely have to say that these two
eye primers with the exact same my
eyeshadows blend it out just as evenly
on both eyes like I couldn't tell a
single bit of difference so I've always
loved this Milani eyeshadow so I would
definitely recommend this one for sure
lastly for my lips they look the exact
same dry could you believe that two
completely different colors and brands
of liquid lipsticks on my lips right now
