cute in this time you can sing good I
shouldn't like make you sing like the
whole thing by yourself
you left it perfect
take it away why do I look like a little
mushroom today oh hey guys welcome to my
channel I was very nice yes I'm so happy
to be yeah right I'm kind of in my own
studio but I'm so excited to be doing
this video me and Huggies been trying to
collapse I know forever and ever and we
finally are here and we got some weird
like we knew you guys would wanted to
test out something a little strange like
they would want that right yes we both
love doing that so why not that's right
to opinion all in one video
I have a quite strange product when are
we testing up today yes we had the
professional pore minimizing makeup hmm
and it is kind of weird what do you
think it is I have hi host so I'm like I
have to take a pause though because I'm
waiting for you to do the subscribe
oh are you saying it was me I really are
you ready okay whenever I'm watching
Laura's videos I literally like that's
the part that I didn't like super
Bissell yeah and I'm like what am i
doing I am anything yourself and I could
never do that actually on my channel you
know why why there's like this weird
thing where as I tell people to
subscribe to my channel oh I'm like
shameless promotion it was proposed
describe everybody don't do that on my
channel that's all like oh subscribe let
me hit that button whoops we're going to
jump right in and get started huh yes we
are
let's do it let's do it everybody needs
to know about this foundation all right
we have instructions with this
foundation and we tie
peek down them a little bit yes it says
um there's mushrooms in them or a
mushroom X I'm not one mushroom extract
known to minimize the appearance of
pores yes so it covers imperfection
without clogging your pores good reduces
redness and the look of pore so it
doesn't physically make them smaller
it's just the appearance dang it I know
instantly modifies and controls excess
surface all for eight hours oh oh that's
not okay yeah you know what
it just happens I know that everybody
that gets around you like they pick up a
little bit of the idea but this happens
so quickly with a bit oh my god copies
over here lying I guess all of our you
foundation it also does mention that you
should use it with the benefit
Porefessional for smoother than smooth
results it actually says that so I think
we should try our faces
alright it isn't actually one of my like
ride-or-die favorite primers I think
it's great because it really does matter
I'm forty does yes and even shine like
about a shiny forehead you can put this
on there a little bit and you can see it
like dulls a shine a bit it really does
oh my god typing patiently right now why
I feel like I've done this in a dream no
I'm actually not even being dramatic for
the camera like you ever had this weird
moment yeah I literally feel like I've
been here before in Italy you like
glanced down like I was looking at the
hot cheetos and then the hair clips and
I'm like I've done stop so how does it
end I don't know but you know what
someone told me about de Josue I want to
know is that it means you're on the
right track so interesting yeah I like
that
okay so it's all good maybe foundation
is meant to be I hope so if it's a
little strange it's a little strange
right so it says shake it well which I
agree cuz I'm not going to lie I like
busted open and then it looks kind of
like weird water watery and it got a
little sticker when I shook it so and
then it has a poor blowing sponge base
and you're supposed to press the button
release when did she drop onto the spot
okay I would straight onto the sponge
but I got her shave three so if it
doesn't work out my fault huh
yeah cause your fallen Laura ready I'm
gonna want you how many drops does it
say two two three
no wait oh not so weird the whole thing
is really hard so it obviously has this
little things like Run button one two
three maybe a little more who are like
six seven eight or good and a coverage
girl so are you going to look I'm going
to doing behind I didn't like six but
that's not like a lot yeah Cheers
okay okay so then it says Pat and then
blend on to pour problem areas or all
over your face and then you can repeat
to build coverage yeah I've always got
oh look at me this is weird
it had me read out quite a bit like I
like actually is getting like a lot of
going so far ladies I just did my whole
my whole cheek actually okay this is
funding a little awkward a hold because
the little ends kind of tiny and it's
kind of like awkward you know hmm I
agree it's not the end of the world but
I actually I don't really like how the
sponge is blending be honest
yeah I'm really curious to see how this
will work with a Beauty Blender like the
other side of our face with a Beauty
Blender yeah I'm going to do the other
side with that just to see account think
that I'm it's just pushing the product
around too much and I'm more and like
this kind of an action you know agreed
why is this color 20 change it dark have
you seen you or wait but you're only
four and minus 3 u 3 I'm gonna oh damn
girl you didn't look that what about the
week isn't orange okay a little wiggle
or I mean it's not I was trying to
angling Oliver's concealer I think you
could make it work but I really want to
do this yeah me too are you ready I'm
actually going to fix this side too yeah
yeah let's see you though yeah that
color looks a little more like me you've
warned it's super liquidy mm-hmm I can
be T blender better already
me too I'm actually really a taking the
time
with the Beautyblender exactly works my
cell on floor decides looking kind of
sort of pretty with yes this is not full
coverage it says you can build it up for
a little bit of coverage I don't know
about that yeah this is more light to
medium and my opinion it's not bad
though it does dry down completely mad
it is minimizing pores I didn't see it
drying down all the way Matt either like
that's shocking me a little bit because
I don't know why I was skeptical about
that
you thought it was going to try to I
didn't think it was I thought it's gonna
be like super wet looking no I know
because it's so liquidy mom I think
you're going to put it on and it's going
to be super wet and liquidy but this is
Matt yep but not crunchy Matt because
it's not sick so that's good yeah so if
you're like a full beat girl out there
I'm going to go ahead and say it
I don't think it's gonna be your best
friend I don't hate this
I like this color for me actually yeah
there are others right for me to do
we're similar in color I mean yeah this
is $30 too so it is a high-end product
but I feel like you know a lot of the
other foundations out there a little bit
more than this little little high-end
foundations cost a little more than
their okay you know what I want to test
though I'm just because I'm like going
for it I'm just going to go in the
Clarisonic a little bit see if that
doesn't
yes that's working actually great I did
not think there was cocaine out this
great mm-hmm
the Clarisonic I feel like your products
going stretching further means
Clarisonic works with super liquidy best
so this I probably wouldn't even need
that much what fair mm-hmm I feel like
it would go way longer mm-hmm and it's
hot outside so we're going to wear this
for a few hours and see if it breaks
down or does anything weird I like you I
think my skin looks pretty I think a
family hair nothing here looks really
good too uh-huh like really good I'm not
gonna lie this before skeptical that we
wrote for Caroline mm-hmm we're like
smells are only liquidy I don't know
about the cumbria I thought I was gonna
because I like to make it forever aqua
yes which really you put on the skin and
unfortunately it was just like a gel
moisturizer nothing almost you know
coverage this is actually giving me some
coverage not full no not full but here
maybe medium but what's nice is usually
do you find with sheer products they're
more I won't say greasy they're more
moisturizing y'all have a sheer matt is
something really rare there's rarely a
sheer Matt coverage product hmmmm so
this is definitely unique product we are
given that yes all right delivery where
it's a little bit mm-hmm and see what
the tea is going to be all right we'll
be back all right guys we're back coffee
just finished blaming my makeup for me
yeah zero zero responsibility for the
haha myself
I have some mint green I don't know what
you call this going on now I got makeup
running down my I have fibers on my face
which let me just say really quick
before we jump into the rest of this
video you guys got a head over to Tobi
channel we tested out some weird product
I mean she pulled out the Beauty room
yep and be sure and subscribe to talkies
channel before you leave and um she was
five videos a week so if you're looking
for a consistent youtuber to connect
with you
eight - to find the truth about products
super honest channel head over to the
glam less room pink your of course it's
all true I wouldn't lie to you and all
her socials and everything will be
linked down below as well so you're
being so nice to me for someone that
just made you try out really horrible
merica I'm forgiving I literally opened
a drawer and I'm like look I have all
this weird stuff to play with
why not and then we kind of ended up a
little bit and then we ended here and
ended up here the foundation yes the
foundation is what the people want to
know about yes and let me tell you I'm
not mad at it I'm not either it honestly
was very skeptical going into this now I
haven't watched any reviews on the
foundation but I was on either was so
watery and weird in the containers weird
and this is giving me but the I'd
actually performed pretty well it did I
really I'm not going to lie I thought
this would be a joke I bet Laura I don't
know like I kind of think it's going to
be awful but I have to tell you guys
there's a lot of light in this room and
it heats up into film I kill the
air-conditioning yeah so it's kind of
like we're sitting in a sauna right now
imagine that and you still look
completely mad yeah I cannot believe my
forehead isn't it completely the mole
pot no me too because I get oily in my
t-zone so bad I usually have to like
reap out or reap out or eat out it I
have not touched up and it's been a
while and I don't know I'm it just it's
not full coverage but if you want to
stay matte and have a little bit of
coverage yes this is where that it also
doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything I
never run on getting into SML lines
which a lot of matte foundation stands
probably getting my smile lines I have a
work Iowa Oh No I take the cake oh it's
not that compelling yes it's just it
like clinging to your skin so just make
sure you blend it out nicely but I would
totally use this again I would feel I'm
going to say for now as a first
impressions I like that you know I don't
like the applicator though I recommend
the beauty blender then was a little
weird
hmm I'm like breaky to Romania right
you're glad thank you guys so much for
watching thank you for being here we
appreciate it and thank you talk to you
