video is going to be very interesting
because it is going to be fun and
magical lip powder that turns into
lipstick right I'm not that excited
about the color but it could be really
cute I found this product on wanna low
which is a website with the most random
stuff in the world and it is basically a
really cool product that I wanted to
test out so then I googled how to use it
because the directions are in a foreign
language and I am not sure which
language that is and then the video that
popped up was takis video so tacky has
reviewed this on her channel she's so
good explaining things so I to be
testing out today I kind of have an idea
of how to use it I'll also link Toni's
video down below if you want to check it
out and see her review of it but wish me
luck we're going to jump right in and
get started with this little booger and
don't forget subscribe my channel before
you leave okay let's get started alright
guys I got my close-up lens on so you
can see way too much information
literally everything come on you guys to
get a good look at the product
he says re ray on it and it comes in
this little ones the cool tube and just
so you can see the box that it came in
quite interesting so let's open her
little book it's such a short little
applicator it's like a little book it
reminds me like at the top of the little
troll how it doesn't smell like anything
which is not a bad sign and then if you
look down in there it's just like powder
powder powder so I'm going to sprinkle
oh shoot it pours out really fast so I
don't want to sprinkle some in my hand
whoa did you see do you see how it's
powder oh it is pouring everywhere good
job lar and now we're going oh my god
it's so cool now we're going to oh god
we're going to rub it and it just
literally turned into lipstick it turned
into a cream
I'm sugar I am shook guys everybody
should experience this on their own like
this is a moment such a strange product
and wiping it off I mean it hasn't been
on my finger but a second it came out
pretty good with just a little makeup YP
so it doesn't seem like it's going to
stain show Connie shook okay so what I'm
gonna do is literally blow over all over
my desk because it is like super
fine-grained powdery my head is itching
my extensions okay here we go I'm going
to open her
oddly enough it feels like a little wet
on my lips but it's so pretty
I wish that applicator was a little
longer because this little boogers kind
of hard to hold on to but Oh blue powder
in my eye there was some powder down in
there nice I like sniffles my nose and
my eye
oh yeah this is dangerous this is such a
class product like I know like this
stuff is so cool to get a good coat on
you definitely have to add like three
layers of it I would say it's bizarre
that it feels wet whenever you put the
powder on your lips and then you just
rub back and forth and it turns into
like slick lipstick by the way this is
freckle right there on my lips a lot of
people ask I just breathe it in oh my
god it was the face like sniffling and
breathing it in oh she's very oh God so
creamy okay guys so this is a little bit
patchy right in here I'm going to add a
little bit more to see if we can't get
that to us hang in there that's better
am i people working it off I don't know
it seems to get strange in there like
keeps disappearing so I'm going to be
honest with you guys this is probably
one of the coolest products I've ever
reviewed and it was actually very
successful it's exactly what it says it
is it is such a powdery product that you
just mush it around and it goes from
almost feeling like flour into shred of
lipstick it is so cool it the color
looks really pretty on my lips which I
mean these are two different colors it
gets obviously a lot darker once you mix
it up I mean I wasn't like living for
this baby pink but then once I got on my
lips I turned into like deep hot pink it
actually turns into more of the color on
the box which is good kind of advertises
what's going to turn into this was so
cool I'm going to find it and link it
down below I mean this would be I think
so much fun for anyone to try out I
don't know how safe it is to breathe in
but I'm pretty sure I inhaled a lot of
just because the powder so fine grain
which is like
everywhere it's not kiss proof so it's
suddenly not that long wearing but it's
a beautiful lip color once I added like
three layers of it it looks pretty even
on my lips and yeah it took me a lot of
powder till I get my full lips covered
but I think was really affordable if I'm
not mistaken and yeah let's play with
the powder just one more time for the
sakes of the video you know and it's
really compact you know to carry licking
your purse all right there she is now
I'm going to take the powder and rub it
and now we have lipstick tell me that's
not the coolest
I adored it so yeah my I give this like
an A+ this crust worked which was some
good scoop any other thank you guys so
much for being here and watching up see
you all in my next video be sure and
subscribe to my channel for you leave
for lots of more videos coming up and
I'll see you in my next video do you
love how close-up I am talking to you

goodness hopefully you weren't looking
at my nose hairs the whole time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
