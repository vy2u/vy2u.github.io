video is gonna be way different from any
video of ever filmed actually saw this
video on Jackie ie News Channel I love
that girl hijacker she did it makeup
swirl with products that didn't work for
her no hate is a strong word and it's a
word I don't like to use I'm a firm
believer in the theory that in order to
hate anything or someone you must have
once love that thing or that person so I
don't hate these products yeah that was
some food for thought but necessarily
hate these products they just didn't
work for me I think this video is a
great idea because I can actually show
you why they didn't work for me yeah and
I might save you some money Brenda jump
right in and get started be sure to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
for more wacky videos like this one and
let's get started whoo I also have a big
zit on my forehead hi not my face hey
guys we're gonna jump right in and get
started the primer that I don't hate
this primer and I'm not like oh but it
didn't do anything for me it did just
about much as much for me as is not
wearing a primer so I thought this one
was just a little bit of a waste this is
the combination skin primer from
covergirl fills I mean call me crazy but
like low-key stinky it feels like
sunscreen if I was like putting
sunscreen in my face
I hate the feeling of sunscreen next up
I'm gonna going in with another
covergirl product which I wasn't
obsessed with this is the covergirl
clean matte this is their newer
foundation which I'm just absolutely not
obsessed with it doesn't do much for me
and it feels it almost feels a little
bit grainy on the skin I don't care for
it and I won't be wearing it except for
in this video mmm so it's not the worst
foundation in the world like I said but
I won't be wearing it it's just
something I wouldn't spend my money on
again now I heard from you guys that the
BB cream is way better than the
foundation which actually went out on
both the BB cream haven't tried it yet I
know you guys just knew I was about to
tell you my thoughts on it and now I'm
like I don't know so this is what I mean
it's not so bad it just smells like
chemicals and I don't like the finish of
it it's like it's trying to be mad but
it's not quite mad I'm just not obsessed
with it we're gonna go ahead and do our
eyebrows so I actually have two brow
products that I'm not in
love with this is the brown powder this
is a universal brow product from it
cosmetics it's I think it's supposed to
work on any and every eyebrow and it
looks like chalky and gray whenever you
get it and then I find that the product
it doesn't come off with the flip look
at that I've had two of these and they
were sent to me but I don't like them
alone I definitely don't recommend them
it's like I'll never get my brow filled
in with it because it's not coming off
and I don't see how it's a universal
brow product I mean I guess the harder
you press the darker it gets so if you
didn't press so hard it would be a light
lighter brow product but um it's just
too much to fight and work with I
definitely liked my benefit brow pencils
as well so honest Tashia ones way better
also the tip on this one is like really
it's like a big oval and it's hard to
get a precise brow next one
I don't hate again I don't hate it but
it's a little bit too waxy for me this
is the colour-pop brow pencil and
they're very affordable so I don't think
they're so bad for the price but they're
way too pigmented and they have so much
wax in them I feel like my brow look a
little cry cry whenever I get done using
them all so I grab the color redhead and
this is not my color so that it just
happened so I'm going to finish filling
this brow in with the universal brow
pencil in hopes to fix some of the
damage I just created both so I have
like a reddish brow and a universal brow
over here I don't necessarily have a
shadow primer that I just despise and
don't like so and I dug and dug and dug
but like I said I'd get rid of most
products that don't work for me so I'm
just going to be using my concealer
stick which is what I'm going to be
using to conceal when today as my
eyeshadow primer which I do this a lot
she's going to go ahead and conceal so
the thing I don't like about this color
pop a stick here is meant to highlight
but I also feel like it does it like
vanishes to nothing on the skin they're
so easy to use because it's like in a
stick form so you can just color all
over your face but feel like once you
start blending it out it literally
blends out to nothing like it just
vanishes
I'll show you we're going to take the
morphe g36 brush and we're
is going to tap out the product
and I still have a full dark circle and
I just I can't tell if the product was
even there they blend out so easily but
it's just like it's gone go ahead and
get started on the eyes recently in my
ELF tested out a video I tried out Matt
I tried a palette which I loved but then
I also brought this one to the table in
the video and colors are not pigmented
they almost looked invisible on my eyes
first I'm going to go in with this
orange color which I love starting out
with warm tone shades to blend in the
eye then I'm going to go into this
little taupey brown color right here
this is an e25 brush from sigma and i do
love this brush i don't have a set of
makeup brushes that I hate so let me
just disclaim that
now I'm going to add a little bit of the
deeper brown color into the crease next
so this deep Brown I'm not going to lie
is not that bad now for the eyelid I'm
going to go in with this cranberry shade
I love cranberry eyeshadows I'm going to
grab a little bit on this brush this is
the e55 brush from Sigma I don't know if
else uses different manufacturers
because not all their eyeshadows are bad
obviously like in my elf tutorial I show
you guys some that I love also going to
go in with the light shimmery shade
right here and I'm just going to add
this to the brow bone to highlight
now I'm going to go in with a eyeliners
I've tried out a few times and it has
never worked for me so here we are again
trying out this is the curvy liner by
Maybelline I think that the one on it is
super gimmicky this is not going to be
my best eyeliner mind you because I had
so much trouble maneuvering this one
I'm not gonna lie I did pretty good with
that liner I'm impressing myself oh my
god that was my fault not the eyeliners
Oh what is my problem today that line
this liner turned out really pretty but
I'm going to show you right now I've
done three layers so it will cover the
eyeshadow and do it justice but I just
don't like that it dry shiny and I will
tell you that is a personal preference
not like a like a staple thing that's
bad about the thing that's more like
something I don't personally like about
it I know we are using a lot of
drugstore products that I don't like
we'll get into some higher-end products
I don't like in just one minute just
just give me a minute all right I'm
going to finish the eyes in a minute I
want to move on to bronzer for bronzer I
have this bare mineral sheer sun this is
a serum bronzer I think see your own
bronzer sometimes are a little bit
gimmicky it comes out like this and I'm
just going to do like a tiny amount of
it on my hand and then I'm going to
contour my face with it
I'm gonna take my stippling brush and
pick up some of the product and then I
start to stipple it around my face you
see how like patchy this is it's very
hard to get blended out
um and once you try to blend it out
you've moved the product around so much
it's no longer where you want it the
bronzer is just kind of all over your
face it's really hard for me personally
to work with a serum bronzer oh that
looks like a circled blob of bronzer on
my face it kind of looks like it's all
over the place and it feels very wet so
now we're going to set our makeup were
to go in with a little bit of the large
Eller this is their universal setting
powder and once you get it all off it
just looks like you put a highlighter
all over your face kind of sorta and let
me show ya I'm gonna take my brush
misson supposed to put like a filter on
your face like an Instagram filter I
look at the texture on my skin now from
this I don't recommend using this at all
to set your makeup you will look like a
purple glowing disco ball but I'm doing
it for the YouTube I'm starting to turn
purple do you see this and this is
supposed to be just like an all
over situation for the under eyes I'm
using the NYX setting powder this is the
purple color correcting one purple is
supposed to be for brightening but I
really don't like this one it kind of
makes it look even almost yeah let me
just show you a little sponge and we'll
set it like we normally would do you see
the purple ten is supposed to have a
purple tint purple is supposed to award
off dullness and bring a brightness to
your skin while that setting we're going
to do a little bit of mascara mascara
that I didn't care for was by covergirl
it is the Katy Perry mascara it just
didn't do much for my eyelashes it
didn't do much lifting them and then the
wand of it is a little bit gimmicky it
looks like a spiral and now we are free
to dust away this product do you see
that there's like this purple hue tint
underneath my eye now and yet we still
have the dark circle because the high
light concealer did not do anything to
do any color just vanished on my face I
do like the NYX CC banana powder it
doesn't leave as much of a hue to your
skin but I just see like looking at me I
just see a little bit of purple through
here not good so I actually have some
lashes that I really don't like and I'm
going to put them on and you'll see why
these are actually a nice brand of
lashes these are by house of lashes and
again this these are bohemian princess
this is just a preference but they look
so fake II and just harsh for lack of
better words so I'm gonna apply them the
glue I do like I don't have any lash
glue that I hate so I'm just gonna put
it on with some lash glue a little live
also whenever I put these lashes on I
feel like they go straight out as much
as I try to push them up up unless my
eyes are wide ope your hands need to
tell in of them but they're not like
Viva boom lashes which is what I
typically opt for I'm going to go back
in with a good brown color in this
palette and try to smoke out my lower
line
line and now I'm going to add some more
of that mascara to my lower lashes and
for my lips I have this liquid lipstick
from went wild that I don't care for the
texture of it and I despise the color of
it over I don't recommend buying this
just for the quality of the product I
don't like it and the colors up to you I
mean I can't say not to buy it because
the color I mean come on
alright so I finish applying the lip
product and you can see I tried honestly
I tried hard to get it even and it's
just a really uneven lip product and
lastly we're gonna add a little bit of
highlight I'm using south and gentle
from Mac I don't like this product
because it is so dusty flakey and dry if
I had my assistant and have a brand on
it I would never guess that this is a
Mac product but it's a pretty horrible
consistency of product and not only that
I mean dust day and so then whenever you
apply the product you literally get
almost zero highlight like where up my
highlight at I'm not gonna lie I've
already applied this to my face
because I thought I was recording my
camera decide the stop recording thanks
camera thank you I applied this all over
and as you can see for a Mac that's not
good we're going to show you the dust
that flaked off at this highlight while
I was brushing it so I got termites in
my mouth so this is the final look as
you can see the eye shadow is just not
as pigmented as I like and blend it out
like I like it's a little bit patchy my
liner is very shiny I messed up right
here that was me but I told you I'm not
good with that freaking gimmicky wand on
it I don't like the way my false lashes
look they shoot out so straight at brow
over here with the universal brow pencil
is so blurred and patchy that it doesn't
look like a clean nice eyebrow looks
like I had trouble drawing in my
eyebrows right here this one looks
better but the product is so waxy on it
it can rub right off I have dark circles
I look purple and my whole face is shiny
