video is going to be another video with
me applying price my face it didn't work
out for me or that I don't like and I
did this once before and you guys really
liked it because I think it's a little
bit better just because it really
explains a lot of the product didn't
work out versus me just telling you like
you can see why I didn't work out yes
we're going to that's what's going to
happen in today's video also I picked up
my face but on the poll of my sister
before I got started and then I got in
my magnifying mirror and as I start
picking at my face and my war were you
doing your up this home video well so
now I look like I've been in a nest of
beehives and been stung in the face so
BC like red well that's what's going on
let's just count this as a relatable
moment also I'm giving away two MacBook
Airs allows you to do is be subscribed
to my channels when one any other way
I'm giving away if you're subscribed to
my vlog channel or leave LA so be sure
and subscribe just your way into March v
I'm in an oversized sweatshirt today and
like I'm a little hair thing on and I
didn't fix my hair today I'm just not
the one like I feel like I post so many
videos I'm like Hello or I'm just like
so I really have to go all out and every
single video like you guys know me I'm
at home right now I'm chilling I'm
trying to tell you things they didn't
work out for me alright Jeff Ryan get
started let's know our all zoomed in so
you can really see the beehive seem to
literally lower you and any girl you
went in on your voice throughout this
video I don't actually have a primer on
Dec that I don't like mustard type I
don't like a product I'll send it one of
my friends way or didn't donate it you
know it may work out for somebody else
it didn't work out for me I'll just
throw away makeup just so you know
that's not going to whip out a primer
and say I don't like it just for the
sake of the video like I just don't have
a primer on text that I'm really not
liking so we'll jump into foundations do
they used to do my makeup all the time
without a primer it's it's not going to
end your life you know what I mean fat
moisturize my face with a good
moisturizer that I love so to prep my
skin I'm moisture as a product it didn't
really work out for me this is some pure
minerals liquid bill this is their spray
foundation and it just feels really
greasy and heavy on my skin I don't get
the coverage out of it that I want
whenever I'm wearing it like I can feel
it on my skin just soaked wet greasy
heavy
it says definitely don't spray it oh
it's so fast right paint can to present
shade medium so let me just go ahead and
throw out the OL disclaimer if it works
for you and didn't work for me don't get
offended girl you know we all different
and different things work for different
people in different ways okay they're
going to spray oh there she goes I pat
it this isn't like the worst foundation
in the world it's like I hate the way it
feels on my skin and I also Lillian
stink so bad I forgot about that until
after applying it around my nose so I
feel like you like so wet greasy and
shiny and now like my pores that you can
barely see your glowing in light and
mind you have dry skin so I just not see
everything out of my ear good luck but
as you can see you can still see all my
sparkling and also it's not heavy
coverage for the amount of weight on the
foundation stinks so bad if I could
describe the smell what would I say
it smells chemically a little bit I will
show you that ships official sure I will
say the shade medium is quite popular
full this is a more py6
a hair do love doug gilded handle
brushes or some of my favorites from
morphe we launched a concealer this
palette I really didn't like from
L'Oreal what she looks like it is like
color correcting and that has a nice
little concealer on the end
I know honestly now yeah that's a
concealer to cover dark circles these
are very dry I'm not going to use the
sponge the sponge is terrible but I
would apply this on my finger anyways I
feel like these are a very drying
product and they creased under my eye
like nobody's business
like this palette I don't even know why
it has this concealer shade in it
because it's not universal many people
is just color going to work for two so
it with dark circles you know I guess
they're trying to make it like their
peach shade to rule out darkness but
it's not peach it's the color of a
concealer so I'm trying to do it justice
when I think about it on my girl now it
doesn't it just doesn't make sense like
do you see my under eyes how you can
still see that purple right there it
just really starts to
greased-up not the one it doesn't work
for me the other colors have the same
consistency yellow like the other ones
may work better for you because of the
color correcting you might be putting
the green on your cheeks to cool down
some redness so therefore it's not only
going to crease on your cheek but like
the under eye that's rough and then
there's no coverage so there's that next
product I didn't like which I've kind of
seen this floating around YouTube as
like a little failure of a product so it
got me scared to use it this is supposed
to be a setting powder but the product
just doesn't make sense because the
powder has color to it and so therefore
is like wines and they're like fifty of
these with a bunch of different shades
it's going to have color to it you know
is not just like a foundation powder
girl it's like pink right now so I'm
going to show you I mean like you can
see like I'm baking with it and it's
like even just setting you don't even
have to bake just have so much color to
it and it doesn't it doesn't look good
in general like it just doesn't look
good on my skin let's get close-up do
you see like the color to it you see
like in my nose and I'm rubbing you can
still see that color my nose yeah the
next is the brow product Mina didn't
work out this is the Loreal brow yeah
sorry I have powder in my nose and now
there's a Booker so there's a little
Loreal brow stylist and it's like this
fat marker looking thing and it has like
a fat kabuki brush to blend it out now I
could say this products potentially
being good for people who already have
thicker eyebrows and they just want to
touch you to upper still in a little bit
of a sparse area but for someone like me
who has thin brows in general like this
is absolutely not a good product however
it's very pigmented like you get a lot
of color out of it but that's so messy
in the fact that there's not even a
spoolie like you can't get precise with
your brows like this is how I fill my
brows to start sticking on them up at
the bottom and because the wand is so
fat it's crazy and now I came as fully
on my brow because it has like this
weird kabuki brush
which I guess is supposed to work well
with the product but your God so this
one I'm going to be a little more gentle
mind you I told you it's so pigmented oh
that's terrible and even if you had
thicker brows I guess like this would
just make them more of a mess on your
brows then what is worth I'm gonna have
to wipe some of this off of this girl
you love me looking graduate I don't
recommend it for anyone just being
honest like not to be a total butt-head
but I'll recommend it for anyone
Oh God Dorito next is a C on a solid
palette this is a light medium sheer
sculpting palette and these palettes are
these colors are Bray like they're
literally grey like what even it however
I try to contour my face because it's a
sculpting palette it's really meant for
carving out the cheekbones I'm
contouring and kind of like a dead
person is it bad that I don't want to
get it on one of my brushes I use every
day so I have to wash the brush all
right I'm gonna take my Marc Jacobs
brush I do love this brush um
you get like the dirt sides and I'm
getting it I have the same issue with
that Kevin of Quan powder this mate work
with a better skin tone but it just
gives me like this dirty sill and I show
you you can see I used to freaking
expensive AF brush that actually is one
of my favorite brushes two blenders
outlet and as you can see and you can
totally see patchiness this is an
absolutely no product for me I love I
love the heck out of in glory this is
really pretty
coloring but the actual product once I
got it on my skin it looks more powdery
than it did a highlighter read some
language I don't know if you can tell
like it just doesn't look like a
highlighter to me it looks like there's
like almost a white powder on my face is
something I would never do you see like
the white powder and like what I'm
saying like this is tripping me out
first of all girl get off once but I
mean it just doesn't give you like
necessarily a glow it just makes the
area look white okay and next up is for
eyes so I actually did a best Amar's
eyeshadow palette for I go through
palaces did more from iam Allison I am
loved to death so I'll link that video
down below for you guys to check out I
did ship away and donate all the pallets
that didn't work for me already so I
don't have them on deck but I do have
some eye products lid did not work out
so much that is these Estee Lauder these
are the fluid metals these are
eyeshadows and actually was jumping for
joy when I saw these because they look
come on camera don't play me
they look so look gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous and then I immediately pop them
out and I swatch on them on the back of
my hand almost like you see the
patchiness and inconsistency it's almost
like there's too much liquid in the
product and not enough actual glitter
and product you see what I mean like
they're just so watery instead of actual
give you that rich pigment and color
that you
you see in the tube and that you think
is going to be on your eyes let's put it
on and then just like tap it out get
that color going buzzes mm hmm
hi hello how are you
and even then like the darkness around
them that it gets patchy with someone
buying these you would get the initial
thought that that's going to be on your
eyelid and then this is what you get on
your eyelid is Italy there's too much
liquid in it and not enough actual
pigment a product that it's similar to
this that actually works out and you get
more of what you see in the packaging of
these news Feliz these are the
magnificence metals glitter and glow
like when I shadows I've been using
these non-stop like I've been glitter
eyes glitter eyes glitter eye at all the
events and going to because oh I can't
stop using these these are really good
oh I hit myself in the face next is for
mascara this is by eyeko and I really
cannot stand the brush on this it's
called the skinny mascara long and tall
it's just like a very strange brush and
I find that it's almost impossible to
grab your lashes with it my lashes are
permed upward so they stand up straight
no matter like what I'm doing in mind so
here's this I done it that brush did
nothing for my lashes this is one of my
favorites it's needed a big shot by
Maybelline or the velvet knee or by Marc
Jacobs plumps them on mind you my mirror
is like 50 light years away from me so I
can barely see like I'm just like the
ones of the ico mine are like I don't
know more uniform to put together and
look better than these over here and
these friends over here these a little
patchy chunky not a fan go ahead and do
lips for lips is the new Urban Decay
liquid lipsticks I'm not a huge fan but
in all honesty the shades that are matte
and not don't have any shimmer in it are
a little bit better
I don't hate those there are my favorite
liquid lipsticks ever but they're not
bad
the ones with shimmer in it are pretty
rough
the dark ones and shimmer in it are up
there inconsistent and they're super
pass genius to bazillion layers so
figure it out it takes the best one a
dark and shimmery color to show you what
I'm talking about
mind you well this look isn't that bad
with the eye color because you can even
see the eye color so that's like three
swatches on rubbing together okay do you
see this what the hell is up
it looks like I've had my lipstick on
for all day and now it's all pasty like
after I've eaten food and I just applied
it's only do a second layer so that's a
little better but to your card is still
freakin touchy so no only thing is I
have a primer or a blush that really
didn't work out for me
girls these are some products which I do
not recommend to you I feel like I
definitely have showed you what they
look like on the skin and why they don't
work really cruising that teeth I hope
you guys enjoyed the video you know I
guess is kind of me roasting makeup
product thank you guys so much for being
here watching you can subscribe to my
channel before you leave I love you guys
so much and I'll see you on the next
video I'm laughing because I'm like
seeing myself in the viewfinder on my Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
