video is going to be a tested out
hit-or-miss video and I'm testing out
these yellow highlighters
they're called heavens hue highlighter
with a nod to forget normal average
highlighter they have like they're putty
like they literally can do you see that
it's a putty why am I out of focus girls
this is my second video awesome today
so my camera is trying to act a little
crazy and isa straight now excuse me
ma'am well it was a picture anyways I
thought it would be interesting to do at
first impressions so sadly I wiped off
the highlighter I had on and like redid
my upper cheek makeup so I would be able
to test these out on a fresh face I
still have my nose highlight on to also
be highlighting the nose today
this pen to me and I was like what so
what what are these and I'm so excited
to share them with you guys cuz they're
a little weird and it's something a
little weird you know I'm gonna test it
out for you guys so I hope you're
excited to see this video also be didn't
see the video on this look well all my
nose itches I'll link it down below
I did like a person impressions video
and I use the new Carli bybel palette on
my eyes so without further ado and I'll
get off all these rabbit trails I keep
running on let's go ahead and jump right
in and get started
subscribe to my channel before you leave
forgot to say that
okay jumping in I have three of them I
think there are only three colors as a
bronze you want to get in which is one
of their best colors and transcendence
which is the holo color so let me show
you okay it's more of an iridescent not
really a holo color as now watch oh do
you see like the water that is that
water oh yeah it's like a liquid that
just poured out of it do you see how
it's just like you could like write your
name in it how strange I could just play
with this all day
it's I've never honestly dead serious
it's so different than the color pop
it's a lot different than the color pop
because I know those are a little putty
like it fills I've never felt anything
exactly like it kind of feel like it
just feels like putty
like if you were played with putty it's
what
it feels like so swatching it they are I
think because of the putty texture this
one it doesn't have a lot of
pigmentation do you see how it's kind of
like lightly frosted on my hand and I
don't really see the arid essence and I
see all my finger but not really on my
hand so let's watch the other ones and
see gather our thoughts okay so let's
try kitten I'm really excited about
Canon girl I work in um I bought the
single eye shadow like many moons ago
and I wore it on my eyelid like every
day for like a year so I'm very familiar
with this color so again let's just play
in it for the satisfaction of watching
me do it so interesting right huh okay
kind of satisfying just playing with it
so the kitten color with my finger it
actually has I think a bit more
pigmentation than the transcendence look
at that now that one is pretty yeah so
this one is more pigmented yeah I like
destroyed it I didn't really I mean it
just I could mold right back into what
it was it's just so much fun you know
okay let's move on kind of obsessed here
now the bronze one which is like a Goldy
bronze color it's so pretty let's just
watch this one and see what the business
is about who these could be a pretty eye
shadow it definitely shows up but if you
can see it's subtle like you put this
all over your cheek or body and like
have a beautiful bronze glow but you see
how it's somewhat soldal just kind of
subtle has that kind of golden highlight
to it so I'm excited to see how these
show up on the cheeks first we're going
to try kitten because it seems like that
one let's show the most because this
product is very dense a little fan brush
or a little fluffy brush isn't gonna I
just know it's like a wet product it's
not going to pick it up so I'm going to
use a little bit more of a dense brush
this is the white hint for morphe and
swirl it around to really pick up some
product oh yeah see that worked are you
ready kids
um wow that's freaking amazing
well that's pretty what do you guys
think
oh I did not see that coming
oh my god we bout to take this nose
highlight off right now
alright I have to try it on my nose my
nose looks shiny cuz the lighting but I
just took off my nose highlight oh I
just want to put it all over me oh okay
no highlight huh so this is everything
and more so and I love that I applied it
with this whiten brush because it was
like a mini kabuki where I was able is
more dense more able to grab the product
do you ever just fill a product here's
like oh I know what I need to do here
you can definitely apply it with your
fingers as well my finger was picking up
so much pigment next up is transcendence
I really want to try this one out and I
have another it's like a different shape
little dusty will cat hair never hurt
anything but this is CG at 34 brush and
I'm going to do the same business with
transcendence it looks like a lavender
powdery situation oh okay
the swatches on this pronto because
girl excuse me
why is this so pretty and you can
totally see the iridescent purple I'm
choked alright I was watching you
telling me I remember and now I'm like
oh okay
it's kind of everything girl okay this
makes my new favorite highlighter
alright now we have bronze I am going to
try a little bit of bronzer on my
forehead area because we got to you know
I was just going to try out to a home
well I'm not
left here shook screaming I'm looking
for another brush I know I got one in
here just going to find it cool we'll
just use this dirty brush I cannot find
a verse in my life it makes me so sad so
we're just going to put this little clue
key on it that's a lot of products I'm
scared of my room I make it let's see at
that golden hue it's like the same to it
I mean I shouldn't be putting this all
over my face like this please honey you
just watch mm-hmm so I wouldn't say this
one so much as broad so to say this is
just more golden because I see like more
of a golden hue out of it did not see it
being that intense what do you guys
think about this product leave a comment
down below and tell me your thoughts I
honestly had swatched these in the past
but it had probably been a month ago I
didn't recently get these and I had to
look up and see if they were still for
sale because they're not a brand-new
product but I just thought about was
that only a shoot I wanted to review
though so it's on an interview today
lamb if you had made so they're not a
super new product but like I said I
looked at made sure they were still for
sell what do you guys think about them
have any of you guys tried them what are
your thoughts it just looks so wet and
like beautiful on my skin because it's a
putty and not a powder so you don't even
have to like melt it down with a setting
spray because it's already melted down
for you and I think that's what I'm so
just like in all about because something
that I always do with my highlighters is
put a little bit of setting spray on top
level and like put a Beauty Blender on
them to make sure they're melted into my
skin so you don't have that ashy white
powdery look and it's more like a cool
Oh like a wet glow the you know how to
do that way because it's a putty this
product is genius and Dad cuz I've had
good luck with products lately my first
impressions video that I did
I'm so scary literally it's a Google
talking thing in my living room just
started talking to me it scares me I'm
home alone literally is there murderer
in my house right now because girl we
got to go hojae's Acela me Katie two
earrings off because one side the girl
is over prozis these are 100 larly
approved product I keep looking at my
highlights on success but I love you
