video is going to be a review video of a
foundation have to get it looks like
this I'm not wearing it right now so I'm
not spoiling you on the review it is by
y'all know I do not pronounce things
well and I assure you I'll be told a
million times in the comment section how
pronounce is brand Co Sunda Cassandra 22
I know I said that wrong anyways this is
a newer brand at Sephora and I recently
bought two their products and they have
this foundation putty it's so sure it is
so strange to texture enough you haven't
seen my highlighter putty reviews what
kind of child check it out I'll link it
down below but as for today we're going
to be reviewing that Foundation and
doing with a full purse impressions I
don't have my lashes on today so like a
bald eagle okay so let's get started by
wiping off my foundation that I have on
right now I'm just gonna take a little
mink boy okay here is my skin without my
foundation so first up let's read a
little bit about this foundation and see
what it's claims on like what the fuss
is about I actually haven't ever heard
of this branch playing off the floor and
I found it so I guess there's not really
a big fuss on it but I still want to
tell you guys a little bit about it so
you'll have a backstory to go off of
alright so the foundation by the way my
shade that I got this in is oh-three
natural to be honest this video was
filmed before my video went up it was
Jeffrey reviewing their hidden
foundation and I had no idea what kind
of shade dilemma I was about to be in so
that's why I'm acting clueless in this
video because I was clueless but since
then I've known that this Bryn is a
Korean brand and that's why the shades
are so light I still disagree with the
arrangement of shapes that they have but
do what you want
I put the information out there and
spend your money how you want to and the
foundation is closed bounce up powder
packs powder foundation what is it a
long-lasting unique powder foundation
with a bouncy formula that leaves the
skin with a velvety finish I thought
this is one that could creamy it doesn't
feel like powder and I'll show you in a
second why I said that there's only four
shades in it
once it's applied the foundation spell
see high coverage formula softly melts
into the skin and does not but smudge
it's not sticky and long-lasting it
smoothly delivers coverage and in part a
delicate velvet velvety radiance oh I
cannot read these words today just apply
you can build it up to you apply it all
over and you can also apply it to build
it up like ply it a little more so it
comes to this compact with a little
sponge right here and then it comes with
this little clear topper which I like so
your sponge doesn't sit in your compact
now let me show you do you see my
fingerprint have you ever seen a powder
or you can get your fingerprint in there
no ah it's like a cream it honestly it's
a weird texture it's just different from
things that I've seen before and that's
what our to me to give it a try
so do you see what I'm saying
like that's not powder and it feels like
super wet too like the filling of it
then you can like mold it right back to
how it was just like it reminds me of
this still a putty but softer maybe even
a little more wet per se sealing and
then it does feel like slick silk velvet
if I had to describe it to you it smells
like Meryl Norman I don't know if you
guys remember that makeup Brandy's be
more popular but yeah it kind of like
Marilyn so first what I want to do is
pry my skin today I'm just going to use
a little bit of the Urban Decay b6
spritz like a nice vitamin spray for the
skin I'm going to smack myself in the
face to wake me up a little bit and now
I guess I'm going to start applying it
to my face I'm going to use this sponge
to do it with because it comes with
sponge so obviously that's like a
suggestion there let me put my computer
down I love it get all up in here I
think to just yeah I'm missing a nail I
mean you clocked me now you see it honey
so oh it's so strange like look at that
like oh I got some on here honestly it
looks kind of like we're kind of
grossing me out so I'm just interesting
if you can see it's not like soft it's
like
not like a most material of island
mirror okay why is this color way
lighter than what's in the actual
component here and I feel like this
shade just went so light on me and do
you see how this lunch isn't as Orbach
that has like a weird layer over the
padding it kinda noise me when
foundations like look how light that is
about my nose this is not my color but
it's definitely my color in the compact
it annoys me whenever foundations do
this today now I gotta wear this all day
and it's way too light great fabulous
this is like really light though this is
like turning ghostly what is going on
it's like oxidizing you guys think its
oxidizing like having a reaction because
this is like freaking me out a little
bit oh great
I don't get it guys why is it doing this
I feel like the more I rub it in so why
look at that the whiter it gets right in
the tarnation gap I just cannot do it
and I deal with this oh my god no it's
gonna look rough on my forehead I'm
screaming and then sign right there you
know my ovens behind oh yes I mean I'll
just wear this all day and I have a
super white base it is turning like
sheet of paper white do you see how like
that and this is different color I'm
screaming it's like turning into chalk
I'm looking at my viewfinder I
understand what's happening this is a
hot mess right now it's definitely
oxidizing as sunscreen in if you guys
are wondering I mean I'm just trying to
read on it like where was the warning
for this so this is a great review so
it's hard to still on my face it does
feel very dry it still due to like the
dry skin right here because it's like
powdery it's kind of having a little
moment right here with a dry skin which
doesn't want that great feel like the
longer I'm wearing
is getting lighter because there's only
four shades like if you did one try this
I would be like extremely careful when
trying this product out it's not that
cheap this product is $36 so here's the
kicker of it all
I got one of the darker shades that's
the part that you're going to scream
this is natural Oh three their lightest
shade is porcelain ivory natural which
is the one I got which is from median
skin tones with a yellow undertone are
you kidding me and then their darkest
shade is medium deep the color sand so I
got the second from the darkest color
they have and this is it as far as like
the fill of the actual foundation yes it
feels good I think it does have nice
coverage because my freckles are barely
appearing through which you can still
kind of see them so it's not a cool full
coverage it's like medium to maybe full
coverage if they actually had good
shades I think that this will be a cool
product if you were like a super full
coverage girl and want to apply this on
top of your foundation foundation line
much it's supposed to hydrate the skin
it doesn't really feel hydrating it kind
of feels dry on my skin this how I'm
feeling about this honestly I was gonna
do a wear test with this I'm debating on
doing it because it's like I feel like
it's pointless it's going to look crazy
right now and like I can't go out in
public so I'll do a couple hours weird
test like a four hour wear test and then
I can't go out in public with this so
I'll have to take it off what if I were
to buy multiple shades in this
foundation I would have went up I would
about this darker one and then I went to
one up and bought a lighter one so it
still wouldn't have worked out because I
wouldn't have bought the darkest shade
for me I'm going to throw those out
there my pores look huge right here and
honestly just you know between me and
you I don't have really large pores on
my face and it's not something I'm
battle on the regular so and lately I've
been using this as my primer and it's
been just fine with all foundations but
I think we both can see how magnified
these pores are and I think it's because
the product is such a matte finish on it
so as of right now I absolutely it was
my color I would wear this part again
probably because especially a loan I
wouldn't wear it because it just very
drying it said my dry spots and I saw
that my pores are magnified don't know
how it's gonna wear so let's find out
how it's going to wear you know let me
do it check in I think it'll be cool if
I do it like it check in on my iPhone
and see how it's going to wear in like
four hours to like a happy day but then
I have to leave my house I'm like crazy
looking right now so we'll do a four
hour check in and I'll let you know how
it way her I'm wearing the foundation
for about four hours and you can see
like the color of my eyelids are so much
darker than the foundation it also all
creased up in my smile line which sucks
so doesn't it settles in the lines a
little bit my pores it may be hard to
see cuz it's kind of bright right here
my pores are still kind of crazy I will
say it hasn't like slept off my skin so
I do think it's long last things at the
same time if you deal with small lines
or fine wrinkles it does so into that
the shades are just a complete and total
bust it does not do anything great for
the poor area and overall I don't
recommend it I think it's a myth anyways
I really want to go wash my face now so
that's a rat we did it it wasn't great I
love you guys don't forget to subscribe
to my channel before you leave and I'll
see you all next video okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
