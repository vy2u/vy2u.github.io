just moved these funny meaty rooms
that's not really my beauty room either
yes I yours
I just think one airing now you can't
recall with me our channel is young lot
of Polish and we filmed to get ready
with me go check that video out I'm sure
it'll be up yeah yeah so go check out
that video because we did this what if I
just saw here like though I could just
be laid out like a Queen of Sheba oh
yeah we're doing a haul video we went to
Fame and we got lots of goodies and
stuff like that I want to share it with
you guys you know so me it's borrowed it
got a pretty random stuff first I got I
didn't even see what you got I'm excited
bobby was on battle ash wear socks box
it's really good soft spots palette
that's kind of hard to say for me that's
good though
what's this one called cuz there was two
it's just the battle ash is the battle
ash oh this one has look how big the
colors are it was $60 ever try oh yeah I
have it
I've never tried it don't know anything
about it just saw it and I wanted it so
I didn't get much of fame other than
like the fries but we're gonna be right
I mean to get honest I didn't really
have much we didn't have much in the
shop like we were walking around talking
to people so I got a couple brushes from
morphe I just picked up more of my
favorites so I got the g2 which of them
I get it I know my favorite under I like
concealer
blending brush then I got the e36 it's a
tiny little pencil brush but it is the
best pencil brush and then I got the
m4a3 9 which is my favorite foundation
brush like it's really good I mean you
try that it's really good then I got a
see palette oh I might
I learned that friend I have like look
computer can we crack it up a bus that
bad boy this door I just died
look at that oh my gosh it is already
now I understand they have their I think
that was 17 bucks that are not bad you
know in a double-ended know this is a
single one so I don't really get it fame
but I want to show it because I think it
has a good meaning behind it so this is
from lush this is a campaign that we're
doing right now it's gay is okay
doesn't it's not so good like pure
heaven the bar of soap is only like five
dollars
it smells like lemon like scent that
lasts forever
yeah I'm not gonna use it I'm just going
to keep it out but I think the message
behind it is really good because my I
feel like most brands shy away from
anything to do with like gay or lesbian
issues they're like oh no that's a girl
yeah pretty much so I like that they're
doing this and they're donating a
hundred percent of persons they aren't
they dress for priority so I think it's
really good just wanted to mention it I
really want to use it maybe I'll get
another one for my bod yeah we're going
shopping
yeah I got a pretty cool products that
was walking past this dude and I like
once every two interrupts to let you
know what is that I'll take thirty
literally that was our conversation so
this please press on now so cute oh your
nose with ten bucks you're supposed to
be able to reuse them and it comes with
glue in the package and they look like
you got your nails are freshly good
you're gonna die whenever you see these
oh my goodness they're so cute they are
so cute look or so deal yeah yeah give
me these just wait like a rhinestone
nail everybody had these static nail
bags I even asked I was like wait
everybody buying from static nails and
it was these little guy got hurt with me
either I don't even know what website to
get on froms crazy so right here so it's
static mill sucked oh yeah we got a
bunch of stuff from Vera Mona you guys
probably know them as the people who do
the color switch I feel like this has
gotten more popular on YouTube recently
and I never had one so when we met her I
was like good like she gave us all this
stuff and I was like could I please have
one of the original is this matter 2000
it's like this little what would you
even call it like an abrasive little
sponge and you're supposed to take your
makeup brush and you know just run it
along and it's supposed to get all of
the eyeshadow off so you can go into
another color without having to like
spot clean apparently it's amazing then
they also gave us this is suitable the
color switch Vita this is one of their
new products and it's this is cool I
think I really like this you know more
me too it's just like a matte that you
put down on your people and you just you
know if you're a makeup artist
oh yeah definitely change your world and
you can just like wash it I guess
thanks you say you can throw it in the
washer really and then the last thing I
this possibly could be my favorite see
how this are like it's sturdy yeah and
it's it has purple in it which was my
favorite color so that makes me excited
but it's an eyeshadow palette with a
double sided brush and then you get the
color switch awesome I know they're so
great it's like well made let's watch
them become oh wow be really nice
because this color oh yeah that's
hydrangea that's exciting and she was
really sweet the owner
she was so strong he was not only put it
in the Navy foods at look at Beauty
event because they always have the pro
discount back there so I got two
lipsticks reduced colors I love disco

Cory thank you thank you
so the first one I got is a love potion
and it it's beautiful that is so pretty
like sweating because I've been to my
car and it's not in here oh this is
gorgeous
oh my gosh that's so you yeah yeah oh
yeah yeah we love color this one's
called karma and hers are not drawing
whatever no they're really good makings
and look how nice the packaging is yeah
like you can just tell when you do this
like when you roll the lipstick up it's
so smooth it's like Genki yeah they're
just very well me yeah I loved oh she
loved it and she's a sweetheart she is a
daughter Instagram is mom yeah
hacklin actually we were just kind of
walking by and they kind of stalked us
and gave us this enormous bag of just
product I just like we have the greatest
job in the world are so lucky
yep so Laura already unboxed her so I'm
just going to use these guys so they
gave us the purifying foam cleanser you
said you use this brand before yes but I
haven't used the cleansers I've used the
tone urban sensors what the packaging is
really nice it's so nice I think they're
sold at Sephora oh yeah it smells kind
of manly and I like it Oh Oh feel that
what is that the micro dermabrasion is
great man in the world it feels really
nice no it doesn't snow well oh oh it
does not it doesn't smell good
oh girl you
I love toners the clarifying toner
she told me this makes for a really good
setting spray oh really
right yeah I like and look at that
bottle someone breaks into your hammer
good feel get your shoulder exactly
whoops somebody with that that's heavy
like it's serious packing thank knowing
you guys coach yes they go all out on
packaging I can't believe that I know I
feel like this is a brand that not many
people know anything about like people
that I was with then are like hardcore
beauty bloggers I'm not going to drop
names because then people are like oh my
God look at this bitch name dropping
people that are really big in youtube
have no idea what this brand is so
Kaplan you guys need to get it out there
these you can help me look at you down
there lip glosses and they come with
like little mirrors on the top oh they
do
again just well-made package a memory
now yeah a lot of them are kind of
shimmery so maybe if you're not into
shimmers you might not like it you
probably won't
honestly like these if you're not into
like glitter or shimmery stuff because
just about all of them
do you have some of that in it I will
say they do have I think they have you
have SPF 20 in it so it'll protect your
lips outside they feel really soft
though and not goopy you know oh and
these moments oh yeah that's nice so
we'll keep you guys posted
look I'm just I'm talking you know she
ain't gonna let you know so come over

their lip liners lip 20 liner definition

perfect travel palette absolutely and
you know that like how good their colors

that the owner of the rocks name is
