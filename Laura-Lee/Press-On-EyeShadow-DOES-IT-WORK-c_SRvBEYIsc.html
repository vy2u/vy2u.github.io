hmm
guys welcome to my channel this is the
Laura Lee channel in case you didn't
know that I feel like I start
introducing myself tune in the new peeps
that come to my channel anywho today's
video is going to be on stick on
eyeshadow I don't really know these
products a whole the hell drama I'm
gonna be reviewing this product and
testing it out in this video it's gonna
be one of my tips to develop videos I
don't know why my dad boys I thought it
would be cool it wasn't cool was it okay
I'm really excited to try it out I
actually got in a couple of different
colors because and it came with like 20
sheets I didn't know their Tris is like
it on your eye and you have this
beautiful I show on your eye I don't I'm
skeptical I'm skeptical if it's gonna
work
but anyways we're gonna do we're gonna
jump right in and get started be sure
and subscribe to my channel before you
leave and Liz Zoe don't girl honey this
is my drink first
alright now we're gonna get started I
bought two boxes of this is color on
professional and it is she's just placed
on your eyes smooth it on pill it off
blend it out a little bit it looks like
with your finger and then set it I don't
know guys I'm gonna have to take a break
and read the instructions although I
really don't want to if I hate reading
instructions I hate it I'm also gonna
take off what a little bit of eye shadow
have on as well as my lashes so we can
do this thing oak I actually got these
makeup wipes from the hundred points
perks at Sephora cafe my Dallas okay I
managed to take off most of my eye
makeup without removing my eyebrows
while they're still there for the most
part so whenever you pull them out of
the package you get this weird thing in
a little brush and then like 150 sheets
I'm just kidding I don't really know how
many sheets are in here but it looks
like 150 oh actually it says forks out
on my easel I'm reading everywhere on
this box and it does not say if you
should use an eye primer or not but it
does say you should set it with a powder
that comes with it whenever you're
completely finished I really want to try
out these purpley Brown ones first
because they're the most cocoa and I
think they're going to show up the best
so I peeled off the top layer of the
paper and it took off like a layer of
the eyeshadow I hope that's normal it's
probably not are you still wearing my
underwear um one I don't think my eyelid
is this big and it doesn't say anywhere
on here you should cut it so I don't
know we're just gonna do it all right
here I go all right so I have it on my
eye right now I feel like I'm pressing
my eye really hard which is completely
unnecessary so I'm just gonna rub it oh
it kind of sticks it's like sticky so it
doesn't slough around so I'm just
rubbing my eye just rubbing it place
smooth and peel are the instructions so
that happened I know it doesn't look
good but it's not as bad as I thought it
was gonna be so then it says to blend it
so you're supposed to take your finger
and just softly blend it out I
definitely don't think my fingers gonna
do anything to help this situation now
so I'm gonna get a makeup brush and I'm
really softly I would definitely say you
don't need the eyeshadow primer to do
this oh my gosh this stuff is thick
y'all ahh so this is like a cream
product yeah this is definitely a cream
it looks like a powder but that's why
you set it with a powder because like
it's such you can see it shiny like it's
a cream I would even buff that out a
little bit all right so it's a little
too big for my eyeball I'm gonna go
ahead and set it and then this is the
little translucent powder which I get
why you set it because it is so creamy
this stuff would be all over if you like
opened your eyeball fully like it would
transfer now that happened I feel like I
have a better state of mind of like what
this product is and how it works so I
can possibly do the other one even
better we'll see what happens here we go
so it comes on the cardboard strip and
you just take off the top layer which
you kind of look like watch it kind of
looks like you're peeling the whole
eyeshadow off but you definitely are not
okay well we just pulled the whole eye
shadow off we're gonna make this one
good guys I can fill it oh I dropped it
I'll shoot all right so I'm not gonna
press as hard because I thought
was like a powder you had a press onto
your eyelid I'm gonna take it a lot
easier oh it's sticking to my hand oh
you see how like gentle you do not for
real have to press these you just go
like this and it's on there alright
ready guys tada
that's kind of pretty now I'm going to
take a clean blending brush and I mean I
don't know why I said that's kind of
pretty that's not pretty I just lied to
you
and then I must smooth the cream product
out okay but see that's not like the end
of the world I mean this harsh line
right here it's got to go it's got to
find a new home but I'm actually gonna
take a bigger brush to try to soften up
that harsh edge oh my god okay you
cannot tell me that that looks horrible
that does not look horrible you know I'm
saying like and then set it with the
powder all right I'm not gonna lie to
you in the beginning of this I was a
hundred and ten percent and full doubt
because I knew it would turn out like
this but now that I know like how to be
so gentle with it and just to softly
blend it out these actually aren't that
bad and seriously if you um have really
a lot of trouble or you're not into
eyeshadow me you want to have a nice
look every now and again but you don't
have a lot of time to get ready this
this is not a bad option look at that oh
let me know what you guys think down in
the comments obviously don't let me know
what you think about this eye because I
don't care what you think about this eye
it's pretty this is like someone found
my eye not gonna lie I had fun doing
this thanks for watching I love you guys
and I'll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
