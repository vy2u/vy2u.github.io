video is going to be products that did
not work for me I don't do these videos
often because I never want to step on
people's toes because I know that if a
product's like a holy girl to me or I'm
just obsessed with it and I see someone
knock it I'm like hold on now I know the
feeling
so I just want to say in this video
that's my disclaimer not necessarily
knocking this front knocking these
products they just didn't work out for
me and just understand that doesn't mean
that they're not gonna work out for you
I'm just gonna explain why they didn't
work for me personally me so that is not
the way I feel like we can jump into
this video and get started and talk
about to make up so Lego pumpkin spiced
cheesecake burn me behind me why yes it
is and yes it smells heavenly first it's
this Saint repairs
perfect legs spray this stuff is a
little bit pricey I picked it up on
vacation because I forgot my self-tanner
and I thought I would just grab a little
spritzer self-tanner however it is
extremely spotty and whenever I rubbed
it in my legs
it just it was so light that you
couldn't even tell that I use tanner and
then the places that I sprayed are like
spritz to cross it didn't work for me it
just it was still splotchy I couldn't
get it to even out and not only that it
just I think there wasn't much of a tan
so I liked there a gel and there foam
but the spray is not for me nice product
is the Maybelline clean Express makeup
remover gel hold the phone because I
know a lot of people love this but it's
not actually a bad product I just want
to say that the gel does not work half
as well as the actual liquid the liquid
suede oil layer and it's a little bit
more messy but it gets the makeup off so
much faster and works so much better
than the gel so I don't recommend the
gel I used to love this stuff until I
tried out the Maybelline liquid one and
I was like next I'll mention to you guys
a hair spray they didn't work for me so
with my curls very I've to use
particular hair sprays because some just
they crunch them just say so this one is
the volume finish it's the third max I'm
hold so it's a pretty strong hold one
but really instead of creating a whole
for my curls it just made them hard as a
brick and then they just look like
crunchy poo so I definitely wouldn't
repurchase this I like Ozzy shampoo and
stuff but this was not a friend of mine
want to talk about one product on
Tyler's behalf this is the Hans defunk
oh I don't know quicksand this is a hair
gel or like I had texturizing stuff so
he uses a texturizer in his hair you
just use it on dry hair to give it like
a beachy texture or like dry shampoo he
uses it just to get the front of his
hair some volume and body and he came
home from work and I was like oh last
time you washed your hair and he was
like I know I know I ordered this on
Amazon experimenting and it was a sell
hair looked honestly it looked very
gross it felt grainy it felt greasy like
he hadn't washed it and it did nothing
to hold his hair so I don't recommend
this whatsoever for anyone to another
product that didn't work for me is this
Sally Hansen's ouch relief strips hard
wax kit it comes with this awesome wax
foot cup but had an accident in the
microwave with it because I am a DD and
I never pay attention
it was just like boiling over not why I
don't like it the product is out list so
it's like it doesn't peel off like it
feels gooey it never fully dries is what
I experienced it just I used their other
one that's like a yellow wax and it
works so good but I pulled this off it
didn't take out any of my eyebrows
because it was too soft
I waited forever for it to dry it just
wouldn't dry I guess that's the part and
they out slips where it's not suss to be
so harsh on your skin but I mean it
didn't pull out my hairs and it left a
mess on my face not cool very
disappointing to me cuz I was excited to
get the hairs pulled out pain free from
wax but as I suspected it didn't pull
out the hair so right along into some
makeup products the first is the it by
by under eyes I hear this product being
raved about all the time and that's okay
because you know what it is an amazing
concealer and it will
until your bags for days it will flash
back on you with a camera like nobody's
business
so I will never wear this product out
and typically if I do a makeup look I
take a picture with a flash for the
thumbnail or for Instagram and it just
flashes back and leaves your under eyes
looking ghost white and scary that is
why this probably didn't work for me
does its job and the bye-bye under-eye
as far as getting the dark away next is
two lip glosses or really the Milani
this is their brilliant shine lip gloss
it's just a preference thing it just
didn't work for me because it had too
much like glitter in it it was just like
oh disco ball lips
not for me that's why I didn't like
these again that was that's total
preference they felt grainy and weird on
my lips and it was just like so much
thick glitter I was just like I'm gonna
wear these again so I don't know this is
the Rimmel scandaleyes eyeliner I find
the ones a little awkward shape which is
a little bit hard to control to get your
liner down and to it dry shiny
that's preference I like my eyeliners to
be black and matte this one was all
shiny and it looked like it was wet all
the time and I was just like oh no
goodbye like this a Mac fluidline which
let me just start off saying they're
black fluid lines are one of the
greatest creation and gel liner ever but
the ones with color I've never ran into
one of the fluid lines that are colored
it actually works there's way too thin
of a product and the only thing I see
them good for using is an eyeshadow base
so if I wanted to do like a navy blue
lid I would put this down as a base but
actually using it what it's for a gel
liner it's horrible the problem is it
goes on so thin it's like the color
doesn't actually show up so I never I'm
gonna say I don't recommend buying these
in color form I only recommend buying
the I think it's called black track the
black one I love the black one but the
color ones are just done now this NYX
palette I like the colors in the palette
it's a good in theory but they are just
chalky and dry and so they they swatch
well whenever you actually oh wow
look there's a merit in there they feel
so soft and creamy whenever you go to
dip your brush in there to actually
apply to your lid they don't blend out
well because they're so dry and dusty so
I don't recommend spending your money on
this one
there's a load of amazing Knicks poets
out there that works so much better than
this this one's just a note for me from
NYX and I love NYX eyeshadows especially
there's single eyeshadows they have
amazing quality but this one no one more
product from NYX and when I talked to
you guys about is their liners so just
their plain penciled liners they are
they they're not creamy whatsoever they
don't come off you have to like dig it
onto your skin to get it to come off
darn sure wouldn't work in the waterline
like nothing would come off but even
it's watching it on your hand pressing
down that hard it's still patchy and it
just is gooey and dry feeling rather
than that creamy fill that you
typically filled with swatching a liner
so these were disappointing um didn't
work out how I wanted it to so I
wouldn't recommend next I wanna talk
about the Revlon bold
lacquer mascara um I think you're much
too much about this in the beauty world
but I just want to say on my part it did
nothing for my lashes honestly it just
didn't work for me it's supposed to be a
lengthening mascara and I just didn't
notice that at all
I wouldn't repurchase it nice product I
want to talk about is the bare minerals
bare skin foundation my skin just felt
so extra greasy whenever I use this um I
do have a great forehead area the rest
of my face is pretty much dry so I guess
you guess they have combination skin but
my forehead was just so extra greasy
with this I felt like it just slept off
so quickly so this is definitely
foundation that I do not reach for
because of that okay that's all thank
you guys so much for being here I love
you guys to death I really appreciate
