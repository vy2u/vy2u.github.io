little bit different because I got some
friends and Bob this is my friend
Kristin hey guys I'm Christian domine
I'm a friend Patrick hey Patrick stop 3
R's today we're going to be filming prom
makeup tutorials well on this channel
it's just my pro make a tutorial but
check out Kristin's prom makeup tutorial
and Patricks prom make it the story Joe
had their videos linked down below be
sure to subscribe to the channels as
well and um yes be sure to enjoy my
video and subscribe to me if you haven't
already lots of good things happening on
this channel and you don't want to miss
out so we're gonna jump right in the
video lighting start it with our prom
face we're going to start by giving our
skin some hydration with the Milani
hydrating facial primer and then we'll
move on to a little bit of foundation
I'll be using the flower foundation I
got this at Walmart and when I started
using it I was like oh my goodness does
it do dark but you know what I blended
it out and it worked out just fine
so a couple products in this tutorial
isn't affordable and most of them are
but I just took your feedback from last
year and I did an all drugstore one last
year and people requested that I mix
drugstore with high-end because not all
of you are using all drugstore so just
know your feedback is always listened to
and I appreciate it so but most of it is
affordable in this tutorial moving on
we're gonna go in with a bare skin
concealer the reason I went with the
concealer Anna but your skin is because
it lasts long I love this concealer for
not creasing and just lasting a long
time so I'm going to go ahead and
highlight my face with it and then I'll
blend that out with my little stippling
brush I mentioned this in my favorites
video because I love this brush so much
much so much my cat is trying to get in
the mini blinds so I hope you guys can't
hear that I'm going to set my face with
this loose powder from laura mercier NYC
makes a good one that I found at the
drugstore so if you want to use that
instead I did go a little crazy with the
setting powder but hon man my makeup is
not going to go anywhere when you set
your makeup it's gonna last and it's
also gonna look amazing in those prom
pictures and I know you'll be taking
next up I'm going with my current
favorite bronzer from the drugstore is
the butter bronzer by Physicians Formula
I am NOT obsessed with the smell as most
people are it just is really strong
smelling but it has such a nice color to
it where it's not too orange and it
actually lasts for a long time so I have
been loving this DUP contour out those
cheekbones
I'm going to contour my nose around the
forehead just the usual
areas you guys know the drill yes honey
we see your cheekbones you can stop now
okay moving on I'm going in with a core
Lisa blush by Milani it has a little bit
of a sparkle to it but I thought that
would be really pretty on prom and I
don't currently have an obsession
highlighter from the drugstore so I just
use this one by Make Up For Ever and the
pro sculpting palette number two it's
just a gold highlighter and I dust it on
the high cheekbones Cupid's bow and down
the nose now for the eyes the first year
I went in from The Naked 3 palette by
urban decay
it's just that light palette and I just
blend that in the crease of my
transition shade I do have an eye primer
on it's the Mac pink bottom Pro Pro
Longwear Paint Pot in soft ochre but
yeah this step can totally be skipped
this is just a little bit of a deeper
pink color and honestly I didn't make
any bit of a difference so if you wanna
skip the step by all means please do I
thought it was just gonna make it all
gradient and cool but nothing happened
so next up with this wet and wild
palette I decided to pick this pink
shimmery color on my lid the fallout was
real I mean you can see it's like
dusting everywhere I swear goodness so I
ended up adding this color on top of it
and wetting the color a little bit
trying to get it to stick a little bit
better and kind of worked out now I'm
going in with a little bit of a deeper
purpley gray color in the power
and blending that in the crease I really
wanted to deepen up my crease so yeah I
mainly focus on the outer corner next up
I went in with his darker shades because
I was like it's just that dark enough
from the Urban Decay palette and blend
it right on top of that gray color in
the outer corner and kind of blend it on
and word whatever's left on my brush you
just wanna make sure you have a really
light hand when using these dark colors
peeps don't go crazy with it you will
have four regrets if you go crazy with
it so going back in with that sparkling
color I'm having fallout again but I
thought a really cool thing to do would
be to wet it and press it into the upper
lid that way when the eyes are open you
have like a lot of sparkle shining
through your lashes and it turned out
really cool I love the way this turned
out so using the wet and wild brush I
just sprinkled that in the inner corner
and above my crease going in with some
wet and wild black gel liner and I'm not
winging it out and I'll show you why and
then you can just use your favorite
mascara to build up those lashes if you
don't want to add false lashes that's
fine and dandy you can wing it out or do
your liner however but I'm going to and
the band on these lashes from Lila Lilly
lashes were so thick it was important
for me to line my lashes all one looking
crosser I just went back in I think this
show is called a nooner from the Urban
Decay palette and sprinkled it across my
lower lash line I ended up bringing it
on down pretty far because I wanted it
to be super smoky so then that brought
us to the next color which was that dark
blackish purple color and we're going to
smooth that out smooth it out blend it
out really close to the lash line I'm
going in with this Physicians Formula
Argan eyeliner and I'm going to blend
this all over my waterline I'm even
gonna drag it down the in between my
lashes y'all I was not playing games
today okay we're gonna smoke her out and
I went ahead in top line this is looks
like I'm stabbing myself in that eye I'm
not then I'm gonna coat the lashes of
course what's some mascara this is one
by Milani it's called renin one my
lashes you can just use whichever is
your favorite next up I'm going with n
with this awesome lip liner brush and
OnPoint by Too Faced I will list a
cheaper similar option in the
description box as well as everything
that I used and lastly we're going to
set our face of course you don't know
what your makeup running away okay so
just go ahead spritz bit spritz and
you're done I hope you guys enjoy thank
