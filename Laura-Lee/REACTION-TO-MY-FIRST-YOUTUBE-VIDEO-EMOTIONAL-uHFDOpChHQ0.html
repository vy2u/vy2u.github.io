video is definitely going to be a
different video it is one of you me
reacting to my very first video that I
put on YouTube which is gonna be taking
me back a bit it's a very cringe when a
video um I was living in Alabama at the
time and I was living my life doing my
thing working full-time going to school
and I decided to take a whim and give
you two a try so yeah I look a little
bit different now and I've had lip
fillers I've had my teeth Invisalign
here's my visit line right here actually
I'm not finished with that hair is
different my brows are thicker yeah so
this video is going to be interesting
before we jump into the video I'm just
going to know it's really quick that
I've been giving away a MacBook Pro want
you to do is subscribe to my channel and
you are entered if you're already
subscribed you're already entered and
you can get an additional entry by
following me on Instagram and this is
January the 15th we're gonna go ahead
and jump right in and get started so if
you don't know who I am I'm Laura and I
live in California Los Angeles to be
exact and this video takes place in
Montgomery Alabama where I'm from and I
was 24 years old maybe 23 this video is
almost 4 years old will be 4 years old
and March music the eyebrows guys the
eyebrows and this was me plucking them
off so the video is on contour and
highlighting which is a very difficult
video to make your first video hey guys
Laura here and today I'm going to show
you the perfect and very easy way to
contour and highlight your face right
now all i have on it's just my
foundation this video is kind of painful
for me to watch because my country
accent is thick huh what samudaya
alabama i did lose a good bit of my
country accent believe it or not i kinda
sorta have no idea what i'm talking
about in this video but i thought i did
just to be fair i wasn't just blowing
smoke up your hat i I thought I knew
like a pro way to contour and highlight
your face and that's why I'm making the
video it
is troublin by covergirl and it looks
like this my favorite the color I use is
4 4 5 Sun mascara which is xx
L Pro by Maybelline the first things
first
umm I'm specialist specialist under my
eyes which I'm just I'm literally scared
shitless no one really knew I was
starting my channel I don't think other
than my sister and I was scared to death
I was like shaking trembling my voice
and I'm a little bit like this under
each eye then I'm going to go ahead and
conceal down the nose and a little bit
up here in between the eyebrow area and
to rub that in I'm going to be using a
brush by Mac which is the 190 brush a
good Duke for that it's just the regular
elf it's already cooking you guys oppa
dude already giving you guys dude it's
just my destiny just a little background
on Who I am and this I worked full-time
at a dermatologists I was going to
school during the day too and neither of
those things really made me happy per se
and I was scared to death that I would
be working at that dermatologists
forever because it was a good job and
and not I didn't want the degree that I
was getting it was marketing I was like
what am I gonna do I don't want a
marketing degree like that doesn't make
me happy but I'm working and spending
all this money on school to get a degree
just because Society says I need to go
to college and I don't know I was just
really really lost and it pushed me into
a corner and I got scared and the way I
let that out is by starting a YouTube
channel and I was scared to death
putting myself out there on the Internet
is like embarrassing but I just had to
like get some balls and put myself out
there and that's what I did with this
first video was talking because I
thought the sound on the camera works
founded at work so it is a voiceover
next time I want to pee my shirt guys I
was using this sunlight for my window
and I'll put it right over here which
camera I was using you well you guys it
was real and Mac Blunt is a great
contouring project so it's going to use
the color that is a matte orange
chocolatey - dimmer no red undertones to
make sure that your look is very natural
I can barely hear myself oh so Wow my
first time editing a video - and I
didn't even have a computer I would
drive to my mom's tells it and bar her
Dell computer and use Windows Movie
Maker
the music's finally coming down myself
box babe I am totally not being myself
in this video which obviously it's
really difficult turning on a camera and
just talking to it and being 100%
yourself it's really hard and it took me
quite a few videos to get used to be
myself and like I said in the past
whenever I started my channel I thought
I had to be like other people and at
like them on their channels in order to
have a successful YouTube channel and
that's not only oh I'm scared shitless
here but I'm also trying to be really
professional and mature and perfect at
what I'm doing and just not me at all
obviously it's my first video so you
know cutting myself a break but that is
what's going on here
um but outside of this video I would say
I am the same person that I am today
I'm very porky goopy person I obviously
am not sure how to teach makeup yet or
talk about makeup yet because I'm all
over the place I am very unconfident in
this video I can definitely tell that
one talking to the camera for the first
time can totally throw you off and - I
think I'm I was in confident and
everything I was doing in my life I
wasn't that confident my job I darn sure
wasn't confident at school I wasn't
getting along with the people I lived
with and
and you know I didn't have a lot of
friends at the time my sister was one of
my only friends at the time and it kind
of makes me sad in a weird way watching
this video because I know that I
definitely wasn't happy at this time of
my life just a lost and confused
after I upload this first video to
YouTube was like I was addicted I was
like three or four comments and people
they wanted to talk to me and it was
like a connection with someone else I
was really looking for friends in a
connection and I really found that
through YouTube um this is my first
youtube video that I've done so far
I hope really hope you guys liked it um
I want you guys to please comment below
and give me more ideas for more videos
to add I do leave it up on YouTube
because I want people to be able to go
back to my channel and see the video and
see where I started and know that
wherever you start hard work and you can
get there I say some of them a bit
different than Who I am today I feel
like I Know Who I am a little more I and
I damn sure know what I want I just you
know tried something new and on a whim
and it really became something that I
wanted to do and I continuously uploaded
and uploaded and uploaded videos a lot
of those videos aren't up anymore but I
always keep my first video up that way
people can see it I never ever go back
and watch this video like ever so I knew
making this video it's gonna be a little
bit painful it's why I have a little
frog in my throat because I want to cry
looking at her I just wish I could go
give her a hug no she's gonna make
tell her that so many big big big things
are gonna come from you getting the
balls to make this little video right
here on you too and keep going with it I
wish I could just go tell me that cuz I
know how unhappy I was you know right
here and how many friends I didn't have
and now I have so many of the bestest
friends you know that cares so much
about me and I'm so happy with what I do
and how it turned out and I just I wish
something like come hug me and don't me
that back then I just want to leave that
message with you if you don't start well
then you'll never get to where you want
to be you have to start let go started
pretty low I started without you know
even a computer to edit on how was it my
mom's also editing and I do these
MacBook giveaways and I literally pray
that it ends up in someone's hands at
this they can make something big happen
out of a gift like that because God if
someone would have given me a MacBook
like that I would have fell to the floor
I mean but you know I made it without
one and and now I have three MacBook so
and I'm giving away one so hard work
never goes unnoticed and if you stay
consistent and work really hard it's
things miracles can happen so that's
pretty much it I made a bad contouring
and highlighting video sharing with you
lots of doobs share with you a little
bit of my past and my bad lighting
that's it for today's video don't forget
to subscribe to my channel before you
leave I hope this you know lets you
encourage you mostly
I hope it lets you know more about me
you know where I came from in my past
and I love you guys and I hope you have
an absolutely amazing day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
