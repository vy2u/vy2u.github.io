tired girl morning guys what's up
today's video is going to be very
special compared to a lot of my other
videos which are just makeup and reviews
and trying out things and stuff like
that but today I'm going to be
recreating my prom this year my prom
would have been 10 years ago oh my god
I don't feel like it would have been 10
years ago like it was like three years
ago life travels by so fast and then you
look back you're like oh is it weird
that like now that I have the same
mindset
I definitely don't because I was 19 when
I went to my senior prom a long story
I'll explain another video why graduate
19 no I did not film I don't know it's
like it's like my process of thinking I
still think the same thoughts I thought
whenever I was 19 I do think better I
don't know life is weird I'm getting
weird in this video let me slowly stop
whatever you're creating my prom the
only picture I have of this me and at i
scoured facebook and on tried to figure
it out but we could only find this
scrapbook page that i made for him of
our prom but can you tell me like this
is so precious come on this is the
cutest thing ever
so there's me and i I still have the
exact dress so you guys know and I will
be putting it on um that's tie right
there I cut his head off in the picture
by accident these are my girlfriends and
that's me and the orange and then these
are my girlfriends and their dates if
you're thinking the pictures out of
focus
you are wrong it's in focus it's just
that blurry and that's all I got I was
also a big-time scrapbooker I will share
that scrapbook with you guys on my vlog
channel I made a whole entire scrapbook
me and Ty pages and pages and pages ten
years ago I made it and I'll show to you
guys my blog channel and then that
you guys can see the realty also it is
prom season so you guys can definitely
follow this along if you need in spa for
a prom makeup tutorial now let's go
ahead and jump right into this video
this is kind of bittersweet doing this
now I am gonna recreate the exact makeup
look I remember doing I did my own
makeup my gym
of course I did honey I was a queen I
said I still have the dress in this
video you're gonna see me try this bad
boy on and see what it looks like on me
now what Beauty Blender someone help me
Wow I like to spell and the doorbells
ringing Jesus so I know I didn't start
off my prom makeup with a primer
basically I'm gonna do the same makeup I
did at prom and I'm gonna fix the makeup
and do it how I wish I would have done
it but the same look if that makes sense
by the way I've been using the no
problem primer I picked this up at
Sephora a while back
then I know I use my Mac Foundation and
I still love this foundation it's just
the Studio Fix I tried and trued so I'm
gonna use it today girl where was my
wife six back then it was nowhere to be
found so this is a shade NC 35 in case
you guys were wondering a smell of Mac
foundation brings me back to high school
because I wore it every day if you guys
watch me recreating the makeup I wore in
high school I kind of go over my
schooling journey with you guys more so
watch that video check it out it's awful
I get kind of emotional in it I'll miss
you guys but it's a good video and I
feel like it connects me with you guys
so much you guys understand my story a
little more with a smell of Mac
Foundation it has a very specific smell
and it reminds me of high school and
smell is the most potent thing to bring
back a memory of course I used my Mac
this is the pro longwear concealer in
shade NC 30 correct and I think a used
NC 20 back then though girl honestly I'm
just gonna put some on the sponge this
one is from morphe this is their contour
and sculpt sponge I believe it's called
it's my favorite sponge from them it is
a little bit harder than the Beauty
Blender but it's
and it gets really big and puffy so I
use it all the time who's go to prom
come on comment down below I want to
know who's going to prom back whatever I
went to prom the prom hairstyle was
everybody did like the up hairstyle and
like this big hair curled thing with
little curls coming down like that was
just the look that you went for I don't
think I don't know if that's the look
now I see stuff on Twitter and I see all
kinds of different really beautiful
hairstyles you guys let me know like
what what's the look now but I remember
on my prom I was like you know it's my
day it's my prom day I am going to get
my hair done and like relax and like
make it look really good and go to these
fancy people and pay them a lot of my
own money and get my hair done well you
already know this story's going south I
remember I set my makeup with a pressed
powder for prom not like a loose powder
I didn't bake or anything like that so
to be fair right now I'm gonna set the
makeup with this pressed powder this one
is super bougie and I'm not forcing you
and saying you need to buy it I just
enjoy it the Lumiere pressed powder oh I
went and got my hair done with my best
friend she I'll show you her toe right
there she had this beautiful side
ponytail not gonna lie I was a little
jealous cuz I was like God everybody set
up to curl it's like you something game
honey remember I like showed the picture
the woman a picture of like Jessica
Simpson like a really pretty updo kind
of update was like a different look how
my hair came out nothing like that I
looked insane I was so pissed because I
was like oh my god now I had to pay her
like a hundred and something dollars and
I could just literally done this myself
I'm gonna take donut in the 8h palette
right here and contour my face on prom I
remember I would just put bronzer
everywhere including big-time on the top
of my nose just really into just
bronzing the whole face today we're
gonna relive that and not really do it
that way Akitas gonna be doing a similar
video I was thinking about doing this
video now so back and forth on I was
like do I really want to relive this to
really wonder we do this and then Nikita
had called me and told me she was doing
a similar video so I she kind of pushed
me into doing it so whenever she uploads
her video definitely check out on her
channel whenever I got back to the house
which actually went over to Ashley's
house whenever I got back so we can
clam with our hair being done I took my
hair completely down bobby pins out just
go I'm going out of this
yes sheer panic because we were low on
time of course you know my hair was
supposed to be done and I'm just like
completely redoing it panicking in the
bathroom so I remember I was like girl
and I turned the hair out I just want to
sit so this is my hair I did this big
half-up half-down with a swoop bang and
I did like a poof in the back I think it
turned out pretty good the poof was
really popular like to have volume up
here or you could do the poof right here
whenever I was in high school
definitely not popularity now and I look
back at pictures of me with a poof and
I'm like why did you do the poof all the
top Laura I did go to prom with Tyler we
were together we started dating our
senior year in high school and promised
normally at the end of the school year
so we were together I don't think we
were dating for very long at all we
started dating at the very end of the
school year we started a in February so
I guess it wasn't the very end he told
me he'll put on a suit at thinest video
or like his best suit days got so we can
like try to retake the picture I know I
didn't wear a highlighter to my prom
that just wasn't a thing so I'm gonna
have to put one on today I'm gonna put
on Bane from this 8h palette which is
this lighter one right here I've been
enjoying oh yes I can't imagine how much
highlighter is used on prom night now in
2018 I definitely wore a blush I
absolutely have no idea what blush but
I'm just gonna put on this one called
driven I just been wearing this one
everyday so I figure you must add a
blush because I know I wore blush I'm
gonna go ahead and set that with some
tatcha this is the luminous dewy skin
mist and then I'll start on my eyes I'm
just gonna fill them in thank God I
would fill them in anyways to show
myself how I would have done them I wish
like I could just see not the future
whenever I was 19 and in high school I
wish I could just see a glimpse and I
know that would probably ruin everything
and change everything but I just wish I
could see the glimpse so I could have
more confidence I was a confident person
like I never thought I was really
ugly I never like hated myself more so
like I was just always considered dumb
because of my grade I just wish I could
fast forward and just get a glimpse of
the future and it showed me how smart I
am me I didn't get geometry different
subjects like that but she was still a
very wise woman hmm I think I've always
been very driven as a person I think
I've always had a drive to really want
things but not really see excuses or
accept excuses I think I've seen its
uses for myself but not accept them I
think that how I've gotten to where I'm
in my career I think success is to paste
on each human being I don't think
success is a particular thing or amount
of money you have some people just want
to be a mom and if they have children
then they're very successful in their
book and some people just want to work
high up at a bank and if they get that
job and they are very successful some
people want to be an actor and once they
make it make millions then they're
successful I don't think there's just
like one success I'm doing what I want
to do and I feel like I'm doing it well
so I consider myself successful no if I
could go back and get myself advice and
if you guys are in high school or
college or whatever you're doing
honestly you just need to believe in
yourself a little bit more that's what I
wish I could tell myself okay
I used this specific lorac palette it
was so old I had like five shades in it
and I spent a lot of money on it and it
was very special to me and I
specifically remember the gold eye that
I did with it and I remember I used that
gold eyeshadow so much then when it came
time I was like hitting pan and running
out but whenever we got really close to
prom time I quit using it because I knew
I needed to save the rest of the gold
eyeshadow for prom night and I'm
swimming in a pool of eyeshadow and I
have the world's great eyeshadow palette
right here I'm not being talking I'm
just kidding but I really do love this
palette and the gold was so similar I
think it this one is a little bit deeper
but I feel like the gold was very
similar to all natural somebody using
nuba to you today and this is the
perfect prom palette by the way self
promo bug honey the plug
really is I mean look at the friggin
palette it's prom wedding special
occasion makeup central also in everyday
palette because I use it every single
day I'm gonna show you guys the look I
did but enhance the look to make it look
better than what I did first I'll go in
with undress and I'm just gonna go back
and forth you know you guys know I like
to use this shade like a light
transition shade as like they're very
like transition my darling I think I was
so nervous on prom night I don't know
why would I swear I remember coming very
nervous and remember his mom let us take
he had like an old Jeep Cherokee but
like a really old one I didn't have a
car yes they did I had an old Honda but
it barely worked I think by the end of
the year I had quit working so I was out
of a car his mom let's take her accurate
a prom it's like funny the little things
you remember she I'm gonna take strip
and streaking I mix these two together
all the time and they're kind of random
colors to mix together but I do and they
turn out really pretty so I'm just gonna
strip in streaking and I'm gonna also
blend these in the crease I remember she
did the darker outer corner I did a
really dark outer corner and then a gold
eyelid that was the lick I'm gonna grab
a little bit of butt-naked and pop it on
that outer corner
weird how make of that like early on was
already like a fantasy to me and just
like fascinating I'm gonna go ahead and
build it up even more and take the
darkest shade Nicki Nicki and this
actually I'm gonna take a r39 for us
which is a little bit of a smaller
blender so weird how like when I was in
high school I thought high school was
just that's all life had to offer which
is high school it's weird because you go
to elementary school junior high in the
end of eighth I mean besides college you
go to high school and I don't know why
my mindset was that small I swore high
school was just it honey now that I'm 10
years out of high school realize like
what a teeny teeny tiny portion that
high school is of your life three years
of your life well now for because I
think they consider ninth grade high
school but it's such a tiny part of your
life there are memories made in high
school that you'll remember forever
that's for sure but there
some memories maybe remember forever
like in everything in life so why high
school seemed so significant to me it
was special and I'm glad you know I had
good high school years and all but I
just don't know why I thought it was all
of life life goes on after high school
very quickly now for the show-stopping
moment I'm finally gonna take all
natural was just a foiled gold shade I'm
gonna go ahead and carve out a little
bit with that Mac concealer which I
never would have done this in high
school this was beyond my skill level
where I filmed my reveal video I was
trying to do a look using it and my
camera cut out so I feel like also this
video is kind of like a redemption from
that moment because I definitely screwed
up I apologize to you guys for that
you're like hello the main moment we
didn't even get to see you put it on
that is my bad my camera quit filming
and I didn't realize it filming and then
there was a little snippet of it that
did get caught on camera but I was like
this putting it on and the mirror wasn't
focused and I was out of focus so I just
messed up completely I like to use a
flat brush or my finger my finger works
wonderfully with it I do wet the color
this is an import to one brush and I
normally spritz spritz it with a little
bit of mac fix+ but if you don't have
that fix lesson you want to what the
color you can just use dampen your brush
a little bit with water I remember in
high school I would lick my brushes to
get them wet the updated version is mac
fix+ but just know if you're licking
your brushes I'm not judging you okay
exciting news so nerdy patootie is now
sold on more PBS calm it's in all morphe
stores on beautybay comm from
international followers if you don't
want to pay those expensive shipping
fees beautybay comm is where it's at I
remember on prom like I didn't where we
eyeliner and in high school at all but I
did put on a little strip of liner
curling these lashes I did wear false
lashes on prom but they probably say
probably they were not Miami Lily lashes
I can go ahead and tell you that time to
reveal who these little stickies off
these are wildly convenient we're
getting close to being finished guys I
just gonna add some of these colors so
I'm gonna mix this two and blend it out
in the lower lash line and I like to
connect it right
there and even soften up that harsh line
a little bit now I'm just gonna add a
touch of butt-naked right in the lower
lashline did deepen it up I wanted to
look nice and smoky for lips I just went
ahead and added a little bit of jaybird
which is my own liquid lipstick and now
I'm going on a little bit of quickie
from colour-pop I'm gonna in the center
so as far as hair I'm gonna recreate the
same hair I think I did a pretty good
job of it just curling each piece I will
admit like I am NOT a professional hair
person if someone asked me to
professionally do their hair and like
pay me for the job I would probably tell
them no I would definitely do I did do
makeup
you know freelance but as far as hair
like girl that's different I'm like I do
pretty decent hair on myself whenever
I'm not being lazy but I feel like
that's everybody
whatever we try we all do good job kind
of dreading putting that pouf in my hair
but that's definitely not what I want to
do for today's here if I was going to
prom but that's okay okay we'll make it
look good as it good so this is just a
new me wine this is what I always used
to curl my hair with this isn't
sponsored by new me just so you know
it's just a new me one and I'm just
holding it upside down and wrapping the
hairs around it curling them I'm gonna
kind of mess them up and put halfway up
so I'm not making the curls perfect I
would try to make them a little more
perfect oh it's gonna wear my hair down
but I'm not alright I went ahead and
parted my hair on this side because I
did like this side bay they actually
kind of like this and we just gotta
tease the back a little bit
I'm gonna add just some hairspray get
the poof going it's kind of like this
massive Philly this needs like a little
munchies in love I did have some
glamorous earrings in so I just got
these from forever 21 they're pretty
similar to what I wore
so this is Thais palm look he did wear a
full tuxedo but we don't have that which
looks super snazzy you did wear a black
bowtie yeah but today he's wearing
maroon and I had a little bit different
hair a little bit out and cert photo
here so you guys can see the difference
bad but you look sharp
my friend you look these are the exact
shoes that I wore slippers hug slippers
so yeah he looks fantastic and he's
still my little date yeah is a cat
scratch just so you guys know we're
right there you can't even see that
Alison's not marking on me anyway so
this is us prom I hope you guys enjoyed
the video and it's definitely cool to
reminisce and remember I haven't put
this dress on in 10 years so Wow
I know I think if it's the same my
pucker image I think yeah his tux was
rented I think my butt's a little bigger
but not much about your boobs I've done
a lot of squats in 10 years so I think
my butt is more muscular as well I would
just like to say that you look gorgeous

prom time cuz I forgot to tell her how
beautiful she looked you ain't got me
