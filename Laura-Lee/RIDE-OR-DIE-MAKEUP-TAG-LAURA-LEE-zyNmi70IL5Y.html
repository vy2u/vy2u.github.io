video is finally me doing the right or
die tag Thank You Jaclyn hill for
tagging me to do it and I'm gonna
address the elephant in the room
hi hair I cut my hair we're gonna chop
chop so Mitchell babe yeah I got are you
ready here this parts gonna look shorter
it's gonna look amazing oh my god no I
love it
yeah I look like layered and done it's
gonna no I think it's gonna look amazing
I am so happy I did it I love it it's so
light so much easier to fix my curls are
like I feel like more fluffy because
they're not weighed down I'm like
literally so excited about this haircut
guys you don't even know also if you
haven't subscribed to my channel ok
we're gonna jump right in and we're
gonna get started let's do it right so
actually I'm like I'm so creepy I have
the description box of her video pulled
up so I don't forget a product in that
way I said go in order so first I say
primer we're going to talk about primers
what did I do with my favorite part the
first one is going to be the cheapest
hangover RX primer this is very
moisturizing primer and it's been out
for a long time and I've loved it since
the day it came out it's really awesome
moisturizing and if I ever have dry skin
or am i traveling or something like that
I can always count on this primer to get
me through next four I'm going to try to
talk pass through out the way that way
we're not here for too long because I
personally don't watch really long video
so I attempt to not make my videos that
long and this is going to be a 30 minute
video next is foundation so my favorite
rudder dye foundation is going to be the
fit me matte and poreless this one is by
Maybelline I am in shade 220 and I know
this product hasn't been out for years
and years and years and years and years
but it has been out for minutes and ever
since the day I got it I love it I can
count on it and never makes me too matte
never makes me too greasy it's just like
that perfect
in Finnish you can get buildable
coverage to it it doesn't slough off my
face I always set my makeup which helps
makeup not sloughing off my face but
it's just an all-around good foundation
you should try it out
so for concealer I have a concealer that
came out recently that kind of trumps
all of my ride-or-die concealers so I
have to mention it by the way my gray
hair it's real today you want to leave a
comment about it down below feel free to
oh god it is the Tarte shaped tape
concealer holy bejesus stuff is like
full coverage full coverage full
coverage it's always sold out at Ulta I
don't know about Sephora because I
haven't looked and seen if it sold out
Sephora but it's always sold out there
and it's for a good reason I'm in shade
light/medium this is the bomb it doesn't
crease it covers everything and it
blends out so freaking easy it is
everything you can ask for in a
concealer and I really like the
applicator it's like a oversized Oh foot
applicator light I like it tart I like
what you're doing face powder I don't
have a Holy Grail face powder if I had
to pick one it would be the Mac Studio
Fix but face powder isn't really
something I use all the time I use like
setting powders which is what we'll get
into next is the Laura Mercier loose
translucent setting powder that I have
beat to a dead horse just beat that dead
horse you guys are like we know we get
it it's good okay
but is a Laura Mercier loose translucent
setting powder I could say this in my
safe alarm RCA Lucius is headache powder
I've gone through a bazillion of these
it's awesome um I've tried actually a
few more lately just because I'm tired
I'm so tired of beating this dead horse
I just I'm so tired doing that to you
guys so I've tried out a few more that I
haven't absolutely loving and I've been
mentioning them here and there in my
videos so you know if you're watching
you know blush okay this is a blush I've
been talking about my channel for a long
long long long time maybe not like ten
years that have been on YouTube ten
years but for a long time this one's my
Sigma this is their war powder and it's
quarter rosa
oh so pretty and I'm wearing it
today because I thought I would you know
show it
this is an actual blush that shows up
really well on my skin I don't know if
you guys have this problem but sometimes
I apply blush to my skin and it just
does not show up like wear you out or it
disappears quickly this one lasts and
you get like a lot of blush and there
are more powders I love Sigma beauty's
products but their blushes is probably
some of their best product this is my
favorite shade in it it shows up so well
on on my face and it has a holographic
packaging right for bronzer bronzer is
next what Laura was you're wrong laundry
Laura where's your bronzer my favorite
bronzer has been by Chanel okay but this
one's really good I definitely think
it's worth your money I had a makeup
artist actually use this on me and I was
like girl oh girl is chanel okay I went
out and bought it and I fell absolutely
in love with it this is this Chanel so
lace hand additional Oh bronzer but look
how much you get like this is massive
and I don't know why I think it smells
so good but it's not I don't think it's
meant to smell good I've used this like
day in and day out and I've barely put a
dent in the center of it it is a cream
bronzer but it almost blends out to a
powder super easy to blend out they
don't have multiple shades in it which
makes almost no sense at all but I wish
this shade was just like a darker and it
would be flawless um but it still works
for my skin I use it almost every day a
packet when I travel is always with me
this is just a ride-or-die bronzer
bronzer on me next is highlight and I
pick two because come on you can ask a
girl to pick her favorite what does that
even mean one hell up for it
my ride-or-die highlight is just like
it's just been there with me through
good times sad times bad times this is
Becca cosmetics opal and this is I think
probably my first high end actually
she'll by Mac was my first high in a
highlight but this was like the close
second that I bought um and their
formula is impeccable I think that's a
good word to use I don't know it's just
creamy buttery
in opal is a site perfect for my skin
tone so write or dive but let me just
say this
jus a came out with their highlights
their only 24h and then they gave us a
discount group so you get money off so
this is my favorite like of a newer
highlight that's come out so that's just
like a ride-or-die actually I've been
used up on a long time and it's just
because all these other highlights and
then playing with and I've pretty much
been using this one since it came out
every day day in day out I use this one
pretty much this is topaz buys you a
cosmetics and then the packaging is
beautiful it's like mirrored and it's
like silver gold mirrored I don't know
topaz is already barely touched it mmm
is ridiculous that's barely a swipe and
it's beautiful
I mean it is stunningly gorgeous so and
it's a good deal on them so I have truly
been loving their highlights they've
already sold out a citrine which was a
really good one but they do have this
one in stock past scare all right let's
move on
this one's easy for me this is the Marc
Jacobs velvet new or mascara I think
it's the best mascara on the market I
mean there are drugstore ones don't get
me wrong that I I use all the time but
if I had to pick one like if you twisted
my arm behind my back I would say this
one alright so I'm not gonna lie to you
I'm a big fan of like big lashes and I
know you guys would never guess that
about me
but some lashes have stuck with me from
the dawn of time is the icon come down
there buddy
it's the iconic spy House of lashes I
cannot tell you how many pairs of these
I have bolts whenever I start at YouTube
this is like the only lash I would put
on and I remember they were so like worn
down and I would like try to pick the
glue off and like put them on and be
like they're they're good they're just
awesome I love them I see people wear
them on time I'm like you got on iconic
yeah girl you know I know
you know I know that's what I do to
people I shadow palette
guys know I had a safe okay so as for me
and violet boss we sold out of this
pallet and it won't be restocked this is
the pallet I came out with with them
it's beautiful I'm obsessed with it I
still use it all the freaking time it
was such a great success I want to say a
big thank you to you guys your feedback
on it was absolutely amazing I still
want people tweeting me all the time
telling me this is the pallet they use
day in and day out and I told you when I
came out with this pallet that's what I
wanted it to be for and you guys are
just killing it thank you so much for
buying it I appreciate it
I love her so much I will tell you a few
retailers did pick up this pallet lady
Moss and I think friends if I can find
it online steel I will have it for sure
link down in my description box but as
for me and violet Voss we won't be
making any more of them we are sold out
forever okay so because that is a soil
item I chose to pick if I had to pick a
second one just a pallet to travel with
that I love it's just a go to come on
get out of my mouth hair I think
everybody needs in their life is the
morphe 35o now you may not have heard me
talk about this palette like a crapload
on my channel
it was always sold out and I really
don't like to talk about things that are
always out of stock because it's like
come on it gets old you know now it's
always in in stock so I feel like I'm
more free to talk about it but the
morphe 35o it's mattes and shimmers now
they do have the morphe 35o s which is
all shimmers in the morphe 35o M which
is all matte both of those are amazing
it just depends on what you want you
love warm tones is your dream palette
liquid lipsticks I think I skipped it so
we're gonna go back and pretend that I
didn't but I haven't makes sure liquid
lipsticks I'm obsessed with first is she
weighs noisette which is a ma B brown
tone color and I like to love love this
one apply this one all over my lips and
right whenever it's getting to that
almost dry stage then I take Jeffrey
stars I'm nude which is one of the book
Jeffrey's liquid lipstick formula is one
of the best in our market it is so
freakin good
anyways I take this I'm nude and I just
to the center of my lips only leaving
the edges out
then I take my finger and Pat it out and
it gives you the most beautiful color
this is just like my ride-or-die I've
been wearing these two together for a
long time and yeah I take them
everywhere with me
these two are always in my purse as far
as a setting spray I have two I cannot
pick one because they do different
things first is the MBK all nighter
setting makeup spray this helps to make
it last it doesn't do anything funky to
my face and I can always count on it so
I love it and then we have the Mac prep
in front prying mac fix+ spray now this
one's a little bit different it like
enhances the makeup rather than makes it
last longer it can also add a little bit
of nourishing to your skin so they're
great in two different ways I typically
pick one or the other I don't go like
just and wear them this just looking a
lot of setting spray on your face it
just depends on what I'm going to be
doing where I'm gonna be going yeah now
don't have a favorite lipstick or lip
gloss because I wear liquid lipsticks
pretty much that's it I just don't have
a ride-or-die one I like I would be
making it up if I said I did so I'm not
going to do that did you have a favorite
perfume which I'll mention this one's by
YSL this is the Mon powdery I think
that's what the name of it is anyways
this is their newest one I picked it up
at Sephora madly in love with it if
you're a Sephora just give it a whirl
I think as adults as well give it a
sniff it's seriously the best I have it
on right now every time I inhale I smell
beautiful things cuz I farted just
kidding
and that is it for my ride-or-die tag I
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did
subscribe to my channel if you didn't
subscribe to my channel and I hope to
see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
