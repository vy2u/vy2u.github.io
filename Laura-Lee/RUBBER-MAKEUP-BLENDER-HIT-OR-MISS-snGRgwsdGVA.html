video is going to be on the Eevee
blender this is like a rubber they call
it a silicone blender but it's really
like rubber like it films is just like a
bouncy ball excited to try it out um I'm
a little skeptical about it honestly
jumping into zaman be honest with you I
bet they're silicone blender I really
didn't like so this one I'm like is this
going to work it's even a more odd shape
subscribe to my channel before you leave
so without further ado we're going to
jump right in and we're gonna I guess I
love it and we're gonna try out this EP
blender girl does it work
is it a hit is it a Miss I know so the
first thing on our agenda is to remove
the cake so you can blend out basically
anything liquid with it apparently I did
watch a video on how to use it so that
way I don't mess it up and I use it
right that's good right I have zoomed
you in so here is my skin and the actual
blender came in this random bag and it
literally didn't come wrapped in a box
or anything it's just like thrown in
this bag I got I'll kick starter that is
what it looks like I was trying to play
with it earlier it's like a rubbery
bouncy balls very squishy and then the
bowl it feels sticky like like a rubber
substance and it says easy blender down
in there it also came with a mirror and
it also says wash before your first root
use natural occurring or old may be
present from the manufacturer it also
smells like chemicals so like the whole
bit I'm like and I'll be really honest
with you I ordered this top Kickstarter
months ago and it's expensive it's $28
so it's time enough horrible product and
girl I'm like I already had a rough time
with it we even got started in two
months to come in
I forgot that idea that I even ordered
it and here we are with us so hopefully
it's a miracle product because it was
hard to get so just with the shipping
and price and all I'm already like
on it we're still going to review it and
see what's going to happen so just so
you're aware I literally just looking at
it thought you like put foundation in
the divot and just something with it but
apparently that's not what you do is
look for your finger to rest and so you
can pout your foundation today I'm going
to be using a little busy la girl Pro
Foundation let me get a mirror and what
they were doing online is applying it to
the skin first and then testing healthy
product okay so they got having a
foundation on I'm kind of nervous so I
have my finger rest in there and they
just use the butt of it the side of it
and all to smooth out so interesting
interesting interesting so the nice
thing about rubbery silicone II sponges
or applicators is that they don't hold
up any of your products the product just
sits on top of them so you don't waste
product um I feel like but because it is
silicone that it's like making like
weird streaks like I don't see how I
forget this foundation perfectly smooth
and just because the product is rubber
it feels kind of rough on my face I
should have got my lipstick hmm kind of
hard to get around those brows because I
feel like this I feel I feel like it's
not blending in the product I feel like
it's just moving the product onto my
face now whenever you want it you want I
like melt the product cut it into your
skin whenever you're blending out makeup
rather than just move it around and
because this has no like the brush
fibers will grab some product and kind
of just push it into the skin it so they
can softly blend it out
with a bind or a Beautyblender but this
feeling it's literally just moving the
foundation around hello Lara GaN focus
also as my first impressions on it my
foundation looks a little bit cake here
and it's like hard to get her like and
do you see that hair get off of me what
okay that was not a hair that was
streaks look Oh streaks as I was in here
and it was just taken me a lot longer to
get my foundation blend it out let me
take all this lipstick by the way I do
not like these I got these and I don't
like them at all so I'm just like using
them up to get this lipstick off of it
these are rough life and they don't use
it like scrub to your makeup off with
them back to the blender to work in and
do you feel like any areas it's like
really hard to get it blended out
because it doesn't like eggs or onyx
it's just like moving it kind of streaky
very rough too because I have to press a
little bit hard but my foundation is
blended out hmm
just being honest there's no way I'm
going to put like a tool this hard on my
face every day and like press and like
rub in I feel like if I did it like
really soft I would literally be here
for three years let me my foundation and
ain't nobody at the time and they said I
am close I'm going to grab a little bit
of my shape tape concealer and I'm going
to apply it and then we're going to see
I'm going to use a little bit like a
kind of smaller amount than like there's
a whole bit with it because this product
just doesn't exorbitant just moves it so
I don't want to mess so this is me doing
it soft and like literally three years
later I would have the product blend it
out I also still because this one's so
rubbery I feel like the other one I
forget what it's called - silly sponge
that's the name of it it was definitely
way more silicone E and it wasn't as
aggressive where it's it was like
see how they pulled on a masking on the
skin like even when I do it really soft
it's like tugging and I'm with a beauty
blender instead of tugging I would pack
so this one girl having this with this
oh how are you going to get blended out
it's nothing my face feels sore I feel
like that would be dramatic but my face
is honestly it's tired of being pushed
on right here like the skin just kind of
like okay are you done
um it is blending out my makeup though I
mean it's working so we can't say that
the product doesn't work there's just no
way I want to touch on my under eyes
with this either like everyday I'm
already at a rough makeup applier and
the last thing I need is something to
make me do my makeup even more rough so
I think I need like dabbing it is even
almost more painful it feels like I'm
dabbing a rock on my skin but look how
good it blends that makeup pros and cons
people we got pros and cons I know you
guys think I've kind of laid out on the
table though it's ands and buts about it
would you wait a month for it would you
pay $28 plus shipping for it um you know
it's hard to get it's expensive it's
hard as a rock
it takes forever to blend out the makeup
versus a beauty blender I feel like
usually get some skin damage because of
how rough it is on the skin it's awkward
to move in like shaped areas on your
face but at the end of the day it does
blend out like the finished product my
makeup looks super blended out so we
have some debating to do let it roll in
the comment section down below like
would you buy this would you buy an on a
shelf as well as a CVS or would you you
know go through the process of having to
get it like I did do you think it's
worth it would you use it on your skin I
mean like I feel like my makeup is
pretty seamlessly I offset this
concealer but I feel like my makeup is
pretty seamlessly blended out what do
you guys think I want to hear feedback
kind of short and sweet video I mean I
got right to the point people
how rough it is that's my main point
it's kind of annoying to use and a
Beautyblender girl this is nasty but
they're just so easy and I feel like you
get the blended outlook too however
another problem this product is you're
going to waste a lot less products with
a this versus a beauty blender or brush
because they drink up some of your
product not like a wild amount but this
isn't going to drink up any of your
product also you cannot pop this on your
skin because it would leave weird we
already kind of rough to pat but it
would leave weird marks on your skin
because I'm going to show you do you see
how it's textured mm-hmm I will say I
like the little finger divot it makes it
really easy to hold so I do like that in
it and yeah that's about it guys that's
my review that's all I got for you I bet
I think I broke it down for you the best
I can
I also don't like that it's not like
still different packaging and then it's
like watchful for you use because it
could have like manufactured a little
bottom on like dairy also be sure and
subscribe to my channel but bug and I
hope this video was fun for you guys I'd
really go so sure guess that's about it
for this video and I love you guys so
much thank you so much for being here
and watching and I'll catch you all in
the next video
