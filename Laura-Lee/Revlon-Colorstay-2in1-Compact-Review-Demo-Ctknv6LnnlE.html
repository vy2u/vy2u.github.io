we're going to be talking about the
Revlon Colorstay 2 in one compact make
it plus concealer which looks like this
right here you guys always request
foundation reviews from me so here is
another one I hope you guys enjoy the
video also don't forget to subscribe
before you leave for more reviews and a
fun things going on on this channel so
we're going to jump right in and get
started let's do it I just want to show
you guys what it actually looks like so
it comes in a compact that looks like
this with a clear top and you just pop
it open you get a full foundation and
concealer inside the product what
happens is you can flip the little
floppy which has the concealer in it and
you get into your foundation and then
you lift it again you actually get this
nice mirror and an applicator sponge
which looks like a teardrop we'll get
into more of how the useless parts in
the demo which is going to be at the end
I'm in shade 220 which is natural beige
so that's normally my shade with rub rub
rub one foundations so what actually
happened whenever I first got it I was
like oh no the shade is too dark for me
and it looks a little bit darker than
what it actually is whenever it hasn't
been touched in it's brand-new in the
packaging so what you want to do to pick
out your shade is to actually compare it
to the concealer because the concealer
is one shade loud it's lighter than the
foundation or you can just pick out what
you're normally are in a Revlon
foundation and it will be the same shade
because as you can see like on camera
you see where I dabbed in it with my
sponge you can see that that's lighter
because that right there is my actual
color so no worries it's still the same
Revlon shades that we've seen before so
for those even wondering it does come in
12 different shades you can get it at
any drugstore just about and it ranges
from like twelve to fifteen dollars so
it's a good price foundation for the
drugstore and plus you're getting a
concealer and foundation in one so you
know it's good deal it's a nice little
compact I think it's good for on-the-go
because you have all your product in
this little compact right here also I
think it's good because a lot of people
have a lot of trouble you know getting
that right concealer share they go to
light or they get it too close to their
foundation shade so what you actually
want to do whenever picking out your
concealer shade is to go
one shade lighter than your foundation
shade and that's exactly what red wants
done here in this little color stay um
compact here it was absolutely perfect
for covering blemishes or highlighting a
face so let us talk about what I feel
about the product and what I like about
the product and you know my thoughts on
so as far as the actual product the
foundation I like a lot and let me just
let you know that sometimes compact
makeup scares me a little because it can
be really thick and heavy so I'm not
gonna lie whenever I first got it I was
like a little bit skeptical but I've
been using it some and I actually really
like it and that's really what I wanted
to review for you guys today and let you
guys know about it whenever you go into
it it is extremely creamy product so
it's not going to be very thick and
heavy whatsoever and then once you blend
it out it's actually pretty lightweight
foundation however it does have a good
medium coverage to it so it's not too
heavy and it's not just like cake on
your face and I will say this it is an
extremely long wearing product I kind of
this foundation concealer be absolutely
perfect if you were like going to work
all day needed a good foundation for
your job all day or you're in school all
day you just don't have time for a lot
of touch-ups and stuff like that this is
going to be a good long wearing
foundation and whenever I blend it out
it blends out almost into like a powdery
form instead of like a really heavy
cream thick um foundation so with that
being said I think this product would be
great if you have oily skin and I also
think it would be good for combination
skin I have dry skin mostly and it looks
pretty good on me really happy with the
finish and also mostly happy with the
longevity of the product
I personally won't wear a foundation if
it doesn't last long it just sank for me
really cool thing about this you may not
know is a sweat resistant so if you have
PE or you're running around your job I
know when I want the medical assistant
Lord Jesus knows I was sweating this is
sweat resistant so it will hold up and
be your best friend alright so now we're
going to obviously be demoing it out I'm
going to using is that applicator that
it comes with it looks like this what I
will be doing to apply it is using the
bigger end in the foundation so I'll
just kind of DAB it in there get a
little bit on my sponge and now I'm just
going to apply it all over I like to tap
the product on it first and then like
softly smooth it out
again let me just say I think a little
bit of this foundation goes a long way I
don't think you needed completely dig in
and saturate your sponge I think just
dabbing on the product a little bit
whether it gets plenty of product here's
a close-up of my face on this half I
have the foundation on this half I don't
I just did one simple application of the
foundation as you can see was blending
in my skin very easily just very
smoothly clotting on so now I'm going to
show you the concealer and kind of how I
use that we're going to be using the
pointy tip of our applicator so here is
the concealer and I'm just going to dab
a little bit so you guys know I like to
use my concealer for the under eyes to
cover those dark circles so I'm going to
use this corner just get right up in
there and then we're just going to Pat
it out I love that it's one shade
lighter so we get that highlighted
effect because whenever you highlight
the under eye and go one shade lighter
it really helps to push out that
underlie eye to make it look more awake
and more bright it feels lightweight the
dry time on the foundation is fast fast
fast and my face doesn't feel sticky
whatsoever
I also concealed all these blemishes I
had going on I had a few over here and
it did a really good job of covering
those and that is it for this video I
hope it guys helped you out and give you
some more information about this product
