been for everyone a day since I've done
a mascara review so for today's video
we're going to be reviewing the Revlon
super length mascara it looks like this
comes with a little green lid on the top
and also at the end of the video I'm
going to be demoing it out so stay till
the end um be sure to subscribe to my
channel before you leave because you
don't want to miss out on some review be
sure to subscribe and let's jump into
the video well personally let me just
say this about drugstore mascaras dry my
tears are probably the most amazing
mascaras on the market and I honestly
think they have a good reputation there
are a lot of high-end mascaras out of
course but I just think drugstore takes
the cake with mascaras they've always
just been the best at creating mascara
so that's why I want to take the time to
review and for you guys but I end up
buying black Brown
so with that being said I actually like
white brown a lot I mean you couldn't
really tell the difference in my opinion
it looks kind of like black which I was
really happy about so yeah is the new
Revlon super linked mascara this formula
does coat the lashes very easily it is
lengthening to the lashes I'm wearing it
right now I'm not wearing false lashes I
dip it on two layers to this for a more
lengthy lash look and go ahead and tell
you one thing I do like about this
mascara is that it builds up very easily
because my rescuers I typically never
just put one coat of mascara on and less
I'm putting on false lashes but if I'm
just going my natural lashes
I always put one too maybe you can go in
crazy three coats of mascara and so my
mascaras have to build up easy for me
and I like that this one dried kind of
quick so we didn't get goopy in between
my lashes and I was able to build up the
mascara to get the look that I wanted
out of it
why on it is a little bit large it does
grab the lashes well though I didn't
have a problem with it whenever you get
really close in to your inner lashes
though don't go crazy because it will
bump your eyelid a little bit so I was
scared because the one's kind of big to
grab my little lashes but one actually
tapers in so it gets a little bit
smaller at the top and I use the top
part of the one to grab those little
bottom lashes and actually worked out
really well for me along bristles
throughout the one are meant to give you
a link to your lashes it like the way
this mascara linked in my lashes it
definitely built them up I do think it
also added a
a volume image in my lashes I don't feel
like my lashes are too clumpy I did like
I said add two layers so the more layers
you add of a mascara it's gonna get a
little bit more complex
this is a mascara that you're using I
did experience just a little bit of fall
out while applying this mascara so I
just swept it away with a brush but I
haven't noticed much else fall out
lately down in the comments if you tried
this mascara or any of the new rebel
mascaras and let me know your thoughts
so now we're gonna jump into the demo of
the mascara
let's go tried egg here goes the demo so
of course just trying it on clean lashes
I normally start off really slow at the
base of my lashes and then I work it
upward as I my favorite habit to do
whenever applying mascara is to do this
weird blinking thing where I press the
one onto my lashes by blinking very hard
it's just my preference in how I apply
my mascara but you do you boo
so I started using the center or middle
of the wand to apply it to my upper
lashes and then as you notice I'm using
the front part of the wand because it
tapers into coat those lashes in the
inner corner as well as those bottom
lashes because I didn't want to make a
mess with it and honestly that is the
best way to use this mascara overall
felt like the mascara really built up
nicely because it dries pretty quick and
it definitely linked in my lashes as you
can see in the before and after her eyes
me doing this before and after kind of
maybe want to wear false lashes less
what Who am I
but um yeah I really like the mascara so
that's it for my review of this mascara
