get in here
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a review video I'm
going to be reviewing the blintze part
revolution and makeup application
automated makeup brush system I feel
like I read too much stuff it's just a
rotating makeup brush that I bought off
Sephora
it cost me it was $69 but after tax and
all it ran me about seventy seven or
seventy six dollars something like that
so it was a pricey brush um I bought it
was my own money they're not sponsoring
me or anything I just saw it on there I
picked it up cuz you guys know I'm
trying to do more cool bitch also you
may have noticed oh I fell asleep on a
boat we went on a Carnival cruise
meeting a couple different influencers
it wasn't a brand trip we all just paid
for it ourselves and took a little
vacation this summer and we had the best
time ever and be sure to check out my
vlog I've logged it we had I think three
hours of vlog footage we're gonna cut
that down obviously but I think when I
have two blogs go up on my blog channel
check it out I'll link it right on down
below you are now a girlfriend boyfriend
whoever's watching watch so we're gonna
be reviewing this brush anyways it's
supposed to like um you know be a 360
automatic blending brush it sounds like
it's gonna be something super cool and I

subscribe to hey subscribe today hey
half my subscribers just and subscribe
for that singing and dance part hmm
anyways we're gonna jump right in and
get started let's do it jumping in
here's the box and on the back it says
blends evenly better coverage gentle
rotating motion so it gives you a little
run down and then you pop it out of the
package it was like it's a battery the
foundation head and then the actual
brush I was reading the pamphlet and it
says that it comes with different a
powder head and a blush head that you
can buy separately with those heads were
26 bucks each other kind of pricey
whoa I just opened in everything
whenever were oh it looks like you
unscrew the bottom and pop the battery
and we'll get through the boring part
and then we'll get to the good stuff and
then you pop oh oh you pop the head on
oh very soft brush it's like a stippling
brush feels really good oh my god I'm
excited to use this guy's it's better
workout cool so I wonder if I should
apply a makeup to the brush or to my
face let's see what it says it says
apply the makeup evenly like dot dot dot
dot dot to your face not to the brush
and pull your hair back so your hair
doesn't get wound up in the brush the
brush is heavy just let you know that so
it says for best results don't work it
in a circular motion let the brush do it
for you so I don't know is it you just
go up and down like if you don't do
circular that's just weird to me Oh
glides slowly across your face huh let's
do it let's just do it let's quit
talking about it in the water so I'm
just going to add a little bit of facial
primer to my skin okay done and now I'm
going to add the foundation I'm just
going to use a little bit of this ex1
foundation I said use less product
because less is want more less is more
less is more that's what it said this is
f 200 if you're just curious what shade
I'm going to be using so a dot here a
dot there I'm going to do two dots is
this it very gently glided across your
face not applying a lot of pressure to
the brush I feel like I'm about to like
drill into my face oh my gosh like I'm
chiseling away do you hear it
it's blending the makeup
I'm not following their rules on the
motion it says to use less makeup
because it's supposed to like spread the
makeup out better for you so you don't
have to use as much foundation but yo
you
what the hell and it says don't get it
around your hairline so then do you go
in with your own makeup brush with for
your hair lines go across the forehead
do you see how it's kind of like unless
you press hard it doesn't move the
foundation a lot I'm pressing kind of
hard now so I'm like move the foundation
the brush shoot anyone baby hair
but do you see like how the foundation
didn't even move I'm going up and down
instead of a circular motion just trying
to get my face covered I mean I'm not
going to lie it did move the foundation
but it's almost like it's like a lot of
work to get the foundation to move I
want to do this much more so I
definitely think definitely think I need
to add more foundation just because I
get my literally I have no foundation
over here also my question is if you pay
$70 and you have to use another tool to
get the foundation around your hairline
which I do recommend blending your
foundation around your hairline and all
I mean you shouldn't have to use another
tool but I think you do have to for the
safety of the spinning rotation on the
products my foundation is blended out
nice and it isn't streaky that's very
true I think that's mostly because
there's like a stippling brush on here
and so that it doesn't leave this nice
streaks but I'm doing my hairline kind
of anyway I do I do find that it is a
little bit of work to get your
foundation blend it out but didn't feel
like it was pulling or tugging on my
skin so that was nice I definitely had
to use the same amount of foundation and
kept building it up to get an even
coverage with it was really hard to give
a foundation even I definitely don't
think you can use less makeup with this
product and it says but one dot on each
cheek and I already had started with two
dots on each cheek so I'd already
doubled it up on my cheek and it still
wasn't enough because like this whole
half of my face there is no makeup on it
and I was looking a little cray-cray and
also I just see a little about it
whenever it says you can't get near your
hairline because y'all my baby hairs are
real and I have to get up in here with
foundation or else you can definitely
tell a difference so that was a little
bit of a about it the brush isn't cheap
I mean it's a $70 brush and the parts of
my foundation that it did blend I mean
then blended it out so pale but I don't
know guys it took me a lot longer to
blend out my foundation than it normally
would so I do think that this product is
a little bit gimmicky from me I
definitely don't see myself using it on
the Ray
dealer I mean what a guy confused this
is something else I think it is a cool
innovative product in makeup even in the
past year makeup has grown so much and
there's so many new brands and new tools
it's really interesting to see them and
see if they work or throw up but this
one's like in-between it works it does
what it says it does but just me using
it and me just trying to register in my
brain for everyday life I definitely
wouldn't grab this brush to use because
it's more work than what it's worth and
you can't get near your hairline with it
which is a big problem for people like
me with an abundance of baby hair the
brush was super interesting though and I
enjoyed using it at like a little it's a
little weird a little weird
I hope my run down on it helped you guys
out and you know gave you some insight
on this rotating makeup brush what do
you guys think be sure to let me know
down in the comments I'll be reading
your comments I'm really interested in
what you thought about the product would
you pay $70 for the brush yes or no
