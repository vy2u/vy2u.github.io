video is a super-duper exciting video
because we're finally through the
threshold of the year and we are getting
close to Christmas time which is the
best time of the year
love Christmas time who's with me as if
I can hear you but I see your comments
down below let me know see your comments
down below
total rhyming right now anyway support
gave me a bunch of their gift sets and
I'm going to be able to show you a sneak
peak of the holiday set as well as I got
to see a sneak peak of all the cool
stuff coming out in the holiday catalog
from Sephora so these are exclusive
items and I am so excited to share them
with you and the gift sets look bomb
diggity this year and I think that's one
of the most exciting parts of the year I
know for me personally a lot of times I
would go into Sephora and buy the gift
set for myself because it's such like a
bargaining deal because you get so much
more bang for your buck whenever they
put it together and a gift set that's
just me personally I'm going to be
giving these to other people as
Christmas gifts actually so and I'll
share that with you too anyways we're
going to jump right in the video be sure
and subscribe to my channel before you
leave that way you don't miss out on my
lunatic Ness I was going to switch up
the word crazy but lunatic nuts isn't
working so we're just gonna stick with
craziness so you don't miss out on my
craziness and we're gonna jump right in
the video let's do it
the first gifts that I want to share
with you is probably one of the most
exciting it is glam glow which is an
extremely popular skincare set it's got
the super mud mask the thirsty hydrating
treatment as well as the youth mud in it
this one's going to cost one hundred and
fifty-two dollars this is a trio of
their best-selling map these masks they
smooth they hydrate they soften the skin
they do so much for your skin and I'm
actually going to be giving this one to
Patrick Starr because this skin needs
all the help it can get I'm kidding guys
it was a joke Patrick is one of the
biggest lovers of gloom glow so what
more of a perfect gift for old Patti
Starr then to give them a little Glen
glow inside so this one goes
to Patty another really exciting one I
bought one similar to this last year for
myself of course but another exciting
one coming out as a Peter Thomas Roth
this is the mask of Hall it's set it's a
few hundred and thirty dollar value and
it sold for seventy-five bucks
this also includes a signature face mask
applicator so this is pretty much good
for all skin types it's good for oily
skin combination skin normal skin dry
skin and I'm going to be giving this one
to Jack where Jackie is obsessed with
Peter Thomas Roth I think that girl does
a face mask every day of the week so I'm
gonna hook her up with variety in her
life I know one of her favors is the the
14 karat gold gold 14 karat gold gold
mask I say gold twice hmm this mask is
probably one of her favorites and it's
one of my favorites as well it's so good
yeah this is the Viktor and Rolf flower
bomb I actually have this perfume myself
and I wear all the time it smells so
freakin good so good it's very strong so
you don't to use too much of it but it
smells wonderful this perfume is really
popular so they came out with this
limited edition bottle for the holidays
and as you can see it's got like
sparkles all over it and it also comes
with a little sparkly flower on the side
and I would have be given this one -
Kristen Dominic she's one of my closest
friends and she loves perfumes it's kind
of her thing I'm 90% sure she doesn't
have this one and if she does I can tell
you darn sure she doesn't have it in
sparkly bottle so I'm definitely gonna
be giving this one to Christine
Dominique next up this is a beautiful
palette this one is from Sephora it's
called
more than me see III should have palette
and as you can see I'll show you in a
minute but it has a lots of colors it's
a $145 value but it's sold for 35 bucks
Packaging is - cycle so the palette
looks like this very Sephora like I love
the gold sparkles it definitely gives
you that holiday feel to it and it comes
with a nice big mirror so that's awesome
and you get 32 eyeshadow shades you get
neutrals which are great for an everyday
look and then you even get smoky look so
you can create quite the combination I
shadow looks because you get such a
variety in color I'm gonna be giving
this one oh I just saw it fold
why is that the cutest thing ever so it
kind of tells you i shadow ideas and
step by step that's so interesting
oh so you fold it down and then close it
and there you go I'm going to be giving
this one to my friend B is for beauty I
think she is such a creative youtuber
and she does the coolest look and she's
always fondling with new eyeshadows so
32 eyeshadows here you go girl
so next is bite Beauty this is a set of
four it says deluxe sample size and this
is going to be their holiday gift sets
got the pretty gold packaging and then
you pull it out and it comes in this
beautiful tin which I would use to keep
like bobby pins rubber bands in whenever
I was finished with it that's just me
throwing a little advice out there and
it comes with a little B for by beauty
you open it and it tells you all the
beautiful colors I love that they're not
all Reds for holiday that it's like a
mixture of neutral colors you can wear
throughout the year and these are pretty
big lipsticks I'm going to be giving
this one to my mom because she is a
lipstick quarter my mom wears lipstick
every single day no matter what and she
wears a colorful lipstick every day
whether it's pink or red or Maroons my
mom it does not hold back on the
lipsticks this nude one she does new one
I just might keep from myself so this is
the bite Beauty perfect bite set and I
think it's so cute and you know what
else I would do sometimes like whenever
I had a normal job and it wasn't you do
whenever I was a medical assistant
I would buy things like this and then
like my four friends at my job I would
just wrap them up cute and give them
each a really nice lipstick it was just
a cute gift in a really affordable way
to give people just an idea you can
break up the gift sets you know and
share the love and maybe keep one for
yourself you guys aren't gonna believe
this next one oh the Dyson super sonic
here she is this is a very cool new
product from Dyson it is their new
intelligent heat control hairdryer it
can protect your hair against extreme
heat damage I personally think this is a
really innovative hairdryer it's so
cool-looking I the Dyson and v9 motor is
on average six times faster one-third of
the way and half the size of other
hairdryer motors so it's just very
innovative is such a cool thing and a
very expression of our special person in
my lavish gonna begin dish one this one
will be my sister she always gets the
real good stuff if I didn't give it to
her and I gave it to someone else my
sister be like where's the hairdryer go
where did it go so this one goes to my
sister she's awesome blossom and I'll
definitely have to get one of these for
myself because oh so good next up I have
the blush bronze and ready to glow
palette this one is by Sephora again
beautiful holiday packaging I love the
spunky pink they put with it this is a
$96 value it's going to be sold for $32
and it's really cute has some info on
the plane so this palette has two
blushes a highlight in a bronzer so you
can just get the full face effect I
think the packaging is even cuter
because this real glitter going on on
the outside and it folds and folds just
like the eyeshadow palettes the same
theme with a nice mirror and then you
get blushes bronzers the whole shebang
this one's definitely go into Manny
anyway he can glow to the gods Manny is
the most like bronzed up glowy like
snatch person alive and I think you
would really appreciate this valid when
you Manny when yeah this is the kissing
up lip set from Sephora and this one is
an $80 value sold for $39 so it comes
with a total of 18 lip glosses sheer
coverage full coverage you get the whole
shebang and quite the variety of color I
think this is a really cool person for a
person in your life that loves the gloss
and my friend Gabriel Zamora his lips
are never fully matte he loves the shine
arm so I think this will be perfect for
Gabrielle's alona hoping out watching
this video because then they're going to
know their Christmas presents next up we
have the NARS audacious lipstick and
this one is in Rita it's very cool
packaging so a special edition for the
holidays is in this matte red packaging

shade in red and I think is absolutely
stunning this is actually a really cute
stocking stuffer so this one I'm
actually decide
to give it someone very special in my
life and it's myself I'm going to keep
