definitely not in my beauty room right
now today's video is going to be a
little bit different today we're going
to be showering together hey guys my
shower routine now I keep it pretty
simple just being honest with you but I
get a lot of questions about products
that I use how I get my glow on how I
shape my leg she's always heard there
but ladies is about to wear all the
bathtub chat happen if you solve a match
how you know what I'm talking about
so without further ado subscribe to my
channel for you even without further ado
let's jump right into the video
well it's been a long time since I've
done a voice over but here we go you're
gonna shower with me and the first thing
I do is be jeweled myself I'm always
wearing lots of jewelry kind of love it
so yeah I take it off and I put it in
this little jar and then I jump right in
the shower and I'm normally not wearing
a swimsuit but obviously I'm wearing it
for privacy purposes so I wet my hair or
whatever reasons I like to shampoo my
hair first right now I'm using an anti
shampoo because I've been wearing my
hair straight often and it really helps
catch those flyaways or helps it from
being too poofy also I use a lot of
products I mean you don't have to do
this I like to use a lot of shampoo
because I like to get it really sexy and
I just like that to my hairs clean
whenever it's all fuzzy I don't only
wash my hair two times a week sometimes
it's a good week I'll wash it three
times out of the week but I like to
scrub my scalp really do whenever I do
wash my hair because I don't watch it
wash it that often and then I do a lot
of rinsing of the hair to make sure
there's no product left in my hair
moving on I've been conditioned my hair
growth to you I use a lot of conditioner
and I mostly concentrate the conditioner
at the ends of my hair versus right at
the root the root of the hair is new
fresh hair so it's already pretty nice
healthy hair the end girl is dry is dry
down there then I let the conditioner
soak in my hair for a while while I wash
my body right now I've been using the
I don't know how to pronounce the bram
but it's just this really smell good
body wash and a loofah and then suds it
all up throw it up the wash my skin I
feel like I do this pretty normally I
don't know how you guys wash your body
but I was kind of wash my body there's
nothing special going on here
I like the loo bugs I do feel like it's
somewhat buff away dead skin so yeah
that's why I loofah it also sometimes I
like to use a body scrub here's one that
I've been loving to scrub off the dead
skin and then I have this little hose
thing which I adore and it just came
with my home that I live in and it
really really really helps to get like a
powerful jet stream and get all that
conditioner out of your hair I don't
know if you guys feel this but sometimes
it's really hard to get all the
conditioner out moving on to shaving I
dry shave my armpits and I've never had
any issues with it I didn't some of you
at home are going to cringe but I do and
for my legs I use conditioner I've
pretty much been doing this for a long
time
conditioner leaves me with so much less
razor burn in any shave gel conditioner
also someone moisturizes the legs as you
shave them because not as harsh but I
think shaving cream just doesn't get the
job done and conditioner is so easy so
yeah I shave my legs and I hate doing it
too lastly in my shower routine I use
the Jergens natural glow wet skin
moisturizer in the shade medium to tan
so this is a genius product so I am
loving this product right now what I
like to do is after I have showered I
turn off the water and while my skin is
still a little bit damp I apply this to
my skin so what I like to do is take a
dime sized amount for both arms and it
glides right on and locks in moisture it
is so easy quick and simple to do and
then as far as my legs I take about a
quarter size amount per leg and just rub
it right in and again your my skin just
feels super super moisturizing I don't
have to add lotion once I get out of the
shower this does not stain your towel so
you don't have to worry about that oh my
god thank goodness and it gives you like
a nice signature flow and another great
tip is to go over the ankle the knees
and elbow areas sparingly with the color
and it starts to appear in about three
to five days
then I dry off like normal let's mount
the shower I'm having dry here but you
definitely don't have to pat dry you can
just dry off like normal and easy peasy
lemon squeezy we are done out of the
shower so if you're wondering why I
didn't wash my face in the shower it's
because I simply do all my skin care
outside the shower and sometimes I
shower in the morning so I'll just wash
my face at night so I thought I would
throw this in we're gonna wash my face
with is the Korres a Greek yogurt face
wash and it's really nice to get all the
excess makeup off my skin so I think
it's really important that you rinse
your skin at least seven times so that
way you're getting all the face wash off
your skin if you leave any place washed
out your skin I definitely think it can
lead to breakout so be sure you're
rinsing your skin very well also I like
to Pat my skin dry rather than rub it
dry rubbing you see a big habit of mine
but I've started to Pat it it's just a
little bit more gentle on your skin so
those are just some tips and then I just
been moisturizing my skin some nice I
use a retinol normally every other night
I'll put a retinol on my skin every
single night I do add a lot of moisture
and I just don't keep my skin routine
very simple as of right now so that's it
for this video guys thank you so much

and I'll see you all in the next video
