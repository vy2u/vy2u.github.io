channel today's video is going to be
testing out something that I found at
Rite Aid and I ran into Rite Aid I don't
remember why I went right aid but of
course I swung through the cosmetic
section and I found these Bailey shear
airbrush cosmetics and they have
literally spray-on primer spray on
salvation spray on bronzer blush
highlight and even concealer what so
it's kind of like airbrush makeup but
it's definitely in a spray can I know
Sephora saw something similar but they
literally have the line up here me even
a highlighter even a face primer so but
girl we are about to review it to see if
it's a hit or a miss now it does look a
little gimmicky you guys knew I was just
waiting to say that word I literally
bought this just so I can say the word
gimmicky in this video well we're just
going to do and hope for the best
also if you're new to my channel be sure
and and we're going to go ahead and jump
right into this video okay I didn't come
by here it's in the ponytail by the way
so first we're going to start off with
the Bailey sheer right on face primer it
says on here is alcohol-free
hypoallergenic hypoallergenic fragrance
free paraben free and water-based now I
love made from water-based makeup
important before you shake bottle for
five seconds here is a close-up of the
faith primer this is three-mississippi
give it a extra shade I want this to
work out um it didn't come in a box or
anything it literally just came in the
bottle kind of gives instructions on the
side shake can hold six to eight inches
away from your face spray light pulses
like not like come here I don't I'm real
nervous a mirror is right here she's
ready to be primed oh nothing happened
nothing happened
girl I'll just make a sign member nothin
oh it's so soft
okay that work is so soft I kind of feel
like my whole face is covered in primer
feels like I sprayed water on my face
it feels like sands on my face kind of
feels like sand interesting I want to
stress on my hand yeah it definitely has
a gritty feel to it let's keep the video
going and go ahead and try their
spray-on foundations they did have a
bunch of different shades this is
breathable buildable and blendable girl
all three be okay I'm going to try and
shade seven I'll test it out on my hand
it just says spray-on foundation and of
course we're going to give it that five
second shape I'm going to try out my
hand whoa she's pink so we're going to
go ahead and try number six I'm a number
six okay here we go
it comes out and such a light mist I'm
not that afraid to use it I'm just
curious how about to get around these
eyebrows and such and around these baby
hairs honey
see anything on my skin kind of hard to
breathe with these because there's so
many fumes happening let's try it looks
like there's nothing on my face but I
could definitely maybe is so hard to do
this video because I'm having trouble
talking to you and spraying this because
I'm in telling it that time we
definitely got some makeup on the skin
you can definitely tell the color from
my face down to my forehead is different
so we definitely have some color on the
skin
my eyelashes have foundation in them
some new trend I feel like even more so
just added a lot of color to my skin it
doesn't it feels a little bit greasy it
doesn't feel heavy it just kind of feels
wet maybe just a little bit I don't hate
the foundation I feel like the can like
I used half the can trying to do my face
you get one fluid ounce of product which
is the average foundation will except
for air flash you get two point three
fluid ounces you get one fluid ounce
let's see and then Mackey at one point
two I don't know I feel like I'm going
to blow through this product and you get
one point 1/2 an ounce so it's not I
don't know it's not so you just not that
much makeup you have to blow so much out
to get it on the skin it did give the
skin color no coverage but color the
girl could you imagine get ready in the
morning you're like all over your face
you're like done oh okay so next this is
oh my gosh all over my nails God's got
my nails done no honey no spray on a
body blemish cover so this is actually a
concealer for your body not your face
excuse me I was wrong next let's go
ahead and move on and try out the
airbrush Cosmetics bronzer it just says
spray-on bronzer says the same thing on
the front of the bottle shake well and
spray it on your face
the thing is it's really hard to keep
your eyes open and spray a product at
your face but yeah you have to see to do
it so little challenging there the
bronzer is kind of hard to to like aim
it and get it like a good area I mean I
am definitely bronze but the bronzer
came out a bit orange I don't know I
don't think there were different shades
but let's keep the party moving and go
on with lush this blush is an apricot
apricot it's hot and you get the same
amount of parts in each can one fluid
ounce they had different blushes at the
Rite Aid but I like the peachy apricot
shade oh let's super super light so
I did that I went into Oh God so you can
use a sponge to erase your mistake Wow
so next we have highlight I'm going to
go over my thoughts about this at the
end by the way but next we have radiant
pearl radiant spray-on is for your legs
and your body and I'm going to add it
just a little bit on the face looking a
little orange okay this can just stopped
working I got one little squirt out and
then it quit spraying nothing but air oh
there goes there goes it kind of gets
like a little bit of a mermaid radiance
is very light and I have a salty bottle
very little pinky this is the finished
look I feel like it could have
potentially been worse let's just spray
on this body concealer anyways because I
feel like we just need to know if it's
something great right brand body blemish
cover whoa Nelly
that is coverage look at that cheese
Louise that is coverage let me give you
a serve you with the truth and my
thoughts and perspective on these I
think they're Dimmick yeah Mickey I do I
think they're a little gimmicky and let
me say that just because I feel like
they're not makeup I feel like they're
spray-painting color on your face and
that's it and with makeup it is a sense
of color but you know you put on like a
Mac foundation where my Make Up For Ever
foundation and you you get this coverage
and this flawless glow and it does so
much more words this is literally just
putting color on your skin there's
definitely not really coverage and you
she really unless you're using the body
blemish
hover and I don't think you get a lot of
product the only thing I could see me
using again is the apricot blush because
it looks really pretty and you can pat
it out with the sponge and I would use
such a little amount of it actually
might like last the bronzer just it's
just so hard to aim it because you're
like blowing like this at your face and
you have to keep your eyes open the one
doing that looks a little difficult
the foundation because I had to use so
much product to cover my face with I
could not breathe because fumes were
everywhere and I couldn't imagine how
like your bathroom sink and always look
after spraying this just being practical
and the face primer felt like sand on my
face so girl that was a no from me so
overall these are poop for me um the
only one I like just the blush and think
that could be a doable situation but
comment down below as I always ask you
guys to do comment down below your
thoughts would this work for you I
believe these were how much were these
it shows that these are so at Walmart 10
bucks I think they're a little more just
because they were at Rite Aid so they're
not that expensive they're not the
cheapest thing in the world but they're
not that expensive and I think it would
be kind of hard to find your foundation
color because mine's too orange just
because you have to like look at this
picture which the pit oh I like that
color on the bottle is kind of far from
what the actual color is but I
personally am NOT gonna like suggest you
guys go out and get these but I hope you
did enjoy my review of it was somewhat
entertaining I'll see you with my that's
a wrap people
oh there's the real Laura
oh that's orange all the things that new
for the internet I hope you guys love me
I sure hope you guys love me because I
do love you I do
ok we're done here I'm just rambling
we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
