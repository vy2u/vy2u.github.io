today's video is going to be testing out
the vamp stamp it's a stamp for winged
eyeliner give the interesting video you

see your own thoughts about it but
really quick I wanted to tell you guys
here is the winner of the to Mexico's
pros that I was giving away and also

doing the biggest makeup giveaway I have
ever done the rolls and all will be
under the picture super easy to enter so
head under to lolly on Instagram and
enter to win allows the makeup and lots
of winners own talent scattered brain in
this intro aren't I always though I saw
this and I thought well what a cool
thing to test out for you guys and I
actually got in the mail while ago and
I'm just now getting to film with it
because my week is been so crazy it is
um yeah it's like a metal tool to rubber
ends and it has these little arrows you
just like and get perfect liner but just
watch the video okay hmm
and subscribe to my channel pause you
think today let's jump right in and get
started alright guys so know we're all
close to the person I want to go ahead
and get started and test out this little
van stamp booger to me at the perfect
winged liner so it says the struggle for
the perfect wing ends here conquer this
concrete and make it technique with
minimal effort it says it allows for eye
food imperfect wing minor look so
immediately up pure makeup Chris chose
in the picture that she went ahead and
just do regular liner I just on the
little wing the wing is obviously the
most difficult part I think in wing
liner not per se the liner across the
lid I didn't get like any specific
instructions other than just knowing to
stamp it I don't think I did and I
probably wouldn't read the instructions
that they did give me any specific
instructions because I'm Laura there are
two types of peoples in the world or the
people that read the instructions to do
every single detail before they test out
something
this is people like me who just dives
right in comment down below and let me
know what type of person I'm going to be
using this little nyx matte liquid liner
right here
no one is pretty simple and then i just
kind of like made it cut off at the end
so we can get the damn stamp up in there
I have one my favorite gel liner this is
some morphe gel liner in Slate and I'm
just going to paint the end of the brush
with it I'm going to kind of dip it in
there and then paint in the brush just
making sure ample amount of product is
on here I'm kind of nervous I don't want
to do this up so to assume you would
just go exist okay so I'm pressing you
see that oh oh no let me add way more
product okay now I assure you there's
like globs of miner on this and
basically I'm just going to try again I
think that was my fault honestly that I
just didn't have a product here ago I
did press kind of hard and you know what
it's not bad because what I would do now
which wouldn't be difficult it should
take the little liner brush
I think I'm not obsessive this little
tip is a little blunt I think it's
because it didn't press down hard enough
oh that didn't fix it and that was kind
of sort of so I wanted that to work let
me try the left side okay fully loaded
I'm going to like latch that little end
piece right there
oh one more time oh okay okay I want to
try again over here I'm gonna wiped off
all the mess I put a lot more liner I
mean I don't know if you can you tell I
just dipped it in my gel eyeliner I just
I don't see liquid liner working on this
sewage dry so fast I wonder I want to
figure this out you know oh oh damn I
stamped it on the wrong end let me take
this I off now what we're going to try
liquid liner now just going to take that
next liner and paint the edge liquid
liner has to be what I'm missing here
it's got to be liquid liner that you use
huh that's it
all right ready it's like the liquid
liner dried a little too quick so let me
do one more stamp
honestly this is becoming like a lot oh
I feel like I could have done 18 winged
liners right now but let me try again
it's like bubbling up with liquid liner
have so much product on it okay that so
it's messy but like that was our most
successful run so we're going to do that
to the right side we're going to wipe
off this mess I mean I said this is a
learning experience together really
trying to figure this thing out together
and hope you're with me on this really
fully loaded I'm gonna do it quickly
boom oh my god that looks so bad
thank God liquid liner is really easy to
ice ball source this gel liner outer
corners of my eyes are a little bit raw
now I have no makeup on this area now
and I'm going to let it you know dry
100% obviously and then I'm going to try
the liquid one more time I mean I'm
going to go ahead and say like I'm not
really recommending this like hell if
you have a hard enough time with liquid
liner just is making my life hard with
lip liner and I feel like I you know
have got it down pretty Pat but actually
this is making my life more difficult so
I don't know it would be easier at home
I'm just at this point trying to make it
work alright I ready said and boom baby
this is what I would do is I was left
with this little monstrosity on my eye
oh go ahead oh that just looks wing it
out and then I would take a little call
that it's not that great of a wing but
I'm trying that's what I would do to fix
it so I don't know if this would be more
so a good tool to kind of guide you and
you can kind of tap in and fixing the
rest of it I don't know maybe that's it
I still lost okay guys my overall
experience with this is definitely not
worth your time try it out with my
morphe liner and my freakin bro gel
liner I tried it out with liquid liner I
tried it on with makeup on my eye I
tried it with no makeup on my I'm a bear
skin okay this is my repaired liner this
one's okay this one is just she's seen
better days
a little bit much for me you know it's
not worth all the trouble I feel like
I've missed you to my subscribers before
