video is a collab video with Mayra
touches limb here on YouTube her summer
essentials video is going to be up and
the link will be in the description box
be sure to check around she's been a
great friend to me here on the YouTube
world for a long time it is also a
collab with the beauty bird or just
Ebert really this is jazz me you guys
are probably familiar with her I love
her channel she's also gonna have her
video up and of course that link will be
right in the description box so be sure
to subscribe to both of them and check
out their videos we're gonna get started
with my summer essentials the first
thing is sunglasses which is a must I
can't even drive my car without
sunglasses on it hurts my eyes so much
so I have a collection of weird
sunglasses the ones I'm wearing are from
Aldo there were only $10
oh and actually the ones I'm holding up
we're also from Aldo there are only $10
so Aldo has really good sunglasses for a
cheap price and they are quite original
I'm nothing
alright the next one is going to be a
highlight I love the glow I just did
squirrel on strobing yo girl get y'all
glow wall
okay anyways my favorite is Becca
cosmetics champagne pop hey girl hey
Jacqueline hill I see you asking you and
also the Becca cosmetics Opel is another
favorite of mine and I also like Mac
Chelle
there's like a bazillion how I'd said
I'm obsessed with it you guys know that
next it's going to be hats you guys
protect your face from the Sun I mean it
you better protect your face from the
Sun huh even though has don't fill my
head the first hat is a fedora and I
noticed more West Coasters like the
fedoras and my southern or East Coasters
like them ball cap and this is won by
polo my Fedora is from forever 21 it was
like ten dollars and I think this polo
cap with only 18 sup cute cups or cute
little things to drink out of I got
these cups from Target I think they're
the cutest thing in the world I love
drinking of them look at me look at me
Laura stop anyways um they're like a
dollar fifty and they meant great for a
summer party next it's gonna be fake
Tanner you guys you don't need to lay on
the Sun and bake your skin or if you
just want a little bit of an extra glow
this Sally Hansen airbrush legs will do
the trick
it's actually like makeup on your legs
i'ma so it's like an instant tan and
it's gonna cover up any imperfections so
I really like it because yes I have
spider veins on the side of my legs why
me but I do and I use this to cover them
up and it works really well and I am in
medium love ok so just give me a minute
to do some weird stuff to the camera and
we will be right back to the programming
and next is body spray so I found this
cool body spray and I think Walmart is
from secret and it's like a deodorant
body spray and I know in the summer time
we'd be working I'll be laying out by
the pool sweat and sank in so this is
really gonna help eliminate the odor and
it's like a perfume body spray as well
mixed together it's by secret and
eucalyptus eucalyptus blossom I can't
say that next is gonna be sunscreen and
I found a really good face sunscreen and
actually came in a goodie bag it's from
bear Republic and it's an
natural mineral sunscreen for your face
at least wear your sunscreen in SPF 30
my favorite one for my body is the
Neutrogena Beach defense and that is an
SPF 30 as well but the fair one is the
balm for the face next is a hydration
mist that I have been obsessed with and
this is my first day Beauty this is a
vitamin hydration myth I like to put
this in a cooler or the fridge and get
it really cold and spray it all over me
mom outside or getting hot it feels so
good you can spray it on night down a
morning time bedtime girl you just put
it on whenever you want to and that is
it for my summer essentials I hope you

thumbs up if you did and be sure to
