today's video is going to be testing out
viral Instagram products that you've
seen over and over and over on Instagram
and you have to wonder like does it
really work is it just gimmick doback
you know I love thing that works does
anyone say that word no probably not
okay cool
one or two I've tried out before and I
really liked them so I thought to be
worth sharing them with you in this
video and the other ones I haven't tried
out at all and I'm excited to see if
they work or not a lot of them I just
wanna whose beauties page now hey yo yo
yo got product that product that product
like I knew I knew the T so huda beauty
is notorious for posting like the most
viral videos or she makes them Beryl
herself actually met her and a Marc
Jacobs event and she would be sweetest
most down-to-earth person and so we're
gonna be testing out a couple of her
products that are new in this video as
well if you haven't already be sure and
subscribe to my channel before you leave
so crap dad I oh crack myself up and
we'll go ahead and jump right into the
video
- shave my armpit
the first product we're going to try out
is a patch ology and I know you guys
have seen needs oh man I think I got the
wrong one these are eye gel eyes so I
got the lip ones we're going to try the
gel eyes because I mean the lip limit in
the eyes or lips grilles are all over
the internet so it looks like it's kind
of hard to see because they are white
look at that goog louche I think that's
too much there's like a bazillion of
them in this pack - OH stripping gel
okay let's try them I want to mess up my
hair oh here we go
Destin on backwards I put it on
backwards
okay cool we've already spelled how to
be an instagramer 101 is what this video
should be titled
I'm like breaking it on the edge there
oh man these are not as easy as it looks
but I do like the way that this feels
now there's like hair on it
this is what happens when you're a hairy
beast and you have there's hair all over
this one I can't that one's going in the
trash oh I'm gonna go get my nails done
today by the way so you can stop looking
at my plane now
oh that one went on so much easier I got
the hang of it you know mlpro now I have
some lip one time out to go fine and
we're gonna try the lip ones too cool I
can't find my lip arms I guess I must
like a bad Instagrammer do you feel
really menthol we they've been on for a
good minute I think I'm gonna take them
off I think I'm gonna take them off they
feel like you know holux have you ever
put a cucumber on your eye they feel a
lots of gel I'm just going to moisturize
it in it feels good no doubt I don't see
like a significant difference that they
did select the menthol I feel which
would help with the bags but at least
there is moisture under my eyeballs okay
moving right along let's go ahead and
try like the world's most famous
Instagram product farce Ollie unicorn
essence now they have three of these I
have all three but this is the most
popular one I don't know if these are
sponsored post on Instagram or if people
just like to use them for their thumb
nails on Instagram or if they genuinely
love the products and there's no T
against sponsorships on Instagram I've
done sponsorships on Instagram so I'm
going to be using the uniform one which
like I said seems to be the most popular
patty because it says the word unicorn
on it I think anything it's a unicorn
pretty much goes viral because we all
just want to be a unicorn inside okay so
I'm going to apply it how they apply it
has directions to apply to a clean
moisturized face you can use it as a
primer okay I'm going to shake it
actually here she goes
it's pink I'm just trying to show it to
you so if you guys can see it's just
dripping all over my desk but I just
want to show you that it's pink I want
to show you what it looks like close up
that's eyeliner on this finger I was
cleaning out my drawer and eyeliner
grabbed my finger and I didn't clean it
so great is what I've seen is true
- like a little unicorn tear it smells
good um okay let me tell you something
that I'm liking actually about this
product it doesn't feel heavy at all it
doesn't like an OL it's not like an OL
it feels like almost like a liquid
setting spray if that makes sense my
face feels extremely moisturized this is
not sponsored by the way and you can
tell it's a little tacky it's not like
slippery and greasy which I kind of
thought that these were going to be so
it kind of feels like I prep my skin
before my makeup I would also like just
to fill these I would also add a dot
into my foundation if it was really
cakey or hard to blend out so far I like
this product so let's add a foundation
on top I'm going to use the LA girl I
really like this one it's ten bucks this
is the pro foundation I'm going to use
the best brush on the planet Earth a y6m
morphe and I'm going to go ahead and
apply this onto my skin and just see oh
you see like the luminosity and like
girl I'm not mad at these I kind of see
maybe people aren't sponsored maybe
there's really good drops I don't know
my skin literally looks flawless right
there I just feel super super
moisturizing so if you don't need that
extra extra extra moisture maybe these
might not be the greatest for you but I
just feel like my skin looks so healthy
fresh plush and glowy
okay well we'll see how it wears but as
far as like right now I like it a lot
so we're going to move on next we're
going to go ahead and test out the cake
and bake beauty sponge this was done in
collaboration with an instagramer I
believe and I've seen it floating around
for a while on Instagram this was sent
to me I've never even opened it out of
the box because I really wanted to debut
it in some type of video I'm like Hello
the perfect video Annie I know adores
the sponge he uses it all the time on
camera off camera so Manny it better be
good it better be good I'm calling you
out so I need a wet it but as of right
now it does feel really plush and soft
which that's already a good sign you
ever get a sponge is like
so breaking soda the wallet slogan
meanie literally just text me when I
said his name it's so weird
let me go wet it and I'll be right back
my glam times has out these products in
order so I can be applying my makeup
this is the just in case you guys are
wondering if you can still earn now this
is one of my tried-and-true drugstore
concealers I remember starting my
channel using this the only thing I
hated about this concealer like you
don't go that much product I don't know
why it's like it burned through this
concealer so fast but I like it a lot in
general it's absolutely fabulous so here
goes the sponge I wet it and like as you
can see it's really big now and it's
extra extra soft so I'm kind of really
excited to try it out huh I'm not mad at
the sharp corners see how can you like
get really close up you guys are like
cool you're jabbing your eye out and
then snatch that nose oh okay so it
feels like it feels weird it doesn't
still like a Beauty Blender it
definitely has a weird of feel to it
doesn't have that balance really it's
kind of it's not stiff but it doesn't
like have that Beauty Blender balance
but as alicia's is soft
that's the Beauty Blender so it's
definitely different I don't think I was
going to enjoy this as much as I am
enjoying it right now I'm not gonna lie
I'm not mad about it I actually like
this sponge it's a little awkward to
hold at first but like I don't know it
blended out my make it really good and
it was soft those are important things
and it get the angles it's just kind of
like oh if that makes any sense now I'm
going to go ahead and add some setting
powder with it this is the Too Faced
Born This Way setting powder I've really
been enjoying lately see that's what
that angle is probably like the best for
you know like what added a lot of powder
over here that's okay that's okay
she's gonna really bake today so next
I'll do this which I just can't imagine
how good that's going to be because oh
that sharp corner just up but I have to
contour her and I want to put the powder
on and then add the cream contour
because we have a little product to try
out okay the next product I'm going to
tell you about is the product I
absolutely adore and you see me use it
before my channel the lord have mercy
I've use eboo qoodles on instagram as
has anyone in there mom it's only right
for me to
this guy in this video this is the
artiste brush you're looking at the oval
number seven here's the kicker with
these these are the softest version of
these brushes that you can buy but they
are expensive a.f they're expensive but
they work and they last and they're easy
to clean the kicker is they definitely
have dupe versions which are incredibly
cheaper look how quick I just blended
that out by barely touching my face and
your product goes a little bit longer
with these two it doesn't absorb as much
product because the bristles are so
dense they're just like 60 to 70 dollars
each and it's hard for me to like keep
using that on my channel and not give
any affordable option wears like a
morphe brush is going to be four dollars
three dollars up to ten dollars you know
so that's why I tend to use my other
brushes and I love them so much these
are awesome now they do have dupes now
let me tell you about the dupes because
I've tried the tubes and the dupes are
great they pretty much do the same thing
there are an incredible amount cheaper
there is not nearly as soft but if you
do want these just know they work and
they're fabulous and you will love them
I'm going to pick a second one I'm just
a bigger oval tin you can even use them
the sweeper wood powder one swipe
they're all over Instagram and I wanted
to kind of give you guys the tea on them
next up we are going to go ahead and try
to now um carve out you bum cheek with
our beautiful - baked sponge oh my god
how perfect
yeah I'm digging this lunge especially
if you're a baker and like you're like
not the cake baker but like you bake I
think this is even better for baking
than it is for cream product just
because it's a little awkward to hold to
blend out cream product although it does
it pretty much flawlessly we go you can
cut those corners with this bad boy I
really like this and I approve it I like
it a lot I didn't think it would but I
do all right while we're baking another
product I know you guys have seen across
the internet and I've used these before
these are the iconic London illuminator
drops these are interesting little
boogers but there's there's a lot of
version of these out there but I think
like these in the cover up excellent are
probably the
most are you guys ready for me get the
liner out of my finger but they are the
most ahh
pigmented let me show you how I enjoy
using them okay so I put it on the back
of my hand always and then I've been
taking my why 14 brush it's just a
little highlighting brush it looks like
this and if you can see like the
bristles are really nice they're almost
like sparse kabuki bristles instead of
using my 36 brush which is a little bit
more wispy and the bristles are more
soft instead of kabuki like or more
raspy as you said than kabuki like so
then I'll just swirl the brush on the
hand oh these are like gag-worthy here's
the kicker with these they are a cream
product obviously but I find that they
work really well on top of the powder
which is odd and it's rare but they're
still really beautiful and they're easy
to use I do apply these pretty much in
the coverfx ones all over my body
whenever I'm like out by the pool or
going to the beach they're just really
pretty and I love the way they wear I
know that like liquid highlighters can
be a little bit tricky to use and people
are little less susceptible to using
them so let me show you the huda beauty
highlighting palette it's a brand new
one no I haven't tried this one yet this
is our summer highlight palette and this
is what it looks like yes good yes one
all right the top one is cream in the
rest are like arid essent powder that is
the cream one and then these are the
powder ones and they're extremely creamy
wet filling very pigmented
alright I'm really wanting to try all of
them all over my body and face so let's
do the body - oh let's do purple in the
body
woah my brush is purple okay do you see
how it's like the most faint purple I
know sometimes you scare people but girl
oh so pretty okay let me add some pink
on this shoulder we're just going crazy
that's okay actually I am this - oh this
one's more pink for sure like you can
tell oh these are really cool now I'm
going to add some Malibu on top of
our wet highlight it's really pretty
that's in that oml who I think is the
most blinding out of the whole pack like
a true Instagram draw I am bling in girl
we are this video is kind of weird but
we are trying out some stuff today next
I have this shot and now this is like
old school Instagram I see these are on
Instagram or look house except rated as
a bottom but I mask we do some L I think
these are by glitter injections who is a
sign doesn't say the brand on the little
thing this is from the House of beauty
it's called glow top and it shows people
putting it on their bottle ahh body and
it's $14 so I guess my body is taking it
again I'm going to take off the thing I
feel like a makeup surgeon over here
let's see what happens
oh she's sick okay is super super super
sticking like crazy like whoa whoa Nelly
okay here I go okay it's pretty though
oh yes let's put some down the arm okay
yeah that's really pretty and like
sparkly and it like sticks to your skin
I'm not going to lie it was not looking
pretty in here like it was like
separating and looking kind of gross but
okay alright I don't hate it it's pretty
like it just leaves this pretty shimmer
on your body and the thing is it's not
sticky at all it's so completely dry and
it sticks to your body what is that
could you imagine this all over your
lives and stuff in the summer yeah now
these are all over Instagram these are
the new who - Beauty lips robes I have a
couple popular colors here I really want
to try out like this bright one without
anything on now these can be used as a
whip topper I'm mostly seeing them being
used as a lip topper this one is in
shade shameless let's see what happens
it's really cool-looking I feeling my
life are a little bright let me swatch
out my hand so you can see but it looks
really cool on the lips how it's brown
but like what the light hitting is got a
cool aired essence really pretty so
these were like really thin filling but
they're not sin at all my stomach is
growling girl she's ready for life oh my
good and now I'm going to try on one of
the new go to beauty summer edition like
the lipsticks which again of course this
one is jet setter but of course these
are all over the internet and I'm going
to put it on and then we're going to add
the topper such a pretty color and it's
a really pretty summer color I really
want to add this umm purpley one over it
because it looks so cool alright this is
pretty much dry are you guys ready for
the purple oh haha she was like myself
