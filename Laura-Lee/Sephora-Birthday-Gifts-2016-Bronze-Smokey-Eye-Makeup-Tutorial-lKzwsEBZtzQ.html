video is going to be this bronzer makeup
look with a pink lip I feel like I'm
getting ready for spring over here
especially with this like I don't know
like this is like a housecoat but it's
not I promise
for the lips I use this Marc Jacobs the
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang 216 lipstick which
is a really pretty pink color I am
sharing these products with you because
these are the new birthday gifts for the
Sephora beauty insider members if you
are not a beauty insider why not today
I'm going to share with you the two
gifts you get to choose from from
Sephora for the birthday gift if you are
a beauty insider and normally there is
only one gift so this year you get to
choose from one of two different gifts
so Beauty be obedient I remember is free
all you do is go in Sephora sign up or
you can sign up online and you get a
free birthday gift so this year's gifts
are either one of the two you can get
the Marc Jacobs Beauty insider which
comes with the lipstick kits Kiss Bang
Bang and their eyeliner which let me
tell you we've talked about this
eyeliner a hundred times on my channel
its dimension in favorites video this is
the only eyeliner I've ever found - oops
- stay in the waterline like it will not
budge it will last all day
best eyeliner ever and not only that my
favorite thing about it is that it rolls
up and that way you don't have to
sharpen it that's the Marc Jacobs set
and then we have the fresh set of choose
from this comes with a cleanser and a
mask so the soil soil is sweet cleanser
it looks like this and if you're just
wondering what the cleanser looks like
it's like a clear creamy gel and it's
very gentle on the skin so amazing for
removing makeup and it's not gonna over
dry out your skin and you also get the
mask with it which is an amazing mask
that this mask actually hydrates and
toned your skin and it's infused with
real rose petals and I'll do a close-up
of what it looks like so you can have a
peek at that because I think it looks so
interesting so this is a perfect map
especially for the winter time because
our skin gets extra dry so these two are
amazing combo as well as the Marc Jacobs
said I think they're amazing so this is
a birthday gift and if you're a beauty
inside
a month of your birthday you can go in
there whenever you buy something little
dinky little bell goatee yes and no let
everybody know it's your birthday I've
had a meeting inside it for a long time
as you can see then you can pick a free
gift so it's amazing also there is vib
and that's whenever you get moved up
from Beauty Insider to a VIP and that's
whenever you spend three hundred and
fifty dollars and there a year or I am
guilty of being the vib Rouge and that
is whenever you spend a thousand dollars
in there a year and honestly my favorite
thing would be a beauty insider every
hundred dollars you spend you get a
hundred points and so you get a free
little gift every time or you can save
up to five hundred dollars and save all
your points I did that in the last time
I got like a Bobbi Brown Skin Care set
it was crazy they have really good gift
so I recommend signing out I just wanted
to share with you the 2016 birthday
gifts they're amazing we're gonna jump
right in and get started be sure to give
the video a thumbs up before you leave
hey guys starting out I already primed
my skin and add it my foundation using
the Make Up For Ever HD we're gonna be
using the target in blue palette for the
eyes today first we'll start off with
smarty pants and this is just a light
brown transition color and I'm just
gonna pop that into the crease very
lightly this look is gonna be a lot more
simple than my past looks I know they
get a little complicated I'm sorry
next we're gonna go in with jet setter
which is like basically the same brown
just a wee bit deeper and we're just
gonna build it up then going in with
rebel and doing the exact same thing
adding it right on top of jet setter and
blending it into the crease you get a
nice gradient look whenever you build up
multiple colors so then I'm gonna go in
with this beautiful like brick bert
color called later I did a bad job in
describing that and I'm gonna pop that
right into the crease on top of the
other colors I'm using just a very small
amount of color because I don't want
this look to be too dramatic then this
is my favorite part I'm gonna go in with
firecracker and I'm gonna press this
onto the lid I'm not blending it I'm
just like smoothing it out like butter
on
my lid butter now that we're done
talking about food this is a synthetic
brush and I find that these brushes are
the best brushes to do the lid color
lastly I'm going to take activists which
is a matte chocolatey brown color I'm
gonna pop it into the outer corner and
then I'm going to take whatever is left
on that brush and start pushing it
forward
throughout the crease just because I
want most of the focus of the dark brown
color to be on that outer corner and
just softly blend it inward and then
you're pretty much done with your eyes
besides some mascara and if you don't
want to do false lashes you don't have
to I'm gonna add some false lashes
because you know I love the drama but if
you don't want to you can just simply
build up your favorite mascara by the
way these are Lana by huda beauty lashes
then I'm gonna go in with the Marc
Jacobs eyeliner I'm gonna top line this
is just gonna help everything blend
together with those false lashes and
that little inner corner with the false
lashes ends I'm gonna go ahead and fill
that in and with a darker color just
again so everything looks nice and
blended together and then we're gonna
work on the face a little bit I'm gonna
go in with my Urban Decay Naked
concealer and medium light and I will
highlight my face and then I'll blend
all of that out with a Beauty Blender
Beauty Blender I know once all that is
blended out like in every tutorial I'm
gonna go in with my Laura Mercier
translucent setting a powder I'm gonna
push that on to the under eye where I
added that concealer and what this is
gonna do is help it to be creaseless and
full lawless and leaking I know I'm just
making it words now but really this
trick does make your under eyes that
look fabulous I'm gonna let leave that
setting there and I'm gonna go in with
my honest I'll show Beverly Hills
contouring kit I'm gonna do a little bit
of contouring nothing too crazy I'm
gonna do it around the jawline I did it
underneath my cheekbone I'm gonna bring
it up around the temple area just areas
the Sun naturally hits and just kind of
shading at my face
then I'm gonna take this nice soft brush
I'm going to sweep away any excess
powder that was left adding there next
I'll go in with rocket or blush by
benefit and I'm gonna pop this right
onto the apples of my cheeks and just to
give us a little bit of a glow I'm gonna
be going in with a champagne pop buy
back of cosmetics this is the
collaboration with Jaclyn hill you guys
are like why are you telling me this I
already know this Laura okay so I'm just
gonna add that to the high points of the
cheekbones down the nose into the upper
lip then I will go back in with that
first color that we used that first
light matte brown color I'm gonna sweep
that from the inner to the outer corner
on the lower lash line and then I will
go in with the bronze color and do the
exact same thing and then I'm going to
add a little bit of this Marc Jacobs
liner into my waterline how could I not
this is the best liner for your
waterline hear me believe me it is next
wouldn't go I don't know why I did that
crazy face but I added this pink
lipstick Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from Marc
Jacobs in the birthday set and I hope
you guys enjoyed the look thank you for
being here don't forget to sign up for

hope to see you all in my next video bye
