today's video is going to be it's a four
haul I went shopping it's been a long
time since I actually Linda's Sephora
and picked up a bunch of stuff that I've
really been wanting to try before we
start the video can we just talk about
this little cuteness oh we adopted a new
baby kitten from the animal shelter and
we don't know what the name is yet but
we'll know soon you guys tweeted me some
awesome names I'm looking at room right
now but she's my new little baby and I
love him anyway it's back to the makeup
we're just gonna dig right in this bag
and I'm gonna show you guys all of my
goodies um so yeah yeah
before the video get started I just
wanted to say be sure to follow me on
all my social media before you leave I
got Twitter Instagram Facebook snapchat
I know I've got all kinds of good stuff
okay that way we can be connected more
and we can chat more and we can be best
friends forever
okey anyways oh stop blabbing and we'll
get started so uh yeah if you want to
see this in the baggie well then just
keep watching all right Holly
what's up the paper Oh something that I
am pretty excited about okay
it's gonna be a long video I think I'm
pretty excited about is our glass came
out with their ambien light palette with
the three different shades in it but it
looks like I don't know if this is new
or not that I just saw it at the little
mini section when you check out it
always gets me I'm like okay I'm done
shopping I'm spinning up and then I get
to that section and everything is like
literally jumping in my basket on it so
much I don't know how it happens but it
does this was in that section
this is dim light is the name of it and
it's like a little bitty mini one it's
so pretty so I never had the full
palette and it's $60 so I'm always
contemplating on getting it so I got
just the one shade that I really wanted
and it's just the most subtle nice
daytime glow and I'm in love so again
this is dim light by hourglass very
excited about the product I think this
one was 27 no this one was 22 it's the
same size and it's a lot cheaper than
$60 so and I got the one I wanted
okay next product I got was a liquid
lipstick as if I don't have enough
liquid lipsticks but then this color
stuck out to me I don't know if it's a
new one or not when it's like have on
date and I really like this shade of it
I just think it's a different type of
shade of liquid lipstick that I haven't
really seen before is light pink but it
almost has like grey and it's a very
cool toned strange looking liquid
lipstick the only other one of these
everlasting liquid lipsticks that I have
is Jeffrey and I'm just obsessed with it
so I thought I would give another one a
try and I just think that little guy
the next product I got is something from
Bobby Brown Bobby Brown is not a big
section for me to shop in I've never
been just like overly obsessed with the
products from Bobby Brown that I just
had to have them one product did stick
out to me this is one of their shimmer
bricks and this one is in Sunset pink
and again it was just calling my name I
mean what are you gonna be whenever
something is screaming your name you're
gonna go to it so I did it looks like
this I mean it's pretty nice big fat
juicy packaging here whoa reminds me a
little bit of the Laura Mercier's pink
mosaic think this one has just a little
bit more of Browns and light shades in
them I don't know it comes off just a
little bit more of a stronger color cuz
whenever i swatched it all together in
the store i noticed that and i was like
hey i'm gonna give it a try so i picked
this up it was a little pricey
I mean it's Bobby Brown what do you
expect but the Oh was 46 so it's not the
end of the world because this is a
really nice palette but next I got
something from makeup forever that I've
been wanting since that's how I come out
I don't even know if I got the right
shade I just got really excited whenever
I saw and I was like okay mine I got
shade 20 M and this is one of their new
pro bronze infusions and the packaging
just sells me on this one I love that
it's not their typical black packaging
they actually put this like bronze
copper thingamabob on the top so pretty
also the pattern on the bronzer is just
to die for
and I also had their pro duo with the
highlight and the bronzer and I really
like the bronzer on those
I figured I like the bronzer on this
bronzer bronzer bronzer how many times
can say the word bronzer looks pretty I
think 20 M is gonna work for me I just
grabbed one cuz I was like honestly I
just don't know how you know you somehow
she just got a grab one and go with it
pray for the best
next time I picked up is from a first
aid beauty this is their ultra Repair
mineral sunscreen moisturizer cream
moisturizer moisturizer with SPF if 40
you know what whenever I say the word
Smith everybody freaked out I mean last
time they're like it's SPF she said
stuff guys
work at the derm and we had to say SPF
so much we start start calling us to get
it SPF v do you get it to give it I'm
doing now no okay
oh this is not my everyday like a
hydrant but I really like this for my
face when going out into the Sun summers
just getting started here I know we're
getting all into this back-to-school
manage the Sun it's not going anywhere
in the beautiful state of California
it's up still gonna have a sunscreen for
our face I really like this one because
there's a mineral sunscreen so it
doesn't clog the pores and it protects
your skin wash next I got some Thurmond
cover-up eggs and I don't typically ever
buy something like this but I did and
we're gonna see what happens this is
their total cover creme foundation and
in 40 like I always buy liquid
foundations it looks light on camera but
it looks pretty dark over here so I
wanna try something different I mean I
have the qoodles of liquid foundations
and I just want to see what happens with
this I've heard nothing but good things
from everything from cover effect and as
far as the liquid drops those are
amazing to mix with sefar foundation I
just really like her oh thanks so I want
to explore more into that brand and
that's why I picked these up and again
in 44 min see what happens with this I'm
gonna be trying it out you may see it in
a video if you don't maybe I didn't like
it I don't know that um yeah I'm gonna
try it out we're gonna see what happens
I mean who knows I mean love it huh okay
so the mini section up front got me
again this is the origins clear
Improvement Act active charcoal mass to
clear pores so I kind of sort of may
have bought this for Tyler he doesn't
know that and I kind of bought it for me
too but he has the biggest poured
they get dirty so I always try to
experiment and do things to his poor
little face a little brooch on a peep
out and get a show I try to do things to
help him out with that and he's a
trooper he's like go for it he's gonna
kill me if he sees this video and I'm
telling you guys this charcoal mass
which is supposed to be really good to
help clean out this pores I'm am gonna
use it on myself too because I've
noticed some blackheads building up and
they need to get the heck out of here
okay next I picked up a blush from
Sephora which I don't know if I'm gonna
keep because it's a forest lining and
look like the prettiest peach color and
then I got home and it's just as pink as
it can possibly be and I have nine
million bushes that look just like this
and so I don't think I'm gonna keep it
but it's sweet on you and in the stores
lighting I swear to guys it looked like
the prettiest peach blush ever and then
I got home and I was like know who else
I got something I love from Marc Jacobs
I love their twinkle pop shadow sticks I
have one of them already and I did a
tutorial with it many many moons ago
like that video might be a little bit
rusty but these are so cool because
whenever you apply them to your eyelid
they're like cold they're very cold so
this is a twinkle pop I got it in honey
bunny which is the champagne pretty
color I wanted to give something like
more colorful and not a neutral shade
but i swatched them all across my hand
in the store was like which one am I
going to get today decided and then this
one stuck out the most to me and I was
like dang it I know many of the neutral
and Laura why do you always get the
neutral one Oh Here I am with honey
bunny which is like the most neutral one
they have do I get a thumbs ever being
weird um these are really cool they're
just cream eyeshadow sticks and I like
to use them as a base for eyeshadows but
these are so pigmented you swipe these
all over your eyelid and use them as
your eye shadow of the day and rock
and roll oh uh but weird I don't want
I'd normally typically wouldn't buy but
I maybe it was impulse I don't know
but make up forever recently sent me one
of their liners which I had never tried
before and I loved it in plain black so
I went out on a whim and it got one that
is black with a little bit of sparkle to
it because I really like the one they
sent me so I was like hey I'll try a
different one then you know
so this one is it just says number two
let's see aqua liner number two so this
is just number two no funky name they
like to keep it professional over there
and make it forever
it's a really cool liner the brush
actually isn't that easy to create a
wing with but the consistency of the
product and the formula is actually
really good and liner so that's what it
arced me to get another one I do wish
they had a little bit more of a longer
brush to help get that flick but this
brush is a little bit short and stiff so
I'm gonna have to work with it a little
bit but I wanted to do something fun and
cool and out of the norm so I just got
this little bunny okay and then lastly
from the little 500 perks points I never
have anything good and I'm always just
might mean finally I saw something I
thought would be worth my points this is
the bow shows their little black mask
kit and let's see what all we get
because I haven't even always hit the
kit and he didn't even flinch um let's
see what came in here you know cuz I
don't even know so this is the cutest
thing ever it's like a mini little black
mask and I have this one in the big size
and it has lasted me forever amen
I also got a little poor strip I'm
probably use this on time and I got the
detoxifying a black cleanser okay I'm
gonna be using this on me I'm really
excited about it I've always wanted to
use their black cleanser and it's here
so I'm gonna be trying that and then I
got there revitalizing black hydrogen
okay so this is I get some moisturizing
gel and I'm gonna be using this on me to
you because I love gel moisturizer so
much you're having problems with your
pores being clogged up and you're like I
don't know why but I applied cream all
over my face
that might be the culprit at the
dermlite
any acne pictures we had that had dealt
with all the skin and big pores switch
over to that gel moisturizer because
typically they are normally water-based
where's your cream lens a normally old
base so yeah yeah there's just a little
tip for you right there and that's all I
got so yeah that's a good trip to
support I hope you guys enjoy this video
