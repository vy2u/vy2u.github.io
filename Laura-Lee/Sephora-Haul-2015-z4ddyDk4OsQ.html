video is going to be a Sephora haul I
got a lot of goodies from Sephora and I
was gonna do a haul video because I've
been hauling a lot lately but I snapchat
and you guys be like yes let's do this
hop over wow what are you taking Lauren
it's a sport huh I'm really excited to
share these goodies with you because I
picked up a lot of items that are new I
don't know why I froze huh
I've tried really hard not to use the
product until I shall see that way
they're all new and fresh I've been
guilty to doing that in the past and
then swimming back in the box and
Virginia like I didn't use them like
they're all new and fresh and they
really have been used hope you guys are
excited we're gonna jump right in and
we're gonna it start it and I'm not sure
what you Oh My giddy stuff alright the
first I want to talk to you about is a
new item from the Beauty Blender which
I'm pretty pumped about
I think this wasn't that affordable
though I think it was kind of pricey I'm
not sure I'll have to don't look online
and see how much it cost but this is
their blogger Ozzie blotter Ozzie
Maserati
no honey princess blotter Ozzie it's
there it comes to lick this little
sample of their liquid their cleanser so
I haven't tried their cleanser before
believe it or not but anyways it comes
in this little pocket packaging placket
do you hear me plastic packaging and you
open it up and it comes with a mirror
and it comes with two of these little
thin Beauty Blender sponges and you're
supposed to be able to dab and blot away
the oil on your face I've come to the
conclusion then these are gonna be way
more effective than the little old
sheets i know i say the word old weird
you can leave your comment down below if
you want to express your feelings about
it i won't mind these i feel like you're
gonna be way more affected than this
blotting all sheets that are really thin
pieces of paper because this is like an
actual sponge however i would recommend
like washing this often cuz like how
much bacteria would sit in here can you
imagine like a lot huh but this is like
a really cool new gimmicky item that i'm
excited to see if it works
i'm gonna be testing it out i'm gonna
pop it in my purse i have to wait till I
would get greasy greasy which it won't
be long next trying out another new
product this is the cover FX mattifying
primer with acne treatment my face is
decided that it wants to erupt like a
volcano and get bumps all over it which
is really
knowing and inconvenient I mean when is
it ever convenient for you to get bumps
all over your face
I don't I thought I would try this out
but I solved this nonsense mattifying
anti-acne I mean you can't beat that
with a stick plus cover effects products
are normally pretty promising
I haven't really ran into anything from
cover bikes that I hate so I thought I
would try it out it comes in this little
white tube with a blue stripe on it
squeegee somehow it's still sealed it
feels so weird I want to say it's
silicone base but then whenever I blend
it out into my hand I don't think it's
silicone base so I have a it's silicone
based and it looks like the active
ingredient is self silicic acid which is
to help dry up any acne so I'm gonna be
using this until my face decides to act
right I think I got is from Becca
cosmetics this is her shimmering skin
perfecter Accord
opal and I actually went in the back
inspection because my opal highlighter
shattered and I know I can fix it
alcohol but like it broke so much that
it exploded everywhere and there's
barely any of it left so I actually went
to pick up a new powder one but then I
saw the cream highlights and a trick to
do if you would like that crazy
glowy glowy disco-ball glowy look like
it's gonna stand out in pictures and
you're gonna have like that glow tips to
do is to put a cream highlight on and
then powder your powder highlight on top
so you have double the highlight and
it's just gonna enhance it by a thousand
probably this is the opal this is like
their cream highlight and to be quite
honest with you it reminds me a little
bit of shell by Mac but it costs more
and I don't know I love Becca
highlighters I think they're amazing so
I thought I would try it opal in the
cream form instead of BRE buying the
powder form where I was with my sister
and she was like when I eat it the cream
on hey about another liquid lipstick
from Kat Von D this one is Lolita I love
her liquid lipsticks in a lot of you
guys asked me how do they compare to
honest Tashia
i think that honest arshia dose of
colors and the Kat Von D ones are very
very compatible as far as their texture
and formula
I think the liquid lipsticks first
they're drying and how the sound lips
can't really tell the difference
three of them if you want me to break
that down there are some other brands
that I can't tell the difference but
them three are pretty similar so just
depends on what color you want all
pretty similar in price to Selita and it
is like a fall color that's amazing and
I probably have something like this in
my drawer but it's not my Kat Von D so I
got it and I love her liquid lipstick so
excited to buy face wash by bozo this is
the makeup breakup cool
cleansing oh oh I've seen this talked
about here and there and never got to
try it it is a foaming what it looks
like to be a foaming face wash and what
I like to do I'm so backwards with my
facial skin routine but if it works for
me I might keep doing it but this full
face it makeup on I will just go in and
I'll start washing my face and scrubbing
all off typically I'll wash my face
twice to get the second layer of makeup
off once I'm done with that I'm so
backwards guys you gotta love me for
that I will take my makeup remover cloth
or makeup remover depending on how much
is left I'll wipe the excess off which
is typically around my eyes and then I
will tone moisturize yeah that doesn't
make a breakup so in theory I'm washing
the makeup off so I thought this would
be a good product to use I'm gonna try
it out never tried it out excited to try
it out let you know what I think about
that will get another new product I'm
really sorry about I'm sorry but every
time I inhale that candle goes up my
nose it is apple pumpkin pancakes and
it's changing my life oh this is a
product that's always sold out and I'm
just like why are you always sold out
why best who did at Sephora and I
snagged up and I was like mine the
TARDIS
thanks folks hardiest Tarr deist
high-performance clay paint lament liner
and I have heard this stuff a rade about
from the two people who are able to get
their hands on it better live up to all
that is raved about because if not I'm
gonna let you know how to fight for it
and I've had to fight for something it
better be good
I'm threatening you this with a little
brush too which is nice this would be a
really really good manageable black
black black gel liner and a tube which
is unique I'm excited about it
I'll let you know what happens the next
product I got another Beauty Blender and
I got it
read it says red-carpet limited edition
a special Beauty Blender right here I
will feel super special using it not
really I've just got tired of buying the
pink ones over and over and over again
and I wanted to change it up but I
didn't want the black ones it's like so
dark and dim like my soul so I decided
to get the red one I got the Tarte
lights camera lashes four in one at
mascara I don't know why it's a four in
one mascara what are the other three
products that are in this other than
mascara I've used this so many times in
the past that I think is amazing and I
saw it I was like oh yeah I love you
come to me so I got this and I highly
recommend this mascara it lengthens and
adds volume so good it just builds up so
good without getting your lashes chunky
I love love love this mascara it is an
awesome mascara I got something from
quiete this is the part partner in prime
eye primer so I've heard that this is a
really strong eye primer quiete is
typically a nail polish brand and
they're coming out with all kinds of
cool makeup lately they're really
hitting the market big and I've heard
that they're eyeprimer is thebomb.com so
again if you don't live up to your
expectations I'll let you know what
happens with this it seems like a pretty
typical eye primer I mean it's just like
the typical like nude color it rubs in
it feels similar to the toothpaste eye
primer in the urban decay ones it feels
super similar they all are kind of
similar to me that's why I always just
go and then if you think my Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre cuz it's like super
heavy duty as an eye primer but I want
to try out a different stuff because
that's what I'm here for I mean I'm
community Blanca I like to try out
different stuff and let you know next
this is typically this is the main
reason I went to Sephora to pick up the
NARS concealer this is a creamy radiant
concealer and I always get shade coast
custard I cannot find a better concealer
shade for me and that is one of the
reasons I always go back to this this is
my fourth tube of this and it is $28 a
tube it works so good it blends out so
easy and my favorite thing about it I'm
wearing it right now I've scraped a
little bit that was out of my other
tubes but my favorite thing about it is
the fact that it just it doesn't come
and the color is so good for my skin
tone custard medium one Kuster another
concealer by urban decay and I'm like
see I love this ever decay to consider a
lot too but the problem I'm having is
the shade that I haven't in is too light
so I think I have me neutral light or a
shoot what do I have
I'm gonna go check I have light neutral
and it's just I feel like whenever I
highlight my face with it at the end of
my makeup I just white like washed out I
was like because it's just like too much
happening so I went and got medium
neutral but when i swatched on my hand
my sister's like ninh in it that's way
too dark to use as your concealer so
these are like there's nothing in
between these though like this is the
next step down but it's like a drastic
step down and I'm just like confused
honestly so my thought is to mix the two
these are $28 to a piece it was the same
as the NARS one so honestly I don't even
know why I'm dealing with this I guess
because I never like to use the same
product too much like I always love
switching up my makeup products like on
the daily but I don't know what to do is
they be editorial getting all snazzy
using 18 different shades of concealer
trying to figure out my color you know
what's going on that is it for the
Sephora haul so it's like a tray of
happiness I can always hope you spend
your money trust me
I'm a horrible influence oh thank you
guys so much for coming by my channel I
really appreciate it
it's gonna be a bumble bee for Halloween
please give this video a thumbs up if
you did enjoy digging through my support
bag with me I got for you guys I love
you guys and I hope to see you each and
every one in my next video
that sums I want to cut my hair like
this short oh I think I want to oh my
god stop stop I'm done okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
