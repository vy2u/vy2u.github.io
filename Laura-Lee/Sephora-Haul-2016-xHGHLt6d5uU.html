Sephora bag we're gonna do a Sephora
haul for you guys I love you're super
excited to see it today and on top of
everything I'm having a great hair day
which is rare in this neck of the woods
so my hair is looking fabulous my
fingernails are not they keep me humble
I am so excited to be here a bit back
filming and you're like what are you
talking about you always upload videos
Laura and it's because I've been gone to
Cabo which I have amazing trip with a
lot of other amazing people in the
beauty industry and so actually I
pre-recorded so haven't filmed in like
over a week so it just feels good to be
back girls Oh girls and boys I went to
Sephora and they had the points double
the points on the skincare so I got to
get busy skincare stuff and some new
things in the makeup world so I'm going
to start sharing it with you I can't
wait to show you be sure to check out my
social media before you leave and we're
going to jump right in and get started
jumping right in the first thing that I
got is something that I've never tried
before in my whole entire life it is by
dr. jart dr. jart
and these look extremely weird but and
that's like what irks me about anything
that looks weird it could potentially be
dangerous for you I just want to tamper
in I'm just kidding the first one I got
it's their masks whether they like those
sheet masks that link you look a
serial-killer whenever you're wearing
them hi first one I got is a brightening
solution which is just an ultra fine
micro microfiber sheet mask I don't know
if they work I don't know how great they
are just leave on for 10 to 20 minutes
and they're supposed to change your life
step hopefully it will the next thing
that I got is the derp mask and it is
okay so it's supposed to be like a
lifting line mask and let's talk about
this you guys see it the smile lines hey
I got a mask and you're supposed to
literally just put it right here it's
like a odd shape mask up it should be
really good I'm really excited about it
um yeah next thing that I got is from
Peter Thomas Roth this is fake math
coholic and this is an exclusive thing
to Sephora it's like the mass campus
these are pretty darn big so it was 75
for five of them which includes their
$80 mass which is the 24 karat gold mass
which I'm most excited to buy actually
my friend Jackie which you guys had
probably heard me talk about before she
bought this and she was showing it on
her snapchat and I was like oh girl
totally copying Jackie anyways you also
get the cumber mask which I have the big
one of this and I love it and it's great
for hydrating your skin so if your skin
is dry and scaly like a snake you are
like me and this mask is amazing for you
and then it comes with their Irish more
mud purifying mask a roast stem cell
mass and a pumpkin enzyme mask I don't
know what's gonna happen to my face you
guys but we're gonna try this out the
next thing that I got em ooh I'll finish
skincare we'll finish talking about
skincare and then we'll move on one of
my favorite moisturizers of all times
this is the origins ginseng energy
boosting moisturizer and I absolutely
love this for morning and honestly night
time too so this is a gel moisturizer
that smells like orange juice that was
like a fill trying to fling it I can't
get the little I got it on my nose
that's not my highlight anyways I'm
obsessed with this I have burned through
two of these completely and what I love
most about it is this a gel moisturizer
therefore its water may not all based so
it's not going to clog your pores if
you're dealing with acne or you get
really easy clogged big big pores that
are just filled up or they get clogged
whatever your situation is switching
over to a gel moisturizer is ideal for
you because you're kicking out the hole
in your skin the next thing that I got
is the glam globe this is this came from
like the mini section where they always
get you allottee of this situation is
that you're totally getting ripped off
because of the sizes of the product and
how much they charge them for it you
would be saving money by buying the
actual like full-size version remember
whatever a girl still buys it this is
the thirsty cleansed AG de G who daily
hydrating
again my skin is dry and it always needs
some love so I'm going to be trying this
out again it's my glam glow and Glen
glow everything I bought for them except
for their lip plumper I have been
absolutely obsessed with so we're gonna
try her out and see what she does for me
the next thing that I got is a new
product from benefit and I am extremely
excited to be trying it out this is shy
beam it is a nude pink matte radiant
highlighter so how is a matte
highlighter I don't know so it's a low
profile baby pink soft shimmers in this
and the skin so you're supposed to
lightly stroke and blend a tiny amount
along your cheek and brow bones just
right through here where you would
normally put a highlighter it says
that's what you're supposed to apply it
and again it's supposed to be just a
super subtle highlight which I guess
it's weird that I bought this because
normally I like to be glowing like a
disco ball about this she's because the
packaging was pretty and it was new and
I needed it in my life I didn't even
show you guys so it actually looks like
this it's just like their other you know
highlighters and stuff it's like on the
little brush oh it's gorgeous
I mean it's subtle but it's still there
look at that me I wouldn't put that much
on my face but it's subtle but it's not
like one of those unnoticeable
highlights so I think this is actually
gonna be a great product and I'm really
glad that I bought it kinda want to set
it out because it's so freakin cute like
I wish if I put my hair up like pinned
it in the back they would actually stay
like this all day but what would happen
is it would look like this like it would
fall I hear plays games with me I think
that I got I'm really excited about
because I've been eyeballing this for a
while it's before like I would walk by
it fill it out like and I was with
teller he's actually I just I can get it
from Y Adele is this the Yves
saint-laurent blur Perfector so I
thought it was really cool it comes with
a pouch to put it in because it's super
font size I love the packaging it's like
a blush pink and then it has the wise L
on the front just die and then how
gorgeous so it's like this baby pink
cream and it is the smoothest filling so
soft not creamy but it's I want to say
it's silicone base but it's not I don't
know it's so hard to describe
but I love it and what it is is a facial
primer and it's there to smooth and blur
out the skin but I mean really how cute
is this they sold me on the packaging is
what happened I normally use a smoothing
primer right through here because I have
I was I have very large pores um but
they're there you know and I girl can
use a little help the next product I got
and very excited about is my Smashbox
and I'm have quite a few of their
lipsticks so there's a hair so I wanted
another one and this one is pumped Matt
oh so this is why they're um I think
this is new this is one of their matte
lipsticks because I'm all about matte
and honestly I know it's kind of a
strange color it's like a purple grey
but I thought it was so freakin gorgeous
oh I love it and there was like one lab
so you know whenever there's one left of
something that you love you're like oh
well then it's love for me to get like
it's mine
I felt arc to buy it and I bought it and
I loved it um I love the color of it I
think it's different I have more pinks
and reds and news than I know what I
could possibly do with so whenever I'm
buying my own lipstick I typically go
for something a little different the
next thing that I bought and I'm like
Laura why did you do this
but I bought the new brow definer by I'm
Sasha Beverly Hills people say what do
you say honest Tashia that's how you
pronounce her neck it's not Anastasia is
honest Tashia this is called the brow
definer and I got medium brown because
that's what I'm wearing I'm wearing
actually the dip brow and medium brown
but I went a little heavy today so we're
looking like we're dark brown oh it
needs to get out of here this is the
brow definer and it is a unique tool I'm
Smashbox came out with something pretty
much identical to it okay I didn't think
mine was going to work so it's like a
little triangle on the brush and you can
use it in three different ways so you
can go flat with it you can go sideways
with it or you can flip it to the point
and have like a really sharp line so you
can use it in three different ways it's
a multi-use pencil they have it in all
the shades that they have the dip brow
and all and the brow is in and as bigger
so it's going to last much longer than
your brow is I know like the number one
complaint with the brow is is that they
don't last long enough and I know I
would burn through em like water I
probably use my brow is more than I
drink water I need to get my life
together then next I got the upside-down
palette this is the shade light palette
by Kat Von D I am the last person on
planet earth to buy this palette I'm not
a hundred percent sure why I bought this
ballot because I have enough contour
palette but you can never have enough so
I don't even know what that means
no it just looked appetizing to me
appetizing like a food like a good plate
of food that's how it look to me their
cardboard packaging is so thick look at
that no I just really this is a great
travel palette too and probably break on
me but they look so soft and creamy and
pretty and I've heard nothing but great
things about this palette so I just
really wanted it you'll probably see me
use it in an upcoming tutorial I don't
feel like there's much I should say
about it because you guys already know
you know you know about this guy good
hair day going self the next thing that
I purchase is a foundation by Bobby
Brown I've never owned one of their
foundations but I pretty much like most
things that I try from Bobby Brown so I
thought I would give their foundations I
tried just to let you guys know honestly
I have quite a few foundations that I'm
madly in love with and I don't really
feel an urge to buy more but part of
being a beauty blogger I feel like is
trying out different products that you
don't hear a lot about and letting your
viewers know what your thoughts are on
them so I did picked up the moisture
rich foundation by Bobbi Brown they have
one that's like all matte but because my
skin's dry I figured the moisture rich
one would compliment me more the shade
that I was tested for and match for what
shade natural number four and oh it was
kind of white I always think like I'm a
Bahama Mama tan and the reality is I'm
not and this is probably my shade but
this is natural for and it has SPF 15
which I love my sunscreen girlfriends
you should love your sunscreen too I
don't know if it's good or not but I'm
gonna try it out and I'll let you guys
know my thoughts and that sums it up for
the Sephora haul I got blew through
everything really fast because I talk
too fast if you stay here till the end
of the video today I have truffle by
those two colors on my lips so now you
know you guys so much for being here and
watching I love you guys and I hope to
see you all in my next video and don't
forget to give
video thumbs up if you did enjoy this is
it can find a new home I would be great
like one can this it'd be like over here
like right there
not like front and center oh oh I
thought I had a candle lit we all know I
would have been on fire we're done here
we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
