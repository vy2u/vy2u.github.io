video is going to be a very exciting
video I think I do this videos twice a
year where they do the 20% off with a V
I mean the Vav Rouge are you going
Sephora
you spend your life savings just a good
old time so I am very excited I got a
lot of awesome products that I am super
excited to share with you guys a couple
of things I dig it online and threw them
in the bag that we could just do one big
old fat huh once you announce that my
shirt does say pizza is BAE it's true
I've no announcements we're gonna jump
right in and get started I hope you
enjoyed this haul video if you're
wondering like what should I get from
Sephora I hope this answers some of your
questions so let's jump in and get
started
did finally get the Giorgio Armani
luminous self foundation I have heard
that this stuff is the game-changer head
it better be because it was $65 with 20%
of it but it was still $65
woah that is not an affordable
foundation like not even trying to be an
affordable foundation so there's a
better change of my life now I did pick
my shade online and how I recommend
doing that is by googling the foundation
and a human well I actually put swatches
on their hands do the pictures online
which can make it really difficult to
compare on your face I kind of feel like
this one might be a little bit too pink
for me but luckily Sephora is so
generous with their returns and then
will let you exchange it in store which
I might have to do but I don't know I
got 5.5 do you guys think I was crazy
for getting that shade oh no that looks
like it might fit perfect fit
it might look perfect it might match
perfect I think I nailed it Oh guys I
think I got the exact shade I don't know
I want those hot put on my face but girl
you see me use this in some tutorials
forgive me if I do love it because I
don't like to use like high high-end
makeup
I think high-end makeup it's like
toothpaste every K high high-end makeup
is what I call like YSL Dior Givenchy
Giorgio Marni well I hope it works out
for me next perk I got is a backup
better than sex mascara I keep buying
the stuff I just love it I've always
loved it it love I love how the Vivah
booms some lashes makes them fluff I
just knows and sex
where it's happened then I guys a
self-made pallet hanger like Laura we
know you already have this pallet
girlfriend you get crazy I bought it for
maybe something on my channel starts
with a G and ends with it away I don't
know
next time that I got is my second
audacious lipstick from NARS these are
35 a piece so again there are little
bits pricey
who like outside making all that racket
it sounds like someone's on my roof it's
a squirrel
are there squirrels in California work
well is the name of this one and I just
love these already have Anna which I
have them I have not been to 425
whatsoever so Rockwell is a really
pretty nude color now it does look pinky
nude ooh I didn't think it was gonna be
that pinky nude but it is really pretty
I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna wear it all
day long I don't know why snip things
like this because they don't smell like
anything I don't know why do that it's
so weird I like I want to snip
everything I don't do that to people
though they're one of my favorite
favorite lipsticks they're super pricey
but I think the quality of the lipstick
is worth the price because they are
awesome next thing I picked up this was
an online one
oh my lo this may be really too big for
me these are who to be lashes and this
is Lana number 10 whoa Nelly
like I'm gonna try these but they look
the ba-boom dramatic like even from me
and I'm like a super dramatic lash
person these look extreme extremes so I
hope they're not too crazy if they're
not you'll see him in a tutorial because
that's what I bought them for I want it
to do like I saw him and I was like ooh
this would be pretty would like this to
always have things in my head it's all
up here everything's up here it'd look
really big like they would shoot off and
like slap people in the faces that blink
we'll see what happens with those next I
did pick this up in store this is the
Bobbi Brown bronze glow highlighter it
is so pretty the box that it came in
looks like all silver and pretty I
believe I threw it away
but it's just like a golden highlighter
it looks super golden but actually
whenever you put it on your cheek bone
it is super bronzy so it's not
necessarily a just golden highlight I
think that this will be a
pretty highlight to kind of dust on the
forehead just a little bit everywhere to
glow fi your skin to to fleek fi your
skin to glow fly to luminize I don't
know it like I said in the packaging I
think it's cuz it's so compressed it
looks super like a golden golde golde
highlight but it's really not it's
called bronze glow and at first I was
saying wanted they call it a Barone's
it's super bronzy whenever you get it a
little bit on your brush and does some
on the cheek you're like this is not
golden no it's bronze the next item I
got is from Urban Decay cosmetics this
is the eyeshadow primer potion I believe
this is their new one now I remember
using this stuff like many many many
moons ago like when it first came out
and like we just discovered I primer the
new packaging is what sold me on it this
little crystal lid just made my heart
flutter because I thought it was so
freakin chic and pretty and you can also
stab someone with it they attacked you
ah I'm not the only one that turns
everything into a weapon this is just
the original color in it so it's just a
neutral beige color but I love that it
comes on a dude foot applicator so it
makes it super easy for application
rather than like a squeegee tube I don't
know squeegee chips I feel like I get
too much out and a lot of the product
goes to waste
now I do typically wear my mac
prolongwear or my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre as my eyeshadow primer but I want
to go back to trying this because I know
it's really good so I'm gonna try to
start using this again just to say my
thoughts upon it then I did pick up like
my fifth Naked Skin Urban Decay
concealer because this concealer is
everything it is so obvious how loud
trouble actually finding my right shade
in it either go too light or too dark
I think neutral medium is my shade
however whenever I go look my drawer is
probably not I'm probably gonna have
like three neutral mediums in there and
be like dang it that's the one that was
too dark oh it always happens to me but
I'm hoping you know what this looks like
it's the right shade I think I got the
right shape this concealer is awesome it
is major coverage to my face ptosis is
how much even smells
let's give it a sniff oh it smells just
like the pro longwear concealer from mac
it reminds me so much of the formula
know that the ingredients
this has to pretty much be the exact
same seriously oh my goodness I love
this concealer and a little bit goes a
super long way so you will have it with
this for a long long time
this is $28 but I definitely think it's
worth twenty eight dollars it cost you
just as much as the NARS creamy radiant
concealer but it is a completely
different texture of it it's it's pretty
much creaseless if you set it correctly
and it lasts for a really long time and
the coverage is phenomenal next time I
picked up is the Murad essential C
moisturizer on broad-spectrum a 30 now
it takes such a little amount of this to
use on your face that the two back my
last two is actually went back because I
use it all because whenever things have
that sunscreen home they can expire
quickly so be sure to check on that and
your foundations in your moisturizer
sunscreen doesn't last for that long so
anyways I just picked up another one I
love this moisturizer a because of the
amount of sunscreen in your it is so
good about putting sunscreen in our
formula to protect your skin that is
what Mira is all about and it's also an
extremely lightweight moisturizer to
have as much sunscreen in it as it does
it normally I find that whenever
moisturizers have a lot of sunscreen and
I'm they get super heavy and Olay anger
easy Oh actually my skin absorbs it so
well and it doesn't have like that
greasy sheen left on my face that's why
I keep going back to this one and now I
don't use this as my nighttime
moisturizer I only uses as my daytime
moisturizer after I wash my face in the
morning the last product I picked up I
did get a sample of this and I used no I
actually didn't yes I did I got a sample
of this like in the little points perk
bonus whatever it's called the insider I
don't know there's like so many of those
now anyways this is the living proof
style AB prime it's a light sender spray
said okay forget this super weird lid
like I don't know what this little hunk
on the lid is but it's very disturbing
to me anyways this spray is like a
texturizing spray but it doesn't leave
your hair feeling it does not leave your
hair feeling super crunchy or hard I
hate that whenever sprays do that
because it like takes the soft flowing
this out of your hair I like this one a
lot because it did add some texture to
my hair but still left it feeling soft
so just how you get the big boy here
is for fine hair and I have it my hair
is weird like I have thick hair but it's
very fine here so the tangles easy and
it gets poofy and it gets weird and it
does crazy stuff and it takes over my
life this stuff is awesome for fine hair
that is it that is all that I got from
Sephora all that I got I hope you guys
enjoyed it I love you guys thank you so
much for being here I love you little
pieces and help subscribe before you
leave and I hope to see you all in my
next video
