video is obviously gonna be my step to
immerse papers as you read in the title
of this video honestly I don't have like
a crazy amount of stuff to talk about in
my favorites video because I've been
using basically the same stuff that I
mentioned last month which was my August
favorites but I'm really excited that
you're here thanks for being here who I
guess what I did start my blog so I have
a blog and it's called larlie blogs
Tyler built the whole website his self
and I made my first blog post yesterday
I would love you guys to subscribe to my
blog I will link it down below if you
want to check that out or you can just
type Lauren Lee blogs calm and you know
I'll pop up and stuff anyways so that
happens we're going to jump right in our
hall favorites and we're gonna get study
first off we always start my favorite
song of the month and I'm gonna have to
give it to J Bieber with his what do you
mean the most relaxing calm song ever
I'm honestly the first time I heard it I
wasn't my favorite song because I was
like where it's a B because there's not
like no beat but it's super soft and ooh
song so I'm diggin it I mean it grew on
me I like it actually liked it a lot um
yeah mm-hmm favorite TV show whoo season
5 a walking dead came on Netflix which I
typically don't catch TV shows when they
air live I just wait for him to come on
Netflix cuz thanks just get too crazy
for me to keep up with all that business
but I have kind of gotten out of The
Walking Dead because it took them so
long to release season 5 so annoying
come on Netflix came out on Netflix and
I watched the whole entire season in one
day and no I'm not embarrassed about
that should I be probably so but I'm not
because it happened and I'm so far back
into Walking Dead that I don't know what
it did you I'm like oh get me more it's
like crack cocaine I swear someone would
be a real da and let me know when season
six airs on TV I'm gonna try to keep up
with it because I've just become so
obsessed that I don't know what to do
and I need season six like now we're
gonna talk about some product skincare I
don't talk about saying care too much on
my channel which you guys always asked
me to talk about a little more and I am
newly trying out a new skincare system
which I like a lot there's the thing I
went back home to Alabama this month and
I think just like the altitude and
humidity and all the climate change and
all that it made my face freaked out and
I can honestly say my face hasn't broken
out in forever and a day and there were
a boatload exist I was snapping about it
I was being super annoying about it I
was being like a five-year-old about it
who had all these little bumps all over
my face that I covered well with makeup
that's what brought me to expose
skincare so it's a salicylic acne
treatment so I was like acid is the
active ingredient and my skin is very
dry so I can't use anything too harsh on
my skin to take care of the acne that's
there so this one is very natural that
has green bean extract sent to heal your
skin which was a big turn-on for me
because a lot of times whenever I have a
zit I'm one of those picker people are
you a picker people I have to pick it
until there's a hole in my face and I'm
I get 10 times worse than everyone was
this has the green tea healing ex-truck
in it so it helps to heal that on your
face
I love it I love that it's gentle is
amazing for people with severe acne but
they have sensitive skin so usually in
between all the harsh chemicals out
there to take care of your acne is just
too hard on your sensitive skin but you
still want to get rid of your acne that
is what I recommend this can care for
there's a cleanser a toner 2 serum so
there's a poor serum and an acne
treatment serum and lastly there is the
microderm scrub also got this little
micro squishy squishy soft soft claw you
know when I worked for the dermatologist
a lot of our patients were not
consistent with their acne treatment
because it was very harsh on their skin
and their skin just couldn't tolerate
this like the severe dryness that comes
from it so I think this Acme line would
be great for that and whenever you spend
40 bucks you can get a free microderm
scrub I want to mention to you a palette
that I think is so under underrated on
the YouTube world I hear so much about
more people brushes on YouTube but me
personally I guess I just haven't ran
across many videos talking about this
blush palette this is the 9b blush
palette and holy Toledo it is gorgeous
it is so beautiful their blushes are
SuperDuper pigmented it and it has an
awesome array of colors in this palette
I mean this could be great for any skin
tone because of how many colors comes in
it I mean you get nine colors but you
also get like super neutral colors that
you can wear every day or you could even
get these little spicier colors that you
can wear I love this palette I have been
wearing the crap out of it I just did a
tutorial involving it it is seriously
amazing
move your brushes stuff like this is
like super affordable so it's awesome
next product I want to talk about is the
cover of egg so this is their total
cover creme Foundation and definitely
not a big fan of these type of products
but while using this as a mirror to do
my foundation
I noticed like some areas my foundations
need that I just need a little extra
coverage because my little breakouts and
so what I was doing is just dabbing my
brush into this and just touching up
after I put my foundation on and I loved
it so now I have continuously been
reaching for this product just to kind
of touch on areas that need a little bit
of extra coverage after I applied
thin layer of my foundation it just sits
beautifully on top of your foundation
and I'm really been obsessed with it
cover FX makes awesome products and by
the way this is shade in 40 which is a
little bit too dark for me but actually
it works out whenever I'm just trying to
like touch up this particular area so
yes please and thank you let's talk
about lip products we always talk about
that the end let's talk about that at
the beginning okay first my favorite lip
product just for fall has just been
wonderful this is Tootsie bar color pop
this is one of their matte ones and it
is so pretty but I did use this in my
grunge glam makeup tutorial so if you
haven't seen it why not I just love it
it's just different it's like this gray
really taupey color it's almost like
brown 'te is weird it's a weird color
but it's a changeup and I think that's
why I love it so much and it's $5 so you
can't beat that with a stick also next
pink nude this little gem has I feel
like I mentioned this last month I may
have a repeater anyway this is pink nude
by negs it's their lip liners their lip
liners are so awesome I have a little
bit of trouble with their eye liners but
their lip liners are like oh this is
just a beautiful neutral lip liner that
everyone needs in their collection if
you see now that also or CVS or ever
you're buying your next you need it I
promise it goes great with almost any
lipstick because I just like to add a
liner with any lipstick even if it
doesn't match the lipstick just somewhat
close just about lip product don't
feather because that's so annoying and
gross another lip liner absolutely
cannot put down what is it with me talk
about all these lip liners oh this spice
by Mac and this is another thing like
why is this not talked about more hello
people this is a beautiful color it's
like a super brown color but then it's
almost got like a pink undertone it's a
little bit weird it's kind of hard to
describe but basically it's beautiful
from fall time and I've been filling in
my lips with it a lot because Mac lip
liners they will last you forever in a
day if you fill in your whole lip with
them and just like wear them as a
lipstick I like I like that I you guys
have seen me use day in day out just
obsess over is Riviera by honest option
Beverly Hills and honestly nourish I saw
she was coming out with all of her
highlights
I like pinpointed this one I was like
that's gonna be my new baby but anyways
I just can't get
of it I like pack this crap on it is
unreal how much I put on it I wear too
much of it but I just can't stop like
it's so pretty so I won't stop me no
don't talk about it oldie but a goodie
this is a Milani runway lashes mascara
if you tried it you probably love it
um I use this in this tutorial recently
I dug it out of my mascara door like
Hello where have you been hiding from me
and why I love this mascara it is the
bomb seriously it builds up your lashes
so well as well as the length isn't like
you can't ask for anything else my cats
are acting like heathen another thing I
love about it a lot is that it doesn't
flake there's nothing I hate more than a
flaky mascara it's like a flaky guy get
out of here talk about this skin de Navy
I already talked about this in a video a
little bit of so I'll just touch on it
for a minute the skin anadi its
skin didn't ap yeah finishing spray it
works I mean that's all I can say about
it little demo for you whenever I talked
about my video I had so many people
commenting saying oh my god yes I
already know about I already love it
Laura where you been it's amazing I love
Scandinavia it's awesome and I want to
talk about more on my channel so skin
may be setting spray
it's a thumbs up for me like two thumbs
up if I had a third thumb up it would
get a third thumbs up thanks what I want
to talk about is the on Sacha Beverly
Hills number twelve eyebrow pencil i
feel like this product isn't talked
about enough this is a almost like a
must-have product when it comes to using
the dip brow pomade and i know so many
people use the dip brow pomade and
though i can't get it right this product
isn't work for me it's too weird of a
formula and sometimes it's because of
the tool that you're using with it if
you buy the number twelve brush to use
with the different pomade i promise it
will work out for you so much better and
it changed my life whenever i finally
broke down and bought it the brush isn't
even that that that expensive it's like
a medium high-end price anyway so my mom
was using the dip brow pomade and when i
saw where i went back to Alberta masa I
was like dang it mom come on now come on
we can do better than that we went to
Sephora and of course the first thing
about her was this brush and then we
went over how to use the product in the
brows and her eyebrows work fleek ins
some other stuff oh I mean is this not
everything and more
my birthday was September the first and
so big before II had this delivered to
me and it's called the birthday box and
I hope they sell this in stores I'm sure
they do it I thought this was just like
the happiest cutest present ever if you
know someone's birthday is coming up and
you don't know what to get them I'm sure
they will love this just as much as I
did I'm dealing with allergies what
comes in it is you get the little body
wash and the lotion and it's my favorite
snin it's the clean on me well I don't
even know what's them but these are the
same sin they're just marvelous I don't
know when it comes with a loofah it is
just the cutest little thing in the
world and I love soap and Glory's whole
little pink line that's like
old-fashioned and adorable and has all
these little sassy sayings I was just
tickled pink honestly whenever I got it
and I've been using the crap out of a
lotion
