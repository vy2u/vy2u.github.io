tutorial with no chitchat and Bob first
we're actually gonna start with the eyes
instead of the face makeup and I'll show
you why in a minute we're gonna be using
the artist Couture palette by Anastasia
Beverly Hills and I'm gonna start with
the shade soft peach which is this basic
nude white color and I'm going to blend
that in the crease and all-over
basically with a e25 brush from sigma
this is gonna help soften up the look
and it's also gonna help the other
colors blend so easily next we're gonna
go in with Morocco which is the super
warm tone reddish brown color it's
mostly a red color but it transfers more
as a little bit of a brown undertone and
I'm going to take that same e 25 brush
and I'm gonna blend that right in the
crease I'm using a super light hand that
way there are no harsh lines with this
and it's blended out really soft and
seamlessly and I'm just doing small
circular motions and definitely taking
my time because I want the transition
shade to be like one of the softest
shades and I'm just gonna go back in
with a little bit more of that Morocco
color and just keep blending it out the
more you blend it out of course the soft
where it's gonna be and I'm actually
gonna take my eye shadow out a little
bit further than usual next I'll go in
with fudge which is basically a matte
brown color like there's not much to it
these colors are super super pigmented
but I'm gonna be going in with that a 25
brush again and I'm basically gonna
apply this right on top of Morocco the
first color that we applied or really
the second color we applied and I'm just
gonna really take my time blending it
out I did use a little bit less color
because I don't want adds much dark
brown all over the crease area but I am
just going back and forth from inner to
outer corner making sure it is soft and
seamless now I'm gonna do a weird little
thing I'm going to take this random
white eyeliner pencil you can use any
cream white or light color products that
you have and I'll place it in the inner
corner this is gonna help us set a light
base for the color we're going to put
down on the inner corner and help it to
show up better then I'm just gonna blend
that out with my finger a little bit
then I'm going in with the greatest
color of all times this is pink
champagne oh my gosh it has this
beautiful foiled finish the camera does
not do it justice
I don't know why I wasn't picking it up
as pretty as it is but I just dampened
it with a little bit of mac fix+ spray
and I'm going in with this tiny dome
shaped brush I'm just applying it to the
inner corner but I am packing the color
on because I want it to show up
cinema-going with heirloom which is a
dark purple shade and then place this
right in the center of the eye with that
same dumb shape brush I'll have the
brush put down below it's a more P price
not sure of the number of it off the top
of my head but it's just a tiny little
pencil brush basically and I'm going to
make sure I'm just blending this back
and forth I really had to build up this
color because it wasn't showing up that
well so I just kept adding and blending
and adding and blending and then I was
also softening up that line there where
the pink champagne and the purple colour
meet then I went back in with fudge and
a little gum shaped brush that's a
little bit more tapered and I start
blending this on the outer V area the
places that don't have the eyeshadow
then I go in with a t25 brush from Sigma
that we used originally and I blend that
out next I'm going to take noir which is
a plain matte black color and this is
where we're gonna deepen this outer
corner up and really open up the outer
corner of the eyes I love the black
color I did have to build it up a little
bit because it was blending out until
almost nothing as you can see here so I
was going back I was adding some I was
blending it out then I was adding some
and blending it out that's the way to
get your softest look especially when
using dark colors because they can be
very dangerous and by the way it's okay
if you go out really far because we're
going to clean that up in just a minute
for our next step when in doubt wing it
out we're gonna go in with a little bit
of Inglot black gel liner in this yo six
liner brush from Sigma this Sigma brush
is the trick to doing perfect winged
liner I use this in every tutorial when
I use a gel of course I'm gonna wing it
out on this tutorial you don't have to
if you don't want to definitely make
this look your own if you just want to
do liner just apply a thin line across
the upper lash line to define the eyes
if you want to wing it out well then
honey child you just wing it out as far
as that I can't see okay I'm just being
silly now but I'm gonna wing it out I've
done winged eyeliner on a bazillion
tutorials if you want to in depth
version I have a video on it next I'm
gonna take a clean little YP and I'm
going to clean up the outer edge added a
layer of mascara and I'm gonna add
iconic by house of lashes these lashes
are poppin right now they're super
popular and I love them so much they're
so pretty next I've already got my
foundation and primer on I've done that
in a lot of tutorials you can check out
my foundation routine if you want to
know more about that I'm gonna be adding
my Mac Pro Longwear concealer and NC 30
to the usual areas to highlight my face
then I'm gonna go in with a 57 brush
from Sephora this is their concealer
brush I love this brush to blend out my
concealer and I'm just gonna blend it
out using a dabbing motion that way we
don't move the concealer around too much
next I'm going to go in with this
translucent powder from Neutrogena which
has become one of my favorite setting
powders from the drugstore I'm gonna
pack this onto the concealer it's gonna
help it last longer gonna make it look
smoother and gonna help my eyeliner and
bottom lash line not to fade into my
concealer now I'm gonna go into the
cocoa contour palette from Too Faced
I've really been loving this palette
this is like the third time I've used it
and it's pretty bomb calm so I'm gonna
keep using it but I'm just gonna contour
the normal areas below the cheekbones
carve them out a little bit give us the
sunkissed forehead area next I'll add a
little bit of blush I'm using this
peachy shade from Too Faced that I
didn't get a shot of it I'm so sorry
I'll have it listed
right in the description box can we take
a look at my Becca highlighter and opal
yeah can you cry for me right now
it broke oh I'm just gonna apply a
little bit to the tip of the nose upper
cheekbone area and I also applied a
little bit to my Cupid's bow but you
didn't see all that now I'm gonna go in
with fudge in an angled brush and I'm
gonna brush that right along the lower
lash line being sure to get it as tight
and as close up to those lower lashes as
I possibly can then you don't want to
leave it like that you want to soften it
up a little bit going in with a dome
shape brush from morphe I'm gonna grab
that Morocco color which is a red tone
color and I'm gonna soften up that lower
lash line lastly I'm going to add a bit
of that pink champagne color to the
inner corner to really open up the eyes
and make us look awake and sparkly then
I'm gonna grab this Marc Jacobs liner
pencil which is the only liner that
stays in your waterline all day long is
$25 and that totally stinks but it works
and this is their high liner and black
and I loved it so much I didn't get a
shot of me doing my lips but I used the
new liquid lipstick by Mandy makeup
artist and Gerard and serenity it is so
beautiful I'll have it linked down below
with a discount code I love you guys
thank you so much for watching and I've
hooked it to you all in my next video
