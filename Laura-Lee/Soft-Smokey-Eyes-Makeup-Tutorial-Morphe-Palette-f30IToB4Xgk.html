we're gonna jump right in and get
started
hello muffins so starting out we're
going with the tarte smoothing timeless
primer and what this does is stills in
larger pore areas or if you have any
acne scars or any unwanted areas that
need smoothening out you will place this
product in those areas next to actually
prime my skin and just to give it a
little bit of moisture I'm going with
the Smashbox primer spray I back up so
far because I don't want to get it on my
land then I'm going to mix together
these two shades of Make Up For Ever
foundation and liquid this is the Ultra
HD and I lurve this foundation I will
then blend it out with an F 80 brush
from Sigma as I always do
next I'm going in with a morphe 35c
palette such gorgeous palette and I will
mix together these two shades to begin
kind of as a transition shade I'm using
at you 25 brush from Sigma and I'm
laughing because I use this brush in
every tutorial all tutorial along you
guys are probably tired of hearing about
this naked brush but it's going to be
our transition shade and we're just
going to take my time and blend this all
in the crease I did use my Mac Paint Pot
in soft ochre as a base then I'll go in
with this little bit of a deeper bobby
purple shade and blend that right on top
of the transition shade into the crease
and again I'm using the same good
old-fashioned a25 brush from Sigma this
shape this brush is dome shaped so it
just gets right into that crease and it
does awesome job for blending then
whenever I use darker shades I like to
go in with the e-40 brush from Sigma and
I like to blend it out to make sure
everything is seamless then I will go in
with these two shades mix them together
I do have a fully-loaded brush here so
the shades did come out a little bit
dark but once I get it all blended it
out it look the you demas so beautifu
isn't a word I know and then I'll do the
same thing I'll go back in with that 840
and blend it out now this is the lid
color it's like a pink champagne shimmer
color it's such a gorgeous color and
then going with this large flat shader
brush is in E 60 and I did dampen it
with the mac fix+
as you saw I'm going to pack this all
over the lid and I would like to take a
moment to discuss them my fingernails
are gross
but I'm trying to let them breathe for
just like five minutes with nothing on
them so bear with me while I dance in
this video next I'm going to take this
little tiny dome shape brush this is de
45 and I'm just going to soften up that
crease where I applied the lid color
then I'll go in with my wicket gel liner
by Sigma and I'm going to wing it out
remember ladies and gentlemen when in
doubt whine get out so I do do some nice
thick black liner if you don't like the
wing you can just simply add a little
bit of liner to your upper lash line and
leave the wing off because I know not
everybody likes the wing eye
are you hi Harriet now I'll go in with
my NARS concealer this one is in custard
I'm going to apply this right underneath
the other under-eye as I do every
tutorial and just highlight the face you
guys pretty much know the routine and
I'm going to blend that out with my
booty blender and I am going to softly
Pat my face instead of really rub that
way it pushes it into the skin instead
of moves it around then I'll go in with
my tried-and-true Laura Mercier
translucent powder I'm going to pack
this on the under-eye just to make sure
it doesn't crease up a my concealer
doesn't run and at last and it stays in
place multiple reasons to add this to
your under eye area next I will go in
with honest Tashia contour kit I will
use the shade Java and this Tarte brush
it feels like butter on your skin huh
and so I'm just going to bronze up my
face I'm going to add it to my lower
cheekbone area around the forehead and I
did off-camera add a little bit to my
neck area just so everything blended out
now I'm going to take a dome-shaped
brush and just dust away any excess
translucent powder that is left
now I will go in with this gorgeous
holiday set from benefit this is like
the blush set and I'm going to go in
with coralista which is a peachy
iridescent color and I pop that onto the
apples of the cheeks and I'm going to
blend it back my lighting was a little
bit too bright I didn't realize it you
can't really see the blush but just know
it was gorgeous in person then I'll go
in with Becca's pearl um I didn't really
realize how pigmented this is right here
a whole good girl so what I did is put
that excess on my nose and forehead and
then blend it that off and it ended up
looking a fabulous highlight don't leave
and then I'm going to go in with that
first shade that we use the purple and
the brown and I'll blend that on the
lower lash line just making sure it's
nice and soft and gradient and then I'll
go in with a flat definer brush and grab
that darker purple color that we used in
the crease and I'm going to apply that
really close to those lower lashes and
just smoke it out a little bit
next I'll go in with my favorite mascara
this is the new one by Marc Jacobs I'm
going to apply this to the upper and
lower lashes if you don't want to add
false lashes which I'm going to be doing
you don't have to all you have to do is
just add a few coats of your favorite
mascara and a Viva boo boo bah you may
be done and but as for me you know your
girl loves the drama so I'm going to be
adding some lashes these are by violet
Voss I will have the name of them in the
description as well as every product I
use in this tutorial down in that
description box if you're confused or
have any questions on this check the
description now we're going to do the
lips this is like my favorite liquid
lipstick at the moment I love this very
color
I think it's Aria AR ia and I'm going to
apply this to the lips this liquid
lipstick will last all day without
Christine Christine creasing or crusting
up so it's fabulous and that's it for
this tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it

video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
