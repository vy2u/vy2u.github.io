I pick to the dollar baby my pathology I
hate to the dollar baby my god oh god my
god
what's up everyone this is sporty spice
and if you guys want to find out how to
turn yourself in the spot is spy for all
she had to do is keep watching and I
have my lovely friends with me but said
baby spice ginger spice Scary Spice and
posh spice and they're all doing
tutorials for Halloween and their
channel be sure to subscribe to all of
us and watch our videos we'd love you go
alright so this is the look I came up
with for sporty spice she didn't really
have a specific makeup look I googled
multiple pictures of her and I mean it
was just like nothing crazy going on
with her makeup and I'm like oh my god I
want to do fun makeup for Halloween so I
came up with this look I never do a lot
of graphic liner on my channel but I
really wanted to incorporate that
because I think sporty spice is a little
bit spunky she's got a little sass to
her she has really cool tattoos on her
arm so I just want it by the way I have
really kept cool tattoos on my arm my
friend Gabriel drew these on me he hand
drew these on me so I wanted that
eyeliner to kind of match the tattoos on
her arm and that's kind of what inspired
this look hope you guys enjoyed it I
know that the eyeshadow is neutral but I
feel like I didn't wanted to do crazy I
shadow and then crazy eyeliner so you
know what I mean it's one or the other
not both
so nose we're gonna jump right in the
video boy sure to subscribe before you
leave alright my friends were in Jobrani
and I'm taking the Baba pours primer
from it cosmetics I'm gonna apply this
all over
skin.this is going to help eliminate the
appearance of pores because sporty
sprouts ain't getting pores she might I
don't know I just made that up anyways
I'm going to take the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation I'm in shade sand
and I'm going to be using my f88 kabuki
this might not be the f88 it's a kabuki
brush from Sigma anywho and we're going
to apply this foundation all over my
face next I'll be taking my favorite
concealer which is the Tarte shape tape
concealer in shade light/medium and I'm
going to highlight the usual areas this
is kind of just like a makeup tutorial
but if you get a girl gang it can be a
total badass Spice Girls look you know
I'm sorry whose forty spice would you
place the coolest wanna just blend that
out with the same kabuki brush nothing
fancy going on here next you want to be
sure and set everything I'm going to be
using this setting powder I say it wrong
in every video in people
Besame I don't know anyways a setting
powder and I'm just going to apply that
where I applied the concealer that way
nothing gets crazy and tries to run away
next I want to take this eyeshadow from
make it peak I'll have everything listed
in the description box and I say that
because I don't know the name of the
shadow off the top of my head it's a
caramel shade it's one of their newer
shadows and I'm just going to apply that
into the crease then I'm going to take
the warmer tone shade and apply it right
on top of that caramel shade and just
buff it out I'm using an e25 brush from
Sigma Beauty and I'm making sure there's
no harsh edges because poor despise does
not like harsh added a little harsh
edges then I'm going to take a little
bit of a deeper color it's very similar
to cocoa bear I'm not sure if that's it
because I think all these are brand new
shades from makeup geek I'm just going
to play that right on top then to really
cut the crease area and define it I'm
going to take this light shade and just
pop it right on top with a synthetic
brush and it really kind of gives us a
guideline where to apply that graphic
liner and then going to dista weigh all
that excess powder that's left over from
baking our face I like to leave it there
want to do my eye shadow so you can just
dust away the fallout I'm going to end
up going back in and deepen it up the
crease a little bit because I just
didn't think it was defined enough and
then I take the essence gel liner which
is a super super bowl super affordable
gel liner and I start to wing it out and
I do a regular winged liner to start off
with
then once I get done filling that in I
take right where the crease starts and I
flicker it up and I totally screw it up
and it kind of smudged down I like to
leave my bloops in with makeup to let
you guys know that I am NOT a
perfectionist and mistakes happen and
that way we can relate to one another I
could have totally cut it out and
pretend like that didn't happen but a it
happened we're leaving it in the video
and you're going to know about it and
now I'm going to take this Revlon
mascara and just apply it to my lashes I
did end up adding a lot of fluffy a lot
one pair of fluffy false lashes as you
guys know I love the drama but if you
don't like the false lashes you can
simply leap them off next I'm going to
take my pure I'm so funny no not okay
I'm gonna take my pure cameo contour
stick I'm just going to contour out my
face I've really been enjoying this
little stick lately and it's just a
really easy way to cream contour and I
just take a little I think this brush
from morphe and blend it all out any
time I use any cream product I
personally like to then go in and set it
with a bit of a powder product right on
top so I'm just taking NARS Laguna
bronzer I'm just setting all of that and
it also deepens up the contour a little
bit because you've been wearing this out
at night um you know you can go a little
bit more heavy with the makeup then I'm
just going to take that warmth home
brown shade girl put down the Starbucks
and blend it on the lower lash line I'm
going to take this sweetheart blush from
Too Faced and just apply it to the
apples of my cheeks
we're just doing the usual thing now
take a little bit champagne pop I'm
popping it onto my cheekbones like
Jacqueline Hill and then I apply it to
my nose and run it all up you guys know
the drill you know what I'm doing here
you can guess what I'm gonna do next I'm
gonna add a lip product I'm taking
noisette buys you a I didn't really ever
notice forty spice wearing like a bright
red or anything crazy like that so I
just went with a neutral look and again
taking noise it from GLA and this color
from Velvet 59 I'm just going to apply
it in the center because I couldn't find
my Jeffrey star I'm nude I think it was
down in my purse that's normally what I
apply to the center of my lips so in
this case this worked out pretty well
and I just Pat it out with mofongo oh
now you can't forget to set everything
so I'm just setting it with my mac fix+
right and last second
add dots across my winged liner beside
my winged liner and this is the final
look of you guys enjoyed be sure to
