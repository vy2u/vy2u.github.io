video is going to be this look to eat
all here in the thumbnail I really like
the way this look came out it's kind of
like a spotlight smokey eye cuz it looks
like there's a spotlight in the middle
of my eyes and other news this video is
a collab video Wow
I have a collab and forever in a day and
it feels so good to be able to share
another amazing youtubers channel so
this is a collab with Babs Beauty her
name is Stephanie and she has an
absolutely beautiful amazing channel she
does amazing makeup tutorials and she is
a blue eyed blondie the exact opposite
of me because I'm a brownie brownie
anyway she's gonna be doing a tutorial
using a more peep allit and I did
incorporate this little friend right
here I had the pleasure of meeting
Stephanie while being in Miami and her
and her husband are such true little
gems they're the sweetest people I just
want to be able to support other people
in the beauty community and I hope you
guys take the time to subscribe to our
Channel and definitely check out her
video I will have it linked down below
be sure to click it watch it like it and
then subscribe oh I didn't spray my face
with mac fix+
we're gonna jump right in and get
started I hope you enjoyed the video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you do enjoy first we're gonna start
with priming our skin I'm going to be
using the Porefessional by benefit and
this is the matte rescue so this is a
new one and it comes in this ginormous
bottle is ginormous a word I don't
really know and it looks like toothpaste
and it feels really cold like gel just
trying to give you a rundown on it and
it smells so good
so I'm just gonna put that much all over
now that that is done I'm gonna be going
in with the Maybelline Dream velvet I am
in shade at 75 natural beige it's very
whipped looking it Foundation and fluffy
and then I'm just going to pop that onto
my face and then I'll blend it out with
my Beauty Blender you can buy the Beauty
Blender that comes with it but I
personally like my own to do it with
better and I know that one I said
stipple and my
video and I know that when you're
supposed to swipe like I read the
instructions I just prefer this so much
better than that one just a personal
preference I'm going to start working on
that
eyeballs now that eyeball should be
using this morphe palette this reminds
me of it's called the 12 in B but every
month we have a small morphe 35o the 35
I was the one that's always sold out so
this is like a mini version of that in
my personal opinion first what I'm going
to do is just go in with like this
little shade right here and I'm just
gonna take this fluffy brush and kind of
blend it all over that I'm going to go
in with my favorite blush I can't get it
together today I'm going to grab a
little bit of this shade right here and
then I'm just going to blend that right
into the crease
I'm just going to grab the shade right
beside it and then I'm gonna blend it
right on top just to build up a little
bit of color that way we're not just
sticking with like one brown and one
light color on the lid that way it looks
nice and gradient as the colors change
the next brown color which is just the
next darkest brown color and I'm just
going to pop it right on top of those
shades you guys know the routine
next I'm gonna take this maroon brownish
shade and I'm just going to get some on
the tip of the brush and I'm going to
push it into the inner corner just of I
like jabbing the eye gently and then I'm
going to go sweep him back and forth
with a really light hand just just
smooth that out then I'm going to start
bringing whatever's left on the brush
and start sweeping it in that inner
corner kind of jab in my eye a little
bit too that's such a bad way to
describe what I'm doing
now that I look like I've been punched
in both eyes I'm gonna go in with the
kathleenlights where is the night not
the light these are rolling around
everywhere it's chaos over here but this
is her quad with colour-pop and I'm
gonna be taking Porter which is pretty
much a maroon color but this one came
off really Brown looking and I wanted to
look a little warm Moe Rooney if you
will so I'm just gonna get a bit of this
on my brush and again with the jabbing
motion just right on top just to give it
a little extra edge I often say the word
Jews whenever I don't have another word
to use it's just a really way of me
having a lazy vocabulary got a little
too much in that corner so I'm just
gonna take a clean brush and just sweep
that on out get out of there I'm now
intensified the black eye look but have
faith in me it's gonna look good or else
I won't post the video thanks I'm gonna
grab a little bit of this you weigh
cream eye shadow crayon in a serene this
is my favorite color out of all of her
crayons of our eyeshadow crowns and what
I'm going to do is just legit color on
my eye in the center being sure not to
hit that inner corner nor the outer
corner I'm going to drag it up pretty
far I'm going to do the exact same thing
to the other eye obviously because I
have two eyes and I want them to look
the same and I'm going to take this flat
shader brush this is an E 58 and it's
great for cream colors like this and
very lightly I'm just going to screw SH
this out and blend it that way like
there's not a harsh line in between the
two colors everything looks nice
next just to give it a little it's
another word I'm making up I'm gonna
grab a weenie which comes out of the
kathleenlights palette and with that
same cream color brush I'm just going to
pop that right on top these are
incredibly pigmented I
shadows now I'll grab a little bit more
of this color with a e45 this dumb
shaped brush I'm like opening my eyes
like this because the lighting is sober
right and I'm just gonna do the same
thing just to make sure in deepen up
that color a little I just like to go
back in and touch-up brush is really
great for the inner corner I should have
used it in the beginning in the inner
corner I'm strange reason I'm filling in
my heart that I should do some winged
liner so I'm going to take this more
feet light gel liner and an e 10 liner
brush from Sigma and I'm going to do a
very small wing I'm going to grab a
little bit of this pure volume a vixen
at mascara and just pop it on to the
lashes and now I'm going to add the
falsies but if you don't to add falsies
well then girlfriend don't add them just
load up on your favorite mascara and
devaluing them lashes grab a little bit
of my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
concealer in y31 this is one of my
favorite concealers you guys know that
this is like an F 70 concealer brush and
what I like to do because this brush has
such a nice flat synthetic edge I like
to sharpen up that wing and clean up any
eyeshadow on the outside of the lane I'm
going to spritz my Beauty Blender with a
bit of mac fix+ right and then we'll can
everything come down right here I'm
going to blend out the comb CV
I'm going to go in with a little bit of
my Laura Mercier translucent powder and
I'm going to set every where we put the
concealer literally just set my eyebrow
that's that's awesome next I'm going to
go in with this new palette from Gwen
Stefani and Urban Decay this is not the
eyeshadow palette this is actually a
blush bronzer and a highlighting palette
and I don't know whenever it's gonna be
released
I hope it's released by the time I'm
uploading this video but it is gorgeous
so I'm going to take this fluffy brush
from JD weighty 180 and let's see beauty
and I'm going to take low fee or lo-fi I
don't really know and I'm just gonna
blend this around the hairline and the
cheekbone I'm not really contouring I'm
just warming up my face now I'm going to
take a little bit of this color and in
e7d this is an eye shadow brush I'm just
going to contour my nose this is like a
subtle bronze color so it's pretty great
now I'm going to take this F 25 brush
and just dust away any excess Laura
Mercier setting powder go back in this
palette and grab an f40 brush and I'm
going to take I'm going to take easy
it's just so pretty I'm gonna pop that
right onto the apples and kind of blend
it back I like my blush to mostly set
like right up in here
I'm going to whip out another new pallet
on you this is the anastasia beverly
hills glow kid and this one is blame if
you can see by the size of my head how
big these are
they are ginormous highlighters and I'm
going to you actually I just feel like I
should mix these two this is Stardust
and this is crushed pearl
wait for the NRI I'm going to grab a
little bit of this shade right chair I'm
just going to blend that all the way
from the inner to the outer corner now
I'll take a little bit of quarter and
I'm just going to blend it on the outer
edge and then I'll skip the center I'll
do it on that inner corner now I'll grab
a bit of wienie a funny name I'm just
going to pop that right in the center
kind of making it fall right where the
top part is even I'm saying I'm going to
grab this little Marc Jacobs liner and I
am just going to line my waterline I'll
use this little bit of this new
Maybelline mascara and I like how tiny
the one is because you can get in your
lower lashes without bumping your skin I
just bump my skin I grab a little bit of
soar I don't know why I say a little bit
every time I'm gonna grab sore lip liner
by Mac and line my lips
now I'm going to grab stone by dosa
