going to be an accessories hall slash
fashion home I got some new stuff from
bauble bar which I'm really excited to
share with you guys I got the most
gorgeous pieces ever I also picked up
some things from forever 21 H&amp;amp;M and I
got a little thing from Brady Melville
which was the first time I've ever been
there and I was like overwhelming we're
really excited to share the stuff with
you guys that's just time you guys love
watching home videos well according to
you guys you do you tell me you do so
I'm assuming that you want me to keep
hauling you just gonna get soggy we just
gonna go through all the steps starting
with Bob Barr first of all this whole
situation is beautiful like the
packaging we mentioned we did not plan
this okay Omari has like this is the
most beautiful jewelry ever it all comes
in really nice black bags as you can see
right here and I got a couple pieces
from there which I'm really excited to
share with you so we're just gonna open
up the first piece which I already know
what this one is it's really heavy and
it's my favorite piece this one is the
room rib necklace this is like the rib
necklace I'll have every piece of
jewelry I mentioned linked in the
description box in case you're
interested but this is the most
glamorous glorious necklace of line it
comes in different colors but I went
with gold because I'm a gold girl but I
just think that this is the most
beautiful statement piece super heavy it
would be KQ when I got on today what do
you guys think that's my first piece so
excited about it the next piece that I
got was some hearings and you guys know
I love my big glamorous earrings so I
got these these are super beautiful
chandelier earrings and I think they're
kind of like a neutral color like they
don't have pink so blues or anything
like that so you can wear them with so
much stuff they're just they're just the
dad's old and they're fabulous
I just really love statement pieces of
jewelry though this is just another
beautiful piece from bauble bar the next
item I got with some bracelets you guys
I normally always have bangles on every
video every day of life I have on
or some sort of bracelet if you know me
you know I'm just like a bracelet
fanatic so this was a set of three and I
got all three whoops I got all three for
like you know it was just like one set
so the first one is super chunky it is a
I'm actually just gonna wear these for
the rest of this video because they are
the bomb but is a lion and they look
like you're trying to eat each other it
has little studs that go around it I did
get them an all gold and then the next
one is probably my favorite one it is
just a gold cuff and then it just has
little rhinestones of arrows in the
center we just gonna put her on and then
the next one it's just a little bangle
that has two pearls and I think they're
so cute together I think they complement
each other because they're so different
and it looks like you pasted them
together with your chic mindset but you
didn't they all came together next I got
another pair of earrings from bubble bar
which is another pair of chandelier
earrings but they're not quite as
dramatic they're way more wearable
especially if you just wanted to be like
semi patch or even if you had on like
like a graphic tee and then you want to
dress it up with a little pair of
chandeliers I thought these will be
perfect for that and again they're just
like a neutral color so you can wear
with so many different things these are
just another pretty pair of earrings
from bauble bar Oh lastly I got a really
pretty necklace um so this is my second
favorite piece I love the necklace so
much it's just very unique and this is
gonna be a long necklace I'm actually
gonna take it out of the packaging so
you can really see what she looks like
okay oh my god she's like so in here
we're about to have a pause this is a
tassel necklace and it looks like in
this it is a longer necklace but it's so
pretty I'm feeling I'm gonna have way
too much fun wearing this like this
gonna be one of those short pieces that
I never leave alone while I'm wearing it
and people are gonna get super annoyed
with me but this was just as such a
beautiful unique piece of jewelry I've
never seen anything quite like this
before and I like that it's long I have
a lot of short shorter necklaces and I
thought
that if I wore like a very plain top
that this would just just that top right
on up this is just such a beautiful
piece I don't know this may be my
favorite piece I can't decide between
this and the other necklace they're both
so beautiful
oh it might even be pretty if I like
tied it up chest hair and that's what I
got from bauble bar so I love that
website definitely check them out if you
need this young code too so if you see a
piece you want you can get a discount
off of it and I'll have that discount
oblique we're right on down below in the
description so just be sure to check it
right along onto forever 21 I did pick
up a few pieces of clothing from there
the first piece that I got with some new
short and they look like this and the
reason I got them is because they were
$13 on like they're a little short daily
or weekly sells I think these are so
cute they're an acid-wash like cutoff
shorts they're just super like old
vintage torn up looking short and these
are like my favorite things to wear
around like I'll wear something like
this all summer long and I have a pair
that is blue like blue jean ones but
they are so short they basically show my
butthole and I'm like okay like I can't
wear those ever so I'm hoping these will
be a little bit longer however they look
rather short but I'm hoping at least
they'll cover my butt cheeks because
later I'll show all that the next day I
guys rather boring I just got a plain
white tank top which I mean like I was
hoping to wear like dress it up with one
of these necklaces or something like
that because white tank tops get dingy
so easy and these are like a dollar
eighty from forever 21 so it looks like
throw in the bag if you guys even
understood what I said I said throw it
in the bags the next thing I got is
another top and this one was 1190 and I
wanted something fringy or different
that I could wear out and about that um
I don't know I always see girls with
these fringy shirts on and I'm like I
want to fringy sharing my life and of
course forever21 hats like a bazillion
of them and they're super affordable so
I got this one and it's like tille
tie-dyed and then it's got that indian
fringe on it the next thing I got was
another mm excuse me now their top from
there and guys are so section sometimes
I just buy stuff cause it's cheap and I
don't actually
/ one and I'm just like such good self
gotta have it I'm so bad about that if
you're bad about that you know let a
girl know that she's the only one but I
got this shirt and it is just like tille
and it has a little pocket and it's a
crop top and it's just a really plain
shirt but I like plain shirts because
it's so easy to pair with fun patterns
and again it was seven bucks it's a cute
little plain key I sleep on forever I
just like blew through that stuff lastly
/ these look huge on camera like I'm
looking at myself in the viewfinder and
they look like I have a size like 18
foot these are just cute again little
Indian Sachi sandals and they were 2250
I believe and I'm a size 7 just so you
guys know not a size 18 although by
looking at these you might think I am
these are just cute - we're out and
about I feel like these are great
summertime sandals I feel like I can
wear these with so many things this
summer so I could put on with my skinny
jeans wear with a dress and they have so
much detail and fringe on my figure they
could be like a statement piece to an
outfit you know now I went to H&amp;amp;M and I
don't have like the bags because I will
actually carry my little biodegradable
bags so I was like girl yeah I don't
need a bag to throw it in my bag cuz I
say I'm from a Chanel turned out to be a
total fail and I throw away the receipt
and I don't know the return policy but
looking at this little white tank top
here I have it turned inside out coz I
tried it on oh my god beats us on this
little white tank top it's just be
really loose and flowy and again just
another plain piece I'm really good at
buying plain clothes that I figured I
could wear all summer and all spring
long with so many different things this
is a very deceiving tank top because it
is so tight it's like the skin tight
around my top and then my boobs her life
it was horrible on me and I never would
have thought in a million years a plain
loose cotton tank top would look so bad
but it is so horrible do you guys know
the return policy
because I don't have the receipt I pop
the tags on it like things ain't looking
good for me I got a pair of black shorts
oh man about two pair of white shirts I
didn't have another pair of black shorts
and these were they have hair on them as
does everything in my home
these were 1295 and I thought such a
good deal they are a blue jean material
and they do come up high but I just
they're so cute and adorable and they
have cat hair all Oklahoma but the cat
hair does not come with them you have to
own your own cat and they have to be
shouting oh basically just a pair of
cuffed black shorts and lastly from
brandy melville I went in there I had no
idea what that store was I don't think
we have this in Alabama I've never seen
one in Alabama so it's just shopping
around lunch County and I was like what
is this little store it's like bombarded
with kids and I was like what's okra
Moulton I know but the kids in there was
like teenagers and then there was me I
just got one shirt because nothing in
the store had a price on it and I was
like this could be the most expensive
store ever I have no idea this is my
first time in there
and I bought this shirt and it was $12 I
was so mad I was like do you know how
much stuff I could've bought myself if
things are gonna be that cheap in the
store but anyways this shirt is folded
like this in the store and all I see is
Malibu and it was so cute just a plain
little Malibu sure another plain shirt
of course and I held it up and I was
like yes okay and then I realized when I
got home then this is the back of the
shirt plain like it's nothing says
Malibu in the back which is still cute
but I I really wanted to friend to say
Malibu I really wish I could grab like
100 of my subscribers and make y'all
goes shopping with me we would have so
much fun I promise you cuz I'm a crazy
person have fun I can assure you so that
is it for this clothing haul video I
hope you guys enjoyed hear me ramble on
about my new goodies and all my horrible
