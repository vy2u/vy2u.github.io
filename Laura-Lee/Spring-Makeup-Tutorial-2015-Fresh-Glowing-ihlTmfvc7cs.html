video is going to be this springtime
makeup tutorial this is the exact makeup
that I wore in my Mac Cinderella haul
video and a lot of you guys want it to
see a tutorial and I was like this look
is so like light and fresh and dewy that
it would make for a perfect springtime
mixes oil so here I am the very next day
filming this tutorial and a lot of you
guys asked for it so that was so awesome
thank you for requesting this look that
I have on here it's just something that
is so light and dewy and you just look
like you're glowing and bronzed and just
have that fresh face
perfect for springtime and I use zero
eyeliner for this tutorials I know a lot
of you guys get tired of seeing the
black winged liner so it is
gone in this tutorial I hope you guys
are excited to see it I'm really excited
for you to see it I hope you like it and
we're just gonna jump right in and we're
gonna get started to begin this tutorial
we're going to start out by priming our
skin I'm gonna be using the primer water
by Smashbox this stuff is pretty cool
and I have been liking it so far then
I'm gonna go in with my NARS foundation
first shaking it it up because it is a
super liquidy foundation and you gotta
mix it all around and then I'm just
gonna buff it out on my face with this
flat top kabuki from it cosmetics use
your fingers um if you want to or any
Kabuki brush but I'm just gonna be using
this one and evenly apply this
foundation all over my skin then I'm
gonna be going in with this Milani eye
primer I love this eye primer it is the
bomb and I'm just gonna apply this from
my lid lashline and up into my brows
that's going in with the e-40 blending
brush I'm gonna take orange smoothie I
am using all makeup geek eyeshadows by
the way but I'm going to take orange
smoothie and we're gonna use this shade
as our transition shade if you don't
have this shade like this just go in
with a cream color this is gonna help
soften up that primer and make it way
easier to blend everything I like using
the orange smoothie because it's super
warm colored then I'm gonna go in with
frappe and I'm using this dome shape
taper brush from morphe and I'm gonna
blend this in the crease notice I'm
holding the brush kind of upside down on
my lid working this just in the upper
crease area this also is just gonna help
us add layer and give it a gradient fill
and give us that warm filling I do take
a whole lot of time blending this out I
do cut some of it out so we're not here
for 5 years watching it but just know I
did go back and forth back and forth
forever to get it blended out really
well next I dipped just the tip of my
brush in mocha and I'm just gonna be
blending out in the outer crease area
and then working it in the outer V I
took the teeny tiniest amount of this
color because we'll go back in and touch
it up later I just want it to add a
little bit of depth to our spring look I
don't want this look to look smoky by
any means so next I'm going to wet this
little brush and I added in the
spotlight this is makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow and oh my god they are so
amazing and just look at that color
payoff it is it's astronomical
that's that's the only word I have for
it basically just packing this color all
over the lid as you see but just that
color payoff it's just up it makes the
look then I'm gonna go in with that
tapered brush brush brush and I'm gonna
blend out that crease area just because
I needed to smooth it out a little bit
more now we're going back in with mocha
we're gonna just deepen up that outer V
a little bit again taking a very small
amount because I don't really want this
look to look smoky I just want it to
look really soft
now I'm gonna take shimma shimma and my
highlight my brow bone I did add quite a
bit of this to my brow bone because I
want this look to look super glowy and
dewy and shimmery next I'm gonna pop on
some dramatic false lashes these are
House of lashes in iconic these are my
favorite lashes on the planet and I've
worn these like a bazillion times to
their shape pretty much to my eyelid
then I'm going to conceal my face and
we'll go back to our eyes in a minute
I'm just gonna apply this for age rewind
concealer which I like a whole lot it's
a little bit of a deeper color and works
really well for my skin this time of
year so basically gonna brighten this
under eyes down the nose Cupid's bow and
a touch on the forehead I'm using this
57 brush from Sephora which is an
awesome brush to blend out your
concealer I've had this brush for a
bazillion years that was so dramatic
I've had this brush for like three or
four years and it's just bomb and then
I'm going to be adding this new setting
powder from NYX I got this in my next
goodie bag and I just opened it up and
started using it and discovered that um
yeah I love it so I'm just gonna be
taking this f-35 brush from Sigma and
packing that on where I applied the
concealer so it doesn't crease and it'll
help everything last much much longer
then going in with a shimmery bronzer
rather than a matte bronzer this one is
by the balm it is beautiful I'm taking a
big fat brush and I'm just gonna bust
this all over my cheeks this is what's
gonna help us get that warmth to our
face and it's also gonna add the shimmer
and a little bit of a globe we'll go
ahead and add a highlight as well
because you know I can't control myself
with shimmer but I do love this bronzer
so much it's just such a glowing bronzer
next I found this blush in my blush
drawer from Revlon it is such a
beautiful nice blush and I think it
would look great on almost any skin tone
and I just popped that on to the apples
of my cheeks and buff it backwards then
I'm going in with Becca highlight in
opal I use this in every tutorial I'm
addicted to it and I'm popping that onto
the high points of my cheekbones I am
doing a whole lot of it as I usually do
but if you don't like that you can just
go in with a really light hand with your
favorite shimmer now we're gonna fill in
the waterline with a little bit of this
inner rim liner and you can use any
interim liner that you have I just want
it to keep anything black away from this
look because I wanted the eyes to be
super soft and light now I'm going in
with frappe
was that medium brown color and I'm
gonna bust that all underneath the lower
lash line area and I'm gonna take it
from inner to outer corner just going
back and forth soften it up then I'll
take a little bit of mocha and I'm gonna
blend that way closer to the lashes and
I'm only gonna blend it on the outer
corners to help open our eyes I also
take it up and connect it to the top I
shadow then I added in the spotlight in
my inner corners to awaken and give us
that bright soft glow now I'm finally
adding mascara if you don't want to add
false lashes at this point you just add
your favorite mascara I am using the
benefit roller lash this is an awesome
mascara and I'm gonna coat those top and
bottom lashes well really I'm just
helping the top lashes to is attached to
those false lashes but I do get my
bottom lashes a nice heavy coat of
mascara now I'm gonna go in with
blankety and this is just gonna nude out
my lips
um and take out any of the pink color
that's already in it and then I'm gonna
take the new gloss from Gerard which
worked perfectly for this tutorial
because it's called Spring Fling and
it's their new spring lip gloss and it's
just a light Barbie doll pink color and
I'm obsessed with it here's our final
look I hope you guys enjoyed thank you
