video is going to be this makeup
tutorial that wasn't where's the pouch
today tutorial is going to be a makeup
look inspired by the Vegas lights
palettes by makeup geek and this is the
limited edition palette but it's still
for sale on our website so I'll just
have it linked down below I don't know
about long it's gonna be for zona
website but it's still there last time I
checked so I want to go ahead and get
tutorial up using the palette while it's
still herself and yeah it's basically
just this warm toned coppery color with
some berry lips I just wanted to say in
the beginning of a video for once
instead of at the end of the video I
would love for you guys to follow me on
my social media I am Laura early on
Instagram and I have Twitter and
snapchat and I'm Laura 88 Lee on Twitter
and snapchat so I would love to connect
with you guys outside of YouTube so if
you follow me on those stop by say
what's up Laura and we can chat it out
and you know hang out be friends and
stuff like that so I happen to enjoy
this video and I hope you enjoy this
start off this tutorial have already
added my primer and applied my
foundation all over my face that we're
just gonna get started with our eyes I'm
going in first with desert sands was
just like a mustardy brown color and I'm
not being precise with this color I'm
just blending it all in the crease is
gonna be our transition shade and just
help the other colors to flow I'm just
using a big fluffy brush to do that with
then going in with one makeup geek
eyeshadow that's not in this palette
this is Coco bear and it looks a lot
like brown scrips just a really warm
toned brown color and I'm just going to
use that big fluffy brush this isn't a
40 by Sigma pop that in that outer
corner just to warm it up a little bit
more
now I'm gonna be going in with roulette
this is such a beautiful color it looks
like it's going to be a more cranberry
color but when I got it on my eyes that
turned out to be totally copper which
was a little bit of a surprise to me
but I did add mac fix+ spray and just
packed it onto the lid now this is a
really important step not just give it's
just to do a little bit extra blending
blending the lid color into the crease
color there way there's no sharp lines
and everything looks really diffused now
I'm going in with mirage which is the
matte like ivory color I'm just gonna
pop that onto the brow bone to give our
eyebrows a little bit of lift and to tie
everything together I'm just using a
little bitty pencil brush to do this
step now I'm going to be adding dramatic
fall flashes and I managed to get
eyelash glue everywhere these are iconic
I have the lashes they're super
beautiful dramatic lashes no eyeliner
with this look now I'm going in with my
age rewind and stroke of light the Adri
wine is a concealer which I'm just gonna
put that right in that inner corner to
cover the actual dark circle I'm only
doing this for coverage now this is
stroke of light this is just a
brightener it is so thin I'm just gonna
use this to brighten my face instead
applying a concealer all over my face
which can be really heavy makeup I'm
gonna actually just use a brightener
this is a lot like Mac's boost light pin
and as you can see it blends out so easy
because there's just such a thin product
but it also gives my pin a little bit of
light so this is a flat top kabuki brush
which are use from our foundation and I
find it really easy to use and simple
now your concealer with and it just do
the job done a little bit quicker send a
little bitty brush that I normally
next I'm gonna be setting this with
Eponine and powder from Anastacio most
of you familiar what this looks like
it's just a yellowy powder and I'm just
setting it quickly that way things don't
crease and this does help it to last
longer
now I'm gonna bronze up the face
definitely not contouring whatsoever I'm
using a shimmery bronzer and a big fat
fluffy brush from morphe and I'm just
gonna add this to the cheekbones and I'm
also gonna be blending it just around
the temple areas where the sunlight
naturally hits your face but being sure
to blend it out really well that way
there's not choppy looking or you don't
see any harsh lines you want everything
to be gradient this is a beautiful blush
by the balm it's called hot mama and
it's super gorgeous that look like NARS
orgasm by NARS it's just a peachy shiny
iridescent blush and I love applying
this to the apples of my cheeks
especially for springtime now going in
with my tried-and-true she'll by Mac I
haven't used this stuff in forever but
I'm bringing it back out this is a cream
highlight color and I find that cream
highlights last quit or any product
that's cream is gonna last way longer
than a powder so I just really love it
for the upper cheekbone now I'm going
back in with desert sands with that
pencil brush I'm just going to blend
that from inner to outer corner on the
lower lash line and then I'm gonna blend
it out with a fluffier edge of that
brush next i'm gonna go in with a
roulette and a little angle brush and
i'm going to pop this really close to
that lower lash line and then do this in
our tower corner as well again just
using a synthetic little angled brush
that way we do get really precise enough
in there then going in with bada-bing
which is dark brown i apply it to the
outer corners to open up the eyes and
make them look wire net big alone with
my roller lash mascara by benefit and
basically the only thing I'm doing here
is connecting my real lashes to my false
lashes if you guys don't want to wear
false lashes in this tutorial by all
means make this tutorial your own and
discipline Skara as you want then of
course doing a super heavy coat on this
lower lashes to make them pop now I'm
going in with my disk of colors barony
this is one of my favorite lip glosses
you guys I cannot describe to you the
beauty and I always make extremely ugly
faces when applying any lip clog so
please let's just bypass back but this
is just such a great pop of color and I
just really love the way it looks and I
wear it all the time
and
i order another one and this one is
liquid lipsticks that ends up drawing
that other way then at the end I said I
did want to fill in my waterline with a
little black liner and this is my Milani
and then I also did end up top lining
because you can see a little bit of my
skin color where the lashes don't come
all the way in and that was dropping me
a little bit crazy so I said actually go
in as you can see and like fill in that
inner corner right there that way
everything came next
and that is it for this tutorial I hope
you guys enjoy thank you so much for
coming to my channel I love you guys to
pieces and I hope to see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
