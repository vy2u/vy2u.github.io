good morning my little love so how about
that sun shining your eyes in the
morning burst off my videos starts off
pretty cliche I am on my palm checking
my social medias and can we take a look
at my phone what happened the screen is
up and it still works on me on Instagram
guys to keep up with my beauty world and
you can also follow me on Twitter yeah
you can chat with me on Twitter I love
Twitter you guys back and then I
normally spend my mornings blank with my
little yoshi she's on my channel so much
this channel should be called Yoshi
lately guys I got these new sheets which
are everything they're from Boyle and
branch and the for a really good cause
because every time you make a purchase
there they make a donation providing
victims of human trafficking with
shelter and education and hope so these
are 100% organic cotton sheets and I
adore them but the only thing that's
wrong with them is they make me want to
stay in my bed way longer they are of
amazing quality so I'll have everything
link down below with that next I like to
brush my teeth piece first to get rid of
that morning breath because we know we
all have it so I'm just going to brush
my little TVs and I normally bathe them
a toothpaste anyway else do this next
I'm gonna be washing my face I love
washing my face in the morning it wakes
me up a little bit so just using my
natural dreamers face wash I'm going to
scrub a face with my little scrubby
brush of everything that I use in this
video linked in the description box so
just check that out if you want more
information
so some mornings that I really can't
wake up I like to take a shower in the
morning I don't always wash my hair I
just kind of rinse and do like a body
shower and here's some of my favorite
products that I like to use the shower
or bathtub and then I don't I start to
get ready for my day my favorite
moisturizer right now is by belief it's
sold at Sephora and I just apply that
which is pretty much my skincare in the
morning I mean I have a few additional
steps some mornings but now I'm going to
go get dressed
a lot of the time I actually skip
breakfast which is a naughty habit but I
just never that hungry in the mornings
but I'm trying so hard to start eating
breakfast because it's our most
important meal of the day
so I didn't have my Cocoa Krispies which
you can see the look of my face I'm not
too happy about that because I Cocoa
Krispies thought Cheerios but that's all
we had this morning so I'm settling for
my Cheerios and what I normally do in
the morning time is try to fix myself a
little something to eat and then there I
am I love love love reading you guys's
comment I love xx you guys I love
communicating with you guys is so
amazing so definitely write me a comment
if you want to know anything or tweet me
and I love running back to you guys what
normally on summer days it's been my
time filming and editing because I
upload a lot but today I'm going to be
running errands and trying to get my
phone fixed and so I'm going to be doing
some pretty basic makeup for today's
looks just to get out of the house and
run all my errands like check my PA box
I'm going to go to the mall I don't have
intentions of going shopping I really
just want to get my phone fixed but we
all know I'm probably gonna do a little
bit shopping so yeah
here goes some basic makeup
every morning at BDO she her little
kitty trees and she's obsessed with them
look at her chasing me ha and then I
like to face lemon water I normally
drink like three glasses in the water a
day I know if this is my last morning
routine but my obsession with it hasn't
ended and how cute is this little
pineapple cup Oh mommy so much is from
Urban Outfitters now we are at the mall
I am on a mission to get my phone fix
you guys because this is craziness so
actually the guy the kiosk was like what
this phone still works like this look at
him he is amazed so while that was
getting fixed I stopped by Charlie's
daiquiri I love this place their
ultimate fries are everything and this
is Tyler's caramel macchiato ooh I
didn't like it but anyways I just spend
the rest of my day basically eating
cheesy fries and doing a little bit of
shopping you know I can't help myself
anyways thank you guys so much for
