video is going to be a sweat proof
makeup tutorial this was a very
requested makeup tutorial it's good for
summertime it's good for graduations
you're gonna be outside at weddings
events it's really hot sweaty oh honey
what you do not want to be caught up
there with your face melting off the
great tutorial that I can I go to
whenever I know I'm gonna have to wear
my makeup all day long or what I'm gonna
be in a hot sweaty situation I don't
want my face to melt off this is what I
do and it works I'm for real in this
video I'm also gonna be sharing with you
a really cool new product it's the juicy
shaker's by Lancome these are so cool
they look like little martinis and
they're like oils and for your lips and
they stain your lips that way you really
don't have to worry about your lip
product coming off coz it's a stain I
think it's so great for you know hot
weather or sweat proof so cute they look
like little martini shakers and you
shake them up to you them I'm just going
to show them to you real quick and then
it comes with a little sponge that looks
like this you can just dab your lips
with it and then in size just three
little holes where the oil comes through
the juicy shakers have natural
nourishing oils in them they have 20
beautiful shades I have quite a few of
them here I'll show you an overview that
way you can kind of get a good look at
them also give your a nice plump to your
lip and a glossy finish best thing is it
is a non sticky and non-drying formula
so like I said it's especially great for
hot weather nourishing goals I just told
you about they include sweet almond oil
omega-3 as well as cranberry oh and in
case you're wondering these cost $21 and
they are sold at Ulta Beauty so yeah hey
guys with you my favorite lip cocktails
with these and how that I use them so it
will be more than one lip look at the
end I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial please be sure and subscribe
before you leave we're gonna jump right
in and get started to begin we're to go
in with the benefit matte rescue facial
primer now this is going to help keep
our skin matte throughout the heat but
it's not going to make our foundation
last longer but I'll show you how to do
that in just a second we're gonna be
going in with the Born This Way by Too
Faced and shade sand which is a bit
darker than my natural skin but it does
match my neck and arms and all that jazz
just gonna blend that out all over my
face so the trick to make your
foundation last long
it's by setting it with a powder I
normally don't set it with the
foundation powder but in this case I'm
going to this one's my urban decay and
I'm just going to apply this on the face
I try to avoid the under-eye area
because I will be adding a cream and you
don't want to put any type of cream on
top of a powder so I'm going to be going
in with my concealer by bare minerals
this is their bare skin serum concealer
and shave light this is just been my
favorite concealer and it lasts for a
very long time on your face so I thought
it was just perfect for today tutorial
and I'm just gonna blend that out with a
Beauty Blender by dabbing it trying not
to move the product around too much
because we wanted to stay under our eyes
we don't want to drag it down too far
and the bridge of our nose and our upper
lip and just a touch other chin but just
be sure you're not adding the powder
first on all the areas you're going to
put the concealer as you can see I added
like the lightest layer of powder
possible once that's all blended out you
want to make sure that you're setting
your concealer just like we did the
foundation I'm going to use this same
powder and just press it into the
concealer that way it doesn't crease or
run away from us then I'm going to go in
with my trusty hoola bronzer and just
really bronze up my face my face was
looking really pasty today so I did kind
of do a deep bronzer but I love the
hoola bronzer it's just the perfect
shade for me and I just dragging around
my forehead my cheekbones chisel those
out a little bit I do a little bit under
my lip to just try to make my lips look
a little more more plump and I did
contour my nose off-camera now I'm going
to go in with a cream blush because
blush is always the first thing to go
whenever it's hot and you're sweaty so
I'm just gonna dab this on my cheeks
with two fingers if it's not bright
enough for you you can add a powder
blush on top in the powder blush will
last longer same method goes with a
highlight I'm going to be using to watch
that by benefit and it's going to last
so much longer because it's a cream and
not a powder like is it if it's not
bright enough or intense enough for you
and I just add some powder on top and
you'll be ready to go now I'm going to
go in with the adorable Too Faced peanut
butter and jelly time
talent okay couple in the lightest shade
in my crease as well as my brow bone
just soften up my primer and to go ahead
and highlight that brow bone and I'm
just using a fluffy blending brush then
I'm going to take the warmer brown shade
in the palette I'm going to blend it in
the crease it's really important not to
use 15 different eyeshadow shades if
your going to be hot and sweaty because
they all tend get mushy and blend
together keep it simple but I'm going to
show you how to clam it out anyways so
I'm just going to focus this brown color
on the crease kind of the outer corner
circle blend blend blend a trick I like
to do is to add a glitter glue onto my
lid and set up just an eyeshadow primer
it's so much stronger and it's going to
make your makeup last so much longer I'm
using Midnight Cowboy by Urban Decay and
with a flat synthetic brush I'm just
gonna push that right on top of the
glitter glue I am experience a little
bit of fallout then for my winged liner
I have a tutorial for that I'll link
down below and I'm going to add some
waterproof mascara from Too Faced we
don't want our mascara to run then I'm
going to take that brown shade and just
dust it across the lower lash line and
of course we're going to add a little
bit of mascara to those lower lashes to
be ba-boom them out I do have on falsies
if you don't want to wear falsies just
build up your natural lashes and it will
look gorgeous I'm also going to use the
Tarte in a room liner this liner is
really great for a lasting a long time
and it kind of opens up the eyes now
we're going to move on to the lips for
our first lipstick cocktail we're gonna
be using the Lancome matte lip crayon
and shade sought after and then we're
going to top it with the juicy shaker
and limit explosion this is personally
my all-time favorite lip cocktail as you
can see the ole and the formula splits
apart so you want to make sure to shake
it really good and what I like to do is
just dab it onto my lips like so and
you'll see the outcome is very pretty
mm-hmm
yes girl I love it
okay for our next lip cocktail I use the
matte lip crayon by Lancome and way
Montse air I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that correctly but I will
have a list in description box don't you
worry it's just a nice bright red color
and I apply that all over my lips then
to top it to give it a nice glossy
finish add it my juicy shaker and cherry
Symphony so that's it for this video I
hope you enjoyed be sure to subscribe
for will you leave and I'll see you all
in my next video bye bye oh wait come
back don't forget to set your face but
your teddy spray I'm using urban decay
