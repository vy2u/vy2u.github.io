reviewed it and yeah you'll have to
watch the video to see my thoughts on it
but I do love the way that I could came
out today I'll tell you that I
definitely switch it up and use so
colorful colors and I think they're like
even if you wouldn't think you'd want to
wear this to a festival I think you
would is just out Annabelle it's like a
really beautiful makeup look I even have
some bowling unicorn so I think that's
all I have for you I listed right Anna
and get started I'm really excited to
get started I'm going to try uses neat
art parts as I hands this is like a tart
scene video first I'm just going to go
in with one of my favorite primers this
is the clean slate the timeless
smoothing primer base those a lot of
words I could just get like a little of
this guys now I use my measurements and
tongue clicks you know this and then I
just smooth it on areas that have one
pronounced pores so my whole face I'm
just kidding now I'm going to go in with
medium sand in the rainforest of the sea
foundation so I'm just going to dab
this all over my face and then I'm going
to blend it out
we lonely playing with the unicorn
brushes but these are more so these are
for powder there's not really a
foundation brush I use my favorite
morphe foundation as the y6 it is the
gilded collection I'm just going to
blend all that salvation out and I
always just get my ears as well and I
drag it around the jawline and around
the neck okay now I'm going to go ahead
and start on eyes I guess I guess I'll
spend on eyes huh I'm so excited about
this palette okay so right here we have
the Tarte this is you make believe in
yourself this is the eye and cheek
palette here's the box it comes in super
pretty the back of the palette is gold
and then you open it up and you get like
a highlighter and I'm like looking at it
and not showing you guys oh here is it
inside the palette look look and as far
as the swatches lots of color payoff
lots of pigmentation I can't wait to
blend these out in my eyes and now we're
going to start to use the unicorn brush
they're very soft our legs good brushes
I mean I'm used their gold handle
brushes for a long time this will really
saw very thick in Brussels I'm excited
to use it I'm gonna start with a
blending one it's so pretty like long
and by the way the big ones still heavy
so they feel nice like luxurious bars I
might hate the color mist which is our
transition shade and kind of sad that
I'm making the brushes dirty because
they're so pretty yeah kind of like
breaking my heart a little bit and what
I'm doing here is I'm just going to
blend this in the crease as our
transition shade I'm just going to do
windshield wipers motions and then take
it on up and blend out the outer corner
of it so there's no harsh lines nothing
looks cray-cray like what I should oh
look do I want to do with about so many
color and I don't want to play with the
blue I'm going to take dreams and I'm
going to put that in the crease and like
focus it kind of low though not too
crazily
and then what I'm going to do to the end
is I'm just going to start swiping
outward a little bit to kind of catch
that outer corner with a little bit of
blue like a I'm gonna dust it back on in
like that and yeah we have blue eye
shadow all over I but I assure you were
to make this look really cute have faith
in
your girl Laura I'm going to make it
happen my my dreams come alive out of a
unicorn come out of my eyes today that
was weird
so I normally never blend out shimmery
colors but Coachella and music festivals
summertime springtime all the business
is right around the corner and I kind of
a place with you know some more really
fun pretty looks so I'm going to blend
these out once I get on some liner and
some lashes and the whole work this is
going to look very settled down so I
kind of thought I'm also tapping into a
little bit of mystic which is a silvery
blue color and I'm just focusing that
kind of that outer corner and in the
crease and then if I pop a little in
that inner corner basically if your eyes
look like they exploded blue that
potentially could be a good thing okay
let's move on and I take a little bit at
the Tarte shaped tape concealer and just
go on the back of my hand with it this
is in shade medium light and this is one
of my favorite concealers on the market
and then like a crazy post and I'm going
to put it on the center of my eyelid
like that I'm just doing it with my
finger and it's going to create a base
for a really pretty color that we're
going to put in the center of our eyes
to make our eyes pop kind of get that
spotlight effect yes
I just wanted missed something right now
that a hot cheeto staying to my finger
yes I've showered yes I bathed the hot
cheeto is going free so be careful with
those okay I'm going to take trance so
my finger I'm just going to pack it on
your finger again sometimes be your best
tool bone Bailey I'll just pack it right
on top of that concealer just to add
some detail to the crease I'm going to
go in with fairy and I'm just going to
like love that I mean right in that
corner right now another new product
from Tarte is the pro glitter liner you
get a glitter in a shimmery edge here
are a couple swatches of that metallic
honey oh my gosh I'm ending all like the
shimmery edge but I think I like this
shimmery edge more than the glitter in
what do you guys think I'll buy a shoe
which endows and wear oh that's the
glitter okay I am going to take the
glitter edge and just dot it on
and then Pat it out because I do just
want it to Sparkle old inner meaning
they're not there now I'm now going to
clean up YP and just dust the outer
corner off because I've blended a little
crazy by the way I forgot to mention in
the brushes they come wrapped in unicorn
tarp paper and here's the box that they
came in just in case you were interested
in checking that out and then the paper
is just the cutest I'm going to add a
little bit of that purple fairy color in
the inner corner because I kind of want
to deepen that just like a smidge for
liner I'm just going to grab a little
bit of my NYX liner and I'm going to go
ahead and wing it out when in doubt
playing that I knew I hit my nose with
that I should have brushed why did I
just leave that there you guys are
thinking what in God's name girl that
wing just went from zero to a hundred by
one flick uhm that winged liner is
pretty extreme and you don't have to
make your wing that big it just kind of
happened
so now I am stuck with it so high but
the eye look is looking super unicorn
and I'm really excited about it and hope
you guys are excited about a little bit
of a different makeup kind of tutorial
situation this is something that I'm
pretty excited about because it's the
mascara that this is mascara but this is
the original packaging of the lights
turn lashes mascara they have probably
been wearing for around eight years now
and maybe like seven or eight years yes
sounds like that and anyways a unicorn
side the unified unicorn aside the
mascara packaging is the same mascara I
think they should keep the packaging
like this because this is effort look at
this oh the box that came in in case you
guys went through the packaging and just
the black mascara and really fun
packaging so back in the day to always
pick up this mascara cuz Ulta in their
21 days old so we have it on sale for 10
bucks and I would wait and I would sock
it like an animal and then whenever this
stuff would go on so for 10 bucks girl
out with in yes so it's so funny link
you know my career is different and has
grown and change but yet he happy with
this scaring to still wearing it all the
time she's crazy
thank you changed helpings don't change
on me well she has eyebrows I rest on
lasses in just a second but I'm just
going to go back in with that tart shape
tape concealer and I don't have to use
as much as this as I do majority of
concealers because a little goes a very
long way we can take my wife's Express
from morphe and just tap this product
out and then in him a little to do
uniform brush here I'm going to go in
with a little bit of my setting powder
this one's my cover-up X let's set that
my Isis brush is very soft I don't have
a Tarte bronzer on deck so I'm just
going to grab a little bit Mylar Mercier
bronzer and a morphe 570 brush and I'm
just gonna chisel out for blush I'm just
going to grab a little bit of this pink
shade
I need a unicorn brush to even this one
I saw that so this I think I got way too
much product I do this all the time so
this brush is more dense than I saw and
like I thought it would be like thin and
wispy is actually a pretty dense brush
you could definitely contour with it
when Dow a bronzer apply you know you
can even apply like a highlighter with
it picks up a lot of product to be
careful with a bit it's nice to the
movie and then we're going to test out
the highlighter which is what a lot of
people get excited about next up we have
it the Tarte highlighter this knife
called spellbound glow and this is the
packaging it comes in I'm holding the
Box upside down
hi you open it up it's like a rainbow
highlighter but the shades are somewhat
neutral except for the purple shade on
the end here are swatches of the
highlighter shades
they're very pretty and if you can see
the purple one actually comes off as
more of a just pill shimmery color so it
is wearable you can separate them you
get four different highlights out of the
package or you can run a brush through
all of them which I kind of feel like
that's what I'm going to do I'm going to
take my morphe y4 brush and just do this
number it'll probably just come out with
like a light shimmery color because
they're all somewhat of a similar
highlight shade this is a really pretty
highlighter it is very light in color
though just know that when purchasing it
okay guys now I'm going to take audit
lashes these are icon lashes jealousy
and they are the lot of them so now I'm
going to take dream the blue color and
we're going to go ahead and finish the
lower lash line I'm going to pull in
this back and forth because I'm like
really in the mood to make everything
come to life I'm going to steal a liner
pin and where I was not rolling up guys
this one's broken
a broken one this one's in turquoise but
it doesn't work this is brand-new by the
way eyeing it to the waterline I try so
hard not to tap my lower lash line with
the mascara but it's so hard I have to
in a liquid lipstick shades this one is
festival which is a super pretty dusty
rose color and then they also have a cry
Christ fun color called a fairy tale and
it looks like blue first when I try on
fairy tale the packaging super cute on
the little brushy
so here is the blue color because it's
like such a vibrant color I definitely
recommend adding like two or three
layers of it to get the full effect and
like get this real blue color evenly
throughout the lips but once you do that
it looks pretty even and these arms stay
on really well and they don't come off
that easy which is a good sign they're
very kiss proof next coming up to on
festival a really pretty color so
actually first of all you don't really
have to add but like one layer and it's
completely even on probably because it's
a lighter more neutral color and the
blue one Fairy Tail you definitely have
to add like three layers to get like it
really evenly applied on your lips it's
a tip right there and then last but not
least I know you guys knew they had this
because I kind of sort of and was like
whoa and they were coming out with this
alright
this is Ready Set radiant this is skin
mist that smells like cucumbers and I
love it but if you can see like I think
you need to get it going better than
what I did I think you need to get the
pump bottle going because the fluence a
brand new one yes that's a little better
so okay so you need to get your pump
spray in really well before you switch
faced with it because I didn't do that
okay and last but certainly not least I
came about with spell bound sprinkles
this is body in space glitter it comes
with like this little pop top thingy
which I'll lose it anyway so I'm just
going to go ahead and throw it across
the room
and the glitter is beautiful actually
doesn't feel like glitter it feels like
a pigment it's very soft feeling like a
I should have pigment versus like chunky
glitter I mean I have to use this right
like Hello the quitter
come on oh the glitter itself is like
the most beautiful highlight and glitter
to my nose because I'm crazy oh let me
just fit all over my lips I'm a whole
fight turns into one big ball of glitter
oh litter on top of the liquid lipstick
are you kidding me oh my god that's so
pretty
I just turned this like pretty neutral
liquid lipstick from 0 to 100 real quick
I love the collection I think my makeup
looks great the palette is mostly
shimmer so if you buy it just keep that
in mind that it's going to be mostly
shimmering you might want to have some
map on dext you just have your nice
transition shade right here and if you
want to blend back with it this is a
shimmery eyeshadow palette the
highlighter is beautiful pigmented with
very light in color so just keep that in
mind with buying it but I love it
mascara bomb lippies bomb the brushes
are very nice I've had heartburn for a
long time and I know Nicole concealer
did a collab with them and her brushes
were great thar makes great makeup
brushes and oh I forgot about this but
we're going to swatch it this is the
liquid highlighter why did you forget
about the air tell what I like can I
have a lot of these it looks like this
it is so pretty and then I just squeeze
them out and look dear God I think I
like this better than the powder
highlight and more champagne little rose
gold going on there I just blended it
all over my hand so that's more so what
your face would look like with it blend
it it like melts and your skin looks
like it has it's nice frost to it this
collection is bright it's unicorn its
highlight it's glitter it's the whole
shebang so if you're into that kind of
situation
get into that situation this collection
is for you if you're not you might would
have have on this and get a more natural
tart collection but at first this is
like no I'm dead serious like madly in
love with it I'm so proud of the way my
I look came out I hope you guys are
proud of me for using different colors
not any neutral colors really on my eye
