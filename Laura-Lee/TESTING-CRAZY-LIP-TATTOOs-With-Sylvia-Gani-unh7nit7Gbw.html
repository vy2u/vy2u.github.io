slowly alright hey we are super excited
because we're gonna be testing out a
weird product we're gonna be trying out
lines with lip tattoos
violet lips someone that says I'm not
sure how to read I've never seen this my
love's is this strange and they're
really big so big like almost as big as
my lips at this point so we're gonna see
if these work we're super into it you're
just like trim them down we'll get into
that in the video on Sophie's channel we
filmed the blindfold makeup challenge
and she hooked hero up I did a pretty
great job she did honestly so good it
was least I thought I so good so go
check it out you guys you Lassie if you
want to mask out yes go watch that video
will be in the description box right
down below be sure to subscribe to this
video guys to this video so even now
event subscribe to this channel
subscribe to this channel not this video
you guys know we're getting crazy you
know I'm crazy
alright we're gonna jump right in we're
gonna get started oh it's for sir hi
Joanne in the video so we actually have
two different ones are you gonna do um
pink tiger or are you gonna do stripes
what do you think what I don't know I
actually kind of think this matches you
better I don't know maybe peek hey
you're doing tank I wanna do stripes
okay can you update the dirty looks over
your channel I'll accept it that's what
sequence yes you will
so what I got to do so see these were
just huge we were kinda reading the
instructions that were on the card and
they're just they don't clarify very
well they're pretty vague well not
really like there's any like simple nuts
but they don't make sense yeah I don't
make sense yeah so it says there's lines
on them you're supposed to hold it up
and like cut the lines but that sounds
like the shape of your lips oh well
you're like almost straight lines
yeah I guess we pop it out for time
let's pause okay first up pop out lip
tattoo if this is an actual like tattoo
that will stay on our lips for a few
days
I'm in a happy and punchy she has
business meeting yeah
she'll really love me then by the way
she's from Canada yes yes I'll say hey
there someone else tell me that's not a
thing really well not as much as people
say it's a thing okay but I do say a
like occasionally so cute okay and the
gay are you massage for this much
honestly
I feel like we should just trim to our
lip but and keep the Cupid's bow like
this see it's kinda okay right oh wait
why am i doing it that way why am i
concentrating so hard I can't get it at
the center okay like that yeah when they
just kind of trimmed the edges off
camera this line this is my line our
lips are the exact same shape so I'm
sure that this will work for bulton then
I have two pair of scissors I'm actually
I give you these handy-dandy
I don't mess this up you're not gonna
mess it up you're gonna do good there's
actually it's repair per pack so do I
really like where these lines here um I
don't know that like this I've got these
little lines on the side
Oh show Chile go and trim it cuz we're
not gonna need that much no yeah so
that's where we cut we cut but why is it
straight which is so stupid see that's
where the instructions through is off
because it's like the lines don't go
look I don't mind they're not a lip
shape no okay I'm gonna run and then I
can trim it from there mark these
scissors are just crooked you're setting
me up really on my fault setting I got
my phone or failure we'll try the next
step why are they making tattoos for
everything these days
I don't know IRA ought to know I shadow
tattoo for the lazy people of the world
again they're not messing with it
they're just gonna stick it on and live
their way I can't cuz this isn't even
pretty like honestly I did I don't think
I do do you like it you like she likes
it she's obsessed thanks for speaking
about my feelings yeah you know you just
know how I know
so then no it's like a tattoo but you
peel the plastic off my
big I think no I think you're just too
big Oh give us curved scissors to make
it extra challenging yeah I'm trying so
hard to cut this is just not working out
for me the good thing is if we mess up
we have three paper pack we do so yeah I
worried about that you have my babies
you will pro sure get this right and be
able to wear these out like you should
be so excited right now I don't know
about that but okay so then I said stick
it on like it's sticky cuz I filled the
plastic off you already peeled it off
why is ten steps ahead of me oh that is
a Midas touch are ya whose shush shush
shush shush shush are on his chest shire
treasure chest Shire I said it wrong and
he let me haha gonna be nice and pretend
we're because I wish I had this thing
like I hate when people correct me so
what is it I wouldn't want to know you
can't just let a head Shire I am in
common so like a shush shush ah they're
gonna read I don't know I was leaving
you were gonna let them read me you
weren't dead I needn't do anything
you're trying to replicate this at home

honestly they didn't do anything for me

eyelashes flicking off of them cute my
little eyelashes ish you're gonna look
