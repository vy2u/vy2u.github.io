have Bailey hey what's up and we're so
excited because today we're gonna be
trying out Instagram hacks yes I'm a
little scared the one that I'm trying
it's just bizarre and I don't know
exactly how it's gonna turn out I'm kind
of a tough once fishtail brow which is
like becoming so popular yeah I've never
done them I know there's so many broad
trends and I'm excited to see what you
guys come out with I've laid out some
products and I'm gonna be trying out
like putting foundation and mixing a
highlighter together on a sponge I don't
know what's gonna happen with that and
then we have some cool lip products try
out as well it is just like viral and
Instagram we're gonna see what happens
but also check out their channel because
we film testing out some really weird
crazy makeup yeah and stuff it's some
interesting stuff happened so we should
check it out and see what happened to us
because I almost lost an eye but it was
so much fun so be sure and subscribe to
their channel check them out everything
will be in the description box down
below just click there and chuckle malls
all right so without further ado we're
gonna sing the subscribe song and we'll
jump right into the video subscribe to
my channel
unique oh my god alright now we're going
to jump right into the video
and I'm not promising anything at first
we have a faulty get it going for you
that way it's all creamy it's she like
majors ok stay all like we come ok yeah
I shave it super defined looking super
good and then she just like went
straight up we watched a YouTube
tutorial imagine that so I learned about
fishtail browse while watching America's
Next Top Model because one of the
contestants always does one of her brows
fishtail yeah yeah I guess anymore you
just find new ways to be unique yeah
true oh my gosh I'm so scared to go up
have you guys gone up yet no okay Emma M
is your uh Kasturi oh yeah yeah it's
like I don't know like what is it like
okay your sounds pretty good okay that
looks like a little fish tub Oh like I
just accidentally like okay Mike what is
what is this straight up my face if you
like my fishtail is literally about the
touch my sister not the best out of all
of us a little like mine's like really
long I can go ahead and tell you mine's
too long so I'm gonna start we saw in
the video that people can fill the rest
of their brow off like completely yep I
think I just have too many hairs on my
brows are thick I feel like it's gonna
just disappear oh my
looks like I'm just wait okay thank you
Oh what she's playing us which is just
really not working out very well for me
but it's looking pretty good
the more I try and cover it than where
it comes out good like a full-on
foundation I can layer on here
that's literally me I'm chunks I just
don't know I'm supposed to draw on the
rest of the brow whenever there's so
much concealer it's gonna be like well
yeah it's exactly just not want to draw
great way so I leave like a gap into my
journal in the library it's so hard to
draw on all the concealer it does look
quite right
it's like a whole shade lighter lighter
lighter and then it's look how gray that
is and then this is like I'm having to
wipe off chunks of you taken from my
display yeah I feel like I'm just so
angry looking they're like devil brows
you know when they like are chub
yeah mine does not look like that it's
like two colors I bet she just shaved it
and then we just little mini throws it
up and yeah yep because otherwise you're
gonna get this discoloring on the back
half of your brow if you try to conceal
the whole thing I agree completely
okay so this was our attempt fishtail
pals
for the next challenge it's super
popular Instagram people are taking one
Beautyblender that's already dampened
and then pouring a ton of liquid
eliminator on it and then their
foundation on top of it and just going
in okay it's just like illuminate your
whole face yes wow I just feel like that
wouldn't wear well but I'm gonna try it
today so we have the Beauty Blender and
I have these iconic London drops so
they're so fun so pretty so they're
literally like oh I'll show you go I put
on the screen so you guys can see like
they put like a lot that's why I'm like
what the heck yeah okay here is this
gonna work this is gonna be so bad okay
and then they just put foundation on top
of it yeah that's what it looks like
looks like a nut no bueno company
alright looks like an easter egg
hey does likes gold painted Easter egg
oh okay it's like already bit taller and
it's like that's how much they're
putting dude this is like so much makeup
this would take me like a year to rub in
and blend out okay but it's like really
me like I've done the put illuminator on
first and then put some foundation on
top yeah a makeup tutorial and now some
people like that like natural shiny
clean glimmering look it also made me
and the fish so brow is just adding
today
guys this is insane and literally
everywhere I turn my face is like rotten
man I don't recommend this oh I just
need something I'm trying to make it
better work it work it okay next is I
have three lipsticks which these came
out I think Smashbox made on I don't
even know what shade I just handed you
guys what you get I got she got the nude
nude I got berry ombre let's see purple
purple and I got like red and orange so
basically it has like three stripes on
it and you're supposed to be able to go
like this and then they flipped it kinda
upside down I think and just kind of
went yeah and it like ombre their lips
but without the work and having to use a
bunch of different products so we're
gonna start like turning it upside down
because it's really not right like it's
not gonna go on unless you're a little
ombre backwards right
besides been getting like a hundred
percent out of why I don't like having a
dark on like the outside that makes me
feel like a mustache you know like
impossible purple it's like super
intense let's see oh yeah there it's the
bottom part of the lip that I think it's
a little bit difficult oh my gosh your
bottom looks so good it actually looks
really cool it looks like you took your
time and lined your lip just like like
soup did it actually works like they
usually they don't work yeah I saw him
do that Instagram because I had open
these I was like not gonna mess with
those and I saw the girl use them I'll
say trauma oh yeah
turned out better than my bottom lip
yeah - you can't really tell cause it
was yummy but yeah the new super subtle
version but I think we look pretty good
I give these like okay yeah I mean
honestly it'll be better to buy this and
buy like three different lip products
you know in line and live your mix so
like you could fix this alone you could
definitely like work it you know that's
is the only one that this is the only
one that works yeah really early bottom
line okay roughly looking good maybe I
should just walk around like this every
day
shaping my eyebrows oh this was so much
fun thank you guys so much ok torture
for you to do weird stuff on my channel
but I had so much fun with you guys and
guys don't forget to head over to their
channel and check out their video we had
so much fun filming it be sure and
subscribe to them and there also thank
you
of course of course and we're gonna go
wash your face and we will see you later
