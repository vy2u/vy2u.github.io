Network show many I did like Dexter's
Lab actually yeah I agree with you
Dexter's Lab was private hey guys what's
up welcome to my channel today's video
is going to be me testing out a viral
mostly seen on Instagram makeup and I
have some gadgets I have these silicone
makeup brushes and I have the cut crease
stamp for your eye and then I have a
bunch of really popular makeup that has
just come up
I have Kylie Hooda Natasha Nona Anasazi
Lee brands coming out with new stuff
that you guys have heard about and seen
on snapchat
I do story YouTube and Instagram over
and over and over again and a lot of
these products actually all these
products I have not tested out yet yeah
I haven't tested out any of these
products yet so it's gonna be news to me
honey since I am living my best time
life in this Cartoon Network shirt
comment down below your favorite Cartoon
Network cartoon from your childhood if
you didn't watch Cartoon Network like
noise whereas this thing is a soft word
thing this subscribes on anyway now
let's go ahead and test out this viral
makeup heaney
the foundation I have is a new
foundation but I'm gonna try out one
these silicone brushes from here also
Tarte came out with these brushes as
well I have two Pierre once on a deck I
have another point mint I want to talk
because honey I'm going to Japan and
I'll probably be in Japan when this
video uploads but I'm pre filming and
everyone else I'm going to come per week
and I have a meet-and-greet it might be
at tomorrow which will have already
passed I don't have a viral face primer
gonna put on face pop I actually let's
be real these drops are the most virally
primer on earth this this one hasn't
even been opened this is the volcanic
elixir which scares me to put on my face
oh they're like due to greeny oh my god
this feels like grease this feels not
good oh and it smells rotten
oh it's died
I hate it I hate it you would have to
get used to the smell oh my god it's
really strong okay I'm gonna use this
Becca ultimate coverage foundation I
really like this I tried this on the
recent video and I'm gonna put it on my
silicone makeup brush there's one pump
and let's see what happens
I'm just rubbing it in and it seems to
rubbing in oh I slipped it's very
slippery it seems to be rubbing in
actually really nicely with this brush
it's kind of hard to get angles with
this brush but I'm trying here it's hard
to get like around the nose the brush
does feel pretty soft like and brush my
teeth but on my forehead I find that the
foundation is going a lot longer because
it can't absorb it in any way I don't
not like this oh yeah a little weird and
hard to get around angles and like drag
it down the neck so that's the only
thing I'd be weary of with it but like I
could use this again it's not bad I feel
like it would take some getting used to
using but that's okay I mean that's with
a lot of products right try one of the
smaller ones with the concealer I'm
gonna be using the Tarte shape tape
concealer in the shade light/medium
today isn't this like the world's number
one concealer or like the you know is it
America's or the world I don't know I
just saw like a sign at Ulta I believe
where was like there is my mini one it's
a lot smaller than the other ones like
little spoons to eat with because it
doesn't like absorb any of the product I
feel like it doesn't push it into your
skin it just moves the product around
and that's the only thing I feel like I
don't have to get used to when using
these them on my eyelid it looks pretty
though I mean hmm
alright my makeup looks ooh see that's a
mess honey you guys are clocking me on
the foundation shade she's not that
tanned you see your neck so I'm gonna go
ahead and set set it and forget it and
then we'll move on to some other fun
products so here we have the magnificent
tropic palette from Natasha Tintin no no
no no no no no how'd you guys know these
are super fancy
I should have palettes very pricey I
picked this one up at Sephora I think
I'm gonna go in weed I'm gonna start
with pastel Mel
and then I'll go over to the pink shade
nudists now I'll go ahead and tell you I
do like Natasha gentleness mattes I feel
like they're really great creamy matte
eyeshadows now I'm going in with nudists
which is that like pink shade and I'm
just gonna blend it right on in the mix
this is the new remastered rose gold
palette from hooter I really like the
cover of it a lot I think it's gorgeous
and then you get these shades and it
looks like she changed the foil the
eyeshadows worn to a putty a shadow so
I'm just gonna take doll face with just
the pink I also have these little Kylie
X Courtney I should have palettes
something I'll be able to use all the
palettes today but I can at least show
you we can talk about it cuz there's so
much so much stuff honey so much Oh
struggling to get it all talked about so
I'm just trying to share with you guys
all the new new that's everybody's
talking about I'm really curious to see
if this cut crease stamp is gonna work
I'm gonna be honest I was gonna film
with her earlier but then I realized
like there's so many fakes out there and
it's kind of difficult to get the real
one I try to order the real one several
times and I couldn't get it ordered or
wasn't available and then whenever I
finally found it and ordered it came in
and I was like I don't think I think
it's like a knockoff version of it I
think it's a really cool concept because
cut creases are so time-consuming but
yet so many people wear them so we'll
see if it works although I do have the
knockoff Edition so that's annoying back
into this palette and grab sangria
I also wonder like if this cut crease
shindig is gonna work on my eyelid size
like does it work is it one size fits
all
like what's the T we're gonna find out
today you just gotta keep watching I'm
gonna take a little bit of man-eater o
which is the bright red shade in the
hooter palette I just want this to be a
little bit deeper right here in this
corner I've just been using it our 39
brush for all these colors so now what
I'm gonna do and this is it I think this
is the phony one I'm actually not sure
Oh might not be this might be the real
one guys is it do you see how you just
paint it and you can do a whole cut
crease or a half cut crease depending on
what you do but I think you're supposed
to paint
half of it I'm just watching this video
okay do you see that look at this video
guys they put the concealer on it
stamped the concealer then they pack the
eyeshadow on it and then stamped the
eyeshadow wow it looks amazing I'm just
gonna take some of the Tarte shape tape
concealer though she did half the stamp
and that's what I'm gonna do as well
seems pretty easy to paint I want to get
too much concealer on it because I don't
want it to get like goofy and gross I'm
really nervous I don't want to mess this
up okay so she like placed on the eye
and I feel like she held it there for a
second and lightly pull this got a
little messy and then I think he just
stopped blend that out a little bit okay
let's put eyeshadow on top so she kind
of left it like this and then packed
whatever color eyeshadow on top I think
I'm just gonna do this golden color out
of this palette and I'm gonna put a lot
of it on there like I'm just packing on
tons of eyeshadow like you guys see how
much I put on there I'm gonna just keep
packing it on okay now this thing is
fully loaded and my eye is sticky right
here so it should just fit and we're
gonna press and hold it oh my gosh wow
look at that
Heys I mean I wouldn't be honest is it
the cleanest cut crease in the world no
it is doable and so I'm just gonna take
the same brush tap that out I mean I
feel like it wasn't so high I could be a
little bitter but I'm impressed
let's do the other eye shadow can wipe
it off with just a little makeup wipe
it's rubber so it wipes off really easy
so I'll paint this half of my tool and
it does unscrew it screws on and off so
you could clean it okay here we go okay
now we're gonna put on a bunch of the
eye shadow right on top and I just pack
the eye shadow on top of the concealer
that was already on here and I found
that that worked really well cuz it
sticks it on to the thing but I pack on
a lot out of the eye shadow here I go
hold on I can't see I went blind for a
minute Wow okay so it just needs a
little cleaning up right here
Bowser so I'm going to go in with a
little bit of the mat and just blended
that worked out really well I can't
believe it
and I kind it was very I kind of I was
very skeptical honestly oh there wow I'm
really impressed with the stamp and we
have success in this video
it didn't have a virally bronzer so I'm
just gonna take the 8h pallet from
morphe and grab donut and go ahead and
contour up my face so we can move on to
some more viral / hide products the next
one I'm gonna try out is the dream
palette prom on associate Beverly Hills
this is a new palette I need to finish
in my eyes with liner but we'll do that
guys like crazy color highlighters but
whenever i swatched them which I'll show
you they aren't that crazy they come off
like in a variation of these colors like
do you see how they're all like almost
like not that they're almost the same
color they're all similar in color but
they come off like this is barely pink
this is barely blue and this is barely
orange on the pinky I'm gonna take the
brush that kind of came with the palette
and I'm gonna try out this yellow
sunshine color oh wow that is nice
that's pretty and down this cheek I want
to try a unicorn which is our more pink
shade oh my gosh that's really cool I do
that coulda palette oh I did put on
lashes I mean I might put regal with
just the peachy orange
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so I do
really like the dream palette there's an
example of three of the colors on my
face see you guys can see for yourself I
have the Buddha power pinks and then the
all-natural minis now anything hooda
does goes pretty virally oh it goes
pretty badly online because she does
have like twenty some odd million
oh and so I'm gonna try out one of these
I feel like maybe I'm trying out net
setter
I feel like this color was already
around though it's very pinky nude there
is jetsedder really pretty it looks like
a peachy pink and now I want to put one
of these nudes like on top of it I try
out girlfriend caramel brownie nude and
these to mix together I think look
pretty nice but not least it's gonna get
a squirt of some tatcha look what do you
guys think we used quite a few gadgets
to create this look I think the look
came out really gorgina I'm like shook
with the stain but I'm not gonna lie I
definitely will be using again I'll
probably use silicone brushes again like
we had a lot of good look in these
videos and a lot of time whenever I
travel virally stuff I don't live the
only thing is the first Ollie drops the
volcanic one smells so bad my skin looks
great with them on but it just smelled
so bad I just don't think I can do it
