all this hiya okay shall we get swatted
what's up guys today's video is going to
be me testing out really virally popular
but yet strange and weird products that
have floated all around the Internet's
that made people's minds go crazy and
everybody is super excited for these
products you have definitely seen on the
internet multiple times and I'm here to
crack the code to see if they are a
gimmick or not and we're gonna test out
all the parts today I have the 3d kabuki
brush I have a new rainbow highlighter I
have the pill off foundation the roller
wheel the roller wheel liner things like
that and yeah basically we're gonna try
it out and see like girl is it a gimmick
I'm really excited I hope you guys are
excited I'm excited I haven't tried
these products out before yet by the way
these are all like a brand new moment
for me and yeah I think we a brand new
moment for both of us and we could try
them out together so without further ado
we'll go ahead and jump into the video
but before we do that you know what you
gotta sing a special little song let's
sing it and we'll go ahead and jump
right into the video
you guys ever notice that whenever I
snap this hand is way weaker snapper
just sad pitiful but this one's going
strong honey this has been like such a
crazy week and it's Sunday right now so
the week is just started but I mean last
week was so Craig cried that's the way
way because we exposed my palate we
revealed it we exposed it we revealed my
palette to the world and the feedback
was absolutely on freaking reel and made
me really excited and it gave me just
such a joyous happy feeling so I cannot
thank you guys enough for that like I
absolutely cannot thank you enough for
that moment we're just chit-chatting now
and you guys like Hello is she gonna try
out the products or not I think first
off we should try out the whole pillow
foundation thing know what that
she is it's not a foundation it's a
product that you put on your skin and I
saw the thumbnails I thought though I
thought it was a foundation like my
brain was a little tricked and then I
realized it wasn't a foundation it's a
product that you put on your skin to
cover if you have a big bump or if you
have a situation going on that you don't
want the texture to show up and you want
to be able to put foundation on even if
you have like a lot of texture supposed
to be able to help you're able to rub it
on the areas let it dry put foundation
on top of it but then it pills off I
haven't seen the best reviews on this
product but we're still gonna give it a
fair shot here it is it's called real
skin patch this is gonna freak me out a
little bit putting it on my skin but we
have to do it for the tube it's just a
it's a clear gel seeping down my hand so
creepy oh it's like thick oh my god it's
very menthol II I think I have to put a
lot on for it to work just being real
like a good coating does so mentally
that it's kind of like burning my eyes
like the chemical like make my eyes
water water water water that's very
sticky it's drying fast it says it's
made in Korea I'm just trying to give
you all the four one one on it in case
you want to get it I got this off Amazon
by the way in case you're wondering
we're gonna put some on the forehead I
mean this could be a genius product if
you have like a big zit and your
foundation just isn't isn't having it
let's do the nose then we should be good
I'm finding it dry I feel very strange
with this on my face cool so we are
pretty much dry I'm now gonna apply a
liquidy foundation and we're gonna apply
my foundation with the 3d kabuki brush
because we're gonna kill two birds with
one stone and we're going to go ahead
and try out this interesting brush so it
just has a point on it it feels very
soft this is made by Sigma and it's
called oh sorry it's a forty HD kabuki
brush I was saying that completely wrong
it's like a little temple on there and
we're gonna put a go we are putting
product on it like oh it's so soft
though you can get up in your corners
Sigma is so innovative with their
products it's always really interesting
me interesting to me what they come out
with and it is gliding on top of the
real skin patch very nicely
until we got right here Oh oh my god no
it's not oh my god it's like starting to
uplift guys what just happened I like
the brush I like the brush I just got on
my lip what is happening with this this
this product well is happenin yahwah is
happenin trying to be really soft so we
don't uplift our skin touch oh my god i
keep on it literally just hurt me so bad
twice and I'm not being dramatic the
metal on this brush right here like
whenever you try to tap it's like
popping me in the nose and it hurts so
because it's you don't blend like this
with it you blend sideways you blend
sideways it is you know it could okay
what the hell oh this is just not good I
like the brush it's just that the
corners are super kind of sharp actually
and they're just like hurt whenever they
hit you because you're not blending
patting you're going sideways with it so
the corners are way more liable to hit
you so that's a little with the brush
but I don't not like the brush so with
that being said let me get it closed up
girl it looks like my skin is falling
off this is not the real skin patch this
is the fake skin patch so it looks like
some Freddy Krueger stuff right here
going on get that at that piece of
foundation this is just a freaking mess
I think more people think more people
got further along with this product and
where it was able to try it out
throughout the day but like it's just
such a freakin mess that like I mean why
would I wait to see if it were good when
I hurt it didn't even apply well with
foundation not gonna recommend a real
skin patch to you or the pillow a
foundation trending viral thing going
around I'm not recommending it to you
guys it's it was a flop it was it was a
gimmick it was a gimmick a bunch of
different versions of them some more
great some don't work at all some are
just like gimmick so we are going to try
this one out and see the tape I got
fingerprints all this mirror is kind of
making me disgusted looking
I'm like I'm not even OCD about things
like that I know some of my viewers on
your screaming right now at home you're
gonna throw your phone I know here I'll
cover it for you but just bothering me
right then and there anyways this is a
really light pastelly highlight this is
the box that it came in it says mermaid
glow on it and I have my why 36
highlight brush which we're gonna try it
out so I'm just going to flicker it I
think you're always supposed to do this
with these highlights okay it's very
subtle right now maybe let's get a
little more okay it just came to life
she just came to life I don't know if
you can see it is really pretty it's not
crazy but it's it's not even that subtle
either it's like in-between I'm still
getting pili off my face I can't stay
that I'm like oh roll it off it feels
like Elmer's glue coming off of my face
it feels like it's an in-between product
I think it would work best for a lighter
skin tone because as you can see I'm a
medium skin tone and can almost see it
like looking dead on however I did put
on a lot of product but I feel like the
highlight is in between a blinding
highlight and a subtle highlight it's
like that perfect in-between really
pretty glow it is rainbow but it doesn't
come off memo whatsoever
look at this huge it like hurts it hurts
to look at it okay I told you guys I
always whenever I get is it it can't be
just like a little pimple come up and go
it has to be the worst that sits there
for a week and Fester's and there's like
under the skin it hurts I always have to
be painful but do you see how it's like
perfect in between look at the pili
I'm screaming right now guys I'm
screaming on the inside get off of my
face what did I do to deserve this huh I
think the highlights pretty I do not
think this I put too much on my nose she
do know I think this highlight is a
gimmick don't go in with too much I
think it works best on a lighter skin
tone um I put a little too much on hey
hello crazy I normally do that anyways
but it's pretty you know it's like
pretty next we have such an interesting
product we all know that this has just
been talked about so much
was reading up on the product and they
really say that this park is good for a
couple of different things like for
artsy eyeliner mostly for like a thin
liner across and you could do a wing
with it but I I see that that line I was
mostly made for just like thin liner so
if you don't know what it is let me
actually show you it is an eyeliner but
it's on a little wheel in the wheel is
supposed to just like roll oh my God
look at that roll across your eye like a
little car wheel like and you're
supposed to be able to get some line up
out it's a very interesting product and
what I'm going to try to do is create a
thin winged liner I can't get it off my
face cuz it's hard to see here we go
oh my cute blinking so I drew a straight
line across and a lot of I was surprised
I get how black it was and like the
quality of the actual liner is really
nice this is a slightly gimmicky but let
me just keep trying it just be honest
like I feel like this just made doing
wing liner a little bit difficult
here's trying to regular liner with it
it's not that bad but if you're like
trying to a wing with it it's actually
really difficult I'm just struggling so
hard on over here with it and I just
can't get that sharp point in that I
want out of it it's a very difficult
liner to use also it is very very black
so I like that about it but it shines
shimmery and shiny
I don't like shiny eyeliners I've said
that so many times on my channel I don't
like it it's a gimmick it's a gimmick
I'm not doing this
next I have an interesting product from
Winky lugs this is a newer brand it may
be newer but I haven't really used their
products before and these are like pill
lipsticks they're also like the tiniest
lipsticks ever and if you can see you
roll them out and the lipstick too so
this is what they look like how cute are
they want you to be able to visualize
the shape of a pill I do wish that the
end of it wasn't round it's kind of hard
to like get around the corners in your
mouth but oh could you imagine trying to
find the same purse how funny are these
I think they're so cute also I love
little things I just think it's the
cutest thing in the world and things are
teeny tiny or like sample size of things
I just love it no matter how practical
it is so here I God look at that
pigmentation from this little booger
this is like the most power punch in a
little mini I've ever seen one little
problem with that I find that it's so
hard to get it see how it's like rigidly
it's like really hard to get it smooth
around the lips because of the shape of
the lipstick so let's try another color
I know that was a bold color so he will
try the lighter pink color in it okay
here we go
doable you can definitely get it right
you just have to take a lot of time is a
little hard to hold because it's a pill
form but it's so freakin cute and I
don't hate it I like them these are not
a gimmick I mean they look great I'm
gonna take this off because we have
another cool product to try out and this
is our last product to try it's another
lipstick that's why I keep wiping my
mouth and guess you're wondering why I'm
like it's for a reason I found off
Amazon it came in with like a broken
tube which was like cracked and
interesting to me and I think hey this
is globe me up lipstick and it is
supposed to be a glow-in-the-dark
lipstick I got the shade of violet so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna film
this part my iPhone to apply right here
and I'm gonna go in my closet where I
know it's just like the darkest and then
I'm going to turn the lights off close
the door and we're gonna film and see if
I'm glowing in the dark there we go got
it open super purpley but the tubes like
faulty look oh there goes it stays up
all right who cares this is a
glow-in-the-dark lipstick I think this
is supposed to be like really cool so we
will ignore the packaging
I've played a lot of layers of it
because it went on a little bit thin so
I just went back and forth you just
apply a lot of layers so let's go in the
closet and check it out guys we're in
the dark as you get I don't know if you
can see me hello in the dark and it is
not glowing in the dark it does not work
this is one or two a flop this is 100%
of lon
you should know guys that is it for this
video we tried out a bunch of weird
products some were actually a lot were a
gimmick today but we did have a couple
products work out and my liner looks
like it but anyways thank you guys so
much for being here I'm watching I
appreciate it be sure to subscribe to my
channel
yeah link and I will see you on the next
video do what you made me do
