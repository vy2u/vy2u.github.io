welcome to my channel today's video is
going to be about dread sore thumb dish
ah I don't really sing my intros I don't
know why I just feel like it makes it
all jolly happy and worth watching right
okay
now I've made many videos in the past
talking about foundations but I still in
my comment section gets so many
questions about trucks for foundations
what's a good one yeah so I'm going to
be telling you good drugstore
foundations for dry skin oily skin or
skin combination skin whatever you got
I'm pretty sure I have a recommendation
for you some of these products I've
mentioned so many times on my channel
I'm going to mention them again because
it's just truly my favorite also pear
just kidding guys you know I'm not that
brave I bought a fake nose ring because
I wanted a nose ring without the
commitment so yeah they're actually
really affordable and cheap on the
internet so I was just like you know
what I'm gonna buy a nose ring so I did
there and I am kind of obsessed with it
and it kind of makes me want to get my
nose pierced but I'm totally not that
brave Oh Kudo see you guys have gotten a
piercing on your face I'm just not brave
enough to do it so here I am with my
fake nose piercing makes me look cool
just pops right out it feels like I have
a big booger in my nose I just want to
pick it honestly but besides all that um
one more announcement be sure and enter
my big giveaway I'm giving away a
MacBook Pro GoPro one of those little
insect cameras um I'm doing away beats
by dre and my big holiday giveaway I'll
link that video down below is super easy
to enjoy just check out the video be
sure and enter that and without further
ado subscribe to my channel and without
further further order we're gonna jump
right into the video
let's get started go I feel like I'm
going to start with the foundation that
you guys know I'm gonna talk about that
way we just get it out of the way this
is the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless
I think that this foundation right here
is one of the greatest drugstore
foundations ever invented I am really
this is for normal to oily skin too and
I stand by that it is for normal to oily
skin I'm not really for foundations that
have super super super matte like math
and
where you kind of look like I don't know
I was looking for something to describe
that and I'm not doing well I'm just not
up for that I like a little a little bit
of doing this sometimes just like a
touch and this is really nice if you
have oles skin and you're dealing with
your natural glow enos this will not
enhance that whatsoever but it's just
not flat and that looks crazy and fakey
makeup on but it has a really nice
natural finish it's an all-around great
foundation medium coverage I am a show
you to 220 and I do love her so much and
recommend her and it's like seven bucks
of the drugstore super affordable makeup
here next one I'm going to talk about is
a new one that I have discovered that's
been out for a long time and it's like
Laura where girl girl where you been
what have you been girl I discovered the
Revlon Colorstay foundation literally
one of my holy girls now I use this
foundation all the SHAC auto charm all
the time
shade 310 is like this much too light
for me in a few more months winter is
approaching us and it will be my shade
this is for combination skin I think if
you have old lay skin it also looks
really nice in your skin it's not full
coverage at all and I wouldn't even
really say that it's buildable it's more
of a medium coverage and I feel like if
you build this one up you're going to be
dealing with too much makeup it might
have a little bit of a mess on your
hands but for work for school everyday
life this is an amazing foundation it's
not too heavy and it plays well with
other products have you ever dealt with
the foundation like you put on the
foundation you like everything you put
on your concealer and powder and all
that and it just doesn't play well with
other products this one plays very well
with other products and I highly
recommend her to you this is very long
wearing as well this foundation got
mixed reviews and I don't know why
because it's another bread-and-butter
foundation for me this is the Milani
conceal and perfect two-in-one
foundation and concealer I do not use it
as a concealer but if you're not into
adding a lot of concealer but want full
coverage this will be your bread and
butter everybody was complaining about
it oxidizing and that happens that's
whenever a foundation once it gets out
into the oxygen the color of it
accent and color of it can change a
little bit darker so I am in shade 0.55
in shade 0.5 and it doesn't really
change on me this is warm beige this is
a very full coverage foundation it's not
light sheer or medium I would just go
ahead and call it full coverage and
truth be said I'm on camera a lot
obviously and when you're on camera the
lights and all blow out your foundation
so whenever I film you tube videos I
normally opt for a full coverage
foundation because if I don't it kind of
looks like I'm not wearing a lot of
makeup by the time the flash or all the
lights come down on you it just like
washes out your makeup so a good
drugstore full coverage like girl
Instagram beat face slate snatch beat to
the gods you're gonna go with the Milani
perfecting conceal it's gonna get you
there mmm-hmm if you're having some skin
issues and you want some things covered
I just love this this is an all-around
great foundation I highly highly highly
recommend her I didn't have any bad
problems with her at all I didn't even
have the oxidation issues so I recommend
that once I did the light just get
darker oh god is that you I'm gonna be
talking about the L'Oreal Lumi cushion
and I mentioned this one rather than the
one in the glass bottle because I like
this one better actually this is a
foundation that I haven't worn in a long
time because I normally opt for these
type of foundations when it's a little
bit cooler outside and there's no chance
I'm going to get sweaty and greasy
because this is a lumi foundation and it
has the potential if you've only skin to
enhance your natural glow meaning you're
gonna look like greasy fried chicken if
you're not careful okay it is a shear to
medium coverage depending on how much
you put on I don't like to put a lot of
this on because it is illumi and you
kind of get the glow already and I just
don't like to add too much of products
that enhance the glow because there's
like a fine line between she's naturally
glowing and girl was your blotting
powder adds as I I typically like just
one layer this and I'm happy I wear it
in the winter months if you have dry
skin you can wear this year-round and
you will be obsessed if you have normal
skin you'll be obsessed it's just a good
good good good good foundation
it does play well with other products I
definitely recommend it I like the
cushion form better than the liquid form
x1 that came out this year this is the
L'Oreal infallible Pro Glo to me I think
it's pretty similar to the lumi again
it's good for dry skin to normal skin I
wouldn't wear this if you have oily skin
I wouldn't recommend it it is very long
wearing it's more long wearing than the
cushion foundation this one does have
sunscreen in it so if you know you're
going to be out in the Sun or usually
the extra protection your skin I would
offer this one this one I do not believe
it has sunscreen in it
I'm sure someone in the comment section
will correct me if I'm wrong but I'm
pretty sure this one has no sunscreen in
it so you're not going to get any sun
protection from this one where is this
one it's going to help out with that and
it is a shear to medium coverage
foundation really good stuff right here
okay guys my last foundation I want to
recommend to you guys is the fit me
matte and poor y'all already talked
about that this is the dewy to smooth
skin this is the fit me it has a lot of
sunscreen in it so if you're going to be
taking pictures and stuff this is not a
good foundation I recommend the Milani
for pictures because it's more full
coverage and without the sunscreen but
this one again is too dry to normal skin
and it's really beautiful I love again
wearing this during the cold season
where this looks like Bloods on it but
really it's just a lip liner blood on it
and I'm not gonna wipe it off because
I'm lazy so weird she's so weird yes I
am one baby complaint and I don't know
I'm sure this lowers the price by them
just leaving the bottle with a screw-off
lid and not like a pump on it but I
would appreciate a pop just going to
throw it out there
Maybelline do what you want with that
information I like a pump if it keeps
the price cheap or don't add a pump but
I like a pump these are truly highly
recommendations from me whenever you're
at the drugstore and you're looking for
something affordable I hope these
recommendations help you out also on my
channel on my snapchat on all my social
platforms I am working so hard to
implement more positivity into our lives
and I just
want to encourage you guys to go out
into that crazy world out there and
compliment someone today if you like
that girl's lipstick girl just tell her
if you like the shirt she's wearing said
girl you look good in that shirt where
did you get it was it on sale
oh you borrowed it from your mama okay
nevermind damn but it's cute it's cute
girl go out and compliment something
because in my brain when someone has
walked up to me a stranger I don't even
know has complimented me on something it
has hung with me I really like your hair
that long well it kind of puts on my
head maybe you should start wearing my
hair longer makes me feel good yes I
look good like this and so maybe we can
you know women's women men's men
people-to-people we can come together
compliment someone it could really lift
their day you don't know I mean nothing
bad is gonna come from you complimenting
someone so I just want to throw that out
there throw it out for Hill it is I
don't know what I'm doing now I want to
put that out there it's just like a step
in taking positivity into your life
putting into someone else's life and
paying it forward I love you guys thank
