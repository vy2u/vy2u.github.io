special guest hi guys welcome back to
Laura's channel welcome now the thing I
love about Laura is that you never know
what the hell you're gonna get when she
comes over because he has so many crazy
products to try hey what are you getting
me into today something out of the
chamber
okay hidden some hidden salvation and I
have found this is a new brain at
Sephora I don't know how to pronounce it
a hundred percent 22 see you is 22
system da HOF un gah okay we're gonna
let you pronounce that out huh huh you
know we bought it all
okay so just under 22 all right okay and
so the description of an online was
called been hidden foundation I'll high
girl about the Travis at oh wow it's
from Korea okay so it's made in Korea so
if you guys look closely right here
there is a little lid now every product
any beauty part legally has to have it
on a package change and it is basically
called the period of opening meaning
once you open the product this is how
long you have to use it until it expires
normal things are 12 to 24 months this
is six months so grow either it uses up
or you ain't gonna happen this have a
very short lifespan does so and you only
what I was reading some reviews just
kind of see what people for people were
so cuz if you get so little amount of
product ah okay let me look here so you
get 0.34 ounces okay i've been trying
out so many foundations most standard is
one point zero to one so that's like
literally less than half like look at
this plank for one one fluid ounce so
one fluid ounce 1/2 an ounce of lemare
to a pro glow one slow down so literally
doesn't matter if it's drugstore high
end
Wonder Woman L amount is one so this has
0.34 no I know that
oh we're mind you now this foundation
was how much Wow well almost a shop girl
she was $38 and there's only four shades
another time or so please show this is
website that's right right there for
shades $34 do you see why I'm calling
Wow it's crazy I got you porcelain
micropore puffs that will set stores an
ultra light foundation for glowing skin
feels like a light coverage comes dear
life Darren give me some light garbage
you're gonna seek money out it like
separate okay so how does it look look
at some boxer comes in a tin can with
some trippin girl oh I forgot I have
money yeah I gave him the box like
because I had already opened my present
had to see it so it comes like this why
is your lid yellow am i pink
Oh interesting huh okay well it looks
like one with the care wax like a fog
okay now I want like flick down my hair
so it comes with a sponge on the inside
that looks like this now there is
already kind of steaming out and then
will Sheffield show us to have like a
sticker to peel off
give me discs that say I will hunt you
down like soybean as if his pant for you
if he's in my birth control everybody
should get really open and choose like
normal nails I can't get it crispy given
combination like this they were for
melted honey oh my god and now we're
sharing okay so we got it off of his
nail gouges are those yours carminative
you can finally get it open it looks
like this what I'm do I have a mirror oh
we have a mirror in the lid come here it
has a piece of plastic over it so you
just gotta like um yeah yeah and I don't
know how you got that quickly there
we've got it
this is what I want them to see you look
at so you pull that off and then the
foundation is in here in there whoa
right stretching of puff cover by force
or with fingernail may result in
splitting the puff so I'm not touching
that
no you're not oh my god okay so it comes
like this and how does it work
this little piece too you peel that off
alone okay it's like a mostly little
condom the foundations are any other
you're telling me yep and I want to see
it yes CeCe
so do a little yes there you go there it
is oh my god yeah
Oh weird okay now you're gonna pull off
your thing okay so it just goes like
this
whoa crazy right and look and there's a
donation foundation so today if hidden
is like a new concept of the puffin
foundation that controlled skins texture
and correct tones with a foundation
formula which is filtered and condensed
through three phases
I cannot believe able to read all that I
knew it hahahaha texture so thankfully
if you don't your porcelain may be right
okay so basically wrap the enclosed puff
cover fold the puff and half to pick up
the content and gently press okay so
we're going to pop it on it's like just
a quick coating on a claw wrap your
fingers mm-hmm if she is okay so what we
just fold it in half now I'm kind of
nervous no no no we forgetting because
we're just so excited to try this timer
oh my gosh
farik now I know she's the same way on
her genesis her channel okay so whenever
we both try things out we always do a
normal routine so I only think it's fair
to put on primer so let's grab for
primer $200 I'm gonna fuck with the
prices this is the best primer I've ever
use on the planet I'm gonna say it right
here in Laura channel
give me a damn don't be stingy okay so
before when I was over here last time oh
yeah where do you work you buy this like
oh my beauty wish calm I like telling
Neiman's or this one is so tacky if the
foundation looks bad with this primer
you know the butter is not good cuz
we're doing it although great we're all
right here
yeah we're giving you it we're giving
you a little extra boost so this product
flop a dependent and let it attacks for
a second and then you're good to go
almost my skin's khaki - Kay
me yeah fold it in half to perfect the
content and gently press so pull in huh
okay my god and then squeeze baby oh
yeah huh oh my god it's coming out and
then gently press like a little older
mine where's my look like what does my
look like hahahahaha ok let me press a
little more anymore product though yeah
I just wheats out right how does it come
out yep oh okay okay we got them out now
it says two after the content appears
from the center lightly pat on your
cheeks forehead nose and chin use the
edges of the puff to pat outwards on to
your skin all right let's keep the
mirror that it came with oh my god
there's product coming out how cool oh
now it looks like my dog goes to the
bathroom okay we're trying this we're
glad we're going in let's do one little
area to happen oh wow huh a lot of
products came out it sure did oh my god
more later
Oh what have I done good huh oh I want
too much it looks a little bit crazy
like right out the Bell
yeah there's like a lot coming out a lot
maybe I put too much on
sorry system blend this all the way out
or do you use like a brush oh I actually
don't know but I feel like the more I
try to blend the more prominent comes
out yeah so that's probably not a good
look oh wow my pores are like they're
holy for today didn't know they existed
look at this look at how its quad
relating on my chin right here oh yeah
cuz as you're patting it and you guys it
is coming more product is coming out so
I think I want to distribute it and then
we should blend it with a kebab yeah
whatever you color match me great thanks
girl I did the best I could
matt'll for fucking shade oh yeah valium
for shades which is a major downfall in
my opinion so I'm just going to oh my
feet is a little light for me and yeah
I'm not going in that much here let's
try to use in half alright let's see
what happens with this
I'm just going to cover my lip gloss
with foundation this is so much better
like if you just blend it with this huh
huh Wow okay it's kind of tacky huh okay
you never have light coverage ah ah so
not like this hey honey I'm like an
all-white holy and especially dry down
and it is not like to move that easy no
this brush is amazing and it's helping a
lot 100%
okay what's good many fucking inlining I
definitely don't think that this is like
a sheer foundation whatsoever well they
made this who thought light on the
packaging was going to be a good idea
how do you think how do you think of
this sentence what do you think how do
you think what is with my brain oh wow
this is a little heavy and it feels
really sticky
through that correlation yeah oh yeah Oh
like you don't think I'm going to do
even yeah that is light for you
so I come still blending I'm like really
trying here yeah let me go on to bigger
mirrors to really feel it am I never
light for me and I got this I think I
got the second to the darkest shade well
I think it feels really heavy I can
imagine it wearing them well and I think
another downfall with it is for shades
and another downfall is the amount
product you get for 38 bucks I mean the
price point is ridiculous right okay I'm
like really looking here I'm like huh
but I told this area was really pretty
look under my eye don't ride like crazy
I'm going crazy in there yeah wonder how
you're supposed to blended I would do my
hair the whole time no was it sticky wow
yeah it's not the primer that's not
tacky this is a sticky young no this is
definitely the foundation I'm pretty
intense and kind of hard to get blended
out yes I don't know how you would have
blended it out there's no there's good
network would just keep coming out right
get that weary and then you have like a
faithful one half your sponge is gone
great it looks really pretty on you now
that it's drying it's a little already
crazy uh-huh I know we haven't found
powder anything but fuck man I'm like so
that kind of still blending an hour
later I'm like I don't know if I
yeah it's kind of hard to get with it
l-like sticks to your skin my pores are
filled now but that was a little rough
those are rough start
rough start now it's been about what he
would just like five minutes yeah and I
don't hate it
I don't either if used to my fingers
it's still really tacky like it thank
you right here so it felt that way
putting it on it kind of takes a long
time to dry and you have to point it out
quickly
yes but now that it's dry I think it
looks prettier than when we first apply
it that was a little scary yeah so let's
do some concealer and powder and to see
how the Clark lids on our face yes tell
me why this is not the best thing for
concealer like I died for this brush I
have that exact brush and I may use it
and listen to it by someone else
uh-huh my channel okay keep not gonna
lie mm-hmm
it doesn't look like a heavy foundation
believe it or not okay we'll say this I
don't know why my chin is a little more
cakey than the rest of my face but like
under-eye it's not bad looks pretty huh
oh yeah it's like smooth honey baby food
is no ritual getting into my smelling
which is nice no on it
I'll just Pat my powder under the eye my
bad little Columbine he looks really
pretty it does like luminous right like
you to you looks like velvet oh wow my
very velvety higher sternum I mean where
I didn't put the powder a lot feel
sticky isn't it feel great here
oh look at that yeah no light cover I'll
try this actually has a lot of coverage
without the powder like it having local
coverage to it like you can't even see
my freckles you kind of a damn attitude
oh shit
I think you look really pretty your skin
looks very velvety keep going that looks
great on you right and he looks pretty
bad
oh I think it could potentially get up
in the smellin a little bit yes I'm
saying right now cons for me the price I
think there's a little ridiculous the
amount of product you get kind of
laughable do you feel like we did 10
uses yes and your bucks I'm just going
to start to and maybe they should
include like two of these so you're
getting like double
that would be a genius idea - yeah third
Kahn is there for shades which that's
laughable on a stage
this shit is called natural that I'm
using here and it's a little bit like me
and it's second from the darkest shade
you're running very light with their
shades and they're not giving options so
that's frightening agree now the formula
wasn't bad I guess I was a little show
how nice it's settling in is sticky
which kind of bothered me but overall
it's like pretty you end up with a
pretty look on your skin and that's what
we want kind of I mean I'm not hating
here you know I kind of like it thank
you thank you
here's the thing I love the formula yes
I don't know if we can improve it based
on all the cons well I was saying we
were real real fill that up in here okay
I'm not gonna approve it but at home you
know we've given you the dilemma so
we've given you the good you can kind of
decide and we're all different for so
like if you think it's worth it I think
we put a fair amount of information out
there yes we sure have make sure hey
well I'm curious to see how this laughs
we're about to go eat some Domino's girl
yes hahaha
and then we're gonna see I guess held us
where's yeah in order to come back in
like an hour and see how it wears let's
do what happens right we'll be back we
went downstairs and I said Nate how do
we love and he said velvety yeah what is
the full word so I'm gonna be really
honest Laura I don't mind the foundation
any either only thing I will notice fine
lines and like smile lines was that bad
a mess my lines but I could start
especially without the power I could
start to see it seeping into the small
eyes yeah it's a little crazy not too
bad though but still $38 it's hardly any
product and kind of a hit in a miss take
from it what you want yes try it out if
you want to it probably won't be my
everyday foundation I'll put it that way
if you're into hidden foundation and
this is for you
I think it's cool I love seeing what
brands are coming out with I think that
there's so many things popping up so
many new inventions yes it's cool to see
the beauty world transform yes it's cool
to see all these innovative products and
we get a trailer that's cool all right
