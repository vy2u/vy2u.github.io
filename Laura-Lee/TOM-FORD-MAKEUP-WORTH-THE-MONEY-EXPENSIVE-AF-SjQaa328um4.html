video is going to be me testing out the
expensive AF Tom chord makeup whoa I was
buying it all to do as video kind of
doing like a first impressions and
reviewing the products and I looked at
my total and I was shook so let me show
this information out there really quick
recently I did a video testing out all
elf makeup doing a full elf makeup
tutorial and people were so
disrespectful towards me because I
didn't like some of the affordable
products I don't know why people hate
whenever I just in the formal product
but it's the same thing if I say I like
an expensive product I get this why I
don't know this is the end of the video
their primary film the video there are a
couple Tom Ford products that end up
liking so that disturbs you this may not
be the video for you I'm just a very
honest youtuber I tell it like it is I'm
not going to use it my opinion to make
the audience like me better if I don't
like a product then I don't like it and
I will not lie about it you know I don't
think that's fair it's not me I'm just
going to be honest about how I feel
about products whether it's a dollar or
eighty five dollars if I like it and I
like it if I don't like it then I don't
like it you know and also we're all
different so something that doesn't work
for me may work fabulously for you and
that's what makes us all so special
because we're all so different so you
really have to like judge what you
prefer to product versus what maybe I
prefer a product I like to explain like
the texture of the product Howell Aires
is a good for Olli too good for dry skin
that way you can come in judges it is
good for you because we all have
different skin and we all want different
things in our makeup I'm just here to
talk makeup getting in connection with
you guys and and spread some honest
information I don't like to start my
intros like that I'm just going to keep
it 100 with you you know don't forget to
subscribe to my channel before you leave
I post three videos a week and I don't
want you to me fight so what would you
do if you miss out on my free videos
away alright guys starting off I went
ahead and pry my skin with a little bit
of this drink of h2o by Tarte this is a
good gel moisturizer just to prep the
skin and now I'm going to go in with the
Brogdon primer
which I've been using and I like it a
lot it has this little pop up top really
cute there Slava what a special looking
I like it I mean I may not like it well
I probably will like it as much in the
summer time I still have used a lot of
it and haven't had it that long look
with a little Dew teetered on my hand
and then I like to swish it in and just
rub it in my skin I definitely don't
like this product like helps hide pores
I just feel like it adds a little bit of
color to the skin and gives me like a
little bit of life it looks red right
now so been rubbing but one type of
foundation on top I really been enjoying
it alright next I have their timeless
perfecting foundation it has SPF 15 it
and I've never tried it before I start
this Tim top anyways i've swatched it
before on my hand cuz right when I got
it I was excited that little was baby
five dollars eighty five dollars that is
just girl I was shook so I just got it
all over my face I'm going to blend it
out with my Beauty Blender I kind of
wish o to use my our teeth brush but
feel like I don't know the beauty Wonder
just doesn't provide a full coverage I
still ever isolated Beauty Blender it's
a great everyday applicator and great
for concealer I think it's kind of
drinking up a lot of product - this is
wet it looks really pretty I skin but
it's not performing a miracle I'm saying
it does look pretty and I will wear it
after this tutorial because that looks
nice definitely liking it I'm just
saying it's just such a simple
foundation for $85 so there is some
coverage there and it blended out nicely
and somehow a miracle occurred and I got
my right shade online but how I did that
is because the shades are so off on the
website it's unreal I think I got a have
Bloomingdale's online and the shades are
like so often with actual with the
picture of the shades this is natural
outside so what I did is I googled Tom
Ford perfecting timeless foundation
shade
actual and install people's watching it
so you don't really see the shade and I
always do that with buying a foundation
online so I hope that tip helps you guys
I'm going to go in with the our teeth
brush elite oval 7 we're gonna do this
handsome my face is the same application
it was the same so this is like a sheer
to medium coverage foundations you can
still see all my fresh laying in my skin
is it really pretty and am i liking it
yes do I think it's it worth $85 it's
hard for me to say anything's worth
eighty five dollars in cosmetics because
that's just outrageous it is what pretty
oh my pin so we'll move on from there so
to keep the video interesting we'll go
ahead and do eyes because I don't have a
tongue for concealer I'm using this
little Tom Ford set just to see isola
eye and cheek palette the packaging on
this product is beautiful inside is
really pretty as well I don't like that
all the shades are shimmering I like a
matte that's just me this was also
expensive and I have to start with the
transition shade so because there is no
transition shape so I'm just going in
with a little bit of my facial pepper
watching the first one it's more of like
a foiled eyeshadow I feel it so it's
interesting it's not like a creamy
buttery one ooh with the one right
beside it is very creamy and buttery I
don't know if you can tell the
difference
not those pigmented eyeshadows in the
world just like just random shades you
know I think I'm gonna go in with this
guy right here these are pretty but
they're like flaky and like not showing
up as anything and to be honest with you
that's expensive eye shadow what the
hell I just I'm going into the deeper
shade now the hook and hopes are getting
more color
this is joke are you guys seeing this
no pigmentation oh my god I'm gagging
with a makeup brush it's just like
nothing that is not okay I'm a little
shook right now is a huge bust I don't
know if they have to be applied with a
finger but I just feel like if you pay
that much money like come on
as though Oh Tommy for so I'm still
trying to build it up over here on this
Idol I work some magic out this is the
deepest color and it's like annoying me
a little bit so I did buy this little
expensive little this is a $60 I
cream and eye shadow so we'll go ahead
and swatch the eyeshadow on top till
very it's the exact same as eyeshadow in
here cool
so maybe supposed to be like a foiled
Sparkle I'm not mad at that but you know
whenever the darkest shades are like
deep and creamy when you swatch I went
on a brush is like powder not cool but I
can't imagine this cream in the bottom
not being pigmented now come on baby oh
it's very rich and creamy which I'm
loving back so I'm going to go ahead and
work it on my eye I put it on the back
of my hand oh that's freaking beautiful
so maybe like the nice little
soft-boiled product is supposed to go
right on top which could be a beautiful
view oh I hope someone does makeup but
girl a little bit of this goes a long
way because it is very pigmented no
doubt I just got it right there great
mind you everything comes in these silky
little bags I don't know if that's the
selling point but I was just going to
throw it out there now I'm going to go
into the lid with my finger to really
get some pigmentation to come off and
I'm just going to do but you know what
that cream base dries really quickly and
this is a pretty pairing the eyeshadow
by itself might be a little
disappointing but like these two
together they pair pretty they are a
pretty easy product to apply like my
eyes look so basic though I mean for
like all the money spend like did not
pop in because I feel like I'm having a
basic I show today I'm gonna add some
winged liner just to like jig it up I
applied a wing just to jazz it up
because I mean what are you guys think
in the comment section does it look like
I have like a $65 eye shadow on my eye
to me it looks just like a kind of very
simple eye shuttling nothing spectacular
I'm gonna add just a little bit of my
mac prolongwear concealer because I
don't have a Tom Ford concealer on Det
they may come for concealer - so does
anyone know I went ahead and swatch the
blush in highlight out of this palette
and I do feel really really nice and
creamy so I'm not going to be using them
today because I bought this vague memory
jammer and this was like a hundred bucks
it's a pretty popular item I know a lot
of people have seen but it looks really
nice and I want to test it out for my
face makeup today it's a highlight brush
blush and bronzer I'm going to use the
highlight and blush out of it and then I
have another product it is a bronzer so
we can test out you know the different
comfort item this is their bronzing
powder separate and I want to try this
out as well so that way we kind of get a
taste of each thing out of each palette
the first I'm going to be using the
bronzing powder right here it's very
pretty it has a little bit of shimmer in
it swatches nicely have good
pigmentation and it's picking up on the
brush nicely yeah it might be a great
product let's find out that's going on
nicely that is really pretty so I'm
liking this single bronzer right here I
don't think it's too compacted or you
know chalky or whatever it's really
pretty it looks nice it's very warm foam
but I know they had different shades in
it so you don't have to get this shade
by the way you're like what shade I got
Laura this is gold dust oh one I think
it's called that because it has like
little flickers of gold in it but you
can't really see down the skin that's
really pretty so I'm going to grab a
morphe 570 brush and I'm going to dip it
into it via blush whoa that's pigmented
so got to start the panic all right here
I go are you watching that is pretty and
it's very pigmented why are the
eyeshadows not this pigmented oh
goodness
they got their face powders down though
yes okay so I went ahead and added my
lashes to ginge it up a bit a bitch full
thick and now we're going to tap into
the highlight that's pigmented let's do
a swatch eat and look sounds like a very
iridescent glow to it it's somewhat
natural grabbing my morphe y 14 bra
oh it comes off easy
oh that's pretty that's really pretty
like it's a nice globe not mad about the
highlighter you know that is really
pretty
so everything this talent was nice I
mean I didn't get to test out the
bronzer but blushing I'm really pretty
that's certainly not least I bought a
Tom Ford lipstick and it was $36 and I
saw it was $36 for the big one and then
it was 36 fitted well thank you however
it's like one of my favorite colors in
the world it's called Evan number 27 and
it is the Zac same color do you guys
like how I say Zac same color instead of
an exact same color it's exact same
color as stripped down by max but in a
lipstick tube in my opinion I mean it's
so pretty
and creamy it's unreal I love love love
love the lipstick who has got a high
dollar price on it though okay so this
is the final look I really like the
overall makeup look the winged liner
definitely just up the I show I would
never buy a Tom Ford eyeshadow again
just my personal preference I would buy
their face powders all day long they're
very expensive it's come forward we know
that I like their foundation and their
primer I don't know if I'll revise those
is because have so many foundations that
do the same thing that's how I feel
about the product some products are hips
some parts are misses that's normally
how it goes thank you guys for being
here and watching be sure and subscribe
to my channel before you leave I love
you guys so much and happy Himalayan
