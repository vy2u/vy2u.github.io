Laura lady and you're on my channel
today's video is going to be talking
about life-changing products that you
need in your life and then I'm literally
obsessed with no they these are not just
favorites you know for the month these
are really just products favorites
through in and throughout life that I
adore and and I think anyone would love
them and could definitely use all mostly
I thought I would give them a shout out
you know I want to put a drop in grab
some popcorn in a yummy drink let's get
my Nana you started okay so the first
product that is life-changing is this
stuff right here and I don't think it's
leaking but I felt something wet Wiccan
touched it so this is a cinema secret I
get this enemies as sold as before now
buy think and don't quote me on this but
I think it's cheaper and Namie's this is
a brush cleaner and it's pretty much
like a dip your brush in or really
shouldn't dip your brush in here cuz it
makes it unsanitary but I do because I
only use this for personal use not for
like my brushes I use on clients Oh
dirtiest brush it's super coated in
product and then I just take the brush
and go through and it dries instantly so
your brush is ready to go there's a
brush we keep squeaky clean so that's
what this part does it cleans your
brushes pretty much instantly and
they're dry sanitary and they're ready
to roll it is a life-changing product I
use it day in and day out
I do recommend grow your both so
freaking I do recommend giving your
brushes a little scrubby so scrub with
some soap and water every now and again
but I do use this on a day-to-day basis
is life-changing
especially you know if you do your
makeup a lot or if you're doing clients
makeup girl is what you need and your
life well next product is I don't know
how to pronounce this brand correctly
and I don't want to butcher it so that's
the brand you can find it at Sephora
that's where I found it and this is the
bum cream it is a tightening moisturizer
that is not too thick and goopy or
sticky on your skin but not too light
when you don't feel moisturize to stop
perving in between moisturizer and also
in tightened
little bully skin the smell of it is
that of heavenly heaven I have it and I
have the body spray of it this is my
full jar that I just opened now I've
already gone through one of these and
then I fell in love with it they have
the oxy berry one but this one that
leads to that one in my opinion is from
the best and I don't just rub this on my
ass and I don't do rub this part over my
butt I fell all over my body and I loved
it
and then people always tell me I smell
so good whenever I have it on so just
line you know okay so that next product
that is life-changing is the NYC liquid
liner I've been using this for years and
years and years and they're quit doing
it in America I believe I don't know why
I'm pretty upset about it as is everyone
else you know it's a $2.00 liner and
it's amazing it's it's a product that
helped me learn to do good liner so I
just ordered some off Amazon but I'm
sure they're not going to be sold on
Amazon forever and they're not two
dollars on Amazon they're more expensive
which sucks but a little lot in the
darkness is the next eyeliner this is
the NYX matte liner and it is so good
now it really is it's a great liner and
the brush on it is very similar someone
on the NYC liner if you watch my next
favorite video this is the liner I was
talking about
and lately I've got three of these on
deck because you know you can never run
out but if you do buy something from NYX
I recommend throwing this in your car it
is the best and it dries completely
mapped I have the n1c one on today next
product is a newer product but I can't
stop talking about it please use it
every single day so it is the perfect
setting powder by coverfx it is a great
setting powder it is very similar to the
Laura Mercier powder and separate
doesn't have talc in it so that is also
a great thing about it it also has this
little pop top lid where you just pop it
up and it doesn't make as much of a mess
so I really like the container on it the
product is great for setting your makeup
I'm almost out of this one overall this
is a fabulous setting powder and I know
people forever have been talking and
talking talking
alarm RCA but this one is definitely
very similar and just marvelous the next
track Donna mention to you is the fake
awake this is the nude liner from Tarte
now what makes this liner successful to
me is that it stays in your waterline so
I applied this probably three hours ago
in my waterline do you see that right
there it's still my waterline so there's
a bazillion of great really pigmented
eyeliner for your waterline but it's
like which ones actually stay in your
waterline is the test of all time and
the Tarte Wednesday's I've been using
this product for a long time I've been
using this darn little thing geez it
wasn't in high school but I mean this
part has been out for a long time I'll
show you the old packaging of it who I
bought this one myself
and thus when testing used to look like
a mailing anted up to this really cute
sparkly type thing this isn't fresh one
but it's one of the few liners so it
stays near waterline and also it really
opens up your eyes if you look fresh
awake and how was it I love it I love it
the next product I'm excu is by MAC
Cosmetics by the way I'm coming out with
a lipstick with Mac and Casey did and
this month I get to show you guys the
color of the lipstick so I hope you're
excited for that totally take you on a
little rabbit trail but I'm really
excited
okay so Mac Paint Pot soft ochre
literally this deserves an award it
hasn't won one already I have
recommended this part of so many people
and every time do I never hear anyone
say I hate that product I mean it is
such a good product I've been proud of
my eyelids with this since the dawn of
the dinosaurs girlfriend it has kept my
lids primed a day in and day out for
years it also covers redness or darkness
it makes my eyeshadows not crease up or
gets like little in it and I also use it
to card out my eyebrows it is a do or
die I always have more than one on deck
there's another one you just can't have
enough
that's a do or die product for me that I
can't live without and everyone needs to
know if you know and they also have
the pain early which is a little bit of
a deeper color it depending on your skin
tone so they work they're saying in my
opinion doesn't matter what color you
buy it still performs the same next
product is my Invisalign
thank you shout out to my dentist my
take you're looking better than ever
we're almost done that was a joke but I
do love my Invisalign next part is right
pixie this is the h2o skin drink and
I've been using this for a long time
this is a dupe or product that drunk
elephant makes and it is like a clear I
squared outta time but it's like a clear
gel moisturizer but it's super super
lightweight and this is great summer
although my early girls this is great
for my oily girls out here because it
literally rubs into your skin it rubs
into like almost nothing but yeah your
skin still feels so hydrated but without
that heavy greasy film moisturizer and
it doesn't make your pores like so in
full it's just a great moisturizer
especially the only skin it's super
super lightweight and won't later in the
day you won't regret using it and feel
all greasy and heavy okay next product
by milk cosmetics I use this product
every single morning I love it so much
this is the cooling water and mine is
like shrinking in the tube I don't know
why you see a lot sadder than that I
guess about open it every morning it's
getting air in it but I use this and I
rub it on my under eye areas I get
really really puffy face in the morning
I don't know what I did to deserve that
probably Karma for something I've done
but and this may feel first it's very
cold and it just feels so good on my
face I use it not only in the morning
just right before I start my makeup to
to kind of simmer down the situation but
it's a really great product to help the
puffiness and that's what it's for and I
believe it works and I've been using it
consistently for a long time I don't
make it I think it's like an instant
working to I don't think it cures
puffiness I think it helps to cool down
and calm the puffiness next time I
recommend to you is another set I'm like
this little area of baby here where
you're just going wild honey pieces
settle down my hair is crazy lately
I just haven't really my hairs I get a
weirdly
right now and I'm feeling some type of
way about it so let me wear it up for a
little bit longer and then I'll get over
it and start wearing it down again okay
okay
another really amazing product on the
market and not only that it's just so
affordable is the statement by Rimmel
this is a press setting powder and if
your face gets real greasy throughout
the day I remember men keeping a little
brush or sponge which hordes bacteria
that still keep it this and that in your
purse and just dab in and touch those
areas up with this and it really helps
you stay matte I like to set my makeup
with this I've gone through several of
these it's just such a fabulous product
and for fabulous price I'm in creamy
beige in case you're wanting my shade
but I recommend using this versus a
foundation powder packing on because
that's a lot of makeup foundation powers
are way heavier than just setting powder
so it kind of helps the situation
immediately then in long run if you or
you know blotting with a foundation
powder you might end up with a cakey
mess on your face and versus using
something like this now I do love my
cover effects setting powder I bake with
this especially that's what I mostly use
it for but I also set my makeup with it
like my whole face with it sometimes I
mostly use it for baking this I miss
these for just setting my whole face and
it's hard to carry this in your person
like whip it out real quick and like do
that little sugar just because it's a
loose powder and a little more messy
this is just simply amazing amazing
product bravo Bravo
such a strange person ok last but not
least I've - setting sprays and I want
to mention both of them systems on
business oh hey anyways I'm sure you
guys have heard of both of these when
I'm still not mentioning to youth so if
you're an only girl you might not like
this one but if you like like to do a
the definite dewy wet shimmery look
you'll love this and I do love it this
is a cocktail luminous dewy skin mist it
is a fabulous product to spritz on your
face after you're finished with your
makeup and it like the mac fix+ one it
picks up all of the shimmers on your
face and it just like enhances that
you're just like a glowing goddess and
is what I find that that is so good for
now the mac fix+ one it's also good for
that I got a little little I mentioned
that to you guys like a bazillion times
but it also I can spritz my makeup purse
with it and dampen my eyeshadows and it
enhances that pigment so much with this
product and neither these products are
good for making your makeup last longer
just letting me know if you want to do
something like that
the d split by our mechanic asked
several of them that will make your
makeup last longer but these are more
for enhancing makeup you can even prime
a little bit with this because it's got
minerals in it like making sure I'm not
just making up but I'm 90% sure the
stuff like mineral in it so you can just
spritz prep your skin with it I
recommend it to you they are amazing oh
we close the Valiant
what if I double join it arm so yeah
that's it for this video guys thank you

leave and talk about more products and I
lurve and I'll see you all in my next
video bye Samantha's line back in so the
