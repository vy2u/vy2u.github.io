video is going to be my Holy Grail
products that like I
abso-freaking-lutely cannot live without
these products I use day in day out I
count on them like I need them they're
for me
and so I wanted to do this video a
little bit different than a monthly
favorites video because I like never
talk about these products and it's like
but why not what's happening because I
just feel like it's a given and I don't
know it's not like new fun exciting
something I'm in loving just for the mom
so I don't incorporate in my monthly
favorites normally it's just like my
holy girls I don't know a better way to
explain I don't think it's a girl you
know good Archangel hey this is she
beautiful
what do you say also I'm so excited
about it too because my hair was like
all the way down my back it was so
friggin long and honestly it was just so
much to take care of and it was heavy
and I got to the point where I was
wearing it in a bun every single day
because I didn't have the time to deal
with it it's just been crazy lately so I
honestly want him to like cut my hair
like up to here at the hair place and
they were like no girl
they said that we could gradually hit it
that short if I want to keep going they
thought I would have regrets I might
would have had regrets I don't know but
here we are and I got it recolored and
all you sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave that way it can notify
you when I upload new videos I don't
want you to miss your like okay girl
jumping right in Leslie and so on the
first part I'm gonna mention is it's
like I don't know what to grab because I
love them all equally the first part of
an invention is the laura mercier
translucent powder this is the loose
translucent powder and this one is the
baby version I had the baby version
because I went to a photo shoot and like
eight people had the same powder and
then I ended up with none ëthe end that
sucked really bad for me I one went home
with two I already ordered another one
minions of forever and a day and let me
tell you how I use it and how much I
love it well of course I baked my face
with it you guys have seen me if you
watch any of my makeup tutorials ever
you've pretty much seen me break my face
with this and baking your face is really
nice for making a makeup last longer
first and foremost it also helps with
your concealer make it not decrease
smooth out the skin
you can even sharpen your contour if you
bake your bottom jawline is really
amazing for that it's not like that
stark white translucent powder like make
it forever make swear it's definitely
going to flash back on a camera this one
reminds me more of like a film loose
foundation powder this is the shade
ivory like that's how this one reminds
me so therefore is not going to flash
back on you um
I love this shiz like I would eat it for
breakfast huh I don't know why I just
would because that's how much I love
working so weird we're always getting
weird in here okay Olli are weird or
greasy during the day like right through
here I will literally my little sponge
get some on my sponge and just like I
get greasy right here too because I talk
a lot dab it and it literally just
softens the skin and absorbs all of that
oil it's just like a miracle product and
this is like an absolute for me well I
had the next product in my hand I was
gonna mention to you guys the Beauty
Blender and this is the original Beauty
Blender and whenever these first came
out I kind of refused to buy one because
I was not gonna pay twenty dollars for a
freaking sponge I was like it's a sponge
people but then I realized like
everybody else is the best sponge in the
world and make these so soft and dampen
em and of course we all know the magic
that they can create just blending out
the makeup flawlessly especially during
the winter time when the air is a little
bit more dry we have our heaters on they
actually retain a little bit of moisture
into your skin by pushing a night damn
you beauty blender to blend out your
makeup so in the summertime I don't use
them as much I tend to use my makeup
brushes to blend out my foundation but
in the wintertime I'm all about it - it
adds a little bit of moisture lens out
seamlessly but I use it you know with my
translucent powder and all that jazz
during the summertime I will tell you if
you store them or tuck them away in your
beauty jewelry or Alix 90 or whatever
you're packing while it's damp
especially if you live in humid stage
such as I'll bounce a on my floor
Alabama Georgia you know
I can mold if you see little black dots
appearing on yours that baby girl light
it on fire cuz it's got mold on it
honestly like I would I would almost
like to set mine in the sunlight to dry
if I lived in a humid stakes the air so
wet it just can get mold really easy
even if you live in a dry state you know
can still get mold and we don't want to
be pushing mold into our skin next
product have to mention to you is the
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I have been
using this thing since high school I was
actually using paint only in high school
but I've been using Mac Paint Pots since
high school because I find that they're
the best
I showed a primer on the market it's a
little bit different of an eyeshadow
primer than like the Too Faced or the
urban decay the liquidy ones this one is
more like almost like a texture of a
concealer and also I like that it is a
thick texture because it covers any
veining or redness on the eyelids all of
our eyelids aren't just perfect so you
know they need a little help
I love how if I swatch anything with my
middle finger all my comments are she's
flicking us off come on now if I was
gonna flick someone off I would do it I
would just do it I wouldn't try to be
sneaky about it I'll just hold my hand
like this it has nice coverage and I
find that I never have an issue I really
truly never have an issue with my
eyeshadow running or bleeding or
smearing and I owe that to my Mac Paint
Pot and so it's like since it's such a
good product why change it you know you
never have any problems out of it now
also use this to carve out my eyebrows
especially whenever they get a little
cray-cray in the bad way you know you
need to sharpen and clean that area I'll
take a flat synthetic brush and just
clean up my eyebrow honestly like if
they took it off the market I am NOT a
percent sure what I would do like what I
just like quit YouTube I'm just kidding
the next product I when I mentioned to
you guys is this March Jacobs little eye
liner and this is a sample one because
tragedy struck at my household as drop
that I'm just like gonna keep talking I
went out of town and left the lid on my
Marc Jacobs eyeliner my big one that I
paid a lot of money for and just let it
setting there on my desk like this and
let it dry out
I watched my money go down the toilet
whenever I got home and discovered it
was laying there and it had died I was
like okay well let me just shoot myself
in the butt anyways this one is like a
simple one I got in like the birthday
present at Sephora and this is the best
eyeliner for your waterline because it
will not budge I don't care how long
you've been wearing it I probably wear
this you see my waterline still black am
i I mean it just doesn't budge I mean
and you that's really hard to find this
is dang sure worth your money because
seriously I put it my waterline every
day and I have had this for months
it is a Holy Grail product is something
I keep on my desk and reach for it every
single day next product is the duo lash
glue this one is in dark tones so it's
the black lash glue by duo this is a
drugstore brand you can give it like a
target the drugstore side of Ulta it is
so freakin good and let me tell you
something yes my lashes have come loose
with this before and I am okay with that
because I've used the House of lashes
one that a lot of people swear by and
the issue I had with that is well my
eyelashes will never come loose but the
it would rip out my lashes and I
couldn't get the goop off of my eyes no
matter how much make it remember I used
I ended up setting there a magnifying
mirror every day before doing makeup
picking lash glue out of my lashes I was
losing lashes like wildfire it was crazy
so I was like not worth it absolutely
not so I went back to this and I just
have no problem like it's there's never
any gooped up in my lashes now have you
ever been like out wearing false lashes
and the little inner corner of your
lashes like flickers up a little bit
mm-hmm and you're talking to your
girlfriends and they will look you into
your soul and not tell you that your
lashes come loose that's not your friend
so I was actually at a Maybelline event
and Kristen dominate walks up to me
she's like you're your inner corners a
little lifted I was like oh really I was
like let me see close your eye I was
like baby you can't tell it all it looks
amazing I promise you don't need to fix
it and she was like not my inner corner
your inner corner has come
it was like she had her lash glue with
her it was all good but anyways funny
story you know just all would add that
in but yeah still lash glue come through
it
oh so affordable and so good moving I'm
making this video as long as I possibly
can I don't know why moving on mac fix+
spray look at this empty bottle I have
bought more mac fix+ spray than I have
probably bought tampons
okay that's like too much information
but this product is so amazing of course
we're setting your makeup it enhances
the shimmer eNOS of your makeup I mean
I'm a highlight on today so I would
spritz it like on the sides of my face
and enhance my highlight if I've had my
concealer on for a little bit like the
concealer before I blended it out I will
spritz my Beauty Blender with it and it
helps to blend out the concealer your
shimmery eye shades you can spritz the
breasts with a little bit of mac fix+
right before or after you put it that I
showed it on your brush and pack it onto
the lid and it will enhance the color of
your eyeshadow so much so this is just
like an all one absolutely amazing
product and people ask me all the time
like what do you know anything that's
similar and I don't know anything that's
even a little bit similar to this and I
am like Duke Queen like if I have a dupe
I'm going to find it and let you know
about it but this uh this is also a
little bit different than like the all
nighter chill setting spray by Urban
Decay because that's like a lock in your
makeup setting spray this is more like
an enhance your makeup setting spray
okay moving on this one is kind of
random but you need to know about this
is the tweezerman ultra precise tips so
I paid $30 for this little guy at
Sephora and I literally like saw it in
support I was like dang I need some good
ass tweezers and so the brow hairs are
playing me it was $30 and I literally
like circled the area like a shark like
should I do it that's really stupid to
pay that much but should I do it and I
just did it and I've never looked back
like it was just like the greatest day
I use them every day either to pluck a
stray hair or to apply a lash or
anything I mean just anything you want
to do with the tweezer honestly they're
worth of money and that's kind of crazy
like saying $30 for tweezers but these
are worth the money next part I want to
mention you to you guys it's the
blending brush this is the
five by Sigma beauty and like I said if
you ever watch one of my makeup
tutorials using this brush featured I
can't do my makeup without this brush I
might as well be doing my makeup with my
finger this brush I can just about
complete an entire tutorial with it if
you buy brush set from Sigma for eyes I
wouldn't buy it without the e25 included
or if you're wanting new makeup brushes
and you don't know where to start well
start with the e25 from sigma it is a
flat blending brush I like to normally
put color on one end of it and then
flick it up and just blend out that
crease just like that have medium-sized
eyelids they're not tiny but they're not
huge so it's a good medium blending
brush and I like how it's flat so if you
can see how it's like flat instead of a
rounded blending brush because I feel
like it lays flat and you can soften up
and blend the crease out better I'm
stepping on a bag of chips that's
embarrassing
why is there chips down there next
product is a lip product comes you way
this is I have three of these and I know
I have three weeks if I lose one I'll
lose my mind I have one of this desk one
of my purse and one by my nightstand
I've always had very dry lips and it's
because I don't drink enough water I
could just drink more water and not use
this but you know anyway that's off
subject I love this stuff this is the
essential lip enhancer it also has stuff
to plump your lips but I am actually
allergic to chapstick so like chapstick
and karmic smell that doesn't really
work for me because it makes me have a
rash all around my mouth like crazy it
was a really awkward time for me in high
school when I didn't know how I was the
large let me just put him that way
but this I'm not allergic to and they
cleat proven to increase the fullness of
your lips so yeah if you just keep using
it and I use it day in day out even if I
have a look liquid lipstick on and I'm
out my lips are just too freakin dry I
will take a dot of this on my finger and
just apply it and my liquid lipstick
will look a little glossy I just like
helps my lip so much all right so we're
almost finished so let me keep rambling
a little bit more so I have my all-time
holy grail lip product and it's three
products and I never really wear them
alone but I wear them all together if
I'm not wearing a bold lip this is what
I have on my lips right I have them on
right
now I keep them in my purse actually
went to get them out my purse to put
them on for the video and they're going
straight back to my purse
the first is stan sandstorm this is next
liquid lipstick and it is a deeper brown
color and i like to apply it all over my
lips first and then i will take i'm nude
by geoffrey star and just apply it in
the middle in the gum and then i'll take
my ring finger and Pat it out that way
the edges aren't rough and it kind of
gives the illusion that your lips are a
little bit more plump and full because
they're like um braid out makes you look
like you got nice butthole lips and then
to top it off I just add a little bit of
hella bite are this one is there nude
lip gloss and it's so good it is not too
goopy I don't do goopy lip glosses this
is my Holy Grail lip combo that I came
out lastly as cliche as it may seem the
larlie x balance is a palette is the
most definitely a holy girl to me I've
been wearing this palette for two too
much straight literally not one other
eyeshadow has touched my eyelid if you
guys don't know this is the palette I
created with violet balls which launches
June 10th for pre-launch and June 23rd
for the whole launch of it I have it on
right now of course I am obsessed with
it I'm in love with it I've been seeing
people do videos with it it makes me so
excited and thank you guys if you've
done that and thank you guys for
tweeting me and all that and it's I'm so
excited about it my first tutorial with
it will launch this week probably this
Friday you will see my first tutorial
with it and it's going to be amazing I
am so proud of it I feel like me being
able to use this and this alone for like
two months straight literally proves
that you can create so many looks with
this palette not having to reach for
other colors because it has like all
your transitions and all your different
mattes and shimmers that you will need
to slay the day so how could I not
mention this like how it would just be
dirty and wrong and a lie I love this
thing it is everything just everything
so that is it for this video thank you

you guys
