video is going to be talking about
products that I cook Oh
in addition talking about products that
I currently cannot live without these
are some of the greatest most fabulous
products and I have been loving them and
using them non-stop I packed them
wherever I go oh and also in this video
I literally the request is coming out of
the wazoo for me to talk about some of
my favorite makeup brushes if you hang
out towards the end of the video I'll go
over to my must-have makeup brushes I
won't go over every single brush in the
world that I think you must have in your
life I just go over a couple that I just
think are the most fabulous brushes ever
okay like it's the necessities okay so
hang tight twist into the video and yeah
we'll go ahead and jump right in and get
started on this video be sure and
subscribe to my channel before we get Li
discuss today alright let's jump right
in and get started
Oh Kido sticks okey the first product I
have to talk to you guys about which you
probably have seen it on my Instagram
because I've been doing little Instagram
videos on this this is the alum come
Visionnaire crescendo now this is a
facial mask with part 1 and part 2 so
you get two sides to it this is my full
bottle of it by the way my bottle that
I'm using it's in my bathroom I have two
of these guys and I love them so much
and it's done so many cool things for my
skin
now I posted me using this on my ID and
it was really cool being able to read
the comments and seeing everybody else's
experience with this product a lot of
people told me how it changed her skin
completely and it's really great for
texture people told me it remove dark
spots off their skin and just revamp the
stamp their skin completely I saw my
skin to literally feel so soft and the
texture is just like I mean look even
with the highlight which picks up so
much texture oh we're getting in it's
just smooth the skin looks so good and
I'm really pleased with that outcome in
this so this is a leave on nightly peel
to put it on at night go to bed and you
do use phase 1 for the 2-week 14 days
for parashu for phase 2 which you then
put on at night
go to bed and you use it for forty
nights as well phase two is concentrated
with pure guy colic acid as well as
salicylic acid in its two I'm going to
recommend when using this product since
it is like a nightly pill and my skin
did not feel off by the way using this
it was super gentle but still I'm going
to recommend to you guys they're going
to be out in the sunshine or you know
anything extreme on your face be sure
and use your SPF people so you are
protecting your skin as you're going
through this nightly pill if you're
dealing with texture and even as I mean
this fixes a world of problems on the
skin so if you're dealing with that I
really recommend it to you and I'll have
everything including this link down in
my description box down below to check
it out as you go okay moving right along
another product that I have been living
and breathing for is this BH Studio
total coverage concealer they're super
affordable products and now BHS at Ulta
and oh my gosh this concealer is so good
it has this whip lightweight texture and
then it's super look that one dot are
you kidding me look at the coverage is
so much coverage but yet it's so
lightweight and I find it doesn't get
like heavy and creasing greasy on me
this is such a miracle fabulous
concealer I don't know if this is that
ultimate might just be on the BH website
I don't know it wasn't to the NPR but I
adored I highly recommended to you guys
and I love it everything girl it is
affordable ochre another product that I
just am madly in love with and I
discovered this on my trip almost in
Saint Tropez and just pressed it all
over my body as most of you guys who
follow me on snapchat already saw that
but this is the gel do you Jill coconut
gel highlighter I cannot get that out
this is a really interesting formula to
it because it feels kind of different
than anything I've ever felt
it is literally feels like lightweight
gel but the power that this highlight
packs I mean obviously you guys can see
and that was one tiny pump so a little
will take you a long way
super lightweight on the face but what
Jeffrey did and what really got me
hooked is polished my legs and my body
with it and in pictures girl
it's beautiful it seriously is so
beautiful but the thing that I like
about it too is that yeah it's a
blinding at the same time it is somewhat
subtle you can definitely build it up or
even add a powder on top of it and get
real cry-cry with it but it's just
honestly a beautiful highlight and I
just find myself I'm going anywhere I
just put it on my body all the time I
put out my arms you can even mix it in
with your moisturizer and roll with it
and of course you can use it all over
your face
another cool thing you can do with it is
you can mix it in your primer for your
face if you want a little bit of a
luminous glow all over so you can do a
number of things with it and I
definitely think you get your money's
worth out of it this is so such a
versatile product I have one more
highlight I have to mention to you guys
because I didn't live in it it is just
still a push and a lot of you guys felt
the video I did on these already and
honestly going into it I like this is so
crazy and gimmicky and they didn't even
swatch that well but then I went in with
my kabuki brush where's the brush so I
can show you okay this is not I cannot
find my brush this makes me so sad but
this is basically the brush I use this
is it more PM 335 brush and it takes a
dense brush to really get this product
going but once you do it had it me shift
to the core I'm going to put some on my
hand right here yeah so uh-huh you can
just like literally see that's insane
and every time I wear this time is going
to have to I'm sorry
mm-hmm every single time I wear this
product out people immediately go what's
on your face so crazy I'm like it's that
still putting a light barrel you already
know so I've been addicted to this one
transcendent and kitten is my favorite
one so many desires Twitter V to that
video has shown me like that you are now
using your product that you had already
bought differently and we're getting so
much more out of it I'm telling you the
dense kabuki mini kabuki brush is like
with the product and you were also
showing me you guys went out and
purchasing we're loving it so we're all
in the same boat such an amazing product
look at okay next up is a mascara so
there's a lot of drugs on mascara seven
loving recently I just just just tried
this one out this is the volume left
paradise
if from l'oréal I like it I like the
Big Shot from Maybelline and coverall
came out with total tees and I love the
total tease I literally just packed this
on my trip and use it the whole time it
really gets up in those lashes and it
like will stick them to the false lashes
too it has this like weird little
mustache hanging off the edge and I do
not use that at all I find that to be a
little odd but the actual formula of the
product itself in mascara is just great
okay next up I have an eyeshadow palette
that honestly I'm just going to throw it
out there this palette sits right here
on my table and I don't move it from my
table because I use it every day
and I normally just you know whether I
do a full look out of it or not I
incorporate this in my look every day
because it has so many amazing neutrals
think it might look started off and then
it also has the amazing like a cream
base color to soften up my primer and
then it has all the beautiful shimmer I
like cannot help but to dip in this and
then all my mocha brown this is my
favorite palette that morphe has ever
come out with this is the 25b palette I
just literally can't quit using it so I
thought I'd mention it to you guys in
this video and I love the clear top on
it I love the clear top so much more
than the cover top because you I don't
know if that's what's making me use it
so much being able to visually look down
and like seeing the colors and like oh
yeah that's what I want to use I don't
know but guys this palette is like my
bread and butter and the quality of the
eyeshadows are just phenomenal like no
joke oh it is so good and I swear it's
on my eyes in some way fashion or form
every single day so next is a lipstick
that I have just I keep it in my purse I
travel with it take it everywhere and I
only have one of them because I think it
was quite expensive this is a Charlotte
Tilbury
Kim K lipstick which I think this is
super on look it melted from being in my
purse so sad but this is a super popular
color and me and Manny were hours
shopping while we were shopping God
knows but we were out shopping around
and we both saw this and we're like oh
my god we hear so much about this and so
we both bought
and we both are madly in love with it
it's literally the perfect nude color
it's it's not exact but it's kind of
actually kind of close to my matka
lipstick that I created that's filled
out forever so this isn't necessarily a
dude but it's close maybe that's why I
love it so much I don't know but it's
honestly if you want to splurge a little
bit on yourself and treat yourself well
girl that lipstick is everything and
more next for a little bit more of an
affordable product that I adore actually
I'm on right now which is exciting this
is my friend Karen I love kuraki pretty
sure after all the time knowing her I'm
still saying her Instagram name wrong
but she collab with color pop and she
came out with a bunch of product so one
of my favorite products that she came
out with is this lip pencil and I'll put
the name of it on the screen because God
knows I don't know how to pronounce
anything but it is like my dream color
and now what I like to do with colors
like this is apply them to the outer
corner of the lips and I think what a
color pops besides our eye shadows the
strongest product or the limp pencils
they are just perfect the formula of the
lip pencils are spot-on and I have it
like on the outer part and that's just
what I love to do with this product and
it is like Zee color like my go-to color
and actually this and Kim K paired
together or like is it bad that I'm
talking about three highlighters in this
video probably so but I'm gonna do in it
you guys are going to be looking up with
a highlight
okay this wedding well Megas glow
highlighter I feel like I've talked
about at 900 times in my channel but I
wouldn't still be talking about it if I
didn't truly love it and I loved it the
whole night I have to talk about it this
is this is my favorite shade in it too
by the way this one is shade precious
petal probably the most affordable
blinding highlight you're going to find
it seriously if you can find these grab
them all and don't turn back it has the
quality of such a high-end highlight and
I just think it's so wild how how great
the product in the formula and how
beautiful and pigment it is for that
price it doesn't it is so really
lightweight this isn't like thick and
creamy
whatsoever but it feels light but still
it's just Power Packs that beautiful
high light and it isn't still really
dusty and powdery so I love this and I
definitely recommend it to you guys and
it's so ok let's just talk about a
couple brushes that I love so much and
then we will be done with this video
sorry it's getting a little bit long
we'll keep it moving look onto the same
brush the morphe y6 you guys already
knew I was going to talk about it I use
it pretty much in every single video
ever this is my favorite foundation
brush I love the size of it and I love
the fill of it is incredibly soft and
the guilded collection is one of the
more so affordable collections on more
fees website so that's also great about
it it's just like the perfect kabuki and
I find that it's a little bit dense and
packed in so it doesn't absorb a lot of
your product and your product stays
nicely on top and it's not eating up
your foundation which I have a had
problems with brushes in the past super
annoying but this y6 brush II is like
everybody needs is in their life
flawless foundation right here my
favorite highlight brush on the market
ever ever ever is the r36
from morphe I use this brush every day I
have about three of them in my drawer
and the brush bristles are like a little
bit raspy so I feel like they grab a lot
of the product up into the brush and so
you're really going to get that blinding
highlight with the r36 the rose gold
collection and the yota collection or my
two favorite collection from morphe site
if you were wondering and not only that
I feel like it has it's just small
enough so it's not exploding the
highlight everywhere it's putting it
very meticulously right where you want
it on your face you can even do the nose
and keep it go with this brush and that
is it I mean this is like the best
highlighting brush unless you're using
the putty highlights thing you need a
little bit of a kabuki but any powder
highlight just my baby girl and I'm
going to go ahead and mention the y11
brush to you guys this is also one my
favorites again part of the guilded
collection I love this brush you could
use it for multiple users but my two
favorite uses is to either blend out
cream concealer it just has that dome
shaped taper top to it so fits right in
that inner corner and I can
half out my concealer it's so soft but
yet it's quite dense and moves cream
product really nicely or you can get
really detailed and bake your face with
this brush and then get around the nose
down the sides of the face without its
floating the product everywhere because
of the size of the brush is genius it's
perfect
I recommend it in I love it okay and
then I have it just a couple of
eyeshadow brushes talked to you guys
about the r39 is my bread and butter if
you have medium sized eyelids I don't
really got a huge eyelid space medium
small eyelids this is your girl that you
need to blend out your eyeshadow it fits
right in there but the brush isn't so
big works exploding the shadow out
everywhere and you can keep it nice and
tight and low but yeah it gets in there
and it really softly it blends out the
shadow I adored this brush I use it
every single day and have multiple ones
on my little vanity and then another one
is the m42 one brush this guy right here
is the perfect medium-sized flat brush
you can add eyeshadow onto your eyelid
with that which I've used this today to
pack on that shimmery eyeshadow is great
for packing on and building up lots of
intense color or you can use it to carve
out your eyebrows because it has that
nice soft domed edge but yeah it goes
super flat so you can just really get in
there and carve them out you can buff
out the lower lash line with it this
brush is like so affordable and it's so
tiny and but it does everything for my
eyes so I have multiple of these of
course because I use it every single day
and you're like hey what about us girls
with a little bit more eyelid space or
the bigger eyelids the m57
3 brush is so genius for that I can put
this right what I use this for from me
is to apply the cream color all over my
eye just to soften up my eyeshadow
primer I use this brush every single day
for that I just grab it has my cream
color on it and I just buff it all over
my eyelid but if you have bigger eyelids
you can use it to do your crease you
know move that product around it works
so nicely for that and if you tomorrow
eyelids is so great like I said I kind
of have a medium eyelid and I can buff
the product all around with this brush
and it's genius and I love it and then
one more is the e36 this is a mini
pencil brush so it's a little bit
smaller than your average pencil brush
this brush is so great for detail work
if you're trying to get in that inner
corner right there and smoke it out it's
great for popping some highlight in the
inner corner and it's great for buffing
out that lower lash line so again a
number of uses in this brush it's just
like great this is a mini pencil brush
and I love it so much more than a
regular-sized pencil brush I just like
the makeup look comes out cleaner with a
tighter brush like this
okay so I've talked so much you guys I
need some water in a nap but these are
just products or is like yeah everyone
needs in their life I think they're so
great and I think I don't see how anyone
would ever be disappointed with these
chronic they are just like amazing I
don't have a foundation right now like a
new cool foundation or anything right
now that I'm just like oh you have to
have it your life or also what I
mentioned to it I have a lot of
foundations that I like but none that's
just like bread butter life or death so
I didn't mention it and yeah but I love
