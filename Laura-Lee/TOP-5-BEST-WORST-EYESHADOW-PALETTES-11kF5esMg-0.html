luck
jumping in today's video we're going to
talk about eyeshadow palette which I
don't like I ever do a dedicated video
to eyeshadow power but girl you know we
love some pallets lately there's been so
many great palettes launching and then
some that have just kind of hung with me
for the past year so then I just
gravitate towards and use all the time
and then there are some palettes that
came out that I literally see myself
never using so we're going to talk about
my sides best I said of Ellis and my bow
works Tasha palette swaps my little cat
Lou is wandering around the room and I
just wanted to please also before you
leave don't forget to subscribe to my
channel I post three videos a week and
you don't want to miss out let's get
started okay I have a palace let's do
this so top five I should have held it I
think I'm going to go back and forth I
did one a bad one a good one a bad one
that way we keep the video juicy you
know time so one day I've been loving
and this is a recent launch palette it's
by coloured raine and it is actually the
first product I've ever used from this
brand I don't know if it's a new burner
or not I don't know much about the brand
but I know they're I shoulda palette is
awesome awesome this is the Queen of
Hearts palette and I love how the inside
of it is all gold and then you get a
total of twelve colors
you get six maps and six shimmers I love
an eyeshadow palettes kind of keep it
even with us color schemes and purple
royalty colors and it to go with the
theme as well as some really great matte
transition shades this is one of those
palettes I can pack and honey use this
to do a complete look it is nice and
sturdy and heavy I love that about it
and it has a nice sleek black packaging
to Matt have a great texture to them and
they're definitely not chalky Oh another
similar solution wash okay
some palettes that didn't really work
out for me one is still the rock Los
Angeles palette every year they launched
the mega Pro and I'm always so freaking
excited about it and their past to have
been just amazing and then I got this
one and it's really pretty and you can't
deny that and it also has great quality
colors in it but I just look at it and
I'm like it doesn't make me want to
create anything nice and creative and
south winds whistle off Angeles Palin
that's where I live Mike is very generic
I feel like I have all of these shades
in a hundred different palettes I guess
like every palate has two shades I just
don't think it's a very creative power
and to have this many generic colors is
a little bit of a waste of money now
another one that I love so much it's the
hardest Pro palette this is probably one
not probably this is hard best eyeshadow
palette and I think this is one of the
their palettes that has like some of the
best quality shades I love this massive
mirror in it and then I love a duo
chrome shimmers in it and the matte some
of the best matte eyeshadows are right
here I mean girl if you are in Matt
lover this is your palette if you love
shimmers you know this might not be your
girl because it only has four but the
four shimmers are beautiful and I think
it's cool because I really think like
these go together
these go together these go together
these together to really help you to
create a little dipping it brushes all
the time Larkin helped me like pick
which colors to put together to create a
full look and this
how it really does that for you so I
totally get why they put the four
shimmers in it so it made sense I'm your
little lid color and then all your
blending out you know you brow ball in
your transition smoke it out a little
with this add some warmth the palate
just really helps you make your eye
shadow make sense and create a full look
this palette really makes me want to get
creative
okay that's how it didn't work out for
me I feel like I may have mentioned this
before this is the new dude palette by
the balm and this was my thumbnail of my
worth of 2016 but I didn't mention the
palette in the video because my mic went
out so conveniently it went out in that
video it was cutting in and out and it's
never happened to me and it never
happened again it was just having a bad
day I cut the part where I talked about
it this is so messed up with the mic is
like crackling but the palate was in my
thumb now and people were like you were
like oh girl you trying to quit beta
putting that in the thumbnail no Sally
didn't work out from me I felt like the
actual I like the color scheme as like
the actual pigments and the shadows were
very chalky dry blended out to almost
nothing like very dissatisfied it's been
shown love I just has been used a few
times and every time I'm just
disappointed
so I quit using it and I'm like you know
what I don't love this palette so next I
want to mention to you this Marc Jacobs
palette this one is a little pricey it's
100 bucks the quality and Marc Jacobs
eyeshadows are unreal they are freaking
the price point high but the quality is
just so good you know so I wasn't
disappointed and the palettes really big
it comes in this nice hard packaging
it's beautiful
you get a lot of color arrangement you
get a pop of you know some purple some
yellows to get a little creative but
then it also comes with great transition
shapes you can create a whole complete
look with it and it also comes with like
some nice neutral shimmers for Less
everyday look so I just love the
arrangement colors I love the quality
and I - I love the packaging it's just
like a little piece of butter
alright a palette that didn't really
work out for me so I'm going to mention
this planet by Urban Decay because I
mentioned in my
first of 2016 the moondust eyeshadows
and same goes for the palette actually
love the colors they picked in here but
I was trying to explain to people how to
use these because if you use them like
an eyeshadow they are pretty much the
worst they literally just crack all
across your eyelid that horrible fallout
the pigmentation is like all over the
place but if you use them as a glitter
girl they are everything these are so
pretty as a glitter but just like as an
eyeshadow lay even if you dig your
finger in it and Pat it it's a mess I've
had such bad luck with these but if you
put down some glitter glue and just use
it like you would use a glitter there
literally everything okay palette did I
love is my morphe at 35 s now I know you
thought I was going to say morphe 35o
and that is the favorite pile of my I
feel like I talked about it so much that
we can move on to the next best thing
and now this is a small palette actually
but I don't care I mean I love it so I'm
going to mention it personally like
these are my shades clearly look at my
eyelids like this is my Fang I like it
has so many great all of a bronzey
golden like honey golden and purpley
plum cranberries this television feels
like a fall leaf and then it has a lot
of shimmer so if you love that sparkle
or shimmer on your eyelid this is a
palette for you if you love like a full
matt I just might not be your favorite
palette because it only the bottom row
and the quality of this palette is
amazing such easy palette to create a
dozen and good looks with and it's a
portable because it's more feet just
like 20 19 22 alright a palette that
didn't work out for me was by Too Faced
this is their funfetti palette and I was
really excited about this palette and
then I opened it up and I was like man
these colors I feel like are so bland
and I feel like Tuesday to come up with
these color several times before and
they're just so pastel they don't have
the right colors to create a full look
with it I love it the color scheme or
what I try to create a look with it and
I was just like me especially I how to
keep dipping into other
I chose because I couldn't create a
whole look if I buy pallet has this mini
color I want to be able to create a full
look with the pallet I feel like I would
be nuts if I didn't mention this pallet
and I know I kind of be a dead horse
with it because I mention it all the
time because I love it so much but I
created the pallet so how can I love it
it is develop lost explore elite palette
comes with a total of 20 eyeshadow
shades half a matte kafir shimmer super
pigmented and a lot of them reviewable
1982 a chrome smash li shuo chrome
larlie is a dual chrome and so easy oshi
so you really get like a really fun
arrangement of color so this palette
really inspires me to add a little bit
of color to my life you know and not do
the same look every single day but also
if you are more comfortable with a more
natural look you have hissy fit pickled
peach sugar you know and then all your
nice little neutral grounds to create a
full look so my goal with a palette 20
color you know my options are endless
but I definitely wanted the palettes be
there to create a full look with it so I
put in the right Matt to really smoke it
out or blend it out warm it up and then
I really had a good time with the
shimmers because I really it was
important to me that the palette didn't
have colors in it that are in every
single palette I wanted to have fun with
it mix it up
throw in some duochrome some fun things
to inspire people to get a little
creative yeah my last palette did didn't
work out for me is the Paris palette by
a long calm they came out with a London
one that I actually loved a lot and it's
a similar palette but I feel like this
color scheme was so bland like I just
Max or a little bit dry for me because
color just doesn't make sense to me in
this palette I didn't understand it
honestly not an ugly palette actually
really nicely made pallid Russian it's
so soft but I played with some of the
eyeshadow colors I was just like this is
not a lolly kind of deal here I just see
myself never using this palette so I'm
like and so I have a six palette and I
love that's what I mention it although
it's like my top 5 and myself I'd worse
but our role to make for breaking a
crime there's like a shadow over there
and I keep feeling like someone's
lurking at me while I'm filming it's so
creepy I'm like keep looking over there
freaking out anyways it is the TV Travis
this is one of the best pilots in the
world packaging horrible smells adorable
and this is the one from the first round
of them so this looks a little older and
the smell is still fantastic now this is
where today's did it right they created
all the colors you need to create a full
look where you will have to dip into
another palette stay through neutral
shades in there for an everyday look and
then I put a pop of fun in there too
jazzed up and inspire creativity this
palette is absolutely home I think I
love the colors of it I have seen so
many looks on Instagram with it and all
the looks are completely different
you'll see like a blacked out smokey eye
really purpley eye a peach eye neutral
brown eye and they all case in the same
palette so I think that that says a lot
about the palette and that in it thank
you very much for being here watching I
love you guys so much I hope you have an
absolutely amazing day
and I'll see you all in the next video
