video is going to be my top back on the
path we're done I realize I have a lot
of products at absolutely adorned that I
feel like they just don't get enough
credit on my channel so I wanted to
create this video okay let me start that
over I feel like I have a lot of
products that are very affordable they
don't get enough credit on my channel
and I feel like they need to be talked
about a little bit more in the YouTube
world going to do that today in this
video umm yeah I'm really excited about
it because I hope I'm mentioning to you
a couple of products so you haven't
really seen or damn purred with yet
because as for me I haven't really seen
these products go wild on YouTube or
whatever why do I call it YouTube it's
YouTube hunty okay just a quick
announcement I will be at beautycon
Dallas this month and I will have a full
meet-and-greet and I know there was a
couple questions like if I buy just a
general mission to get can we still meet
absolutely I will fool meet-and-greet
and the we signage up and if you have G
a a general mission ticket you can come
to the main grade so I hope to meet you
guys I'm so excited I've never been a
beauty condyles before and the only time
I've ever really been to Dallas is like
through their airport I go to the Dallas
Airport all the time so I go to Dallas a
few times a year but it's only in the
airport so no explorations I won't be
able to do a meet-up outside a beautycon
just because I'm like their beauty conf
you back to LA and then I have like a
whole bunch of stuff right after that so
it's gonna be a crazy coming month for
me Wow but I'm so excited to visit you
guys and I hope to see you guys there
other than that we're gonna jump right
on in this video and we're going to talk
about some super formal products that
you may meet in your life let's do it
okay what I want to talk about first I'm
only have like no strategic plan as to
what I want to talk about but first
things first we'll talk about these now
these little eyeshadows are by wet and
wild and they are called for your face
and body only that is not what they're
called they're just like glitter
eyeshadows and the reason I love them so
much is because they came out glitter
injections is the brand and they came
out with a product that's like a glitter
eyeshadow but it's like gel anyways I've
been single on YouTube and I've been
seeing
want to Instagram a lot and I've tried
so hard to order some and they're always
sold out I can never even get one
there's cat hair on my nose so then a
while back I went to Walgreens awhile
back I want to say a few weeks ago went
to Walgreens or like CVS Walgreens is
where was that and I found these by Wet
n Wild and they look super freaking
similar so I picked them up and I've
been playing with them a little bit
which I want to do a tutorial with them
really bad let me know in the comments
if you want to see that but these are
the exact same thing and they cost $1 so
because I have clothes on I normally
like scrape a little glitter out so you
just pack it on your eyelid and they're
absolutely gorgeous so if you're a
glitter girl these are perfect for you I
think they're around a dollar and some
change I got the silver the gold and the
purple to have a whole bunch of colors
they're absolutely amazing x-pac time I
talked to you guys about is this scandal
eyes this is a waterproof liner which oh
my god I broke I talk about this little
gimpy pencil right here that I just
broke this is a waterproof liner and
it's nude and you might be like why do
you like a nude liner so much but I
really love it to put it in the
waterline because if you put it in the
waterline it can really open up and
enhance your eyes make them look nice
and round and big and just open it and
awake it can do so much for your eyes
sometimes I today I'm mostly I opt for a
black color but when I wear my nudes I
always get compliments on my eyes and
you just pop it into the water line when
popping in a liner in the waterline I
99% prefer mine to always be waterproof
because it actually stays as most of us
know whenever you pop a eyeliner in the
waterline you blink like three times in
a comb so the waterproof ones are bombed
this one's want to prove is drugstore is
super affordable and I love the nude
color versus just putting a white
eyeliner in your waterline just because
the white is so unnatural that is like
kind of pops almost too much just in my
preference maybe that's not the case for
everybody but I preferred a nude because
it just like enhances the skin color
love it some newer products for me that
I discovered that needs to be in
everybody's makeup collection I am
yes these are the Jordana cream
eyeshadows but the shades of them are
the prettiest most pigmented oh they are
everything
it's a nice cream eyeshadow which I know
scares people but if you dab a little
bit on the back of your hand and then
dab it with like your ring finger and
then it right onto the eyelid your eyes
will be popping so impressed with them
but let me tell you another cool use
form as well is if you know you swatch a
little on the back of your hand and just
with your fingers you could tap it onto
your upper cheekbone run it down the
nose pop it on the Cuba so a little bit
and get that nice frosty highlight that
everybody loves so much and it's such a
cheap product I believe I paid two
dollars each for these so my two
favorite ones are not a wink pink and
then forever sand amazing this one has a
little bit more of a rose gold and then
this one's more more of a champagne
color love I swear have a new fast food
Cup in a video every day I need to get
my life together oh yeah another product
I want to mention to you guys but I
don't want you to like stab me through
the computer screen say like six dollars
for it at Walgreens but we found that on
drugstore.com for like five dollars and
some change so you can get it in the $5
price range but it's so good I hope you
won't be mad at me for mention it in
this video
fizzy I mention on snapchat so much and
like I didn't swatch it with snapchat
you guys were like girl so watch it for
us I did swoon ups watching it but this
is the Rimmel this like the highlight
the contour in the blush by Kate
it's called this one's the shade is
called golden bronze 3 they have three
different like um like a white medium
dark I believe I got the darkest number
three Conroy Shea is pretty much gonna
be too dark for me but the reason I
bought it was for the highlight and
blush it was just like the prettiest
highlight and blush at ever seen and I
was just like taken back from it in the
store I was just like get in my life run
blush reminds me so much more orgasm by
NARS actually I have it on my cheeks
right now today and then the highlight
as well is such a pretty it's like it
reminds me a little bit of opal by Becca
cosmetics maybe a little bit lighter
than that
but gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
especially for the price so I definitely
thought it was worth and mentioned to
you guys i've swatched the contour but i
haven't tried on my face because i
pretty much know is too dark for me but
um so I'm not really sure I can't have a
say on like how well the contour powder
works but that leads us to our next
product Mac's product is by wet and wild
I've mentioned this in my in my on my
channel before you guys are literally
gonna murder me if this is not five
dollars but I'm pretty sure I pay like
right at five dollars for this I may
have been six dollars I'm ruining this
video home sorry to mention it to you
because this is the mega glow contouring
palette by wet and wild and I love it I
think it's one of the creamiest
drugstore contour palettes on the market
and I love the sides of it it's really
big me my sister both love it I got it
way back when I went to Alabama to visit
my family I'm and my sister swatch it
was like um I'm gonna go ahead and take
that and I was like gosh no you're not
looks like a size store that has nothing
to do with anything I've had a few
people say that its chalky but let me
just tell you like if you take your
brush and get a little bit of the
product on not too much and like press
it in do a little pressing pat pat pat
to set your concealer with this product
is not chalky at all but I can see like
if you start dusting it everywhere like
you might get a little bit of a chalky
fill so I'm trying to see where that
came from but my opinion I don't think
it shocked y'all think it's very creamy
just need to use it like in the right
manner and it really works well and same
thing with a contouring you can swipe it
around but it just depends on like how
flingy you are with your brush for this
product if that makes any sense
flingy is flinging a word because it is
today
next product I wanna mention to you guys
is it what's happening it's a product by
L'Oreal this is their color riche
eyeshadows now I have a lot of these and
I do love them but let me just tell you
my favorite ones are the shimmery ones I
think you get the most creamy color
payoff with the shimmery color versus
them at once I have a bazillion shades
of these so these three are my favorite
shades my all-time favorite favorite
it's number 207 though I can tell you
the number
and I love this color it reminds me a
little bit of pink champagne by
Anastasia Beverly Hills I've done a
bunch of tutorials using that color and
it's just a very gorgeous metallic color
the next one that I like a lot number
204 was on so this one's number 204 it's
a nice rich chocolate brown color that
has that shimmer in it they're not the
next one for a pop of color is green
pomade this one has the name on it
what's wrong with me
212 say nice emerald green color that
has like a very pretty shimmer to it I
almost wish I'd worn this today now that
I'm looking at it I'm like why aren't
you on my eyelid right now these are
$4.99 each whenever you get them at
Walgreens up our Walmart I believe last
time do I want to mention to you guys is
this pallet right chair by wet-and-wild
I bro swish was just literally fun
everywhere but that's okay cuz we don't
use this anyway this is a really pretty
palette I haven't used it like - crazy
much but I have played in it and I just
think the quality of the eyeshadows for
the price is such a good palette this
one is walking on eggshells what a funny
name to name an eyeshadow palette but um
I see these talked about all the time on
YouTube and is because eyeshadows so
very creamy let me hold up my little
three this is pretty much what they look
like there's pretty shimmery neutral
shades this palette reminds me so much
of springtime springtime so I thought I
would give it a mention to you guys it
has like a pretty soft pink a nice
shimmery brown and then a pretty brow
bone color which reminds me a little bit
of nylon by Mac it's just a very
shimmering light color which you have to
be careful with because you don't want
to get too much on your brush because
then your eye brow bone will be glowing
like a disco ball especially if you take
a picture with the flash and see this
palette is absolutely amazing for the
mood ah and that is fo but no I didn't
really have any lip products and let me
tell you why it's because I don't really
wear lipsticks much anymore I prefer a
liquid lipstick and at the drugstore
most of the cream to matte or matte
lipsticks around seven or eight dollars
so they didn't fall under the right
price range but I'm truly only going to
recommend to you products that I truly
use and that I really think that you
guys will like and if I just
haven't found a lip Prague that I'm
using a lot and that I think you guys
I'm not just going to mention it for the
heck of it so that is it for this video
I hope you guys enjoyed if you did enjoy
be sure to let me know if you didn't
enjoy be cool about it anyway
love you guys and I hope to see you in
my next video
hey my gone so just trying to explain
myself a little bit can see you went
well yeah we got a swatch all this stuff
oh I'll wait for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
