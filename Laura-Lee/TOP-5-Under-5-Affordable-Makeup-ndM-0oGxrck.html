video is going to be products that I who
have take a deep breath products that
I'm just in love with it costs five
dollars or less
mostly five dollars and I have one
product that cost more than five dollars
but our way to the very end to mention
it so I don't get in trouble by you guys
I'm really excited about this video
because I have like a lot of new stuff
to talk about that I love so much that
is so affordable not all necessarily
drugstore but it's good and you need to
know about it okay know in different
country things cost way different but
I'm an American so that's kind of what I
have to compare it by but um I hope you
still enjoy this video if you are from
another country and jump right in and
let's get started and by the way I'm not
gonna mention makeup brushes in this
video um I want to focus maybe a
drugstore makeup brush video I don't
know let me know down the comments what
do you want to see let's get started
first things first let's talk about some
lip products that I am just in dire love
with this these are the LA girl matte
flat finish pigment lip colors they
cause $5 each they are like in these fat
tube so you get a lot of product
my three favorite colors out of all of
them are lower Bazaar and rebel these
colors are gorgeous this one is my nudie
one this one is my pinky one and this
one is from UM people who like color
love these yes they're drawing I haven't
ran into a liquid lipsticks it isn't
drying I think they're a good quality
and I think they're well worth five
dollars especially if you're wanting to
try out a few liquid lipsticks on
yourself these are even cheaper than the
NYX suede lippies I recommend giving
them a try they're awesome blossom
moving right along
let's talk about lip liner so colourpop
lip liners are just of Mac quality
that's right I said it of mac cosmetics
quality they really are they have
awesome quality they're five dollars
each so they're just a little fraction
of the price I do have three favorite
colors grunge is just my holy grill it
is my all-time favorite out of all of
them I know that's a strong thing to say
but it's true here is being weird and
there's this gorgeous one that is like
this wine deep plum color and then
tempo is my favorite just neutral one
that I'll wear under a ton of things
with lip liners I don't necessarily
match them perfectly to the lip color
I'm going to be wearing because mostly I
fade it into or the lip color covers it
anyways I just like to always line my
lips that way it prevents lip colors
from bleeding whether it be a gloss and
liquid lipstick whatever it is I just
don't want it to bleed please stay in
place let's talk about some blushes I
got these jcat blush and my two
favorites are coral dumpling and honey
bunches what a cute name I didn't
realize this was called honey bunches
and honey bunches is the more neutral of
the tube look these are kind of strays
because they look like a matte blush or
like a shimmery cat but once you
actually get into them they're quite
shimmery and they're so freakin pretty
you see that
kissing that boom do you see that I know
you see it one is just a beautiful
beautiful neutral peachy color I really
love honey bunches so much they're
really creamy they're not dry or dusty
whatsoever so they're really nice
blushes probably so my favorites I
believe they cost around 399 that's
right a 399 so they're super affordable
and the quality of the blush is awesome
epic white a few of flavors is what I
was going to say but that's not right
quite a few colors but those two are my
favorites a continuing color pop have
came out with some new stuff that needs
to be addressed and are there new gel
liners they also have the pencil liners
but the gel liners have just overtaken
my makeup world I am wearing get my no
get paid right now get money get paid
right now on my eyelids so what that has
happened in the little brain of mine is
that actually the big brain immediately
when I saw them instead of thinking gel
liner because they have so many awesome
colors I just thought oh my gosh such a
cute beautiful such a gorgeous color to
be like on the lid of your eyeshadow to
use it as an eyeshadow and they just dry
so quick and just so hard they don't
like shift or move around to the other
places on your eyelid so if you have
hooded eyelids mine are like in-between
hooded and not hooded it's a real
awkward situation going on
it goes up whenever I'm squinting which
I'm always squinting some always
pondering hmm completely hooded but then
whenever I'm looking at you normal it's
not really hooded well the story is my
eyeshadow transfers to the top of my lid
and it drives me Cruiser but whenever I
use these gel liners as an eye shadow on
my lid they don't do that
I know it's genius but they're not meant
to be
um I shadow they're meant to be eyeliner
so they just work out really well for
that so my favorite colors are get paid
kicker which is silver showtime which is
copper dirty taug's probably up there is
my top favorite which is a gold color
you're fighting with hooded eyelids
don't fret because I think this is a
really cool way that's been working out
for me lately in doing your eyeshadow
with eyeliner but with the colour-pop
island I have it charted out with other
gel liners because I can just see that
being a disaster they should dried so
quickly and they stay dry so it's just
working out for me actually have a
highlight that's very affordable I
believe this is 399 and this is my
essence it's called so glow cream to
powder highlight and this one is bright
up your line I think they have a few
different shades I don't know I just
picked up this one because they look
beautiful one is like this pinky Miami
is a really bright highlight but it's
called creme de powder and I didn't even
realize that that was the name of it but
whenever I put it on my cheekbone area
I'm not wearing it today I should have I
know but whenever I put it on my
cheekbone area I was like oh my gosh
this cream had light blend down to a
powder and then I read it and I was like
oh well it's a really affordable nice
highlight and I know the whole strobing
highlight and get your glow on blind
people with your cheekbone is in right
now so this is an affordable option for
you check it out amazing if a concealer
that needs to talk about with you guys
and it is the match perfect concealer
from Rimmel this is an oldie but a
goodie for me I used to actually use
this on my Brides whenever I did Bridal
makeup and the code that I like for me
is 2:40 fair light neutral so it has
three names fair light neutral and
anyways it comes on a little brush like
a brush applicator tip now I'm going to
go ahead let you know that my favorite
drugstore concealer is the better skin
bye
that's like my all-time favorite but I
just love the application on this and it
is a good coverage concealer it's very
creamy which helps it not to crease so
much so if you're having a lot of issues
with the creasing under eyes I like the
better skin but a more even more
affordable option is the Rimmel another
concealer we need to talk about is the
incredible waterproof concealer actually
like the concealer for is not
highlighting or brightening up your face
is poor covering acnes it's so acnes is
i get this in the shade of like my skin
not a shade lighter so I get this in
beige which is C is 0 for cuz whenever I
have is it or something eyes whatever I
put on it to cover it seems to come off
really easy but this one is waterproof
so it helps to actually stay on at
keeping that little area covered or
whatever unwanted area you don't want it
is a stick concealer so it seems to be a
little bit thicker than the liquid
concealers which I like to especially
whenever I'm looking for coverage and it
has blend out nicely but it stays intact
so if you're looking to cover something
on your face not highlighting make sure
you get your concealer the color of your
skin not a shade brighter because and
that's gonna stand out obviously and
it's gonna be like a bright patch I even
say the name of it it's incredible
waterproof concealer by NYX I listen to
a bronzer essence Sun Club bronzer now I
have been using it and it is so creamy
honestly the feel of it gives me the
same thought as the j-cap blush it's
really nice and soft and creamy I mean
whenever you feel your site oh velvet it
smells like coconut so no one can be mad
at that right bat oh one natural which
honestly I could have went to the medium
one but when I went to get it they
didn't have the medium one no respect it
blends out so good and it is incredibly
affordable in its humongo so it will
last you a lifetime okay I mean on a
lifetime that was dramatic but it'll
last you for a long time the last thing
I'm going to mention to you guys and
it's into the videos and I'll be mad at
me for mention it but this is the city
color
fig tastic palette and it's $6.99 on
sale right now
well let you know that the colors are
not the quality of a Mac
I wore makeup geek eyeshadow they're
just there's not there or $6.99 getting
all of these colors I mean that's really
affordable really really impressed with
all the shimmery colors I think they're
magnificent I think that they show up
crazy good and they're pretty
long-lasting but the problem that I have
is with like these matte colors right
here they're chalking they don't blend
out or $6.99 is worth the shimmery
shades alone because they're so pretty
and that is so affordable you can't beat
it with a stick that is it for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed thanks for
