video is going to be a top 5 under 5
thoughts up and de fat I am really
excited for you guys to see this video
because I worked really hard and I put a
lot of thought into the products that I
wanted to incorporate in this video I
didn't just pick cheap products that are
okay I actually picked a lot of newer
products that I've been loving currently
that I haven't really talked about much
of my channel that are under $5 or
they're $5 and I'm really excited to
share them with you and I hope you're
really excited to see it also I'm
feeling a little weird today because I
have like new lips and we're all about
color on this channel so this is
throwing me off a little bit broke out
the new today and I don't know how do we
feel about it you know why I love some
cuz I'm not gonna blab in this video
we're just gonna jump right in and I'm
gonna talk about the top 5 under 5
really excited to share the first
products with you there by la girl and
this is a newer product for them and
it's actually a newer product for me as
well this is their matte flat finish
pigment gloss and I only have two of
them but I have a whole bunch of them on
the way I have worn both of them and I
love both of them very very much cool
thing about these are if you follow me
on snapchat I gave you guys a 40% off
discount code which made these three
dollars I will repeat myself
three dollars unfortunately the code is
over but they're only five dollars still
on the site I mean five dollars really
really really my favorite one out of the
two is this color was just just an
awesome color for um anyone this color
is what is your name oh this one is
dreamy I will just let you know that the
colors on this side are like a teeny
teeny tiny bit darker than what they
actually are in person because I whip
these two up on the site and they show
up just like a touch darker than the
actual gloss so just a heads up on that
but dreamy it's just a beautiful nude
pink color it has a lot of a mob kind of
mixed in it and then I also have playful
which it is playful it's like a Barbie
pink now this is a color I think I wore
this out to a beauty little shindig not
too long ago and I got a lot of
compliments on it because it's just one
of those bold colors or like a bright
pink color that's kind of like a
conversation starter
I like these they're not too drying they
actually are pretty tough to get off but
I do like that about them because I am
always worried that whenever I put on a
liquid lipstick that it's like coming
off in the center and I have like this
ring lipstick left oh oh they have a
whole bunch of colors to choose from so
yeah I still want to talk about some
blushes now these blushes are from City
color and you've seen me use this Sweet
Pea and a whole lot of tutorials because
it's just a blush color that it just
goes with most makeup look so ever I
look are lipstick your color you're
gonna wear that day I feel like this
blush is probably gonna match it it's
just a really good neutral color blush
again this is Sweet Pea the city colors
blushes are very soft they're very
creamy they aren't the longest lasting
blushes in the world
they're $5 man you can't beat it with a
stick the one I have is called dragon
fruit which is a really fun color it's a
super hot pink blush color now this
isn't something that I would wear on the
daily but it is a blush color that I do
like to have in my collection again it
has the exact same texture it's just
super soft super creamy another thing I
like about them they are pigment hits
but they're not too too too pigmented
I've said this before and whenever you
get into blushes you don't necessarily
want like this color on your cheek you
want a hint of this color on your cheek
so I like it when our blush has that
medium pigmentation not like too too
pigmented you know what I mean no next
actually I have a brush to share with
you guys and I freaking adore this brush
this brush is three dollars it is by elf
and it is the fan brush and I got the
brush in the actual brush kit which
costs ten bucks but you can buy it on
its own for three dollars I recommend
just getting the brush kit because hello
that's a lot of brushes I think it's $10
off the elf website if you watch my haul
you saw them yeah so that's the business
I'm looking for a good fan brush for a
long time because I wanted to use it to
apply my highlight use the Sigma f30 fry
brush which is my favorite brush in the
whole entire world to apply a powder on
top of my concealer to set it but I was
using it as well to apply my highlight
and I felt like it was dragging the
highlight a little bit too far down and
putting too much of a highlight on my
face and I like to just set my highlight
on the cheek upper cheekbone area down
the nose and the Cupid's bow and with
this brush I can just sit with such a
light hand just like fan the highlights
in the exact area that I wanted rather
than dusting it too far down and that's
why I think a fan brush is just so handy
if you're into highlighting it felt okay
and I actually have another product from
la girl and I try really hard not to be
a brand repeater but I am totally a
brand repeater in this video I'm sorry
it's their Pro concealers oh these
broken pillars are amazing it's pretty
much what la girl is famous for really
cool thing about the pro concealers will
tell me a really cool thing about them
is that if you follow a dress
your face tamanna she's like a famous
makeup artist and a whore on snapchat
she teaches all of her students all her
tricks of the trade with contouring and
highlighting with the pro concealers
people these are five dollars apiece
they are long-lasting they're really
thick in color like the coverage of them
is amazing they blend out well they last
long they don't crease and they're $5 so
that's cheaper than a drugstore
concealer just so you know they come in
like a bazillion different colors they
even have like a reddish one to cancel
out darkness a greenish one to cancel
out the redness they got the business
going on one thing I like to highlight
with is called natural and then the one
that I like to contour with is called a
beautiful bronze these are amazing for
the whole cream contour and highlight
shim dig they're also for amazing just
like if you need a concealer and the
thing that I love about them is you know
whenever your cream contouring and
highlighting you have to buy more than
one of them one for the highlight one
for the contour and they're only five
dollars so it's gonna cost you a total
of ten bucks they're so good that more
than five but I'm gonna keep going don't
be mad at me I'm more lippy so I want to
share with you so I'll go everyone quick
but these are the show off lip Velvets
by Rimmel London I am a color girl yes I
love color if you've been with my
channel for a while you know I love the
color
so my two favorite ones of these are
there number 307 and number 405 and
these are just amazing you buy these at
Ulta or drugstore they're a little over
five dollars you bought about Walmart
they're gonna be more than $5 range so
the just a heads up I'm trying to stay
in the $5 range
I mean look how far back and you I mean
you can see that clear as day like that
is some hardcore color payoff although I
just colored my whole entire hand with
it you're more like a matte lip gloss
rather than a matte or a matte liquid
lipstick he given I'm saying that was
five products but I have to have to have
to mention my NYC liquid liner I think
this $2.97 at Target this liquid liner
has been with me this is my og I learned
how to create winged liner with this
stuff it dries matte
all night long I've never had a problem
with it like smudging and I've won this
dub fo ever I have two tubes of it here
for whatever reason I guess one would
have sufficed but it's just an all
around good liner the brush on it is
super thin and pointy so it allows you
to get that flick in that wing it's how
again I learned to do winged liner with
my NYC liquid not our baby
yes but these are the business right
here they are the business so that is it
for this video I hope you guys enjoyed
like my top 20 under 5 whenever the
video is supposed to be top 5 under five
who always break the rules in these
videos
it was top 24 under 5 I woulda listed 21
that's just how it does
please check the down bar for my social
media before you leave and I hope to see
you in my next video bye sugar love the
reason I don't like to wear my hair down
a whole lot in videos because I do this
a touch and it's so distracting to
people and I'm sorry about the touching
but I'm a haircut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
