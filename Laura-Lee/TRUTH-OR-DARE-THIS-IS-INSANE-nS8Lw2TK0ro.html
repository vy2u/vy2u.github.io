times like it's just a lighting that's
not the best I feel like in videos I can
unlockable like it's the same whatever
but in photos for some reason like it

don't look like an hourglass I look like
a pencil it's just the lighting you
don't look bad it's that's my life motto
okay so this is get in there come on
