video is going to be a little bit
different than our normal makeup videos
I am doing in a more so an experimental
video whoo - Beauty I think she created
this technique I'm not sure but that's
who I first saw it by it is take
contouring and she showed how to like
get your contour place right on your
face using tape I'm gonna try this but
first I just want to say if you are
allergic to band-aids you're probably
allergic to adhesives and you should not
be trying this or you can use an
alternative it's called paper tape you
can buy it at any drugstore and it's
meant for your skin and most the time
it's hypoallergenic I don't have
sensitive skin whatsoever and I've never
been allergic to any adhesives so I'm
not gonna worry about it we're gonna the
tape on our face today and it's gonna be
a fun-filled video I don't even know if
it's gonna work out for me
it may it may be horrible we'll find out
just fun to experiment with our face hmm
we're gonna jump right in and get
started don't forget to subscribe to my
channel before you leave for more
experimental videos I'm gonna post three
videos a week there's a lot going on
here be sure to subscribe and we're
gonna jump right in we're gonna guess
okay so basically I have a picture here
of Hooda and how she like placed the
tape on her face so I'm gonna try to
place the tape on my face like she
placed a fake tape on her face that's a
lot of words one little thing I'm a
little skeptical is I put a very thin
layer of foundation on my face before I
guys start it which is what I typically
do and the tapes probably gonna pull
that off but once you blend it all out
with a Beauty Blender you probably won't
be able to tell what the tape pulled the
foundation off so I don't think it's
really gonna matter but um I'm just
gonna start with like a piece like I
don't know what is this like two inches
maybe it depends on the size of your
face - not everybody sheikhs the same so
this will be above my contour like yeah
you know what I'm saying yeah I'm gonna
try to create like a little triangle and
that'll be below my contour oh I like
that
okay that looks pretty you're thinking
I've lost my mind I lost that a long
time ago I got a lot face hair going on
right here and so this should be
interesting cooling it off I
my face thread at once and it was the
most excruciatingly painful experience
I've ever experienced in my life
and yeah it just ended up not looking
that great so now we're going to do the
nose um okay here I go
I'm a little nervous well just do like
right here now the tape stabbing man I I
think I'd toward that piece too long
dang can I put this piece too long to
have my nose tape a little that way it's
not too distracting because this is
normal
she had a little thin piece of tape
going down the middle so you get your
dark lines cuz you don't want the whole
you know top of your nose to be dark oh
huda beauty come come help me there it
is
this actually looks really good this
little thin piece you do what I'm saying
what we did here look at that thank you
oh don't mess up my eyebrow come on now
I should have waited to do my eyebrows I
don't know I did the temple area Lots
we'll just I don't know what I can but
I'll just put some right here because
I'm gonna like block off the chin cuz I
always do a little contour right through
here so I guess everybody's well I don't
guess I know everybody's face is
different and where you should be
contouring I guess you would just apply
the tape I feel like I'm about to go get
plastic surgery yeah I think I did it
right alright we're cool we're good now
what am i be using to contour today you
can use a darker concealer of any type
you can get a contour palette it's gonna
be a cream contour I wouldn't I don't
know if I would recommend doing this
with powder contour my freakin Tarte
thing breaks and like the inner liner of
the lid comes off it's so annoying but
this isn't just shade deep and basically
now you just play like you literally
just fill in the areas you know what I'm
sayin so we're just gonna color now oh
man I wonder if this shade is too dark
for me this is very interesting
oh my god please turn out good
you know we did our business and we're
gonna take the tape off now so this is
obviously the most fun part I'm gonna
start with my chin because this was very
uncomfortable
I don't seen you do that okay did pull
some foundation but there's actually no
foundation marks so the tapes obviously
not at aggressive that is way too much
product on my chin and that's no one's
fault but my own feels so good to get
this tape on my face okay ow my eye whoo
oh my gosh what happened here how did
this piece of tape just break in half oh
you know what there's still piece of
tape on my face all your tape play you I
just waxed my forehead I feel it it's
ripping the hairs out hey you know we
look pretty good now we're gonna blend
it all out which should be pretty
interesting I'm actually gonna use my
damp in a beauty blender and I'm just
gonna use the little butt side I always
think if this is like the butt of the
beauty lair
I know why I already know I got too much
stuff going on right here I normally go
to shoot and like I said that wasn't
required and take contouring that was
just something Laura did on her own I
put too much makeup on
yeah I am a little bit orange looking
and that is my own fault because I put
too much product at my taste because I
got a little overzealous and excited
with the tape it happens now I'm gonna
go in with a little bit of the naked
skin my Urban Decay this is just a
concealer I'm using shade medium light
and I'm gonna highlight my face and this
is also gonna help tone down the contour
here are the normal highlighting areas
I'm gonna go back in with the top of my
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna blend
all this out and hopes and prayers that
it all works out for me in the end and
we will go a lot better the how I
definitely did a number in diffusing out
that contour bit again that was my own
fault
I got overzealous if you try this at
home don't go crazy
we learned that together today what I'm
gonna do now is I'm actually gonna set
my whole entire highlight and then we'll
go in and we'll set our contour I really
think that this is working out for me
and the good good though this is Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder it's
awesome it doesn't flash back on you
with the camera just like a Holy Grail
product to me I'm now gonna take this F
25 brush from Sigma and I'll dust away
all of the powder okay and now we are
done um I think it turned out pretty
good I mean in the end I did have to
diffuse it type was very interesting on
my face again if you're allergic to
band-aids adhesive don't but tape on
your face or if your skin's just
sensitive I would stick with the paper
tape which is hypoallergenic you can get
a drugstore um you know if you're having
trouble getting your placement right
with contouring this just might be the
trick for you thank you for inspiring us
