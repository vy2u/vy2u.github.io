video is going to be another trying out
new products a bunch of first
impressions I'm going to be trying out
like a boatload of BH Cosmetics which
I've never tried before it's gonna be
like a first hand thing for me and they
have a bunch of awesome like affordable
stuff so I can't wait to see how it
works out try new foundations new
highlights all the new poppin stuff I'm
about to beat Ron and little video okert
love the way the makeup look came out
bomb diggity and I'm back to wearing a
nude lip forgive you girl but you know I
don't know why I'm such a nudie girl I
will let you know that in this video we
did have a few like products that didn't
work out for me and be sure to subscribe
to my channel before you leave hello
why would you not you would miss out on
everything happening on my channel so I
mean it is so hot in here I'm wearing a
bomber jacket for whatever reason I
thought it was cute but then I realized
I look like a pink lady with a choker it
in the bomber jacket like off greased
what's the gray song color I like it
work for Mary Kay okay but I do hope you
enjoy this little ol buddy I will let me
hello beautiful people out there just
checking the gram jumpin I'm gonna start
off with the make it forever I've never
tried this one this is the radiant
primer this when their skin equalisers
it's yellow like yellow I'm gonna start
off by applying this around my face as
my facial primer it feels really nice oh
look at that I had no idea it blend it
into your skin to where it isn't like an
actual color like blends nicely um next
up I have a product Rebecca I know this
one isn't like brand new but I haven't
talked about it on my channel it is and
or product this is their peach eye
corrector so it's supposed to help with
dark circles you can see right here I'm
I'm also going to be trying something
from BH Cosmetics which is an affordable
makeup brand so I definitely want to
test this out for you guys this is their
one to one garage I'm going to try out a
couple of different brushes from them
and I feel like you're not supposed to
put a lot of this in your under eye like
you're supposed to go light with this
I'll just stab myself in the eye why do
I do these things
get that dark circle the brush feels
really nice and soft so far so good
whenever you use these products you're
supposed to use to use a little bit not
like actually cake your whole under eye
towards orange because that's too much
makeup in its like a good cause for
creasing all right moving right along
something exciting to try outs that make
it forever water blend this is their new
foundation I've heard mixed reviews on
it so I don't know if I'm going to like
it it is called water blends so hence
it's going to be watery AF I'm excited
to try it out whenever using this BH
brush this one is 1:16 it feels very
nice oh this is like super watery and
like look at that like super sheer so
whoo-hoo I'm scared oh no how are you
supposed to use this I think I'm using
it wrong it's doing nothing like it
literally feels like I just put water on
my face it's covering nothing what is
this I shook it up well body and face
foundation but if it's a foundation it's
literally just like water I'm going to
try on this side of my face
so I think this is supposed to be like
an extremely sheer foundation realtalk
moment I don't know guys if this one's
for me it looks like I have no
foundation on and I have a full coat of
foundation on so I don't know what the
benefit of using it is supposed to be
alright no lie I'm going to have to add
a little bit more of a foundation I
think this is just what to be like
sheer foundation it feels a little bit
sticky stealing my skin I'm a little
confused by it I feel like I should do
more research first impressions is not
for me because I don't really like sheer
sheer makeup if I'm going to do your
makeup I normally just do a no makeup
day moving on I'm going to be using the
ex1 invisi wear foundation the BH
Cosmetics brush feels really nice
comfortable look you guys have tried out
any BH Cosmetics brushes before because
so far it feels really nice and I feel
like there should be more talked about
them so a good price point okay so my
conclusion on the water foundation it is
supposed to be 80% in water so it is
supposed to be just very sheer and I
guess thinking of makeup forever I don't
think sheer makeup so it confused me
it's just not for me
we're going to move on to eyes if our
chairman Hague is out of the totally
cute toothpaste palette I'm going to
take double scoop out of the palette
right here and I'm going to just blend
it around to soften up my eyeshadow
primer next I'm gonna take bunny foo-foo
it's just like a warm caramel color so
pretty and I'm going to blend it up in
my crease and I'm gonna use this as my
transition shade next up I'm going to
take the shade chocolate donut soak it
only testing out another BH brush this
is the one to two and I get just a
little bit of this color on the brush
and then I'm going to apply it kind of
focus it like on this outer corner it's
extremely pigmented so I am loving this
little totally cute palette from Too
Faced this is the very first time I've
ever used it and it's beautiful like the
shades are sickening oh and by the way
for those who don't know I mean
sickening and the best way possible I
mean so good I'm also enjoying these BH
Cosmetics brushes so far they feel
really nice like there's no fallout from
their soft they're picking up color
great I do like it
next up I'm going to dabble in the love
yourself a two palette this one is from
pur cosmetics and it comes with a Thai
shadows highlight blush bronzer lip
gloss
lip liner as well as mascara I'm going
to take this taupey brown color right
here and just soften up the edges of my
eye with it right in there and just make
sure everything's like super soft which
I use this palette once before and I
really enjoyed it so so far so good with
the palette the colors are nice payoff
the bronzer is a bit warm tone for my
skin tone so I do mix it with a little
bit of a cooler bronzer because I tempt
Li I tend to opt for a cool tone bronzer
and this one's a little bit more warm
for me but it is a really pretty palette
and I do like the formula of the powders
in it they're an ass
they're nice next up I'm going to be
trying out a new this is actually a big
lumen ating and bronzing palette this is
called wild and radiant from BH
Cosmetics and I'm going to mix these two
shades right here they're like these
baked beautiful shades together and I'm
going to put them on my eye to do that
I'm going to be using the BH 118 brush
so I'm just going to tap them and mix
them together and I am going to damp
them a little bit with a mac fix+ spray
if you guys want to know a weird and
kinda gross fact about me why am I
telling I don't even have to tell you
guys this but I'm telling you I'm
telling you because I guess I enjoyed
being judged on the internet I don't
know why but back in the day when I
lived in Alabama I used to lick my
makeup brushes and to wet them instead
of using like a setting spray or water
I will lick the brush go ahead leave
your comments down below but I'm just
gonna let you know you know I did what I
had to do I couldn't afford a mac fix+
spray in my life like there were a few
items from Mac that of course I could
afford like my eyeliner I had to have
and like my concealer and stuff like
that um but I couldn't really afford the
extra stuff and just let you know how my
makeup turned out it turned out just as
good as wetting them brush yo ooh I'm
going to dip a little bit back into this
palette and grabbed a little bit more of
chocolate donut just to blend out that
harsh area right there
next I'm going to take a little bit of
overexpose with just a highlight shade
I'm going to highlight my brow bone with
this color
I'm not going to wing it out in this
video but I am going to try out some new
lashes these are from the makeup Shack
and I believe they're faux mink lashes
they're very pretty
these ones are called bad gal so before
I do that I'm actually going to test out
on new mascara this one is from Make Up
For Ever it's called excessive lash and
it comes in a really odd packaging all
right so here is the one it has a lot of
product on it and I don't even know if
I'm using this right but I think I'm
just going to apply it straight to my
lashes the one is weird though oh my god
it is catching my lashes like crazy I
have to admit it's like grabbing the
lashes it almost has like a sticky
texture to it and it's really doing a
lot for my lashes right now like it's
like grabbing the lashes and pulling
upward which is really nice it's doing
it in a gentle way - oh my god look at
that
a Hello new favorite mascara I love guys
you don't understand my last just gross
straight out and that's all I got so I'm
gonna pop on the false lashes but I
adored the mascara I I didn't expect it
to be this good I don't know why I just
don't know but these lashes are
beautiful I'm just having a good eye
lash day all right I'm pretty sure you
guys are ready for me to cover up the
dark circle area on my eye I'm going to
be trying out the shape take contour
concealer this one is from Tarte
cosmetics I am in shade light/medium and
oh look at that applicator it's like a
big fat doe foot applicator I don't know
why I wasn't expecting that so yeah
we're just going to do the classic
triangles classic I did use this step
before for an Instagram video but for
some reason I completely forgot about
the fat Dhokla applicator
I don't know whom why I'm going to take
my 117 BH brush and I'm going to tap
this out tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip
tip tip
tiller is full coverage it is completely
different from their tarp by the sea
concealer and I do like it better than
the tarp I the sea concealer this one is
just like my preference is more creamy
than liquidy and like coverage hello
hello hi welcome next I'm going to be
trying out the contour palette from BH
this is a Studio Pro palette and I'm
going to mix together these two shades
to set my concealer so a lot as you can
see like a lot of powder can excuse me a
lot of powder came off of this palette
like it's pigmented so I'm just going to
press it in and then I'll brush away the
excess and kind of like baked my face
with this palette
so bringing next from the palette to
contour I'm going to be using this shade
right here on the end very pretty so I
do suggest just going in with a light
hand with this palette as you can see
like it's a pressed palette and I was
still able to bake my face with a shadow
or the shadows with the shades so it is
very pigmented and the colors come off
very easily so I wouldn't go in with a
heavy hand cuz I think you might end up
in trouble like a lot of makeup going on
on your face but I do like it a lot I
normally just contour around the temples
and really I'm not getting very serious
on my contour today I'm just like
bronzing up my skin now I'm going to
dust away the excess Pelt up going back
hand with the selfie to palette I'm
going to use photogenic for my blush
today and another exciting part of me
trying out for my highlight is the color
FX custom enhancer drops so I've been
debating like exactly how I want to use
this I just poured way too much out of
my hand
first of all so that's not going good
but they are very pretty and incredibly
pigment seriously poop so I'm just gonna
get some of my Beauty Blender and I
think I'm just gonna you know what I
mean oh my goodness is so pretty kind of
thing I got a little bit too much
product on my sponge and it looks like a
you know like it needs to be softened up
huh but it is pretty alright for the
other eyes I'm gonna go back in with
bunny foo-foo and apply it to the lower
lash line I am enjoying this palette so
I give this a good review now I'm going
to take a little bit of chocolate donut
and apply it a little bit closer to my
lower lash line
for lips I'm going to go in with joues
noisette and just apply this all over my
lips it's a liquid lipstick
now I'm going to go in with this BH nude
lips palette ha these shades are glossy
and I'm going to mix the two glossy
shades on then and apply it to the
cinema layouts like desert and lastly
I'm all set everything on my voice
alright guys this is the final look I
love the way that makeup came out the
foundation was a flop just for me I mean
I love the pH products that worked out
really nicely for me this was my first
impressions on them and they were all
pretty nice very pigmented and at a
great price point the cover PEX drops i
used way too much I learned that the
hard way but I think they look really
pretty they're not like actually that
crazy pigmented once you get it blended
on on your face I mean they are like a
subtle highlight believe it or not I
don't see that it's like crazy shibam
the pure palette is amazing I did enjoy
it the Becca peach color corrector was
very nice in the makeup forever mascara
bomb diggity so that's it for this video
