really quick before start the tutorial
this has just been my bread and butter
palette I've used it for over two months
almost every single day for almost two
months the feedback on it has been
Astron it's just been insane it's been
so sweet people have tweeted me and they
just gone their own and written to
people who were thinking about buying
and said it's the best thing they've
ever used they use it every day they
pack it for travel it's just been
amazing the matte colors to show creamy
and buttery and amazing to work with as
well as the foiled and the shimmery
shades but I'm going to show you me
putting it to work in this video right
here this is not one of my typical
makeup tutorials this is a talk through
this is me trying new products we're
going to talk we're in a chat we're
gonna love each other talk about life
love I'm drinking a Mexican Coke
so it's gonna be a little bit of a
longer video if you want to see just a
normal makeup tutorial using my palette
where I'm not trying out a bunch of new
products I got like three or four of my
channel so you know just any of my last
makeup tutorial I got you
I hope you guys enjoy the video be sure
to subscribe to my channel before you
leave for lots more testing out products
lunch you know the new new what's going
on in the beauty world we do it all
kinda stuff up and I would love for you
to be a part of my youtube family
whenever I started the tutorial I had
any strange contact and they started
like wandering around my eyes whilst
filming is like my I was over here and
then over here so I just took them out
so it's gonna look a little crazy in the
beginning but honey we power through it
just keep going alright let's get
started
babe babe ty get up there ty the first
product we're gonna start out with is
something
pretty excited about this is by Lancome
this is the miracle CC cushion and
purple is a color corrector that's
supposed to illuminate dull skin so it
comes in a compact like this little
smudger you know the business these
little cushion compacts and then it
comes with a supersaturated pad with the
purple this says it's a facial primer I
just peel the sticker off of it I've
never used it before and I'm going to
use it with a sponge guys I kind of feel
like I should use it on half my face and
do the other half of my face without it
so we can really see if it even makes a
difference let's do that so this side of
my face just remember this side with all
the zits
we applied we made my face purple and
then we want to put foundation on top of
it the sponge feels nice this is weird
doing it doing it for the tube so think
you're supposed to just dab a light
layer on your skin kind of like I have
on right now next up is foundation I'm
really excited to try this one out this
one is the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
so the other ones Pro matte this is a
brand new foundation and I am a shade
2:03 nude beige which I'm pretty sure
it's a little bit too light for me
because I swatch it on my hand and so
you see my neck is way darker than my
face so I normally kind of match it
right in here and it match my face
perfectly so I'm like that's gonna be
bright but I'm going to be testing it
out today oh my god super liquidy it's
just like pouring out whereas I know
that other foundation would not normally
do that so it definitely has a different
texture to it it was just like running
down my hand
kyoool I don't have a foundation
foundation brush on hand today so I'm
just using this Tarte brush I'm going to
apply the foundation on this half of my
face but I have another product I want
to test down the other half of my face
with it mm-hmm this is way too light I
would say medium coverage blends out
really easy but I mean it is a liquid so
they normally are super easy to blend
out so that doesn't look so bad as far
as the color pretty nice coverage as you
can see my skin looks wet it's like dewy
okay we're going to do the second half
of my face by adding a little bit of the
photo finish primer oh by Smashbox
you're supposed to add like a little
bitty bitty bit of this to your
foundation brush so I'm literally just
going to take my brush and I'm just
going to go do doop doop which three
drops is probably too much tie we let
the cats out they're freaking out my
cats are like clawing the door over
there and then we're going to blend it
out to see if it like makes a difference
it made it even more watery so it smells
good I don't notice any difference in
the coverage or texture but we really I
think we'll find out whenever we're done
with our makeup and it's like settled in
looks the same I feel luminous do you
see the shine on my know you can even
see it on my lip you can see it through
here honestly so far my first
impressions are if you only skin the pro
matte might be better for you than the
pro glow
okay moving on something I'm really
excited about this is a powder with
salicylic acid in it and I normally will
lightly sprinkle a powder over my
foundation just really lightly so we're
gonna be trying to foul I've already
tried this out though so I can tell you
guys a little bit about it I like it
especially if I'm having breakouts I've
been using it and I've been using the
lightest shade in it to set my concealer
it's really nice see so now I feel like
we have like a nice full-coverage
flawless finish do you guys tell the
difference with the purple and not I
real tall moment I can't tell the
difference
okay guys I'm taking these contacts out
like I tried with them and they're
wondering and it's getting on my nerves
no alright moving right now I'm gonna
try out the brow quickie it from
two-faced haven't applied to any type of
gel to my eyebrows but I have already
filled them in but I would normally
apply this after I fill them in anyway
so I in now I feel like it lightened my
bro
a little like the brunette shades a
little like so I like it I mean I I
think it compares to most of the tinted
brow gels feels pretty good next thing
I'm going to try right this is the color
correcting eyeshadow primer and medium
from Kat Von D it reminded me a little
bit of my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre so
I figured out today I would use this as
my eyeshadow primer instead of my Mac
Paint Pot this feels a little bit
tackier than my Mac Paint Pot so wish me
luck with the product you already knew
what I was using and I'm going to set
everything with basic right here this is
a plain matte shade I love these
eyeshadows obviously or I wouldn't
collab with a brand if I didn't love
their stuff but I do love these eyebrows
especially the matte shades I think
they're so creamy and they blend out so
incredibly easily it's like effortless
to work with them you don't have to like
manipulate them wet them you know do
anything with them there's amazing eye
shadow so I'm super excited about this
palette as you guys know the next shade
I'm going to be going in it with is
bridges which is like my favorite
transition shade again this is one of
the matte eyeshadow shades and it's so
pretty you can see right now I'm
blending it it just blends out so
incredibly easy and it's so pigmented
they're not chalky whatsoever I'm also
going to buff this shade a little bit
into the inner corner do you see that
like how easy that was to blend it was
like swipe wipe done the next shade I'm
going to take is fried which is a very
unique shade that I popped into this
palette and it's honestly one of my
favorite matte shades in this palette I
use it pretty much every day it's like a
mustard II baby puke yellow color and
it's so good I love this color and I my
skin take this e 38 blending brush from
Sigma which is the one I've been using
the whole time and I'm going to buff it
into the outer corner and just
it all around I mean look how pigmented
that those two matte eyeshadows are it's
crazy next I'm going to take a bit of
Alabama which is just one of those
mandatory shades I have to have the zoom
eye makeup it's a nice warm toned brown
color and I'm going to take this pencil
brush this one is at e30 from Sigma and
what I like to do is be really defining
and just push this into the outer corner
rather than taking it up high and
blending it all around will soften it up
in a minute I'm just placed in color
right now where I want it
I actually went a little too far on this
side and then I'm going to take the e25
blending brush do you see how it's a
little bit harsh in that corner right
there that's where you can really soften
it up guys also guys I have like I'm
always brainstorming cool video ideas
that are original for you guys because I
know I'm sure you get tired of seing in
the same ol same ol same ol
and I have a few of my sleeve that I
can't wait to post for you guys this
video is probably going to go live on
Wednesday I'll be in New York right now
when this video is live hey guys I'm
working on a project with Tati you guys
don't love Tati the glam life guru do
you see how I just like softened up
those edges and then what I'm going to
do is go in with bubs which is our
deepest brown color in the palette and
this is more of a little bit of a cool
tone brown color which again is like
manatorian in a new palette we're
working on all mattes and as you can see
they just blend out so beautiful I can't
I can't I came in dil but anyways this
one isn't Bub's and I'm going to take it
back on the pencil brush and just deepen
up and layer it on top of Alabama I did
named all the colors my palette if you
guys want to know like a lot detail
about the palette I did a full dedicated
video the videos like my eye shadow
palette that's like the title of it but
I did fully create the palette you know
and I'm really excited about it and you
guys haven't be anza beyond supportive
with it it's been amazing I've seen it
floating around YouTube and everyone's
been so amazing okay so as you can see I
did the exact same thing I placed the
color and now I'm just
blend it out and soften it up not taking
it up too high and then I'm going to
bring it on around this Center okay so
for the shimmery colors and eyeshadow
the best way to apply them is with a
flat synthetic brush kind of like this
that picks up a lot of color and they're
great for packing colors on the lid so
this is like honestly either this or a
pencil brush will be your best option
for applying the shimmery colors and
this is the e58 brush from Sigma I'm now
going to take 1988 from my palette so
pretty so pretty I'm gonna pop it right
where we left it blank in the center of
our eyelid to give it like a fiery look
this is one of my favorite colors on my
palette and I promised I would use in a
look so here we are
look how glowy so you don't even have to
dampen these colors you totally can and
they perform well but I think they
perform well without being dampen
because they are kind of like a foiled
eyeshadow 1988 that I'm using right now
is a bit duochrome so if you can see as
I get golden flecks in it and it's like
a fiery Rose Goldy pink color it's such
a unique color that I'm absolutely in
love with so now I'll go back in with
that little pencil brush and just soften
up the edges to make sure they're not
harsh I'm going to take a little bit of
sugar this is a shimmering light color
and I can pop it onto the brow bone and
next I'm going to be testing out a new
product from Maybelline this is the
master precise curvy liquid liner I
thought this was a mascara actually had
it my mascara tour it's so weird
look at it just better not mess up my
eyeshadow I'm not going to wing it out
I'm simply lining my lid in order to
apply flash lashes did you hear me false
lashes guys sometimes I get so deep into
doing my makeup bikini I don't even know
what I'm saying honestly with this liner
I can see a little bit of my eye shadow
coming through the liner I think I don't
think I could use this to create a wing
because it's just kind of gimmicky the
little end of it I don't know if I like
it guys it's like not dry whatsoever
like there's a lot of liner in the
it's just like you can see my golden
eyeshadow come through it right there in
the center or mascara I'm going to be
trying out that si edit this is the
edges mascara and it's like gold in
there's like a primer oh no it's not
it's what wha linked and volume with
these I kind of love that with these
mascaras okay so we're about to try it
out although I will be adding false
lashes later because you know I can't
help myself so this one is the volume
side and I'm just gonna flicker this on
and then I'll go back in with the
lengthening side so it looks like it
would separate the lashes this might
this is not doing much for my lashes no
help me if I was not going to wear false
lashes I would be upset right now but
we're going to try the double-ended
other into the little Stickley in with
the hard brush this in seems way better
way better I don't know if you guys can
see my lashes cuz they suck but I like
them better Oh No
so the one stabbed me in the eye and now
I hate everything I'm gonna do the whole
fashion trick where you let it dry and
flick it off with a spoolie and we'll
see what happens that's what I normally
do but it's normally not this bad of a
situation with my mascara these lashes
are so dramatic and of it these are NYC
by Lily lashes and they are so panting
do you ever have those moments where
you're sitting on your couch watching
Netflix going through the gram you
didn't liked everybody's picture you're
not seeing everything you don't know
anyone at all but then you're busy doing
something in the whole wide world like I
got what's up and you're like no no not
now these lashes have worn probably I
don't know 12 14 times I'm not even
kidding
um so they're already cut and sized to
my eyelid nicely so they're really easy
to apply there's so much drama and I
love them look at all that lash glue it
should dry black it will dry black okay
this mascara takes a long time to dry my
lashes are soaking wet and they're going
together look at that oh okay I'm gonna
be honest I don't like the mascara just
pure honesty first impressions No maybe
y'all give it another try
I don't know I'm kind of upset about
this are there actual lyrics to
Rihanna's work song do we all know what
she's saying
nah hmm oh my god I almost double
stacked the lashes that tells you what
level I'm on today because this mascara
is taking forever to dry I don't really
see the whole mascara trick with the
spoolie working but we'll try it you
know what it's not working and it's just
hurting my eye so I'm just going to get
make it wipe and handle this so these
lashes are still wet but they're not as
gooey as these I think I just apply they
take it takes too long to dry and I
didn't realize that so I messed that up
all right moving on we're gonna go and
use the Born This Way concealer I've
used this concealer before if you're on
the fence about buying it I'll just let
you know I personally love it
okay I've highlighted the areas that
normally highlight my face I'm just
going to take a kabuki brush from Sigma
and just buff this out I believe this is
an f-86 and I like to tap to buff it out
honestly because you don't want to move
your product around too much okay I did
the concealer and then I set it with my
Laura Mercier powder which you've seen a
million times and I'm not going to beat
a dead horse and then my camera stopped
recording not cool anyways we were
trying out a new bronzer this one's by
the essay Edit this is called the
Bharath bronzer this is number one light
medium and as I was saying before my
camera quit recording this it comes with
like a splash of a highlight on it but
as you can see the highlight doesn't
actually go all the way through the
bronzer it um it's like just a one
little top layer so you it's like a
one-time use of a highlight on the
bronzer so this is my first impressions
on it and by the way I'm using the f40
brush from Sigma I think it's so
beautiful
I think the bronzer is gorgeous it is
incredibly pigmented
but if you go in with a heavy hand which
I just did right here and I was in the
midst of trying to get that blended out
it was like explosion of makeup on my
face you're gonna be in trouble
I got powder up in my bra y'all because
I'm having a hard time getting it to
diffuse but as you can see like look how
pigmented and pretty that is it's like a
good color - yes cheekbones I'm going to
now flicker
away any excess Laura Mercier powder
that I used to set that concealer and
then I'll take a bit of that as day edit
bronzer I'm just going to contour my
nose this is the JT waiting 180
sculpting brush trying to get my nose
next this bronzer if you use the right
amount of it it's actually quite subtle
you can even put bronzer like right in
here and give it like the illusion of a
fuller little plump pout
peretta next up for blush I talked about
this blush all the time but I've never
used it in a tutorial and I'm gonna use
it in Rimmel London this is golden
bronze little kit and this one's number
303 the darkest one so I'm going to take
this pretty shade so pretty just pop it
on it's like gold in a little bit it
kind of matches my eyes yes please oh
I'm flushed okay what's up next is the
highlight so for my highlight today I'm
going to be testing out these from
Revlon no these are from Maybelline
these are the master strobing stick this
one is number two medium I actually want
to use the light one this is number
light arrad essent and it's like a pinky
color I'm excited about it let's see
what happens alright so we applied it
and I'm just going to blend it out with
my finger it's pretty it's um you know
with me like this with all the light
shutting down but I kind of think like
in normal daytime you wouldn't really be
able to notice too much or maybe this is
a daytime highlight and then you want to
bring out your ship BAM highlights for
nighttime what a Mandy next is going
with the new honest Asha Beverly Hills
Sun dipped glow palette which looks like
this it's so pretty
and I'm just going to add a little bit
on top this one is summer this is my
favorite one out of the palette because
you guys know like I'm not playing games
here this is a Smith 112 brush by the
way yes so now I'm going to go ahead and
finish the under eyes because as you can
see we haven't done
anything to those I just smashed a brush
into my palette I'm going to take
britches and I'm going to blend that all
the way out here and just bring it all
the way in I'm going to take bubs on
this ether TT brush and I'm going to pop
it in the outer corner and just bring it
on and and then I'm going to put a
little bit of Alabama I'm going to go in
with the brand-new I think this is
brand-new from Ostia this is their
waterproof darkside liner it's just a
liner pencil and I think it stays really
well in the waterline I wore the other
day it's not as like milky as the other
eyeshadow I mean as the other eyeliners
but normally the ones that come off like
super easy are the ones that don't stay
so this one you have to just go back and
forth a couple of times but this one
stays really well into the waterline
which the makeup world needed another
one of these so thank you a BH you know
there's like an ongoing debate because I
call it honest Tashia honest Asia
everybody calls it something different
and you know what in my personal opinion
I think what does it matter because if
you know what I'm talking about then it
really doesn't matter what I call it
because if we're all on the same page
here the little petty things in life I'm
going to go back in with the essay edit
and I'm using the little spooley side or
the little plastic side not this bristly
one to these bottom lashes alright
Smashbox came out with the new liquid
lipsticks I've never worn them before
i've swatched on but i haven't worn them
don't you know I want to do nude so this
one's out loud and the one I really want
to do is always on which is like a pinky
nude not really a nude well thing is if
I play at my eyes I'm not gonna put on
like a hot pink lipstick it doesn't
match so you know what I don't have any
of the really nude ones out of these
Smashbox guys so I'm not going to be
able to try them
I do have these brand new liquid
lipsticks from bareMinerals and this one
is in cold so I'm going to take my
Mack stripped-down lip liner which is
what I always use you guys know I can't
let it go and I'm going to line my lips
you know I like to look like I've been a
tin dodo I'm too much today okay we're
taking Colt oh that's pretty
he's kind of taste like cookies I'm just
crazy they don't taste like cookies I
feel like you should add some gloss on
top this one is called fly you guys
follow me on snapchat
I like beasts watching all this stuff
you know I'm saying like all my VR and
lastly I'm going to set everything with
my mac fix+ spray this is the final look
I hope you guys enjoy the video I love
the way the eyes turned out so good I
can't tell the difference from the
purple from the purple illuminator I do
wear a heavier makeup like with the
whole concealer bronzer highlight blush
so maybe that covered it up I feel like
the foundation looks great like good
like I feel like my skin looks nice guys
and I just drug it on down I love it I
hope you guys enjoyed watching thank you
