in this room hey guys welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be a
fun one well they're all fun duh we're
gonna be testing out a lot of weird
beauty products I have the derma flash
from fuzzy to fabulous skin this is a
face shaver and exfoliator a naked nails
nail polisher it's like an as seen on tv
deal as well as another as seen on TV
hair straightener thing like it strained
your hair I don't know we're gonna try
it out I have an Ulta beauty eyelash
curler heated up thing I'm really bad at
explaining what these are a vibrating
foundation applicator and elf face
massager also I'm doing a big
back-to-school giveaway on my channel
and I'll put the link to that video down
below it's so easy to enter all the
rules are in the description of the
giveaway video so that video will be
linked in my description be sure to
enter them giving away a MacBook I'm
giving away Apple watch and so so so so
much more and one last announcement my
pallet is officially back in stock so
you can purchase it I'll have it linked
down below as well we're going to jump
right in the video now and get on start
it and get on start we're just going to
get started for the first product I have
washed my face because I can't wear
makeup to do it it's the dermaflage this
is an exfoliating facial treatment as
well as like a peach fuzz shaver so it
shaves the hair off your face as well as
is folates your skin at the same time so
it's like a two-in-one this is a Sephora
just to unveil smoother radiant younger
looking skin as well as get rid of the
peach fuzz I'm going to be honest I've
already tried this out because whenever
I got it I can oh I could not wait I
mean come on I've done videos before a
video for on like my face shaving
experience but I have a lot of facial
hair and like fuzzies especially around
this area so whenever I get a park like
this I was like oh hey yes it comes with
a charging station that looks like this
and you set the derma flash on it and it
rests like that so it doesn't have a
blade in it whenever you have it
comes with a little tray with blades
which looks like this so to apply the
blade to the derma flash you're going to
slide it up on to the tool so you just
hook it on there and slide upward and
you hear it click so it looks like that
it's like stuck on the tray and then you
literally just pop it up and it comes
off and now you'll see it has a blade so
according to the instructions you never
want to apply it at a 90 degree angle
just like straight on your skin it's
like got these little soft sides and you
just rest it on your skin and you work
your way down
it comes with a prep and then like a
finish cream so my skin is clean and
then you apply the clear prep gel which
looks like this and let me just say one
thing that I do love love love about
this tool as I mentioned before at my
face shaving video that whenever you get
rid of the baby hair on your skin the
texture can be different on your makeup
this doesn't make the texture different
it all looks the same and your skin's
very soft when you finish because it's
not only removing the hair it is
exfoliating and it's not painful at all
so what you're gonna do is you hold this
down for three seconds and it turns on
you hear her and she cute and it lights
up so you know it's on you fill it with
a very light vibrating you can really
lightly hear it cutting the hairs so
just in case you're wondering the tool
doesn't pull the hair out so it doesn't
hurt at all and like it's not like
snatching the hair it's actually
trimming in the hair so it is a pain
free little booger and you also just
hold it down for three seconds and then
it turns it off and don't forget to
dispose of the razor it's like a
one-time-use razor and then lastly you
add the finishing cream all over your
skin and then you will be finished this
is a really cool one and this is a yes
for me next up we have a heated eyelash
curler I found this at Ulta and like the
little shim dig section with all the
random stuff that's a great area for
impulse buying things that you do not
need
our life so I picked it up I applied the
battery in it and it has like these
little coils running through it in
little bars you're just supposed to run
it up your bare lashes so we're going to
give it a go until the backside of it
and it has gotten warm I'm so excited to
try it out my lashes grow pretty much
straight out or downward so here I go
ooh it is a warm sensation I don't see
that it's doing anything curl little
lashes curl it's not doing anything yo
I'm not noticing a difference to make it
worth my while
like they're barely standing up more and
it is pretty darn warm I'm going at this
for a hot minute and I I mean like I
barely notice the difference so this was
a little poopoo product that definitely
didn't work out and I don't recommend so
we're going to test out the nail product
this is the naked nails electronic
manicure tool I found this at Walgreens
because you know they have like the
little as seen on tv section at
Walgreens I am gonna have to use Tyler's
nails Tyler get in here come on in the
Miche I get in here now
where are you I don't know no yeah you
need to have a seat I think you're gonna
have to see enough and just put your
hand in you know why after you said no
cuz you can see Ernie
get up no babe we need batteries and a
lot of babe I need a lot of batteries I
need to can you give me this
oh so you it that where did that go babe
they're falling out everywhere this is s
they come with a bunch of little heads
to go on them to do different things I
assume okay so it looks like it comes
with four high shine attachment for
buffing attachments and for filling
attachments I'm not going to do the
filling one but I'll do the buffing and
high shine and we'll see if it works I
have the buffing one on right now which
is the purple one
give me a freshly-cleaned now over here
his nails these are just terrible I'm a
better now than that this one okay but
here are his nails are you are you ready
oh is this gonna hurt I don't know so
this one is for buffing
oh it's powerful to be it's not going
deep it's not gonna it's very it's um
it's weird to maneuver oh it why and why
can't you do this on yourself because I
have on my gel now you didn't take the
job
Oh around the world it's getting high oh
no thanks it smell like burning finger
now what we need you smell burning
finger now I used to work for
dermatologists we burn everything
fingernails fingernails for cash comp
finger nails for cash remember they're
just finger nails so don't expect much -
hey if someone can comment down below
and tell me what that song came off of I
love you brothers
oh I'm sorry yes yeah no okay I think
I'm not a professional at this so I am
damaging his nail no it'll be out of
focus
show him your net it looks then nail it
I say it works though okay so let's do
the shiny money like that just before it
comes with a square and you just like
pop it on there okay hi shiny Tatchell
do the fourth finger which I haven't
left yet
this one is this one it just is hard
no it's one two that hurt oh so it's not
getting hot Oh a Shawnee look at your
now look here it was like it has polish
on it showing you now I don't know if
you we go to see you see how shiny that
nail is compared to the robot it works
yes
so I would say this this words naked
nails works no no next we're gonna go
ahead and do this one because the other
ones off to take off my makeup for stop
do not return this product to the store
read below first that's just scary
so it's a plugin not battery-powered
it's very heavy
hairbrush plus/minus settings and then
the power so it goes up to 450 degrees
Fahrenheit it looks like this it is
heavy hair isn't really straight it's
not really curly but I mean it's got
them it's got some work that can be
applied to it the rules on this product
are very standard you're supposed to
hold your hair tight place it in there
and slowly run it down your hair and you
just do it a couple of times until it
straighten to your desire you're
supposed to separate your hair in
sections just like I've done here
alright so it is heat it to 450 you're
supposed to literally to place your hair
in it and just go on down the pink part
of the brush is rubber so it's really
pulling my hair and it kind of hurts
interesting so let's do it one more time
it's uncomfortable and I would
definitely say this is going to take
double the time to straight my hair
versus using my actual hair straightener
so I think it advertises it like a
hairbrush that you can just like brush
your hair like this and it strains it
but definitely not the case you have to
use it just like a hot tool and my hair
is not like super board straight which
is nice but if you want
that that would be a little more
difficult to achieve with this brush all
right so we're trying this piece now a
little bit smaller piece and you have to
finagle it down into the brush and then
just slowly now it's pulling my hair and
work it on down so yeah I would
definitely say it's straightening the
hair but do you see how the hair has
like a little bit of body in it still so
that's actually nice it's just like it's
really pulling my hair
do you see how much hair this brush is
pulling out because of the rubber it's
just like ripping out my hair I'm gonna
have only done two pieces I did get this
at Walgreens it is asking on TV how
should we pay for this time no I think
it was like 30 to 40 yeah thank you us
between 30 and 40 bucks so wasn't that
cheap and I wouldn't use it just to be
very honest with you I wouldn't use it
it's pulling out my hair and it's taking
too long straighten it this is a no from
me next one is a very simple one this is
the picture massager from ELF and it was
very affordable I just wanted to try it
on on the side it massages the skin to
help relieve tension and help rejuvenate
for glowing looking skin so basically
it's just a Rolly thing for your face
and it's supposed to help your face
absorb moisturizers and relieve tension
it says roll it feels good it doesn't
feel that good I lied it felt good for
two seconds right here like it feel like
something massaging my skin and then it
was like ow whenever it gets on the bone
it doesn't feel too good but you know
what it feels good on the neck but
whenever you get like on your cheekbone
or like the bridge of your nose it hurts
really bad because it's like super pokey
let me know down in the comments if you
tried something like this and do you
think it really makes a difference with
the intake of moisturizers what do you
think and what's the logic behind the
poking us I know someone out there knows
is watching this let me know your
thoughts I'm I'm I'm low-key confused
cool last I have a vibrating makeup
applicator I've had this little booger
for a while now and you just press the
little button it
turns on and it vibrates on it is an
exchangeable pad that comes off and
obviously I've used it before because
normally the pad is white you're
supposed to just be able to like smooth
out your foundation with it all right so
I'm going to show you it working
supposed to just turn it on again it's
vibrating I don't know if you can hear
that and the years you're supposed to
lightly smooth out your foundation with
it so when I tried it out in the past it
was just another product that was just
like a bit gimmicky for me um it just
took too long to smooth out the makeup
like I could do my makeup in half the
time with a makeup brush I didn't really
care for it honestly hey it sounds like
a little no power tool in my face the
material on the cloth feels really soft
and nice and all that jazz it's really
hard to get your foundation applied
evenly with the product just because the
head on it's so tiny and you had to do
your whole face like rubbing this little
tiny head around so it's just too much
for me it's silly I don't really care
for and I don't recommend it I think
it's kind of pricey to it think it's
around sixty bucks so it's just a
product that um it's just not for me
it didn't work out for me I wanted to
test it out because it's such a weird
product and let you guys know about it
and know what's out there on the market
but it's a little for me that's it for
this video guys thank you so much for
being here thank you so so much for
watching
