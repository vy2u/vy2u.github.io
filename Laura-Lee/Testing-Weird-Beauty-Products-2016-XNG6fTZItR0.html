video is going to be another series of
me testing out very strange beauty
products that have the foxy bay hair
brush and then I have a couple very odd
makeup products I'm going to be testing
out for you guys in today's video so it
should be pretty exciting if you're
wondering why I'm not wearing my makeup
it's because I'm like saving my eyes to
test out some of these products so they
won't already have makeup on them so
we're going to go ahead and jump right
in and get started be sure and subscribe
to my channel before you leave and yeah
we're gonna go ahead and I like
stretching and pulling my arms a lot
because it's been a long time since I
wore a tank top so now I'm just like oh
but uh yeah so we're gonna go ahead and
jump right in let's get started like I
said the first hole because my hair is
looking a little cry cry today I really
want to test out is the foxy BAE brush
I've seen miracles happen for this brush
online it comes in this very nice box
and then you get the brush you get a
very nice velvety bag that it goes in as
well as a glove so you don't burn your
little hand with working your hair
through the brush I've used this once
before already and I was very pleased
with the result so I'm excited to try it
out on camera and show you guys how I
used it and my thoughts upon it and show
you kind of how it works by the way this
is called the foxy babe
rose gold hair straightening brush so my
hair is about four or five days old
probably needs to be washed and it also
comes with this little clip that I'm
going to use to pin up my hair I'm going
to turn it on by hitting the power
button and the instructions are to
adjust the heat to double click the
power button and then yeah you can turn
it on up I'm gonna crank her all the way
up it heats up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit
I just take it and put the hair in it
and then kind of press the hair towards
the back of the brush and then just run
the brush through it and it really gets
all the hairs because it brushes the
hair as it's straightening it which is
really cool also this was sent to me in
a PR package and with it they had put a
discount code in there and it was for
45% off which is a really good deal and
that code is foxy Laura so I will have
that down in the description box for you
guys as well
what I like about the brush is that it's
easy to use and it doesn't clamp your
hair with a hair straightener so you get
more volume in your hair because it's
not pressing the hair down and it can be
a little bit quicker than using a flat
iron
so what's also cool about the hair
straightening brush is that it's got
tourmaline technology and adds shine you
don't have to add extra product in your
hair serums and glosses to give it that
shine that really weigh your hair down
so that way your hair still has a lot of
volume so I have tried out another
version of this brush before it was like
a as seen on tv version that I found in
the drugstore and it didn't work half as
good as this one is working here the
whole brush was made of rubber and was
like ripping out my hair whereas this
one isn't made of rubber that didn't
even make any sense to make a hair
straightening brush out of rubber
because your hair pulling through rubber
it was it didn't feel good this one
isn't so your hair slice through it very
easily and it makes it a much more
pleasurable experience so I really like
the foxy Bay one but the other ones I
can't speak for because they didn't work
out for me so see my hair has all this
volume going on we're just going to
brush it and strain it also I think this
brush would make a really cute Christmas
present
and here is the finish results my hair I
think it looks so good and shiny so our
next product is very interesting and a
subscriber had recommended it to me with
a lid of it go here we go it is a
Cheetos bronzer by the actual food
Cheetos and it's just as orange as a
cheeto and no it doesn't smell like a
Cheeto although I really wish it would
smell like a cheetah because that would
be so good so thank you so much for
recommending this as a weird product me
to test out of course I bought it was
like I have to I'm just a huge cheater
lover so I'm going to test it out the
weird thing about the product is it's
cream it's orange it literally looks
I've been digging it in a bag of Cheetos
and it says it's activated by water in
other words I'm pretty sure about to
destroy this face makeup but we bout to
do it for the YouTube you know what I'm
saying
it's a Cheetos bronzer we got to figure
out what it's all about what if I put it
on and it's like beautifully bronze
that's not gonna happen but so I just if
you can see I dampened it and now all
this pretty little brush this is the
morphe y4 brush I'm just going to
stipple it it's what it says - oh my why
why would they make this product I
online ty actually ordered it for me so
I didn't see what it looked like before
oh is a thing oh boy
so does it okay come mm-hmm well she's
contoured okay guys I tried it so I
don't know it just looks like honestly
I've been playing in Cheetos I think
this might be a gag gift uh-huh Wow
Jason Evan help me Oh what is also face
why is this product made do people
actually buy this I don't know it's on
Cheetos website I'm gonna shove my head
and a bag of Cheetos
okay next we're going to move on because
I don't think there's any much more I
can say about this product
other than what the hell did I just do
okay cool next we have I shadow stencils
now seeing eyebrow stencils before and
products kind of like that but I've
never seen a shadow stencils and what's
cool is they have all different eye
shapes so I mean that seems a little bit
more usable than the generic stencils
oh that one's gonna be too big I think
I'm gonna have to do I mean they
literally yeah like that
so we're just gonna take one shade of an
eye shadow and put it on here and just I
just have these on Sasha Beverly Hills
eyeshadows I'm just gonna grab a little
eyeshadow brush this one's nice and
dirty this is at 8:25 I'm Orange
so mint right on this side I'm just
going to put it right at that lashline
and kind of press it down pretty pretty
hard that way that eyeshadow doesn't
leak out oh come on oh fudge by the way
I found these little guys off Etsy I'm
going to do a very neutral tan shade to
give this a fair shot kind of hard
keeping it perfect on the eyelid um I
feel like it would just be easier to do
it without the stencil and all honesty
why not try this one's huge but I'm
gonna try it and that way you can get
that nice smoky eye oh it hurts to blink
with this on there I'm going to put some
red out here
no I just feel like it would be easier
to just do the makeup without the
stencil I mean it all depends on what
you want there's no rules and makeup a
look I'm softening this up now I'm just
moving product
okay so I have Cheetos in my hair
probably enough to take a shower after
this next up we have another strange
product it is called mascara cake I
bought this three or four months ago
meaning to do a video on it and Here I
am so I'm mentioning it in my own beauty
products weird strange whatever odd
beauty products video it's a black
mascara cake and it showed it on
sephora's website as you could use it as
a mascara or as an eyeliner and it's
literally a block and it confuses me I
have a clean spoolie brush which is what
you're supposed to use it's water
activated and you could use it for your
brows your lashes whatever you want to
you wet the brush you work it on the
surface of the cake get your desired
consistency and you can use it you know
however you want to do it I got my brush
pretty wet it's pretty much soaked and
I'm just going to swirl her just swirler
around on the cake so here I go oh well
I mean it just you know it's too
gimmicky for me and I'm going to say
that because with the water activation
it makes the product very watery like it
feels like the world's watery is mascara
and it's not really clean into the
lashes it might just be more so just to
dye the lashes darker just to add
pigment to the lashes not actually be
like a mascara cuz I feel like mascaras
are all about the consistency of the
product no I think it has the potential
to make a really good eyeliner
I'm dampening a sigma e25 brush and I'm
gonna just get some product on the brush
kind of dry not bad as an eyeliner but
it's not what I prefer like I think it's
just easier to buy a gel eyeliner than
having to make your own product with a
liquid so I don't really recommend this
product this is just too gimmicky for me
and same with the Cheetos
okay next product this is the last
product to have a test out this is like
a lash staple gun it's by flirt oh I
don't know exactly how you use her but
we're about to find out probably messing
it up what am i doing I went online to
read a little more about this because I
rolled this little twisty right here
about 50 times and none of the lashes
were coming out and so I just kept
rolling it and I was about to panic I
was like oh no does it work is out of
lashes but I never used it before by the
way and it just keeps scrolling so I see
right there we have a little lash
starting to peek out these are not full
ship lashes these are just little pieces
of lashes and it gives you the
instructions online it looks pretty easy
to do so we're going to see if that is
so you're supposed to pull the lash for
do you see it peeking out right there
that's a little first strip add a little
bit of lash glue to it wave it to let it
dry I'm gonna add this like super good
lash glue from mosquito to give it the
benefit of the doubt just to the tip
whenever the lash is exposed you're
actually supposed to press down and it
like Clips the lash in there and that
way won't fling out when you're trying
to apply glue next it says apply glue
and then wave it to get the glue to
become a little tacky oh God kind of
nervous
it says stretch the eyelash out so it's
out and then you're holding the lash on
with the top button and then you're
applying it to here and then you just
let it go and it did it just popped
right out now this is a fun example to
show you guys how my lashes suck and
they grow straight down and like normal
lashes kind of flicker up I think but
yeah my don't it cost me I think around
28 30 bucks and then
shipping too so wasn't that affordable
and once it runs out of washes I don't
think you can refill it that's already a
no for me for repurchasing I wouldn't do
it let's say you never wear false lashes
ever and you're going to a special event
then we just let go it didn't let go the
lash let go okay and you really want to
be buff in your lashes thing this could
be a cool way to get those lashes
applied because I would say strip lashes
or the little individuals are kind of
difficult to apply and this may make it
a little easier but guys it's expensive
or a few rounds of lashes I want to say
you get like 40-something lashes but
that's expensive I would add about five
pieces of lash per eye you probably
can't take me serious because of all
don't want on my face but this is a good
example it works it's just there's a few
things about it that are cons such as it
not being refillable and it's a little
gimmicky it's a little pricey and
gimmicky so well there you have it lash
tape ler gun works it was like success a
face looks crazy alright guys that is it
for this video so the hair straightener
definitely worked out great for me the
Cheetos bronzer I don't understand why
they make this product or what it's
supposed to do the mascara cake I think
is just more trouble than it's worth
the lash stapler definitely worked and
was a success it just is kind of pricey
and you can't refill it oh yeah we did
the eye stencils - those are okay I'm
not gonna knock those completely because
I feel like they could help people get
the eyeshadow place and then the person
could blend out the eyeshadow once it's
on there I yeah I look like I just
rolled around on a bed of Cheetos which
I'm not mad about that because I would
like to roll around in a bed of Cheetos
but other than that that's it for this
video thank you guys so much for being
here I'm watching and I'll see you all
in my next video okay how does smell
know Dan even smell like Cheetos which I
think the whole point in buying this is
at least so you'll smell like Cheetos
smells like absolutely nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
