channel today we're going to be testing
out some real we're makeup that I've
just picked up here and there and
they're in here I just kind of honestly
just gathered a bunch of weird things
when I have a good collection I filmed
this video so I have some really
interesting pieces and I can't wait to
try them out some may work some may not
work I definitely feel like a couple or
not going to work with they may surprise
us so we're going to try it out anyways
and if you haven't already be sure to
subscribe and we're going to go ahead
and jump right into the video ok first
things first is get this long piece of
hair off my arm I hate to feeling a hair
all over me second thing is I'm going to
go ahead and put on cat ears to get the
hair I don't have my extensions in today
and I feel a little bit nakey I don't
know why I'm so addicted to extensions
they're kind of like false lashes once
you start wearing on girl you just can't
stop it's like oh my gosh I feel so
incomplete so don't recommend trying I
mean I do but I don't because of the
addiction because I'm like almost on my
hair I have no hair but I do have hair I
just feel like I don't because all in my
head okay I leaned up I have a lot of
weird lip product to chest out I guess
we'll just get started with it first I
have let's show some mood gloss first I
picked up at t.j.maxx this is called
mood gloss it says in a different
language reacts instantly with your lips
to create your own perfect shade of a
glossy pink that lasts up to 5 hours
Oh golly for $2.99 so it says it
instantly changes with your mood okay
I'm going to try it out I'm gonna tie it
out and try it out
looks kind of clear it's clear okay
let's see
okay I definitely see we got some pink
going on right there oh it's definitely
working my lips are turnin pretty darn
pink I look at well they're turning very
pink you know a low-key feel like I feel
like it turns the same color for
everyone this is just like a conspiracy
theory basically it turns the same color
for everyone it just goes from like
clear to hot pink but it works it's
changing colors it does what it says so
daggum we're in the video just like what
a couple minutes and we already got a
winning product oh I went ahead and took
it off with about more lip products to
try out my shorter lips so next I'm
going to try out this product from ciate
it's called magic power potion I don't
know what it's supposed to do so let me
look it up real quick oh it's a lip
plumper primer so it's supposed to plump
the lips and it neutralizes your natural
lip color and extends we're for
visibility smoother fuller looking lips
well there's a lot of claims on it so
let's see if it works okay I put on a
fair amount the way actually we're going
to find out this works if I let it set
there for a minute so the next product
I'm going to try out is a dropper from
glossy air is the perfecting skin tint
and I look this product up and it said
I'm trying to look it up again because I
didn't screenshot it can we just talk
about how this is getting like oddly
matte five shades I got the shade dark
but it really doesn't seem that dark and
then it says to shake it well squeeze
gently a perfect skin tint into the tip
of your fingertips and smooth all over
your moisturize face writer and blurring
effect while minimizing the appearance
of pores my lips are tripping me out huh
okay I shook it up I gotta take my
knuckle rings off shoot I'm going to rub
it together and blend upward huh doesn't
smell like anything I'm going to get a
little bit more because I like to
overuse products
it feels really moisturizing lips I
think my skin does look dewy but they
weren't kidding when they said sheer
coverage because I would just say
honestly stuff is pretty much going on
clear like I feel like it's just like a
tinted moisturizer without the tint so
maybe just like a weird liquidy
moisturizer I shook it really well and
I'm getting a lot of pigment out of it
but whenever you rub it in lets see any
color and I got the shade dark I don't
hate it
because I mean it says it's claims I
wish I had a little bit more tint to it
what do you guys think I mean I just
feel like my skin - very moisturize
versus me having makeup on I don't know
can we talk about this lip stuff it
looks like I was like chapstick on in 10
years I guess that's it neutralizing the
color of my lips but I'm not here for it
I don't like it I'm going to put a
lipstick on top and just see what
happens this is a Birkin suede I'm going
to guess it neutralizes the color of
your lips that kind of weird and I don't
think it plumped my lips at all so I
think that that pot is eight and I think
it's a little gimmicky you know I do
this videos we can say the word gimmicky
a lot and I only got to say it one so
far we don't in the comments what you
think about the glossy or perfecting a
skin tint also I mean I will say I don't
think it like most shimmery or doing
things make your pores look bigger I
don't think this made map course look
bigger I feel like my pores is almost
the same next up we're going to try out
a cool product now these are eyeliner
stickers I got these off Etsy
instructions very important it says
always best to start with simple makeup
it's saying don't mess up your eyeshadow
and do it on a bare eye oh it's like
kind of clear okay the problem is it's
way too big for my eyeball we're still
gonna try the only thing is I think the
liner would be a little thick at this
part so I'm just going to do it a little
thinner down there we're going to use my
NYC liquid liner it doesn't want to
stick to my eye very well which
frightens me a little bit all right guys
Peyton
all right I did it
and let's see oh my god get this away
from me right now that was terrible just
like that was gimmicky
all right cool we're going to try to do
better over here with it lowered like
that was a way better application second
try is the wind I feel it this time I'm
going to try with gel liner because I
feel like it's not as liquidy all right
that was like took me two seconds to
fill in nicely shall I pull it all it
was perfect but I mean not the world's
best wing liner but oh my god I think I
just did a really bad job at applying
the sticker the first time these kind of
work it kind of work if you guys want to
see the instructions for after we're
done there they are
alright next what I have is a brown
marker dong dong min brown marker what
in the world I just read I got the shade
of gray brown and it looks like this oh
cool the cap is what when the tarnation
you guys seeing this it's like a spoolie
with a little wiener sticking up edge
essential brow gel and forshay is
designed to match all hair colors
without fading tame unruly brows I think
this is supposed to have a triangular
tip on it and I think mines broken on
line that has a triangular tip do I have
bad luck I bought this product to myself
it wasn't sent to me cool I bought a
broken one it supposed to have a sponge
tip so now I can't properly try it out I
think you're supposed to be like and
drawing your brows and then fill them in
I'm just kind of annoyed that this
coming product wasn't that affordable
and I that I got awfully a Sephora site
a while ago a few months ago and it's no
longer for sale on there oh fail I don't
even get to try it out line
next we're going to try out let's try
out this this is the fun one
I got this off Amazon this is a pickle
lip balm poker up it sounds disgusting
we're going to find out if it is just
like a gag gift that I bought myself
twist break the silk
it doesn't smell like pickles but it's
like faintly green it doesn't like much
of it anything it doesn't taste like
pickles at all it tastes like a public
bathrooms air freshener it literally
tastes like public bathrooms ever it
smells kind of like it tuna this all a
pickle I was really hoping this was
going to be a pickle moment it's really
take a suckled on an air freshener okay
mmm I'm not here for it girl
not for me okay so moving right along
our next product is a homemade
highlighter that I got Etsy this is
seeds makeup shot mineral makeup
handmade this product was handmade in
England and if you can kind of tell
there's like three shades
skyrest watcher Ruthie it says it's
holographic ooh oh it looks kind of cool
it looks Oh that turned out so cool that
literally went from like all white to
blue pink and yellow it's green you kind
of see the lights are like screwing it
up a little bit but that turned out way
closer than I thought the only thing is
these are chunky glitter but let's see
what it looks like on my face I think I
just roll it all around we're getting an
a load of Fallout it's so cool it's
really really pigmented and it's it
comes up arid Essen I wouldn't say
holographic I would say Eric Destin
highlighter this is really cool and um I
look like a little space alien right now
but I'm kind of here for it thought it
was gonna suck I'm not gonna lie I'm
sorry I did but it doesn't really I'm
going to prove
product maybe not used so much I'm just
learning as I go here but I thought it
was cool all right next up we had a cool
product we have a lip mineral precious
metals their glitter lip sticks and I'm
just excited to see what they come out
on the lips I gotta hit her beneath
fitters and there were 16 bucks for a
pack of 3 it's just an all-around white
tube can I see that sparkle lots of dust
comes out of this area oh cool I
literally saw the mirror when I did that
with my hot breath all right it's
literally fog okay so oddly enough is
not at all what I thought it was just
literally
a gimmick and a sandal because it's a
one coat of glitter on a brown lipstick
and pretend like you've got to get some
glitter lips girl Urban Outfitters you
played me so uncool watch the other one
is a pretty lipstick shade like the
brown one is just brown lipstick and
then the pink one is going to be yeah
just pink lipstick well I look a little
cuckoo this is not how I normally do my
makeup if you're new to my channel or is
it the comment sessions are like yes it
is she's crazy get out of here but um oh
man that was fun we definitely like
cracked the case with some things the
only thing I kind of liked was the
highlighter if you use a little bit of
it I think it's a really cool moment it
definitely does what it says it does
which is what's important the skin tone
I didn't hate I felt like it didn't get
that much pigmentation but I also felt
like it get made the skin really soft
and moisturize and it did not enhance
the pores and I also liked the mood
gloss rest of it was like oh yeah this
one looking like these days well that's
a fitness video guys I hope you enjoyed
me making a fool of myself out of makeup
when we crack the case on a couple weird
makeup products and I hope you got a
little bit of a laugh out of this video
