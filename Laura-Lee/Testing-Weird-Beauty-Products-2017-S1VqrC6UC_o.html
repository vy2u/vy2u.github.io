card you hand me the vibrating thing out
living room and the little Rolly thing
out of the bathroom yeah it's scary so
this is an interesting item it is a
little toil total it's a tool that
vibrates and it has little needles you
see those little needles on my Garf it
look so scary trust the power button and
it makes it vibrate I'm so scared it
kind of is daddy feeling this is called
a glow Pro it's sold at Nordstrom I'm
going to show you the box so you guys
can see that the before and after it's I
think it's good to help build collagen
and sprinkles we won't be able to see
any specific results today skin firmness
you know natural collagen even if skin
tone younger appearance suggests that
you use it two to three times a week
it's suggested that you go with it not
like crazy all over can't use on your
lips and you can't use it on your
eyelids or you're not supposed to and it
comes with a travel case it comes with a
bottle if you want to spritz it with
alcohol for sanitary purposes and then
it comes with this see under your social
put on your face right after you're done
with it just to help the benefits of the
product I'm not going to apply the serum
today but you're supposed to because I
have so many things to test out you are
so
to go over each area four to ten times
with it I'm gonna show guys like I'm
super weird about putting anything pokey
or too aggressive on my skin like I'm
all about a little bit natural I mean I
do use a retinol but still did I do it
and I come out like blood everywhere I'm
like so scared right now oh my gosh I
feel it I feel it hear that oh it kind
of hurts my forehead I don't like it on
my forehead it makes me really nervous
you can see like a little like for a
brief second you can take the little
moments on my forehead little markings
oh yeah I'm not like obsessed with this
thing it's freaking me out man so
basically it is very uncomfortable in
areas I don't have a lot of fatty like
the cheeks it doesn't hurt and all this
because there's like a lot of fatty
tissue but the forehead is like just
hard and so any surface it presses
against it kind of hurts and it honestly
it freaks me out a little bit do you see
the redness coming through oh I have
seen a lot of estheticians and people
who are really into skincare use these
it seems a little bit gimmicky and I'm
probably going to say the word gimmicky
a lot in this video so let's just make a
drinking game of it every time I know or
gimmicky you got a drink I mean it could
work it's not painful enough to scare me
any using it you see or rubber for EM
yeah it could work I kind of sort of
thing I want to keep using it for a
month straight you know like two times a
week for a month straight and see what
happens
what do you guys think how many of you
guys tried this tell me tell me your
thoughts tell me if you have any results
that's the name of it maybe you'll get
rid of some of my wrinkles on the
forehead I don't know oh it's okay I'm
going to go ahead and try out the hair I
don't next just keep the video
interesting I'm going to brush it hard
so is what I have on deck today is the
curl me and as you see there's like a
million little tops of hair brushes here
and what you're supposed to do now you
may have already seen this on Instagram
what is going to do is
take a little handle and pop the thing
in there blow-dry it in your hair and
then you leave this in your hair and
then once the hair is cool you can take
it out if you have this luscious
beautiful curls oh you also put a clip
around it as well as you guys want my
tongue clicking my tongue clicking is a
great way to explain taste you want a
little view of the result since it's the
end up looking like this I somehow doubt
I'm going to be looking like this but it
looks like she's got two on top and two
on each side
we'll see if I can do this by myself I'm
not that good at round brushing my hair
though with a blow dryer I don't know
how good I'm going to be at doing this
by the way it also comes with this brush
too like part your hair this is my fancy
smancy dice and blow dryer that is
powerful like practicing lightning if i
cool got it
boom babies could be the bomb diggity
what does this work y'all what do you
think I don't know how's that I'm doing
anything rolling these suckers up but it
feels like tight you know what do I look
like a packing girl overall review if
you're not good at round brushing your
hair and really getting it tight and
there you're probably going to struggle
with these things right here that's like
key component of these things need metal
on these do get super hot so do be
careful so I can definitely see how it
could curl your hair and they give you a
lot because I still have a lot left over
but if you have super long hair you'll
probably have to do half your head take
them out and do the other half and
something I didn't realize that small
ones and big ones so while these are
pulling off I'm going to test out the I
respect for you and this is the
illuminating eye massager younger and
refreshed looking eyes helps reduce
puffiness bags and our circle smooth the
appearance of crow's feet fine lines and
wrinkles rejuvenates so it looks like
this it looks like a little vocal
effects point of me you hear that you
see that oh hi you strange old creature
and turned it down and you can turn it
back up if you want to this one's pink
eye thing to have in different colors so
Sephora says eight speeds waterproof
this is really turn smelling sex away
maybe you care about your eye like this
does it I'm confused
alright for once I'm going to read the
directions peeps all right party people
I did my expense
research it's really hard to turn on it
hurts my hand and you're supposed to
adjust first adjust how strong you want
it and then you just work it from inner
to outer I just like this and I read the
reviews on sephora.com and they are
mixed some people say it did absolutely
nothing and they returned it and some
people say that this for you our iris
tool right here reduce the puffiness and
it was noticeable is $140 $140 people
kind of considering using this but my
god like I pulled out all these gadgets
at night and used so like I know I got
half of it doesn't hurt my eye is
comfortable to do to use it's expensive
it seems a little bit gimmicky take a
drink my hair is done I'm going to take
it on these I wanted to say it lightly
you know remove it out of these foot
there we go my hair is a little bit wavy
before oh no that came from the curler
Wow look at that
ow yeah but like it's weird because I
all my curls are at the bottom wait to
take this one out up front super
annoying oh ouch ouch ouch ouch that is
fabulous
seriously though we haven't touched
bottom of that one honey uncomfortable
but you know that's just a part of life
ow ah oh there goes there goes my hair
definitely has like that
lift oh yeah I mean yeah that worked
like a lot of hair happening right now I
mean look at that overall that I'm not I
don't hate that I mean you know I would
have to style this a little more but and
I would have to get better around
brushing my hair it gave you the volume
it said it would give you so I say it
works I just say it's a little difficult
to work with now let's jump into a few
as a makeup product I'm actually I'm
going to clip this hair other thing the
first audit product we had it to cover
FX custom blot drop Caesar blotting
sheets and liquid form so there's
supposed to be an oil controlled product
I just said oil does that make you guys
happy and sustain all so basically says
online that you can use it along you use
it your moisturizer
you can use it in your foundation on top
of your foundation suppose you can use
it however you want to use it almost
like a stick whip consistency feels
thicker than just an average serum but I
really want to do is mix this in one of
my liquidy foundation like see there
mm-hmm I'm just going to mix it together
the foundations texture is changing a
little bit you see that how it's like
separating and lean china strange skins
like what are you doing to me today and
take my morphe white face brush and
blend out the foundation oh this is
strange the foundation feels a little
weird it almost feels a little more
tacky and this is the makeup forever and
I will say just Ralph's about the
foundation is 100 in math mostly is can
you tell like it almost looks like I
have a powder on that's super matte I
just applied this foundation it's
normally still wet and not only this
Make Up For Ever foundation doesn't have
just like a flat ah solid matte finish
like this that is cool it's like my
foundation kind of dried way quicker and
it made the foundation like super matte
a blot some of this maybe even on a
Beauty Blender and it just like
mattifies everything very interesting
product I don't hate it it's on personal
preference of course I'm not mad about
it right and for my fifth it's product
I'm gonna be testing out this quite
strange is so glossy eyes have kind of
came into a bit of a trend lately and I
actually love the look what I have is I
vinyl these are like eye markers for
milks makeup and they're called eye
vinyl have two shades places to do is
like color across your eyes with eyes
with these and have this cool look it
has a sponge applicator and you just
crank it up and there it is I'm a little
nervous okay
not every day I put like a black and
blue substance on my eye I'm just
pushing around the product oh my god
there's the only time I dead serious I
see this being like a practical thing to
wear is in an editorial photo shoot it's
very even in color
not creasing it's not running down my
face yet it feels just as disgusting as
it looks
next I'm going to go ahead just because
we're here we're having a great time
we're having fun today I'm going to try
the peachy one you see you're poking
through is clear clear gloss the eyes
party people this is how you can even
take your finger I mean really and just
wow look at that one steps glossy eye
look I mean seriously just like boom
weii that's pretty if you're into the
wet eye trend I mean this is it this is
it in a stick I will spend my ISIL heavy
but they don't feel like they're not
sticking with you touches very like the
way I look in general would you try it
would you wear it out comment your
thoughts on that thank you guys for
