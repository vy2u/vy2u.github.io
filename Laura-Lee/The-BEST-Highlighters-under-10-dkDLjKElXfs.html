I'm going to drive an 18-wheeler today
hey hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be the best
highlighters under $10 so it doesn't
break your bank get out I'm gonna fire
everyone on my staff
meaning Tom today's video is going to be
my top highlighters under $10
they are amazing you need them in your
life and they will not break your bank
account okay people you will still have
funds for groceries fast food at
McDonald's and have these highlights in
your life so we're going to talk about a
bunch today actually I'm 9 I really
wanted to choose you title it top 10
highlighters under $10 but now I have 9
is just not going to flow and work out
also if you haven't subscribed to my
channel I'm just gonna assume this is
your first video of mine and that's why
you haven't clicked the button we're
gonna get this first highlight I wanna
mention to you guys is my mac cosmetics
this one is called oh darling just
kidding I know this one cost an arm and
a leg and your child soul so not what
we're talking about today but the first
time I oughta mention to you guys is by
wet and wild and it is quite affordable
so I've heard mixed reviews on this one
and my overall official opinion on
YouTube is that is amazing highlighter
so I love it so much because yes it has
pinkies in it but because of that I
think it makes it for an amazing blush
topper slash highlighter you can run
your brush along this edge of it and you
get the nice highlight shade which is a
light little bit of a rosy color and
then you can rub it across all of it and
you get more of a pinky toned down color
do you see that and it makes for a
beautiful highlight as well as a blush
topper so it's kind of like a two-in-one
deal you get more than one out of this
and not to mention the dang thing is the
size of my head okay
and you are not paying much for it these
are a little bit powdery look but I like
to just soak everything with mac fix+
spray and it
turn things that are a little bit chalky
and powdery into it just melts it into
your skin that way you look glowy
moisturized and not like a streak of
powder across your face do you see what
I'm saying you're picking up what I'm
putting down
let's move on the next highlight I want
to recommend to you guys and it's one
that I have mentioned already in a
previous video very previous like a
couple videos back it is to make it
revolution this is their shimmer brick
radiant and I really love this one this
is more of a bronzey highlight if you
tap into the bronze but if like I like
to do just tap into the other colors and
it's more of a golden highlight until
you get down here and then you see how
it turns a little bit more bronzy now
I'm not going to be too dead whore whore
not gonna be the dead whore I'm not
going to be the dead horse and go on and
on about this because I just talked
about it so much in a previous video but
I do love it I think it's worth your
dolla dolla bill yo and it's really
pretty again this is another one that's
super like chalky powdery but if you
melt it down complete perfection move
and you're like Laura there any old that
aren't chalky powdery yes there is and
this one has been to hell and back and
survived and is still resting on my
cheekbone I'm actually wearing this
today I don't know why I said that
anyways this one is called spoon back
color pop as most you know I believe
these either cost six or eight dollars I
don't know surround that it's under $10
as I know and as you can see it is not
supposed to look like this but it does
and this is my favorite out of all of
their highlights that they have this is
literally so pretty that it pains me I
wear this one very often if you follow
me on Instagram I post my makeup looks
and I tell you all the makeup that I'm
wearing that day and spoon is quite
often incorporated I love this one it's
such a oh no she's just falling apart in
there it's such a random name for a
highlight and I do have to be very
careful with her maybe I'll just go out
and get fancy and buy another one
because it is so affordable I love that
 the next one I want to recommend to
you guys actually comes in this Rimmel
little quad so you have like a bronzer
that's way too dark for me a blush the
looks like
orgasm by NARS and then I rarely talk
about the highlight in it however I've
mentioned this palette 19 times on my
channel so here I am beating a dead
whore in just getting hoarse again but
the highlight in it and these are not
too chalky
mm-hmm no it's a very pretty pearly
color I think this would look flawless
on multiple skin tones because it is a
pearly shade but it's one of the deeper
pearly shades it's not nearly as
pigmented as the color pop one the color
pop ones are just crazy they're crazy
they're doing crazy business over there
okay people I don't even know what
they're putting in their makeup but is
good give me more of it
not like intensely pigmented but I
actually love the shade of it it's nice
and maybe not everybody likes such a
bold highlight I'm just kidding
everybody loves it bold I like everybody
all right the next one a subscriber sent
to me because I'm solo on this channel
goes the mega club I went I wanted it so
bad and I only went to 20 CVS and
Walgreens and yeah I have yet to still
be able to get home every time I try to
they're sold out so I had a sweet
subscriber when I had a peel box I don't
have it anymore I moved but whenever I
had it this was in it and it was just so
kind I was really excited about it
anywho it looks like this this one is
called coming up a canapé and it is a
very beautiful rose gold color mind you
these are so so cute if you like pure
silk this one is the deeper one of them
and I think it looks beautiful just
beautiful and for wet and wild prices
the actual quality of the powder is
crazy good I adore this if you can get
if you can find them get every single
one of them don't the drugstore play you
you get every single one of them you
don't leave any for the girl behind you
you don't you just take them all and you
buy them all selfish the next one I want
to mention is on borderline 11 dollars
at Target but we all know Target charges
a little bit more but if you go to
Walmart or so you can get it for like 10
bucks this one is by Physicians Formula
they're always coming up with some funky
package anything
that this room is supposed to be pearls
but it mounts me little pimples and
makes me want to like throw up but the
actual products really nice this is
called beige pearl so once you get into
it it's actually more of a beige color
it looks like it's going to be like this
white color but once you get on into it
like I have it's almost like a little
bit of a beige powder it's a very pretty
highlight if you have a deeper skin tone
and you still like the whitish light
highlights and want something look good
on you I recommend this because it is
still at a very light highlight but it
has that beige undertone to it it's very
pretty on the skin and position formula
is cruelty free and organic I believe I
might be making that last part up but
they are cruelty free I just want to say
that my makeup is absolutely just
absolutely beautiful today few minutes
joy will comment down below narcissus
right the next one is a cream one from
the drugstore this one is by flower
beauty which is Drew Barrymore's makeup
lanzhou nice app there's a little trivia
for you this is a cream highlight come
on now come on you know you see that and
you know it's taking your breath away
this one's called glisten up so they I
think she has a few different shades
this is the one only one that I have of
these they are crazy pigmented and I'm
going to tell you a little trick if you
want like your highlight to show it like
this and your Instagram pictures or
whatever your pictures first use a flash
second apply a cream I like like this
and then just blend it out with your
finger and then stick a powder highlight
right on top of it well you will be
moving in for better get your sunglasses
out they won't be ready for you I don't
know who they are but whoever's in your
feed whoever whoever stalking your feet
that day the next one is another one by
color pop and I think this one is
fabulous just fabulous for people with a
lighter skin toned and I can't wear this
one right now because I have a little
bit of a tan whenever I don't like in
the wintertime I can pull this one off a
little bit easier but I do have to go
light hate it with it this one it
reminds me a lot of pearl by Becca
cosmetics it's pretty much a dupe for it
and it is so pretty but it is so light
like it's white a highlighter so like I
said if you have a lighter skin tone
pearl by colour-pop I'm just making up
stuff fanny pack by colour-pop is where
that the next one I have another one by
color pop I know I'm really just like
color pop color pop color pop but you
know they make good stuff for a low
price and you can't beat it with a stick
this one is electric slide mmm make sure
you screw to the lid on these real tight
because if you don't ever night it will
become a drop of prune and will land in
your garbage can this one is amazing if
you want to go for a golden bronze look
and especially if you have medium to
deeper skin tone I love this one used as
an eyeshadow base as well because it's
incredibly creamy hi hello hi gold and
again if you want your highlight to pop
and you're going for a golden highlight
that day you would apply this you can
wear it alone totally absolutely but if
you want it to it to really pop you
could wear this and then put a golden
highlight powder or golden eyeshadow on
top of it
well they will see you coming a mile
away it's so pretty though and then last
but certainly not least mmm is the oldie
but a goodie I've been mentioning this
stuff on my youtube channel since I kind
of started the YouTube channel I mean
like three years ago a little over three
years ago my goodness what is all this
does anyways these are the shimmer
facial whips by elf they cost $1 so you
know they're very worthy in price but
this one is Lila petal eyelet petal is
my favorite shade elf makes of anything
so these actually whenever you really
get into blending them out they turn
into a little bit of a powder but they
are thick once you get started so they
might move around your blush or
something so I remember mend a tapping
motion versus a rubbing motion with
these on your skin that way you don't
mess up your other makeup that you've
already applied to your skin but as you
can see it is incredibly beautiful very
pigmented very popping just like
highlight of the century right here for
a dollar probably the most you can get
out of a dollar right here the best
dollar spent just trying to keep it
with you guys so anyways that is it for
this video guys thank you so much for
watching be sure and subscribe to my
channel for more craziness happening cuz
clearly if you haven't figured out that
I'm a crazy person yet that means you
are just getting started on my channel I
love you guys hope this video was
helpful and I'll catch you all in my
next video bye
