special guest here with me today don't
you think so I can't believe I've never
showed him on my channel like this
channel before but this is my husband
kit out this is ty mami guys are
probably right now saying wait she's
married um we'll get into that in the
video we're gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A and say hey
hey dad's gonna be super shine this
video and reserved but just know he's
not as always like that he's warming up
to the camera world and that's part of
the reason he hasn't been on my channel
yet just because he's just not used to
being on camera it's weird for him I'm
like talking boy yeah it's a little
weird in it so yeah we're gonna answer
the questions you guys I think we got
how many Lake almost 500 questions
whether really but a lot of raping so
we're just gonna get started and I hope
you guys enjoy her I'm the awkward one
how did we meet well we met in action
thought I was taking this wait what's
how long but you need to tell the truth
okay yeah when I asked for lunch money
yes again we met the first time in high
school through an acquaintance a mutual
friend Laura was I guess a little short
on lunch my Oh early didn't know him but
I asked apparently my friend was like
hey my friend here doesn't have lunch
money can you give her some and Tyler so
I gave her some literally doesn't even
know me and that's like how you are
though I don't think you ever pay me
back though so and that's how we met and
we didn't talk to each other again until
senior year pretty much that was in
tenth grade how long have you guys been
together mmm what is it like seven years
now seven
in February of 2008 yes but do you guys
argue about the most hmm yeah that's
it's up there food problem I would say
we probably argue a lot about how much
each one of us works yeah we argue a lot
like because he's always at work and I'm
always doing stuff with YouTube so
between the two of us it's like never
ending for either of us
what is his career I work for Amazon
we're not gonna say what he does though
just for our safety and privacy a little
bit have you ever seen Pet Detective
where Jim Carrey delivers the Amazon
package delivers a package that's what I
do what at what age did you meet um so I
guess that would be the lunch money
incident I was 16 you were 16 here was
that that was two times I'm getting
ready to school your brother so you're
15 yeah started 10th grade at 15 so I
was 16 only the 15 and 16 which makes
you like 18 you know what why did we
move to California so I did a whole blog
on this if you want to wash it will give
you like a really in-depth version of
this answer but we moved here because of
his job but his job let us pick three
places in the United States that we
wanted to move and three regions three
regions north east south west so we
picked California because we I take you
to very seriously and I wasn't I have my
30,000 or 20,000 subscribers when we
moved out here no I had like 10,000 not
very well but I just I cared so much
about my channel what I was doing with
it I was like I'm gonna do great things
with YouTube
let's head close to Li that way I can
grow with YouTube and have opportunities
and he was I am me but is one weird fact
about each other PS I love you Eleni
he picks his toenails you pick your
toenails off oh so we call each other
out now haha one weird thing that Laura
does it kind of involves me so it's kind
of gross but she loves to try to pop
zits on me yeah what does he think about
you doing YouTube and having all that
makeup Oh try calming out oh he's cool I
guess
you started it from the ground it's like
her own business that she does out of
our bedroom art so it used to be our
bedroom that's he used to not be as much
fun back then because we had studio
lights he was so nice about it though
basically we had a bed in my beauty
burger yeah it was that's all we could
do we had one bedroom yeah I actually
got like a lot a lot a lot of people
asking me what does he think about the
makeup you have what does he think about
you doing YouTube and I feel like you
have so much makeup I did but I feel
like a lot of people asked that question
not everyone but I believe some people
it was just asked so much that people
were like does he approve or you know
I'm just wondering it's not like that in
our relationship you know like you can
have as much as you want because it's
your job what's the what's your favorite
thing to do together love to eat honest
we do whatever will you guys ever do uh
my husband does my makeup challenge I
New Year's you don't do mine no I read
that again my husband does my makeup so
I do yours okay will we ever do that I
would do that okay I would it would look
beautiful probably better than what you
do okay thumbs up this video if you guys
want to see that he is a lot less hyper
than you for balance I'm probably just
as hyper sir you just don't see it on
the camera cuz I don't really like being
on camera like just weird come out it's
weird
oh no I gotta get used to being on the
camera but I might be more hyper than no
way now
a little bit more reserved than me what
do you guys love most about each other
what is the one thing that annoys you
the other person does
so first what do we love most about each
other that's easy for me to answer
teller is like the least judgmental
person in the world
a homeless man like a gun could walk up
to him and tell her would be like honey
he just found the gun hey he's a sweet
guy like we're gonna have a little for
dinner he like whenever you meet tell
her you're a blank slate to him no
matter what you're wearing what you look
like what race you are no judgment and
you have like taught me to be more that
way one thing I guess I love about
Laura's her ambition yeah but I do love
its her ambition like with with things
like this like YouTube like she once she
puts her heart and there's something
she's full force into it she doesn't let
go
she guys have no idea how many late
nights she has doing things for you I
her ambition is through the roof yeah
lipstick oh baby tell mommy oh
it was one thing that annoys you ah
annoys me about you you hate declaiming
you leave your pig toenails everywhere
um why are we always I feel like we
revert back to pick toenails every time
I'm sorry but they're everywhere and it
grosses me out and in the weed I intend
to clean them up sometimes I forget what
annoys me about you Oh like it doesn't
really like super annoy me when when
you're telling me like a story or
something about how you feel you always
end it with you I know right I mean no
you know what I mean you know I mean you
know I mean what is his favorite makeup
look on you it do they have names I'm
fears he doesn't know no I don't have
names I don't understand
is he supportive oh hell naw okay yes he
is very very very supportive who mrs.
Alabama more so for those of you don't
know we live in California but we lived
our whole life in Alabama we haven't
even been California we've been here a
year now so who misses Alabama more I
haven't been home since we moved out
here so probably me you've been home why
isn't your being here and came here but
my parents aren't Alabama all right I
guess you then how long have you been
married for a month what's on our
marriage date I think it was May 19 Hey
schizos whites are in their own are you
planning on having any kids oh you take
that one sweetheart I don't want kids
I've never wanted kids I've never had
like this big urge to be a mother I know
a lot of women do it's never been there
for me
I'm very openly I've discussed this with
Ty like I tell hell even before yeah
Mary knows I look I don't want kids I've
never wanted kids
I even had people be really rude to me
about and be like oh you're put on this
planet to reproduce like that's what
you're here for so but my own mother is
like good you don't want to have kids
don't be having those babies my mom will
tell you like it is she's like don't
have kids you know when kids don't have
kids so she says she makes it clear when
we walked into this marriage right but I
did as well that one day I feel like we
should have a kid so we don't know one
day but I did tell her that I I didn't
marry the idea of having a kid I married
her so if we do it happens if we don't
it doesn't happen we're playing it by
ear she's she's trying to conquer the
world right now we're both trying to
conquer the world right now
what's one food that you guys eat a lot
and it reminds you of each other Jersey
Mike's Subs my Roseanne we would just go
drink beer and eat wings
if I eat ramen noodles that
I think of you yeah what's your favorite
memory together so far I'm gonna say
besides the wedding day
something something besides the wedding
day um my favorite memory is whenever we
were young like 18 he had a Jeep and I
sat in his lap and would drag the
steering wheel and he would press the
gas pedals and we would drive around
Alabama and it was incredibly dangerous
and stupid illegal and super illegal but
it was so much fun
we would do it in like 3:00 in the
morning though and in Alabama like no
one's on the road just to be fair so my
favorite memory is all the visits that
we had between us whenever I lived in
Auburn yeah like we we spent he's five
days apart so he went to college and he
lived a little over an hour away from me
so we did the long-distance thing for
like two and a half years or was it
three years we spent the week days apart
from each other cuz she worked of course
and I went to school during the week and
so all we had was the weekends and a lot
of times I had to work on the weekends
because I had a part-time job so it had
one day a week we would get yeah we
would get one day a week by the time
that we spent with each other during
that one to two days that weekend like
that's probably my best memory wonderful
wasn't that you that look nervous oh my
god whenever he's nervous he starts
calling me Laura
Laura I was super nervous also throw in
there because a lot of you guys ask how
he proposed and I just want to say that
I requested that if he ever asked for my
hand in marriage to do it in the most
simple way with just the two of us and
this is what I get
we're on a cruise ship in the Bahamas
Park sunset I have diarrhea
of course we get all dressed up with
looking nice so I was not like a nice
well I can't hope you had diarrhea
he's like come with me and I had like a
filling but I wasn't sure and I'm like
oh hi
your diarrhea diesel we're like out on
the edge of the deck and he's like going
behind we're grabbing this weird
umbrella and I'm like put that back
that's not our like I'm literally
yelling at him don't take someone's
umbrella that's not right and he's like
just shut up you know and all of a
sudden rose petals start raining down
from the top of the ship and a
photographer like literally literally
comes out and the whole entire cruise
ship is lined up nothing yes like every
guest on the cruise ship was lined up
and Tyler's like down on one knee and
it's the mounts prophet Brigham birds
didn't start fluttering on your pocket
yeah and so like people there's a
photographer too in like in my face in
the sunset wedding in the Bahamas I
thought it was nice it was so nice and I
said yes
he's crankier in the morning um what is
your wedding dress look like Prince's
formal or sexy no it was is pretty basic
Dana and asked can he run and scream
like a raptor what's the most annoying
thing about Laura hmm
most annoying thing about Laura Laura
what is that I find eyelashes everywhere
if you had to choose between your
husband and pizza which would you choose
pizza
who says sorry first she forces me
sometimes say sorry
he's the hard-headed one the
relationship your hubby or makeup you
often God
throw it all away right now I'll rip
your chin hair out what things you do to
annoy each other that how do you know
he's the one okay so it was so weird but
like we were like eating fast food
before we got married not like the day
of like the day before you didn't know
before this let me spend seven years
take you to figure out I was the one you
were I was just like talking about a
relationship very nonchalantly and I was
like you know we waited so long to get
married but I know that it's gonna be
good because in that you're the one
because you know I pictured my life in a
million different ways but you were
always in it look and that's so cheesy
but confirmed it to me whenever you can
imagine your life and you can't imagine
it without that person in it like
there's just no way you're like what
you're saying you know does my career
and makeup affect my relationship um
okay no I mean it's your job fix your
car alarm okay what is you guys is
opinion on sex before marriage we didn't
wait till marriage and we turned out
okay you like a long before like I gotta
have sex before high school
I gotta have sex before I'm this age
like none of that crap matters that's
gonna affect you and no one else ever
get in bad fights I would say no why you
probably been a long time
since we've had like a drop-down fight
yeah like we would hide silently Baker
Eddy yeah woman fights like normal
couples no I mean like when was last
time we had I don't know I don't know
walls out honestly don't know what's his
name my name is dollar gosh I'm good to
meet you what's your favorite movie both
a cincher when nature calls mom but I
think I like Django the mouse who does
more chores Oh break your finger looking
at my hair cell wrong my hair your head
loose so like look at the viewfinder the
whole time look right here
oh I'm still looking hope you guys
enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A we answered some of
your questions we'll be sure to do
another one and answer more questions
for you guys and maybe do some challenge
