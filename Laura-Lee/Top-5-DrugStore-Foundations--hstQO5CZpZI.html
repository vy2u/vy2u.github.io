nevermind I thought I had a crack in my
lens but it's the reflection of my
lighting hey guys and welcome to my
channel today's video is going to be my
top 5 favorite drugstore foundations
I've done this video before I did it a
long time ago but as we know drug stores
evolve and they're coming out with all
kinds of great new products so I just
looked around and I'm like there's a lot
of great drugstore foundations that I
love that I feel like I needed to talk
about a little bit more we need to have
a conversation I'm feeling so super
vampy today like I feel like I could
possibly be a vampire No so I have a lot
of great products to talk to you guys
about and just to let you know the
foundations that we're gonna talk about
today are for combination only dry skin
acne I mean whatever you got I have a
good foundation for it because I find
that my skin is pretty much combination
skin throughout the year besides the
wintertime in winter time it's just it's
dry I mean there's nothing else to it
throughout the year my forehead right
here likes to get extremely greasy
especially whenever getting nervous or
hot it's just it looks like a puddle of
wetness and it is quite unattractive so
I've got good foundations for you know
stuff like that it's not just for our
skin but anyways if you want to chitchat
drugstore foundations with me just keep
watching the first two are both by
Maybelline is apparently it is the matte
poreless at me and then as well as the
dewy smooth love those these foundations
for two different reasons so we'll talk
about my favorite one to begin with this
is my favorite out of all the drugstore
foundations right now Maybelline did an
awesome job when creating this
foundation
I love the formula I love the formula
and both of them I just think whatever
they did to make this not just a matte
matte and poreless part but just the
medium cover she covers just so perfect
and when I put it on my skin it's just
everything it's not too heavy coverage
but then it's not too thin and it's not
too powdery and it's not too liquidy
it's just everything in the middle so
it's kind of like everything that I look
for in a foundation right in this little
drug store bottle and I know
joso foundations prices are going whoop
right up and I don't understand that was
like 17 18 dollars for a drugstore
foundation hello people
cool it but this one I mean this one
runs like 7 or 8 bucks so well in the
United States at 7 or 8 bucks my cat is
going in and out the door if I closed
the door she's gonna be y'all the whole
entire time people comment all the time
asking me do I have ghosts I probably do
you guys are wondering this shade that I
wear in both of these is 220 which is
natural beige overall if you're just
like I don't know what drugstore
foundation I want to pick out next if
you have oily skin and you are just
struggling with that in your foundation
definitely give this one a try now I
wanted to talk about these kind of
together because it's the same thing I
love the consistency of the formula I
love the way it sits on the skin the
same thing but if you have dry skin give
this one a try sometimes I don't like my
face to be matte and with this
foundation I think if you have oily skin
your face isn't gonna be matte it's just
gonna be normal looking and with this
one if you have dry skin again I don't
think you're gonna have like a really
new e skin I think it's just gonna be
normal skin looking I don't necessarily
recommend this one if you have oily skin
though because it definitely does not
have any mattifying power within it but
the formula is amazing the coverage it's
just perfect just an FYI though the dewy
one does have sunscreen in it so if
you're gonna be doing a lot of picture
taking I recommend going with the matte
friend right back there brother and
sister so cute the next time they should
I want to talk about is one that you
guys recommend it to me I put a picture
of my foundation jour on Instagram you
guys for recommending foundations I
needed to try next
and you guys told me to try in the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte about a
boom but I being here she is I did give
it a try I looked at the packaging and I
just knew this was gonna be like one of
those silicone base foundations I don't
like to read up on products I like to
just dive right in and try them out that
I think that's part of being a beauty
blogger just testing out things for
yourself getting a good opinion then
going in and doing some factual reading
on it the reason I hadn't gotten it
right when it came out is because I was
just turned off by the packaging it's
just it's very
schoolin is very plain it's cheap
looking so I thought the foundation was
gonna be a little bit like I actually
tried it I did indeed like it like a lot
it just wasn't like wowed by the
packaging and let me tell you something
if a company is watching packaging sales
market it honey but that being said the
foundation is nothing like the package
perceives it to be I perceived it to be
almost like silicon base just like super
matte it's really not that matte but it
does help with all control and the thing
that I like about this foundation the
most is that I noticed that it laughed
on my skin for a really long time it
doesn't really get patchy it just kind
of smoothly laughs on my skin and I'm
very happy with that so that is this
little foundation strong point in my
opinion I think it would be great with
dry or oily skin because like I said
it's not that matte that where if you
have dry skin is so I'm gonna make you
look like overly dry I'm in shade 108
caramel beige and this one and that is
just a touch too dark for me but summer
times come in and we're gonna get there
more thing that I really like about this
foundation is that it is buildable so
you can get that lightweight coverage or
you can just build it up and get heavy
coverage without getting too cakey
because I know is it is a liquid
foundation and it is a little bit thin
so you just don't feel too heavy wearing
it oh yeah okay so the next one when to
come out really isn't that new but it's
not that old it's it's kind of medium
CoverGirl's Ready Set gorgeous I am in
shade 220 I try to cover the shades in
the beginning but I forget because I'm
like oh great things about this
foundation one I lost my train of
thought number one is definitely that
this foundation is an old free
foundation I don't care even if you have
dry skin I just don't like old
foundations I just feel heavy and gross
when I wear them and I know I say the
word all wrong and I'm probably gonna
get like 15 comments that people telling
me they like the way I say it or they
hate the way I say it
opinions so thank you for those who like
the way I say oh I like to make up words
and say them how I want to feel like
this is a great everyday foundation
because again it does last for a long
time but it's also not a matte
foundation nor is it a shine dewy
foundation so it's right in between that
happy medium foundation
right for everyday medium coverage the
lasting power isn't it strong suit but I
don't have a problem with it fading away
the main thing is your complexion kind
of shines through this foundation so you
don't look like you're wearing too much
makeup work school you know the huge you
don't want to look cake face but then
you don't want to look like you're not
wearing any makeup ball you want to like
you put a little bit of effort in check
out the Ready Set gorgeous by covergirl
lastly I haven't heard a lot about this
foundation in the YouTube world which is
quite a big world this is the NYX HD
studio photogenic foundation I'm in
shade natural beige 106 I like a lot of
things about this foundation there are
just a few cons as well as there's a lot
of pros so we're gonna talk both this
foundation I figured I mentioned it last
because I do truly like these better
than this one but I do still like this
foundation so I wanted to recommend it
to you guys things that I like about
this foundation is another good everyday
foundation it's not heavy coverage it's
a good medium coverage foundation it's
really easy to blend out if you feel
like your skin just gets patchy and the
foundations don't blend out well on it
you should maybe give this one a try
because it blends out really well the
foundation is pretty lightweight on your
skin so it's not one of those heavy
foundations where you feel like you're
wearing a lot of makeup but I will say
that it takes a long time to dry on your
skin and that's a little bit annoying
about it so you know that makeup
whenever you put it on and you just feel
wet for a while you're like oh we're not
a makeup today the foundation overall is
truly lightweight but it just feels wet
on your skin for a little bit too long
like it takes a little bit too long to
set on your skin if that makes any sense
at all
maybe I wish I just had a few more color
options to choose from I've heard a lot
of complaints about people I thought my
color and I'm happy with it but I'm
saying this because I've heard where
people have had trouble finding the
right color they go up a shade it's too
light they go down one shade is just way
too dark they don't have that many
colors to choose from and I just wish I
had a few more like color options I feel
like if you come out with the foundation
it's something people put all over their
face and you should really be dedicated
to that product and maybe
I was 15 to 20 different shades from
your darkest woman to your lightest
woman and that way everybody can wear
that foundation but it is a good
foundation it sets pretty on the skin
but it takes too long to dry it's medium
coverage lasting is pretty medium
especially for the price I mean you get
you're gonna get almost a full day of
makeup not a problem with that blends
out really easy on the skin so there's
lots of good things about the foundation
you just have two pros and cons and see
which works for you
