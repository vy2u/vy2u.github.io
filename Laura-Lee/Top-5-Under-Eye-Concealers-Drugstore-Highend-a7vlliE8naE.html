hey I'll top library and we're just
gonna jump right in with the top 5 under
a concealer Wow
I'm going to start off with this little
drugstore mamma-jamma right here and
funny thing about this one is by the way
this is the maybelline instant age
rewind concealer funny thing about this
one is you guys are the one that told me
to get it mm-hmm I can't remember on a
video or something I was asking about
good concealers and you guys were like
girlfriend you need to get that Adrienne
one so I got it and you guys you're
right it's amazing use this shade light
pill just to brighten up the under-eye
area as well as covering at first I
didn't like the little gushy spongy on
the end of it but I grew to love it I
really did it's very soft filling on the
eye
it probably hoards bacteria but I
haven't experienced any problems with it
at all so I'm going to keep rolling with
it it's a really good medium coverage
concealer it does the perfect job and
concealing my under eye areas I have it
on right now by the way just on the
under eye area I didn't highlight my
face with it I just put it on the under
eye area and as you can see I am bright
and happy under there so it's a good
good good affordable under-eye concealer
I definitely recommend this one to you
guys I'm going to talk about something
that I've gone through like three or
four to to this stuff and unfortunately
it is a little bit on the pricey in this
is NARS creamy radiant concealer and
this little guy right here has rolled
its way around the YouTube world and
back again I have seen probably every
youtuber on YouTube use this at least
once and you know why because it's an
awesome concealer and the only bad thing
about it is its price but I mean it's
NARS NARS normally runs in a higher
price range I think this is $30 so I use
this shade custard and custard could not
be more of a perfect shade for my
skintone I'm a little bit yellowy
undertone and this is a little bit light
for me so it does perfect in covering
and brightening now I will say that if
you have a really dry under eye area
this one is not for you but if you find
that your honor I areas normal or you
put a cream on before you use it it will
work out great for you the coverage is
super heavy it will leave you with a
super flawless finish and it's kind of
strange because this one blends out into
like a powder almost so like I said it's
a little bit dry that's why I say it's
not really good for those dry under-eye
it's a very strange formula but truly
this is this is an amazing concealer I
wouldn't lie to you I've indigestion
Texas one I want to mention to you guys
and this is the Arbutus skin
urban the skin this is the Urban Decay's
Naked skin concealer I'm seeing this
little guy work its way around the
YouTube world as well because it is an
awesome concealer now reminds me a whole
heck of a lot of the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer but I especially love the doe
foot applicator because it makes it so
easy for use now if you do have dry
under eyes I definitely recommend this
one to you I have a little bit of dry
under eye area and um it works really
well for me really notice the creasing
that much and I noticed is pretty heavy
coverage I also like to highlight my
face with this one because it blends out
so soft oh I have
concealer and I'm having a pool and
moosh around too much you get to blend
out I'm done with it I'm not gonna mess
around with it I like concealers that
blend out easy because I'm a woman on
the go I got a lot of videos to film I
got a lot of emails to answer and I
ain't got time to be blending out that
concealer all day long no I definitely
definitely recommend this to you guys I
think it works well with Olay skin or
dry skin no matter what your under eye
area situation is this one's gonna be
good this is the master concealed by
Maybelline and I don't hear a lot of
people talk about this and I'm like
hello we have a gym right here I use
this one in my cream contour and
highlight video and this is a very Timmy
as a very unique concealer because it
feels almost fluffy and that is so weird
it just feels so whipped and light on
the skin it's a weird feeling concealer
coverage is like I mean look at this
right here the coverage is wild wild is
a really bad way to describe the
coverage of something's and let me start
over the coverage is leaning towards
heavy coverage I think it's a little bit
past medium coverage like we're getting
into heavy coverage concealer Here I am
in shade light again I normally go for
shade light because I want to bump it up
a little bit to brighten the under-eye
while I'm covering this is a bang for
your buck right here so it's a drugstore
concealer Maybelline duh and it's it's
really really good lastly I'm going to
mention one that's just tried and true
then my makeup collection since I've
been putting makeup on my face this is
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer now this
is such a great just universal concealer
honestly and I know a lot of people it's
just so Universal that they even mix it
in with your foundation kind of like
make a foundation out of it and also
I've seen many many many people Mac
artists time their eyelids with it
because it has that prolong weird
technology in it so it's a multi-use
concealer it's 20 bucks who is not like
crazy price like the 30 for the NARS I
mean it's a little bit less of a
high-end concealer I hate the glass
bottle because I've broken these before
and then it's just like ruined I like it
when they use the plastic bottles why I
wanted to mention this one to you guys
is because the arrangement of colors I
recommend you going into a matte school
store and asking artists to help you
pick out your colors but they have the
lights in the
and the cool tone so you're not just
kidding you know a light concealer like
the other ones you actually are working
with a different tone that actually
works with your skin go chat it up with
them they will hook you up it's a very
long-lasting concealer by the way so you
need long lasting check out the pro
longwear by Mac it's supposed to be it
but I'm kind of a cheater and I'm kind
of sorta gonna mention six this is the
stroke of light by bare minerals and
technically it's not a concealer so
technically I'm not mentioning six
concealers because this is an under eye
brightener and let me tell you what is
just so fabulous about this product
right here it is really really
lightweight and really thin so it's not
gonna cover your under eye area and that
is not what I use it for I just wanted
to mention it at the end of this video
because I love highlighting my face with
it whenever you highlight your face with
one of these little gems back here you
can kind of get into a really heavy
makeup because you're putting a
concealer all over your face I like to
use the stroke of light by bare minerals
to highlight because it's just
brightening the area it's not adding
coverage to the area so you definitely
don't feel like a cake face but yet
you're getting that highlighted benefits
from it hello that's amazing and
luminous too so this is gonna be more of
a yellow tone cool shade what the heck
okay I feel like I should talk low or
else it's gonna fall alright so that is
it for my top 5/6 maybe 6 your eye
concealers I hope you guys enjoyed this
