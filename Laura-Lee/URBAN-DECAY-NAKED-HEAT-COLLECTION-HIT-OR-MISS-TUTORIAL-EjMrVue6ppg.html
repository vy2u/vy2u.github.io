today's video is going to be a very
impressive video and I've seen this
video all over YouTube so I almost
didn't film it what was it I caved in I
did it I'm going to be reviewing the new
Urban Decay heat collection so many of
you guys asked me to film it and like I
just said I just saw it everywhere on
YouTube so I was like ok I'll film it
I'm going to be doing it I love with it
and showing you how to use the pencils
that I shadow and swatches i don't know
i swatched this pal but i don't know how
it performs on the eyes I've had a
couple friends tell me that it performs
well so I'm excited and hopefully it
doesn't let me down you know I'm going
to keep it real with you and tell you my
thoughts all the way through now this
palette is $54 I cannot remember the
price of the smokey eye palette let's
look it up make it smokey was $54 I
remember back in the day these palettes
were around 49 50 but the packaging has
depth it's game of extreme so the price
is going up in the packaging and I feel
like the formula just from swatching it
I'll just go ahead tell you I feel like
the formula is very similar to the past
Urban Decay Naked palette I got my hair
cut a little bit I got these new little
bang Bang's and I wanted them because I
wear my hair up a lot and like the baby
hair so just like like straight up so I
figured if I got these little pieces cut
it close and reloj also recently got
these cuts kind of what inspired me to
do it but as you can see it like pull
the baby hair down and like this here
right here lays on top of the baby hair
so it helps the baby hair situation so I
got like little trim e trim and I think
I'm going to go a little lighter with my
hair and then maybe go completely dark I
don't know I love my hair a little bit
what you guys think leave me a note in
the comment on like what should I do
I mean it's hard to get hair that's
naturally dark light without it going
Orange but we'll see that was such a
rabbit trail if you didn't want to hear
that you can just skip on through make
sure this is good channel oh really
let's go we're going over the techno of
the version okay moving on let's jump
right in the video well okay let's get
good old close-up shots so it is this
pocket packaging that's plastic and it's
like this lays on top and underneath it
Rd is really cool
bars or became naked heat the back of it
is plastic and copper here are your
shades nice big mirror you get the
normal amount of shades really cute
naming of the shades the double-ended
brush which actually like the Urban
Decay brush is a lot I normally don't go
for the brushes in pellets but these are
good brushes oh let me go ahead and
swatch this for you by the way before we
go in so I heard there were lots of
dramas on swatches and it just seems
that coincidentally there's a lot of
drama with anything that's popping I
swatch and in house a problem with it a
magazine apparently like blogger matte
like a magazine did like a post on it
and they did a bad job too watching and
so the drama hits the fan and people
were lock it's a scale I don't think
it's a scam and I don't I don't think
companies send better pigmentation in PR
and I say that because you guys know I
buy a lot of makeup and I also receive a
lot in PR and I deal with both and I
really feel that vibe I also know how
manufacturing works and most
manufacturers you have to put in a
specific quantity for them to create
something like no less than 5,000 units
and so they're not going to create a
specific formula for about 100,000
people depending on how many PR packages
you're going to send out like
manufactures just they don't do that I'm
just keeping it real with you and
telling you my knowledge and why I don't
I think that that is just baloney and I
did on my snapchat sorry I'm likes
watching as we're talking but I down my
synapse at swatches and I showed you
guys how you can make this palette look
like if you want to or how you can
make it look great if you want to it all
depends on like how your swatching it I
did a swatch and just all three just
right down my arm and it will like
garbage and then I do what I'm doing now
I'm doing one two three one here are our
swatches they look beautiful and even
the darker ones on the end got a little
bit patchy but that's how I'm going to
leave the swatches so you can see how
they look now the filling in texture I
can see them blending out nicely but
we'll see what happens but I
like it is watching well and I feel like
the quality is going to be pretty darn
good based off how is till let's move on
to the eye pencil since watch both of
these the add pencils are going to be
twenty dollars apiece I have had a good
run with Urban Decay eye pencils in the
past I've kept it very honest on my
channel with Urban Decay there's been a
couple products that just didn't work
out for me and that's okay but there
eyepin tools and eyeshadows haven't
necessarily had an issue with oh these
are creamy so we have an orange a spicy
one called torch and then we have a
maroon e purple called alkaline I
believe and there you have it really
pretty cool that purple one's common a
three vice lipstick layer more than one
shade so they're suggesting you wear
more than one in layer L that means I'm
assuming these are going to be sheer
seventeen dollars a piece you get the
copper and gold packaging copper lid
gold packaging let's take a look at the
shades before i swatched them already
head over heels for fuel then we have
scorched which is a weird brown color
which I probably won't go for just not
my shade and then we have heat it is
sparkly red with like it Warren G fiery
undertone to it so here are the three
lipsticks yeah these are kind of sheer I
mean as expected the nude one is
beautiful and not sheer at all hilarious
and then the brown one is kind of sheer
so they're pretty so I'm gonna jump into
the business of starting an eyeshadow
look with this palette to give you guys
some in slope you're going to get it all
so definitely know let me know in the
comment section what are your thoughts
like are you like hell no or hell yes
about this palette I don't wanna so
first I'm going to go in with chaser I
know I've seen a lot of comments of
people saying you know I'm just sick of
the warm tones I get it there are 59
million warm tone palettes out there
with the warm Browns and the warm
shimmers I think this is a cool take on
a palette though because I just love the
color lineup personally I could see me
using this a lot the naked smoky palette
was the one that wasn't so much for me
just the color lineup it's not what I go
for and it was like all silvery and
dark mix these too soft and blow
together right here and this is a our 39
brush that I use all the time and it's
going to land it I'm actually going to
go a little out on this look like look
at them taking from the bottom corner of
my eye and like stretching it on out I
have if you haven't noticed already I
have like my base makeup done I had like
my bronzer blush highlight foundation
concealer setting powder all that done
already because we want to focus on the
eyes and lips for this look I'm leaving
at 3 a.m. so what in like 12 hours I'm
going to be on a plane headed towards
mayor cash I'm going there with YSL
beauty and I'm so excited so by the time
this video goes live I will be there I'm
actually going to grab a little bit of
he double right here I'm so fortunate to
get to travel to different places so
travel to Marrakech is going to be hell
up to four hour layover for an 80 d
person that's just hard time but I'm
going to work through it and we're going
to get there cuz I'm excited about the
trip and I'm excited about seeing a
different part of the world that I
haven't seen before an experience in
that I always get really weird about
leaving my cat so it's just like a thing
that I can't kick no matter what H I
have a cat sitter by the way that I pay
to stay with my cats and she takes
really good care of them and yeah so I
shouldn't worry about them at all but I
just love them so much I have so much
trouble just letting that be and being
like okay they're fine I just like they
miss me and I shouldn't ever leave them
ever I should go nowhere like I don't
know why I'm like guys have like that
thing about me that I can't get over I'm
going to take Shan want to mix these two
shades together right here still using
my same brush
and then take the deepest purple color
called ashes and just really smoke out
the outer corner I love a good matte
purpley brown I'm going to take scorched
pack oh gods gorgeous like the prettiest
color oh my goodness I'm going to go
back in with a little bit of ashes and
just soften up that corner right there
where the colors meet this is such a
pretty eye shadow I really want to do
something smoky and purple with the
liner so I'm going to try to do so it's
a little bit hard for me to do wings
with pencils
I think their line is really pretty I
ended up going in with this little brush
just winging it out a little bit I'm
going to take a little bit of in play go
and just hit that lower lash line and
now I'm going to take out and just pop
it in the inner corner I'm going to add
some mascara and lashes and I'll be
right back for lips I'm adding fuel
because it is the prettiest nude color
and it suckered me in and my eyes are so
dramatic I think this matches the best
alright guys this is the final look I
really enjoyed the palette I feel like I
love this palette probably a little bit
better than the other palette it's so
easy to use Urban Decay I did send this
to Maine Pyaar so it's pretty obvious
with my PR package but yeah I like to
tell a lot I think it's great quality
it's a big palette lots of colors no
it's not like a huge pan but I still
feel like you get so many different
color options it's really nice and also
I didn't show you the inside a book or
if it comes in here and it's like burnt
matches and then it slides int oh here
slice into this will look like that so
let me know your thoughts on this
palette down in the comment section down
below I love you guys thank you so much
for being here and watching and I
approve everything I think everything
was great I probably personally wear the
more sheer lipsticks just because that's
a personal preference but you do you boo
and the quality is great though quality
is there but subscribe to my channel
yellow alert subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
