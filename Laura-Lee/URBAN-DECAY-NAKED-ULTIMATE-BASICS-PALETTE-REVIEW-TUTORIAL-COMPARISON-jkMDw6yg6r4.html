let's jump into the review of the
palette it comes in a box like this the
Box looks banging it comes the back of
it looking like this looks super cool
the packaging is just killing it I think
it looks amazing I set up my background
today to match actually give a box the
palette launches September 18th and will
be on Urban Decay's website it's gonna
cost $55 or I got the palette I heard
about it and saw on Instagram I assume
the palette would be around 45 bucks and
then I heard 55 bucks I was like
I guess I should have known better
because these are 29 so if they put
double the shades plus a brush in a big
ol mirror they're gonna charge you more
you know get 12 brand new matte
eyeshadow shades here they are aren't
they just lovely it looks like you get a
lot of cool tone shades as well as warm
tone shade however these are a little
bit cool in the palette so you do get a
good variety
I think below is like shimmer I don't
really see that blow is a matte I see
you more so get 11 shimmers and one no
way what just happened you moreso get 11
mattes and one shimmer it's like
slightly shimmery whenever I was
blending these and they didn't show up
much on my skin tone because I'm very
medium skin tone I love a skin tone and
he's just blended right into my skin
words they were almost invisible if you
have a lighter skin tone I think these
will show up a little better so I
started to dip down into these a little
bit and they did show up on my medium
skin tone way better and then I started
twerking with these Racha
and I think they're the exact same
quality as the first two so I don't
think the quality has gotten bad and
sometimes companies have to switch their
manufactures whenever they come out with
product so you do get a little bit of a
different texture but after I swatch the
eyeshadow shades at first I was like oh
not obsessed and then whenever I got
into that I show you my makeup brush
after I had swatched them and then I was
like now we're cooking with grease I
feel like this would 90% of eyeshadow
palettes you have to get like past that
brand new layer of eyeshadow did dig in
there and it gets way more pigmented
whenever eyeshadow palettes are brand
new it seems like there's like this hard
layer over em which you don't get along
pigmentation from so what I personally
like to do whenever I get a new palette
in I recommend you do this too is I like
to swatch all the shades really
aggressively with my finger on the back
of my hand and just get that top layer
that eyeshadow off and then you really
get into the rich color you guys like to
dig you little fingers in your new
palette mm-hmm me too so let's compare
it to the Naked basics in The Naked
basics number two The Naked basics
palette is a $29 palette which is a
little pricey just in my opinion because
it's six eyeshadow shades and
like a mirror and $30 like it's so tiny
for 30 bucks
that's all that's a lie we all have a
different opinion on prices I understand
that clearly just doing my opinion out
there and the first one I adored is
beating up a little bit of had it for a
very long time oh my god I'm like
digging into the second one and the
second one is a bit cooler very Mafi
very cool tone gray tone brownie colors
in it both very wearable I personally
like the first one better than the
second one and the colors in both of
them are very similar now I know that is
12 brand new eyeshadows from Urban Decay
but they are very similar to their older
palettes I mean if you can see like
they're so incredibly similar I think
it's enough of a difference where you do
have both of these palettes this is a
good investment meaning you do get
twelve shades which is double for fifty
five dollars so it's actually a price
cut than buying these two by themselves
because you're saving five bucks and it
does come in with a double in it brush
where these little guys do not come in
with a double into brush you get a
fluffy into blend and then you get this
short little end which is great for
smoking out that lower lash line I love
that it's a basics palette but they add
it a little pop of like a silvery blue
and then they add it a little bit of a
plum color
how many basic eyeshadows can we have
guys before we just jump off a cliff I
just love whenever the basic palettes
have the most basic form of a colorful
color so like this brown purple color is
borderline dark brown but it's got like
a hint of color it's like the most
borderline way to incorporate color and
a basics palette and I think that they
hit the nail on the head whenever it
comes to that also I do recommend this
palette if you want to play with color
but not going to fight you a little bit
you don't know how to maneuver it into
your makeup look this is a good way to
do it with a palette like this because
like I said the shades are the most
neutral form of a colorful color if that
makes any sense like out of the three
palettes these are just so like Mabi
neutral just like I don't want to say
black but they're just like so just
plain Jane which is what they're meant
to be so that's good I feel like this
one just has is innate
get basis which is like a touch of spice
to it that is my review and comparison
of this palette if you guys want to see
the tutorial we're going to jump into
that now first up I'm going to go in
with pregame which is a yellow tone
color I'm just using this to soften up
my eyeshadow primer to make everything
more blendable this isn't really
necessary step then I'm going to go in
with commando which this is color it
didn't show up too well on my eyelids as
you can see it's almost nothing on my
eyelid so then I went down to tempted
and I still wasn't showing up to to to
pigmented as I wanted it to so then I
said to get into faith and lock out
which are the deeper Browns at the
bottom of the palette and then you
showed up a lot better for me I'm
blending these out with my e38 brush
from Sigma don't forget to use my
discount code to get money off your
brushes which is Laura Sigma but I just
focus this color on the outer corner
just swiveling it around then I take my
e25 brush from Sigma and I took instinct
with this M ma B purple shade as Linda
on that outer corner as well right on
top of faith and lock out next to deepen
it up a little bit I go in with lethal
sorry I'm having trouble reading the
name well label and I just pop it right
on top of instate I'm really building up
color and smoking out that outer corner
of my eye and lastly I add just a tiny
touch of a blackjack which is obviously
black and I just blend it on the outer
corner for my eyelid I take slow and
nudie mix them together and just swipe
it back and forth on to the lid as you
can see it's not like in crazy powdery
intense amount of color so they bare
they are very easy to work with
except I take my morphe gel liner I
think this is an e 11 liner brush and I
just winged it out and then I'm going to
add these Lily lashes in Miami we had a
lash glue catastrophe but we're going to
pretend that didn't happen then I blend
lock out on the lower lash line and then
I smudge lethal really close to the
lower lash line I added a little bit of
inner rim liner from Tarte and then some
mascara to my lower lashes to really
make the eyes
hop and I take this who knew beauty
liquid lipstick I'll have a link down
below because I can't remember I think
it's called material girl it's so pretty
it's a berry color and then I took my
Coastal Scents blush bronzer and
highlight palette I gotta add my
boxycharm this month of August which is
a 21 dollar monthly subscription if you
don't know what that is I'll have it
linked down below and I just contour out
my cheekbones I popped a little bit of
blush on my cheeks and I didn't use the
highlighter shade for this so this is
the final look I hope you guys enjoyed

video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
