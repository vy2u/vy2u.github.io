look it smells so good
hello everybody welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be me
using $2,000 worth of makeup on my face
and that does not include the cost of
makeup brushes that I'll be using so
really over $2,000 and that doesn't even
include taxes this is just the price
right off the top the price right off
the top so basically I'm great the
expenses I just want to let you guys
know in this video I am NOT trying to
tell you guys you need to go out and buy
all this to get a good look I'm not
trying so you need any of this stuff
I just basically I'm gonna pile on like
an a load of makeup and intent to get to
$2,000 is actually really hard getting
to $2,000 makeup is expensive but ain't
an expensive I try to pull like some of
the top most expensive products out
there to use and it was difficult I
literally had to go to like
Bloomingdale's and buy a bunch of bougie
stuff that I probably won't ever use
again great but it's all for YouTube so
I'm really excited to be filming this
video it's been going around people just
you know filming like an extremely
expensive face of makeup so I thought I
would do it I've actually done this
before on my channel I did like the
world's most expensive makeup like a
full face of it so this is kind of like
that kind of sort of
anyways that's jibber jabber from me
we're gonna sing the SUBSCRIBE song and
we're gonna jump into the video
subscribe to my channel before you leave
subscribe love you Laura now let's go
ahead and get started
all right first I'm going to clip back
my hair so it's not there's so many ow
ow ow extension tracks in this head yeah
geez that hurt I clip the track okay
okay by the way I have like this
beautiful ritual that I do where I pick
up my skin right before I feel my videos
there's red spots I did this to myself
first we're gonna start off with this
long calm this is one of their lip
moisturizers and this product look at my
bus to death now I'm gonna get my nails
done this week so pretend they're cute
and all but I'm gonna put this on it
cost $50 a $50 formula that's pricey but
let's go good on the lips and then to
prep my skin I'm gonna take this $74 I
don't know how to pronounce this brand
is that Sephora and that's where I got
it but someone in the comment section
help us out help me out you know let us
all know that is the brand name right
there
super bougie but this is a $74 base oh
it's like crushes the beads as it pumps
them through so that's what the product
looks like once it comes out and it's
supposed to be like a skin base it
doesn't smell like $74 if you're asking
what is $74 smell like well it smells
pretty good to me also to be extra
extremely bougie I'm gonna put on see
them how to put on a lot of makeup to
get to 2,000 bucks well let's try and
tell you guys but I love this stuff this
is the cherry blossom lip balm from
tatcha oh it feels so good so I'm
putting this on to you and this is 38
bucks
moving right along let's talk about
foundation I'm gonna be using the 230 la
powdery foundation but as you guys know
if you saw my video using this it
honestly don't take that sticky note it
honestly did not have enough coverage
for me so what I'm gonna do is mix it in
with the Sicily oh yeah another bougie
foundation this is a hundred and thirty
seven so when it makes two hundred
thirty dollars $137 foundations together
on my face did I use all the products I
don't want to put on my face before I
started I think it did okay
it was pretty on my skin it just wasn't
that full coverage so I want to see if
this sizzling one will be this is the
Fido tin expert don't even know who set
that right it's all free and I'm gonna
be using shade number two sand what I'm
gonna do is take my y6 brush which is
the only semi affordable thing in this
video this is $9.99 plus of course you
can use my oh my god oh my god I came
out like a liquid it was like you use my
coach we're 10% off morphe site lauralee
guys I want you to see like it literally
just sucks down in there girl mm-hmm
we definitely have more coverage mixing
the foundations but it's still not like
crazy full coverage I can't breathe when
I get around my nose you guys know that
okay that is um dye my skin count it
feels kind of heavy and greasy
like I don't know if you can tell it
looks a little greasy little cakey -
next up I bought this $75 lemare
concealer I've never used a lemare
consider before but I'm gonna see what
the tease about I got the shade medium
this is what it looks like it comes in a
stick form so I'm interesting just
interested to see how this plays out um
okay I'm gonna start coloring on my face
has a lot of pigment to which I like
that it seems like it's pretty full
coverage - and now I'm gonna take my
morphe this is like the contour sponge
I've really been enjoying this lately
I'm gonna take the $48 Tasha dewy skin
mist so this I typically would spray on
whenever I finished my makeup but you
can also go ahead and give your Beauty
Blender a little extra dampness and it
will often make your skin look extra
dewy if you blend this into your skins
this one I'm going to do I'm gonna use
sponge to blend this out
our concealer blended out really nicely
so I'm very impressed with it so next up
I'm going to go ahead and fill in my
eyebrow
oh no no no Jesus at her makeup before
it creases so what I'm gonna be taking
today I'll take the cover effects
perfecting setting powder which I really
enjoy along with that dampened morphe
sponge and I'm just gonna go ahead and
bake and set concealer now if you have a
really dry skin I completely understand
if you don't want to bake or you don't
want to like I had this much powder
because it does feel really tight and
dry once you get done baking but for me
this is super full coverage just a lot
of makeup and it needs like some pretty
extreme setting powder going on so I do
you like to bake and it also does add
the emphasis on brightening the areas
that I said that same brand that starts
with a G where I used to face base
I bought their face powder which is 53
bucks so I'm going it to this I also got
the shade number 2
oh man that's way too dark darn it I
think this is like a bronzer so is face
powder shoot shoot shoot shoot yeah
we'll just use the cover FX for all over
I thought I had a face powder why do I
not do our eyebrows so the benefit brow
pencil is 24 bucks probably one of the
lower price items out of all the stuff
I'm using today but I didn't have a
bushy brow pencil I just had like a
high-end brow pencil so I'm gonna fill
in these little caterpillars on my face
i tee is the shade number four and I
like to as you just saw me go ahead and
spooling my eyebrows up and then we'll
just start filling them in I typically
start at the bottom of the brow
okay I have on my eyebrows and now what
I typically always do is I add this NARS
concealer I think it's 38 if I'm not
mistaken I get a flat brush where you
normally do the m41 and I go ahead and
carve out the base and use this product
as my eyeshadow primer as well okay
today she doesn't have her import to one
because it's in my luggage and the rest
of them are so dirty they are not usable
so I'm gonna use the y21 which is also
really good to carve out the brows it's
already got some concealer on it because
I'd be used it but it's a good brush
okay next which is really exciting is my
palettes I'm gonna be using the brand
new Pat McGrath Pat McGrath I'm I'll be
using the brand name Pat McGrath I
should have had this is $125 I shoulda
pile it I'm also going to be using the
hundred and $69 star palette from
Natasha
Damona here are the colors I'm really
excited I'm gonna try to a clever look
and make you guys proud of me Natasha J
Nona I've definitely used before I've
talked about this palette a little bit
this palette is a hit and miss for me
the max and some of the shimmers are
hello get in focus there I am are
amazing and then these dusty ones
literally destroyed my look at a
meet-and-greet and it may look like I've
never put on makeup a day in my life
Oh scarred palette um how many uses
bujji goes along with the video and I
need some transition shade first I'll go
in with this pretty like peachy shade I
guess it's not peachy but it's like what
is this brush so dirty it is like a
brown but like a warm peachy undertone
to it so I'm gonna use as much
transition shade I'm using an e 27 brush
this is a really fluffy brush from the
elite collection whenever I put on my
transition shade I like to take a fluffy
brush and go in small circular motions
as well as windshield wiper motions and
honestly it's okay with transition
shades that they get some on your eyelid
I don't try to be as precise and clean
with them except I'm gonna go with this
brown shade I'm using an M 503 brush
with that brown Shea
and I'm gonna flip the brush up and I'm
really gonna work this shade in the
crease now as you guys have seen on my
channel I've been trying kind of hard to
like start working in and using
different colors on my channel and get a
little bit out of my comfort zone you
guys know I love a bronzy gold I want
anything in this world but I've been
trying so just know that and I hear you
and I see you in so much I see I'm
trying to add no purple oranges glitters
Pink's things like that that I don't
typically use to really give you guys a
variety so bear with me for those of you
who love color you'll be really excited
for some stuff coming from Lauren Los
Angeles we have some good stuff and we
also have some really good stuff that
you guys who love an everyday neutral
situation you guys are gonna gag you hmm
we have good stuff coming and we're
working really hard at Laura Los Angeles
to produce that but it takes a long time
for good quality makeup it just does
because girl the testing is unreal and I
won't stop until it's right look at
these colors from this Pat McGrath
palette geez so pretty I'm gonna take
this really pretty blue shade which is
one of my favorites from this palette
and I'm gonna start by it's so pigmented
applying it right here kind of closer to
the inner corner which is not only who I
start my makeup but this look that's
what we gonna do and I'm also using the
e36 little pencil brush so we can really
get precise gonna grab this really
pretty gold shade in the palette and I
focus it again with a clean a 36 right
here in the center
I'm gonna grab the darker blue I can't
oh not again but for the first I'm gonna
grab this darker blue and now what I
want to do is work this on the outer
corner of the eye and then deepen that
up I'm gonna go back in with the gold
shade and just add a little bit more on
top to kind of build emphasis on it such
a pretty shade so the edges that this
look are pretty but they're not soft
enough so I just want to go in with this
little bitty brush and just really start
to go back and forth so soft and just
soften up that harsh edge I have this
$80 buys our pallet and it says is a
lumi highlighting sculpt palette but
honestly none of these shades would work
for contouring for me so it confuses me
but anyway something to use this shade
this highlight shade right here
and I'm gonna pop it by the way neither
of these pallets have like a really
light champagne E or highlighting shade
so I'm just gonna pop in the inner
corner as well I dropped it oh Lord and
it scraped across one of these spins and
eye shadows I'm just gonna pop it with
that little 8:36 in that inner corner
and brow bone to go ahead and add the
highlight
I'm gonna take this $57 liner pin from
Tom Ford now I just the first time you
used it one side is brush tip one sides
felt-tip oh so bad like it's watching
for really bad and I'm nervous but I'm
gonna try to like use it uh okay the
felt sites doing pretty good because I
think my Pat McGrath is finally drawing
out a little bit so I'm just gonna apply
this on top to deepen it okay that looks
better
Thank You $57 pin now I'm gonna take
this lash curler curl my lashes the
Nance mascara I'm gonna take this $45
extreme Tom Ford mascara and apply it
all this a big brush
I'm gonna try these icon lashes drunk in
love with this Luke
I'm gonna take my $8.00 House of lashes
lash glue that is the dot of mascara
which we're gonna get off in a minute
then the meantime I'm gonna take that
brown shade the second shade and we use
from the nataschab Danone a palette and
I'm gonna blend that on the lower lash
line I'm gonna take the bright blue
shade that's in my inner corner here and
I'm gonna blend it on the outer corner
of the eye connecting it right there
with the outer edge I'm gonna take this
tiny tiny little brush I'm gonna apply
that gold shade that's in the center so
get a green gold I'm applying it in the
center of my eye down here and then I'll
go back in with the blue shade and put
it in the inner corner right there I'm
gonna take this black pretty vulgar
eyeliner and just do the waterline and
then I'll put on some mascara now it's
time to finish the face makeup I'm gonna
take this $50 Chanel cream bronzer one
of my favorites smells so good I'm gonna
take this brush that does not exist yet
and I'm gonna apply it to my face
I'm gonna take this $60 Tom Ford bronzer
and mix it I think this one was 53 the
one that I thought was the paste powder
I'm gonna mix them together one is a
little too warm and one is not pigmented
enough so they will be perfect hopefully
mixed together and this is our 14
contour brush one of my faves these bite
area blush little duo things are 46 but
bucks each so I'm gonna mix them
together and I'm gonna apply as blush oh
that's a pretty blush oh my gosh I'm
using an e for angled brush I have this
$60 liquid by Terry highlighter so what
I'm going to do it comes on a dropper oh
my gosh it was like crusty hello I'm
gonna add some too much oh my god I
cried out what the hell okay there's
some girl that ain't good
not for that much so anyways added some
to this end of my sponge I'm just gonna
let that blending okay not living for
that so next I'll take a Lila B I
believe the name is two sets of four
this is a cream highlighter I'm just
gonna take the sponge wanna see boom
this is pretty you know it's kind of
subtle still still think we can use my
I'm gonna take some these iconic London
illuminator drops that are like super
highlighting there we go
really get that glow and now I'm just
gonna go back to that Weiser palette and
add like a little bit to the tip of my
nose and I'm gonna add some to the
Cupid's bow as well I'm actually gonna
take the lighter shade in this Lila B
bronzer because this shade is really
great for my nose we're just gonna
snatch my nose a little bit more when I
take this $40 Christian Louboutin lip
liner
let me be real this is not our $40 it's
crappy s crap it doesn't even show up
for real like I don't like this I don't
recommend this to you and then I'm also
