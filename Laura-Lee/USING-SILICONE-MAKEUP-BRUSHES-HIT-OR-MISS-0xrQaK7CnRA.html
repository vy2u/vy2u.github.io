in cat hair at all points of your life
look long you know hey guys what is up
Ellie we have food in my teeth what's up
and welcome to my channel today's video
is going to be testing out silicone
makeup brushes so weird
I found these brushes on Amazon and a
light piqued my attention on the site
yeah we're going to film video on those
they were actually pretty affordable
course I'll have a link down below they
often seem like they could potentially
be a gimmick is the gimmick or is it not
around my doorbell ringing I have a
delivery I'll be back
all righty I just got a really cool
package from benefit all know sunshine
yeah I know that was I'm all over the
place I cannot think about what I was
doing because so many distractions but
let's go ahead and jump into the video
but before we do we have to sing a
little jingle this is one of my new
merch shirts if you haven't gotten it
check out the link down below chopped
barley Los Angeles calm and we'll go
ahead and jump right into the video
our brushes just to give you guys a
visual of what we will be working with
today they are pink and they already
Loki feel like they're going to fall
apart because if you can hear that the
glue is like kind of falling apart in
them but that's a pig they're so
affordable I mean I didn't really expect
the world out of them
I just thought the actual silicone brush
part was very interesting and I went to
some of that with that being said I have
all kinds of shapes I'm going to go
ahead and apply foundation with this I'm
going to take my Milani purse purse till
we can put the words into one pencil and
perfect foundation this is shade of five
and I'm going to I feel like I'm like a
painter spackling my face I'm going to
get some on the brush by doing this up
so weird I'm going to start painting my
face this fills in a silicone EB blender
that I reviewed it wasn't my favorite
but it just obviously this is silicone
brush so it's reminding me of that
product a little bit I will say anytime
you use something that's not a brush the
product just goes ten times longer
because nothing is bring the product
I'm signing is I actually don't hate
this product actually like it better
than the Eevee blender because it's more
thin and the Eevee blinnder kind of
looks like a rock I feel like on MySpace
as you can see it's really bendy so I
feel like it's not as rough my
foundation is not looking too shabby
like I really don't hate this product
the only thing I will say is I feel like
it tugs a little bit more than a regular
makeup brush just because it is so cold
but look how like flawless that looks
I'm kind of like oh they're not using
quite as much product I have to cover up
this big ol zit on my forehead so
annoyed but I'm going to be in salt
water I'm just going to dunk my whole
head in the ocean and be like heals it
ill I think that is a stress zit which
is well deserved because you know as
soon as I do like a all about me video I
don't want stressing variety and then
just dealing with a makeup line rethink
and stress you out sometimes so that is
my well deserve stress bit and someone
on is to live the other day said we
should call him Oswald so guess what his
name is Oswald visit hopefully he won't
be with us for much longer okay to be
honest I don't hate this I actually kind
of like it we'll use it everyday no
because nothing can replace my wife six
but actually don't hate the brush I feel
like you got more use out your product
now this is way sticks I didn't know but
you know it goes a lot longer if you can
look my skin there's no brush streaks
it's just pretty flawless it was a
little bit difficult getting around the
nose area but as far as the Blin I'm
here for it next up I have I found this
interesting brush I don't really know
maybe I'll use I use it for concealer
but I'm using the chart shape tape in
medium light or light medium like me Oh
light neutral this is not my shade very
good I'm just going to add a little bit
because this stuff goes a very long way
I'm going to go ahead and brighten the
under eyes well can still do it little
down the nose and then I'm going to put
a little bit on the chin to conceal as
well and I checked out this one I think
you can get creative will make
brushes and you don't have to always use
them for what they say they are for I
typically do that and this just has that
you shape in it it's like it would be
great for the under eye as you can see
it like tugs pretty hard and I know a
lot of people don't like that and I
should have thought hello this is going
to make your product go longer than
usual Laura shouldn't put as much makeup
look I want a little bit too much
concealer to blend out because this
isn't absorbing any of the product but
that's okay oh look at that getting
really tacky like oh my let's just keep
it going I'm going to tap now since we
aren't doing the under eye I will say
just because the under eye skin is so
sensitive this does feel a little bit
rough and I do prefer I make it fresh
again the blend is flawless and it looks
really pretty nice vibe like on the chin
or the forehead just because I've
skinned that area it's not quite as
sensitive and can take a little bit more
of a beating if you will but the under
eye I'm going to go ahead and not really
recommend this for the NRI just because
to protect your under eye and eyes it
actually hurts and this is way too hard
and I'm like ow ow ow but the blend girl
the blend is there like already what do
you guys think and we love reading your
comments I love reading comments and
they're actually about the product too
clearly the silicone product is for not
powder form or creams but I mean for
shits and giggles I put some powder on
here oh and I actually don't recommend
it for powder because it picks up the
powder and it like really presses it
into one area where the brush exit or
sponge is a bit lighter and it like
really disperse the powder which is what
you definitely want with your powder
speaks first
next I have this really like swushi
angled one and I think it could be
really cool to blend a lay cream contour
so I have my Mac click search quick
trick stick which is a little stick
cream contour this is in my favorite
lately and we're going to see what
happens here's our angled friend but I
don't know can you hear that like it's
Wibbly about to break off Nachi watching
I really just want to get sponge so glad
right now I gotta have it and just go to
town and get this blended I take this e
54 and go ahead and swipe away the
excess powder and now let's try to
continue I mean it's definitely blending
it it just honestly this takes way more
time than just a beauty blender or brush
I don't like it for the contour I feel
like with contour you have to be very
precise to get the darkness and very
certain areas and with this brush it
kind of verses it everywhere is very
difficult to get it in a precise area so
actually don't like with cream contour
and the under eye area is a little bit
rough before actual foundation I did
like the brush I'm going to take an r/a
brush and just polish this look up I
didn't hit my funny bone I've heard well
oh god it's the second time I've done
this this week
next up we have an angled brush you guys
can see these four liner or eyebrows I'm
going to use it for eyebrows today
because I have a liner brush on deck I'm
going to dip into my benefit browsing
which has powder and wax so first I'm
going to go in it looks kind of
difficult to pick up the product with
the waxy side just feeling like this is
the biggest not good thing I've ever
done to my brow it is so hard to get
this product dispersed with this
I feel like brush hairs are the real MVP
when it comes to like getting those that
product in between the brow this is not
eyebrows I'm proud of so I'm going to
dip into a little bit of a powder on the
angled brush
no next we have an eyeshadow brush this
could be interesting
I'm going to give it a fair shot by
using a cream product with this
obviously a powder product I mean I
already try it with the power in my face
it didn't work out so a clone Tyler girl
is just a hot-ass man
so next I'm going to go in with I've
tried to got my channel like the I do
this one is an old flick I'm I go I
should look how it picked up that
problem you look at diet consists of a
lot of product I'm excited about that
um hi hello let's see what happens when
we apply it to our go any like how idea
one eyebrow
she is not committed to that brush um I
actually just adore it this is probably
worth 10 times better than even a
synthetic brush when it comes to a cream
or eye goo like this just was a real
champ I'm actually a little shook as as
to how well that just applied the
product and I feel like I didn't waste
any product because the brush is
silicone I think we just found a new
genius tool for our little cream
products we have a win as far as
foundation and cream eyeshadow products
that was really great for the other
stuff is a little bit of a struggle but
I mean normally just be fair I look at
rands ition shade but in about the
transition shade today it's about
silicone brushes so we don't keep it at
there we're going to I we ran away on my
eyeballs to dry and then I have a
eyeliner one which is interesting looks
like this but like a little eyeliner
brush with silicone so I was gel
eyeliner we're going to test it out with
okay I've coated the brush this is an
essence gel liner that I actually like a
lot very affordable and now I'm going to
go in and try to this eyeliner can we
just not be distracted by this eyebrow
although I feel like I know you guys are
distracted by that eyebrow here I get a
double glue right there with my mistake
we're not going to blame the brush
um I actually struggle on the struggle
bus right now and I feel like the
silicone for whatever reason is making
the liner get really dry really quick
it's also tugging my eye so harshly that
it's really hard to get a straight line
I am going to try to wing it out part of
me feels like my product is being a turd
and not the brush but I do like this
liner Sonam life when it is finish you
um I feel like the silicone was so rough
it was snatching up the eyeshadow a bit
and making it like all chunky through
there but as far as like if you was just
doing winged liner it was a little bit
more difficult but it can be done my
makeup looks a little bit wonky but it
normally does at the end of all these
travel videos so with that being said
that is the end of this video and we
definitely had hits and misses I liked
it for foundation and I liked it for
cream eyeshadow for eyeliner is a little
more challenging but clearly it can be
done it was just snatching up my eye
show so I curated winged liner with it I
recommend doing it without any eyeshadow
