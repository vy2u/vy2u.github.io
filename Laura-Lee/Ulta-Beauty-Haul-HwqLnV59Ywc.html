video is going to be a big ol fat juicy
Ulta haul seriously this bag is uh great
and I actually ordered some online in
some in store and just brought it all
together for a big juicy haul video I
got in a really nice gift card to Ulta
and that is what this is so a lot of
things I've been wanting to purchase
myself but I just haven't gotten around
to doing it or I was just like no I'll
pass this time whenever I got the gift
card I'll say okay I'm finally gonna buy
it
Sartain thanks I have been really
wanting so I'm gonna share with all
these kiddies with you we're gonna jump
right in and get started if you liked
the video give it a thumbs up
firstly I got that I had really had my
eye on for a while my sister got it and
she's like it's okay curb but she's
really picky so I think I'm gonna love
it
um this is the Little Rock Pro contour
palette and it actually comes with a
brush and no idea came with a brush
ordered it online I thought I just got
the palette so I don't know that was
like a special if they all come with a
brush it's the palette it's a good
mediocre sized palette and then it looks
like you come with their highlights big
with the three shades and then the three
lighter like setting powders and then a
highlight for the cheekbone and the
brush feels really soft yeah I like it
but the colors just feel like that
genuine genuine
that little rock staple like super super
pigmented soft color so I think if you
use this palette or when I use this
palette I'm gonna have to use like an
extremely light hand with it because if
we get too crazy things can just go
south next thing that I picked up these
have become my favorite a little facial
wipes these are the wet cleansing toilet
towels
pehle palette from Olay these like are
so simple like their excuse me it
literally there's like not much to them
they do smell really nice and clean but
they're just simple they don't burn my
eyes when I use them and they remove my
makeup really well and the towels are
huge to come out of them and you get 30
per pack they're really big so I'll be
living that girl next from Ulta this is
like the ultimate ah beautiful Isis
inside piece I should have said their
eye crayon they look gorgeous it looks
like you get a white one a like granite
grayish one a silver a champagne and a
brown and they're all really pretty
shimmery so I'm gonna be playing with
these from Tarte I picked it I hope this
was a really good deal 35 bucks for four
of their Amazon clay blushes however
these are smaller like they're not the
normal size it's funny about packaging I
just want to say they always have a
sticker that you have to pick off to get
the package open what I always do is
just open it from the bottom cuz there's
never a sticker there oh well admit I
did open this and take a peek at these
and I
I love all the colors that come in the
set I think they're all pretty neutral
color so you know anyone could wear them
also like the metallic design is so cute
though only Jesus sucks about like
holiday sets and stuff like that that
after Christmas I really are like after
they're sold out like I won't use them
in my tutorials typically because you
can't your hands on them and I don't
like to use stuff that you guys can't
get cuz it's just like I think that I
got to have been dying for is the ariana
grande at perfume her new spray re
smells so good actually about the
rollerball in him because I'm obsessed
with roller balls and I never buy like
big perfumes because I don't know I just
like to change up my scent too much you
know and I don't want to like collect
nine hundred perfume bottles to sit
around for like three years just not
necessary
I bought the rollerball and I'm kinda
upset so I went ahead and I bought the
smallest version and about the smallest
version and now that I went from the
rollerball to the smallest version now
I'm gonna go from this to the very
biggest one it's like I just can't stop
like this is my favorite smell right now
it smells so good if you're at Ulta give
it a little sniff aru's e you know what
I'm gonna put it right there
you see that super cute is the OPI
starlight collection um yes please and
thank you I will admit I did actually
send this to me but I figured I would
share moles all because I'm is that Ulta
layer they're all full-size holy Toledo
and the colors that comes in it are so
pretty actually I already used one the
one that some might now is give me space
which is a sparkly blue color and then
it comes in this cute little box so you
can organize them and store them in I
think I picked up was another contour
kit and I didn't realize ended up with
to contour kids but you know we just get
contour crazy and I got neon associated
corn contour kit and I never had this
kid forever and a day but I picked him
another one because my other one is a
busted mic it has seen better days so
this one is just sold pretty and fresh
I've been using Java like everything
good I love this cool cool cool tom
brown color so pretty so pretty yes
the only thing that kind of speaks about
this palette is that I could pretty much
never use this dark dark brown color so
some colors go to waste
like my one I already have a bunch of
the colors I've hit pan but there's some
that I haven't even touch so the thing
that sucks would like contour palettes
custom colors are just like way too dark
or way too light for you and then some
are absolutely perfect but I know you
can buy the pans to refill and this but
I'm just a person I'm just like whatever
I'll show you bad palette and live with
it pick this up in store this is the
starch treatment um but hey it comes
with a drip dry would you like drop this
on your nails like a little drip drip
dry you drop a drip this is just like a
nail take care of your nails or help you
polish your nail set I don't remember
how much this was they are mini so more
nail polish I know like what's wrong
with me
anyway I bought the ZOA and nail
polishes I've had some so nail polishes
before I believe they used to come in
like an entity bag or something like
that and they're really good nail
polishes they're not even that cheap
though but these colors look so freakin
pretty these are like all really neutral
nudie colors which whenever I'm less
just like in a fluster and don't know
what it paint my nails I always offer a
nudie color so I'm on are all crusty and
dried out and then it comes with this
black thing which I do not know what
this is but we a mountain to find out
what is it Cameron oh it's a lipstick
what the hell I didn't even know you
made makeup look at that what it's a
nude lipstick actually looks really
pretty okay next thing that I got is
love at your lips the six piece lip
collection so it looks like these are
lip balms oh it's like all kinds of lip
products you get a matte lip cream a
butter bomb a lip crayon a lip liner a
butter a lip butter and a lipstick and
these are all from Ulta and it looks
like yes these are all random color from
pink to maroon etc the thing that I got
is the Becca shimmering skin perfector
and moonstone side champagne pop opal I
don't have the rose gold one and then I
don't know I have a few of these and I
love them but I've never tried moonstone
and that's awesome when you use it the
other day I can't remember but this
looks so pretty on their cheekbone so I
had to get moonstone I mean so now I
have all but the rose gold one so now I
have to get the rose gold one do you see
how this happens do you see how this as
I already warned it and I really do like
it it does have like this teeny tiny bit
of a champagne undertone in it so it's a
very pretty color and of course the
quality of the Becca highlighters are
like lastly I did get the shine bright
collection from Tarte which this is
another one they're holiday collections
it comes with this eyelash curler that
has like rhinestones all over it
was really pretty and the lash curler
actually works really well so very
impressed with that
and then it also comes with a little
bitty mini of this mascara this is their
lights camera flashes not lashes mascara
and I have never used this before
anything so I didn't know anything about
the mascara and I open it and it is one
of those plastic prickly wand and I use
the mascara and it is very lengthening
not volumizing really at all but I found
like itching this freaking turtleneck
length in my lashes and like separate it
with them really well so they they
didn't look clumpy at all I don't know I
liked it I feel like it will work better
paired with another mascara and not like
on its own but we'll see what happens
anyway that is it for this old AHA if
