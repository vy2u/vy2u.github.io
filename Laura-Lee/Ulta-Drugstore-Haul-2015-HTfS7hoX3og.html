yeah he's welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be in they're all
alcohol got like the twenty percent off
coupon at Ulta and I had a field day in
there because of the coupon
everything I got was drugs were except
for one thing and that is because the
20% off coupon only workhorse drugstore
stuff and there's a lot of I've had my
eyeball on and then warning so I took
the opportunity and I got it coming room
in this home video we're now covered in
cat air that's cool I got a receipt
that's taking over my life and then I
got these Vegas mail lashes these are
the grand glamour which are probably the
prettiest mr. Maddox okay dramatic ones
and they're kind of these are kind of
hard to get because they're always sold
out I still like the ones in the purple
package I want to say they're shining
star but I don't know these I just
really wanted and they had one pack so I
got the one pack next from makeup
revolution which seems to be a pretty
new brand at Ulta at least from my
oldest is a newer brand this is the
makeup revolution London ultra bronzed
palette all about bronze and I'll see
like a particular shade on it so you get
hot eight high payoff bronzer powders
can we get her open and here we have it
very nice hard plastic palette I'm
impressed palette cost me 10 whopping
bucks
the bronzers are a little bit small but
it's pretty cool because you have these
two this one looks like I miss a
highlight shade with like light shimmer
in it and then this one looks like a
bronzer with gold running through it and
then this one looks super shimmery and
pretty so let me do a little swatch only
thing is these maybe I don't know seems
kind of warm tone which I don't like
warm tone browsers because you get that
a warranty look can't look at all funky
but maybe the top roll okay so they're
really soft they feel like extremely
soft I don't know the Chloe payoff is
pretty nice too I mean oh ye using this
maybe it's worth something
and I'll follow up and let you know like
how they wear on the skin and how they
collide on the skin because you don't
really know until I Q wear it per full
day
also from makeup revolution I got their
cover and conceal this is the ultra
cover and conceal palette this one is
light medium I think they have light
line medium and medium dark so I got the
middle one which typically works best
for me and again this one was $10 as
well so that's a good price and one nice
packaging it looks the same this says
blush palette but it's the bronzer
palette I just noticed that like on the
front says watch out what ok the
concealer palette looks very nice and it
could be potentially a good contour
palette maybe ooh very soft potentially
a contour palette but I don't know this
shade will be dark enough for me to
contour with I might would have to get
the light medium in the medium dark
palette to contour with so I would have
my lights and darks oh wow these are
like super creamy in I don't really know
how they're gonna wear are they gonna be
drawing Creasy I'm not sure but I'll try
them out I'll follow up with you guys
and let you know my thoughts on them but
they're only 10 bucks apiece so it's a
we're good I would say this is a heck of
a dose you get a lot of product in each
palette right along I picked up one more
thing from makeup revolution this is the
makeup revolution London the matte blush
and this was only 5 dollars in this
blush is humongo so this one isn't
actually and shade nude that few other
shades today were they're like hot hot
pink or like a color they wouldn't even
show up on me so almost like aunt I'm
gonna let you keep them Alta I also had
really pretty individual bronzers but of
course my Ulta was sold out of them so
this feels nice and soft super good
color payoff and a very pretty color so
the one nude is gorgeous and I'll be
trying it out as well next I picked up
the ole free eye makeup remover from
Neutrogena never tried this stuff but I
had some really pricey eye makeup
remover from NARS which worked so good
like it was the best but I'm just not
willing to
the money on make it remember so I'm
gonna travel the Neutrogena kind I think
I've heard good things about it
it says no oily residue which makes me
wonder if it's gonna work because
normally this stuff would the Olli
residue works and it says it takes off
waterproof mascara so the reason I like
to use this stuff is to get my a lot gel
liner off because that stuff is
ridiculous to get off then I also picked
up something that I've tried before but
I had never had the big size one and
this is the hydro boost water gel
hydrant from Neutrogena
so I mentioned in a video before that
gel moisturizers are water-based
and cream moisturizers are nine times
out of ten they're oil-based so they're
gonna call your pores if you have an
issues with acne I would not I I would
stick with the gel moisturizer and this
is a good one from the drugstore some of
you guys really which one should I get
that's affordable
this one was twenty but it was like on
sale for like I don't know I got it for
less than twenty and then I got my 20%
off too so it it turned out to not be
too expensive but you get a lot of
product in here oh and it smells so nice
and clean it's a good water-based gel
moisturizer it's gonna be lightweight
super moisturizing but not clog your
pores
I literally just caked it all over my
hand but you know it doesn't matter
because it's not gonna clog my hand pour
completely oil-free not gonna have to
worry about the business mess of your
skin because I know a lot of acne
treatments are extremely drying on your
skin and can leave your skin red and
irritated and you just want to take on a
cream moisturizer or some grease to fix
that but you have to be careful because
clogged pores cause acne and so try a
gel moisturizer that's actually really
moisturizing but lightweight on the skin
and all free and they can change your
life next I got an eyeliner a gel
eyeliner that you guys recommend it to
me so you guys told me that the
Maybelline studio eyeliner is great and
the problem I'm having was I have a
bazillion gel eyeliners Bennetto more
drugstore and I like to do drugstore
makeup tutorials and every time I have
to use my NYC liquid liner I don't have
a problem with that but sometimes I want
to switch it up so I thought I would try
this and the
amazing and then it may be money
favorite gel eyeliner it comes with this
little brush which I seriously doubt
I'll be using because the only brush
that I can perfect gel liner with it's
with the EO Six Sigma brush I'll link it
down below it's it's crazy good moving
on I also got some more duo lash glue in
black I really like the black one versus
the white or the clear one because it's
not really white and it's not really
clear and it's ruining my makeup because
so many times I would use that and it
would be clear but you could still see
like the bumpy texture from the glue and
it would just look gross the black one
works way better for me just cuz it
correlate to my eyeliner or even if I'm
not wearing eyeliner it kind of goes in
with the mascara and doesn't look all
crazy so that's why I like the black one
but great story I have this faux fur
white rug underneath me in this spell on
the ground without the lid on it and I
proceed it to step on it and it exploded
all over a white rug so I'm not really
sure how I'm gonna go about getting it
out I'm probably just gonna let it dry
and try to like cut the little pieces
out anyways moving right along I got
some eye shadow and I got this one I
shadow I'm like 90% sure I have a shade
just like this but you know when you're
in the store you just swear that you
don't that you don't have anything like
this and you need it in your life okay I
got this infallible pigment from Laurie
oh this one isn't glistening garnet 557
I've never been disappointed by these I
love all of the infallible pigments they
were some of the most pigmented
eyeshadow from the drugstore I highly
recommend amber rush to you if you don't
have amber rush get amber rush first
it's life-changing it is so beautiful so
I got the yeah that one God ain't
mascara this one is the is my L'Oreal it
is the voluminous but apply what approve
Hydra mascara now the one is a little
bit entertaining to me because it's
entertaining I don't know big hollowed
out I don't know it's all kinds of weird
and I'm interested in it to see what its
gonna do for me however I got waterproof
and I don't think I'm
to get waterproof because I hate
waterproof mascara I'm not gonna take it
back now because I never I never do that
next
and lastly see this wasn't a crazy big
old sow home we did pretty good
look lastly I got the finally finally I
got the Laura killer baked Luminizer and
guilted honey and I used it already and
put it back in the box to pretend like I
didn't use it it the thing that makes me
crazy but is is the packaging looks
cheap this looks like really cheap
drugstore packaging and the higher is
quite small but this is a more
affordable of the high-end house was 28
I know the Bekaa ones are 38 you do get
less product but it is a little bit more
affordable and everything that this is
hyped up to be it held true to I'm
wearing it today I mean I know the
lights playing out but you can see that
glow don't melt like you can't see it
you see it highlighter is probably my
own my all-time favorites honestly and I
love it so much it is worth the $28 and
I'm glad it's not 38 which makes it a
little bit more affordable and a little
bit more understandable to buy but it is
beautiful laura geller killed it with
this one if you sold out at your old
size just know you can buy online at
also calm last time I checked it was
still 4 so on there and that was like
two days ago so I definitely recommend
it to you that was the only high-end
thing I got and I wasn't gonna mention
it because it's more of a drugstore haul
but I figured why not at the very end
that's it for this video have you
subscribed you haven't
well why join the YouTube family bring
it in let's hug I hope to see you all in
my next video I love you guys and I hope
you have a happy Sunday
