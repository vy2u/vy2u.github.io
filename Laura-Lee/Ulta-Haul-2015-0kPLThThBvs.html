video is going to be in alcohol and I
know I've been hauling a lot lately and
I apologize if that's a note we love
crooked I apologize if that's a little
bit annoying to many of you guys you
don't like seeing cause most of you guys
seem to be really enjoying my videos I
haven't had anybody complain and I
enjoyed filming haul videos here I am
with another haul I went to Ulta for one
thing I was snapchatting on it's like
I'm going here for one thing and I
walked out with two little bitty bags
because they ran out of big bags and the
crazy thing is so 21 days of old tow
starts today and I went before it
started so I missed out on good deals
because I'm a crazy person but anyways I
just got like lots of random random
stuff and I love going to Ulta because
you get the drugstore and the high-end
so you get a little bit of both worlds
and I really love that about Ulta I
haven't been at Ulta in forever and that
is because they were so incredibly rude
to my mom whenever she went there I was
just like forget also you know what
Sephora is where it's at you know even
though I'm not you know all those are
bad or all the employees are bad because
my mom's had more than one bad
experience they are I've had bad
experiences there I was just like I'm
not going there so it's been literally
months and months and months it's
probably six months maybe less since
I've actually been in an Ulta because of
that but I went back gave it another
shot
because then nothing also so bad it just
really pissed me off and ever there
shouldn't lead to my mother cuz that's
my mama you don't mess my family uh-uh
all tough I will take you down on the
lighter note we're gonna jump right in
this haul and I hope you guys are
excited to see
yeltsin right in this video you see
here's the 21 days of old tubs and i
missed out on everything cuz i'm
obviously not gonna go back after i've
spitting this money just hanko happens
anyways I'm Rev along the thing that I
went to also for was something that you
guys told me to get because I've been
polishing my own nails lately and you
guys told me that I needed to stop
buying the julep gel topcoat and freedom
because it's $18 for the little bottle
and I go through it like crazy you guys
recommend it to me the diamond flash
topcoat of ice I love Sally Sally by
Sally Hansen you guys said it's a total
dupe and it dries in 60 seconds like
that is my main thing with the clear
topcoat I needed to dry fast because I'm
just so I'm not a very patient person
I'm really like porky and I mess my
nails up every single time I paint them
even when they're drying past so you can
imagine when they're dry slow it's just
a disaster the next thing that I picked
up with a bottle of dry shampoo by dub
I've used this dry shampoo before and I
have plenty of dry shampoo and my
haircare cabinet but I have an addiction
to buy dry shampoo and I I ran out of
this kind and I really really like the
way it smells so I bought another got
another hair product this is my
Kardashian beauty and their new hair
line came out and I wanted to buy one of
everything of their hair line but it's
just so unnecessary because I have like
four or five bottles of hairspray that
are half used and I want to start to use
them up so I didn't buy another bottle
but I did buy this because this is
something that I don't have this is her
smooth style err blow dry cream and it's
made with black seed oil and honestly
I'm just really curious about it and the
smoothing effects on the hair and again
this is my Kardashian beauty this is one
of their newer products they also have
like hair tools they came out with but
they're a little bit pricey but this was
and this was like twelve dollars or
something like that yes girl we don't
have some old hair next I got the roller
lash by Benefit this mascara is amazing
and as you guys
no support I sent me a like deluxe well
it was like a full-size tomb of it and
it was like a mystery tube and I didn't
know what I was using and they told me I
was using the roller lash of indigestion
the whole time and it's so amazing this
it makes some good mascara is because
the they're real mascara was awesome I
think I shove a little bit left in my to
of that which I kind of forgot about and
then they came out with roller lash like
they just know what the business is
about with mascara
lastly out of this baggie the Neutrogena
Beach defense water and Sun barrier
sunscreen this seems like a really
powerful sunscreen and I'm actually
going to the beach today right when I
get in I'm filming this video so I'm
gonna be some sunscreen to protect this
skin I'm in because you only get one
skin people protect your skin and I love
all Neutrogena sunscreens they're just
awesome and they do such a great job in
protecting your skin from the Sun so
yeah next digging into the second bag I
picked up a melted lip gloss from Too
Faced summertime and springtime is right
around the corner and of course I needed
a pink melted lippy because I don't have
any pain lipstick I don't know what my
issue is but you guys know I love to buy
me some lip products and I actually put
it on this I think I actually have
something from Too Faced just like this
but maybe a little bit lighter and I
actually put this on this morning and I
was like no not in the mood for pain but
it's just the melted lippy and this one
isn't melted a fuchsia yeah okay you'll
still like that next I got some 3d crest
white classic vivid the teks trippy
things I know a lot of people say that
these hurt their teeth they don't ever
hurt mine but they did make some I saw
there were like painless and spur
sentences and they won't like her your
teeth whenever you use them because
Tyler whenever he uses them they hurt
his teeth really bad but I'll bite I got
a problem
come on teeth brushed wrong I'm just
kidding I don't even know
what I'm not into dinner Estie I don't
know but these always work so well I
just feel like my teeth are looking a
little dingy and all the lighting makes
my teeth look wider than what they are
I am a youtuber and I can declare a
lighting makes your teeth look super
white so if you're thinking there's a
conspiracy going around why all
youtubers have super white teeth girl is
daylighting next I got something from
Pacifica Beauty actually have two things
from Pacifica the first thing that I got
are these purify coconut water cleansing
wipes
I love cleansing wipes I don't know why
lately I used to never use them but
lately I've just been using a let them
right and burning through them so I
wanted to try a different brand
I love Pacifica it's such a great brand
so I thought why not trying their
coconut water cleansing wipes and I like
the little pouch where like closes so
they like it actually clicks closed so
they won't dry out super nice I got the
Pacifica all right multi mineral BB
cream had a real hard time reading that
this new cream is from Pacifica first of
all the packaging just sells to me well
you are just gorgeous just gorgeous
I don't know Pacifica is on point with
their marketing and their packaging but
this just interests me a lot I think
maybe was the pink and gold tubes anyway
I like baby creams for the springtime
and a little bit for the summertime
because I feel like whenever I'm out and
about like when I go golfing sometimes
I'm not that good when I go golfing or
to the beach or something I want
something that has lots of sunscreen and
just a wee bit of coverage in it so
that's when I get to my BB Creams
and I thought I'd try a new one for the
summer my favorite is the benefit the
Big Easy that's like my favorite BB
cream zoom we're gonna see what you got
in ya I step back that is it for this
alcohol I hope you guys enjoyed
it is quite a random selection of
goodies but that's what else is about
you know could you get all the kinds of
stuff in there there's a cat scratching
at the door we're not even gonna discuss
this cat right now but just know he's
here that is it for this haul video I
