video is going to be a date I look and I
did like this pink very smoky eye with a
really pretty pretty lip color I had an
itch also in this video I have teamed up
with cosmopolitan and they sent me this
gorgeous bag is their swag bag and it's
full of goodies I'm gonna unpack it for
you first before we begin the tutorial
the first thing that comes in it is the
Cosmopolitan magazine of course and on
the cover we have the gorgeous Miranda
Lambert Cosmo magazine is one that I
have been reading since I was really
little I've always loved Cosmo and I
know it is a more mature magazine but I
always read it definitely one of my
favorite magazines out there on the
market is an amazing magazine big thing
that came out is the Tresemme hairspray
and I put it back in the bag because I
did use it for today's look I use it to
slick down the center part of my hair
and all the crazy baby hairs they try to
take over that was a quick look on how I
do that
this is the Tresemme this is the number
four or hold hairspray so it's a pretty
good hold hairspray it's all day
humidifying a resistance so yeah next
product out of the bag is the Maybelline
the nudes palette we've talked about
this now before on my channel so you
guys are pretty familiar with it but it
is by Maybelline and it comes with 10
different eyeshadow shades a mixture of
matte and shimmers and they are all
neutral shades hence the name the next
thing out of the bag is the product that
I am a most excited about because I love
this product the most of the bag this is
the visionary 1-minute blur by Lancome
this is a facial primer such a great
facial primer it does a great job for
smoothing out the skin and just making
it look absolutely a full lawless and
then you put your foundation on top of
it I do use this in this tutorial and I
show you how well it works and on top of
everything primer smells so good I love
love love this stuff and I highly
recommend it to you the next thing out
of the bag is a new mascara from
covergirl this is the pump by pump of I
I think it's called pump of I blast pro
mascara now this one is waterproof and
it's supposed to create 50 times more
volume in your lashes which I always
need more volume so I do use this in the
tutorial and it looks like this the next
thing it came where I'm gonna kay
lipstick this one
in the shade turn on it is a gorgeous
very very pinky color it does have a
nice glossy finish and it is extremely a
pigmented so not sheer at all which I
think this lipstick with the gorgeous
for this look but I opted for the
Clinique one which was awesome in the
bag so this is another nice Clinique pop
lipstick this one is in the shade fab
pop these are so cute they're like
little babies this one is just a nice
soft pink is actually what I have on my
lips right now and you will see me use
this in the tutorial the last thing that
came in the bag was the Revlon Colorstay
this is the black liner I really like
this liner because it is very creamy and
is amazing for the waterline as well as
the top line I find that the more creamy
eyeliner the easier it is to top line
and whenever you talk on your upper
lashes you get a fuller lash effect so
the Revlon Colorstay is one of my
favorite jokes for mascaras out there
and lastly in the back in the L'Oreal
Paris infallible lip color in flamboyant
flamingo one side is a pigmented gloss
and the other side is a bomb to lock the
gloss in so it lasts for a very long
time also an amazing discount code I

video a thumbs up as well if you do
enjoy and we're gonna jump right into
the tutorial yeah so starting out this
tutorial like I said in the beginning
I'm gonna go in with the Lancome
visionary 1-minute blur primer I don't
apply this to areas that just need a
little bit more smoothing out just for a
flawless finish then I will go in with a
little bit of my Becca foundation and
apply this all over the face and then
I'll blend it out with a flat kabuki
just to get that nice move for lawless
finish
now we're gonna work on the eyes first
I'll go in with sherbert this is a nice
flat matte color it's very subtle very
creamy and I'm just gonna pop this into
the crease and basically all I'm doing
here is just softening up the eye primer
then I will go in with frappe by makeup
geek this is just a nice flat transition
shade I get the question all the time
what makes a good transition shade I
personally just like a neutral color
that is a matte just start off any of my
eye looks and frappe is a great one for
that next I'm gonna go in with a fawn
this is my honest Asha and I'm gonna
blend this into the crease you can
completely skip this step if you want to
because it really didn't make that much
of a difference I noticed after I did it
so you can leave this off if you want to
and then I'm gonna go in with one of my
favorite eye shadows this is cocoa bear
and this is a nice warm tone matte color
I think this I should have would go
great with any eye look it just warms it
up and gives your eyeball a little bit
of life I don't know if that makes any
sense
but I just feel like it gives it look so
much warmth and glow and beauty and I'm
just gonna blend that onto both eyes
obviously I don't know why I say both
eyes now I'm gonna go in with maje Tati
this is a duochrome
I should have a makeup geek and it kind
of has like a nice iridescent glow about
it and with a flat 58 brush I'm gonna
push this onto the lid and I'm not gonna
take it all the way to the outer corner
just like majority of the lid leaving at
that outer corner alone and I'm just
really pressing the color inward then
I'm gonna go in with that same 825 brush
in Americano which is just a matte brown
color and I'm going to push that only in
the outer corner and then I will take
whatever is left on the edge of my brush
and kind of sweep it inward to the
crease that way everything just flows
and is seamless and this is really gonna
smoke it out so then I want it to darken
it up a little bit so I'm gonna grab
that Maybelline the nudes palette and
take the black color and I'm just gonna
push that on the outer corner and this
is really really gonna give it that nice
now we're gonna wing it out with a
little bit of more people like gel liner
if you weren't comfortable with winged
liner all you have to do is simply draw
a black line on your upper lash line
just to define the eyes a wing is not
mandatory I just kind of like the way it
looks then I'm gonna go in with my Nora
creamy radiant concealer I'm gonna push
this into the skin and highlight my face
I added it in the usual areas that I do
in every tutorial so I thought we could
skip me applying it but then I'm just
gonna blend it out with this dome shape
kabuki and just make sure it is seamless
this is gonna cover any dark circles and
really brighten our face and of course
adding this much makeup you make sure
and set it with a little bit alarm RCA
translucent setting powder that way it
doesn't crease or fill any greasy it
just sticks to your skin at last and it
looks absolutely flawless now I'm gonna
go in with the Revlon Colorstay eyeliner
and I'm going to do the waterline like I
said in the beginning this is a very
creamy eyeliner so it's great for top
lining which will make your lashes look
even fuller I'm gonna be applying false
lashes in this tutorial but you don't
have to do that if you don't want to and
now for the palapa PHY mascara by
covergirl I'm gonna pump with my pump a
PHY my lashes I'm gonna add quite a few
coats of this to the lashes like I said
you can just build up your mascara if
you want to or you could pop onto
palsies whatever you're more comfortable
with and then I'm going to work on the
lower lash line taking cocoa bear and
blending it in and then I'm gonna take a
little bit of americano and swish it
across the lower lashes and going back
in with my mascara and I'm just gonna
add a few layers of this to the lower
lashes to make those look nice and long
and a little bit spidery now I'm going
to go in with my NARS bronzer this is in
Tahiti and I'm really just gonna bronze
up the skin we're not gonna do any
in-depth contouring here we just want to
look warm and we have a little bit of
color so I'm going to blend it on the
cheeks and the forehead and I did end up
going down the nose a little bit with it
then I'm going to take this a blush out
of the Gwen Stefani arbic a palette and
just pop a little on the cheeks and last
but not least for the face I'm gonna pop
on a little bit of a highlight by Laura
Geller and we're just gonna pop this on
the upper cheekbone then I'm gonna do
the lips you seen the Clinique's
fab pop lipstick this is such a cute
Barbie doll peak color
is a nice and moisturizing lipstick so
that completes this look thank you so
