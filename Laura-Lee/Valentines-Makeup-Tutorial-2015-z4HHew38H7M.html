to be a collab with two amazing girls
and I know them personally and I'll just
know them from YouTube like we friends
the first one is Ready Set glamour
Michelle and I know you guys are
probably very familiar with her for my
channel just because we are always

second one is Marella Belle beauty and I
met her at the NYX event she is such a
little tiny sweet sweet girl
they both are gonna be doing Valentine's
Day makeup tutorials they are super
talented with makeup so I can't wait for
you guys to see their makeup somewhere
else as well as mine they what their
videos will be linked down in the
description box if you're interested in
checking that out just be sure to click
that down bar and love both of the girls
to death they're amazing youtubers they
both are just the sweetest people in the
world hope you guys enjoy we're gonna
jump right in and I'll see you very soon
first as usual we're going to be priming
our skin this is prepping it for the
foundation and this is also gonna help
our foundation to sit on our face and
look for losses next we're gonna go in
with the new nerves luminous foundation
I have a full review on this if you want
to check that out I'm just gonna use my
flat top kabuki brush just spread that
evenly all over my skin I love this
foundation just FYI look at that serious
coverage I know my faces pill but I
promise it will match my neck then I'm
going to start by blending in the crease
as my transition shade make it Peaks
orange smoothie I'm using a big fat
fluffy blending brush this is just gonna
help us blend out all the colors as you
can see it doesn't really show up much
then for my more PB 35 palette I want to
be taking this peachy pink color is a
really light color I'm gonna be working
that into the crease I'm targeting the
crease area and making sure not to bring
it down to the lid I do this on purpose
and I take a lot of time blending out on
this mega tutorial because I want this
look to be extremely soft
then I'm gonna just take a little bit
deeper pink color and I'm gonna work
that in this is a new brush for me it is
the 54 by Sigma and I'm kind of obsessed
with it I'm using it to place the color
right on top of that lighter color that
we use and then I'm gonna go back in
later and blend it all out so basically
just as you can see I have a little bit
of color on the tip of my brush and I'm
just working it right on the crease
being sure not to bring it down into my
lid and now I'm using that 825 brush
from Sigma and I'm just gonna blend it
all out because again we want everything
to be soft and smooth then taking this
girl-talk shimmery color from NYX wonder
new eyeshadows I'm gonna pack this onto
the lid this is a really pigmented I was
really impressed with it I don't take it
all the way out to the outer corner I
basically just work it on to the inner
corner of the lid to about the middle
then going in with makeup peeks bitten
I'm gonna work this on that outer V of
the eye basically making a sideways beat
because you're gonna see I'm gonna work
it in that outer corner right there so
taking it a little bit in the crease and
then bringing it down to the outer
corner it's gonna give us that soft
gradient fill and I'm using that 54
brush by Sigma again and then again I'm
gonna go in and blend it out like it
sounds just using that brush to place
the color where I want it and then I'm
just using my blending brush to make
sure everything is really soft and
really smooth then of course when I take
a lighter shade to lighten our brow bone
I do this in every tutorial I think it's
really important to highlight your brow
bone with any bright shade now I'm gonna
wing it out for those of you don't
carefully liner or you don't like doing
it on yourself simply create just a
black line on your upper lash line there
this is just gonna help define the eyes
me I like a little bit of drama so I'm
gonna go ahead and wing it out I love
one-liner and I'm using my cheat NYC a
liquid liner that stuff is Bob calm now
use my NARS concealer we're gonna
brighten up that face and then I'm gonna
go in with my highlight or pimp come
back and we're gonna highlight the face
because this is kind of a date night
timeless and I do a little bit of heavy
face makeup but not too heavy but I want
to look really bright and happy because
it is Valentine's Day then I'm gonna
buffer it all out as you can see I'm
doing a patting motion instead of
swiping motion because I have placed the
concealer in a strategic area and I
don't want to move it around too much
because I want particular areas to be
brightened not the whole entire face
using the same brush I did my foundation
with it's just a flat top kabuki brush
you could even use your fingers for this
part if you wanted to
now I'm gonna set everything I am using
my banana powder or what's left of it
from my Anastasia contour kit I'm just
packing that on where I place the
highlight then I'm going to bronze up my
face using the new Argan bronzer from
Physicians Formula I'm just gonna hit
that cheekbone area around the temples
bringing her on the forehead and just
warm up my whole face didn't really
choose to contour on this one I just
want to look warm and fresh and I also
do a little bit on the nose just because
Philip my nose needs a little bit of
structure today and it just completes
the bronze look now going in with the
new color pop blushes only go up a
little so much and guess what guys they
are released today they are $8 a piece
I'll link them down below if you're
interested there's four different shades
then I'm gonna highlight I want to look
bright like I said before so we're gonna
add at Becca opal which is my favorite
highlight now we're gonna work on that
lower lash line we're taking the
lightest pink color we're gonna smooth
that around
we're definitely gonna take our time
blending that on the lower lash line and
then I'm going with the second pink
color we use and I'll pop that right on
top and then lastly I'm gonna go in with
bitten by makeup geek and I'm gonna pop
that right switch the lower lash line
now we're gonna fill in with our wire
line with a little bit of black eyeliner
you can use a lighter color liner if you
choose but as for me I want it to have
defined eyes I'm gonna pop on a few
coats of mascara and then I'm gonna add
false lashes if you're not comfortable
with false lashes like I always say
simply build up your mascara and leave
it at that I think it'll be beautiful
for this look but I'm a drama queen so
I'm gonna add these la mink mink lashes
I love them for this
because they're just really fluttery and
girly and it's very feminine girly girly
look for my lips I'm gonna go in with
Max or and honestly at first I didn't
add the melted lip on top but I decided
my lips were a little bit too dark for
this look look and then I just went in
and added that peony melted lip color
from Too Faced right on top and it just
lightened up sore a little bit and made
it a perfect dull
