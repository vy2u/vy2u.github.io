today's video is going to be this makeup
look which is my first fault eye makeup
look I'm sure there'll be many more but
we are kicking off with a super baby lip
this tutorial it's a collab with my oh

eye makeup tutorial as well and it will

subscribe to her show her some love
while you're over there and we're gonna
jump right in this tutorial and get
started kicking the story off with a
little bit of one of my favorite pace
primers this was the pore-minimizing one
by Smashbox and this works really well
just has smooth out the skin and then we
will apply our foundation on top using
the hello flawless oxygen Wow foundation
with my f88 kabuki from sigma sigma
beauty hello i'm just gonna dab this out
all over my skin this is a lightweight
foundation that allows my skin to
breathe so i've been enjoying it these
past few days i'm just trying it out
it's an oldie but a goodie and I'm just
now getting back to it and by the way I
am in shade beige
next going in with a 35o palette from
morphe I'm going to take this brown /
orange warm tone color in a e-40 brush
from Sigma I want to blend this all in
the crease this is gonna help be our
transition shade and soften up that
primer that I have on my eyelids which
is Mac's Paint Pot in soft ochre then
I'm gonna warm it up a little bit more
with this orange e tone color this
reminds me so much of chickadee by
makeup geek this particular color I want
to blend this in the crease with the e38
brush from Sigma same brush just a
little bit of a smaller blending brush
so if you have a smaller eyelid I
recommend buying the e 38 versus the e
40 by Sigma I'm gonna take my time
blending that right on top of the other
shade just to give us a gradient fill
and to warm up the look a little bit
then going in with my e25 brush from
sigma one of my favorite brushes I'm
gonna take this warm tone brown color
which reminds me so much a cocoa bear by
makeup geek or Brown script by Mac I'm
giving you other options because this
palette is sold out right now and I
didn't realize that when I filled the
tutorial and now I feel bad but these
colors are pretty neutral so they're
pretty easy to find I'm gonna focus this
right on the crease mainly the outer
crease area then I'm gonna go in with a
shader brush this is the e 50 a purse
from Sigma I'm gonna grab this beautiful
absolutely stunning shade of the pallet
is a very light shimmer shimmer shimmery
color I did wet this with a little bit
of mac fix+ bright if you don't have
that on hand you can use some water to
wet it it just helps the pigment to show
up better and to pack on heavier then
going back in with that 825 brush from
Sigma I'm gonna take this matte dark
brown color and I'm gonna start to blend
it on the outer edge of the eye as you
can see I'm trying to create kind of
like a circular round motion right there
and give us a gradient fill I'm going in
with a super light hand here and this is
just really gonna help everything to
blend out softer and not to be so heavy
and not to mush the colors and move
around too much because I've
strategically placed them on my eyelid
then going in with a little makeup wipe
I'm going to clean off the edges yes it
takes a little bit of the foundation off
but that's okay cuz we'll clean that up
and fix it with the concealer then going
in with some of this delay
mascara basically I'm just giving my
lashes like one or two coats because I'm
gonna be doing false lashes which I do
recommend for this look I don't
typically recommend false lashes but I
just think they'd be really pretty
these are by USC ito I'll have them
listed down below because I can't
remember the exact name of them off the
top of my head then I applied those and
next I'll go in with my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer I haven't broke this out in a
long time but this isn't NCS xxx so it
is a little bit of a warmer color just
because it's the 30 and not the 20 I
used to use the 20 and now I use the 30
and it looks better to me not so white
then I am going to add my Laura Mercier
translucent powder on top to set it I
really like this translucent powder to
avoid the creasing making the concealer
last longer and you won't get that flash
back with a camera with this one so if
you're looking for a good one
that won't flash and give you the funny
look with the camera and pictures try
that one out
nice going in with my G way I shadow and
chestnut look how beautiful Shay this is
to contour your face with I mean it is
just like the perfect cool town brown
color to contour with so yes this is an
eyeshadow but it works great as a
bronzer guys always improvising your
makeup and play around in experiments
young halls so that I'm just gonna grab
this ether t-9 brush this is I should
have brush from Sigma and contour my
nose I'm breaking all kinds of rules
today this brush that is super fluffy
and noticeable is the number 8 brush
from it cosmetics and monogram moko
which is a beautiful mauve blush from
Mac and pop that onto the apples of my
cheeks taking my busted Becca cosmetics
opal I'm gonna pop that onto the high
points on the cheeks and run a little
bit down the center of the nose to give
us a nice finish and a nice little glowy
doing this then I'm going to pop a
little bit that shimmery color right
into the corners of my eyes it's gonna
widen our eyes and just make us look so
fresh face and awake then I'll grab a
little bit of that warmth home brown
color that we used on the crease I'm
gonna pop that onto the lower lash line
to smoke it out a little bit
going in with tarts and a rim liner I'm
going to widen the eyes that with
applying this in the waterline
and then I'm going to add just a little
bit of mascara to the lower lashes just
giving those a few coats being sure not
to touch the lower lash line lastly I'm
going to finish off this look with the
most beautiful lip color this is Menna
mi na by Ophir cosmetics I have truly
fallen in love with this lip color and I
didn't see that it feathered or bled so
I didn't do a lip liner with it it was
okay on its own I hope you guys enjoyed

leave and I'll see you all in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
