video is going to be a big ol Victoria
Secret hub because I went shopping for
their semi-annual sell which is one of
the happiest times of the year because I
love Victoria Secret as does most girls
well a lot of girls do just have so much
good pink beautiful things in that store
and I never can help myself especially
whenever the semi-annual sell comes
around so I'm going to share with you
all the goodies that I got I can't wait
for you guys to see the video if you
like it you already know what to do
give her a good old thumbs up we're
gonna jump right in the gold pink bag
after we go through all the issues right
now first I just want to share with you
I guess the bras that I got since their
setting on top the first bra that I got
well this is stupid because it wasn't
even on sale you guys are like wah wah
well that's exactly what I was like
because it was in the sell bin and I
feel like 50% of the stuff in the Silvan
is not actually on sell because people
just throw stuff in there while they're
shopping you know how that goes I'm so
sold on it after I saw it in the sell
bin and felt the nationís the nosh her
and felt a nice cushioning in it and
then this part right here is like that
sticky rubbery material because it can
be a strapless bra
I was so sold on this bra and then
whenever I found out it wasn't on sale I
was like just give it to me I bought it
anyways and I have it I wore it one day
and it actually wears really great this
is the for those of you wondering it
doesn't even say oh yeah this is a very
sexy multi way multi top tations a bra
and the girl told me that this is one of
the most popular bras and she doubts it
will ever go on sale so I was like thank
you for letting me know that hmm I got
it in white because I have nude and
black brawls already which leads me to
my next purchase which was on sale a
black bra I love black bras I don't know
why I just - okay this one has no
padding in it and it's like super flimsy
and I love it I got it for like sixteen
dollars which is the hell of a deal
and this one is the no wire saying I
mature no this is just the no wire I
think the other part is in another
language that I just try to reteach this
is a 32 C and O too small and the cup
size and I don't know why because I'm
always a SIA victoria's secret but this
one was just a little squishy squishy to
my girls but that's okay I'm gonna wear
it anyways it feels so comfortable and I
think this is just one of those great
bras for like whenever you're in between
where you don't wanna put on a sports
bra because you're actually wearing like
a nice top and then you don't want to
put on like a push-up bra be
uncomfortable all day so I feel like
this is that bra for that kind of day
it's just like that perfect in-between
sports bra push-up bra you and I'm
saying that is all the bras that I
bought I do believe the next thing I
purchased is the big bottle of the
Victoria's Secret dark angel perfume so
it says no ordinary angel almond flower
mango nectar caramel latte excuse me it
was originally $52 and I got it for 50%
off the box - it is just fabulous it's
covered in black glitter I'll throw the
Box away I used to be a box keeper -
gonna you guys do that like keep the
nice boxes to makeup and perfumes but I
don't do that anymore
okay oh no this is not good in the store
they had like a sample sitting in front
of them gonna ask the girl because it
just said bit Chris Secret Angel on this
on the sample one and I asked the girl I
said is this the Dark Angel because it
smells good and she was like yeah that
most definitely was not Dark Angel that
bottle was not black and did not have
wings on it so thanks a lot
now let's find out what Dark Angel
smells like I hope I like it
during angel smells pretty good I feel
like I like the sample one that I was
smelling earlier but Dark Angel smells
pretty good and I'm still happy I bought
it I wish I had bought the one that was
the sample one that one smelled really
really good I have no idea what it was I
thought it was dark angel um that's so
weird that she would tell me that was
dark angel whenever the actual dark
angel has wings on it and it's a black
bottle that was like a pink I don't know
what I smelled anyways it smells really
good I'm happy I bought it and it is a
nice sized bottle for the price that I
got so yeah my sister so crazy she'll
like put bottles like this in her purse
um I do you have any perfume yeah I'm
like cool other Chanel bottle or
something I'm like that's supposed to be
at home on your dresser the next thing
that I picked up oh these were so cute I
got these for 35 bucks and they were
originally $56 these are they're the
ultimate pink irreversible leggings what
oh my god there were no way these are
not reversible
he says reversible reversible oh my god
shut up shut up they say pink on the leg
- how cute is that this was like cotton
candy tie-dye and I got a shirt to match
it I'll show you in just a second this
shirt was not on sale but how can I not
get the matching shirt okay so it is
reversible I guess and the other side is
just plain grey yeah so I can wear these
pants for like three days in a row no no
no and then they have the little pocket
for your credit cards for a while you
work out but we all know I'm not going
to wear these to work out moving on okay
here's the thing
I got three pairs of hands and I lost
one of them already I wore them for like
a split second and now we're gone I
checked my washer I checked the folded
clothes I checked out my drawers I
checked my closet I checked my bathroom
wherever I leave a lot of dirty clothes
and I don't know I'm telling you all
that and I can't find them anywhere but
the pants that the other pair of pants I
bought are just like these is that four
they say pink all the way down the side
of the legs so they say it for $35 - and
these are the pink ultimate yoga pants
most comfortable pants have ever put on
my - hoody that
are loose they're not legging so they're
not tight at all they like joggers and
then the bottom is cuff so it fits
nicely and I think that tennis shoes
look nice whenever your pants are tight
around the ankle make sure ten shoes
look cuter whenever you air with them so
I'm always looking for this in my pants
that I buy especially like comfy pants
because I normally will wear my tennis
shoes with my comfy pants to have that
tight ankle but anyways I got two pair
of these who are 35 bucks each and then
they had the second one just had pink
down the legging and then these have
pink on the inside and the other ones
did not have pink on the inside
and then I wanted to show you guys the
shirt that I had to get because it
matched the cotton candy pants we got a
lot going on over here this is the shirt
that matches the pant will I wear them
together probably not because I am NOT a
matching matchy girl but anyway this is
what the shirt looks like is very cute I
hope my lights are not too bright but
where you're seeing it looks faded in
the viewfinder that's actually like a
powder blue and then all down the long
sleeve it just says pink and it's a
little tacky but I think it's going to
be super cute whatever the plain black
pants and then the sleeve is like a
jersey gray it's a very soft shirt I did
pay thirty two dollars for the shirt
which is about what I paid for the pants
which doesn't make that much sense but
I'm okay with it because I got so many
such great deals the next thing that I
got is and one of these sure I said I
wanted to say another way they show us
because I have this shirt and baby blue
and I paid full price for it
this is 34 dollars but I got it for
16.99 so like half off and then this is
like a neon orange cone like road cone
shirt so if I ever go out at night and
don't want to get ran over I'll probably
opt to wearing this shirt and then on
the back it just says pink and white
super cute and then it has a pocket on
the front now these shirts are oversized
so I'm meant to be kind of oversized and
like hang below and be kind of sloppy if
you will looking they're just really
comfortable I don't particularly wear
these out anywhere I wear these around
the house but they're very soft material
in there
very comfortable this is a nice
oversized shirt I got an extra small
which it still looks humongous but I
love that about it and my other was a
small I would have got a small in it but
they ran out I only had extra smalls
left story finally lastly I got two
sweatshirts and these are shirts that
teller actually ordered for me off line
because he knew how much I love them and
he likes surprise me with them um and
what better gift to be surprised with in
a Victoria Secret pink sweatshirt the
first one well they're like the exact
same sweatshirt but different colors
the first one is white and it has a
silver doggie on it and then in the back
look how cute that is I am obsessed with
this pattern and I did wear it out and I
got like a lot of compliments I was like
thank you I will let you know he bought
these offline very recently but I did
see them in store as well so and then I
got the blue one and it is a silver dog
sometimes it was that Yoshi times I wish
that it was a cat instead of a dog logo
but that's just me in the back of it
again is the exact same
it's so cute so much and these again are
oversized big I got a size small but
they're like really big that love that
about I'm so comfortable and they look
really cute with like leggings or
whatever so I got these and that is it
for this haul video I hope you guys
enjoyed it didn't seem like I got that
much oh and you want to know what really
sucked I went there and I was getting
ready to check out and I had a gift card
and I left a gift card at home I bought
this stuff anyways because I was like
what are the chances I'll be back oh you

those of you who say to the very end of
the video I am wearing the Lolita 2 on
my lips by Kat Von D this is the liquid
lipstick I camera battery is dying cats
