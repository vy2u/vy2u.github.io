video is going to be on this bronzing
makeup look this is a snazzy little look
that I put together here and I think
it's really pretty and bronzy and smoky
and to change the look I use the NARS
loaded eyeshadow palette this is a
limited edition eyeshadow palette it
comes with a 12 velvety eyeshadow shades
and get quite the variety of shade in
this palette you get matte shimmer satin
Sparkle I chose they're just so velvety
soft very highly pigmented it and so
easy to work with
hi there are few swatches of the palette
they are so pretty just you can get an
idea their pigmentation may be a little
bit more calm in this video because I
was trying to do a more in-depth
tutorial I asked you guys my previous
video do you like more in-depth
tutorials or do you like more talk
through tutorials and white denim in
cases or more voiceover quick tutorials
and all of you guys I don't think one
person said they'd like some voiceovers
everybody said they want a more in-depth
tutorial where I talk more about my
application and makeup so it's more of a
learning experience so I do that in this
video and I hope you guys enjoy that a
nice child I think that's all that we
got today so be sure and subscribe to my
channel
oh yeah leave and let's jump right in
and blend up some eyeshadow okay
starting out I'm going to go in with a
little bit of my Revlon so DeRay I said
that wrong everyone said already it's
respecting primer and my voice a little
ugh it's because I just woke up and it's
just a little scratchy so I just get
like a little pea-sized amount I just
like to really rub this in areas that
the pore is more prominent because you
don't really need it
coding your whole entire base per say
that's I'm going to be going in with one
of my current favorite drugstore
foundations this is the wet and wild
foundation and this one is in shade
green beige you can never remember the
shades off the top of my head now the
smells of foundation is not all that you
know everybody that gets it complaints
also smell but the foundation is good
you guys already know abreast I'm going
to be using it is the y6
I'm also I use this in every little toot
you know the drill
if you see little specks a glitter on me
just know that I filmed a video on
Jeffrey's channel involving glitter and
it's probably going to haunt me for a
while for concealer I'm going to be
going in with a little bit as the LA
girl this is their Pro concealer in
shade natural with a y11 brush I'm just
going to start tapping all that product
out I really like to do this stippling
wish whenever I'm having out my
concealer because over we do not want
streaks in the makeup and it's health
services brush Street one is my camera
feature and I go out of focus it needs
to settle down and I typically do my
nose my fingers so I'm disperse the
product everywhere and it kind of stays
like all my nose it's not all nothing
okay my morphe 9c palette this is a good
little contour kit and I'm going to set
everything with this banana shade and
then I'm going to bronze up my skin with
this shade right here the in super dry
skin sometimes a pressed powder is a
little less drying and going in with
like a loose powder because I no loose
powders just like absorb everything and
leave your skin feeling really tight and
dry
whereas pressed powders are a little
less aggressive of the setting powder so
you might like the press powders better
if you have oily skin you probably like
the loose powders a lot because they do
is orb a lot of excess oils and things
like that whereas my contour I mean I'm
just going to bronze with my skin I'm
not really wanting to do like that tight
structure cheekbone today sometimes I do
too some days I don't but today I'm just
like feeling like Bronson up my skin
giving me a little toasty glow go ahead
and bring it with that glitter I see you
you see how it's like not super
structured and like cut out it's more so
just like warmed up the area and like
what kind of bronze it's like to go in
and be a little extra and just sprinkle
some on my nose and Posie what are we
taking in our jizz orgasm this is
actually a duo with hot sand highlighter
and then orgasm blush but today we're
using all guys well I'm using this shade
of blush since I started my channel if
you actually watch
video that I ever posted on YouTube I
took the orgasm blush NARS and I used it
and that's funny and Here I am four
years later all right
Fars highlighter I'm going to be using
am a nice collaboration with Jeffrey
star the Eclipse skin frost highlighter
I'm going to be taking our whiteboard
Wyatt 14 brush some ball say across my
skin you know a little highlight and
then we'll be right on to the eyes we're
just going to dust it on the cheek ball
I try not to take my highlights too far
forward because I find that they pick up
texture obviously their shimmer and girl
we want as little textures we can get I
always do my nose with my fingers so
it's a little more controlled okay let's
move on to the eye so exciting stuff
unreasoned is narcissus loaded palette
this is a pretty neutral eyeshadow
palette this is a limited edition
palette and it's got this pretty golden
mirror on front and then you have a
bunch of pretty shade first and I go
into the shade Windsor and what I like
to do which is like this is just kind of
on my hands let them all over so it's
awesome stuff the eyeshadow primer and
then that way the other colors don't
stick too hard and they blend out really
easy I'm not one who ever stand how to
pronounce this names I want to put the
text on the screen but it is a peach
matte shade that maybe blending in the
crease really is a great color to warm
up the look and I'm just going to take
that all the way from outer or inner I'm
sorry inner to a hover corner and just
start blending it back and forth and
this color really does show up obviously
you can see as a lot of pigment to it so
it looks really light in the packaging
but once you blend it on it's like a
very beautiful toasty warm color there
can I take this brown shade right here
the same brush I'm just building up
color I'm going to pop it right in that
outer corner and just make sure I'm
swiveling like that sound effect so the
best way to describe makeup application
on my channel you know that's what I
believe in going in the inner corner and
doing the same thing just whistling it
around and then bringing it back around
and do it again to make sure everything
is blended out super soft because I
definitely don't want any harsh lines
and
a little technique right here always
watch something FINA to get that soft
smooth gradient fill fountain a tape is
pretty bronze color and I am going to
focus it right there on the lid such
pretty color and if you notice I kept
the color in the middle of the lid and
didn't really take it all the way in the
inner corner or all the way in the outer
corner I just come as Center to it right
there and you'll see me darken it up in
a second this dark brown color I'm going
to use this with a smaller brush and
we're going to pop it in the outer
corner this is very pigmented so just
try to pick up a smaller amount of
pigment with the brush and we're going
to focus that right there in the outer
corner I'm going to buff out that edge
where the bronze was that way it doesn't
look harsh is really gradient and girl
it will be looking smooth just small
little baby strokes the darker the color
the lower I like to keep it honey and
that will give you like a controlled
smoky eye a controlled smoke yeah and
then I'm going it to take a little bit
on the inner corner as well and I'm just
going to do the tiny little motions
because I don't want to drag it all the
way down here you know I want to keep it
right up in here now I'm going to go
back in with the warmer brown color that
we use and we're going to take it and
just swish it on the lower lash line you
don't want to take your lower lash line
colors to look so I like to use flat
little brushes so it's more controlled
and then you can get the color more in
specific areas rather than blowing it
out on your under eyes it can really
drag the eye down if you take dark
colors and like it explodes everywhere
it's happened to me so many times and
just know I'm a girl and makeup that
learn has learned from her mistakes you
know you can stock me on Instagram and
go back to my older stuff and you'll
bill yes
she learned I'm going to go back in with
the dark brown color that was using and
I'm just going to tech take it really
close to the lower lash line and I am
NOT going to take it all the way in and
take it about half way in right there
and then just stop and just connect it
right down the outer corners buffing
that in I add okay heya
are you doing add it some lashes and
some eyebrows on and now we're going to
finish up the look I'm going to take
celebrity skin from jeffree star
cosmetics and apply this all over my
lips you can leave your lips like that
or add a little bit of a mannequin and
then I like to just take the brush and
like to pull out the edges right here so
that's it for this video guys I hope you

loaded palette from NARS remember it is
limited edition and I'll have everything
