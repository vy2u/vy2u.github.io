this is the second time I've done this
intro because my microphone was an
unformed in filming and then it just
anyways today's the day was going to be
me testing out a bunch of weird products
that I found on a lot on Facebook ads
and Instagram ads I don't know what it
is but they love to advertise some weird
funky stuff gimmicks per se and so I'm
gonna be testing them out to see if
they're worth your money or if they're
just straight up a gimmick and you don't
need to waste your time on them so
that's what today's video is about I've
done these videos in the past but it's
been a long long time since I've done
one of these videos so I hope you guys
are excited to see it today also if you
aren't following me on my lolli Los
Angeles brand page be sure and do so
because I'm giving away 10 cat's pajama
palette
be sure and go enter that giveaway girl
there's ten with us ten anyways without
further ado we're gonna sing the
SUBSCRIBE song and you know the routine
they were gonna jump right into the
video
I wonder if someone's new here they're
just like what is she doing see Sharon
subscribe to my channel yeah and now we
can go ahead and jump right into
for the product I have a bone to pick
with Facebook Ads because this is it is
this super BB cream and is a it now you
see it might have been used and that's
because I was gonna film a dedicated
video on it but the product I started
like looking up the actual brand because
I bought it straight off the ad without
going to the actual website because you
can do that and it's like encouraged on
the Facebook ad things be careful doing
that for warning right here because this
is actually a brightening cream and it
doesn't say that anywhere on the ad and
I bought three different shades in it
and they look on the website nothing
like this the shades the shades looks
super tan like skin tone and then I went
to the website to read about it before I
filmed a video on it and it shows that
this is actually a whitening product and
I just think that if you're advertising
cool videos and this going on people's
skin really tan then maybe you should
say that it's a whitening product in the
ad but I feel like they would probably
lose themselves if they did that so they
got me they got me buying this product
and it's a gimmick now if you're into a
whitening cream then this is great for
you you might like it but it's not what
I was looking for it looked like a great
BB cream and it did not advertise any
shade like this although all three of
like the five shades I bought are this
color so I'm just go on back fold over
here anyways it's really cool it's like
roll-on this could have been such a cool
product but you know what
it's a flippity-flop look at this go at
what world just doing the trash so I
wish it would have worked I think it
could have been a really cool BB cream
product and like a cool way to apply it
but it's a gimmick so our first product
I'm just gonna go ahead and put out
there be careful those Facebook ads
that's a waste of money especially
because I bought more than one because I
was gonna film with it show you guys
it's the different shades
although the shades are pretty much all
the same now I know if I had a zoom you
in for this next one
and hmm you guys are way too close my
face okay this next one you probably
have seen go viral on Instagram I got so
many requests to try this product out so
I'm going to these are the eyebrow
extensions by really I don't know if you
guys have seen the app but it came in
this box it came really really weird the
box was like open its 3d eyebrow fibers
and then the instructions are taped on
the back which are super simple see
they're just like stuck on the I don't
know it's weird
it's a weird situation apparently this
is a Japanese brand so it comes like
this I had to put it back together cuz I
was taking a peek at it but the bra
extensions are down in the bottom and
then the top comes with a little brush I
think I could be a really good good
candidate for this product because I'm
missing hairs author here all through
here and right here on my brows it looks
so nasty oh my god guys it looks like
Brown mold tell me that look at the lid
it looks like black mold I should say
tell me that doesn't like mold oh it
smells like it smells like hair gel
wonder if that's just literally hair gel
with little fibers in it okay so on the
instructions it says to apply some on
the back of your hand make sure your
brows are clean and started to paint it
onto your brows really simple
instructions I don't know what it's so
nasty like filling about this but
something about this just feels
straight-up nice tea oh okay we're gonna
put these on our eyebrows I'm so scooped
up some okay here I go
look at that it hurts it hurts to even
look at it don't even look at it it just
hurts me oh my gosh I hope they don't
dry this shiny but I'm patching the gels
really shiny I mean like that don't look
good right if I'm supposed to place each
individual hair then girl I'm Way better
off just drawing in my eyebrows you know
because this will take me three and a
half years the hairs are kind of sort of
hard to pick up with with the brush and
then the gel kind of makes them move
around a lot brows I'm always dreamed of
I'm even wasn't those shiny and all the
hairs I can get them to go the same way
it might be better but I promise this
brush is not that easy to work with cuz
see if you start to move them without if
you don't pat them then they just move
away if you try to swipe and the only
way to get them to go the same
directions is swiping them so let's just
go ahead and put some over here shall we
guys I'm gonna go ahead and call this a
gimmick I mean I see how it could be
good but I just think the product needs
to be better perfect it may be with a
better solution with the hairs and maybe
a better tool to apply the hairs and if
it's this much work to get my brows like
this crazy then hope this washes off I
really don't want this on my brows for
like three days or something like that
I'm pretty sure I look insane right now
okay very cool our next product is a
lipstick that we're gonna try out and
I'm gonna leave these brows on to
distract you the whole entire time
okay this lipstick is a jelly lipstick
and it's also a nourishing lipstick and
it's really beautiful so this is what it
looks like it's seeped through and it's
gotten golden sparkles in it and this
really ugly sticker stuck on it the
sticker stuck on it cuz I bought it from
Amazon and a lot of times stuff comes in
with random stickers on it I want to try
it and then I want to chop it in half
and see what's inside of it that's what
we're doing today my god
it tastes citrusy it was really pretty
this is really pretty it's turning pink
it's like a little lip stain and it
smells pretty good oh my gosh I love
this okay girl my lips Oh turn it hi I
just want to cut this in half to see
what's in it
oh there's like nothing in it squeeze it
oh my gosh we're just getting weird now
yeah nothing feels like jelly but look
how it's turning me all pink oh my gosh
look my lips oh my gosh oh my gosh look
my lips whoa they just turned so hot
pink color changing much and it's like
stained all over my hands oh my gosh lip
stain okay well it works and it's really
cool and if you cut it up nothing
happens so that one's not a gimmick okay
next product I got is finger pen makeup
and tell me how strange these are
they're little makeup pins and they come
in different colors and you can use them
as eyeshadows lips blush whatever you
want to use them as they're just pigment
for your face I got these off Amazon and
I'm excited to try them out so you open
them and they have a little sponge tip
so and then it has a little clicker
where you click the product down which
is probably gonna take a minute to get
going so I'll go ahead and start
clicking I'm gonna apply this one to my
eyelid see swear guys it stains my
eyelids guys it's blending out very
nicely but feels a little wet oh it
blends out into like dryness there's not
too - damn it counts like I have a rash
on my eye but that's because of the
color but they actually blend it out
nicely like my eye meets a little bit of
cortisone cream you know but
it did what it said it was gonna do okay
so I have different ones and I want to
try them out next up I have a pink a
more pink one gonna add a little bit to
the cheeky Leakey's whoo this one feels
like velvet oh shoot Shh there you go
you're just gonna really work it in but
this is just crazy okay well I don't
what is happening to me girl Oh soon
help okay we have a light pink one
coming through so I think this one will
be a good candidate for our lips
this one actually smells pretty good it
smells like cotton candy and the sponge
applicators are really soft the color is
just terrible I think this one would
have been way better for the cheeks see
there yeah I just guys I don't know I
just think that these are strange the
only thing is if you got a color besides
Raschi red here I got this one this
orange one we'll try like see that's
pretty on the lips it just depends on
what you like I personally won't use
these you know it's all about what you
like what you're gonna actually use if
it's worth your money like I said I'm
off Amazon I can't believe I'm talking
to you guys seriously looking like this
we have one more product to test okay
next up I have from glitter injections
these are a like goo highlighter you
guys can see it's like in a little glass
pot and they're just glitter honestly I
didn't mean to say hi Lana
it's like glitter goo it's really pretty
on the back of the hand so I'm gonna try
some of my cheeks in look at those
little hairs left over for my brows so
I'm gonna wipe it on the back of my hand
first
not a lie that's pretty cool it's like a
simple way to add glitter well I
definitely don't hate it okay let's ask
them to the chi-chi's Wow look at that
and then there whoa that's cool wow this
is really pretty
oh my gosh
glitter is really beautiful okay well if
you need glitter on your face this is
just the way to do it look at that
pretty okay

test out some products and I look like
an insane person right now but I love
