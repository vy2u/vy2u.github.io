today this video is going to be me
showing you guys some of my literally
these are my favorite drugstore and
high-end very full coverage foundations
meaning these couple these foundations
are the best of the best but they
provide the most coverage like Epperly
these are super full coverage I'm a full
coverage girl I love like the fools to
full coverage personally if you don't
like that I have other videos using
foundations that aren't so full coverage
but girl I just love the trick with the
felt full coverage foundation is that it
has to wear well all day long because
you know heavy makeup can slip and stuff
around and start to look really bad
so these foundations not only look good
but they wear very well throughout the
day and some of them are newer
foundations that have just launched now
really haven't had a chance to talk that
much about so also being one of them is
the brand new super safe full coverage
foundation from Maybelline if you hang
out towards the end of the video I will
show you I will apply that to my skin
and show you guys how it looks on the
skin is become one of my favorites very
quickly but I haven't really used it on
my channel so I think that that is
important and I want to show you guys
how it looks on the skin so hang out to
the end of the video you know we can
just hang out together all day long okay
so that is all for the intro I'm gonna
sing the SUBSCRIBE song and then we're
gonna jump right into the video
yeah and now let's go ahead and drab
right into the video
it's gonna be a little chitchat video
you know we're gonna chat together I
think I'll start I'll go back and forth
high-end drug store high-end drug store
first we're gonna start off with da okay
let's start off with the drugstore so
Revlon Photoready insta-fix stick is a
really amazing foundation in the
drugstore I don't think it's talked
about that much um it's not a very
popular one but I think it is somewhat
of a dupe for the Bobbi Brown stick
foundation both foundations are great
both are very long wearing and this one
to me has a very matte finish and it is
thick Hana Hana Hana you can barely see
this one cuz it's so my skin shade but
it is thick thick thick and it is so
nice what I like about this one is very
I'm shade 170 golden beige by the way
but what I like about this one is that
it's very long wearing like this what
you can wear to the cows come home
like adheres to your skin it is a little
bit tough to blend out you kind of got
to work it in I prefer using a brush
with there something a little more dense
than a Beauty Blender with it just
because it is a thicker foundation it
wears beautifully I just set it with a
powder and girl I'm ready to go very
full coverage at an affordable price so
that is the Revlon Photoready insta-fix
stick beautiful and the shade that has
that shades very nice very nice this new
one okay so I tried out the new NARS
radiant long wear foundation I had heard
so many amazing things about this
foundation so I went in with very high
hopes testing it out and I tested out a
YouTube video and oh my boo goalies it
was so beautiful and sofa cover so the
thing I really like about this
foundation is how lightweight it is have
you ever tried a full coverage
foundation and it feels like you're
wearing Mount Everest on your face it's
like you want that coverage but you
don't want to feel like you're wearing
that much coverage this is that it is
very long wearing now I will tell you
have all these skin you're gonna look a
little shiny with this foundation it has
like this radiant dewy glow to it I
personally like I'm a little bit combo
right in here
can you guys already see this
coming through oh yeah Olli and I get
Olli right here with this foundation I
do get a little shiny but I think it
looks sexy and I think it looks really
beautiful to have that little bit of do
and really natural and it kyles like
your skin showing through your makeup
really it's just your old I love this
stuff it's great it's gonna become a
holy grail of mine I've only used it
like five times but all five times just
been pure happiness with it so it's
great I really recommend it to you in
the shade I've been using is in point
three five okay let's talk about like
the world's thickest drugstore
foundation that ever existed this is the
stay matte from Rimmel and I used to
wear this and like I think I was in
junior high like I think that's how old
it is I might be wrong and maybe high
school that I wore this girl this stuff
is so full coverage I mean my friend was
wearing this and she was like at work
and her face got soaking wet at work she
ordered a ghost or I care exactly what
happened and that story sounds weird but
I remember her saying the water just
like beaded off her face and like it
didn't even touch the foundation because
the foundation is so like Shh tough and
really full-coverage so this does feel a
little bit heavier I will admit on the
skin here is a swatch of it it's quite
thick and that's just a little dot and
if you can see like how thick it is
kinda has a whippy feel to it this one
too adheres to the skin as well as the
stick foundation and they're more hard
to get off which is good because it's
very long wearing but it feels a little
bit heavier but overall I like the
foundation a lot I think it's a good one
and Rimmel is a super super affordable
brand at the drugstore it's like I had
the drugstore title Orioles are a little
bit more and then like the Rimmel
wedding walls or like the low-low and
the elf so I think that one's really
affordable and a great price for such a
full coverage product that lasts a
really long time all right next up is
another new one that I haven't got a
chance to talk about a lot I did
snapchat this one if you aren't
following me on snapchat is Lori Lee I'm
sowing all kind of a crazy stuff that
Reds a so you can follow me there if you
want to if you don't want to well then
alrighty anyway this is the G way
essential high coverage cream foundation
I underestimated this so whenever I put
it on
I just pumped it out and I was like okay
like did like three or four of these
pumps and baby girl a pea-sized amount
will cover your whole entire face like
it's just like oh that's just the trick
with this stuff and it's very liquidy so
here's what it looks like on it's just a
super liquidy light light lightweight
foundation but extreme coverage so this
is one of those foundations that just
has that intense coverage like extremely
intense coverage but it's extremely
lightweight and you don't haven't used a
lot of product and what I like about
that is that foundations like this lasts
you for a really long time because
you're only using a pea-sized amount so
you're not gonna burn through a lot of
foundation and it being somewhat of a
higher and brand you know it's nice to
not have to use that much and be able to
stretch your product out and be able to
use it longer it's also long wearing
actually Manny I believe it's the one
who turned me on to that he is a
full-coverage girl as well and he was
like oh it will shake you with the cover
so I just want any if you get it I only
use a little bit but it is a great
product it looks really beautiful on the
skin it's not too matte not not cakey at
all by any means and doesn't settle in
the lines y'all because she got she got
the lab okay let's talk high end I'm
just going to mention this one to get it
out of the way because I talked about it
135 how many days in a year 365 I talked
about this 365 days of the year this is
the vanish stick foundation from
hourglass it's just the best this is
just one of those foundations when you
don't feel like messing around and
fooling with stuff you just know you
need your makeup to look good and last
we're long time all day and put the
color just to be right I just forgot
this I also travel with it a lot because
it's in stick form so it's not gonna
break as chance of someone that glass
bottles this is such a good foundation
I've been using this for so long it's
just been a Holy Grail in mine I know a
lot of makeup artists that buy the
lighter shades and they considerably a
concealer and foundation on one so they
actually can seal with this and they'll
actually contour with these there's
multi Stix they just came out with
highlighters and these sticks which I'm
pretty excited about I have them over
there but haven't had a chance of trauma
yeah but I'm gonna try only you guys
know the TT on that I highly
they recommend these super long wearing
Super Bowl covers beautiful on the skin
yes me okay next up is one that I've
also been wearing for a long time this
bottle is girl this bomb nice Jesus this
is the Milani consume perfect so this
one is actually a concealer and
foundation as well mixed into one I
personally still wear a concealer with
these I just like to highlight as well
instead of have my whole face one shade
but this is a really amazing amazing
long wearing foundation I've been
wearing for this one this one for a long
time and I am shade fi beige so with
this one I just don't think it had like
a super super super matte finish to it
and I feel like it has like a slight
glow to it which looks really beautiful
but this is like one of the most full
coverage drugstore foundations that
looks high in I just think this product
looks so high-end
whenever you use it and it wears
high-end like you can't tell the
difference if you haven't tried this
save it all Abilio and try it out
because it's affordable and it's great
it's just a really good formula okay
next up one this year I love that I'm
talking about in newer foundations
because we need to hear the T on the new
foundations because I will beat a dead
horse with an old foundation but I tried
out new stuff this year and I'm proud of
myself I mean kind of towards the end of
last year too I forget it's like a brand
new year you know we're in January so
the Laura Mercier flawless fusion long
wear foundation the first time I ever
wore this I applied it I had like a 1011
hour day like I literally were until
like 1:00 in the morning and I was still
going and someone looked at me and off
oh oh baby girl my makeup looks rough
like I knew it had to look rough because
I had had it on for like 12 hours and
girl you know we just send that fresh
hadn't even had a chance to touch up and
the girl looks at me and goes no I was
gonna compliment you because your
foundation looks so beautiful and I was
seriously this foundation was probably
the best long wearing foundation on all
these so if you're one of those people
who just kisses situations where your
intention of your makeup for 12 hours
you can count on this it literally says
on it no it doesn't say just kidding
semi-matte a little bit dewy to it
really beautiful Laura Mercier
their strong point and makeup and NARS
is their basis which I said that last
time video said the base makeup which is
the face makeup and arrow I thought I
said the face makeup which is the face
makeup and I said base with a B as in
bumble bee and then people didn't hear
me right and I was embarrassed but the
biggest makeup is good they make release
they're really strong and fish products
that's just their setting powders and
their concealers and their foundations
which is really hard to formulate but a
filly both brands just like kill it in
that area another one we're gonna talk
about this little guy right here this is
the 24 hour okay I don't think it's good
for 24 hours and if you're wearing
makeup for 24 hours it might be 10
delicious face we gotta watch our faces
I love the extreme um though the extreme
like 62 Alouette foundation like who's
wearing their hair that long okay I'm
being dramatic but like the 24 hour is
like anyways this is the brand new super
stay full coverage foundation from
Maybelline I've been wearing shade at
310 beige I want to show you it looks
like it feels a little bit whippy on the
skin somewhat lightweight it's not too
thick filling so with this foundation I
really think it gives your skin a nice
airbrushed finish very full coverage
which I'm so proud of from a feeling
coming out with drugstore doesn't come
out with a lot of full coverage makeup
most of its like medium or light
coverage you can possibly build it up so
whenever you get a good drugstore a full
coverage foundation I'm like ah here for
all day and I'm have a child but
Maybelline came out with one I really
like Maybelline foundations I've had a
good run with them especially the matte
and poreless another good one this one
goes on in it to me it looks somewhat
matte but I feel like it gets slightly
dewy throughout the day that might just
be my skin talking to me but I think it
looks really beautiful whenever you put
it on super high coverage which I'm very
proud of that it is long wearing haven't
tested out for wearing it for 24 hours
but you know I wonder for a day and it
were very well and looked really
beautiful on the skin I'm gonna continue
to wear it and I'm gonna show you guys
how it wears at the end of this video so
just hang tight for that but overall I
do like the foundation and I do
recommend it for those of you who are
looking for a high coverage foundation
at an affordable cost okay
we're gonna talk about this now try that
foundation this is the Make Up For Ever
HD this is just an another old-school
Holy Grail my name is old school but
it's been around for a few years and
it's just been great and I've seen
makeup artists use this time after time
after time because it's just an
all-around good foundation this is
another one day you can really count on
to wear very well for you a lot of stick
foundations are high coverage here's a
little snippet of what it looks like on
it really sticks to the skin as well it
does still kind of thick it doesn't
really go on Matt to me I think it has a
bit of a lumi finish to it but it just
sticks onto the skin so well it has
really beautiful coverage I think if you
really want it to you can make this one
more of a medium coverage where you only
using a little bit but really applying
it on and getting in there with it I
think it definitely is full coverage and
I'm mostly again like to use my stick
foundations with a brush versus a beauty
blender you can totally use them with
the beauty blender if you want to I just
think for a thicker product the dents of
the brush the easier it is to move it
around versus the liquidy products
beauty blenders work beautifully for but
you guys know I'm always about that
why six-month okay let me take off my
foundation they got on right now and
then let me show you what they might be
laying 24-hour foundation look like fish
my centers so you guys are wondering
what liquid lipstick I had on it had on
the makeup forever 107 I'm gonna add a
little bit my first salty farce Ollie
droplets to my face cuz girl we got a
primer I really like these because they
go on and they feel really liquidy but
then after like a few seconds they
become a little bit tacky and I love
that tacky feel oh it feels good right
before you put your foundation on I just
make you feel like you're sticking your
foundation onto your face I'm also going
to use my y6 brush from morphe to blend
this out that is my go-to foundation
brush if you're new to this channel it's
just what I use okay here I go
alright so now I'm just gonna buff it
out with this brush and if you can see
it literally just looks so beautiful and
wound out really pretty on the skin I
think it looks so like flawless and
gorgeous see how it's like goes on like
I mean it doesn't look that matte in the
picture but like straight on it looks
kind of matte but it gives like this
natural kind of glow to it where you
don't look like you're wearing that full
coverage of makeup boys I'm just not
real close by just want you guys to get
like and see get up in there and see
like how it looks I think it looks
really pretty I mean it is somewhat
mattifying through here but just overall
like the foundation is beautiful and
most importantly it wears very well on
the skin so yeah I really like it I just
want to show you guys that little review
and show how it really looks alright
