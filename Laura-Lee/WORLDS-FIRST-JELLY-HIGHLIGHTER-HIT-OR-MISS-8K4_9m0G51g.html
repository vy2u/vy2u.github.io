I have a huge ulcer on the side of my
mouth
so I'm talking like I'm trying to hold
my jaw it's so my mouth doesn't rub on
my teeth and it hurts so so bad then I'm
filming this week so unfortunately
there's gonna be two or three more video
somebody talking like this I'm so sorry
I know it's distracting just know I'm
hurting anywho
besides that today's video is super
exciting because I have a new product to
test out and it is a jelly highlighter
excuse me a jelly highlighter what does
that even mean how cool is that so I'm
gonna be trying this out this is the
first size is by force Ollie which you
guys are probably familiar with they're
teardrop I didn't even sing my subscribe
song I'm just jumping right in that's
what we're testing out today we're gonna
go ahead and jump into the video on the
single subscribe song let's do it
now let's go ahead and jump ready okay
I'm real excited about today's video by
the way this is by force ollie they did
send it to me in PR and this is the
press she that came with it
and it is a jelly highlighter and it
comes in really cool packaging that
closes all the way but I've already
opened it because I couldn't wait but
the packaging looks like this it says
jelly bean on it super pretty gold jelly
bean glaze you can see the highlight in
there because introducing for Sully
jelly being an innovative color that
implies like gel but that's like a
powder leaving behind exclusive wet
satin globe put on cream highlights and
I feel like if I don't set them with a
powder highlight or whatever cream
product I put on I feel like if I don't
set it with a powder it just literally
stuffs and slides around so that's
annoying this is a really cool formula
this is a stay all day hybrid formula it
says in the sheet it says a lot of other
information about it it's gonna be 40
bucks at for Sally calm it says you can
also mix it and with your foundation or
the rose gold elixir and you can apply
it to your shoulders arms and body for a
whole body linkage which I will probably
do at some point and it is super
concentrated and buildable so you can go
from subtle to blinding I pretty much
think this is gonna be blinding just
whether it looks at it so you use it
with your finger or a brush I found a
brush that already you'd like to use it
with because I did swatch it on my arm
oh you put on your eyelids this is like
use all of your body but all
highlighters technically are I'm gonna
open it up and you can see it's like
super jelly like like I want to eat it
so bad it looks so yummy I know I'm
weird anyways I found this brush this is
a morphe 334 I'm gonna go three three
four what's my area code in the right
my kid over here oh she's scared herself
for day okay okay yeah I know I scared
you oh no you leaky weak girl just being
a cat mom also I'm in the process of
moving so that's why my background is
like gone at my desk
oh don't mind that we have a little
distraction in the video Oh giddy don't
rip out my okay you're gonna rip off my
ear
this hurts let go I mean it's just real
this is real this is YouTube this is how
its raw guys this is YouTube okay this
is a TV commercial this is literally
what life is like and you're gonna
experience it with me isn't that right
yeah yeah mm-hmm cool so now we're gonna
put on high light that looks like jelly
because the lid of the hologram like has
so much product in it I feel like I'd be
wasteful if I didn't just tap into the
lid now this is the day for brush are
you all ready I'm gonna put some of my
Hanks I think I got way too much okay
here we go
Oh blend it out so easy so easy
and it says you can build it up so we're
gonna add a little more yeah it
definitely turns into like a powder like
this doesn't feel gooey or well or
sticky whatsoever it feels like super
dry and beautiful okay here I go
other side I pack some on this side cuz
it just blends out and mind you I'm
blending this on top of a powder out on
bronzer blush you know setting powder
under my concealer on top of my
concealer I'm sorry and this is just
like so smooth
okay I'm gagged right now this may be my
new favorite thing this is so freaking
pretty guys like I I cannot deal I just
want to bathe in it and it doesn't feel
sticky whatsoever it doesn't look patchy
it doesn't weird I think this color is
really really pretty on my skin if you
can see it's just so dry it's completely
dry on my skin Wow
I'm currently like blown away I am
completely in shock right now assumed
you guys in a little closer so you can
just see like how smooth and you can see
like how it's not sticky at all it looks
so beautiful like I'm in shock
the color is kind of champagne II and I
definitely agree it is buildable I
didn't use like a wispy or a fan brush
with it which is what I typically would
apply a highlighter with I used this
brush right here which is like an angled
mini kabuki which is the three through
four and it worked out really great
again you don't have to have a special
brush to use with it you can literally
just use your finger if you need to but
just using this right off the bat like I
literally it's just the glow doesn't
look powdery at all
it looks like it's melted into my skin
without me spraying mac fix+ on top of
it so I'm just like gagged right now
this is me just putting it on the back
of my hand if you can see oh let's put
some on the collarbone why not some
right here like okay I'll just do my
whole chest like why not right look how
pretty that is
uh my final thoughts on this product I
think we all know the answer to that I
think it is literally one of the coolest
highlighters I've ever used you guys
know I'm a sucker for highlight I adored
the putty highlight the jelly bean
highlight is everything it is $40 so
it's not you know for one highlight
shade 40 bucks I feel like it's a little
bit pricey but I also feel like it could
be a good deal because just a dab of
this goes a long way so depending I
don't know if it dries out or not like I
literally just got it in the mail so I
then had it long enough to know if it
dries out if it doesn't dry out a touch
of this goes a long way you literally
use this for over a year and so
therefore I think it is worth the money
in that case if it does try out well
then that's a little floppy you know it
should be less than $40 but we that's
making an accusation like I don't know
that it dries out it may never dry out
it doesn't look like it's going to and
it's a very air sight air tight
container so that's a great sign the
quality of the container is really nice
too so I like the packaging it's so
pretty
so overall I give this three thumbs up
if I could I think it's beautiful and I
honestly will be using it all the time I
adore this product like it's so so
pretty it's actually exactly what I look
for in a highlight look for it to me not
too powdery not too too creamy set well
with my other products that's on my face
to not look patchy or dusty or flaky and
it doesn't do any of that so I'm excited
about it guys thank you all so much for
being here and watching this launches
November the 1st I don't know if I said
that or not it says that on the pressure

first start for sarli I think that's how
