video is going to be a review of this it
Cosmetics new foundation this is the
first error this is the first ever solid
serum foundation out if you like your
serum salvation you obviously first
think of like a really liquidy or the
dropper whole shebang but this one is a
solid so I'm real interested to see
what's about to happen with leuh it's
going to be a first impressions video so
I haven't tried it out at all I did like
pill open the thing just to look at the
color to make sure I'm like starting off
with a decent color yeah I'm just going
to be interesting also I'm giving away
two Mac red pros as you do to enter is
be subscribe to my channel for one and
my blog channel for the other one in and
March 15th so be sure and subscribe
today
that's the way quit goofing around and
we're going to go ahead and get started
and test out this foundation does it
work is it weird why is it solid I don't
know jump right in and get started
alright so we have zoomed on in and as
you can see I mean okay there's a little
left over foundation but I've eyes wiped
off I've wiped off all of the foundation
on my face by the way a tutorial on this
eye look is coming very soon so hang
tight for the eyes which is my skin as
you can see let's get real close up so
you can see it mm-hmm
here it is and I'm going to be trying
out this foundation this is called the
confidence in the compact foundations
the first ever solid serum foundation I
have shade medium and medium tan today
I'll be using shade medium medium Panza
way to tan for me there's only seven
shades in it I'm showing you this base
in just in like a PR package or whatever
has some like information on it but I'm
just showing you this tell you much
information on it which could be very
useful for the video seven shades I'm a
little like why only seven shades and
it's just their universal shade so what
does that mean I have confusion there
just being honest it has SPF 50 in it
that is a lot of sunscreen and it also
has their moisturiser confidence in a
cream that's like a really popular
moisturizer they came out with it has it
in it and it's clinically shown to have
you better looking skin weightless mess
free and full coverage okay so the full
covers now we're gonna test this
out and see girl
yeah and it says it pairs best would
there brush that they did send to me
this video is not obviously is not
sponsored by them but they did send the
product I didn't go out and buy it it
came in a PR package but here's the
brush they recommend using with it
I burned my arm get real close as a
personal comes in a cute typical compact
little sponge that we want you so here
it is it already peeled this part off
because I want to check the color see
the medium there I haven't touched it
yet but I'm real interested to I just
want to like I'm just going to dig my
finger in it okay so I thought it was
going to be ah why did I do this not
like really hard in there which I just
figured out and I'm gonna wipe this off
with my finger I don't know why I
decided to do that but I had to I don't
know something just asked me to so I'm
going to take this brush and says firmly
swirl it around in there that is the
instruction so for best results I'm out
to firmly swirl this little sucker in
there oh it's so spaced out like so I'm
swirling making a mess this brush is
full of product so now I'm just going to
stipple it on my face as I would oh it
feels so cold and this color is fabulous
I think it's going to be fabulous on me
there are some questions it is pretty
full coverage I'm not going to lie
color actually might be a little bit
light form eighties you know shoot this
cold feels so good on my skin cuz I'm
kind of hot in front of these lights
this brush is I think it's a pretty
typical foundation brush like I don't
think there's anything specific or
special about it I think what makes it
work so good with the foundation is the
size of the brush and that is kabuki
formed so if you already had like a
kabuki brush this size you wouldn't have
to get the brush I'm really tempted to
try out the medium tan that's what
medium tan looks like yeah medium tan is
actually in my shade not medium great so
half my face is light and the other half
is dark when I get for doing first
impressions off oh it's so cold yeah I
just got my hair skin feeling cold
smells like sunscreen and that
confidence in a cream moisturizer it
blends out easy very easy it feels way
thicker like
because mind you is not a cushion
foundation which is what the packaging
portrays it as the cushion foundation
non cushion foundation the semi faces
light on just took a little dab of it on
this side is trying to even out that
color just a little bit it's pretty
thick guys and that's going to live like
it's sick it feels sticky and kind of
heavy I'm a I'm not like hating that I'm
just like describing to you how it feels
now I feel like I've applied it evenly
it applied easy it wasn't patching on my
skin the coloring it I don't get one of
the seven shades of it it's going to let
you get that close up no judgement
please I'm going to wear it for a little
bit and come back with you guys but it's
a little bit shiny right now it's still
sticky it does feel a little bit heavy
but it looks beautiful on the skin and
it feels like it could definitely be
moisturizing it's as much sunscreen and
moisturizer is in this I don't know that
it would be great for oily skin that's
just like a setup and in my brain I
immediately kind of would be like Oh
careful with that was all a scam by the
way I'm putting on a little bit of wet
and wild concealer as I normally would
to see kind of how it wears with that
comment is big powder brush and on so
I'm just going to add a little bit of my
loose powder to set it to give it a fair
run because I would set any foundation
up on my face definitely mattified it
made it look really pretty I mean this
is super full coverage so guys like I
have circles that run all along here and
you can't see them so so far not a lie
I'm loving it
shoot honestly didn't think I would like
it because I'm not really for companies
compacted foundations I'm not really
Forks they're normally too sticky and
heavy it does so a little bit heavy but
like after I said it and you poop
outside is so sticky though after you
said it that it's so smooth and the
coverage is unreal throw test just to
see how it's going to wear I am going to
wear it for a few hours and then I wear
it for a lot longer and then I'm going
to set the rest of my face I am going to
check in after a few hours and then I
have to go somewhere so I'm not gonna be
able to check in again but what I'll do
is after a few hours of wearing it I'll
check in let you see my skin let you see
my face and then I write in the
description box how it wore after about
eight hours which is a typical workday
so you guys could see like how it's
going to last you throughout your
workday mind you I said it so make sure
you're setting
you know potentially get the same
results I know everybody's skin type is
different so far just reading it I would
stay away from it with all the skin but
haven't read it out yet my drive is very
Olli right here on me just right there
and in my forehead it gets so greasy and
I'm sweating bullets right now so this
will be a really great test to see what
happens with out okay so okay guys this
is my check-in and can we talk about a
little lipstick I haven't touched it up
and I ate dinner I have cat here on my
face too but let's see how these smell
ons are doing it looks pretty good not
in the smile lines getting me a little
bit shiny in there but no it's not
really stupid in my smile lines it may
be a little bit shiny through here I
figured I would just because the product
but the shine isn't anything serious
it's been four hours and like that the
shine isn't anything that's like poop
like life changes is too greasy to deal
with this is about mold for me about any
foundation that I wear so so far so good
I will be wearing it I'm going I'm
leaving and I'll be wearing it for
another probably four hours and then I'm
going to leave in the description box my
thoughts on it after those four hours
it's not as heavy and greasy as I
thought it was going to be after I said
it it feels so smooth on my face and not
sticky whatsoever that's just one little
part of it that if you don't set it
which I recommend do you're going to
deal with and I personally don't like
the overall foundation I like a lot and
I love the coverage that it gives cuz
that is some serious badass coverage I
love that it has sunscreen in it but it
does is it is greasy I feel like
anything a cosmetics has because the
dermatology maid and plastic surgery is
made I feel like that it is just so
sunscreen and skin protecting which is
so amazing but at the same time
sunscreen always makes me extra greasy
and this one's hanging with me I love
that it's not seeping into my smile
lines because sometimes I literally it
will be like cracks into my smile lines
and it looks cry cry by the way sorry I
just realized that the compact is 38
which is not a bad price for a
high-end foundation I mean normally
high-end foundations are 48 50 55
somewhere in this 238 is a little bit of
a lower price for a high-end product not
saying a low price in general but the
brush is $48 which has got me a little
stumped there how the hell is the brush
more than the actual product and not
only that I mean let me just find a
similar dupe I mean there's always BF 88
by Sigma bit to do like the white 7 by
morphe I mean it's not angled but I feel
like it was fit in there and be fine to
blend out the product well I am paying
$50 for a brush no thank you but I do
agree that a brush would be the best
option and applying this product to your
skin and then perhaps with the
foundation and I also think it would be
amazing for mature skin amazing for dry
skin and not even really bad for oily
skin because my only spots are not
looking bad at all I mean like I said a
little shine here in here as expected
but normal that's nothing like looking
terrible so yeah that's my thoughts on
it be sure to check the description box
my thoughts after 8 hours thank you guys
so much for being here and watching hope
this video was helpful and let you know
my thoughts upon it
that's cute packaging I liked it it's
silver we can subscribe to my channel
for you leave and I hope to see all of
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
