but I do hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is going to be talking
about remove the blinding highlights on
the market that you can get this was
actually kind of hard because I actually
have a lot of highlights that will blind
you
you know these highlights are good for
situations whenever you want your
highlight into the room first and you
come 10 minutes later whenever you may
need a flashlight you could use one of
these highlights these highlights are
great for raising your credit score
whenever you want to be popping for the
back row whenever your grandmom can't
see she needs a good light getting a man
but then you realize you don't need a
man highlights are great for all kinds
of scenarios in your life they all have
one thing in common and it is that they
are popping and by popping I mean they
are anything but so they are loud huh
you will see them coming a mile away
these are the highlights to show up in
your Instagram pictures so these are the
highlights you need in your life
I do wear subtle highlights I don't
always but I do occasionally throw on a
natural highlight jump right in I have a
lot to talk about so I'll probably move
kind of fast let you know the gist and
move on
hope you guys enjoy the video subscribe
before you leave and let's be absorbent
okay what highlight deserves me talking
about it first
first I know I'm going to start off with
I'm gonna start off with probably one of
the oldest ones that's been out on the
market and it is show by Mac candy
Johnson introduced me to shell by Mac
way back in the day meaning like three
years ago but highlights were not what
they were today three years ago and
shell has been around for a very long
time this is a cream color from Mac and
I would remember any time I would want
my highlight to pop or pick up on the
flash on my camera I would put shell on
and if you didn't know cream highlight
can be the strongest highlights of all
I'll do a cool trick with shell you can
apply to your upper cheekbone or ever
you want to apply your highlight and
then put a powder on top of it and it
will be popping popping for the god
super powerful and what I noticed most
about shell is that it will have you
glowing glowing glowing in pictures so
I've always loved this as a puppet oh
god link and it won't break if you drop
it next up is jeffree star cosmetics
this is a skin frost and it's called a
skin frost because it literally looks
like you frost at your skin whenever you
well I think we all know and have heard
these been talked about so much on
YouTube and they are so powerful okay my
favorite is peach goddess and these are
actually also very beautiful eyeshadows
but I mean just as - honey and you will
be glowing for days also they are the
size of my head so you'll probably never
run out and let me just throw this out
there and meant to say this in the
beginning of the video but we all know
I'm scattered brain so I forgot I
personally love fan brushes but they
don't apply a lot of product so they can
be good for that you know for a subtle
amount of products in a subtle amount of
highlight but if you really want your
highlight popping I prefer using a
little bit more of a dense brush in here
some good options the more feet are 36
is one of my all-time favorite highlight
brushes it picks up the product like no
other and it's what I use today and it
is good a more affordable option is by
elf and this one is it just literally
has no name on it you know it's just ill
but hopefully I'll find out on the
website and linked down below and I also
like the wide 14 brush which is very
similar to the r-36 buy more feet of a
morphe brushes but this one is also a
great one to apply high so those options
there but I mean if you really want to
be popping for years on in go ahead and
get you a jeffree star highlight you so
many colors and on this one's just my
favorite one and it will last you years
you could bathe in this and still have
some left over it is so incredibly
pigment so it's soft and creamy and you
know what another thing would be
highlight I don't like a highlight that
you put it on it look like white powder
which that has happened to me before
you know and I got played from a
highlight I want it to look like a glow
not like a white strip of powder next is
artist Couture you guys probably aren't
I knew I was going to mention this and I
wear it in a very specific way to make
it like poppin this is iluminati we
would not even concede it on my
favorites today I have Illuminati on
deck to share with you what I personally
like to do is to get some on my brush
then I will apply it to the skin which i
shouldnt see it's already pop lock and
drop in it right there now I'll take
some of my mac fix+
and wet it
and that will literally melt in my skin
and it literally just looks like my skin
it's just like butter blowing away you
can't even tell you almost can't even
til I have a makeup product on my skin
and literally will just melt into your
skin make your skin look it's glowing
I know some people like to apply mac
fix+ and then pack it on to the mac fix+
that works too this is my preference
because they really melt it down as you
can see that's like that's like super
melted into the skin but yet still
really lit up next up is cover FX it
took me a long time to love these
because I didn't know how to use them
sometimes I don't know how to use things
but these are the custom enhancer drop
these are actually the brand new colors
to just launched this is rose gold and
this is a blossom we have a rose gold
and a pinky color on a brand trip that I
recently went on actually applied this
all over my body girl look cool oh and
the best way I have found to apply these
is I add to a dampened sponge like that
and then I'll pack it on the cheek and
let me just do my hand they just give
you a really bright highlight it melted
in the skin kind of glow and they're
custom so you can kind of just use it I
just want to stamp my skin with this so
you can use as much as you want with it
you can apply it to your skin and then
blend it out with a Beauty Blender blend
it out with your fingers I just find
that me might happiest way of using it
and to get it most effective you can
also mix it in with your lotion which is
kind of what I did and rubbed it all
over my body there's a bunch of
different ways you can use them but
they're super powerful and they're
really amazing product next up is by
Oprah and these are like one of those
products where you're not supposed to
judge a book by it's cover because these
look I don't know to me they don't look
like they were crazy great highlighter
they look so normal in the packaging I
don't want to say it's cheap packaging
but it's very simple packaging these
packs the most powerful highlighting
punch I'm going to take actually want to
take Rodeo Drive because it's my
favorite it's almost like a champagne
rose Goldie themed in there I will say
these do get like a smidge bit dusty but
it's well worth using it because they're
just so pigmented mm-hmm like Oh as you
can see these are just they're insane
how much pigmentation you get out of
these there and oh god how beautiful
this was I mean I remembered but I
didn't remember how beautiful it was I
remembered how powerful their just
everything and I highly recommend these
especially if you just want that
highlighting glow okay next up it's a
product I haven't been able to talk
about for a while because it's been out
of stock but it tomorrow comes back in
stock but I don't know what I'm going to
get this video uploaded so pray this
isn't stopped when the video goes up
because this part it's going to be
annoying okay next is the new way
highlighter which these are so pretty I
love the packaging the packaging screams
hi I'm going to blind you and then you
open it up and these have been loved oh
they're so freakin pretty so trained my
favorite they have topaz which is the
deepest one out of all of them and rose
quartz which is the lightest one out of
all of them to train us the medium one
to train is my favorite so that's why I
must watch for you today literally you
don't have to do your brush into this
product because it will come off that's
honey yes there she is she is here
that's actually what I'm wearing on
today I know I've been playing around
dusting everything on my face but that
is what initially I had on my face today
I'm so excited to be able to wear it
again I try not to wear products too
much that are out of stock which is
obviously I list them on Instagram and
in my videos what I'm wearing and no one
can get it I hear in the comments and I
get it it's annoying it's like girl so I
normally just shy away from props
they're out of stock but hopefully it'll
be bad luck on getting your hands on
these they are absolutely marvelous last
but not least is that Becca's champagne
pop girl here champagne popper does
anyone else remember that Halloween skit
I did with Gabriel and Jacqueline
anyways this is a Becca highlight and
you just can't deny that Becca
highlights aren't good they're fabulous
and they're also very creamy very
pigmented - another product that you
don't have to dig deep to get a
highlight out of it and there she is
that's champagne pop and you can't deny
it can you tell that I love the same
color scheme
and I also feel like these highlights
right here you don't have to scrape off
the top layer to dig down in there and
get it going all these are so intensely
pigmented that it's just ready to go
right whenever you get it and a lot of
them go like human because girl it will
take your breath away anyways that is it
for this video pop lock and drop in it
with these highlighters that was
embarrassing in such a weird thing say I
hope you enjoyed this video I hope it
like helps you get to where you want to
get your highlight to be I love you guys
thanks for watching be sure and
subscribe to my channel so that my
jacket doesn't match my background and
it's annoying me so anyway yeah see you
