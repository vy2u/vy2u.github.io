that one with ham down hey guys what's
up and welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a makeup tutorial
but I'm gonna be using to some of the
world's most expensive makeup and I've
never felt more bougie in my life also
this'll give me a little heads up I
currently have an old Fleur right here
at my freaking mouth and it hurts so bad
so if you see me talking barely trying
to move my bottom jaw like it's because
like oh it's a situation going on I get
older sometimes because I hooks on my
teeth for my Invisalign to help pull my
teeth back and sometimes they just rub
my mouth wha-whoa raw and sometimes my
mouth gets bumped and it just causes a
little sore so this ulcer is just in
there canker sore I don't like to say
the word canker sore because the word
canker makes me wanna gag anyways um
also I had the new Pat McGrath palette
and it is like the mothership 3 I got
about the mothership 3 from Sephora and
a whole bunch of other makeup to test
out for you guys so I hope you're
excited to see this video and before we
get started we're gonna sing a little
song Wayne without further ado we're
gonna go ahead and jump right in and get
started
you guys see my shirt today in case of
emergency
choose the black shoes hello super cute
in a clever so I bought it anyway so
here's my face this is what it looks
like you guys have seen it before with
no makeup on it first we're gonna try
out what I'm gonna try out we've already
tried this on my channel but this is the
why is that all ours primer I wrote down
some prices so we could talk about
expensiveness this is 58 big one it's
quite process I think it is oh my god I
just poured out twelve dollars worth of
primer I'm just gonna apply it with this
little brush and this is super bushi I
find that this primer I have no mirror
like I'm just doing my tutorial looking
in the viewfinder that's not good
but I feel like this primer is super
thin I don't think that this is a
do-or-die primer I think it's a nice
primer but I don't really think it
creates miracles on the skin or helps
with texture anything like that I think
it's just a bit moisturizing and that's
it so again I just want you guys to know
that like this makeup I'm not trying to
convince you to buy okay and I will tell
you the T on what I think about it girl
we just come from all over from the
mustache the under eye and that way my
skin has some moisture okay cool I just
wasted half the bottle I do like it it
leaves your face feeling very smooth but
next we're gonna try out an exciting
product because this is floating run
YouTube for quite a while now and I'm a
little bit late on it I've had it for a
long time but I didn't know if I wanted
to do a dedicated video or some type of
tutorial so I figured I'd do a tutorial
trying out this product like really
expensive makeup and what better
foundation to use right so this is the
lottery skin caviar but it has a
concealer which i've swatched with it
and then i wouldn't use the foundation
no I did that wrong so it doesn't
unscrew how does this work
stand with brush oh my god so it comes
in the package with a bougie stand and a
little foundation brush which is just so
tiny Oh like look you like put your
foundation on the sand with the brush in
the side girl that is so extra oh it's a
paddle huh so here's the tea for me I'm
so glad that this is my color first of
all
second of all I don't know about this
little brush that comes with it I think
it's a waste of my time I'm gonna show
you what I mean by that it smells good
but do you really think I'm out to blend
out my whole face the foundation with
this like three years later here's Laura
still filming her video like girl that's
just not gonna happen
I feel like this is just a waste of
money but what I will blend it out with
is the y6 from OFI so here I go I'm just
gonna stipple it out I'm not gonna lie
it's plenty out really easy it is so
much sheer on my skin smells like
luxuriousness whatever that smells like
looking at the foundation I kind of feel
like it's sitting on top of my skin like
it's not blending into my skin that well
I'm gonna let it set there and do my
concealer and see what happened I don't
know do you see what I mean like I blend
it and I just feel like no matter how
much I rub it it's like super
moisturized and like uh it's like not
like melting into my skin it's not
adhering to my skin it's like setting on
top of my skin which I'm not like dying
for right now I'm gonna be using at the
all hours concealer from YSL this is $58
concealer and it does work nicely it's
not as thick and whippy as the NARS it's
more liquidy that helps give you a
reference I'm gonna use the same brush
and just blend out the concealer I still
feel like the foundation is just not
getting tacky
oh my god look at that I like what's
going on I feel like I could just wipe
my hand and wipe half of it off this is
not drying down to my skin it's just
staying wet on top of my skin can you
guys see like my face feels gross and
geeky we're gonna be past it so next I'm
gonna go in with another la patrie
product that's super super fancy this is
the big powder and the powder is a
hundred dollars it is a huge jar comes
with a sponge it comes with this little
key thing I don't know what the key is
for I think is to lift this if you want
it to get down into it like they just
have so many bougie accessories am i mad
about that No
Oh cute like I popped it open Tom this
powder seems to be super colorful so I
don't know if I should set my under-eye
wither or just set like let's see I
gotta set this foundation y'all because
it's so like wet filling and
that definitely helped the foundation is
still even still as shiny on the skin so
it's an interesting little foundation
definitely not like my favorite first
off but I'm not gonna send my under eye
with this because as of right now it's
just too dark it's my skin color so I'm
gonna take away all the highlight if I
set my whole under eye with it
so I'm just gonna tap into a little bit
alarm RCA translucent powder and just
set oh let's put myself in that eye and
just set this area and this is the cake
baked sponge so next we'll do with the
eyes this is the Pat McGrath this is the
mothership number 3 palette the back of
its gold is super super heavy plastic
made palette and then you open it and
the pan sizes are pretty big you get a
total of 10 i shadow shades for 125
dollars as well as a mirror so let's
swatch a couple of the shades so far
they feel pretty good I just went ahead
and swatched everything I love the
quality of the mattes I think there's
some of the softest matte eyeshadows and
even this shimmer this shimmer and this
these two shimmers were super soft but
if you can see here some of them are
just kind of almost like a moon dust
shadow from Urban Decay like a little
bit flaky bit more era Desa and glittery
very pretty but they're just like that
if you can see like that era doesn't dry
dryer eyeshadow not like a creamy
shimmer it's more of a glitter eyeshadow
and probably would work best with a
glitter primer and you'd probably get a
lot of pigment out of it so I'm going to
test it on my eyes first I'm gonna go
ahead and put my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre all over my eyelid you guys can
see there's not really a transition
shade in this palette
the only mats are the black and dark
chocolate brown so I'm just gonna grab a
transition shade and place it in my
crease just so we can get started with
the look you're wondering like what this
is is it's just a lash glue who has
permanently placed itself in the crease
of my eye and will not get out so
annoying I'm like leave me alone large
glue and then I just put more on it's a
neverending story of my life just have a
nice soft matte transition shade down
which is gonna make it easier just to
blend out everything else and make
everything flow and be happy
it hurts to smile I did that with the m5
37 brush I'm gonna get our 39 and just
put a warm tone Brown just right in that
outer corner and I'm doing this because
I'm gonna use a lot of colors how the
Pat McGrath palette I just need a couple
base colors down to do a complete look
and I really want to do like a super
good look with it in order to do so I
just need like two Brown shades now
we're probably gonna dip into at this
brown shade it has very minimal but a
little bit of kick up which is
completely normal and I'm gonna pack
this pretty chocolatey brown shade right
in that outer corner right there splint
out so nicely
look how pigmented that is so these
colors are very pretty
I'm gonna go ahead and push it in the
inner corner as well with the same r39
brush and I just do two small circular
motions going round and round and round
until it's really softly blended these
eyeshadows are super easy to work with
and the more you blend them it seems
like if you can see right there it gets
a little bit deeper which is super
pretty and I personally love that about
the shadow I think it's so good sorry if
you guys can hear my husband yelling
about the football game right now
Alabama's playing to the sea
we're probably gonna win all my
Tennessee fans are like I get it I get
it
I get the rivalry I get it trust me I'm
an Alabama fan
everybody's our rival so I'm gonna go
ahead and do the exact same thing over
here and just pop it pop drop and lock
it right there
and that inner corner can you guys see
how absolutely beautiful this brown
color is like it's so pretty she did
such a good job oh and this is why I
want it you see how it has a little bit
of warmth peaking out right here right
here and that's why I just wanted to put
down you know and not just going with a
brown color and put down something warm
underneath so it has a little bit of
gradients to it now it's like what color
should I should should I should I should
I should I use I must want to use like
one of these cuz I never do a lot of
blue on my channel I think I'm gonna use
this one because as you can see this
one's just a little bit grey looking and
might turn out neutral I'm gonna use the
more crazy color
how about my finger I personally love
applying shimmery eyeshadows my finger
and this one seems to be very
pigmented just a little bit chunky if
you can see it's down in my lashes which
is completely normal that is so
pigmented and so pretty so now I'll take
that dirty our 39 brush with a brown
color like left over on it and I'll just
hit the sides very lightly and kind of
blend out that harsh line we created
like that I'm gonna wet some of the
shadow and add just a little more the
same color on the center of my eye just
intensify it a little bit more because I
really want it to pop so hard I think
it's so stunning like this palette is
such good quality girl you done did it
again I'm gonna take a more feet r44 in
tap just into the black shade and kind
of tight line right at my lash line and
this way my fault flashes and my skin
won't show there won't be a gap in
between it really makes it clean and
seals it up curl these lashes my real
bra hair dress I would Hashmi like girl
get back up there we got a brow gel her
I'm going to apply Lily lashes in this
shit and the shade in the Nostalgia
Laura I think I am action I'm gonna hold
it up to my and see if I like it because
I've never worn these before Christina
Aguilera is quite King my husband just
closed the door walk okay okay I'm gonna
take this and wipe away the excess
powder girls she's baked like a kit cake
oh I'm so glad I let you know this is
great this worked out very well little
finger printing but that's definitely
not a do or die for me so what I'm gonna
do now is go ahead and finish off the
lower lash line I'm gonna put that warm
color that I put and then I'm gonna put
the dark brown down there as well I'm
gonna take an M 408 brush with the
darkest brown color I'm gonna pop it
really close to that lower lash line
reading a smoky smoky eye I'm gonna take
my nude pretty vulgar eyeliner and pop
this right in the waterline lately I've
gone back to using nude liner all the
time I love how fresh and awake it makes
the eyes I'm gonna pop on some of the
Diorshow mascara to the lower lash line
of course I'm trying to hold like this
palette to do my makeup cuz the me
is so big and nice in it but at the same
time it weighs like this luxe palette is
so heavy like I'm like oh trying to hold
it up you know I'm saying my face is
looking to her pasty with all the powder
so now I'm gonna add some bronzer I wish
my mouth didn't hurt I should just talk
to you guys like this I want how to feel
the pain whoo this is the Tom Ford
bronzer and gold does so it's like a
really warm tone pretty bronzer but it
has like almost like tiny speckles of
gold shimmer oh yeah this is like a $200
powder brush and I feel like why not use
it
I actually don't love this powder brush
at all to be honest with you like it's
just it does nothing for me
okay but I'm gonna use it just because
we're using the world's most
ridiculously priced expensive stuff I
sing all the time I swear you fake you
would think she's got a good voice the
YouTube comments say otherwise girl what
is that unblended nnessee that's not
blended I'm not to scream but I get
blended you better get your act together
eyebrows China sabotage me today this
bronzer is really pretty it's very warm
however just let you guys know this
shade I got it's like super super warm
next up I've tried this before it cuz
it's peach and I love peach blushes you
guys know that but this is a hundred
dollar blush from LA Pelle and I like to
use it with a Beauty Blender which is I
don't know where oh here we go here we
go so I'll just hit some on the back of
a beauty blender and it sits on top of
powders well yeah it's just on top of
powder super nice I remember it kind of
blends like into a powder I mean it's
super subtle but the blush is pretty
really subtly peach I'm gonna take this
pretty hourglass palette this one is
called amulet ambulant
ambient whoo and this is the volume
number three I'm gonna take this shade
for my highlighter these are super soft
beautiful highlighters like your not
your typical crazy blinding highlighters
but I think it's really pretty and it
gives your skin like a pretty glow but
not like a
crazy like it's not too intense and
crazy I find these melt into your skin
really nice like they're pretty they're
also boo GAA off love Jesus these are
booty I'm gonna go ahead and hit
everything with some setting spray
oh this hot powder on it Oh Lord and
just so you guys know super bougie I
prepped my lips with this it's like a
hundred bucks or two hundred one hundred
and eighty dollars so I actually use
this this was sent to me and it's like a
lip balm and it's got like skincare in
it and then it has like an eye balm that
I've used like once but I ever used two
lip balm few times and that's what's on
my lips right now to prep them so now
I'm gonna wipe it off and we're gonna
apply our lips I'm gonna take the Pat
McGrath and ami OMI oweme oweme I think
it's what it is I'm gonna apply this
color to my lips I think it's super
pretty
it doesn't really match my eyes this
does not match my eye makeup whatsoever
okay
first I'm gonna line my lips with a
Louboutin lip liner a crazy this is l10
be honest with you this is just an
absolute like their lip liner sup it's
sitting here because I'm not just gonna
throw it away but guys like it's so hard
to get the color to come off the lip
liners they're so dry so with that being
said I'm going to take a super extra
boozie boozie lipstick this is the
Louboutin lipstick I don't know it show
you this cuz it doesn't say oh here we
go
7:05 a.m. I think and that's more like
it
okay the lipsticks are way way way
better the lip liner is just like a
total turd a turd in a bucket guys this
is the final look I definitely think a
lot of makeup it's just not worth the
money like these prices are absolutely
insane the foundation I really wasn't
even in love with the highlighter is I
one of the prettiest ones ever the
palette was stunning I loved it the
powder I don't really like the primer I
don't think it's it's a nice primer I'm
not gonna lie I do like it I just it's
not a miracle primer on the bronzers
just a simple warm toned bronzer you
know it's stuff like that I just I don't
die for I don't think it's worth the
money really
but yeah I'll let you guys decide for
yourself you see it the makeup you sell
ha performs leave what you think down in
the comments section I've used so much
money it's worth the making of this
video it's absolutely ridiculous but
