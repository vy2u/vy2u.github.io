I am scaring myself I don't feel like a
weight of the world's on my face right
now what is up guys I know we've been
friends for like probably past like here
yeah cool really building for friendship
to like finally bobtail exactly we have
we're gonna hang out friendships then
like at YouTube friends oh you know so
I'm like okay let's take it to youtube
or yeah today we have decided to try out
the world's miss full coverage
foundation girl is like the opposite of
me I'm like how can I look like I'm not
wearing me funny I don't really know how
this is gonna turn out
I've never got it I'm excited it comes
with this like almost like tin foil
feeling yes you're looking huh it almost
seems kind of weak actually yeah they're
like I feel oh yeah you're right like
super oily yeah just like then it
doesn't look like advertising though
brightly you know it looks like this is
for like serious like people like this
is not that cute
maybe you want to use it but I'm so
interested I'd like full coverage that
almost full coverage here all those
studios so it's like making a movie yeah
like that no wonder I've seen online we
can cover a tattoos oh yes
do you have a tattoo I have a trans man
should we cover it yeah I like like that
like I feel like I would regret it I
didn't know you haven't got one you only
like you would have one I don't do well
with commitment like that so it is a
commitment and that's why I haven't
gotten another one but you should just
use this every single day so that's what
we're gonna do oh you didn't see my
subscribe song yeah let's do it to my
channel
usually these jump into trying to help
let's do it
so should we try out a new partner
anyways even maybe use primer do you
squirty squirty Blair no Portland primer
oh my gosh guys you have to go over to
his channel we film yes we do well we
haven't yet we're going to leave all
like the most expensive item in Sephora
so we were told we had a bit of a
problem some girl who were literally
like trying to scam because she like
took us over to this area where after
Joey literally was Center in the soul
what is the most expensive thing in this
story introduced over to the land cost
$38 really
it's like a paint sample it looks like
you're positive
like is it so directions apply it on to
your clean skin well we just put a
primer on so that happened yeah it's
supposed to fill in wrinkles and prevent
makeup from collecting or pulling oh
that's what my boxes with speakers or
makeup sponge okay I'm your forehead
your chin up over your face and then you
can set it with powder you want to which
we have you're setting up or any bolts
up to so we can use some setting powder
and then assess for removal so basically
I read online that this product is 50%
pigment which is absolutely insane or a
mega product to be especially a
foundation so I'm gonna be like they're
gonna mean yeah paint so we're gonna
apply out with a makeup brush and then
we're gonna blend it out with a damp
Beauty Blender I'm gonna start like on
the cheek site okay okay bag oh my this
is a place feel like they sting yeah I
feel we face me mom huh not really it's
tennis stinks
it doesn't like smells like something
like you would use on set we should we
just do how we should have just done
half the difference
okay it doesn't look okay tell me how
tell me does my everybody is it my phone
does it go the library look yeah right
whenever you definitely have to be this
is oxidizing to the oxygen in the air oh
we have a title man oh god it's any guys
you look so good whoa you're just like
okay the beauty weather helps then they
help it
yeah okay you know I'm just going with
my whole thing's can't get in there get
it get it
okay so I had a couple pimples here I'm
gonna test and see if it covers so I
feel like both the birds if they're
gonna be huge but then if you know in
the middle we did get masks at Sephora
so we'll use that oh yeah already show
that next I feel like you have to use a
lot to get all of that you really do
have to use a lot because then it's just
like this slimy greasy layer and you
know should I see if I can cover my face
don't care with that oh yeah I might as
well honestly it's the craziest thing
I've ever done in my whole life it's so
great it's so hard to tell on your mom
like what is happening it looks scary
should I blend it out now yeah honestly
it's turning more more peak like it's
closer to do you see it what the light
makes it look any wood I'm gonna blend
you know it's really not covering up my
balls right there no it's not
are you we are using enough
like maybe not maybe we need to add a
little more but just look at my zit on
my forehead like yeah I'm like pretty
still they're like obvious yeah maybe
you look sad some more okay I'm gonna
take a big chunk in just let's see you
know you're turning one more oh my god
I'm like look at Amazo visit because
it's not their color you know what I
think it's uh it looked like my color on
the website but the way it's changing
colors the longer it sits in my face
means its oxidizing which means it's
really reacting to the oxygen and the
air which isn't good this it looks like
ham I'll show ya as I turn it on so P oh
my god it's back like look when you
smile looks like you could cut it with
like a knife it looks wet so on your
face it looks soaking wet yes because I
mean how does this compare to other like
Asians
okay I feel like other foundations
aren't as heavy but get cover more I
feel like this is super heavy but isn't
actually covering his mine right
but that's so happy we haven't we've
even put extra on yeah I'm like cover
but we're still not getting like my
adapt my forehead you so see the redness
of this
I am scaring myself like you have a
really bad fun let's fix this up
okay let's make it look good guys I gave
I got Joey to get one of my favorite
ancillary you guys know radiates creamy
by NARS Narcy honey and this is gonna be
so good you're not doing all this
highlighting just do your under eye and
Joey never wears makeup again oh oh yeah
like look at you Oh Joey starts
makeup tutorial
oh I miss me you look way better it does
it looks better huh she's still red I've
never had a foundation really go red on
me I thought they had a little more so a
little bit of a darker shade hey this
one just turned red yeah a little too
bright I think it's infused Carl how do
we save this it's do you feel like your
skin feels I don't have eight Lee just
that almost feel like we have a mask
yeah exactly
I'm trying the new cover-up ah perfect
oh that's probably not new but it's new
to me do you set just where you conceal
their the whole face um the whole face
normally but I said like a lot I'm gonna
under-eye just because I like to
brighten it and you know if you like sit
your vacant a bunch on it'll like help
that area get brighter oh good god my
forehead looks like it's just wet
let's get the wet look and then amo
might take whatever is left on my sponge
and just like about door everywhere yeah
exactly I mean it looks better I don't
like that like it looks like I could
take my fingers screem hundred layers oh
I mean you can't look like a mess you
always do like just maybe a little
better I feel like a weight of the world
is on my face right now
how do you feel not pretty you don't
want to wear this every day never well
oh my god I look like the color of my
sweatshirt yeah you do okay guys well
that is our tested out of the world's
most full coverage foundation get it
just get it Joey
I taught him how to fix me and you look
so good you tried this color yeah no I
want to check it's such a cute new bug
my neck in my face not the same all
right guys well I guess that's it for
this video this was a floral we don't
recommend it well do you recommend I'll
let you decide well I feel like we up I
will say this we definitely never get
the right color oh that was my husband
it did oxidize which wasn't on us right
and then I think or what it's supposed
to be till I cover the brake pores and
stuff I really don't think that it it
did its job yeah I don't either
it was us it was around 12 to 14 bucks
of evening continues expire
our base there growing up 20 years I
think it's weird that a foundation that
lasts for me three years
that's very at home really yeah like
this normally a year of compeition oh
because I feel like there's there's
definitely some like types of
foundations out there that are for
people put like scarves on their
Facebook I don't like that no I mean I
really don't think so because I don't
think no it doesn't work it way to trade
up to oh can you see it yeah yeah I'm
gonna have one did it or anything
okay well the Beautyblender kind of
takes it but okay I mean it kind of does
not 100% it's still like I don't know
anything down there but how are you
gonna blend that in naturally yeah you
can't just slather it on yeah well guys
I just don't recommend it even if you
have some things that you weren't
covered like I don't think the system I
think you can find like there's normal
foundation at your local hardware store
