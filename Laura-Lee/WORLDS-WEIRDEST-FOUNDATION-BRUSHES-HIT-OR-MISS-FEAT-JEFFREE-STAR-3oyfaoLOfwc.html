they have a sense again hi yes what's up
everybody
we're here we're here honey today we're
gonna dive into some crazy stuff we have
some crazy-ass makeup brushes that
actually Deborah found me yes he's like
the master of finding no we both are we
can find some crazy shit online let's
just show off your brush what in the
hell is going on
that was like it a broom what is little
duster it does like should we just flip
her this in the dustpan right and this
one looks like it's like the back so
we're going to do they we're gonna apply
makeup
honestly I'm bare face may never have my
eyes done but this must be a beautiful
is like flawless why the foundation
ahahaha so we found these crazy brushes
online and they're from two different
brands and we're just going to take
foundation we're going to see if they're
even good so this comes the first
impression I get making it so it's like
saying is it worth your money exactly
have a question now my favorite primer
ever is the specifically have you ever
tried it I've never tried it before
oh this is amazing it more like a free
product we're about to get that
virginity going this is her I don't know
why the packaging like I love Sicily I
was in Sicily with Cicely Sicily Sicily
I don't know absolutely everything wrong
at the same all right so this primer is
everything I don't know why it's so good
it's a little pricey to price point
scary way 120 I thought the same thing
I'm like this bullshit and then I was an
Amiga I reviewed it and I was like oh my
god this is amazing but maybe I was
forcing myself so like five videos later
I'm like my skin delayed no way I don't
care and then their skin carrying this
as well it says instant in long-term
let's just put this on so you can use
your fingers you may long dad I want the
next
but you want to like massage it in and
then it starts to get tacky after a
minute what I love techie because I feel
like your foundation stick it sticks on
so good gonna smell like more like cold
hard cash okay so today I'm going to be
using the one by iconic London it was
come on defense on yeah goal that looks
pretty
now it's similar to the palm brush from
our teeth brush yes on a person that is
not as big because you know the palm
press light comes all the way down the
bristles field not a saw oh you know RT
okay there she is doing a comparison
we're going to go ahead okay let me say
I don't know I don't know if it's like
in my head is it in my head come on you
tell me what a finger these brushes like
because that was okay it's not bad it's
just yeah this is completely like really
really flat like me and then this one
has some volume like okay so how much is
this brush this one is only 40 bucks
okay so that's the way you have today
Jeffrey alright so we have the best ma
cosmetic beador Shorthair contour brush
it says you can apply cream makeup so
foundation obviously and it says just to
buff it on it's really easy to use and
it's all synthetic bristles which of
course that is as well allegedly this is
going to seamlessly glide onto my face
and it's going to be very easy it says
that this is inspired by nineteen
thirty's makeup which i love i like the
vintage feel if I go regional you know I
love a brand has innovation yeah it's
like it's all been done before what can
we do next when we go back in time not
really magic topic ISM I didn't make our
life harder way exactly I'd be really
cool now this one is $48 so a little
more pricey than L so I think we're just
going to do a divorce impression on our
face so we're going to use two different
foundations honestly I'm a little more
pale than her I'm like ghastly pale so
today I'm going to be going with the
traceless foundation from Tom Ford
London one of my favorites I love this
one I'm getting a nice on him and Laura
Lee what are you going to bus today
Lamar Lamar the mayor the mayor Rona
mayor saw fluid yeah this is one of my
favorite foundations of all time and
I've heard only and you've never cited
almost acceleration and moment career
yeah I'm gonna dabbed it on my face I've
gotten to my method and there's going to
blend with the brush
great how does it smell to you because
it smells like caramelized like it
smells like um a little bit like bourbon
though okay thing about bourbon hmm I
smell of bourbon and candy so I'm just
going to take a drive Beauty Blender and
you cannot gather around my face okay
let me do a little more on my neck and
we better blend before this shit dries
I'm scare alright so we're going to go
in with this clean brush and let's see
what happen all right
yes Here I am - you better read it to me
brush okay quick Mar not bad like
actually really soft
okay hmm it sounds like you're brushing
I am hahaha what are you thinking
first impressions picking up all the
product honestly like it just snatched
on your face what happened huh I don't
have foundation on anymore
oh girl not come forward
okay okay I'm along with blending
blending it can't be wasting product
look whoa it's like cakes of your
foundation along with yeah I'm like I
snatched up your bag I'm brushing and it
almost like removed my foundation okay
it's Charlie yet I'm kind of tripping
out I don't have foundation on anymore
know what don't you go
girl and match your foundation of your
face and that's about it let's do a
close-up of this brush I would have to
use a lot more products that even get to
stand in your way furniture Shawn for I
know I'm not a little absurd whoa I'm
kind of shocked and the grass isn't
cheap as it is so this little foundation
drink now I know you can also like blend
out contour greens up with this right if
it says apply your foundation and it's
not playing I'm a little worried
this one reminded me so much of the our
teeth brush even the way you hold it um
it was very soft it didn't snatch my
foundation on my face didn't mmm
conditioners gray our radio so yeah that
doesn't sell any product now I'm a
little shaken that just didn't really
work for me I think it was acceptable
for the price I'm like all the products
went on the garage I love this brand but
this is like an epic fail for me right
now I'm wearing foundation I feel like I
need to like even hearing me what just
seems like it's too thick and dislike it
so we're just trying to there for a
laugh on your hand yeah try to brush
that out for a second I'm just going to
go like this okay what happens oh okay
look at the brush I'm so dramatic do you
love my again no I'm like I can't I'm
speechless
I couldn't even guy and literally just
look snatched keep it going
see if it like disperses in a minute
because my face did not disperse so I
think it did disperse it a little honest
or sweet you know but if you look right
here I told that foundation damn buff on
powder or cream formulas with this easy
cheese brush oh I'm gonna give this
wanna know this one is a knot jacket are
approved or a Laura approved you're so
sweet
I'm messing in my wall over them and I
give this one a yes I mean it's fine it
reminds me of it
duper kind of the artist but here you
know what we're going to do is we're
friends yes we're going
man I'm like let me just try a little
bit color on him like just a primer oh
it looks great
okay so now that we have this on okay
you tell me what you think about that
brush oh okay I'm better yeah I actually
have some coverage mm it's not I guess
not they can go to my mouth and he is
covered in foundation before it nothing
was happening
this was nice for me I know your hands
are smaller because you're a real woman
but it's a little small like a grasp on
yeah my risk hmm okay you're having to
clinch hard but it's working you guys
because they actually have foundation on
my skin thank you lord
it's a little weird to hold it in a
little weird hold okay cool this brush
it works
mm-hmm it's good I don't have anything
negative to say about it except it's
just a little eye shape yeah it's almost
like I know your place
how you supposed to do that I think
something like that but there's no way
it looks right at my yes I feel like it
should be a little bigger like I need
some more of a hump out of this and a
rabbit - grandma - stop all right the
next up we're going to share this
because we're friends
yeah my lovely sister Maureen is
carrying that's right this is by the
same brand Besame eight to call this the
same but have been on how to read okay
$50 if you dollars and I've SMA you can
get a lot Sephora just so you guys know
yeah this is called beador long hair
finishing powder brush it has long
bristles for creating a near flawless
airbrush finish near flawless so not
completely flawless what does that even
mean why would you plant in China Mir
well you might be able to be perfect
bitch but you don't pull now this one
compared to the other one our third
across the room and um this one's a
softer yeah it's a nightmare it dense
yeah it says that these are man-made
Bristol ah that's look up any one of my
dog now it said you can use it with
setting powder with
vation powder alright so we're going to
take some foundation powder so what do
you think I should do - oh just like I
didn't say I think you catheter dab it
around yeah
is gonna speak another Oh matches them
up okay
okay harder baby I'll take it works
it's so big though my small baby I know
a lot of big head like it literally
covers and it is it still breasts look
you give you happier deck with my weight
right that's what your whole face so my
goal is a little awkward
yeah for the average girl with a smaller
face it looks like it goes look at the
brush is a product disbursing it's hard
to say honest eggs don't know you know
what I feel like it could essentially be
drinking up a little bit of the powder
down in it okay okay let me try it yeah
you check out I'm like on the fence
about it okay yeah it's picking up a lot
of product all right does it matter okay
oh no that was nice you don't big fucker
oh wow I mean that covered my face
quickly but yeah tell me more
you're so lucky you just swipe it
everywhere your eyebrows are literally
you look for that okay we're gonna trick
it here's the real chair great so my
tags on my neck right let's take us a
lot of product and let's see what
happens to grandma does nothing happen
not really not really anything happened
I mean you know when you're trying to
love something but you're not really
forcing the love right now it kind of
worked but like I'm not in love with
that honestly is definitely something I
know I wouldn't use every day it's just
too big and it drinks up a lot of
products if you're using a high end
expensive powder is the thought okay
well I did since before there are a lot
of reviews thing that like we brush away
like setting powder or baking that it
works on a great quick thought before we
even try that I don't want to brush just
to sweep away my baking right right I
mean if I wanted to sweep a powder away
is like a big brush with airbrush I
don't need my own brush for that moment
alright so we're going to take a drive
Beauty Blender and
going to just put this under my eyes do
a happen same thing okay so let's just
take this off yet let me go first all
right okay okay I'm mad about it
that was nice it was easy I mean this
brush it off really smoothly yeah it's
soft as hell so ah BAM it kind of flows
with your thing - it does I mean it's
easy for that I just don't think it's
worth spending an extra few bucks to
sweep off your powder alright so guys
that is pretty much it
what are your final thoughts I'm so
disappointed
yeah same and I was so excited to get
these like I love new things I love
weird brushes when you look at my makeup
petition I have a smack brush from 12
years ago yeah that's all my sin exists
no this is a Mac alumni things brush 186
it is the best thing ever for packing on
your powder a foundation like I don't
recommend I'm not going to recommend you
guys clown by no I don't think so at all
the iconic want name can potentially be
a do for the artiste brush which I love
that color on yes I hate definitely no
it's definitely not I hate I potentially
recommend it it just depends on what you
like in your application alright guys
that is it for this video
