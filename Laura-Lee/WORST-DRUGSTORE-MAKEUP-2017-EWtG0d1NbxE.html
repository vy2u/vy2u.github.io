you're scared what's got my eyes closed
out but that's okay that's my bike huh
and he's waist kiddush compared to my
gray cat who's like so chill there's
just different type of cats in the world
anyways listen dressed the big elephant
in the room at my pile to die my friend
Nikita dragon is doing wigs with Bellamy
and I'm wearing the blonde one right now
oh they have their lace front and so
they look really real but then I'm just
not good at laying the baby hair so you
can tell it's a wig so that's why I my
yeah okay let's do the intro what's up
guys and welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be as talking about
products that did not work out for me
the drug story you guys always love it
when I talk about products that didn't
work out for me versus always being like
I love this I love that I love
everything in rainbows sometimes things
just don't work out and I gotta keep it
really real with you guys and always
tell you the truth and a lot of brands
actually respect that nowadays so I
appreciate brands that you know
appreciate my honest opinion some RINs
don't but some brands do and I
appreciate it I appreciate that you guys
appreciate my honest opinion let's get
started
Oh actually have a lot to talk about
that's not good let's start with we'll
start with some highlighters actually
have like three highlighters didn't work
out for me we're just gonna knock them
out the ballpark I didn't sing my
subscribe song oh my god we're going
back and we'll go ahead and jump right
into this video now okay highlighters
these did not work out for me these are
by all made this is the instant glow
highlighting duo the liquidy side pretty
much turns out to be like nothing it
like blends out just into light and then
the highlighting side just is not
luminous enough for me by the time you
blend it out Christic highlights are
also a little bit more tricky than
powder highlight I find that these are a
little bit hard to blend out they're
more blinding but once you rub them in
you don't really get that much bang out
of your buck for them so I don't
recommend these to you guys and if you
can see the liquid sides really
a week glow and is almost not even a
glow it's just like a waste of time and
these are kind of pricey from the
drugstore so I don't recommend them to
you guys no I do no way come in yes
the next one you guys might hate me for
because a lot of this one got like a lot
of love but this is the wet while like
the mermaid midnight mermaid
highlighting bar this didn't work out
for me it must be my skin tone I'm more
of a medium skin tone this wig is making
me look a little bit lighter but reality
is I'm a medium skin tone girl
it looks very great kinda like I was
bruised right here whenever you looked
at me head-on they could by turn
sideways completely oh my highlight
today look at my real hair it look
pretty but like head-on and me talking
it just looks so gray and like I almost
got punched in the face because it has
like this era doesn't darkness to it
they really showed up and looks so
awkward so I don't recommend it to you
although I did love that collection
overall the highlight just didn't work
last highlight that didn't work for me
was by NYX we've already gone through
three highlights it's my next this is
away week load this is their liquid
highlighter and again cream and liquid
products it's a little bit sometimes can
be a little bit more difficult to work
with but I found that this one it just
kind of feel like lip gloss to me it's a
highlighter and then once I got it blend
it out I mean it looks pretty right here
in my hand to be honest but I hated it
on my face like it literally moves
around my cream product like he didn't
sit well with it and then the highlight
I personally like a blinding and I like
it just wasn't there for me it just
didn't give me that bling bling that I
love if you like a subtle highlight
honestly still don't really recommend
this to you because it really didn't sit
well with the powder or another powder
the other cream products on my face next
up is the essence all about Matt this is
so fixing compact powder it looks like
this you can get it all to get it at
Amazon it's just a white powder so as
you know most white powders they're
technically translucent and pretty much
invisible on your skin they're not
actually white well my problem with this
one is that it's white and I put this on
my face and I could not get as much as I
blended it in I could not get the color
of it to go away like it remained
white on my skin and I was like
not okay like it lightens my foundation
my two shades and I look like I had a
crazy ring around my neck I win with
went in with it assuming that it would
have been a translucent mattifier but
really it just puts off too much pigment
and it makes your face way too white so
there's so many at the drugstore loose
powders and powders that work out great
this is just not one of them that I
recommend to you next up I don't know
these blushes are still round they were
in my makeup drawer and they shouldn't
have been they should have been like in
my little bin that makeup that yeah I
don't like these and I didn't use them a
lot because I didn't like them so now
it's time to get them out of my drawer
these are the physicians a foreman for
incisions formula Argan wear blushes
love the quality of the actual blush but
here are a few things I hate and you
open it has so much argan all in it and
literally like punches you in the face I
have an itch this is how you eat your
face if your full bee oh it smell and
the argan although they use smells so
strong like men's cologne and it Lily
will give you a headache wearing it and
then the second thing I didn't like
about it so it has like this glitter
gold glitter film on the top of it which
I actually hate it on my cheeks because
it looked like I just punched a little
bit of glitter at the front of my cheeks
I'll show you on this one more but it's
just like one layer of this gold glitter
can you see it more on this one I'm like
you're gonna respond to me through the
screen you can put in the comment
session I really didn't like the layer
of gold glitter on these so with the
smell and the glitter it just didn't
these didn't work out for me but I did
like like the quality and pigmentation
of the actual blush because I'm this one
I got more a little bit more through the
glitter but I recommend it to you
there's a lot of good drugstore blushes
out there another jokes or blush they
recently tried out in my drugstore video
where since no products is the Almay
powder blush this just I really want it
to love these to be real with you guys
but they have so much shimmer in them
they enhance pores you pump you pump a
little blush right here and this is a
really prone area to bear pores or a big
poor area where it shows up so the
luminosity on this was in
handsome of course and not only that I
couldn't get the product to show up I
dabbed in it like ten times and we
finally got a peach peach finish so it's
just not as pigmented as I need it to be
like I need a blush to have a little bit
more than what this is throwing at you
and then the shimmer and it was a to me
I still got some products to talk about
I told you there was a lot I'm still
recovering from Fashion Week in case
you're wondering so my voice is a little
it's because I was trying to get sick
there and I look myself in the soul in
the mirror and I was like you cannot get
sick you better suck it up and get
better right now okay I'm better it
works the next product is this ELF
concealer this did not work for me and I
wanted it to oh my early this is there I
don't know which one it is was the one
that comes to this tube it doesn't have
like a specific name on the bottle but
this product is so thin breezy and
didn't cover anything this was just
all-around up for me I did I actually
hated this product yeah ain't really did
I I didn't like it I don't recommend to
you guys it didn't cover anything and it
was so heavy and greasy it was just like
I immediately when I felt it when I put
it on I was like Maybelline has got some
of the best and L'Oreal to really drug
sourcing and Tiller's so if you're
looking for an affordable concealer from
drugstore check out their set up the age
rewind you can't beat it with a stick
next concealer I didn't like as a
concealer this is a brand new tube yes
because they sent these to me but that's
okay didn't work out for me this is
their brightening concealer and it says
on the package that supposed to have
some coverage it had no coverage
whatsoever and I hated it for the
under-eye like now if you wanted to use
these to contour with they blend out
really easy so I find that it might be a
better contour product if you buy it
like a shade or two darker than your
foundation contour the face it would be
great for that but as far as concealing
the face it was just like oh no coverage
in it whenever I what I want out
concealer is it to be high coverage
creaseless
blend out easy and just overall look
really beautiful and wear beautiful on
the skin it didn't do it for me next up
let's talk about a liner from Elle
this is the intense ink liner mmm got to
get her open so this brush I personally
know this is a personal thing I have a
little bit of trouble with brushes like
this to get my wing right I'm better
with the bristled brush like do the
flick instead of a foam brush why did it
just do the best swatch ever so now I'm
a liar great the problem I had with this
is it believes and not only does it
bleed I have trouble with the one and I
felt like whenever I was doing across my
eyelid it was inconsistent in black ink
so I felt like some of it was watery oh
it's bleeding I can show you about the
bleeding do you see it's like feathering
in the pieces in my hands it kind of did
that on my eyelid where it would just
like kind of feather out and I needed it
to definitely not do that also the black
is super black right there I did do like
a really hard Shh what you're not gonna
do on your eyelid you're gonna be like
you know what I mean
it was just inconsistent blacking so I
didn't like it next I had lastly lastly
we're almost done I have to brow
products that did not work out for me
this is the brow stylist kabuki from
L'Oreal I think this product is for
people who had these beautiful perfect
full bushy brows like mani MUA and not
for people like me who have to fake it
and really draw on and like really focus
on drawing on the brows it looks like
this it's like a big Brush this is a new
one as well I get sent a lot of
drugstore makeup I'm very blessed in
that area I know I'm so sometimes if
something didn't work out for me I get a
new one in and it's just new its new
I've tried before I think I've tried out
my channel before anyways no not the
point of the story I blend it out and it
was so pigmented and you could not get
precise because of how big the pencil on
it is and then the Kabuki on the end
like come on I could blend my eyeshadow
with that I could not do my brow it was
just like a freaking mess stuff was
everywhere it was so immersed and I have
to get precise because I really have to
draw my brows on so I really think this
is just for a person that has beautiful
big brows and they can just like Oh a
few times and uhm and then they're done
which ain't me and that
okay but it ain't me in online product
last product thought the bear is the
Scopes and highlight from NYX I thought
this was a really cool concept in a
product it has the brow pencil on one
end and then it has the sculpting
product on the other end to define the
brows problem that I didn't like with
the sculpt is that it was around so I
would just like color it all over then
take a brush and sculpt it out so there
was a little bit of a flaw I should have
had more of a flat sharper end and then
the product the NYX micro brow pencil is
so good if you're looking for an
affordable brow pencil I really like
that but this brow pencil is not the
same formula I thought it would be and
it's not nearly as pigmented you don't
get nearly as much product off of this
brow pencil so it's a flop it's a floppy
flop flop it's a gimmick okay t-shirts
for sale are Los Angeles I know because
I don't recommend I actually recommend
the micro brow pencil instead of this if
you want a good brow pencil from next
that is it and I just talked so much I
could drink a gallon of water right now
remember that time in the video where
sniff my water bottle to see how old it
was and everyone was like relatable
