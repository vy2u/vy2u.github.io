video is going to be on drugstore makeup
that really did not work out for me
I actually have like a little stash that
I kept to the side and then every time
something didn't work out for me I just
put it in that side and I was left with
this little bucket of makeup that just
didn't really work out for me and hope
so doing a video for you guys and I'd be
saving you some money but promise to
didn't work for me and you know the
usual disclaimer something that it
didn't work for me works for you doesn't
mean everyone's wrong and everybody's
terrible and everything is bad it just
means we're different people and things
just work out differently for different
people I've been doing these videos for
a long time by the way I just got back
from Necker Island with benefit
cosmetics think you benefit that was so
much fun we went on a little brand trip
if you follow me on snapchat girl you
were already in the in and you already
know all the wind-down it was quite
quite I was just so much fun to go on
their ships and be able to spend time
with other youtubers and people that
work on the same project and like in the
same industry as you is just so much fun
to connect and you would have party and
hang out and get to know these people so
just a little life update letting you
guys know what's going on in my life and
I am back with a lot of other projects
that I'm working on currently and it's
going to be a big year for 2017 it's
going to be also a year for 2018 I'm
already working on a couple of things
for that that's enough rambling because
we're going to be doing a lot
chit-chatting in this video so let's go
ahead and jump right in and get started
so this a little so let's get started by
the way I did a Joe source favorites
video recently I'll link down below if
you want to see the product so it did
work out for me from the drugstore check
that out so of course we'll get started
with this weird little sugar mama Baba I
already lost like the lid to it but has
a quickie closed lid this is the
Physicians Formula translucent light
powder and I really wanted this to work
out because it has the same feel as
alarm RCA power it's not like super
translucent where it flashes back but I
wore it and at the end of the day my
makeup was like breaking up into pieces
I think it was a combination of this as
well as makeup that hound underneath my
skin but just like as a total it was
just like a big for me the powder it
looks pretty on my skin it just wasn't
long wearing whatsoever and like sending
your makeup is kind of what you do to
help it stay and
you long-wearing in on slough away and
it was sloughing everywhere and I I
swear to you guys I look to my forehead
that night in the mirror but Oh make it
was like broken up and that doesn't
really happen to me like I don't really
deal with my makeup breaking up on my
skin a lot so I'm not gonna recommend
that to you guys
okay the next product that didn't really
work out for me
the product I didn't like just buy those
are like oh I hate you you know I mean I
mean I didn't love it I thought it was a
little gimmicky and I know you guys love
when I say that word you love it yeah
this is the all May healthy glow
this is a makeup plus a gradual tanner
so it's super innovative and cool and
away free one minute where you pop it
off actually half of this bottle is a
foundation in the other half is the
gradual tanner SPF 20 the whole works
but honestly I wasn't obsessed with the
foundation on my skin it just was a
little heavy feeling and then with all
the sunscreen in it it was much it felt
greasy and heavy honestly and it didn't
wear it wasn't long wearing the product
I just wasn't loving I'm not going to
recommend to you guys it wasn't the
worst thing ever but it was just very
heavy greasy feeling on my skin and on
top of that so half of it is a gradual
tear of the other half is the foundation
and promise you I pumped it like 30
times before the gradual painter so I
came out and I was even beating it like
come on and then finally after I use
like half the bottle just pumping it out
trying to get them to come out together
it came out so I had wasted half of the
foundation side just to get the self
tanner side to come out which in my
opinion that's a big flaw it's a major
waste in product product product and
especially because Alma is not the like
most affordable side of the drugstore
you know another positive didn't work
out for me it's from essence beauty and
I mentioned these a while back like in a
haul video or just like reviewing some
drugstore products from essence by the
way my luggage is like floating around
the world right now I don't have it so I
don't have my extensions and
like my hair is a little flat today and
coming on my extension so our extensions
are in my luggage along with everything
else
rabbit trail anyways these are called a
liquid lipstick from ss beauty it says
it right here liquid lipstick and so I
bought these and I was like holy crap
these are like so affordable they're
cute they're tiny they're pretty colors
a liquid lipstick yet so I bought and
tried them out they are literally a lip
gloss there's nothing like what lipstick
about these and I even get the whip
lipsticks that you put on is too like
kind of a liquid lipstick but it slipped
and it's not kissable and then there's
the liquid lipsticks like I'm wearing
today we're taking actual drying Matt
down liquid lipsticks and then of these
there's a blood out lip gloss and like
why would you call this a liquid
lipstick when that's not what it is and
that's the only thing that like gets me
about these I'm just like I feel like
your consumer will be more happy with
the product if it said lip gloss because
that's what they're actually getting and
I feel like your consumer you know
seeing liquid lipstick definitely don't
expect like a pure lip gloss to be the
result so I just thought that was so
silly in this leading of the product I
do like the lip gloss is super heavy
pigmented so you could wear it alone
I just sought the name of it all I just
need to be redone because I thought it
was just super misleading and I don't
recommend that to you guys unless you
want to lip gloss but that's like
confusing if you get what I'm saying so
just a heads up on that just throwing
that information out there into the
world now you know okay what is next I
put quite a few products here so let's
just keep going
next up is a product that I kind of used
to love but I don't think I wasn't
experienced in makeup I just want to say
that I hadn't played with a lot of
compact of concealers and cream products
so I thought this was a really good one
until I started playing with other ones
Malphite oh girl the thing is and this
is in the next correct conceal contour
palette definitely dabbled in the
concealer more those contour to the
contours too dark for me but this
product right here is like cake it'll
literally want to dig into this is like
rubber
almost is so thick and it's very hard to
get blended out on your skin I
definitely am doing a lot of pressure
with my finger but could you imagine a
brush trying to burn
is out you would definitely have to mix
it with some type of elixir or something
to get this cake blended out all a
reality else makes it super affordable
cream contour palette and they're much
more blendable and soft than this I mean
the coverage is super heavy which is
like the usage of the product it's like
impossible and I don't think I think it
looks a little muddy and stick on the
skin because of the thickness of the
quality of it so the actual product I
just don't care for I don't work them
into you guys so don't say I didn't tell
you each was a poop the next product
while we're talking about cream contour
and all that yes is the opposite of the
situation this is my Jordana cosmetics
at the sculpting go and actually they're
highlighting stick like this and I love
it it's super soft very beautiful blends
out easy and this sonic blends out super
easy and I actually adore the color of
this contour is seriously perfect for my
skin tone it's so pretty
but then once I started blending it out
onto my skin it almost vanished into
nothing so this product was kind of a
waste of money and it was literally so
affordable I think I paid like three
dollars for this so the best thing about
the product is that it blends out so
friggin easy the bad thing is like it
disappeared on my skin I feel like my
brushes or Beauty Blender did substrate
right up in it just like disappears off
of your face because the product doesn't
have a lot of pigmentation in it so it's
always some money the highlight one's
amazing get the highlighting one not the
contouring one and that's all I'm gonna
say about it the next product I'm going
to talk to you guys about are these
little balls of elf cosmetics these are
just natural and it's supposed to just
add a little color to your skin you can
use some kind of like a bronzer however
they have like blush highlight and
bronzers one it's just like a mixed
product that you can allure - dropped
one I'll be sure to step on that later
it's just so gimmicky like it's silly
because the product has no pigmentation
whatsoever I've beaten my brush down in
here and it does nothing you get nothing
on your skin this is a waste of money
like this is this is nothing this is the
balls of nothing oh it's just kind of
silly I remember like back in the day
these you should be really popular I
think Tuesday's made one um they're a
little more pigmented but these used to
be popular and now they're just like
silly you know what I mean just give me
some press powder girl let's roll with
it
that
as a BB concealer from Physicians
Formula and it has like this similar to
the Milani and top with a sponge and
whole let me show you why I don't care
for it do you see where I was poured out
like so gross I mean you obviously have
to shake it but still the product is so
wet and greasy that's why I don't care
for it like no it separates underneath
my eyes and it doesn't leak Rhys because
he's just so wet so it is more so like
falls apart and separates under my eyes
and it's just like gross honestly
there's too much grease in this product
I mean obviously that's super wet squirt
is also more so it need to be shaken up
that's just like a prime example about
like what's in the product it's just
like so holy and greasy and it's pretty
gross to put on the under eye I don't
like the sponge as you can see I just
scored out on my hand and like got it on
my under eye was like oh so heavy I only
used a couple times and all my girl we
are done with this product we are done
okay the next product that has been
around for a minute now and I'm still
not loving it and and whenever I first
you know got it I was like it's okay
it's pretty good like it's a decent
drugstore palette but reality is this
towel is $20 and I just don't think it's
worth the price the more that I fiddle
with it and the more that I see it I
avoid using it and it is that
left-handed tube by L'Oreal this fella
is honestly for lack of better words a
bit of a ripoff it's because of the
price I just don't get once twenty
dollars like that's not fair drugs for
pricing in my opinion Djoser pricing
keeps going that way they're no longer I
mean white why not just go to Sephora
you know that's just my opinion and the
mats are super pigmented until you start
to like rub them out okay are you ready
and then you deal with the patchy Ness
the pet my fingers even passed you from
smashing it they are the patches matte
eyeshadows and like the finger swatches
you're like oh yes color and then you
just do a real nice watch work really
hard on blending that out I'm gonna show
you my finger and my hand like do you
see blotches and patchiness is a joke
and then the shimmers honestly don't
have that much pigmentation I don't
think it's like
the worst thing you could ever use you
know but it's just very hard to blend
out and I feel like now we have better
options at the drugstore NYX makes great
eyeshadow else has came out with a
couple things great I chose what
involves really affordable eyeshadow
palettes is nowhere near $20 is fabulous
and mats are fabulous in it these they
feel so soft but you know when you blend
them out there's a patchy nightmare and
the shimmer time of a pigment so I
definitely recommend this you guys it's
just that's a joke to me in my opinion
the product it didn't work out for me
was one from Maybelline this is the
brightening creamy concealer and a lot
of people whenever I said I didn't like
this in the past because I think I've
mentioned it before they're like la it's
not supposed to cover dark circles it's
just supposed to brighten but then I did
research and yes it says it's supposed
to cover dark circle okay okay it does
not cover anything it's a great product
to contour with if you want to get like
a darker one and like cream contour with
they blend out super easy and actually
the pranic link doesn't disappear as you
blend it out it isn't enough coverage so
if you want to contour with it and just
add some dimension to your face maybe
get some a couple shades darker than
your skin tone do some contouring have a
good day with it that's fine but
actually like using it to cover dark
circles that was a hard note for me girl
my bags or darker than ever they were
steering right through it was just
something that is not for this girl
right here yes I just don't like of it I
just don't know I don't know
the next product I'm gonna mention to
you guys you're probably going to like
slaughter me for saying I don't like it
because every time I say I don't like it
people do with but that's fun
you know that's okay this is a baked
blush this is a baked highlighter from
else and people you know this is super
affordable it doesn't work if it will
say oh Laura you're doing it wrong you
need to wet it like nothing you have to
wet it for it to work and I wet it and
it still doesn't work and they're like
Oh Laura you have to scrape the top off
which work I'm like girl I'm done if I
have to do that many things to get it to
work why would I just go buy the wet and
wild petals highlight the works
fabulously about the same price and you
don't have to do anything to it to get
it to work and then that's just my
opinion on it I just think you have to
do so much to this to even get any color
to come off of it that it's just like
so I don't recommend they'll fake
highlighters and the last product that I
worked out for me was a primer this one
is from covergirl this is the primer for
oily skin and during the summer time my
skin gets just a little bit greasy
around the forehead area and so I
thought this product would be great
because it's super lightweight but at
the same time by the time I rubbed it
out
literally I have like no old control and
like did nothing to like help the oil
issue out it feels a little bit greasy
honestly and I'm like well I may feel
super lightweight at the same time it
almost has like this very thin sheered
glaze to it that feels a little bit
greasy which already had me on the edge
and in my forehead was just this degrees
is it was any other day so as a primer
this did nothing specifically great it
doesn't help hydro pores it didn't help
me out with degrees if reminds like you
didn't I don't think it harms my skin
but and do anything to help my skin so I
was just like why I don't recommend this
to you guys that is it for this video
I feel like I talked a whole lot I
hopefully this video is not going to be
too too long but it's just me spin some
truth on how it feels awesome products
hope you guys enjoy it don't forget to
