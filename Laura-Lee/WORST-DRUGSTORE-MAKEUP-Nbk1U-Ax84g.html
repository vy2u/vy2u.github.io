about drugstore products that did not
work for me and also I want to announce

jump into the video I think that's all
the announcements I have for you guys
I'm so excited to be talking about
products that didn't work for me in
hopes that they may save you some
pennies at the drugstore if you were
thinking about buying these things and
also we'll go into detail as to why they
didn't work for me without further or do
we're gonna subscribe we're gonna get
subscribed
well that just tells you I want you guys
to subscribe how many of you already
knew that was dr. pepper probably a lot
of you guys we're gonna go ahead and
jump in the video and let's get started
now
alright guys jumping right in first I'll
go ahead actually I'm going to go ahead
and start with Kardashian beauty I
tested out this no apologies liquid
makeup and it actually feels like a
really nice liquidy foundation it's on
the drugstore section and uLTA Beauty
and then I tart it out and once I got it
spread out it didn't have a lot of
coverage and that's not necessarily the
reason I didn't like it but I really
don't like it because it's separated on
my skin and I don't have all the skin I
would say my skin is normal but this
product just I don't know it's separated
and my skin didn't look nice and it
wasn't very long wearing so it didn't
work I have indigestion it didn't work
for me and I don't know if any of you
guys have tried this out before if you
had any luck with it
comment down below let your friends know
but as for me I didn't care for this
foundation for the drugstore a lot of
people ask me you know what are my
favorite drugstore foundations and maybe
in a future video we can talk about that
like a dedicated
video I really need a makeup white it's
all over me
ah so that was a poop product for me as
far as foundation next we'll move on to
foundation powder and I did like this
product for a little bit trying it out
you know wasn't so bad and I I kind of
liked it and then I kept kind of going
with it and trying it out this is the
covergirl clean matte foundation powder
now I think that it could potentially
work for people with very Olli skin and
it just overcompensated trying to be
matte for me and I know this sounds a
little bit confusing cuz you're like
what do you mean overcompensating that
was just something a product for me and
that's because it I've set my makeup
with it and I just tried to like drink
up all the foundation honestly like it
just it felt like it was like all the
foundation and I feel like it was trying
to drink up oil or just make my face
like really matte which I don't actually
really careful care for that look I like
a little bit glad you guys say this is
it my face get up yeah it was just way
too drawing way to Matt for me I don't
see myself ever using it anymore so this
did not work for me
extra Maybelline the graffiti nudes
palette so I'm out to be real honest
with you guys I'm always real honest I
fail um these like nudes palettes from
Maybelline they just I never have really
much luck with them and I like actually
blending the eyeshadows with a brush
they just dust into nothing even with an
eye primer and then the shimmers aren't
the end of the world bad like I'm gonna
be honest like they're doable shimmery
eyeshadows they're not my favorite but
they're not the end of the world bad
mind you that's a finger swipe not and a
brush swipe the glitter ones they are no
good
they are not they don't have a
consistency and texture and they're very
chunky and glittery ones but the
shimmery ones aren't so bad but the
matte I don't like nor do I like the
glittery ones and so this was a product
for me a little poop a which leads us to
the next eyeshadow palette which I
mentioned this guy in my
since beauty review video where I go
through and I review a bunch of essence
beauty products if you haven't seen that
I'll link it down below for you to check
out today this is the how to make nude
eyes palette and it's really cute and
honestly the product you remind me of
benefit I opened it and I was like oh
how pretty and then all the shadows are
shimmery so as I was saying in the
essence video I don't really like it
when all the shadows are shimmery
because I always like to incorporate a
mixture of matte and shimmers in my look
these are not that pigmented and they
kind of dust away is nothing so I
definitely did not care for these and I
don't recommend her to you next we're
gonna this is so rare like I never
talked about eyelashes I don't like
because I feel like it's kind of just
like a random thing but these eyelashes
and kind of funny story behind the elf
eyelashes is these are the first
eyelashes to start getting into because
they're a dollar and the our deals were
like six and seven dollars at the
drugstore so I like to practice with
these and have something to mess up and
it wouldn't break my bank so I actually
do recommend these to you if you don't
ever wear false lashes you're gonna play
with them cuz the glue can get all of
them you can twist home bend them and
mess them up you're not gonna be
heartbroken at the end of the day but as
far as from me I just I wouldn't wear
them now that I feel like I'm mastered
false lashes because I wear them like
every day that's just me though you
don't have to wear them every day they
look so fake II they're like the most
unreal false lashes and there's kiss
Beauty Ardell I'll or like there's all
kinds of drugstore eyelashes that are
bomb-diggity and it's like these are
literally just like the fakey is false
lashes because they don't feather it
look like someone just took scissors and
cut them across so I really don't like
the way these look and they're just like
up for me the next poopoo product for me
is the Argan we're car sha I'm 90% sure
I'm saying that wrong and I'm also 100%
sure that you guys are going to correct
me in the comments section below but
it's kaj al kasha
cha-cha-cha-cha
this is an eyeliner from what am i
thinking this is an eyeliner from this
is schwarmann aa light bulb I like the
sisters formula ave but this eyeliner it
has argan oil in it I feel like that
might be the reason it's a little bit
runny I didn't necessarily it ran a
little bit on my list is anybody else
have this problem if you put an eyeliner
on your eyelids and then open your eyes
or squint and like a little bit of
hooded Miss happening like the liner
bleeds up in here that happened with
this so oh look a little tassel a little
that happened with this product an and
it I was just like oh we can never have
to happen again and then also kind of
blood down on my lower lash line it's
just a very runny situation for me I'm
not very long weary and like I said I
think that might be because of the argan
'el in it so it just didn't work out for
me
next pipe didn't work out for me it's
from essence beauty and I mentioned this
already again in that video but I tested
out their liquid lipsticks and these are
not liquid lipsticks these are lip
glosses and that's what I'll have to say
about that you shouldn't name your lip
glosses liquid lipsticks there's nothing
liquid lipstick about this that's a lip
gloss
so let's gloss elf this guy didn't work
for me I was actually excited this is
like their aqua line and it's like new
kind of innovative for elephant and you
know just like a cool affordable product
but whenever I got it I get off me it's
cream and I found the product a little
bit hard to blend out and it appeared on
my skin a little bit muddy looking I'm
just not in love with it I don't like
the texture of the product so it's just
not my fave and then the cream blush is
way too intense I don't care for it I
really love their powder duo that looks
similar to this and I really love their
cream contour palette this guy right
here is not my friend okay
the next product that didn't work out
for me is by flower beauty which is a
line at Walmart if you guys haven't seen
it actually majority of their products
I've tried out have been a hit this one
was a Miss and it's like their cream eye
shadow stick and the reason it's a Miss
for me because I'm like pressing really
hard on my hand to blend this out to get
that product on here and then whenever
you kind of
put out with your finger a little bit
mind you that's a lot of product
it literally blended out and disappeared
to nothing oh my gosh out away over I'm
gonna have to say no on this like
literally because you know you would
color it on your lid and then tap it out
and it just it disappeared almost like
nothing was on my eyelid so I don't
recommend the eyeshadow Chubby's from
flower beauty I've two more products
next one that didn't work out for me is
by elf cosmetics - sorry elf
I'm just not showing you guys love today
I had three elf products in this one it
is their concealer I may have mentioned
this before if I'm a repeater I'm sorry
okay I'm sorry
this is the ELF concealer stick and this
reminds me a lot of the color pop
concealer sticks or highlight pins
because they blend out to nothing it's
like the same situation with the chubby
like I colored under my eyes with this
and then I blended it out and I don't
know like once I had it all blended out
it was just so transparent you can see
through it it didn't cover much it was
like blending out to nothing it's
supposed to be a lightweight concealer
so maybe that's part of it but that's
definitely not what I look for in
concealer and if I put this much product
to my face I definitely want it to
provide some coverage
I ain't coverage out of it I was a
little bit like E my next one and last
one the L'Oreal infallible sculpt this
is a liquid liner and it looks like this
and the tip of it is a ball I know you
see that what is that and what am I
supposed to do what is to me it's not
very consistent especially giving your
eyes like some of the black is like
lighter or darker so it's not like a
consistent jet-black line you get out of
it so the actual formula I wasn't
obsessed with and then the ball on the
end is way too gimmicky for me and you
definitely I definitely couldn't create
a wing with it I know not everybody
wears wing liner so you might like it
going across your eye it's just you
gimmicky for me and it wasn't consistent
in color so L'Oreal has really good
eyeliners too but this just isn't one of
them and I didn't it didn't work out so
I actually had a good bit of product
talk to you guys about what what what
god
I just spilt half this cup of dr. pepper
all in my makeup drawer and my whole
entire artist Couture highlight powder
dumped upside down in my brush door like
in the morning right now for the loss of
products we do deserve it Oh anyway so
that happened and we're gonna have a
great day today so yeah at the end of
the video but I also just want to talk
to you guys and I want to start
implementing more positivity whether it
be on my channel my snapchat my
Instagram wherever there's just so much
negativity I feel like it's boosted more
now than ever on the internet on YouTube
there's so much negativity and like at
each other
Instagram Twitter is like a nightmare in
itself Facebook I mean like the
negativity is just like filling the
internet full and we lay in our beds at
night and we scroll through our phones
and we drill it in our head fights
negativity rumors drama snatching shade
it's never-ending
and I feel like we think it doesn't
affect us mentally but at night whenever
that's like the last thing we all see
like laying our beds going through our
foam it's drilled into our heads and I
think it affects us during the day it
could affect how we treat people around
us and I can't stand it makes me sick
and I'm so frickin sick and tired of
saying it I don't know what to do so I
figure the best fix for it in the world
is to trip positivity throughout my
daily life and hopefully people at night
will see that on their feet and maybe
inspire them to have a positive day or
to lighten up their mood or have a
little bit of happiness in their life so
follow me on this journey of positivity
in this year I know it sounds cheesy and
it's like we're gonna be happy today
I know happens like I get it life
happens but um I just really important
to me to use my platform for the better
and I'm gonna use my platform to you
know spread positivity and be happy and
enjoy my life and I hope you'll follow
along and do the same with me I love you
guys so much thank you for your support

my giveaway and with
