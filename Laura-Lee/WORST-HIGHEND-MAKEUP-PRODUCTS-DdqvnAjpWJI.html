welcome to okay
I am so much today anyways yeah today's
video is going to be a product
disappointing product sponsor didn't
work out for me in parts I don't
recommend for you all the same things I
like to do this video every now and
again we talked about so much parts
tonight live on my channel and so I
think it's fair to talk about products
that didn't work out for me and
potentially save you some of yo dolla
dolla bills y'all that's fair right I
always said this disclaimer in and I
don't even know why I put this
disclaimer in anymore I just do if
something didn't work out for me that
works out for you don't feel bad about
it we're all different and we use
products differently and our skin is
different so that doesn't mean you're
going to anything wrong it just means
we're different paint ball okay we're
going to keep it moving and let's go
ahead and jump right in and get started
okay to get started on this video first
I actually have quite a few products to
talk about first I'm just going to go
ahead and talk about the hidden
foundation me and Jeff reviewed this on
my channel if you want to know more
about it check out that video it's a
foundation and I think it's just a
little bit gimmicky and it comes in a
sponge it's super bizarre so it comes in
four shades and a lot of you guys
explain to me this is a Korean brand and
that's why they only have four light
shades and no other shades and I still
just don't think that's fair if you have
a full line on Sephora to only have that
many shade so I mean justify it as you
want to personally if you want to go
spend your money on it that's I'm not
going to try to stop you I'm just
stating the points and let you take that
information and do what you want with it
but as for me I don't recommend it and I
think it's quite expensive for the tiny
a bit of makeup that you get so this was
a big miss for me and I don't recommend
it to you at home the next product that
I don't recommend to you is the amazing
concealer illuminate so this is by
amazing cosmetics and they used to be at
Ulta I don't know if they're still there
I find that this concealer is quite
crazy under the under eyes and it looks
very wet it was just really hard to
blend out whenever I first put it on the
concealer just had like a lot of cover
so I was excited about it and then it
was just like so grazing got really
difficult and sticky to blend out so I
wasn't
assess with it I just felt very wet and
heavy under eye you can tell that's like
super just like a wet thick product and
I typically go for something a little
more lightweight and creamy for my under
eye the next product that okay this is
kind of an odd situation because the
actual product worked out well for me I
can't talk today well for me what Laura
at the component with a little bit of a
bust so this is the touch in SOL
medalist liquid foil glitter shadow duo
beautiful product beautiful eyeshadow
really hate the component now I like the
component on the cream side is actually
excellent it just comes on this really
odd stick doe foot applicator but it
still works to apply it to your eyelid
I'm going to show you how pretty that is
your like it is a hate video or a love
video law you're kind of twisted but it
dries pretty seamlessly on the eyelid
now when it comes to the pigment side
which I really love the pigna on these
this is such a freaking flaw you have to
like scoop out the powder on this weird
bindi thing and it shoots out everywhere
you can barely get any pigment out so
what I end up doing is dumping a little
bit of the pigment out and honestly I
either get way too little or way too
much it's never good in between and I
normally waste half the product getting
it out so I think it's just such a
gimmicky situation of the pigment and
it's very salty and I don't like it but
if you can see if you can get the right
amount and get it on your eyelid look
how beautiful the product is they're
just not cheap and I feel like I've
wasted I have like two or three of these
and I feel like I've wasted majority
trying to use them so the information is
out there for you guys you can debate
they're worth ear dollar bills but yeah
that's a four and that's where I bought
these moving right along
oh our verdict a has been coming out
with some really pretty products lately
however this one just is not working for
me this is a special effect it's like a
glitter lift topper situation and the
thing I really don't like about these is
they feel like sand on your lips are not
smooth kind of feels a little bit gritty
I find that they're also I think it's
just because there's so much color that
I put in these are so friggin patchy on
the lips I kind of ruin my lipstick when
I rub them on there I honestly just
prefer this you a lift offers over these
I find that they
one like a gloss and this is just like a
weird patchy glitter situation on the
lips so I don't think they're worth my
money I mean grannies are really pretty
but do you see how like uneven and it's
just going to take days to get that even
on the skin so I don't recommend this to
you guys they just were a bit of a flaw
for me and a lot of work and they just
ended I'm not looking so hot okay okay
let's move on next up for me I got these
pure sponges out of a beauty box and
these sponges are so hard like I
literally think I could throw it and
knock a hole in the wall they just
almost hurt your skin too one with it I
really like the cut shape bubble and
like the egg shapes great and all they
do expand as you use them but it's still
wet it's even it's so hard on my skin so
I used a little red one but or the pink
one and I haven't been using these two
at all just because I'm like oh girl if
you looking for an affordable sponge
I like the Real Techniques in the Eco
tools and the morphe blenders I think
all those are great affordable options
for a sponge next up is the unicorn old
don't really need to say anything about
this we'll move on next up is the it
cosmetics competent confidence in your
glow now I love it cosmetics and most of
the products have been hit for me lately
and actually they came out with three of
these pallets and this is the only one
that really didn't work for me it is the
shade range the kicker is it didn't work
for me and I put it on him in our video
where I did his makeup and we broke like
you just absolutely couldn't see like
that all three of them it was just like
a bus like this was invisible this was
invisible and the highlight was just as
a dull is well I have nothing to compare
it to but it was dull okay and so I
really didn't like this one now the
other ones I find are a little bit more
pigmented and the kicker is he is such
an opposite skin tone with me he's very
light and it didn't work out on him and
that's hard on me and girl I didn't work
out on me so I'm like Oprah moving on by
the way the name of this one is instant
nude gulo it's just like invisible and I
just think it would be a waste of money
on a pretty much invisible product on
yes base the next poop for me is dosa
colors actually love those colors I know
I say this
level their Roddick's I do we're just
telling this one product with a huge
doodoo for me and I actually love these
shadows they came out with this ones in
shade frozen it's called their ideal duo
and the top is a cream that you can put
down a cream base and then pack on the
pretty pigment too I wore this the other
day and as I was editing my video I was
like girl the chunkiness was unreal it
was like flaking down on my eyeliner it
was like chunks of pigment it looked a
hot mess now they happens in shell and
like a cranberry one as well and it's so
pretty and it doesn't really do that but
this one frozen I don't know if the
pigment is more glitter than it is
actual pigment but it was so chunky and
it flaked all day long even with the
base down so I mean I do in essence
recommend these to you but just frozen
girl you might want to skip it because
it was a bit of a mess the next thing
I'd argument to you is by Sigma Beauty
this is the brilliant shimmer cream now
I say I mean you can use a shimmer cream
however you want to it's a highlighter
as an eyeshadow I mean like whatever you
want to do with it is as an eyeshadow
and I found I was like actually obsessed
whenever I open this up and then I kind
of swatched it also oh I mean it looks
pretty right but then as I blended it
out on my eyelid it was like honestly a
little like nothing was on my eyelid and
it was super disappointing um a kind of
lights are picking it up kind of sort of
pretty now not really I found it to be
pretty much invisible on my eyelid with
not much pigment at all so I don't
recommend the brilliant shimmer creams
to you guys I don't think of that
pigmented and I definitely don't find
myself reaching to use them ever next up
is a product from dermablend that I
don't recommend to you guys I actually
had a little bit of a mess with this
product just as their setting powder and
this is one of the super translucent
ones and I used it and I took some
photos on my Sony with the flash and go
I was a freaking mess my under eye was
stark white so I think this would be a
cool product of yours where it's going
you know you're not going to be taking
any pictures with a flash but if you
wear this to any
prom I mean just anything you're going
to be using a flash it can be a truly
truly a nightmare it did set the makeup
well but it definitely has that horrible
kickback and there's just so many good
ones il nailed it aren't this
translucency and don't give you that
flash bag so it's like what's the point
in using one that would give you a flash
bag that's that's what I'm getting at
and lastly we have another cream
eyeshadow I'm just on it with cream
eyeshadows with j22 cream eyeshadows I
didn't like yeah I did the milk makeup
cream eyeshadows girl it's got to be
right or I'm walking because I cannot
stand the creepy flakey eyelid I can't
do it um I'm gonna tell you I'm
particular about that I just hate that
look and the milk makeup has some of the
prettiest shades and cream pigments that
I've ever seen in my life I'll go ahead
tell you that the shades are like whoop
the shade range and the pigmentation
that you get out of them are phenomenal
but the freaking front look how
beautiful that is it's like sickening
and by the way this one isn't shade
peepshow but reality of the situation is
if you can see like eyelids are not like
hand they crease up they fold so it
looks really pretty on the ham and I'm
telling you once I was wearing it on my
eyelid blinked a few times you know how
that I live fold it was so creasing even
when it dried it crease and then the
flaking begin and it looked like a
freaking hot mess so disappointed just
because of how beautiful you know it's
watching with my hand I'm like oh my
good and then I got it on my eye and
actually did like a wear test and worn
out and it was just such a hot-ass mess
or a bit of a bus I mean look how
beautiful that is
but sadly like the way it wears was just
not performing well so yeah that is a
wrap for this video these are products
that absolutely did not work out saw may
and I hope this video helped you out and
send you some dollar bills yo I love you
guys so much thank you so much for being
here and watching and I'll catch you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
