video is going to be my worst products
of 2016
unfortunately I get rid of majority of
my products that don't work out for me
so whatever I was like okay you guys
want to see the video well I got rid of
most of stuff like that I talked about
that didn't work out for me so guys my
mic just went out on me in the intro
which sucks but I still have a lot of
products that didn't work out for me to
talk to you about and that's we're gonna
do in this video without further ado
we're gonna get started okay like I said
I got rid of products that didn't work
out for me
kind of screwed the pooch on that one
I'll link some of my other videos though
down below with products that were rated
or didn't work out for me that you can
check out so we'll get started
first product to mention is by Kevin
Kwan this product is raved about and so
of course I went and bought it and it is
pricey and it is just as tiny as it
looks on camera and this is a great
contouring sculpting powder and shade
medium I was very excited about it but
when I opened it I was like that looks
like I like cool tone I only contour
with cool tone but that looks like cool
cool tone so then I started contouring
my face with it
and I looked a little harsh on camera
but I was like okay you know what
everybody says this is great it's got to
be great and then I looked in the mirror
like in my bathroom it looked like I
straight-up put dirt all over my face
like I looked crazy I immediately had
taken make a wife and take my makeup off
like it wasn't even fixable this stuff
is rough I will never use it again I
used it once and I'll never go back to
it because my experience was pretty
rough with it especially the price I
paid for it I probably should have
returned it but oh well water under the
bridge now that I recently discovered
that I didn't like is the morphe setting
powders I love morphe they're great
affordable brand who makes a lot of
absolutely amazing products for a great
price that's the best part about morphe
you can get things for such a good price
that are good quality but these just did
not work out for me truth be told I have
one of these on I had the banana one on
right
and I had to redo my setting powder I
did a recent tutorial where I you know
set half my face with this one the half
Instagram half everyday makeup and I was
looking a mess it was turned orange on
me which was weird and when I guessed
away I was very patchy and uneven I will
never use it again
and then the translucent one is just
such a fine grain translucent powder
that it's like most definitely going to
flash back on you on camera and being in
the YouTube industry I am on camera all
the time and I'm using ply for the time
and this is just a nightmare waiting to
happen
and then this one just looked a hot mess
on me so I don't recommend these little
babies to you well what is next let's
talk about lippies the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks i tried them for so long to
make them work because again there are
just six dollars and i wanted them to be
a great product but they're just so
drying and I found myself never touching
them for the specific reason I don't
want my lips crusty crust um these are
just too drying to join I can't wear
them anymore my lips just can't handle
it like it would look like seriously so
cracky and gross these in general just I
can't do it I you know I would rather
spend $18 on one really good one then
buy 3 of these and have a mess on my
lips so the price point is great the
amount of product you get is great the
actual product I don't like next is the
Urban Decay these are the moon dust
these are I think these are moon dust
eyeshadows are called and let me just
explain myself on this one because I
don't hate these like all around the
board but I hate them as an eyeshadow
like I like these as a glitter because
as an eyeshadow they crease they're a
mess they don't have great pigmentation
as a glitter they're pretty much
everything so if you just try to apply
it to your lid wet or even like with a
primer down after me I went to an event
with one of these on my eyes and I came
home looking a freaking mess girl and so
now I was really scared to use them but
then I used them with glitter glue as a
glitter and they were beautiful they
come off like a pigment I don't know
when she like white that you see how
it's like it's like very patchy but then
I put on glitter glue and like pack
on really tight with my finger and it
was beautiful on my eyelid but as an
eyeshadow who was a hot mess so I'm just
warning you if you want to get these
more so as a glitter they're great as an
eyeshadow they just don't work out for
me I have a few concealers that didn't
work out for me one is the Oprah this is
their sculpting wand which I think
they're supposed to be used for like
contour and highlight as well as
concealer this is too drying very drying
cracky my under-eye look very patchy and
just like needed some help so didn't
work out for me and then the brightening
creamy concealer by Maybelline these
just came out but they didn't work out
for maybe just because they didn't have
enough coverage for me majority of the
time pencils don't work out for me I
like cream concealers anyways but I gave
it a try and it didn't cover anything
for me as far as the darkness my
under-eye so yeah I haven't tried to
contour with ease yet but like I
mentioned in my review video they could
be a great contouring products they
blend it out really nicely so we'll see
so hang tight on that they may be good
for that and then the milk concealer
unfortunately it looked a hot mess it
was just way too greasy summer way too
dry this one's just way too wet and
greasy on the other eye I didn't I
didn't have like uh creasing problems I
just oh yeah I did have a little bit of
creasing problems but I'm also had like
it was separating on my eye just cuz
there's so much grease behind it so I
don't recommend to you next another
product - just let me explain myself on
is this Mac concealer this is the studio
finish concealer which so many makeup
artists use and so many makeup artists
use this to carve out the brows and to
use it as an eye primer like while
they're at it but I thought I would jump
on board and buy me one and try it and I
like it for the under eye and I'm really
lucky to carve out brows but as an
eyeshadow primer
I was looking so bad girls and guys it
was so crazy it was all over the place
my eyeshadow was literally I had the
biggest creases just with this alone so
then I've had it out and put the
eyeshadow on and my eyeshadow was
everywhere it was so crazy it was just a
hot mess oh look my mic went out on me
again cool let's do a funky dance about
it anyways there's one more
what I want to talk to you about that
didn't work out for me is this urban
decay it's like the trio highlighter set
and I really didn't like it the products
have no pigmentation and also did was
leave chunks of glitter on my face so
awesome telling you right here is that I
don't recommend it
see there see how it doesn't have any
pigmentation yeah it'll work out for me
but on a serious note I really don't
recommend it and I was very unhappy with
it let's get on with video for mascara
actually has like so many mascaras that
didn't work out for me this year and I
also had so many that were amazing this
year but I got rid of them because I'm
Laura and that's what I did this one
didn't work out for me and I don't know
why I was still in my last drawer so I
mention it to you this one is the Rimmel
London lash accelerator which is so many
people's ride-or-die this should be like
an overrated beauty products of the year
um but it didn't do anything I just
heard the doorbell rang and girl that is
my phone who didn't do anything at all
for my lashes like it was the wine the
bristles aren't really thick it's like
really thin bristles so wouldn't snatch
my lashes up and it felt really wet and
slick so not for me and then this
product I mentioned earlier this year
and the reason I still have it is
because I really want it to work a lot
of people love this bronzer um but I
felt like the product was so compacted
in the compact I couldn't actually get
any bronzer out there I try to lick
everything that's weird I need to stop
doing that it's probably not healthy to
try to lick everything um I couldn't get
the product out like I was digging my
brush in it and I couldn't get it out
which is weird because they're new
highlighters or in the exact same
packaging and like form but they're so
like one little swiping yudish so much
pigmentation is unreal and i really
really really like the color of this
bronzer but i just feel like i can't get
enough off um I haven't done it yet but
I plan on scraping the top of it and
then dig it down in there because have
you ever realized that like products get
more pigmented the more you use them
like get down in it like the powder gets
looser so that's what I hope to do with
this plus the packet hangs everything so
this is like a love-hate thing like I'm
going to make this work it's just like I
feel like there was a little bit of
manufacture problem with packing it into
kite to get the product out and that is
it that's all that I had on deck but I
kept around that didn't work out for me
the rest of the stuff like I had gotten
rid of like I said ten times in this
video sorry about that I get like a
d-minus being a beauty guru and I hope
