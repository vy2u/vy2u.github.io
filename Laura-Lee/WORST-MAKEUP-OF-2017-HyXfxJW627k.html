channel welcome back if you're new to my
channel I'm Laura Lee and today we're
gonna be talking about the makeup that
didn't work out for me for 2017 so I
have a bad bin of makeup and basically
whenever I would do a review and
something didn't work out I would just
place in the bad bin so we can do a
recap at the end of the year but my bad
been kind of got put away with my
regular makeup whenever we moved this
went through and pulled out products
that I specifically remember that I do
not like and didn't work out for me
these products will be donated for
someone else to try because just because
it didn't work out for me doesn't mean
everyone's gonna hate it and I like to
go in and explain why it didn't work out
for me versus just saying it's bad in
that way you guys understand and also it
doesn't mean the brand just sucks
altogether it just means the product
didn't work oh it's that we got a tray
of makeup to do more I could have put a
lot more in this video but I decide not
to make it an hour long video so I'm
limited down to what really I just did
not enjoy so with that being said we're
gonna go ahead and sing the SUBSCRIBE
song and now we're gonna go ahead and
jump right into the video
so the first product that one are we
talking about is the Stila stay all day
foundation plus concealer and this
product didn't work out for me I felt
like the foundation was heavy but didn't
cover very well and I felt like the
concealer was a little bit greasy so I
don't recommend this product I think
it's interesting it's kind of like that
world's most expensive product the way
it's like setup together with a
concealer and the lid and I think it is
a good idea just the overall formula of
the product it didn't work out for me I
rave about Stila all the time and love
their eye products and actually love
their bronzer so I liked their face
products too but this one was just a
flop for me next let's just talk about
all three of these together at the same
time this is my lipstick queen I
reviewed these on my channel and these
are color changing makeup and I did like
a video talking about it and tried it
out honestly this was really fun for a
video idea but like just spending your
hard-earned money on it and using it on
the regular and this is not that product
honey baby doll because it's a gimmick
this really these just made my lips look
dirty they put a pink hue on your lips
but you can kind of see like this blue
and green sparkles in it and it just
makes it look there's some dirt on your
mouth and then the lipstick did change
colors but again it just has like this
still has a little bit of the green hue
to it so it just looks kind of gross
once you got it on your lips
this isn't cheap makeup either it's a
little bit more of a high-end realm so I
just don't think it's worth the money I
guess it was fun to play with for the
video but in reality and in the real
world no next from Too Faced the better
than sex
waterproof mascara so my bone to pick
with this I do like the original one but
this one I really didn't care for
because I found that it ran so it you
still get black residue on the lower eye
area from it like if you were to get it
wet but at the same time it's impossible
to get off even with a greasy makeup
remover I had it on for two or three
days just scrubbing my eyes trying to
get it off so it's like it bleeds but
then it
on and it needs a little I don't know if
I want to waterproof mascara this just
ain't the one it just ain't the one next
up from Al May I tried this out this is
a highlighter duo now if you like a
super soft subtle highlight you actually
might like this product but I personally
like a little bit more of a pretty glow
see I'm wearing a soft and subtle one
today but this didn't give me enough of
a pretty glow and this is just the duo
highlighter the liquidy side was way too
liquidy the stick side was the side that
had a little bit more of a pal to it so
overall it's just not a good product
from me it just doesn't have that
bling-bling claims doughnut kind of
moment next up this powder from Sephora
I bought this at Sephora and I'm always
liking to try new powders because that's
one of my most asked questions what's a
good sounding powder all the time so I
know a lot of good ones but I like to
try out different ones that way I can
give you guys options so I bought this
one the support brands always a little
bit less in cost in the store versus the
other high-end brands in Sephora so I
enjoy testing out support products
because a lot of them are really good
but this one mm-hmm go we were flashing
back for days this is just one of those
super white translucent powders I would
say this is almost a dupe though for the
makeup for everyone that's really
popular
they both flash back and I take a lot of
pictures with the flash now if you're
not taking pictures with the flash and
you just live in y'all and dam life
you ain't worried about the flash then
you might actually like this powder
because it does set the makeup well I
just find that it flashes back it's
super flashy and on snapchat when they
hit you with the flash and you flash
them right back with your eyes it ain't
good I'm another powder that I tried out
and it just flopped for me it was the
essence all about Matt this is the
compact little pressed powder basically
you're supposed to put this on your
shiny areas and it helps to mattify them
as most facial powders do the problem is
this product is way too white and it
leaves like a pure white residue on your
face it's not like a translucent
invisible powder like you get the
whiteness
your face if you try to pack this on or
try to dab so I really didn't like this
product it does work to keep you more
matte there's just it's just not
translucent enough girl next product
that didn't work out for me it was this
sweet peach glow which I think this is
like one of the visually prettiest
palettes to face has come out with the
problem is I don't know if they pressed
have too much of a binding agent in here
or if they compress the product too hard
trying to put the pretty stamp on it but
I can't get the product to come off I
can't get pigment out of this product I
have to take my brush into it and that
just about goes for all three colors now
I think it's the highlighter that comes
off a little bit more than the blush and
bronzer but really I couldn't tell a
difference and it looks like I haven't
used this and I'm used to several times
but even digging my brush into I just
can't get it to come off by a does smell
like peaches and it is really pretty to
sit on your vanity but to actually use
it it's kind of like next one of the
sloppiest mascaras of the year like I
really really really did not like this
mascara at all
this is the Rimmel shake it fresh toe
supposed to be clump free gunk free
mascara and you give it a shake
can you hear that well honey it's a
gimmick okay this is the watery mascara
it's one of those mascaras we're like
flings off your lashes little Oh mascara
will flicker everywhere because it's
kind of like I don't know it's so watery
and it did absolutely nothing for my
lashes as far as lengthening them and
filling them giving them volume it
didn't do any of that the products just
way too watery and like so maybe instead
of making it less lumpy they should make
it a little bumpier I don't know I don't
know but that was a flop and I I will
never go for that again an eyeshadow
that didn't work out for me that I
really wanted to work out for me was the
milk makeup this is their eye pigment so
it's like a cream eyeshadow but the
problem is whenever I put a nice amount
on my eye to get that pigment to really
come through I find that it cracked and
crusted all over the place and it wasn't
like a really pretty gorgeous green or
purple blue pigment it was just like
crusty cracky
whenever it dried and if you put such a
tiny amount so it won't do that you
don't get enough pigment and it's like
this faint green going across your eye
or faint color
of what the color is that you pick so I
just wish that the more that you put on
it wouldn't crack away or the less that
you put on how to more pigment if that
makes sense I don't know if I'm
confusing everybody but I hope that
makes sense
and why this product just flippity-flop
for me and eyeshadow palette that just
didn't work for me was the Sonia wrinkle
I'll probably saying that name wrong so
Touche you can come to she I don't even
know how to read the name but it's my
land coming honestly I didn't even
understand the function of the palette
because it was like these shades that
didn't have a lot of pigment they were
super sparkly and I'll have a pigment
and then under this metal part here was
like more shades I think I missed
something on this but I don't know I
just I didn't get what they're going at
I do love the packaging though of the
outside of the palette I think that's so
pretty and I like how small and nice and
compact it was but just the actual
quality of this eyeshadow in this
palette just it didn't work for me and I
do like the colors I think the colors
are really pretty I just wish the
quality was a little less dusty a little
less powdery and a little more creamy
and I also don't understand the little
metal lift up thing but that might just
be me two highlighters that did not work
for you girls are lovely is the cover
facts highlighters this is sunlight and
moonlight I thought these were gonna be
really pretty but honestly these are
just super powdery highlighters versus
really glowy
they kind of remind me more of a facial
powder instead of an actual highlight
like I don't know it's almost chalky I
want to say highlighters are supposed to
just have that wham-bam glow and these I
just felt kind of like we're more of a
white powdery situation so I didn't like
them on me and I felt like whenever you
looked at me dead on it just look I had
too much powder on my upper cheekbone
versus an actual highlight so those were
flippity-flop II for me however cover FX
makes cream highlights and I think their
cream ones are
nice but the stain alone powder
highlights were two eyeliners that
didn't work out from me was first the
NARS black valley eyeliner I bought this
and I opened it up and it was a little
dried up dot of eyeliner and it was just
hard as a brick I don't know if the
force told me a bad one or if this is
just how their eyeliner is however I've
been reluctant to purchase another
because it was just such a bad
experience and even trying to use the
little tiny dot that you got of eyeliner
in that big jar it's not a big jar as a
normal eyeliner jar it was dried so I
was like oh not doing that again
and next the ink caviar from Bobbi Brown
this just didn't work for me the
eyeliner again is the same problem it
was just way too dry and crusty like I
would never be able to create a sleek
winged liner with it so I just expect
gel liners to be enough where you can
dip your brush into it and kind of flick
and create a nice wing with it and
that's what I hope for out of eyeliners
and whenever I can't even come close to
doing that houston we have a problem
another product that didn't work out for
me was the Maybelline brow precise brow
pencil I remember this pencil having way
too much wax in it and not enough
pigment I mean it was pigmented but just
it was way too waxy you're getting more
wax than pigment and I couldn't get even
pigment going across my brow so I have a
lot to fill in like all of this is
filled in so I have to have like a lot
of brown pigment when it comes to a
product I'm not just you know
emphasizing all the hairs that I already
have I don't got a lot of heads so we
have to build a brow up and this just
isn't a good product to do that with
because honey baby there's too much wax
in the a concealer that didn't work out
for me is by morphe this is their
concealer sticks unfortunately this is a
newer product for them and just applying
it to the under eye area it's a little
too greasy and a little too heavy so I
did not care for this I do like their
cream concealers better than their stick
concealers and I did use this to carve
out my brows and the past he's an eye
primer and honestly it was okay for that
it was my favorite but it was okay for
that but as far as eye
the under eye and like instilling and
getting all that coverage this
absolutely did not work out for me so
I'm not gonna recommend it to you next
up this is the gimmick of the year I
believe
hello the Mack roller wheel liner girl
what on God's green earth are we all
thinking even trying this is this is
literally why we created the t-shirt the
gimmick because of things like this
it's a liner with a will on it and I get
the invention of it and I get trying to
be innovative but it's only innovative
if it works and they're like even tries
to work even remotely works this was
just silly to me like I can't even take
this serious ok that's what I'm gonna
say about this this is the only product
I'm not gonna be like well it might work
for you no don't don't waste your money
it's a gimmick and last but not least is
the Bobbi Brown nude drama palette very
pretty eyeshadow palette really pretty
color so you're like Laura what's wrong
with it well I mean I know I talked
about this before my worse
I should have palette video but the
colors are so chalky especially the
glittery shimmers their lights powder
everywhere so I don't recommend this to
you
my girl makeup isn't cheap and so save
your money there's a lot of nude palette
towel and I feel like you would like
another one other than this especially
with the amount of glitter that comes
off a new drama love the packaging love
the shape combinations and this the
quality of the shades we're just not
there for me oh my goodness so that is
it with this video guys so many products
they just absolutely did not work out
for me
um I hope this video helps you if I
talked about a product that you love
don't get offended just understand we're
different people or different wrong
human we're not all the same and not
everything is gonna work for me like it
might work for you and that's why I try
to explain why it didn't work for me
versus just being like it don't work I
love you guys thank you so much for
being here watching subscribe to my
channel today become a largely but come
on the Harley okay well stop now
and I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
