and welcome to my channel today's video
is going to be as chatting a lot about
products that didn't work for me I don't
know why sometimes actually people are
scared to talk what products didn't work
for them I find it to be a great thing
because not everything is all peachy and
sometimes make it just doesn't work and
it doesn't mean the brand sucks and
doesn't make the whole collection sucks
it doesn't mean it'll suck for everybody
it just means it didn't work for me and
I still like we should all talk about it
like if it doesn't work say it didn't
work so I have actually a lot of product
to talk about I have a bad bin now which
is inspired from talkie and I used to
have like makeup didn't work for me all
it was placed but now I have a look at
exact made it and then it's right behind
this little curtain thing and every time
something doesn't work out for me in a
video or I test out I'm just not feeling
it I put it in the bin and we can talk
about it in a dedicated video like this
one today also if I'm looking a little
bit less dramatic today is because I'm
rocking my natural lashes who is she I
don't know who I am anymore I've lost my
identity I'm not wearing false lashes oh
oh
mmm pre-fill mode actually right now
because I'm going on a vacation with my
best friend's in the world and I can't
wait oh my god I'm Calvin Calvin
freaking days anyways without further
ado my armpits are sticking together
because I'm hot but without further ado
do let's go ahead and jump right into
the video but uh-uh girl we got to
rewind it because we have to sing this
song to my channel and kummel arleigh
today now let's go ahead and jump right
into this video why doe um these
earrings aren't heavy everyone wear big
earrings that's like huge thing in the
comment section they're not having their
really comfortable I swear they are I'm
not lying to you first
hello I really wanted to love you so
much but it just didn't work out for me
these are the Bobbi Brown highlighting
powders now sunkissed glow and actually
a few of them and I'm not going to get
rid of them because I still just want
them to work for me Bobbi Brown did send
these to me I played with them and
they're just
so light and natural and whenever I look
at it I'm like wow
wham bam look at that glory and beauty
and then I went in with it quite dusty
too but I went in with it and I'm going
to town going to town and if you can see
that is also below that you get so
subtle this is the type of highlight I
like just being dead-ass like this is
what I like and this is doesn't even
come close to it so they also have this
one and again I'll flip the brush over
to the other side it's just not that
creamy filling either which is okay I
like some dry highlights you can see the
brush it's like loaded up go into town
go into town go into town and then this
is the result so it's not my cup of tea
they're just so natural and that's okay
if you actually love a natural highlight
you might adore these they didn't work
out for me I'm not here for it and I'm a
fine check it why let's move right along
the next product that did not work out
for me is a primer this is by
Dermalogica so I've been coming with a
lot of cool new things and I do
appreciate that however this one just
didn't work for me I actually tested
this out the first time doing manis
makeup and also girl know and then I
gave it another try and I was just like
it's not here for me it's very thick
filling and very I don't know as long as
pore minimizing it does make the skin
feel so incredibly smooth or matte but
it still feels so heavy on the skin like
the primer itself does it feel like
weight it just feels like I've put on an
extra coat of makeup before I put on my
makeup so it's too heavy for me it's too
much makeup I like a light filling
primer that's almost like my skin
absorbs it or you know it just rubs
right in and it doesn't feel too heavy
but this product was just a little bit
too thick for me and it smells so miss
Ollie and strong I didn't really care
for that and that is mine that didn't
work out for me but it does blur the
skin really really well but the other
thing so conscious outweigh the pros for
it let's not stop the party there this
is an old
product that I bought a long time ago
and I hung on to it and now I'm like why
don't you keep hanging on to a
girlfriend just let it go because I
tried it out again the other day and I
realized I don't like it I don't know
why stuff in my drawer so we're gonna
talk about it I don't know if you guys
know about the group wink the brand
Inglot there's somewhat a pro brand and
I like a lot of their stuff especially
there I should have pigments for their
high definition luminizing loose powder
is not a hit for me it's the yellow
banana shade that I have and I was like
yes matte powder you know rub it in rub
it and rub it in and it asks so much
shine it almost looks like a highlight
so just like setting the face in the
under eye with this I was like girl let
me actually try on this hand where I
don't have a highlighter just rubbing it
in as so much shame to it and shine it
will flash back on you and not only that
it just emphasizes wrinkles creases
sparkle glitter under the under eye
texture so all around luminizing setting
powder a bust for me I don't recommend
while we're talking about powder I'll
just go ahead and tell you why I didn't
like this one I bought this one recently
from Sephora it is the beauty amplifier
I've been trying to play a little bit
more with Sephora brand products because
I don't know a lot about their products
and they don't really seem to advertise
that much about their product so I've
been dabbling with it and this didn't
work out for me I thought it was going
to be kind of like alarm RCA or
toothpaste situation it wasn't that at
all because it flashes back to the holy
gods in heaven oh if you have oily skin
and you are going to be taking pictures
of the flash you might like this but my
skin is only in some areas dry in some
areas so it doesn't work for me and I
always take pictures with a flash
because I'm an influencer and girlfriend
we are always flash in that camera so
this is like my worst nightmare and it
didn't work out for me so I'm not going
to recommend it to you guys next up is a
concealer and I don't have the lighter
shades in it because I already got rid
of them but this is the Oprah sculpting
concealer and I remembered loving this
product oddly enough and I used it not
too long ago and the product just it
actually blends out pretty nice but the
lighter shades didn't have enough
coverage god only knows what I did with
it and not only
I found it to get a little bit crazy
throughout the day not the worst
concealer in the world I don't hate it
but they're definitely not my favorite
and I don't ever tend to grab them so I
figure it's time to let go talk around
the video and we'll move on with our
life and a better concealer the next
product I want to talk about I feel like
I've mentioned before probably in a
disappointment their products I regret
buying a product I don't like video
there's multiple titles for these videos
is the milk makeup cream I chose as the
eye pigment and I got really excited
about these because they are so
pigmented but whenever I planned it to
my eyelid girl we were chipping away
more than a bag of chips what it was
crusting and it was falling on top of
all of my lashes it looked a hot mess
and we're very well so I gave it a
second try and whenever I gave it a
second try a wart just a little bit
better still not my favorite product in
the world but I will tell you it wore
better because I use so much less
product like just a dab and then I like
would smoke it out like that you don't
get quite as much pigment whenever you
use less product it's more like that
than like this but I was trying to get
this much color but it really if you get
like a little bit of color out of these
not too too much that's when it doesn't
crease and it doesn't crack but now
whenever you're trying to get the max
color something like this grow by the
time it dries it's a hot app that i'ma
show you want to talk about yeah so I
still don't typically reach for them
they are doable and they are usable they
aren't the worst thing in the world for
sure but I just like loads of color and
whenever I try to do it it didn't work
next product we're going to talk about
is the blowing balm from the edge de
edit unfortunately the SI edit has RIPD
and is no longer with us Estee Lauder
kicked the brand to the curb and we
don't have the sa anymore so you might
be able to scoop up a few pieces if you
want at t.j.maxx I know myself some
pieces there this is a makeup bomb so it
is very BB cream ish and it has some
tint to it however me just wearing this
product out for long hours a little like
a greasy chicken chicken fry fry no
covers which is typically don't but
overall my appearance and not look that
pretty so I do recommend these to you
although you can
really problem anymore so why are we
talking about it I don't know I just
thought I would share it with you
because if you do get a chance to get
your hands on it
I would avoid that especially if you
have only skin these have such heavy
glow and moisturizers in it we both know
the outcome okay I don't feel like I
have to say we both know the outcome and
I look a hot mess so like I see this
products I'm like no no really or me no
next is a cover ah so I recently tried
this product out in a video and I hated
it I absolutely hated it and the other
own mascaras I would like the argan oil
in them I
what is that was--that's doing girl you
better calm actually don't like the rest
Garrard and because they're so watery I
have a lot of trouble getting my lashes
to stand up and be full I'm trying to
rock my show off today and this is a
shake one which I was excited about
because it's what's the you know cause
of volume and clump free I saw this
bushy one I thought it would give me
hope but honestly it works just like
their argument garre's it's not
identical
she's very watery and didn't do anything
at all for my lashes just made them look
a little bit blacker so I have really
been loving if you're looking for a joke
for mascara the volume is lash Paris by
covergirl oh she is not covergirl
L'Oreal and I'm wearing it today that's
what has my lashes standing up that one
beats this one by a mile so I don't
recommend that to you although it's fun
to shake but I don't recommend it to you
next up is from mac cosmetics this
product didn't work out for me this is
the big brow pencil so it's a big chunky
like brow crayon and I get how these
work if you have big beautiful brows and
you just need a little bit of tint added
or maybe a little bit of waxy to keep
them in place you can run this product
through your brow
however the freakin product ready girl
where's it at it's like invisible I
don't understand it like okay okay come
close fine well yeah it doesn't work it
doesn't show up it is nothing so I think
the drugstore has quite a few of these
but put off a little bit more
pigmentation and we'll do a little bit
more for filling in your brows which is
buffing in a little bit of
and wax whereas this one just seemed to
put like a touch a wax in the brow and
that's it so I don't recommend these to
you guys next for another concealer is
the amazing cosmetics hydrate concealer
if you have super dry under eyes I still
don't recommend it to you but that's
what this is for and the problem with
this is it had so much moisture in it
and it's quite thick if you can see like
daggum girl look at that but once you
blend it out you really don't get that
that much coverage in it and not only
that it creaked so I think it's because
it's so breezy and moisturizing it
creaked so hard down into every crease
in my being in Seoul that it emphasized
it and made it look so much worse so
this product was a huge bust for me I
keep it away from me I won't wear it
just grow the creases and not only that
I didn't even get that much coverage
from it because if you can see kind of
luminizing about the table you blended
out there really just isn't that much
coverage so next product I know I know
it's a lot is this brow dong dong min
brow one of the reasons in our cam in it
because I bought mine and it came broken
so I don't think I properly got the
chance to try it but also I feel like
there's just way too much pigmentation
where's the Mac one doesn't have enough
this one has too much can we just get a
happy medium let me be real I feel like
it's a really cool product in theory
it's supposed to have like a sponge on
the end to kind of carve out the brow
and then to run the bristle through I
really think it's a cool product in
theory however I think it's too goopy to
actually be a brow product you get way
too much product so it looks like a
chunky mess and there's a way to make
pigmentation yes it is what you think it
is is a gimmick that t-shirt is coming
very soon all right next up cover up
Eric so in my favourites and
disappointment I talked about this
highlighter from cover FX that I don't
like with toast girl is more powder very
powdery and less luminosity and I kind
of look for very creamy products with a
lot of luminosity with my highlighters
and so they have the highlighter palette
and I dug these out and actually I adore
the cream puffs it is so creamy and
pigmented but then you get down to the
bottom two powder ones and they feel way
even more drier than the single
highlighters I don't
dry and it's less pigmentation so these
are a bit of a buzz these are absolutely
amazing so half the palace good how bout
button and let me swatch and show you
see that that's one swipe and it just is
blowing well and glowing boiling just
one swipe of shade number two however I
will tell you shade 1 &amp;amp; 2 pretty much
look identical so I know once the sweet
golden ones pink oh by the time you get
on your cheeks I can't tell the
difference of the shade but these were
just very sad to me again just powdery
just a powdery situation without much
luminosity so honestly just spending
your money on this I would just go buy
if you want to have cream highlight a
separate cream highlight and a separate
highlighter because here's how it really
didn't work out for me
now I saved the best for last I think in
this video because this is the most
controversial thing that makeup industry
has seen in a hot minute and baby
sometimes eye makeup industry it just
need some drama and autumn Saji over the
hills they came in hot with some hot
drama with a subculture palette oh my
lord baby Jesus in heaven the internet
is a mad about this I've never seen more
girl fights on the Internet in my life
people defending the palette people
agreeing it sucks jesus lord have mercy
i think we all just need to come to our
senses if you love it vibe if you don't
know as for me and controlling trying to
use it this is the outcome of the
palette yes they put on their website
only tap the colors once or twice the
biggest problem with it besides the
fallout which to me that is the biggest
problem is the fact that they don't
blend if you watch my video I was
watching this footage editing it and I
couldn't really see you see more
whenever you play back your footage from
the camera versus you know while you're
filming look in the mirror like when you
play back you see things that you didn't
see before and every time I would blink
my crease right there we have no I
shadow in it and I had tons of the blue
color in it and not only that I try to
barely tap into this blue color with all
over my hands and it's all inside of my
legs my desk everywhere I was pissed so
then I saw our blending it on my eye it
got really packed you it's hard to blend
and it took over the whole entire eye
look the palette is too frustrating for
me to work with and guys I have been
working with eyeshadows and makeup for
years I have been frustrated with makeup
but this pissed me off I was like oh my
god
my makeup look I hate everything this is
so bad did I try to play with it a
little more yes I did because it's so
controversial I was like girl let me
just try to love it I can't love this
palette I don't love this palette I'm
not going to pretend to love this
palette just to make people in the
internet happy I don't recommend the
palette to use eyes I think it's a bus I
think there's Irsay there other palettes
have just as much fallout they do not
have this much fallout they have fallout
not this much girl this fella is a mess
literally figuratively
all around the board the path of bus but
again if you love it buy it if you don't
don't if you got it and you're enjoying
it and enjoy it and don't feel bad about
that whatsoever
I personally don't and I'm not going to
feel bad about it either there's just a
lot of makeup coming out and if you want
to make out already and I just think
there's too many options for to sell it
so that's my opinion on it and - is so
that is it I simply come up a lot of
products but we just had to get the cat
out of the bag unless you guys know the
T on makeup and what is not working for
me I love you guys to death also I have
a big back school video coming to you
guys hot so hang tight for that I love
you guys thank you so much being here be
sure and follow me on Instagram and
snapchat to keep up with my daily life
