video is going to be this makeup
tutorial here and I use said Jaclyn hill
palette from morphe brushes and I know
this palette is sold out so if you have
don't have it don't worry your pretty
little mine I'd the colors that are used
are very common color so you can
definitely recreate this with what you
already have in your collection is a
great universal I look cannot wait for
you guys see the tutorial on it and then
I did two lip options because I didn't
nude and I was just like I really wanted
to do a bright color I've done so many
bright colors lately I want to change it
up so then I just added this melted pink
color on top I can't get it together I
don't know what lip color I really want
to do oops
yeah something so absolutely wonderful
great and fabulous about this video is
that's a collab video I'm collabing with

she is the realest of the real comment
down below let her know that Laura sent
you say what's up girl
yes I'm say hi for you guys to see both
of our tutorials oh my god anyways
that's all I got for you guys so if
you're ready to see this tutelary yeah
just keep watching
starting off this tutorial of course I
primed my skin using my Porefessional by
benefit I've really been loving this
primer lately just gonna apply it in
areas that need a little extra
flawlessness per usual then I'm gonna go
in and of course add some foundation I'm
gonna be using the matte poreless
foundation today and I'm gonna bust out
all over my skin with my f88 angled
kabuki brush from Sigma I said that like
a question because it couldn't remember
who's in f88 or not but it is the f88
I'm just gonna blend that out all over
my face then going in with the e-40
brush from Sigma I'm gonna take this
really warm tone color it reminds me of
peanut butter from a toothpaste and I'm
gonna blend this in the crease going in
small circular motions and apparently
really aggressive like I don't know why
I'm doing it so aggressive today but
anyways this is gonna be your transition
shade and help everything look nice warm
and toasty and it's going to help the
other colors to blend out really nicely
together then I'm gonna go in with this
brush from morphe it's like a flatter
blending brush and then take this peachy
pink color and I'm gonna blend it right
on top of that warm tone color like I
said you don't really have to have this
palette you can just play around with
eyeshadows that you already have and
just use some warm toned brown colors
but basically I'm just gonna take my
time and blend this out right on top of
that color as you can see can I give you
that gradient fill once diffused makes
everything look really soft so we're
just building up colors right now
then I'm going to wet this little flat
brush and go in with this pink champagne
color I'm going to pack this all over my
lid the colors deceiving in the palette
because it doesn't show up this color
and then once you put on your lid you're
like wow this is a super champagne light
color so yeah it surprised me first I'm
using it always winged my tutorials by
the way and just packing that all over
the lid alright so here's a random part
in this tutorial I noticed my undereyes
we're looking dry and I really wanted to
put something on them before I did my
concealer so I just added the puffs off
by benefit really quick because they
were really puffy and dry and crusty
looking and this just helps soothe all
that and I knew that if I did my
concealer in this video right on top of
it it just wouldn't turn out quite as
flawless as I want I would normally turn
the camera off
for this stuff but where's gonna roll
with it then I just took these two dark
brown colored ones a shimmering ones a
matte which is a really weird thing for
me to mix together but again I was just
winging it so I basically pack this
right on that outer corner of the eye
this is gonna make the eye look really
wide on that outer corner and I'm just
pushing it in and doing really really
small swiping motions and then I'm gonna
build it up and add little by little by
building it up you definitely don't want
to go in with your brush fully loaded of
a dark color because you'll end up with
a mess so then I go in with a clean e-40
brush from Sigma and I'm gonna soften
that up and diffuse out those colors so
basically you can see what I'm doing I'm
just packing on color then going in and
blending it out next I'm gonna take
these two light shimmery colors and I'm
gonna pop it onto the brow bone I feel
like adding a little bit of color to the
brow bone just helps tie everything
together it's also gonna give your brow
a little bit of a lift and by the way
this is just a super cheap elf brush I
was using then going in with my NYC
liquid liner I haven't used to stuff in
forever but don't worry guys I haven't
forgot about it I'm gonna wing it out
but as I say in every tutorial that I've
ever done if you don't like wing liner
or you're not comfortable wearing it
simply draw a black line across your
upper lash line ladies and gentlemen
this just gonna help define the eyes so
yeah and by the way I did this winged
liner and nice and fast notes you could
really see what I was doing then going
in with them maybelline concealer I
really like this concealer to just cover
up the dark areas and then I'm gonna go
in with stroke of light bare minerals
and I'm gonna highlight my face I
highlight my face with this one instead
of concealer because it's a much thinner
formula so it's not gonna create like
cake base and super thick makeup however
I am all about cake base so there's no
hate on that there I just was trying to
avoid it in tutorial then I'm gonna
blend it out as you can see oh my gosh
it blends out so friggin easy like look
boom it's blended out it's crazy so that
is the benefit of using this stroke of
light which is an under eye brightener
not a concealer then I'm going to set
everything with my Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder I found this
to be a real oh hi there Joe cheat I
find it to be just a really good setting
powder and it helps the concealer last
so then I'm gonna go in with a 16 hour
wear bronzer by Too Faced I want to do a
long wear bronzer because this is the
summertime makeup look in summertime
make it please this left off faster than
any other time of the year so basically
I'm gonna actually contour my face with
this just kind of chisel out those
cheekbones
and bring it around to the temple area
I'm also as usuals gonna run just a
little bit down my nose just to get some
structure to my nose and make everything
flow
then I'm going to go in with this
shimmery bronzer from toothpaste and add
it kind of on the cheek area where I
would put my blush and I'm gonna be
using a big old fat fluffy brush to do
so this is just gonna add a little bit
of a highlight and shimmer and glow yes
honey
glow then going in with this dmap blush
from color city color it's actually a
really affordable pretty blush and it
reminds me a lot of I think Melba my Mac
I may be mistaken but it's a total dupe
for a Mac blush and then I'm gonna blend
all that out with that big fluffy brush
next going in with this highlighter from
Laura Mercier I'm gonna pop this on to
the high points of my cheeks just to
give us a little extra glow I can never
stop with this below like I just can't
stop out and shimmer so if you don't
like it simply hate this part off
obviously then I'm going to finish up
our eyes I'm gonna go back in with that
super warm tone color that we use in the
very beginning and that you are you
brush blending back and forth and then
I'm going to take that highlight color
that we used and just pop this in the
inner corners to make our eyes pop
next I'm going to go in with a tiny
brush and I'm gonna use the darker color
and I pop this right along the lower
lash line and using the bombs mr. right
this nude color I'm going to open up the
eyes by filling in the waterline with
this new two color liner by the way I
found out Rimmel makes one and it's
really good too so okay then going in
with my ICO mascara and I do I'm just
gonna add a few coats of this we're
gonna y'all me one when I have those
false lashes but as I always say two of
my tutorials if you don't like false
lashes and you're just not up for those
just build up your mascara oh and by the
way my lash glue exploded in my face my
hair and all over my earrings so that
was cool then I'm gonna go in with lash
arete from mosquito I have a discount
code it's Laura it's Kido you'll get 10%
off I'm gonna pop these on these are a
medium drama lash not full drama not a
little drama isn't medium alright this
is where I look troubles begin so I go
in with nude I'm gonna go in with strip
down and then the add cap on D's Noble
and then I'm gonna add child about
hourglass and that is the perfect nude
but I felt like our eyes were nude and
my lips were nude we had too much nude
so then I ended up going in with the Too
Faced melted peony and add in it kind of
on top and then I was like it we're
still coming nude and then I ended up
doing the electric robot on a saucy
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick and then I
was like I just did a nude eye in a
coral lip about a month ago I can't
repeat so I had a lip dilemma anyways
that is it for this tutorial I hope you
