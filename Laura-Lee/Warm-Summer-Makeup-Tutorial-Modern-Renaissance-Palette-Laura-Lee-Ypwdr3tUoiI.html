video is going to be this warm
why is everything falling apart we
wanted to create something really warm
for summertime if I have a slight and I
am not wearing a new lip for the first
I'm relieved I'm done
today's look is going to be this warm
summertime makeup tutorial and I am not
wearing a nude lip for the first time in
a long long time can you believe it
and I am wearing contacts guess what my
I did not change colors these are not
real and I get a lot of comments about
like the contacts why are you wearing
them why would you do that they come out
so I still have my brown eyes I do like
my brown eyes I like them a lot but it
is so much fun just to change up your
look temporarily mm-hmm just clarifying
and I might have a slight Lisp in this
video it's because I have my bottom
Invisalign in not my top Invisalign I
normally take them both out because I
have a very bad list whenever I talk
with them in and it's a little
distracting while I'm doing like a video
but I'm getting better at it so now I'm
going to leave the bottom in for those
of you who didn't know I am in doing
Invisalign straighten out my chompers
wish me luck
be sure to subscribe to my channel
before you leave for more shenanigans
we're gonna jump right in we're gonna
get started alright let's do it alright
starting out this contact why does it
keep wandering here to a blink watch it
here I need to be lubricated okay this
way is can get I drop here I got it
starting out I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of tempura and this is just a
color that is going to help soften up my
eyeshadow base that I have down which
most of you know I do prime my eyes with
my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre Saboo
Girt is always everyday
next I'm going to go in with a little
bit of raw Sienna this is a pretty
caramel color
and I'm just going to buff it on the
outer corner and then I'm going to bring
it like
on up men around I'm just going to blend
that out this is an e 38 brush from
Sigma and this is just a Holy Grail
brush I uses in every tutorial you know
the drill you want to make sure like
everything looks super soft and just
blend away the next shade I'm going to
take is a burnt orange from this palette
this is just a little bit more of a
warmer color using the same brush and
put it in the exact same areas and just
build up color if you ever want to wipe
with the same like different colors in
the exact same area it's because it
builds up color gives you that nice soft
gradient fill instead of it being like a
block like a shimmer color matte color
you really want it to look soft and like
the colors are fading into each other
gradually next I'll move on to my e25
brush from sigma and i'm going to take
real girl really gar you know I don't
really know the name of this shade so
I'm going to take this orange a shade
right here on my brush and I'm just
going to pack it all over my lid that's
right people I'm just going to load up
this lid with this beautiful color
mm-hmm whatever its name may be I'm
99.9% sure people tell me in the
comments many times how to pronounce
this color notice I didn't go crazy with
the brush I wasn't like Walsh warmish
cuz then the color would be blown out
all over my eye I kept the color pretty
low keep your color low did submit for
your eyelid and let those other colors
that we blend it out stay a little bit
higher shabam it's looking good next to
deepen it up a little bit I'm going to
take a bit of red ochre which is this
pretty matte oh I hit myself in the face
is this pretty matte like crimson red
color it's quite beautiful and I'm
really going to focus it like on the
outer corner but keeping it low not
taking it up too high and I'm not going
to drag it all around really I said my
focus it on the outer corner which
that's where I started to focus it and I
got happy with it and I just started
dragging it all around guys this look
it's pretty easy I'm not a lot to you so
next we're gonna move on I got this Z
palette
and these six eyeshadows from Oprah it
came in my boxycharm this month for the
month of July the shadows are so pretty
I'm going to take a little bit of the
yellow shade which this is a pretty
unique I shadow shade I'm going to pop
that onto the brow bone just oh this is
an e 57 brush it's a nice small sized
brush to get that brow bone get it get
it get it get it and then I'm also going
to take a little bit of the metallic
shade I got out of my box out of my out
of this / palette I'm just going to pop
it right on top I'll link the boxycharm
in my description box so check it out
this is my eyeliner brush this is in eat
11 brush from Sigma Beauty it's an
awesome awesome eyeliner brush it's my
eye wandering again so now I'm going to
wing it out I'm gonna be using my Sigma
wicket gel liner I have a full liner
tutorial if you want to get like cry cry
and dep I'm not gonna do that on this
video because I'll be wrong I take like
10 years new my winged liner because I
can playing games alright you see how I
jacked up my winged liner real good
right there that ain't no thang chicken
wing cuz I'm going to show you how we
fix it around these parts they give a
little morphe makeup remover tissue I'm
going to aggressively wrap it around my
claw and then I'm going to oh oh oh
that's dried I'm good I'm going to swipe
it away
real nos like that we wanted to put on
some mascara this is the katie-cat
mascara with covergirl and very black
first time I've tried it out he's got a
real weird wand on it and I'm gonna hope
for the best
first impressions it was okay I mean
nothing to call home about I'm gonna
keep playing with it for those of you
who are still hanging with me we're
gonna move on to my face makeup the
first thing I'm going to use is a heck
of a blot I'm gonna try that again one
heck of a blot by soap &amp;amp; Glory this is a
facial primer and it's supposed to be
good for like pores and things like that
it counter minds me of the makeup
forever their facial primer that's good
for pores it feels really nice on the
skin next is foundation I'm going to be
using the hello flawless oxygen Wow
foundation it's both benefit and it is
sunshade page whenever I wasn't on
YouTube before my YouTube days I used to
buy this foundation and use it all the
time I don't know I just thought you
might want to know that this is the
morphe g36 brush that i'm going to be
applying it with the shade mmm looks
pretty good
maybe I don't apply a lot around my eyes
because you know I'm going to put all
that concealer and there's not really a
reason to put on that foundation under
there it is going to cause cakiness that
is a hardened pastor lesson I'm learning
makeup like oh you should take my
foundation all the way up and then have
my concealer on top and it doesn't help
you know avoid the cake I'm now going to
take a little bit of the Maybelline
better skin this is their face powder
and I'm just going to put a little bit
of that right on top to set my
foundation this is a sec segment mm-hmm
this is a Sigma F 23 brush that I'm
using right here I'm going to be going
in with the Maybelline master can still
foundation unsealer and this one is in
shade light ace uses all the time and I
kind of forgot about it so now my
use it today just cuz I'm going to be
using this g37 brush from morphe there's
like a fuzz get out of here and I'm
going to apply this all underneath my
eyes and all the sides of my nose right
there I'm going to be honest with you
this is the first time I've used these
morphe gunmetal brushes and they're
really nice
I don't I they were gifted to me and PR
so I don't have the direct price of them
I don't know if there are cheaper than
the elite collection but they feel very
similar to the elite collection if you
want to know what I'm doing here I'm
swiping back and forth the under eyes
and then I'm dabbing it out to make sure
there's no brush brush strokes and my
concealer and then it's going to take it
around my nose where I get red I'm not
going to take a little bit of my Laura
Mercier powder and I press it into the
concealer with a Beauty Blender just
getting it on the Beauty Blender like
that and I'm just going to press it like
walk it around my face so good I'm going
to take this g---forty brush and this
Stila this is shade medium stay all day
bronzer it's a big fat nice juicy
bronzer pad I'm going to get some on my
brush and just start with those
cheekbones and we're going to carve it
out until it looks similar to the
malfeasance the g---forty is a nice size
brush for doing the contour because it's
not too big so you can really get that
structured cheek without moving the
powder too far down I'm gonna add a
little bit to my nosey Posie I feel like
right about now we are finished with the
baking process so this is that f23 brush
from Sigma and I'm just going to swipe
away the excess powder that did not want
to hang in there I'm going to take the G
at 35 brush from morphe and I really
love this this is a more feet my eyes
everything more feet this is not
sponsored by fluffy I'm gonna take this
9b blush palette I've mentioned it in my
favorites for I'm just going to mix
