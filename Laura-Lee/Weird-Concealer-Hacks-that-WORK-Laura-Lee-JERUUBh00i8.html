used for so much more than just covering
dark circles yeah girl if you didn't and
just keep watching I'm going to show you
a whole bunch of cool concealer hacks
for our first concealer hack if you want
to wear a light color lippy your natural
lip color can show through so you can
use a concealer I'm using the Maybelline
better skin to cover your natural lip
color and then apply your nudish lippy
right on top of that and you will get
the actual color of the lipstick or
whatever lip product you're choosing to
use for concealer hack number two I'm
going to show you guys how to sharpen up
your lip line I'm going to apply a
little bit of the maybelline fitme
concealer and a synthetic brush I'm just
going to swipe it and clean up that lip
line this is especially good if you're
wearing a darker lip color and having a
little trouble keeping it in line and
just FYI if you guys didn't know
maybelline has the number one two and
three best-selling concealers on the
market right now I mean who doesn't love
a good Maybelline concealer her
concealer hack number three this is
probably my favorite one I'm going to be
taking the better skin concealer swipe a
little bit on the back of my hand and
take a very small synthetic brush I'm
going to sharpen up the winged liner
this helps sweeps away any eyeshadow on
the other side of your liner or if you
mess it up a little bit you can correct
your liner with this trick it is so
useful and honestly I do it every single
day for concealer hack number four I'm
going to show you guys how to make your
nose look straighter by applying the age
rewind concealer right on top of it and
by the way this is the number one
best-selling concealer on the market
it's not really a surprise to me though
so I love this stuff but I just apply it
straight down the center of my nose and
it highlights the nose and I just buff
it out with a pH lender
moving on to concealer hack number five
I like to use a concealer that is my
skin color I prefer the Maybelline fit
me because it's not so heavy and I clean
up the brow area I clean underneath and
above my brows it gets a really natural
fat to it and again I just use kind of a
pointy synthetic brush to do this and
then I just buff it out with my finger
and that way we have nice
and reconsider hack number six we
definitely couldn't leap
color-correcting out so I removed my
foundation from under my nose and as you
can see I deal with some serious redness
there so Green cancels out redness and
you just want to apply a little bit of
product a little goes a long way and I
buff it out with a Beauty Blender this
way we make sure it doesn't show through
our foundation and then I will simply
put some foundation or even a
brightening concealer right on top of
that and wallah it cancels out the
redness so color correction is so
awesome and it's another good use for
concealers
poor concealer hack number seven this
one's really cool because if you don't
have an eyeshadow primer on hand do not
worry you can use a little bit of your
concealer just pack it on your lid and
just use that as an eyeshadow primer
this is also a really cool trick because
it also covers up any redness or veins
on your eyelid that way it doesn't show
through on your eyeshadow I personally
like to use the Adri one for this
because it does a really great job in
coverage for concealer hack number eight
highlighting m2 contouring has taken
over my channel and Instagram so of
course this is a hack and I won't go too
in depth with it but I have a full
contouring and highlighting videos if
you want to check this out thank you

hacks be sure to subscribe before you
leave and I hope to see you all in my
next video bye guys
