today's video is a very exciting video
because today we're going to talk about
the new trend strobing what is strobing
you ask well I actually have the chance
to talk to a very good friend of mine
the Mack counter to go over strobing how
it's done what it is and basically it is
getting on your fullest fullest glow and
leaving out all contouring and all
bronzing so that's right girlfriends no
contouring no bronzing it sounds scary
but I actually think strumming is an
absolute beautiful way to show off your
skin and show off your look and get rid
of the structured hard look of contour
so you're definitely gonna have a
big-time glow when strumming and I'm
going to show you how to do it because I
was recently taught how to do it and I
am here to pay it forward and pass it
right on to you lovely people do I thank
contouring is leaving us it's not going
anywhere
but I do think this is a great new trend
in makeup and I know we're going to be
seeing it around a lot on where I can be
super super tricky and strobing it's
like the easiest thing or it's easy
peasy lemon squeezy
so I'm going to show you how to strobe
today and the products I'm going to be
using is champagne pop by Jacqueline
Hill this is her collaboration with
Becca cosmetics oh so beautiful also be
using a cream highlight I love this one
by Mac this just shell this is a
tried-and-true highlighter holy grail
for me and everybody needs in their life
because it's the bomb calm so let's get
started
I've already demoed a ssin and I've
added my concealer to highlight my face
in the normal areas but again I left off
all bronzers and all contouring
absolutely none of that is on my face
just Foundation and the regular
highlight for strobing today I'm going
to be using my Sigma f30 5 this is the
tapered highlight brush and it is pretty
amazing for highlight I'll also be using
little fan brush from elf cosmetics this
brush will run you a whopping three
dollars the only thing is it's always
sold out so what I learned when strobing
you're basically going to add the
highlight to the typical areas that you
highlight and that's it I'm going to dip
my fan brush in a little bit of
champagne pop I'm going to add it to the
high points of the cheeks you guys know
already that this is this is how we have
liked this is how we do
I'm also gonna go run it up the tip of
my nose this isn't you know mandatory
but I think it looks pretty I'm going to
grab a little bit more a shell and I'm
going to do to keep its bow you're also
supposed to do the chin area which is a
little bit scary because I don't
normally recommend highlighting you
should add a little bit of champagne pop
on top of the shell by Max I'm just
layering up highlighters next I'll dip
into a little bit of my champagne pop
right here and you're supposed to add to
the forehead and this is the most
scariest thing in the world because
you're not supposed to highlight your
forehead because it can make you look
like you can fry greasy chicken in your
forehead if you have oily skin my
forehead gets crazy but I'm going to do
it anyways I mean when we're strobing
why not right I feel like I went a
little hard and just gonna take a clean
brush and blend that out a little bit so
we'll grab a morphe 408 brush grab a
little bit of champagne pop or even a
shimmery eyeshadow that you have on hand
and I stayed the brow bone so I could
highlight it on camera because this is a
punch strobing
I'll grab a little bit more champagne
pop and I'm going to pop it in that
inner corner I love doing this you guys
know I do this in like every tutorial to
get that inner corner glow but it's a
part of strobing so we're definitely
going to be doing that today
and lastly back to that f-35 brush I'm
just gonna just a little bit right above
the brow bone on to the temple in real
and that's strobing one last step I do
anytime I do my makeup whether I'm
rubbing or not a friend at Mac was like
girl you better set it with that mac
fix+ spray because this enhances any how
that you have on your face you'll be
extra strobe II I could just spray that
on my face all day long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
