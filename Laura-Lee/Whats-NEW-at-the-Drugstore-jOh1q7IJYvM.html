video is going to be a what's new at the
drugstore I like to do these videos
every three or four months just to keep
up with what the drugstores coming out
when I mean there's just so much good
stuff though can I just say I feel like
the drugstore has truly like stepped up
their game lately when it comes out to
products like it's a whole new level at
the drugstore now I mean we're getting
highlighters we're gonna face primers
we're getting full coverage foundations
a man and we already have full coverage
foundations but we're getting really
good ones okay and I'm really excited to
share with you these products also
before you leave don't forget to
subscribe to my channel because if you
don't you might lose me out in the
youtube world and you'll be like what
was that crazy girl I was watching the
other day oh yeah I didn't subscribe so
I lost her something you may want to
lose me we're gonna jump right Hannah
get started let's do it jumping right in
this video I have to talk about the
Milani from foundation first what the
hell I ended up getting o 5 + o 7 I want
it like two shades that were very close
I don't know what happened in there this
foundation I have been asked more times
than any foundation have our charter yet
and what are my thoughts on it so I
would have let me try this out and
letting you guys know I got Oh 5 + o7 I
thought I got like oh seven oh six oh
five OH six I don't know what I was
doing in there guys so it feels very
creamy it doesn't feel too liquidy
it feels thick I'm sniffing stuff that
look at that coverage Wow
okay I can already tell that I think I'm
gonna like this I mean I don't know how
it's gonna wear and all that always
update you guys on things like this on
snapchat so if you follow me on my
social medias I always let you know like
my final thoughts and then like a napkin
formula first impressions like right out
of the tube feels nice feels like a
high-end foundation like not really thin
no days
Aulani may have done done it the next
item I got isn't really a new item from
the drugstore but is darn sure a new
item for me - a shave I made to try out
this is the niveus since the post shave
balm I believe nikkietutorials is
the one who discovered this as a great
facial primer and I really wasn't gonna
get it because I have a drawer full
facial primer so as I'm why would I buy
a men's shape bomb when I have some that
work really good but I've been asked
again by so many of you to try it out
and let me let you know my thoughts so I
thought I would pick it up it's like
seven or eight books
smells like men's cologne which I dig so
I'm gonna try this out it's not really a
new of the drugstore but we're cheating
a little next up that's something I'm
really excited about as well this is the
new Milani um the sister liquid lipstick
metallics
excuse me metallic lip creams if I'm not
mistaken I think they're supposed to be
kind of like a soft matte lip cream um
not necessarily liquid lipstick and I
think they're supposed to be like have a
metallic sheen let's find out the first
color I'm trying is matte about you
smells so good it smells like those lip
smackers from like junior high school
and you have like 80 of the lip smacker
rollerball or the chap sticks in your
purse I know I did I love this one it's
super honestly like I like metallics in
more of a neutral form than a bright
form like this because it reminds me of
the 80s gonna be a metallic I need it to
be like a super light color or like just
a very neutral color nothing popping
like this so I probably won't wear this
I bought it to like try out for you guys
hell mi try it we don't know what will
happen it's one that I got is automatic
touch and it is a very bright berry
shimmer color see this is the stuff that
reminds me of the 80s I probably won't
wear however the color that does remind
me the 80s mi actually tries chromatic
addict missing a thumbnail right now and
I know you've been staring at it the
whole video I'm not ratchet I just used
it to open stuff okay you gotta take
advantage of that missing now this is
the baby that I would use look at that
you can use that like as a lipstick
topper you could wear it on it oh you
could paint your face with it you know
whatever you want to with it and they
also like cupcakes like the lip smackers
I love this though I love it if you like
bright colors I'm not trying
change your opinion on bright shimmery
colors if you like it do you boo but if
you don't well then don't next new
product from the drugstore I got are by
covergirl this is their true blend and
this is their new facial primers and
they came out with ones for different
things which I think it's just
absolutely wonderful for whatever reason
this metallic packaging just drew me
right to it I love white chic packaging
we have oily skin we have dry skin and
we have combination skin oh my gosh they
all feel like a really light gel
moisturizer
they smell like nothing almost um okay I
don't know my cause the dry and all the
skin filthy is on exam I'm sure they
have an ingredient in it that's to help
with hydrating or help you know reduce
the full um and then the combination
skin actually felt the thickest um so I
don't even know what that means but it
did definitely be trying these out these
will be my primers at all used for the
next few weeks this product I picked up
this by L'Oreal this is the lip palette
lip nude oh - so they had this in two
different shades there I went opt it for
the more neutral one by the way today
I'm wearing manis lippy by Ofra and I
know they were talking about not coming
out with more but then I saw on his
snapchat they were talking about coming
out with them against they sold out so
bad I'm gonna need them to come out with
some more because everybody's a little
bit of this in their life hello
I'm gonna be very real talk with you
guys I don't want lipstick if it's in
the palate just don't do it comes with
five different shades in it and also
comes with a really nice little lip
brush surprise it's not a sponge
applicator like they'd like to put it
drugstore makeup that's nice that's a
good lip brush I'm gonna swatch it it
doesn't look like some cheap cakey
makeup it almost turns into like a gloss
and I'm diggin it looking at my monitor
over here I'm not vain I'm just trying
to make sure you can see what I see very
very nice
look at that pigmentation does it feel
thin cheap too watery too thick too
chunky it feels like a high-end house
ant biting my toe just pinched my
that's so scary it looks nice and that
color is really pretty let's watch the
darker color little bit of a chocolaty
color that's a very nice palette so I
like the lip palette oh there is a bad
day at the drugstore I went to two
different drugstores and I couldn't get
the wet and wild new highlighters have a
station in full effect way I did get
press-on lashes by ordeal which has
nothing to do with highlighters you're
supposed to be able to apply these
lashes and it just be self-adhesive so
that would make it really easy to apply
false lashes you just push into your
lash line and be bah boom there you go
I'm trying to open it while I talk so
it's a little distracting I now
literally love talking to you guys so
much like I feel like we're girlfriends
sitting in my bedroom together and we're
talking about makeup
I just wish like it was kinda like
periscope and I could just like see your
comments go inside be like yes but yes
though yes you know something like that
I'm sana plastic applicator and you're
supposed to like set it like don't touch
the rim of it cuz it's got glue of it
and set it and kind of press it in your
eye without touching any of the I add
adhesive to mention these lashes look
gorgeous these are demi whispies so
they're very natural and light they have
a thin band so they're gonna be easy to
apply I'm actually gonna go ahead and
put the lid back on them so I can wear
them out one day umm how cool is that so
self-adhesive lashes from El de el del
are bell pepper all came out with these
little lip balms these are oh sure and
again
covergirl the packaging got me lighter
one is cupcake and the darker one is
candy they had three of these but I only
got two Oh someone's watched mine
already
oh so disgusting did you there's no
testers
I get it okay this one has them in
swatch and this is the one I was most
excited about this is number one cupcake
they don't smell that great in my
opinion um and they're extremely sheer
you know they remind me a little bit of
the benefit the Bennett ents so with
their calls oh I just want to put this
on my dry cracky lips right now actually
they're not cracking I'm going to be
wearing the crap out of this one this
one has been tampered with so
these are the katie-cat how cute
katie-cat mats
this one's called stink sinks and this
one's called Cotulla tricot graffiti
that's just too much we're calling this
one cat or that little cat ears on the
ends of the tube it's a really cute
white tube and then it says Katie Hart
CoverGirl's apparently they collab they
are very pigmented they are not matte so
they have a little bit of color I swear
to god someone just swatch this one and
it pisses me off why me I love this
color
okay here they are this one's been
infested with someone else's lips but
I'm dealing with it very pretty colors
very pigmented and has a little bit of a
sheen to it except is another lip
product I know I went crazy but we all
love lip products I know you do watching
I know you do so these are by Milani
these are the moisture locks um and so
they have grapefruit ol MP use lip
treatment so I guess it's just like a
little hydrating treatment for your lips
I picked up three of them they have
quite a bit of them there Oh guys these
feel nice this little applicator is
really big and it's weird it's actually
a really nice thick all for your lips um
and they smell nice too last but not
least is this Revlon mascara they're
coming out what just happened Revlon has
been coming out with a lot of mascaras
and I want to show a like review some of
em cuz I haven't gotten a mascara view
in a long time this one has a really
nice big full one on it and that's why I
got this one I really think I'm going to
love it this one is the ultra volume who
doesn't want volume in their watches but
we'll see what this mascara can do for
me I'm really excited about it it
suppose to be volumizing and I really
like the looks at the want on it though
I don't know mostly that's it for this
video I hope it gave you a little
insight on what's new at the drugstore I
will be continuing to charli's products
I'll let you know what I like in my
favourites and in my makeup tutorials
