video is going to be a what's new at the
drugstore video I ran by also beauty and
played in their drugstore section and
I'm going to be sharing with you a lot
of goodies that I found that are new to
me I filmed them and I hadn't seen it
before so I think they're pretty new and
I'm really excited to share those with
you and I want submit to you guys about
stars so that September with uLTA Beauty
guys the uLTA Beauty invited me to go to
the iHeartRadio Music Festival and in
Vegas it was in Las Vegas and was so
much fun it was really cool also was a
sponsor for the festival so whenever you
went to the day festival they had a
humongous tent with air conditioning
which is a huge thing and they had a
bronzer highlight station they had a lip
station that were giving out water that
we've given out makeup they were giving
out little mirrors and bags it was so
freaking cute in there if you follow me
on snapchat you saw the details and the
inside scoop so it was a very very very
nice booth and I thought it was so cool
watching the girls you know get free
makeup and get really excited and
getting their makeup done at the beauty
station and getting a chance to cool off
there as well and they had it really
pretty outside and that was really cool
to go to so thank you so much ultimate e
and then that night I went to the
concert and saw so many famous people
perform they also gave me the
opportunity to meet Cage the elephants
which is such an amazing ban in their
performance was just mind-blowing
there's so much energy and greatness in
it I saw Florida Georgia line as ariana
grande performed a Akash I saw so many
people I saw the Backstreet Boys is
whole brand new Spears well it was crazy
but it was so good
Thank You Alta for having me that was an
amazing opportunity and I never even
been to a really big concert like that
ever before in my life that's my first
time so I just had the greatest time and
looking back I'm like
so we're going to jump right into the
video and I'm going to share with you
the goodies up an and if you want to
trap subscribe subscribe subscribe to
our Channel and I'll say bet it
right but I try to make it rhyme didn't
rhyme so I'm gonna stop now
let's get started the first thing I want
to try out these are two having trouble
speaking these are two miracle mini
eraser sponges so it has one tool 6 uses
blend erase buff sweep lots of stuff so
I want to try this out cuz they're new
sponges from Real Techniques and this
one says the same thing miracle
sculpting sponge one tool 6 uses I'm
excited to try these out I want to see
how they feel like how dense they are me
personally I like my sponges to be
really soft so these are really soft and
bouncy they're about as soft and bouncy
as a beauty blender so whenever I get it
wet maybe I'll test this out and one of
my upcoming makeup tutorials I'll see if
it works
has anyone tried this does it work next
what I got from the drugstore is a new
mascara this one is by L'Oreal Paris
this is called volume is a feline did I
buy it because I like cats I did but it
looked really cool it's a new product I
got it in black of course and it looks
like the brush is really quick early
pepero Brickley
i wish you guys could see the mess that
i make after filming a video
Hey alright let's see what she looks
like she looks she looks good why do I
feel like it looks a lot like the
Maybelline push-up drama okay so they
are different the push-up drama bristles
are a little bit more they're bigger
these are a little bit more fine I wish
I didn't have on mascara right now so I
could try it out can't wait to try this
out I personally kind of like it
whenever the bristles are plastic and
not like the hairy ones so I'll be
trying this out what else
goody bag I bought these these are not a
new product in the beauty industry but I
love using these to cut my cuticles and
these ones look good okay next from
Maybelline I picked up the brow precise
fiber volume this is supposed to give my
eyebrows volume let's try it on now
I got shade soft Brown I must punch
myself in the face did you guys see that
wash that looks so weird I kind of don't
want to put it on my eyebrow like it
looks weird it's like nothing is on the
back side of the brush and the front
side has these little claws but you can
see little hairs or fibers coming out of
the product I'm scared just gonna mess
up my eyebrows
all right nothing Crazy's happening well
I got it my hair I actually don't mind
it I think the little fibers are
supposed to cling on to your natural
eyebrow hairs and like build up and make
it look like you have more eyebrows than
you actually have
ain't mad about that and it kind of
feels like a gel so maybe like dries
like a gel as well next I picked up the
Loyola pallet dip
we saw the L'Oreal headquarters whenever
I was in Paris and I was just like so
cold oh oh it comes with a brush okay so
I got the nude one because I love nude
lips and then it comes with like this
little synthetic brush which actually
looks very nice I really want to try
this color do you guys like individual
lipsticks or do you like like a lip
palette like whenever you're going to
put on the lippy like what would you go
to so these are actually really nice and
pigmented it seems that's the nude one
seems very pretty and they have a gloss
finish so it's definitely not a matte
finish they're actually quite glossy ah
but they feel really nice and creamy and
they have a nice consistent pigmented
texture to them and it looks like it has
a highlighter shade also if maybe you
wanted to put that on your Cupid's bow
or like the center of your lip to give
it a little extra shimmer Sean
next from NYX I picked up two products
that I've never owned from NYX and so I
think these are a new product they were
like out on like the shelves in the
middle of the aisle or whatever like
which is normally where they put like
newer stuff I think I don't work at Ulta
so I don't know exactly so I might just
be making that up
oh I hate good plastic wrap so these say
bright idea illuminating stick okay I
thought this was a contour stick so I
bought it in dark brown I think this is
supposed to be a highlighter this is
like a contour stick let's see I don't
see that much shimmer and then do you
guys see a lot of shimmer in that I
think I can use this as a contour stick
it says lumen a ting stick though bright
idea this one is in topaz tan number 12
so I'm actually going to try this out to
contour it could be like the worst Phil
ever but it could also work out so we'll
see what happens but this one is Sunkist
crush I also bought and this one would
definitely be more of an illuminator
it's like a rose gold color it's really
pretty
some looks like a bronze more than a
rose gold I don't know why I said rose
gold we'll see what happens but I think
these are newer products from NYX they
feel really soft and creamy like they
might blend out well most of NYX contour
stuff is pretty soft and creamy alright
next I picked up a product from makeup
revolution this is called aqua sil
liquid eye primer and sealant so you can
wear it underneath your eyeshadow to
prime and intensify and to make it last
all day I've never seen a shadow primer
really like in a dropper like this so oh
that's so weird it's like a liquid but
it supposed to be a primer we're going
to test it out on my hand to see if it
works and yeah I don't know okay so
there's a dot of it oh this is weird
some you just it feels like grease it
definitely is very grazie guys I don't
know though who has the greasy texture
on it I feel like would make your
eyeshadow priest
so I'm just going to take a powder
product no I do not work what am I doing
wrong I'm doing something wrong try
another powder product okay so that
worked better this product is pigmented
in general I mean I guess I've brought
out some pigment but I just feel like
with your eyelids because they have
natural creases and already wouldn't a
liquid eye primer like this cause it to
crease really bad and like to move
around and slough rather than to stick
this might be a little bit gimmicky
trying it on my hands I might really
scare to put it on my face because what
if I had like a really bad I shadow day
from using it or it could be like the
best thing ever
I don't know again if any of you guys
have tried this aqua sill at home
comment down below let me know formal
song next new from the drugstore these
are L'Oreal's
new eyeshadow quads this one is in 102
and this one's like a pinky and brown
color it looks very pretty
I'm always on the look for new drugstore
eye shadows because sometimes I just
feel like the drugstore that's not that
its strongest part you know for like a
better words and these feel very nice as
you can see the swatches look nice the
matte swatches aren't exactly consistent
I did have to go over it twice to get
like a good consistent swatch but the
shimmers were really great and then next
I picked up a blue one because you know
Halloween tutorials are coming up this
is number 112 and this this looks so
pretty so alright so I just watched the
blue and as you can see the matte colors
I didn't go over the dark blue twice so
you can see it's a little inconsistent
so you might have to layer it up on your
eyelid to really get that pigment to
show up but as far as the shimmery
shades awesome and you already know how
I feel about these little sponge
applicators get out of here okay and
lastly I picked up the brow drama crayon
pomade from Maybelline now I know this
is a newer product for Maybelline it's
not the newest product in the world from
the drugstore but I've never tried it
out I don't believe and so
this one is in I think this one's in
darker brown or whatever it doesn't say
acceptor away the packaging I just threw
the packaging on the crop my only
problem this looks like a really great
idea because it's like a brow pencil but
yet a pomade so it's a little bit of an
all-in-one type of product and you know
what I like about it I really like that
the product isn't crazy pigmented
because no one wants to do like a little
feathering notion and then their brow be
like boom with pigment you know you want
a softly filling your brow so you have a
little bit of a more natural look to it
so that is what I like about these my
only wish is that the crayon wasn't so
fat so you can get a little bit more
precise with your brows first impression
is trying it out swatching it applying
it to my brows a little bit it seems
like a really nice product I plan on
playing with it more I just don't see me
I like to like really define my eyebrows
especially underneath and I don't see
myself being able to do that with this
product so that would be my only
downfall but if you don't like really
define your brows you just give them a
little bit of color and fill them in
this product will be for you that is it
for today's video thank you guys so much
