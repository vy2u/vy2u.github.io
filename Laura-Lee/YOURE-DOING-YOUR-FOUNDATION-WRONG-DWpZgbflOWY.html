video is going to be a super different
and I'm really excited to create this
video because I want to help you guys
out with foundation I get so many tweets
and messages and Instagram questions on
what to do to fix certain foundation
problems that's going wrong with your
foundation routine such as long
causation isn't sticking to the nose how
I can stop my skin from getting so Olli
how to apply thick foundation how to
iron oh this is so many questions that I
get so let's make a dedicated video to
fixing foundation products and how
you're wearing your foundation wrong and
I hope you guys are excited about this
video I was trying to think for a long
time like how can I incorporate all
these products in one video and I was
like there just make a video
fixing foundation errors are like what
you're doing wrong your foundation and
we can see if we can fix it in this
video because like my little braids
today it's like mostly extensions but uh
you know it's just feeling like
twitching up my hair a little bit so I
did this little snazzy braids
anyways I don't have any makeup on in
this intro obviously we're going to
where we work out our price today also
before you leave this video be sure to
subscribe this meeting right now that
song cracks me up and I sing it every
time it still cracks me up I don't know
what anyways we're going to go ahead and
jump right into the video
shall we get started first let's talk
about our skincare I think the best tip
and the best foundation is skincare and
you know make sure you wash your face if
you have some serums and stuff that
you're putting on at night be sure
you're not waking up in the morning and
putting your makeup on top of those
serums here give me your face another
little rinse and you're moisturizing
properly whether you have olia or dry
skin I always recommend a gel
moisturizer over a ole based moisturizer
especially if you have only skin because
gel is only water-based and creams are
normally old base and you don't want to
be packing on the on top of oil and you
have a really heavy face that you're
starting with a fine gel moisturizer
especially if you just can't think of a
new position especially if you just use
them in the morning if I met your skin
just like drinks that moisturizer up and
it's just not fluffing and all over your
face where so they should can apply a
little weirder and even so I'm going to
go ahead and start with the pixie h2o
skin drink it looks like this and it is
a really lightweight gel moisturizer so
you can apply this to dry areas that I
normally just apply it all over I'd only
just apply it all over because that my
skin is a bit dry all over it's not too
dry it's being pretty normal right now
but it's normally pretty dry especially
in the winter time so next tip is
priming and I find that this is the area
where some people can potentially go
really wrong because you can just grab a
primer that your favorite youtuber the
reason you saw somewhere you think it's
cool new product and you just apply it
to your skin not all products work for
every person and primers are definitely
made differently if you have normal to
oily skin I would try a primer Lexie
mineral primer it's all free the veil
mineral primer I should say from
hourglasses all three if you have more
dry skin on tried the number 28 primer
from hourglass this one is a little bit
more hydrating and it's anti-aging just
to show you the two this one is the
number 28 and the one below it is the
veil primer so today I'm going to be
using the number 28 to get some moisture
into the skin you really don't have to
apply a primer all over your whole
entire face it's a lot of makeup and you
can just end up with too much products
on your face
and with a cakier fill when you don't
necessarily have to have that so just
make sure you're only adding a little
bit like a pea-sized amount of primer
maybe in problematic areas like such as
on your nose and your fore zone or zone
your t-zone and just places like that
that can really help eliminate using too
much product on your face and getting
that cakey feel or your foundations like
sloughing off because of that just make
sure you're not using too much prawn
product especially with primers in
you're only applying the right primer in
the right place all right next up we're
finally at applying the foundation and
foundations are a little tricky to apply
and I find that some things can go wrong
I want to touch on really quickly they
look right before we put on the
foundation if you were having major
problems should I get this tweet and
question all the time
how to keep the foundation on the nose
it could be the primer you're putting on
your nose and we've several reasons one
the foundation is not sticking to your
nose but as a little tip or trick to
keep it on there is to take a small
amount of a creamy concealer and you can
apply the creamy concealer just to the
tip of the nose where the foundation
isn't sticking and it's a little bit
more aggressive and will adhere to the
nose kind of like that and you can even
drag it around the nose if it's coming
off make sure you're not a nose touch
her because I subconsciously have
touched my nose and past like all day
constantly I'm like why's my foundation
coming off of my nose and then I would
catch myself doing it I'm like because
I'm liking it all but I know sometimes
the skin on the nose is Oly or you know
could be another number of reasons it's
not necessarily you doing it but this is
just a little tip or trick that can kind
of adhere that foundation on the nose
and just make sure you don't touch your
nose don't touch you so today I'm going
to be using with my favorite foundations
that ever existed I've talked about this
on my channel 9 million times you guys
are probably I dropped it so you already
know I love it um this is the hourglass
vanish foundation I'm in shade of beige
and I have been using this product since
it came out it comes in a hot triangular
shape to be able to apply to the
contours of the face this foundation is
so good and technically is a concealer
and foundation in one so it's eye
I have a problem with this foundation
coming off the nose so if you're really
having that issue you want to try
foundation that will help you with that
try the vanish foundation it really
would help the foundation to adhere to
the nose without applying a concealer
dome first if you don't have this
foundation on hand you can try this tip
and it might help you out but anyways
this foundation is just genius
altogether it's lightweight it kind of
feels like a powder on the skin because
it's so lightweight it definitely
doesn't look like a powder on the skin
though because it's so total coverage
but also blends out as easy as a liquid
so it's like an INT very interesting
product I've never found a do for it
I've never found a foundation anything
like it it is one of my ride-or-die
products that I just can't live without
and I've been using the shade of beige I
definitely have the options there to
find your shade it's O
long wearing and when the main things I
love about it it doesn't get in my smile
lines oh it's so hard to find a good
foundation that is full coverage and
won't crease up all in the small lines
this doesn't do that and only that I
always travel with it I'm out to show
you this is a fresher one but I'm going
to show you the one I travel with my
travel bag my travel bags right here and
pull it out whoever is in here I always
shovel this because it doesn't break and
it's small look how much she's been
through hell so I'm going to show you
how I like to apply it first I would
recommend you go in with a little bit
less product and then start to blend out
and then you can go back in whenever
you're done if you see areas that need a
little more coverage you can go back in
and fill those in they also have the
algaas spanish brush which is made to
use with the foundation and I will have
a link to this brush down below in my
description box so you can use a Beauty
Blender or makeup brush with it if you
stipple the Beauty Blender you can build
it up as you can see the product is
moving so easy on my skin you can build
it up stippling the Beauty Blender to a
little bit more full coverage and as you
can see it's the foundation is extremely
pigmented has so much color in it so
pretty that it covers so well and it
brings so much color to your skin I
personally have made the mistake several
times and this is
I find area where people go wrong with
their foundations they applied too much
foundation and this is an area or larlie
goes wrong with our foundation she
applies too much foundation and then I'm
in here working it in four hours or I
just have too much in that fund digging
in my smile lines because I put too much
on and it's trying to find a place to go
I normally use a brush with this today I
wanted to show you how to use a beauty
blender with it and just show you how
far a little bit can go and how long the
stick can last you if you don't use it
like a crazy person like I do sometimes
and like sometimes I just draw all over
my face and I whoa girl she uses a lot
of pickup with a Beauty Blender and just
a little bit of product and a full
coverage foundation the close-up shot on
here so you guys can see the real the
real teeth what I'm looking like so now
what I typically would do is I would
look in the mirror and say is there any
areas that can use a little more love a
little more coverage maybe you didn't
conceal the under eye with this I
normally only the concealer because I
like my under eye to be a little
brighter than my actual face but I'm
going to go ahead and show you that you
can conceal just dot a little bit the
under eye as well I don't recommend
blending at this particular foundation
out with your fingers I find that that
you could potentially do a little better
job with with a more liquidy foundation
if you want to use your fingers
absolutely fine and just as long as your
hands are clean also a little tip and
trick that I used to miss I'll take a
little bit of foundation and I'll just
split it around the neck area do you
hear me hit my neck and it's making me
down Locklear I hope this tips helped
you out with the nose and with the full
coverage beat so now let's talk about
setting your foundation
I personally foundation like this I
don't have to set my whole entire face
it's a lot of makeup I will set the
areas where I put concealer and I will
definitely go in and I'll go ahead and
show you and set the areas where I have
small lines just to have that extra
layer protection today I'm going to be
using the cover-up X this is the perfect
setting powder and shade translucent
light and I just get a little bit in my
lid and on a dry Beauty Blender it can
be damp it doesn't matter I normally
will take it and just press
right on into that small lines girl
ain't playing me not slimy and then the
nose is it's giving you issues make sure
and you set that nose real good real
good I take a morphe 45 brush i'ma add a
little bit of concealer and what I found
lately is less is more with concealer
you can move a little bit of product a
long way so if I want to do the whole
triangle highlight under the eyes I
don't have to fill in my own to our eye
area with a concealer I can actually
just apply a little to the under eye and
start to stipple it down into a triangle
motion and that way you don't end up
with too much product because I'm
telling you less is more
the creasing starts out whenever there's
just way too much product in the under
eye and I find this in makeup maybe
sorts of separate or get really weird
through here throughout the day when
there's just too much concealer going on
so try using a little bit less concealer
if you're having issues with that
because you could just be applying
honestly too much product because we see
on Instagram and I've done it before
where we just fill the whole area in
with just a chunk of concealer and then
we spend forever trying to blend that
out and then it just doesn't wear long
because it's too much product on the
skin so just try to add some to the
under eye and then start to stipple the
product out in the triangular motion so
you're still getting that highlighted
effect but it's just not too heavy of
makeup and then I'll take what's left on
my brush and just start stippling on the
chin if I want that extra highlight and
do you see I'm like very highlighted
through here but yeah I didn't just go
all over my face with concealer so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
powder on my sponge and a little tip
that you can do is you can lift up your
eye look upward and you're going to want
to start applying the powder back and
forth back and forth a tip wrong that
you could be doing is just applying it
one way out and you're causing the
powder not to get in all the little
creases of your under eye and it doesn't
set it very well so you just want to
work it back and then anywhere you've
concealed you can kind of set that
powder I was setting powder I find that
it is an area where it's a little bit of
a
double-edged sword because it's so great
but then it takes away all the natural
beautiful glow makeup so you guys if you
watch my channel regularly you've seen a
little tip that I share with you on how
to get that natural glow back this
setting powder takes away from you so
once your makeup is set i will dust away
the setting powder you can do it with a
brush today I'm just doing it with a
Beauty Blender I find that this game
looks flawless but doesn't it look a
little bit powdery and unnatural so what
I like to do now look do you already
know I'll take my Tasha dewy skin myth
I'll take my make it laughs and Milani
or my mac fix+ which I'll use today does
any setting spray that you're loving
I'll coat the whole face you can see
real good right now it's setting right
on top of the hairs on my face so you'll
take that sponge and you'll just pop
that setting spray in so don't forget to
do this step it's just like a little
trick I like to do and I'm about to get
all the luminosity back into my skin and
for the most part this is my foundation
now I would add you know the bronzer the
blush and the highlight and then the
eyes and the lips and all the rest of
the makeup but this is the coverage that
we focused on today and how I get a
write of this video is helpful to you
guys I hope you found some tips and
tricks in this video or areas that you
were going wrong but you can turn right
and doing your makeup and get that
flawless finish that you're looking for
I love you guys so much and I will see
you in my next video only did sing good
like the song would be more successful
but I will see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
