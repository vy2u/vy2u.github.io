video is going to be things that YouTube
force me twisted my arm behind my back
it made me by my lips tool extra tight
today can I say that like I feel like if
I smell there's gonna bust open its some
chapstick in your life
oh you two may be bad things yeah I
watch these tutorials I watched these
really awesome amazing people on YouTube
who do makeup tutorials I don't know who
all they are out there but they're
pretty amazing I've seen them do
tutorials and talk about products I'm
like I need that in my life it's like a
trance that goes over your brain you're
just like I have to buy that now so with
that being said I've bought a bunch of
stuff that you to maybe buy and we're
gonna go over it and I'm gonna tell you
if it was worth the hoot or if it was
baloney so that's what we're doing today
if you haven't subscribed to my channel
be sure to subscribe I would hate for
you to lose me out there in the YouTube
world so be sure and subscribe today
subscribe today
chicka chicka chicka chicka alright
we're done with that let's go ahead and
jump in the video and get started
starting out the first product is
actually if I'm talking like this it's
because my lips are still dry yeah
starting out is a product that YouTube
made me and my sister buy we're both
obsessed
I think Manny might be the one
responsible for this madness but this is
the Clinique take the day off cleansing
balm and I thought it was below me you
know end up buying it and I love it
so basically what I do is take a little
scoop of it and I actually have a lot of
fun using it I just like it out with my
fingers you can see it's kind of gross
it's got some eye makeup residue and
literally I take out my lashes and like
a full face to make it like this I just
it all over my face and have so much fun
destroying my makeup and it literally
melts your makeup off and then you want
to use a face wash and wash this off and
this is like the ultimate makeup remover
there has been a lot of replicas of this
made but and I have tried them out this
one is still my favorite one out of all
of them it's definitely worth the money
he's experimental it's all Abilio so
we're starting out on a good path so
let's move on what else did people make
me buy on the intern
huh I got one what the hell is this and
why is it in my hair a hands up being a
five-year-old so this is the cool and
you to maybe buy it it's supposed to be
like a diffuser where it causes the air
of your hairdryer to go out you can like
scrunch your hair if you have curly wavy
hair it's especially great for you I
tried it out and it works it does what
it says going to do and it's very unique
and cool on how it distributes the air
from the hairdryer here's the problem
with the gadget hey this piece is like
rubberized and basically it's so hard to
get on the hairdryer I had to get my
husband and put it on there for me see I
can't even get it off if I didn't want
to do this to my hair oh I'm gonna stop
now I'm gonna stop doing that I'm gonna
stop doing that
alright last one that was it I'm done
but I can't get it on and off it's
really hard and this isn't the actual
hair dry that I use on the regular
actually have one from t3 that I use the
Front's of those are a little bit
shorter like the nozzle doesn't come out
as long and this does not go on though
so it doesn't even work with those hair
dryers it only works with one that has
like this really long nozzle for this
piece to cook on my t31 it's just like a
little bit of a shorter nozzle and it
absolutely will not film that one so
it's not for universal hairdryer so you
got to make sure to work for your
hairdryer so that's a little blunder oh
that I have found with this gadget
next is the Giorgio marnie luminous silk
pretty sure I messed that up when I just
said it Giorgio Armani alum I'll sell
hmm
so this foundation has been I think
everybody on the Internet is obsession
for the longest time and I just don't
see what they're so obsessed about with
it it is a lightweight full coverage
foundation I just feel like there's a
lot of these foundations out there
that's lightweight and full coverage I'm
not like madly in love with it I don't
hate it I'll tell you that much it's a
good foundation it's it's very full
coverage very camera-ready but I think
it's a little bit much coverage for
everyday life and it's quite pricey to
think it's like $65 so you're going to
spin
a hot dollar on this and it's a good
foundation I'm not knocking the
foundation I just don't think it's worth
$65 and don't see the big hoopla about
it because like third drugstore
foundations that are just as strong well
good that costs a fraction of the cost
next foundation you two made me buy this
has been raved about a lot on YouTube so
I went and picked one up by the way I'm
in shade 38 deep beige this is the Marc
Jacobs remarkable
yep foundation now I'm not this product
before in a video that products it
didn't work for me since then I refuse
to give up on this foundation because I
paid a lot for it was I don't say this
one's about 50 um so I want to use it
you know cuz I spent my money on okay I
don't want to use it what does this
necklace keep creeping up on my neck
trying to choke me stop trying to check
my what the thing I didn't like about it
was the fact that it really really
really really got in my creases a little
small creases and it caused it to like I
don't know just really crease up it was
super annoying and also if you have
texture on your skin if you're dealing
with like bumps or anything like that
this enhances the texture in my opinion
so what I found to do to get the best
use out of this product is to use very
little product I was using too much
product and then I go ahead and add my
concealer my bronzer and all that so it
was necessary for me to use as much
product I was using I was just using too
much product so that really helped with
like the creasing um the texture on the
skin is still thing with this so it's
like a hit and miss if you have a smooth
skin um I think you might really like
this if you use a little bit of it I
think I was just using too much I'm
still not obsessed with it what I like
to do with it is with foundations that I
like a lot but they aren't full coverage
is add like 1 to 2 dots of this within
that foundation and mix it up and apply
it to my skin and looks beautiful and it
doesn't do the crazy thing so it's just
a way different way of using it and yeah
that's my method next thing the internet
made me buy and I bought this a long
time ago but I still got her this is the
AH massage about hill praying contour
kit this was quite raved about I believe
and I did a review about how much
like way back when it first came out I
bought it myself
and I liked it but I feel like the
colors are dry in it and it's very hard
to blend out if you ever see me use this
I add a drop of an oil to it there is a
lot of olds out there you know that are
made for beauty touch it makes one of my
favorites Camila oil and you can just
add a drop and it makes it so much more
wearable and blendable but with it on
its own I personally don't care for this
kit because it's just it's just dry like
it's like cake umm I thought she has
powder contour kit is one of the best
contour kits on our market firmly
believe that telling you a true story
but this one it's a little bit of a Miss
for me
I love honest hoshii I love the brand
but I have to add oil to this to get it
to work and the internet YouTube sold me
on it
the next product the internet sold me on
is the NARS audacious lipstick and these
are expensive I mean these are like 32
big ones
um sold on their own and I bought this
one at Sephora it's called Anna and I
freaking love it by the way I found out
in order to put your emblem on a
lipstick you had to use a silicone mold
versus a metal mold just food for
thought I mean there's nothing
interesting about that I just thought it
was cool um anyways yeah so they use a
silicone mold like this and I know that
and still call molds a lot more
expensive than metal molds do my
research people okay so yeah Anna my
favorite color I adore it I don't
actually have that that that much of it
less and I think these are absolutely
wonderful it is hard spend $32 on a
lipstick but if you do I truly think you
won't enjoy these lipsticks they're
phenomenal yes a brand that I haven't
used in a long time
but I got sold on the internet I used to
buy all the balm products they used to
be like really talked about I have heard
them talked about as much lately so I
would buy the palettes and then I
realized I never used the palettes that
I bought and it was because I realized I
don't really care for the palette I
tried my own I don't care for the brush
that comes in it that's just like a
little flute the actual eyeshadows
they're pigmented into a start blending
mouth and they blend out to nothing
I was really dissatisfied with this
palette and then all the matte shades
actually have like the sheen to them
almost so they have like a little bit of
shimmer and I'm still it's just
something I'm not up for I really did
not care for this palette this is the
the nude palette dude these used to be
really popular like everybody had these
palettes they have the meet matte
palette which is an all matte palette
that's a sick palette it's so good but
for some reason this one was just like a
fluke I hate it that's strong to say I
hate it but I really did not like the
shadows in these palettes and the air
Matt made me buy it that was dramatic
okay yeah another friend the internet
made me buy make don't you love how I'm
saying it made me buy convinced me to
buy is the atrium wine actually had my
subscribers recommended this to me on
YouTube they're like girl you need a
badass I bought it I love it I'm
obsessed I think it's one of the best
full coverage concealers you can get at
the drugstore is drawn with the price
this is not my shade I just grabbed this
one this is the bright luminizing
luminizing one like that's literally the
name of the shade luminizing I just used
the light medium one this is the shiz
next thing the internet made me buy was
this Chanel I feel so fancy when I hold
this up and I feel like people
immediately are like and too much but
this is fifty dollars expensive I get it
but it smells good
so that's old me no I'm kidding actually
I saw a lot of people on the internet
using this product and then I had a
makeup artist use it on me I just fell
in love with it immediately this is like
a cream bronzer but it blends out so
incredibly easy I wear this all the
freaking time like I probably wear this
at least three to four times a week like
I go to this I'm wearing it right now
it's just and melts into your skin it's
amazing I love it's worth fifty dollars
you get so much product I barely put a
little dent in the middle of it and I
continuously use it and the packaging is
huge so I love it the only thing that
sucks about it is they only have one
shade which is totally confusing and
crazy like how do you have one shade of
such a good product Chanel I know you
hear me create more shade
aids so it's everybody friendly you know
next thing the internet saw me on was
Inglot gel liner so I love this product
I adore it it's probably one of the best
gel liners that is for sale on our
market today I've gone through it's like
eight of these like literally I buy
these all the freakin time mostly
because I leave the lid off of them and
let them dry out because on my edge it
really good they're worth your money you
will adore this product and they work
best with a sigma e 11 or e 10 eyeliner
brush mark my word is the truth um there
is there's a live there's a little
kitten sleeping underneath me so sweet
last but not least what the internet
sold me on is this NARS um so every
summer they come out with the big Laguna
NARS bronzer Laguna which is something
that the internet sold me on when they
come out with a big form of it so latch
this is two years ago they came out with
one this year I wish would have bought
it for a backup because this is a really
great product and I mean that like I
literally bought me my mother-in-law one
of these I hope she used the hell up out
of hers cuz I know I used the hell up
out of mine it was so good
and I really really enjoyed this product
clearly the proof is in the pudding this
is an all around great bronzer and I try
new products all the time so it's hard
for me to say I use this everyday
because I'm constantly trying new
products so I don't necessarily use
anything every single day because part
of being the beauty bloggers just
constantly testing new things but I do
use this on the regular as you can see
it's just a go to trusted bronzer it
always looks good and I can always count
on her to get me bronzed up contoured
the whole works right here so that's it
for this video if you guys want me to
keep doing these maybe like a part to
keep rolling with it rolling women home
base well when I can do that let me know
I love you guys and
you have an absolutely amazing day to
die be sure I subscribe to my channel
for you leave and I will see you you and
your best friend that you're gonna tell
about my channel that's too much I'm
sorry that was too much I'll see you
