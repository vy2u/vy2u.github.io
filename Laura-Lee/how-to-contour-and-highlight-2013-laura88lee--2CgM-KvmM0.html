to show you the perfect and very easy
way to contour and highlight your face
right now all i have on it's just my
foundation which is troublin by
covergirl and it looks like this and the
color I use is four four five soft honey
they have on some mascara which is xx L
Pro by Maybelline and I have on some eye
shadow as well I've not concealed my
face yet but I will get started with
that I'm going to use the NYX HD
concealer and the color that I use is CW
0-4 beige so first things first I'm
going to conceal under my eyes which I'm
just going to apply a little bit like
this under each eye and then I'm going
to go ahead and conceal down the nose
and a little bit up here in between the
eyebrow area
and to rub that in I'm going to be using
a brush by Mac which is the 190 brush a
good dip for that it's just the regular
elf foundation brush that looks like
this
like that next I'm going to pin my hair
up because it is in my way terribly next
step is contouring what I'm going to use
for contouring is max one today for
sorry this one's fitting in and out and
it is really confusing my line so it's
going to use the color that is a matte
Brown chocolatey no shimmer no red
undertones to make sure that your look
is very natural some higher-end do to
this if you want to go really fancy and
have a nice fancy smancy contouring is
the NARAS duo with the Laguna over here
or you could go down to the lower end
which works just as well with my elf
cosmetics which I think this was $3 and
then um the brown and that is a really
good background to use the contouring
like I said I'm going to be using the
blonde pieman and to start off we're
going to start off along the cheekbone
line something
have trouble 550 Beaumont and a good
thing to do is use this is just a brush
and you just kind of roll it and you can
kind of feel that contoured line or you
can make a kissy face and kind of suck
in and you can really find out on easily
doing that so the brush I'm going to use
for that is my sonic a shoe and it looks
like this just a contour brush you can
use any brush and if you want to be more
detailed you could even use an eyeshadow
brush that looks kind of like that I'm
just going to get a little bit on my
brush and I'm going to start contouring
and working my way back to the hairline
you can even kind of make a kissy face
while you're doing this to make sure
you're staying on track with your
contour line
somehow I've contoured already and again
you can just use a thin brush get a
little bit of the powder on your brush
and you can bring it down further and
your face if you want it to do that and
um which creates an even more thinning
look
these are kind of harsh lines that we've
created on our face what I like to do is
take just a little powder brush
something like this this is just a
fluffy powder brush by Mac and it is
1:29 and I'm going to dip it in our
foundation powder pip forever and this
kind of work out any harsh lines that
you've created just so it looks a little
bit more natural right step okay next
we're going to be contouring the
forehead area the thing is whenever
you're come in a dark room you naturally
create a shadow that creates kind of um
just around the forehead area and comes
down the cheek so that's what we're
trying to create here and to do that
again I'm just using my blonde and then
this time I'm going to use the eye
shadow fluffy brush that looks like that
I'm gonna get a little bit on there and
I'm going to work it up and the thing is
what we're creating here is kind of like
a in cursive II um we're gonna go circle
circle so that's kind of what you're
trying to create on your face here
created a lot of harsh lines there and
again we're going to blend that out with
a little bit of our foundation powder
like so
just so we don't have any really harsh
lines and we want this to look very
natural so as you can see it kind of
looks like the light hits me around this
area and then that third thing we're
going to contour is right here down the
nose again it's easier to do the on the
nose if you're using the smaller brush
so I will be using the eye shadow brush
again and using blunt again and to
contour down the nose we're going to
want to do kind of with the brow starts
and come straight down the nose and kind
of curve it right here on both sides so
let's get started you really don't want
to use a lot of your um
powder here you want to do a really
light contouring here
and this really slenderized is the nose
mace to the nose look very straight and
very small and skinny
and there we have our news I'm going to
add a little bit more I have a little
bit more than usual so you guys can see
because the camera takes away so much
and there our nose is contoured and next
we're going to get our bigger brush out
that looks like this and we're going to
contour a little bit like a u around the
chin and then we're going to go along
the jawline right here and we're going
to contour here and then we're going to
come right straight down along sides
where you can see my neck which is just
a really creates a really slender and
look for the face um maybe if your face
is round shape and it also makes it look
really natural with the rest of your
face where you've already contoured I'm
going to get a little bit on my brush
and we're going to go ahead and do the
chin and then we're going to do the
jawline
and work it up into the hairline
now we're just gonna do the others
but again I'm going to go in with it
with my foundation powder because I
don't want it to look too harsh or
really anything unnatural and then I'm
going to go over my nose just a little
bit next is highlighting for
highlighting what I'm going to be using
is sephora's new highlighter they came
out with the lid looks like this and
it's called fresh face lemon icing
powder I dig deep for this it's going to
be your Maybelline and this is I don't
know what color this is because it did
oh it's champagne bloom and it looks
like this just a shimmery color I don't
know if you guys can see that and so
this is a really good dupe for that if
you want to use that instead I'm going
to be using just kind of a brush want
this this kind of smushed or you could
take like a regular brush and you could
smoosh it yourself and use it whatever
is easier so I'm going to get a little
bit on a brush and whenever you're
highlighting your face you're kind of
pushing out things that you want people
to notice whereas when we contoured we
took away things that maybe we don't
want people to notice that much so the
first thing we're going to highlight is
we're going to go right above the
cheekbone wherever we contoured so we're
going to go right about that and we can
even go under the eye and kind of create
a triangle
down the nose
like so
and then the next thing that we will
highlight is we're going to do kind of
the Sun ray sunshine right on the
forehead and then we'll go it again
we've already contoured around the
forehead so we'll leave that area along
a little bit on brush
the next day is a good trick to UM kind
of a pouty look I mean a pouty lip it's
a you can add a little bit of concealer
right above your lip instead of a
highlighter so that's what I'm going to
do and again I'm using the NYX HD
concealer and I'm just going to add just
a touch right above my lip like that and
instead of rubbing it in with a brush
I'm just going to rub it in with my
finger
which girl out you like to show up
around the lip area and kind of make it
my lip a more pouty look another area
you might want to highlight if you
haven't already done your eye shadow
colors is right underneath the brow ball
though so I'm going to get just a little
bit of my highlight color on my brush
the smaller eyeshadow brush I'm going to
apply that right underneath each brow
bone and you can even highlight under
your chin under your lip like this kind
of like a rainbow except that some
people like to skip when highlighting
and contouring their face is blush
because sometimes they have rosy cheeks
already but what you've done is you've
already covered all that with all your
foundation powders and contouring and
highlighting so I'm going to add a blush
and the blush I'm going to use today is
by Mac and it is called easy manner
all's it is is just a really light
colored blush I'm pinky colored blush
kind of looks like that don't know if
you can see it and a good dupe for this
is going to be the duo that comes in the
elf contouring palette it is the blush
color that comes in that so what I'm
going to be using to apply this blush is
just a going to be using to apply the
blush is a brush that looks like this
that is angled and this brush is 168 by
mac and to apply the brush I'm going to
do it right at the apples of my cheek
sometimes you have to kind of small to
UM find this and you're going to work in
a circular motion on back
you habit that is your easy contouring
and highlighting look with blush added
