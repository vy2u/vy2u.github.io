Lauren thanks so much for watching today
I'm going to be doing a first
impressions on a new brush from Real
Techniques I received this via octoly
and this is the multi tech collection
point L brush and this is supposed to
work a ton of different ways so it's one
universal cut and it says limitless ways
to play so I'm excited to try this out I
believe since this brush has a bit of a
point to it that's what makes it so
versatile so I'm going to take it out
the box we'll see what it's about my
package camera is pretty busted in the
mail it's all about what's inside right
so this is what it looks like it's very
pending there other brushes there's like
tape online oh it's not tape it's like
that plastic step over mirrors okay so
this is what the brush looks like very
interesting it's not very heavy it
definitely seems like you would hold it
in the middle here like that's right
naturally I'm going to hold it probably
SuperDuper soft and as you can see how
it kind of comes to a point there that's
that the point that's going to do
miracles for us so these are the ways
you can use it it says blush detailed
bronzing BB cream CC cream highlighter
contour and more so we're going to try
that out today I'm not using a BB or CC
cream though I'm going to use a real
foundation and just see how this does so
if it doesn't work we're not going to
count it off but I don't want to wear a
BB cream or a CC cream today so yeah
before we get into it with a brush
obviously I have a clean face here it's
washed moisturized and ready for primer
so for a primer today I'm going to be
using the hard candy sheer envy primer
and this is the shine free version I
wanted to go with something that I love
I know it's great I like the way it
feels on the skin and I know how it
works with the foundation I'm going to
use as well so that way there are less
variables this is such a great primer if
you haven't tried it out I highly
suggest it it just smooths out the skin
but I do find that it does help keep me
more matte throughout the day and it's
only six dollars like everything about
it to me is so great for today's
foundation I'm going to be using the
hourglass vanish stick foundation I love
this this isn't a color linen which is a
little bit dark and a little yellow for
me but I still wear it anyway because I
like it that much I don't know how this
is going to work with a brush yesterday
I used it with this brush from Eden
minerals and I was
kind of nervous that it wouldn't blend
out I was like I probably shouldn't even
do it I was so tempted not to and it
worked out amazing and this is very soft
and it's kind of like a medium density
which I feel like this brush has so I'm
hoping that this brush will work
I had long vacations and it worked I'm
hoping this one will too anyway I mostly
just want to use a foundation too
because I love it look so beautiful on
the skin you don't need a lot of it you
can build it up and have a ton of
coverage but even if you use a little
bit it has so much coverage and you
could use this as a concealer so good
anyways I'm going to just kind of put a
little bit of that around I like to
start off with not too much um that I
can build it up I don't know if it's
showing up like it looks so yellow in
real life I'm nervous I really hope that
this will work with it let's see what it
does and I'm just going in super lightly
I'm actually holding it higher than I
thought I would I think just so I can
put more pressure where I want it but
look at that like it's already blending
out that's crazy
I'm just going to blend out the rest of
my face and I'll come back on you know
was okay I wanted to stop and show you
guys this was basically one half a
little bit more blended out I think it
looks really good it's blended out
really nicely and something I really
like is that my brush isn't all gunked
up I feel like sometimes in use
something a bit more fluffy to blend out
your foundation it can just kind of gunk
the brush up but this looks like almost
exactly how was when I started which is
awesome I'm getting just nice coverage
nothing too amazing but I'm not getting
any patchiness
I'm not getting any like pickup of any
dry areas or anything looking really
good I do like it and I do think it's
working for this foundation which I was
not expecting I'm going to finish
blending this out I'm probably going to
add a little bit more coverage to
certain areas because I have a little
bit of redness and that
okay so that is it blended out on my
face I did go back and do just like a
little bit of a second layer in the
areas I need it
I found that if i took this brush and
kind of stiffled it instead of buffed it
it really kept the coverage in the area
that I wanted which is really nice but
it still blended out I think that that
pointed area is really nice for that I
do find this is a pretty big brush which
makes sense so that you can do multiple
things that like powder and bronzer and
blush and things so when I'm getting
around my nose area I find that I do
kind of like get up and almost pinch it
to make sure I can get into the crevices
of my nose and make sure that product is
blended out so that's just something
that I found I was doing to make sure
I've got a good blend other than that I
do really like it again super soft and I
love the way that my foundation blended
out I'm really happy that I was able to
blend out that six foundation with this
I don't know if you'd be able to do that
with every stick foundation probably not
honestly but I'm glad that would work
and like I mentioned before depending on
which foundation you went in with I
wonder how pumped up your brush would
get because the thing is you should use
this for multiple things and I love
thinking about like planing it between
each one but I feel like the whole point
of this is just to be easy and not
really have to mess around so I'm not
going to clean it between all of these
like I might do a little like small on
my hand or something but I kind of want
to test it out more realistically like
if you were getting ready in the morning
and wanted to use one brush or if you're
on set and we're using one brush on
someone how would that work so anyway
that's my foundation let's move on to
concealer it doesn't mention that you
can blend out concealer and honestly
this is so big I will really wouldn't
want to blend out concealer with it so
I'm going to go on with my Beauty
Blender and a concealer today I'm going
to be using the Milani retouch in a
racism in the color fair and I do really
enjoy this I don't like using the sponge
tip to actually blend it out I'm using
this as a way to almost highlight and
conceal at the same
okay so that's me with my concealer now
we're going to move on to powder which
we will be using the brush board I'm
going to be using combination of loose
powder and pressed powder for this so
for under my eyes I'm going to using the
Kat Von D translucent locket setting
powder this isn't necessarily my
favorite powder but I'm trying to use it
up so that's why we're using it I'm
going to just dip hopefully the pointed
area the most in the powder that's what
it looks like on the brush I'm going to
tap it off and I'm just going to try to
set under my eyes just quite a large
brush to be doing this lift I feel like
oh yeah I feel like it's too large for
underneath the eyes it doesn't say
specifically to set the under eye again
I'm kind of if you can see I'm kind of
like manipulating the brush just fit in
the area I wanted to I'm also going to
take this powder I'm going to set the
t-zone area of my face there's powder
all in there
so I don't think this is the best under
the eye but I do think it's going to be
nice for the space because I really like
the way it put the powder down I like
that it has that tapered edge too like
when I set it here I find that all the
bristles kind of can match up with the
skin of some extent so I do really like
that and just to lightly buff around the
rest of my face and when you're using
this Revlon nearly naked powder and this
is just so I can apply bronzer and blush
it's strange when this is kind of like a
in between density of being able to buff
but also being able to you know gently
sweep product on so I think that's good
and helps it to do multiple things I
have my powder done and I feel like it
applied the powder really nicely even
with me putting foundation on previously
before that so I think that's really
good it says blush detailed bronzing
highlighter contour okay so we're going
to go in and I'm going to use my butter
bronzer from Physicians Formula and I'm
going to be bronzing up my face I like
to use a bigger brush for bronzing and
contouring I have a bigger face and I
don't like something too too precise so
I already knew this would probably work
for me in that way and if you can tell
I'm just kind of like patting on the
product I'm not really sleeping I don't
know why I just naturally do that
alright so now I'm going in and putting
on the bronzer it's going on really
nicely feel like it doesn't like Pat
here
I'm not sure if you could get that much
of like a contour like your typical
beauty guru contour with this brush it
is just a little too large even with
that pointed edge I feel like you would
really have to manipulate the brush to
make that work and get something really
sharp but I guess if you really just
tapped in just the very tippy tip of it
because I guess you could I just think
it'd be easier to just use a separate
brush all right I love the way to
bronzer looks I'm going to move on for
blush today I'm going to be using the
color part a I'm going to use a color
party from Tarte and I'm just going to
use the tip of the brush again gently
swirl it and apply that to the back
apples of my cheeks and blend out
I don't know how I feel about it doesn't
look good guys I feel like it does but
then part of me is like I don't know
maybe I just applied it in a weird place
than normal for me they go usually have
it up higher like here and back here I
kind of like it though let me know what
you like how you guys think we're gonna
move on because I don't want to put any
more on to highlighter I'm going to be
using the Urban Decay eyeshadow in
illusion this is the one that I like
there's no way I'm not going to move my
brush to get a thing I just feel like
there's too much room for it to move so
far if you don't squeeze the Bradley
I mean I guess I am able to really just
get the nose this is not my favorite for
highlighting so that's my whole face
done with the brush I am surprised in a
lot of ways and there are some ones I
don't necessarily like love it I want
people to use it the five different five
different ways which I feel like is like
the biggest selling point on it I'm
going to go finish the rest of my makeup
do my eyes my brows my lips and then I
will come back and right now my final
thoughts all right so I am back I have
my eyes done my eyebrows on my lips done
if you guys want to know what I use it
is all in a demo that I did on the
look-see eyeshadow review so I will
leave that link down below if it's up
after my final thoughts on my first
impressions for this brush I do really
like this I think it's really nice it's
SuperDuper soft I think it's great
quality I definitely think you can use
this for multiple purposes so I do like
it for the foundation I love it for the
powder I also really like it for
bronzing blush is kind of nice I kind of
like the way it went on I definitely
want to test that one out a little bit
more personally I do not like it for
highlight I do not think it's precise
enough I'm not someone who likes a
really grand highlight and I definitely
don't want to put it in places I don't
want it so I feel like this is just a
little bit hard to do it does have the
pointed tip which makes it easier but
it's definitely to me just easier to use
a smaller more detailed brush to get
your nose get your cheekbones get your
Cupid's bow I definitely will be using
this for highlight like on my everyday
basis yeah I think that's what basically
it's a great quality brush I think that
it's a really nice one I'll definitely
be using it in my collection and I think
it's really good honestly I feel like
you can use brushes however you want so
I'm multi-purpose brushes all the time I
use brushes better for your face for
your eyes I use eye brushes for your
face like whatever it works for what I'm
trying to accomplish and it doesn't -
like this has multiple uses just a
highlight no highlight for you okay guys
that's everything thank you so much for
watching let me know if you're going to
pick that brush up down below or if
there are any brushes that you like that
have multiple uses that you just love
and use all the time I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
