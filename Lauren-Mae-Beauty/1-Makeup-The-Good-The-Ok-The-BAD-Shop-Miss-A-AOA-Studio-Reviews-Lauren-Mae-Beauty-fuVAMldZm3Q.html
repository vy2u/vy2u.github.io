Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be talking all about
one dollar makeup I'm someone who loves
affordable makeup and when I see
something that's a dollar I am skeptical
I'm like is it good is it bad what's it
gonna be so today I thought I would
share with you some reviews on dollar
makeup from shop masae they sent me
these products but this isn't a
sponsored video I have some things that
I really enjoyed I have some things that
are kind of in the middle depending on
your preferences you might like you
might not and then I have some things
that I didn't really enjoy so you know
even if we're spending a dollar I think
it's great to know what the winds are
and not waste any of your money on
things that just your subpar so let's
just get into it I'm going to start off
with the things that I like because I'm
the most excited about them what's so
great about these love's is that these
are things that I want to repurchase
these are things that I'm going to
continue using my collection after
testing these products out these have
made their way into my makeup loves and
I'm really excited about them so let's
get into those my number one favorite
thing that I think they sent me this is
the shop mist a it's the beveled Wonder
sponge
I believe this actually retails for a
dollar 55 and I believe the 55 cents is
an added price so that the proceeds can
go to helping animals I believe there's
like a whole donation thing with it so I
think that's an amazing thing a dollar
55 for a freaking sponge is an awesome
price and on top of that this is an
amazing sponge the shape of this is very
similar to the one from Real Techniques
this is soft and squishy and blends on
foundation beautifully it blends out
concealer beautifully
I do enjoy the shape of this and I
honestly have been using this ever since
I got it haven't touched my Beauty
Blender I just really love this it does
puff up with water I believe they're
sold out at the moment so hopefully
they'll come back into stock but this is
a super amazing sponge for the price the
best sponge at this price point that
I've ever tried and honestly it's not
even like it's good for a dollar 55 it's
just freaking good so highly highly
suggest this sponge it's amazing I love
it I'm going to purchase a ton of these
for my kid you just can't beat that
price and the fact that it works so well
and it's such a
high-quality sponge is great I've washed
this multiple times I haven't had any
ripping or tearing it is a light pink
color so I do find that it shows some
stains but if you are you know keeping
up with washing it I use the Beauty
Blender cleanser and that really does
get out so many of the stains and makes
it look pretty nice so highly suggest
very very good my all-time favorite
thing I got in a very close second this
is the AOA studio perfect setting powder
I love the setting powder so so much
this is the matte translucent and this
mattifies the skin without adding any
extra texture at all all it does is all
of a sudden you have this veil of like
matte on you but it still looks like
skin again there's absolutely no
detectable like texture at all on the
face so I absolutely love this I will
say this does not mattify for a very
long time I do find that with this
powder I get like about two to three
hours and then I do get shiny but
because this doesn't add any extra like
layers onto the skin I find that I can
kind of blot away the oil that's
breaking through and then reset with
this powder and my skin still looks
absolutely flawless absolutely amazing
so there is a bit of touching up with
this powder but I feel like the finish
is so worth it it's something I truly
truly love I love the way this looks
underneath the eye if you're looking for
a powder that isn't going to make the
under eye look more dry or just like
wrinkly and crepey this is an amazing
powder
I don't experience any flash back with
this but I also don't bake my face so I
just use a setting brush and set my
entire face pretty well but I don't use
an excess amount of powder and I just
love this I really really truly do just
you guys know you get 0.25 ounces or 7
grams of product in here and I know
that's not a lot but for a dollar it's
amazing I love how small this is it's
easy to travel with so I highly suggest
this product I've been enjoying it it's
the only loose powder I've been reaching
for I've been reaching for it over my
Becca one over my Maybelline one it's
just amazing the next item that made it
onto my love's list is a brow product
this is the AOA
well it's rubbed off so this is the AOA
brow gel I have mine in the shade taupe
and I
we really love this product it's very
similar to the benefit give me brow I
know there's one by essence it's one of
the really small spool ease that you can
add a little bit of tinted brow gel to
your brow hairs I really love a fluffy
brow look and this really helps me
achieve that again this is a dollar and
I I mean I just think it's amazing for
the price I love how small the spoolie
is the color on this for a taupe is a
little bit dark so if you're super fair
and don't want something that is going
to be too heavy I suggest using just
this and not really filling in your
brows too much just letting this kind of
coat the hair but I really like the
effect that this specifically gives
compared to my other brow gels because
of the fact that it's a little bit
darker my normal everyday brow routine
uses the colour-pop brow pencil the brow
boss one in blonde in the front portion
and then I use the elf instant brow lift
pencil in taupe in the last half and
because this is a little bit darker it
really defines each one of those hairs
and is a little bit more of like an edgy
look but it's still definitely wearable
it's a little bit of a stronger brow and
I just really have been enjoying it with
any type of spoolie I suggest like
scraping off any extra as well as
starting in the center of your brow
moving to your tail and then go in with
whatever products left in on your
spoolie in the front portion just so you
don't get to have you have a look at
that very front part you can always
build that up that's my like suggestion
with any type of spoolie brow thing but
overall I think this is a really amazing
product I believe it comes in three
shades and clear so when I order from
the website I think I'm gonna pick up
another one of these but also a clear
one just to see how it works I will say
in my experience this doesn't give a ton
of hold so as much as I can like brush
up and spoolie my brows if I do
something like let's say put a shirt on
after I've done my brows and it touches
my brows they do go down and then I have
to like kind of spoolie them back up so
that's something to keep in mind if
you're really looking for something
that's gonna hold I don't think this
will be the product for you but if
you're looking for something that
deposits color and give some definition
to the brows I think this is really
really nice highly suggested I've been
really really enjoying it and I've also
been getting like a ton more compliments
on my brow
and I believe it's usually when I wear
this product the last like makeup
product that I have to talk about that I
really really loved is something I was
the most skeptical about this is the aoa
studio perfect BB cream when i got me
sent to me i have it in the shade fair
and in the shade light I was just so
skeptical I was like these are gonna be
greasy and gross and just like look
horrible on the skin they're gonna make
the skin look so bad
I just I was very prejudiced against
them but these are absolutely amazing
products what I love about these the
most one they're a dollar so they're
really inexpensive but obviously besides
that because that's a huge theme of this
entire video these look so amazing on
the skin they look like translucent you
can't tell where this starts and it's
just your skin these are a pretty light
coverage I feel like you can build it up
to medium but they aren't gonna give you
like full coverage glam they're not
gonna cover all your imperfections I
find these really just even out the skin
tone they give you such a radiant do we
look to the skin without looking greasy
you
it just looks just stunning stunningly
beautiful I would expect this finish
with like a high-end dewy foundation or
something I highly suggest these if you
like that type of look I have
combination oily skin I get very oily in
the t-zone but I still like makeup that
kind of shows my skin a little bit more
so I'm okay with things kind of getting
oily a little bit more because I find I
can fix that easier than I can something
that's really matte and caked on to the
skin it's hard to kind of touch that up
throughout the day these on me lasts
about four --is-- hours it just depends
if I'm using this setting powder again
kind of like at the three hour mark I
like to block and reapply some powder
but I just think the finish of these is
totally worth it again for the price
highly suggest these I like applying
them with a sponge I mix the shade fair
and light to get a good match for me but
these are really really good again just
my skin just looks so so good I'm
wearing it today I'm wearing all the
products that I'm talking about that I
love today so yeah highly suggest these
if that is a type of finish you like if
you have dry skin these are awesome
and the last products on my love list
things that I just highly recommend are
the brushes I believe
they sent me the 24-piece brush set
which retails for $20 but you can buy a
lot of these brushes individually for $1
on the website I haven't tried every
single brush they sent me but every
single one that I have tried is amazing
quality again for the price I really
like the handle they're just
professional looking
this one's just like a pointed pencil
brush I really enjoy some of the ones
that are more like flat shader type of
brushes I just find that the quality of
these is really really nice for the
price that you're paying the only one I
really don't suggest is the fan brush
it's just a little flimsy it's not like
it's the worst it's just not my favorite
so you don't need that brush if you were
thinking about buying it individually I
would just go with the colour-pop one
this is one that retails for $8 so it's
a lot more money it's a lot softer it
also is just denser and I just enjoy it
more but for the brushes I really do
recommend if you're gonna buy them
individually I really love the f-14
which is an angled blush brush it's just
a really nice brush it's soft it's not
like overly soft but it's definitely
very very soft
it applies powder really well these are
a bit light but I'm not expecting
anything super heavy or luxurious for
the price the one that I'm probably the
most excited for this one is the
highlighting brush or the f19 brush it's
very similar I feel like to the honest
hacia one I've been using this a ton
ever since I got it and I highly
recommend it I've basically just been
using this one actually since I got it
so this one's really really awesome
again a dollar and then the other ones
that I do highly suggest from them are
any of these like flat shader brush --is
this is the e 122 and I really have been
enjoying these for packing on any
shimmers onto the lid I feel like there
are quite a few different variations of
this type of brush in the 24 piece kit
so I've really been enjoying how these
have been applying eyeshadow and just
you know I've been exploring more with
having a more metallic light or doing
cut creases they're just different
things like that so I have really been
enjoying them I love a good affordable
brush and these ones have really really
impressed me now let's move on to the
products that I think are ok these are
products that I think if you were
interested in them if they were really
catching your
engine they sounded like things you'd
really enjoy then you will like them but
for whatever reason they're not
necessarily like a part of my everyday
routine they're not something I would
use on a daily weekly basis and so yeah
let's get into those the first products
I want to talk about are the eyelashes
the only reason these aren't in my loves
is because honestly I haven't tried them
yet I'm not someone who wears eyelashes
but the reason I'm putting these in this
section instead of just not talking
about them or putting them in like I
don't recommend is because of the lash
band so I put these straight into my kit
and knew that these were something that
I would definitely want to try using on
people because of the lash band I
specifically really enjoy a clear lash
band so you can see all the knots of the
lashes tied to that band these are the
easiest for me to actually apply I feel
like these look the most realistic on
people without adding a ton of liner or
doing something really dramatic so I
just I really am excited to use these
and if these work out well I am going to
pick up more so this is the other one
they got me this one is like almost like
a double set so I think that for a
dollar trying out these lashes is
definitely worth the risk so if you were
ordering from the website and you do
wear lashes I don't think it would hurt
for you just to pick up a couple lashes
see how they work for you because it's
such a great price and I just love that
they have a clear band instead of
something that's opaque and just hard to
bend and to fit onto the eye so these
I'm really hopeful for and the other two
okay's are both lip products so they
sent over the diamond lip glosses and
these are something that I would have
really enjoyed and wanted to try just
looking at the website I love the
packaging on them they're really really
cute I feel like they've done a really
good job of like packaging this stuff
really nicely even though it is such a
good price so I have the shade glitz
which is the lighter like golden one and
I'll give you guys some swatches these
are a very glittery lip gloss and I
think that they're beautiful you can't
feel the glitter in the actual gloss on
your lips the only reason I'm putting
them in here is because I honestly just
haven't been reaching for them as much
as I would have like there's nothing
wrong with the quality of these I don't
find them to be like sticky or
or anything like that the other pink
shade is posh so if this is something
that was catching your eye on the
website I think you definitely could
enjoy these and could get some really
great looks with these I think they
especially work well to like add a
little bit of an accent
on the lips oh these are nice but they
aren't something that I have been
wearing all of the time are really been
reaching for it so that's why I put them
in the kind of like middle range if you
wanted these if they are your type of
style when it comes to makeup I think
you'd enjoy them but they aren't
something I'm getting a ton of use out
of currently in my collection and then
last kind of in that middle area where I
think these are good products but they
aren't just like absolute like loves
where I'm just raving about them these
are the AOA Studio Wonder matte liquid
lipsticks and kind of the basic reason
these are in here is just because I'm
not a liquid lipstick person so if you
are I think you would really enjoy these
formula wise I find that these are the
most similar to the Lime Crime velvetine
out of everything that I've tried
they're very opaque they're very thin
and more watery they're not like one of
those really moosie formulas they have a
ton of different color selections today
I am wearing the shade echo on my lips
and this is with technically two coats
built up but you could definitely get
away with one pigmentation wise they're
really great so I think that if this is
something that you really like you
definitely would probably like these I
don't find that they're like overly
drying for a liquid lipstick they dry
down completely matte completely
transfer proof and they don't really
feel like much on the lips just kind of
a drying sensation like most liquid
lipsticks the only kind of negative I
can see with these is that they do stain
so there's a swatch of echo so that's
just something to take into
consideration this is the shade bougie
right next to it it's like a really cool
toned nude the one next to it is the
shade extra so overall I think that if
these were what you were interested in
you will like them I know they're like
really good sellers on the website this
really pretty pink rose is called Roxy
it's really pretty this is like a
classic peachy neutral shade it's called
work it this is a pretty light nude
that's work it and then last I have the
red
and this is the shade obsessed and it's
really pretty I mean I think that
overall they're nice they're just not
something that's in my specific style
but I think if you love liquid lipsticks
the price on these you definitely should
try out a couple in colors you think you
would use and see how you like the
formula and I thought I would just show
you that's an example of some of the
staining I had with it only being on my
hand for like two seconds alright guys
so we are down to the products that I
don't recommend these are products that
I just didn't get on with I don't think
they're worth the dollar even I would go
with something else so let's get into
those the first products here are the
Wonder skin primers that they sent me
they sent me a mattifying primer as well
as the poreless primer and I just feel
like these don't do anything that they
claim to do at all whatsoever so when it
comes to the mattifying primer I was
expecting this to be similar to like the
Becca mattifying primer or the Too Faced
peach one that I'm using just something
that was going to yeah mattify the skin
this I honestly feel like does the exact
opposite this makes my skin feel tacky
it makes it look do we like it doesn't
do any of those things I don't find that
it controls my oil like I don't I don't
understand this product yeah it just
it's more moisturizing in a thicker way
than anything so I don't suggest this if
you're looking for something to mattify
if you're looking for something just to
kind of go on the skin before foundation
it's not like the worst I just don't
think that it mattifies I don't think
that's a correct claim and then the
other one the poreless primer this just
doesn't fill in pores it's a very thin
silicon clear primer I thought this was
going to be similar to like the baby
skin or something like that but this is
just so thin that it doesn't really fill
in any pores there's no yeah filling
action happening at all so I don't
really suggest this as well I would go
with something like the maybelline baby
skin I know the smashbox one is like way
different in price but i just prefer
that one that one has just more
structure to it so i do find that it
does fill and blur and kind of mattify
and so yeah these just were a bust I'm
gonna pass them on and then the other
two products that I didn't get along
with our brow
products the first one here is the
Wonder brow tinted brow pomade I have
mine in the shade taupe and honestly I
just I kind of found like this was very
similar to the covergirl one and the
issues that I had with it I I don't know
if it's just that I don't prefer a
pomade on my brows I need color I have a
lot of brow hair I just need actual
definition when it comes to color so you
can see them on my face and I just don't
like the way that this goes on I want
something that is a little bit less
creamy and oma silicone II has a little
bit more pigment that I can kind of be
more specific about so to me this just
wasn't worth it
I'm still like hopeful that I'll find a
brow pomade that I really like I really
want to try the Anastasio one again but
this one just definitely isn't worth it
to me and the other brow product is the
AOA a sculpting brow pencil now I will
say I love that this has a brow spoolie
on it I think this bully is really nice
and helpful so that's a great feature of
this pencil but overall I just didn't
like how this pencil worked I honestly
wasn't a huge fan of the color I don't
necessarily mind the shape of it it's
kind of a teardrop shape like the
Anastacio brow definer pencil and I've
used things like that before but I just
felt like this was a very like yellowy
blond taupe color it didn't necessarily
match the other topes in the line it
didn't match the brow gel that I've
talked about it doesn't even match the
brow pomade so I just thought that was
kind of weird this definitely takes out
my brow hairs it's just a harder pencil
to use and because it's a bit of a
fatter tip it just doesn't give me any
precision it's just not something that I
think is worth it i way prefer my ELF
instant brow lift pencil which is two
dollars instead of one but it's worth
that price and i also just prefer my
color pop one which again i understand
is more money but they're worth the
price increase to me over this pencil
and it's not something that I even want
to try to finish up alright guys so I
hope this review was helpful I hope it
can help you navigate the shop miss a
website and specifically their AOA
Studio brand I think it's great that
they've come out with their own
make up and their own affordable
products because that's what they're
known for their kind of like the online
dollar store some of them are really
really awesome and I truly truly love
them some of them are just like you know
save your dollar save up your dollars
and get something better let us know
down below if there's anything you've
tried from them that you really love or
that you really hate anything people
should stay away from so hopefully it
could help people who maybe want to shop
on the website and I think that's
everything thank you guys so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
