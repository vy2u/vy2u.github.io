Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk about some brands
that I saw on the Ulta website that I
feel like I haven't seen anywhere else
and by anywhere else I mean Sephora
these brands might be sold at other
places but I feel like the two big rival
like makeup big brands that sell other
makeup brands are Sephora and Ulta and
so I tend to always gravitate to a
Sephora for whatever reason I usually
get gift cards for them and I just I
don't know I'm just drawn to their sight
a little bit more to their branding a
little bit more than I am - Ulta so when
I was checking out the site there were
some brands I haven't seen on Sephora
and I thought I would talk about them
with you these all intrigued me and
since I had never heard of them I
thought maybe you guys hadn't either so
I would love to know if you've tried any
of these brands if some of these items
I'm talking about are good or bad like
should I steer clear don't get them are
they worth it are they not if you tried
any of them let us know in the comments
but other than that let's get into some
brands that are carried by Ulta that you
might not know about maybe hopefully
hopefully you don't know the first one I
feel like is one of the newest ones I've
heard like a few murmurings about this
but really nothing and this is beauty by
pop sugar this is a new brand by the
brand pop sugar which if you don't know
they do a lot of different like online
content they also have a subscription
box which is like the pop sugar
must-have box I actually used to get
that in Arizona I think it's like a 35
or so dollar a month bucks and you get
full-size items and they range from
beauty to lifestyle to all different
stuff it's kind of cool too a little
anecdote little story
I didn't pilot like a fox kind of like
pilot test show and we shot at the
PopSugar studio so their studio is like
super fun and cool it's like that like
millennial workplace that you just love
it had an amazing like food area they
had like kombucha on tap in there in
their studio so anyway they have a
makeup brand it's what I'm trying to get
to and the biggest thing for this like I
feel like the defining factor and the
thing that I was kind of the most taken
aback by is the fact that this stuff is
expensive so expensive the price range
is high-end it's up there with like
Tarte and Urban Decay and all of those
brands that's where the pricing
themselves just an introduction to a few
items and
have these eyes shadow palettes which
are in a very curious layout I guess we
could say they retail for $42 I believe
they have at least two different like
options of colors which is it's just so
expensive for a new brand I just don't I
don't see the price reflected in how
these items look like a few items look
like they could be expensive but the
other ones they just they look like Ulta
brand for me like they look like Ulta
brand items and so for them to be
charging these price tags it like
already turns me off anyway they have a
liquid metal eyeshadow so you know I was
interested that retails for $23 and then
something that I thought was also kind
of cool as they have a be cosmic crystal
lipgloss these are very similar to the
Sigma ones as well as I believe Jessie's
Girl had some of these as well but that
retails for $24 so you know that price
point man they're going for it that one
I think is just an interesting one it's
a new Beauty cosmetics like line out
there let us know in the comments if you
tried any of those and you think they're
worth it I don't know I just feel like
they're a little expensive but that is a
brand off at Ulta if you didn't know
moving on this is one that just gets me
I'm so excited I really want to try some
stuff this is fizz and bubble and they
are a bath and body brand so all their
stuff has to do with damn lip scrubs
which retail for six dollars they have
some amazing scent choices they have
like a watermelon have like a cherry
slushie they have a coconut pineapple
they have a mint mojito like just really
intriguing flavors they have some
backbones which also retail for six
dollars and then to kind of like cutesy
things they have cute little gift sets
ranging between $20 and $30 I feel like
these would be really nice like gifts to
people like if you're have like a nice
or something I don't know that's like
what I thought of immediately because
they have this cute unicorn one but
they're just like fun gift sets and I
feel like that's pretty affordable I
mean you know decently affordable and
then I feel like the most unique thing
that I saw online is they have a bath
milkshake or what they call a bath
milkshake and it's like it looks like a
milkshake but it has like multiple
things for your bath I don't know it
looks really cool and those retail for
$15 which is kind of pricey but
definitely intriguing so again I'm
I'm gonna say this at the end of every
one but let us know if you try this down
below what's worth it what's not the
next brand that I had never heard of
until I was like looking up some mint
items that I wanted to try out for my
mint video if you haven't seen that I'll
leave it linked but this is the brand
Grayskull now these are giving me some
like Loki molten brown vibes but this is
a way more affordable line if you guys
don't know Molton Brown is like this
pretty dang expensive bath and body
company I don't know they they sell like
shower gels and hand creams and hand
washes and lotions I used to sell them
at my old store and people went crazy
for this crap I don't know the vibe of
the packaging just the way it looks just
reminds me of that same aesthetic of
molten brown but everything in this
range retails for between $8 and $12 at
least what I saw on the website they
have like fragrance mists they have some
shower like gels and stuff they also
have hand cream so you know I'm already
so excited for me what really intrigues
me about this line is the scent
combination so they have a wild fig in
pink cedar scent which sounds amazing
that's the one I'm the most excited for
they also have a ginger Lily in Mandarin
and then they have a grapefruit lime and
mint they have a few other ones but
those are the ones that really caught my
attention the things that are like
really being like I want to try that if
you put 3 cents in in it like 3
different combinations of something like
wild fig red currant and like I don't
know toasted vanilla I'm down like 3
cents to me is just like well that is
complex but that is a brand I'm really
excited to maybe look into because I
think the price points really nice when
I compared to something like molten
brown the next period on my list is
tasks and this is a haircare brand the
reason I had found this brand on the
website was because I was looking at the
daily deals or weekly deals I'm not
really sure but this brand was on sale
and they had like a million different
dry shampoo options and if you have been
on my channel you know that I love dry
shampoo I love it so much I have fine
thin hair it gets greasy really fast I
try not to wash it as much as I can
because it's colored as well so yeah I
love dry shampoos and they have a ton of
different options and they're affordable
so they have a chia seed volumizing dry
shampoo super-interested they have a
coconut freakin dry shampoo you guys if
coconuts in the name I'm there for it
and they also have a charcoal clarifying
dry shampoo so all those sound just
really intriguing and these retail for
eight dollars
I believe when I was interested in them
they were like half off sort of like
three ninety nine or something insane
but I didn't order that I should have so
those are something that's really
intriguing me from the brand as well as
they have this kind of like wine theme
or something with their products so they
call it the unwind leave-in conditioner
they have two different ones of that and
those retail for nine dollars and then
they have these deep conditioner like
little packets again with the wine theme
like a rose a1 and some other one I
think like a red wine one and those
retail for four dollars so those just
for something like a little bit
different I thought it was like kind of
fun again it'd be nice for like a girls
night or like a little gift if you're
putting together like a care package or
something I thought they would be kind
of cool to put in there alright the next
brand is the one you've probably heard
about on here I have two that are like
maybe you've heard about them but this
is the brand Lottie London this is an
affordable makeup line that Ulta is
carrying I've heard of this brand
through Taylor from the Tayla she did I
think something with their stick
foundation so that's something I was
kind of interested in that retails for
nine dollars with their eyeshadow
palettes which are quite a big palette
for the drugstore and those retail for
$13 the packaging on this brand really
reminds me of Cokie as well as the price
point I feel like they're you know
pretty affordable drugstore brands
especially compared to other things like
Revlon and Neutrogena and all May and
all that and one more thing that kind of
was exciting this brand is a little bit
more like I guess edgy in a way like
they have some like jewels and like some
like face tattoo type things and I love
that type of stuff so they have some
adhesive jewels for like kind of like a
festival look I guess you could say that
retail for 550 which is awesome because
I know Turk is having some that are like
$12 so that's like half the price which
is awesome so I just thought I would
throw that out there in case you're
going to any festivals and you want to
get that adhesive you know jewel thing
there you go a little cheaper five more
brands were half way down the list the
next one is something that I've been
talking about a little bit on my channel
never tried it but like
no me I'm always like talking about
brands and products even if I don't own
them and this is the brand little barn
apothecary this is a skincare brand it's
vegan non-toxic cruelty-free and there's
just something about this brand I want
to try I don't know why I haven't heard
really anyone talk about it I don't know
if I'm just like missing out on what
people are talking about I haven't
watched as much YouTube as they used to
I feel like I've kind of cut back on
watching a ton of content but I really
haven't heard anyone talk about this and
if they have let me know because I'd
love to see their reviews but basically
the names of these products just sound
so great the aesthetic of this brand I
just AM into but it's just a little
pricey I wish it wasn't expensive but it
is just to give you some examples they
have a passion fruit and rose and
enzymatic ends Maddock I don't know
exfoliant mask and that retails for $50
so it's expensive stuff some of the
products that really got me is they have
a lot of coconut in their names once
again so they have a coconut and mint
cooling mineral missed and that retails
for 22 although they do have a smaller
travel size I think that's in the ten
dollar range they have a coconut ash and
earth deep cleansing mask mm-hmm that
sounds interesting
Lotus $50 and then the other item that
was really intriguing to me was the
coffee in mint scrub it's a body slowly
ATAR and that one seemed really great
but it's $30 so I don't know like again
obviously if you've tried any of these
things I'd love to know if you thought
they were worth it how the brand was
it's really awesome that they are vegan
and cruelty free and non toxic like
that's awesome the next brand on here is
a cosmetics line and this is note
cosmetics I've never heard of them
before they claim to be accessible
Beauty so I do believe they're you know
they are a bit more affordable but when
you think about affordable think about
like pixie affordable or like Sonia
Kashuk when they had makeup like yeah
it's not like high-end but like it's not
like definitely not wet well then Elif
like it's not that accessible so I would
call this drugstore ish just to give you
some examples they have a face powder
that retails for $16 they have a like
Matt Moore full coverage foundation that
retails for 16 dollars as well one of
their five pan eyeshadow palettes
retails for $15 and then they have this
like terracotta blush as well as a
terracotta powder and those are the most
expensive thing in their line
at least what I saw and they retail for
$18 a aesthetic of this brand is very
clean like black packaging very like
NARS asked in a way like it looks very
professional so I'm interested to try it
because if this is giving you like
really high-end quality that is a great
price for it but when you think again
comparing it to other drugstore brands
it's not necessarily SuperDuper
affordable you know it's a very basic
line but I do kind of want to know
quality wise where it stands we're
getting really close guys the next brand
is Winky looks and this is the other one
kind of like ladi London that you might
have heard of especially if you get
boxycharm because they do believe you
can get Winky looks products and boxy
terms if I'm not mistaken my note on
here is literally cute chip um all their
stuff their aesthetic is very cute they
have like those jelly lip balms I have
like the flower in them all of their
lipsticks look really cute they're in
this like gold packaging they look like
little almost like pills I guess you
could say they have like cats and like
pugs makeup bags I don't know it's just
a very like a giftable brand it's a very
like urban outfitters brand or something
to me for prices on their stuff it's
kind of oddly priced to me at least it's
kind of like this in between where it's
not super expensive but again it's not
necessarily like super affordable at the
drugstore or lip products they range
between like 14 and 17 dollars they have
some bronzers in their line that retail
for $20 and then they have two different
highlighters that I saw one is $10 and
then ones $18 which I thought was a
pretty big price gap that's kind of
where I didn't know like wait is it more
affordable or is it not I don't know if
maybe one's like a really small size I
don't know I don't know why those are
different prices I wrote on here that I
think this would be a great brand for
gifting makeup if you already have a lot
of stuff or you like aesthetic or
packaging this might be a brand to like
check out I've always kind of had it on
my radar just because I like the like
marketing that goes with it I guess like
this pink look and like you know fun
cool girl stuff yeah Winky Lux is on the
list
I'm really trying to finish this video
but my apologies if we got some crazy
noises the city of La is the City of LA
isn't it two more brands that we can do
this the next brand is called Frank body
and this is another one of those like
bath and body type of brands I cannot
lie the Frank body stuff just looks so
cute
the aesthetic is so
this reminds me of an Instagram kind of
beauty brand I don't like getting ads
but on my Instagram I love giving beauty
ads I love looking at the new
toothbrushes I like looking at all the
new beauty stuff whether it's makeup or
skincare I don't care I'm so interested
I love seeing the like beautiful
aesthetic but a lot of these brands have
I even go and check out like fruit
smoothies I get delivered to your door
that are all healthy like I just love
Instagram ads honestly if I'm being real
here anyway Frank body looks like it
would show up in your feed you'd click
over and it's giving you exactly what
you want I mean they even have the
scrubs in the bag so you know some of
the products that really are intriguing
me one of them is a shimmer scrub it
retails for $22 for the full size but
you can buy it in a smaller size for $12
and I believe it gives your body a
little bit of shimmer which sounds
really nice especially going into summer
they have some lip scrubs for 13 dollars
they have a lip tint which is like a
moisturizing lip situation for $12 and
then they have this face glow mask which
I'm just intrigued in again for that
glowy summer I don't know I just like it
with the brand it retails for $22 so I
wish this brand was a little bit less
expensive it would make me want to try
it more but it could be more expensive
you know I'm just cheap and the last
brand is actually a nail polish brand
this is Ella and Miele they do vegan 7
free polishes and they retail for 1050
so they're in the about the same price
range as Essie and OPI I actually did
find this brand originally through an
Instagram ad imagine it but I was really
surprised to see that they actually sell
them at Ulta so they have a ton of
different nail polish options a lot of
them are more neutral like you know
classic colors very like blogger s I
guess you could say they haven't mint
they haven't read but they're not doing
hot pinks and like hot oranges that's
not on the hair color scheme right now
at least they do sell lip products as
well you can get them on the Ulta site
in bundles with other products but
they're kind of expensive it's like a
$60 situation but if you want to check
out their lip products you can look at
them at the website and order that way
and then another product that was
interesting to me is their soy nail
polish remover
it retails for 1150 and this was just
different to me because I wonder if it's
like less harsh than your normal like
acetone or just normal nail polish
remover and I thought I would bring that
up in case anyone was looking for
something like that I haven't tried it
don't know if it's good but it exists so
and that's everything for the brands
guys I hope you guys enjoyed the video
let us know in the comments once again I
know I've repeated myself like a million
times but if you've tried any of these
things if you think they're worth it if
you think we should go for it what we
should stay away from I'd also love to
know if any of these brands were
actually new to you have you heard of
these before
am I just living under a rock is it just
me they're new to me but like everyone
else is just like oh yeah duh Lauren I'd
love to know and if there's any brands
that you think should get more hype you
don't feel like have enough love they
don't get shown here on YouTube I'd love
for you to leave them in the comments I
feel like we see a lot of the time the
same major brands over and over again
and that's great I love them don't get
me wrong it's just nice to give smaller
brands exposure give them the chance to
kind of shine see if they have some good
products maybe they don't but maybe they
do and they just don't have the exposure
or the reach of some of these other more
established brands so anyway I think I
might try some of these things out so
let me know if you'd like me to do like
a haul or like some type of review video
specifically talking about some of the
product from these brands in the future
I'd love to know I'll stop telling guys
to leave comments I'm sorry I love you
thank you for watching bye guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
