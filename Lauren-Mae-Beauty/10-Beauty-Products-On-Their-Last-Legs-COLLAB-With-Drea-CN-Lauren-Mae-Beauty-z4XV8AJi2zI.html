Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing a kind of
like weird project pan type of situation
that's basically just me showing you
some items that are so close to being
done they're on their last legs they're
almost finished and I'm kind of using
this as a push to get them out of my
collection I am actually doing this as a
collab with drea from drea CN here on
YouTube I actually just did a project
pan with her and in that video in the
finale I was saying how I wanted to do
this video
she DM me and was like hey I'd really
like to do that too that sounds really
good like I could use it so we decided
to do it together and I'm really excited
so definitely go check her channel out
if you haven't yet she's awesome she
does some awesome makeup looks and I
really enjoy her she's super sweet and
yeah go check her out these are all
items that I feel like I have about a
month's worth of use left on so I
definitely think that these should be
like quick hitters we're not sitting
here trying to pan them for forever
they're things that like I've already
done most of the legwork on and I just
need to like get them gone I'm hoping
this will be inspirational for me I've
been really into buying things lately
and drawing new things which has been so
fun and I've had a great time with it I
just think this will feel good to get
some like items completely out of my
collection and ready to kind of like let
some of that new stuff in you know what
I mean like I'll just feel better you
know how it is I want to have that
balance and I feel like this will help
kind of like tip the scales a little bit
the other direction since I have been
buying so much stuff so that all being
said let's just get into my items and
the goals I don't know what I'm gonna
update I don't know if I'm going to if
you're just gonna see these in you know
empties or whatnot let me know if you
want like a final update in about a
month like before I go to Italy
hopefully I can have these all done by
then the first item that I have here is
a candle this is the autumn leaves
candle from Chesapeake Bay I know this
seems like why would you put an autumn
scented candle in here but this is one
of my all-time favorite scents and it
reminds me of Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
Manko beechwood which they made one year
and then never made again because they
suck that was like my favorite scent
ever I really really liked it and this
smells so similar this is not smell like
autumn to me this smells like tropical
the beach it's mega beach boy baby so
anyway I know I'm
on to this because of the fact that it
only has a little bit left and I love it
so much I don't want to like let it go
but I know that I just need to get this
gone it's huge and I want to like buy
another one when it comes to fall next
year but I'm ready to finish this off
enjoy it and you know love every last
second of it but get it gone I'm really
working hard this year to get my candle
collection down I bought a couple cent
red ones and honestly I just went to the
bath and Bodyworks and bought Tiki Beach
it's the only what I bought I'm proud of
myself but I love that candle that's
like one of my all-time favorites so
before I can burn any of those though I
need to use up some of my old ones so
that's one of my goals this year next is
a product that I really love but I
really want to get it gone this is the
butter bronzer let's hold it the right
way I'm so happy that they have four
shades of this now and that it's just
like a more expanded range but this one
is in the light bronzer I believe that's
the one I've always used this will be my
second one I've gone through I am very
very close to being done with this ivory
pressed it and hit pan again there's
barely any product left so I'm just
using this again as a way to like really
focus in on this product hold for plain
so there's a little close-up of what I
have left not much it's very thin so I
definitely I think I can do it I
definitely think I can get this gone so
that is on the list and that'll feel so
great bronzers take a long time and I
just want it out although I know I'll be
repurchasing that one anyway I threw two
primers in here these are so tiny like
these are like baby baby samples so I
just want to get them gone I have like
an abundance of primers at the moment
and I love it it's so fun but these two
I think are ones that I could like get
out easy so I have the Too Faced primed
and PG I've used this a couple times but
it's the coaling matte skin perfecting
primer I have a larger size of this not
the full size but it's like half of the
full size a little more than half of the
full size so even once I go through this
I'll have more to go through and same
with this I have about a half ounce
sample of this again once I use it up
it's the Beca first light priming filter
I really enjoyed this primer I think
it's really nice if you want just like a
really nice like natural glow to your
skin maybe not even put makeup on just
like kind of as a moisturizer or if
you're someone who doesn't wear makeup
this would be so pretty on the skin yeah
I really like this but this has like a
couple uses left and again I just want
to like move these samples out I
a perfume here from scent bird this is
one I picked out a while ago it's funny
because the two scent bird scents that
I've ever picked out are both big sets
because I love it this is the comp tour
a sued Pacific Coco fig scent let's see
get my face out of there so that's what
I have left it's not much it's like half
and I love this scent it's like this oh
it's so good it's so sweet and I think
it's a great fig scent for summer it's
not like super it has a woodsy scent I
feel like the one I tried before this
was the melon and guts and that one is
like a fig woodsy kind of like dirty
wood fig scent and doesn't have too much
sweetness but this has that with some
sweetness to it so if you want more
sweet this is really nice and I'm going
to enjoy using it up I just kind of
forgot it had it it's just been sitting
by my other perfume so I think I can get
it gone and continue working through
some of those scents I have a foundation
here from makeup forever this is one
I've had for awhile I've kind of like
put it on the back burner because of the
fact that it's almost gone and it has my
initials in it look at that I got it at
generation Beauty quite a while ago and
I only have the Chinese bit like you can
see through the bottle look at me I'm
just so greedy I love showing you the
close-ups like this but you can see the
line there so I don't even think that I
have that much left on it but I want to
focus in use it up get it gone I know
I'm gonna be sad because this is one of
my favorite foundations but it's time
it's time to get it gone I haven't been
to a generation beauty in a long time so
it's time to go another foundation isn't
even in the same packaging anymore this
is the Lancome Tonti doll I think it's
time to are you guys tell me all the
time I'm so sorry I suck but this is the
stick foundation and this is what I have
left of it I put it in this container to
finish it up because I dug out there's
like half a stick left in there once you
use up all the like usable product that
you can get from just you know swiping
it on your face there's a lot of product
in there so if you have that product
definitely dig in find a little
container unless you don't like it I
guess throw it away but if you like it
there's a lot more left in there I
really love this product I think I'm
gonna repurchase it as well because I
want to take it to Italy with me so
we'll see but I want to finish this up
you know like I don't want to do pot
this I don't want this hanging around
anymore
I'm done with it so I want to finish
that up and again I can definitely do
that within a month if I'm using it
regularly next is a setting spray this
is my depotted Milani setting spray and
that's all I have left
oh it's like a fun house on my face
that's all I have left not much I
definitely think I can finish this up
I've been so into setting sprays I've
really been enjoying them
this one isn't my favorite like I love
the scent of it I don't find that it
keeps my makeup on any longer and I find
that that's not really what I'm looking
for in a setting spray anyway I really
wanted to like melt down my makeup and
give me a skin like finish and when I'm
using these like more mattifying ones I
just don't feel like that's what happens
I feel like I just look more powdery or
the same amount of powder is before so
yeah I want to get this gone I probably
won't repurchase it I did just purchase
the Too Faced one I got the full size I
love it so much so yeah I want to get
this gone and just kind of move through
it because I have some other great ones
in my collection oh my gosh so I just
got an iPhone and it was taking notes of
what I'm saying oh my gosh that's insane
the Freak it's hard for me I'm used to
my LG g5 and this is a I'm very
appreciative and I love it I got it so
that when we're in Italy I can take like
actually great photos but they're really
like easy and accessible to do but it's
definitely a learning curve getting used
to a whole new like operating system on
a phone anyway I'm super chatty once
again in these videos but I have to face
masks that I'm kind of counting as one
the reason I have these in here is
because like you only have to use them
once and then they're gone I don't love
sheet masks because I feel
claustrophobic and I have so many other
like regular masks in my collection
right now so I just need to move through
these and I've had these ones a while so
I have a flora P clear complexion mask
this one looks a little janky and then I
have a patch ology one which I'm excited
to try because I've really enjoyed the
patch ology stuff that I have tried in
the past I've had they're like little
eye masks I have the lip mask I have
like a lip balm from them so this is the
illuminating flash mask so I want to get
through those again their one-time use
so I can definitely use these up within
a month because really I could use them
up in 15 minutes just got to do it all
right and I saved the hardest for last
this one I don't know if I can do it
guys but I'm feeling a little extra
and a little excited for it so I have my
tart blush and party and as you can see
here I can see the ring I can see the
Rings
I think pans on the way so I am going to
hopefully hit pan on this that is the
goal I think I can do that in a month
I've really been enjoying this when I
went to Oregon I only brought like very
limited makeup because I just did a
carry-on and we were gone for like five
days so that was like hard for me that
was like difficult but this was the only
blush that I brought so I used it every
single day there and we have some great
progress going so it would feel really
awesome if I could hit pan on this I
think this might be in my like year-long
goal project maybe if not I'll feel
really satisfied to have another item
with pan on it though so yeah I really
want to use this up I realized that
blushes I like literally could stick to
the same like seven blushes and I'd be
good but I have some tag videos coming
up I'm gonna do the blushes Bay tag
which is like old I'm so sorry Danny and
everyone else who's like tagged me in
that like a long time ago sorry I'm
sorry I'm getting to it I also want to
do the aesthetic tag by LS so like I
have some tag videos coming up that has
nothing to do with this really except
for the fact that there's a blush tag
and this is a blush and I want to do
those okay that's it I'm gonna end this
video here thank you guys so much for
watching and don't forget to go check
out Dre as a video especially if you
want some inspiration I'm really hoping
it'll get you guys to also look through
your collection see what items are like
on the fritz they look about to go and
just like punch it through you know like
finish him off some of these things
might even only take a week of like
constant use for me to get through and
then you're they're out they're gone and
you can have room for other new things
in your collection or if you're trying
to relieve pare down your collection
your one less item there so thanks for
watching I hope it's inspiring and I
will see you in the next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
