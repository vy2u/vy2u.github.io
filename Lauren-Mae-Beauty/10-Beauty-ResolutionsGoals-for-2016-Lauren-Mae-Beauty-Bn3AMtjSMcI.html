channel it's Lauren I'm gonna start off
this video with a couple things I'm
going to be filming quite a few videos
today and as we get closer to the end of
the month and Christmas I'm going to be
filming more videos in one day sittings
because I am going back home to see my
family for Christmas for 10 days and I
just don't want to feel pressured to
make content while I'm there so I'd
rather still have content for you guys
and uploaded during the holidays and
afterward as well as see my family and
enjoy that so I might try to film some
stuff along there but again I just don't
want that to be like my main focus and
there to see them and enjoy the holidays
and everything so I just wanted to give
you a heads up you will be seeing me in
this lip before a couple videos also I
wanted to say that if you hear like lawn
noise in the back I'm really sorry but
it feels like every day I try to film
they you know come around and blow
leaves this is so I'm really sorry about
that but hopefully it's not too
distracting in the background let's get
into this video I'm kind of doing this
video early but this is going to be my
beauty resolutions for 2016 so I've come
up with 10 beauty resolutions that I'd
like to stick to this year these are all
kind of helping me stay on track for not
necessarily completely condensing down
my collection to nothing but just making
sure that everything in my collection
are things I love that I'm actually
going through and using that products
instead of hoarding them so a lot of
these Beauty resolutions revolve around
that type of attitude like project
panning and things like that in our
community so number one I want to keep
track I have a paper here like I always
do I want to keep track of all my makeup
purchases throughout the year so
starting on the first whatever items a
purchase whether it's with a gift card
with my money with whatever I want to
keep those purchases like logged in I'll
probably use this sheet and just love
them month by month I think that's just
a great way to see what you're actually
buying I know sometimes if I'm at the
drugstore and it happened just like
throw a few things in my cart I live on
here a mascara there I tend to forget I
even bought them and that
just kind of dissolves into nothing I
just kind of want to see throughout the
year at the end of the year how much
actually spent it can kind of give me a
gauge of like something I bought in
January when I'm looking back in June
like oh I've never even used that item
I'm not going on a no buy this year but
I am trying to really limit myself on
what I buy so I'm excited to just see
what my really loose rules for myself
are and how that works with what I'm
buying
anyway that's number one write down
everything i buy including the price and
even things I'm gifted I think I'm gonna
like put in there just any new beauty
products coming into my life
this year I just want to have them on
one concise list number two you guys
already know about I want to hit pan on
as many eyeshadows as they possibly can
this upcoming year
I have already like listed out how many
eyeshadows I've hit pan on and in the
video that I've talked about my
eyeshadows and this whole thing I'll
link it down below but I had hit pan on
like six eyeshadows and I think I'm up
to nine already so already doing great
job in the year hasn't even started so
I'm really excited about this project I
feel really passionate about it I was
really trying to find something that
would give myself freedom to use
different shades and not be confined to
necessarily like one palette all year
long but still wanting and craving that
pan and seeing progress in my collection
and moving things out of my collection
someone had mentioned in that video to
like put a goal on what at how many
eyeshadows I want to use up throughout
the year so I am gonna try to use up 25
like that's my goal number hopefully I
can use it more I don't even know if
that's a lot but I feel like if I'm
multitasking things I can do it that's
like two eyeshadows a month plus like an
extra one somewhere in there I think I
can do it I wanna you hit pan on as many
eyeshadows as possible but I'd like to
hit pan on at least 25 for the year
another Beauty resolution number three I
want to use up two full-size perfumes
this year you guys have seen me work
through my perfumes throughout my
project use it up videos I have had some
I think in project pan videos like my
older ones and next year I really want
to focus in on some bigger perfumes I've
been using rollerballs and like a mini
I want to go in and really cut down
those bigger bottles in my collection
that I don't like or that I just don't
represent me any longer and I'm excited
about that that will be hard but awesome
for number four there are certain items
in my collection I'm forbidding myself
from buying this year because I just
have too many there is no reason I need
any more of these items the only way I
can buy any of these items as if I
happen to run out of them so potentially
if I use all of them up I can do that
but I highly doubt that I'll be able to
do that or at least not for most of the
year so the items that I'm not allowing
myself to buy this year are shower gels
if you've seen my declutter video of
like all my bath stuff I have so many
shower gels and honestly it just takes a
long time to use them up hopefully this
doesn't gross anyone out but I don't
shower every day I don't feel the need
to shower every day I like conserving
that water and so I don't even use
shower gel every single day and I have
so many shower gels so it's just
something I don't need in my life right
now I have a hoard of it and I just want
to go through what I have and Whittle
that down instead of adding to it so no
shower gels this year I'm not allowed to
buy any cream blushes this year I know
that I bought the Stila water color like
liquid blush this year and it's still in
the package so I've just decided
although they are beautiful I've also
had to throw in a way that went bad I
just don't want to buy any this year I
want to work through the ones I have and
to not add to it so no cream blushes no
eyeliners I kind of set this goal for
myself this year and I didn't do a good
job so the only eyeliners I'm allowed to
buy are like the liquid felt tip one and
I just want one at a time so they don't
dry out that's the only one I'm allowed
to buy pencil liners there's no way I
have so many and I need to go through
them so no eyeliners no body lotions I
don't feel like a million body lotions
but I have quite a few especially for
how fast I go through them I don't use
body lotions so I don't buy any body
lotion and I really like to work through
almost all of them this year if I can
and the last one I'm not allowed to buy
I'm not allotted by hand creams I have
just oh so many hand creams I don't know
what it is about hand creams that I love
to buy but I don't need to buy me and I
think I can use that the hand creams I
have been in of the year
but I definitely don't need to add to
them until I get to that point so no
hampers we're only on number five okay
number five for my beauty resolutions I
wrote on here and this one's gonna be
the hardest one for me because I have
been trying to wear more lipsticks and
stuff but I put on here that I'm only
allowed to buy five lip products and
then after that I can only replace lip
products so I can only add five new lip
products to my collection this year and
then if I want to buy any more lip
products than that then I need to get
rid of a lip product in my collection to
add that lip product to it hopefully
that makes sense I really just don't
want to have a hoard of lip products I
really want just lip products to
actually like to use lately I've been
really into liquid lipsticks I'm wearing
Kat Von D's damned if you're wondering
on my lips today I also will count like
if I used up a lip product and I'm
throwing it away that can count as a new
product I can add so let's say in a
project pan I use up a lip product then
I can kind of I don't have to get rid of
one I already got rid of that one hmm
hopefully again that makes sense but
it's just a way for me since I know how
I am with lip products it's so hard for
me to go through them I don't need a
million of them and I feel like honestly
right now in my collection I'm not
getting rid of some things although I
could and I think there's other things
out there I'd like better so instead of
having both I'm gonna make myself if I
want a new one I have to get rid of
another one after five okay hopefully
that makes sense okay number six I want
to use up three body splashes this year
I have probably almost ten body splashes
maybe only eight and I bought them all a
long time ago I haven't been into a bath
and Bodyworks I think almost all year
it's crazy I'm so proud of myself but I
have a lot of body splashes and I just
don't go through them I don't need them
and I'd rather have perfume so I just
want to use up three of them this year
number seven you guys know I tried to do
a project polish this year props to
everyone who can do project polish it is
so hard for me it's kind of like lip
products like as soon as I pick the ones
in my project polish that I think I'll
love and want to use
I'm really into I changed my mind and
want to use something totally different
and it just makes it impossible and then
I feel like it's such a chore to use my
nail polishes and I have such a hoard of
nail polishes as well story in my life I
just hoard stuff but I have so many male
polishes so then it's like gosh I'm at
least I'm using it like it's better to
paint your nails than to not paint your
nails right if you're trying to use it
polish and use your collection so this
year I want to try to use up six
polishes I haven't picked those six
polishes but it would just be nice to
get some of them out and actually use
them so that's my goal and I want to use
up six that's one per every two months I
don't think that's too bad
I think it's more doable especially for
me and I do have some that I'm like
halfway done with from my last project
polish or from my project polish today
is back then but I can also use those
and kind of get some of those out if I
really need to number eight I want to go
through and declutter my brushes I'm the
type of person I love brushes and I have
quite a few but I used mostly the same
ones over and over and over again I know
there's some in my collection that I
don't need I've held on to a lot of the
ones that are like bigger brushes that
come in like bronzers and stuff and I
just want to go through them I haven't
declutter my brushes I don't think ever
and I thought that would be a good thing
to try to do this year and I'd rather
just have really awesome brushes and
just use those I don't need eight
million fan brushes to all put
highlighter on that's just what I'm
thinking I think I would be a good one
number nine I've realized I don't use my
samples I just don't use them I just AM
a full-sized product or even like a
travel sized deluxe sizes I'm okay with
I just hate foil packets I don't like
using foil packets they're just annoying
to me so I don't I just don't use up any
samples I get so I am making sure that
when I'm not buying anything for sample
products like that is not it's not worth
it to me because I don't use the sample
so I end up buying something I wouldn't
have bought to get samples that I'm not
gonna use and I don't want to do that
anymore but I'm giving myself a limit
now on using my samples up so I have to
use my foil packet samples up in two
weeks after getting it
and if I don't then I need to give them
away because I obviously don't want to
use it that bad if I haven't used it in
half a month and you know it's a new
fresh product that I just got if I don't
use it it needs to go away
I think that's a great way to keep the
clutter down in my collection I'm
excited for that one number 10 the last
way or the last beauty resolution I have
this year it goes back to buying
products and I think this one's going to
be the most like it's going to be
difficult but I feel like it's really
going to help me with not buying
products and that is I have to talk to
Sam and tell Sam about every single
Beauty purchase I'm going to make so I
can't just be here at home and decide to
go on Sephora's website and buy stuff
and then tell him about it afterward or
just like put it in my collection and
not really mention it and I'm not I'm
not saying I did that all the time but I
definitely I did not tell him about it
it was just always after the fact like
after it's already here like oops a
whole big box came to the house oops I
don't want to do that anymore I think
that's a way that I am able to justify
spending money or kind of concealed
spending money on makeup that I don't
need and I think it's going to curb a
lot of really spontaneous purchases and
instant gratification purchases and just
impulsive purchases that I've made in
the past for example Sephora just gave
out a coupon that was like save 25 off
$50 purchase and I told him I want to
use that up I want to use that coupon
and I told him I was gonna use it and
stay really close to the 50 so that I
was only spending you know definitely
less than $50 for my whole purchase and
you know that just made me accountable
and I couldn't go over that like just
because I was getting excited on the
site because I already talked to him
about this I'd already made this like
agreement with him similarly I did the
same thing with the Gwen Stefani palette
I told him like I want this palette I
really want this palette and I think
just talking to him about it
and I don't know that conversation just
kind of had me slowed down on my
thoughts instead of just clicking the
Buy button it just slowed me down on my
purchase and I ended
not even getting that palette and I'm
really happy that it didn't so anyway
that's just one personal for me I don't
know how you guys are in your
relationships with your husband or your
spouse or a few single but I think just
talking to someone about a purchase that
you want to make just makes you more
accountable and if you tell someone I'm
gonna oh I really want this one palette
then when you go and you buy you buy
that one palette you don't buy that
palette and like ten other items at
least that's what I'm hoping it'll do
for me so those are my beauty
resolutions for 2016 I'm really excited
for 2016 I'm really happy lately with
where I am in my mindset for my
collection and for myself and just in my
buying habits I really want to focus on
buying things for myself that I'll love
and cherish and besides just makeup
because I spend a lot of my money on
makeup and I want to spend it on other
things I want to go on trips even though
we do that I want to go on more trips or
just have more money to do other things
besides buy makeup and horded and my
drawers alright guys I hope you enjoyed
this video I would love to know your
guys's beauty resolutions so like let me
know if you make a video down below or
