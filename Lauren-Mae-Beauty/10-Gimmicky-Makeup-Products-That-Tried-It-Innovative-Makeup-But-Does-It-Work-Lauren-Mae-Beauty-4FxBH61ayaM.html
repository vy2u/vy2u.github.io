Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought it would be fun to talk
about some gimmicky products that tried
it I think we all know by now that a lot
of brands have come up with some more
gimmicky products and how I defined
gimmicky is something that is outrageous
or crazy or different and it feels like
just to be different just to get your
attention it's not necessarily actually
solving a problem there is it seems no
real reason for this other than it looks
cool or it's funny or it's slimy or
whatever it is so today I thought it'd
be fun to talk about some of those
products that I think are gimmicky I
have not tried anything on this list so
I would love to know if these things
actually worked out for you I know I
myself have tried some products that I
thought for sure we're not gonna work or
that were stupid or whatever it was and
they ended up being really great so
sometimes these gimmicks can be great so
definitely let us know if you've tried
any of these things and had success
because I think that would be really
interesting but these are all products
that I feel like at one point or another
were featured on a lot of the larger
channels because they had some weird
thing about them and I feel like for the
most part these items have kind of just
disappeared and they aren't really a
part of people's normal routines they
aren't like everyday staples in any way
they mostly are just there for us to
gawk and haw hat and yeah I think it'll
be fun so let's just get into the items
I have this is by no means everything
this is just everything I could think of
at the moment so the first item on my
list is the ciate London glitter flip
liquid lipsticks I remember when so many
people were coming out with videos
showcasing how these work and if you
haven't heard about these it's basically
a liquid lipstick formula you put it on
and then you let it sit I think you're
like two minutes or something like that
and then once you rub your lips together
all this glitter appears and it's like a
really fun cool idea especially if you
love glitter it's always fun to see that
instantaneous change where a product
goes from something to something
completely different
and so a lot of people were doing videos
on them and
and now I literally it's like they never
existed I think they might have been
limited-edition I'm not sure if you can
still get these products but yeah that
one to me is like completely gimmick I
feel like most people in their everyday
you know life aren't wearing glitter
lipsticks not that you shouldn't but
it's just not most people's cup of tea
on the arid day but I think these were
really cool products and I'm glad they
worked I will say that sugar pill has a
very similar situation to this I don't
feel like it's as big of a difference
but their trinket liquid lipstick is
very similar where the more you wear it
the more the golden shimmer comes out in
that product and so that's the first one
I think this one is kind of in the
middle like I don't think this is just
like a horrible product or it just
doesn't work or anything like that but I
definitely think that the fact that it
flips is really its biggest selling
point it's not necessarily a formula or
color selection or anything like that
it's all about the glitter and how like
it's magic the next item I have on the
list is from pure and this is a more
recent one this is their powder to cream
concealer I saw that Taylor do a video
using this product and I also think Tati
did a video using this product and
honestly no one really likes it it's a
very strange idea to go from a powder to
a cream especially when you think about
the under eye area and how I mean really
I feel like you don't want too much
powder on the under eye because you
don't want it to look like creepy or
anything or wrinkly or just anything
like that it's just a very delicate area
of the face but then you also don't want
a product that is going to crease a lot
so this one just seems so strange if it
changes in the cream because of the heat
is it going to crease I don't know it's
just a very weird product again it's
very gimmicky to me the only reason I
feel like people try this out is because
it's like such a whoa it's a cream but
it's a powder but wait it's a powder
first and then a cream and that's why
people tried it out I think we all go
into things hoping it'll work but this
one I don't think did I don't think it
got any positive reviews and I don't see
it being a product that people employ in
their everyday life next we're moving on
to glitter masks more glitter glitter is
just like a fun flashy thing isn't it I
think there are only two different
brands that have the glitter masks on
the market I could be wrong but I'm
pretty sure there's a two-faced glow job
mask
which I freaking hate the name of so
much and then there is the glam glow
glitter masks and their newly coming out
with their like limited edition My
Little Pony all the different color ones
and to me this is like a complete
gimmick because this glitter is doing
nothing to help your skin obviously
there's no scientific studies that are
like you know what glitter helps your
skin retain moisture or gets rid of fine
lines like this is completely for the
show of it and I can admit that this is
like pretty slime it's pretty goop in a
jar for sure but I just think for the
price time that you're paying because of
these products I just I just don't like
that for my skincare for me personally
it's not worth the selfie on Instagram
to pay that price for that product and I
think this one is a complete gimmick I
think there's sometimes a fine line as a
brand you want to come up with something
innovative and creative and I get that
and I want to see that I want to see
cool new things but I just don't think
this one quite worked out and I think it
kind of can sometimes hurt the
credibility of your brand depending on
what you come out with I think for me
gimmicks need to be cheap and then maybe
I'll try them out there is so much
playing activity in this video you don't
know how many times I had to freaking
stop for the freaking planes everyone's
flying somewhere next on the list I have
the lancome rose highlighter and this is
probably the most beautiful gimmick on
here the thing that is gonna get you the
most most likely especially if you like
to display makeup or if you're a really
big time collector this was a product
that was a loose highlighter that was
sprinkled on top of a fake rose in a big
ol really beautiful packaged jar and
it's like a box container this is
beautiful I think that they did a really
great job marketing this it looked so
good and that's one of the things with
gimmicky products if it's packaged
correctly my goodness can they sell it
but there are a lot of reasons that this
is kind of gimmicky one a lot of people
like a blinding highlight and this was
not a blinding highlight this is
definitely something more subtle but two
there is barely any product in this
thing and I think that's the biggest
thing is like you are paying for fake
rose sprinkled with some like dust of
but the amount of product in there was
just nothing it just it completely is
for show it's like not even makeup to be
worn I feel like let me know if you
picked that one up if you use it if you
like it because I feel like that's one
that maybe more people would have bought
instead of just watching fun videos on
because it was really beautiful but even
something really pretty can be super
gimmicky next I have a foaming product
this is a foundation from Elizabeth
Arden that foams up and I think I saw
mani do a video on this I don't know who
else I saw I think that was mostly it
but this product it's so strange I feel
like it's coming from such a strange
brand from Elizabeth Arden because they
are a more if you like mature makeup
line they aren't coming out with a ton
of like gimmicky products but this one
made its way into youtubers hands and it
was a part of like a lot of WTF series
it's just like weird I don't know why we
need foaming foundation I honestly don't
know why this would be a better way to
apply foundation on to the skin besides
normal methods and normal like
consistencies of foundation but yeah
this one was definitely interesting it's
like it has the wow factor but it's just
a gimmick it's such a gimmick you don't
need your foundation or foam no they
tried it on that one for sure next I
have the color-changing products I feel
like these are just one of those things
that just come back in cycles
color-changing mood changing and in what
they all do for me at least they all are
just freakin hot pink no matter what's
gonna happen I know that this product is
going to be hot pink on me and it's
going to freakin stain me for forever
specifically what comes to mind when I
think about this is the lipstick Queen
Frog Prince they have a cream blush they
have a cream lipstick I think they might
have like one other thing maybe a lip
gloss they're all green but when you use
them they turn pink and they kind of
turn more like a rosy pink than a super
hot pink but I I'm sure on me they would
turn hot pink because my goodness no
matter what it's always frickin hot pink
on me but these are one of those things
that you look at you're like ah green
blush but then once you use it and you
use you know a small amount it actually
is really pretty and this one is just
trying to be different I feel like I
think it's
cool idea don't get me wrong I think
maybe because we've seen it so much or I
feel like this technology or whatever it
is like the the pH balance it's your
specific color I think it's just heat
right I don't think it's necessarily a
hundred percent actually doing different
shades maybe it's like a different level
of the same color but it's not
completely different shades I've just
seen it so much that it's not that
special to me and it just feels like a
gimmick next I have a few products from
benefit and I feel like they either do
their classic stuff or they kind of go a
little bit more on the gimmicky route
where you know you're using an eyeshadow
and it's in three different stripes and
you can just apply it on your eye that
way or something like that like cut
doesn't work like that actually doesn't
freaking work but I didn't write that
one even down instead I have the lip
liner and lipstick duos this is like in
a teardrop shape where you're supposed
to be able to line and fill in your lips
with lipstick all at one time they are
solving problems that we didn't even
know we have I just don't think that
having a lipstick and a lip liner and
applying them separately is a is a
problem to be solved I guess and
sometimes that's what these gimmicks are
like trying to do like we're solving
these problems and I'm sitting here like
didn't didn't know that was a thing kind
of like this hack video sometimes these
hack videos have tips and hacks on how
to do things that are like way more
complicated than the original like
procedure of doing it so those to me you
just kind of were a little bit gimmicky
I wish they would just come out with
some bomb lip sticks and some bomb lip
liners that would be awesome instead of
putting all the time and marketing you
money into those products I thought it
would take the time here to also mention
their liner it was a gel liner they're
real liner I think that's what it was I
got a sample of this this is probably
the only one I've tried it is actually
the only one I've tried from this list
and I got a little sample sent to me
from Ulta when it first launched I was
living at my mom's house I like remember
getting it because I was so excited I
was like why did I'll just send this to
me this is such a cool thing it was like
part of their promo inge and marketing
for that product and yeah it just is the
most difficult thing ever this one I can
I can see the problem that they're
trying to solve where you know it's just
one application
you don't have to clean your brush and
all that but it just doesn't work it's
like it's a gimmick to me if it ends up
not working and not actually solving the
problem for me I could not get this to
stay on my I the product would like roll
off it was just a mess it was such a
mess and don't think it worked well I
know a lot of people did some like
sponsored content and like talked about
these but now they were not good I wish
they would have come out with potted
eyeliners come out with pen style
eyeliners just done something different
because this one I feel like was such a
fail and such a gimmick and last keeping
on the topic of liners we have the Mack
roller lash liner or whatever it is I
think it's the roller liner is that what
it is everyone's like the pizza cutter
liner I saw so many freaking videos on
this thing I don't know if this works I
feel like this is a gimmicky product but
I think this one actually has potential
to work I know a lot of people didn't
like it I saw some first impressions
where it was just a complete fail which
I don't know maybe it is or maybe it has
a slight learning curve to it I'm not
sure because I did see some stuff on the
Mac Instagram with people using it and
it looked really awesome you can also do
some cooler things like not necessarily
you know your typical winged liner but
doing more avant-garde or artsy types of
things and it looked really cool but
this one for sure the reason that it got
all the height is because of the roller
wheel liner if this was just a regular
liquid liner that came on the market I
doubt it would get any hype at all and
or even mentioned but because it has
that different cool thing it was
featured in a lot of videos I would love
to know if you tried that one if it
worked or not because that one is one of
the ones in here kind of like the ciaté
one the one we started with those
glitter flips they are gimmicky but I
mean they still work and serve a purpose
maybe they're not part of your everyday
but you know they could work they just
have that extra wow factor to like get
people to buy them or talk about them or
have some buzz that is everything for
the gimmicky products like I mentioned
throughout the video I really want to
know if you've tried these things if you
like them do you like it make your
products do you like seeing brands come
out with like new innovative things
just I know like I'm not probably gonna
spend my money on them it is always cool
when you're surprised by an item that is
more gimmicky and it works and I also do
sometimes enjoy watching like people
test them out and do those fun videos I
mean it's just entertainment but it's
makeup entertainment so of course I'm
like down for it so I'd love to hear
your thoughts in the comments thank you
so so much for watching guys and I will
see you in the next video what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
