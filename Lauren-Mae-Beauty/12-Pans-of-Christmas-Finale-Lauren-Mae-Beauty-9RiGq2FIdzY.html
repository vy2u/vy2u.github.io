Lauren and thanks for watching this is
the long-awaited finale for the 12 Pan's
of Christmas I was out of town if you
guys follow me on Instagram you all know
that and I really just didn't play my
life very well I didn't bring any of
these products with me in Arizona even
though I brought me filming stuff I
didn't have time to film even if I
wanted to but even if I did I don't have
the products it was all hot mess so we
decided to let go of the stress of that
and just enjoy my holiday and filming
this when I could so this is when I
could film it I also want to say at the
beginning really really fast thank you
so much to Jacqueline again for just
putting this whole thing together and
getting all these lovely ladies together
in this project I'm so happy so many
people wanted to join in I tried my best
to keep on top of like adding you guys
if I could to the description and
everything so she's such a sweetheart
she's just like a really genuine person
I really really enjoy her and to
everyone too and our email chain as much
as I didn't respond I read everything so
um yeah I was just nice to get to know
people on a different level and I really
enjoyed that
so let's you know just get into this
let's finish this up let's wrap it up
right we'll talk about how successful I
was as we go but a recap on some of the
products they finished last time you
guys know I finished the Makeup Forever
HD foundation I wasn't able to get any
more out of this this isn't my favorite
foundation for myself and my skin type I
feel like this is a great foundation for
what it was made for for TV and film but
it just doesn't work on my skin type for
like a 12-hour day another makeup
forever product this is the translucent
powder HD one this was okay I do have a
bigger size of this that I'm going to
finish up this year but I did enjoy
using this glad I could get this little
jar out this is a sad woman this is my
butter bronzer my goal was to hit pan on
this and I did hit pan on it last time
and they also dropped it and broke it it
fell all over the floor at my mom's
house and she had like dogs and stuff
and I was just like nope I'm not
repressing it so it's gone I'm not gonna
count this as products I used up because
I didn't technically use it up so I'm
just gonna throw it out but I love this
bronzer I missed this bronzer I went and
bought a different one because I didn't
bring much with me but I love this
highly recommend so so so good
I miss it so much the Boyne concealer
was also something that I had used up by
last update and it's completely done I
don't like this I don't suggest it I
think there's just a million other
concealers that you can get for either
cheaper that are the same or better that
are more or than like just no this is
not that good but I think that's it for
things I used up last time so I did
finish up the eyebrow pencil this is
from eBay and it's all the way done I
did enjoy this pencil I think it's
really good I I think this cost me like
75 cents which is totally worth it but I
don't know if I'll repurchase it just
because it takes a while to get here and
I know it's good I'm not saying I won't
I'm not saying I will I suggested if you
were interested and want something super
cheap but it's also just like a cheap
little product at the same time if that
makes sense
this Smashbox contour palettes done guys
I finished this really happy about it I
was working on this last product here
the contour and I finished it so this
whole palettes done I don't think I've
ever finished up like a legit palette so
this is a huge accomplishment for me I'm
so excited to throw this in my 2016
makeup empties which will be coming just
so you know I'm not filming it in this
group of video so just look out for it
it's gonna be a little bit later but
also spoiler I have all my makeup from
the year before that to still so I have
like two years of makeup that I think I
might just like put together at the end
I think it'll just be interesting to see
how much makeup I've used up since being
on YouTube and trying to pan stuff but
anyway I'm getting ahead of myself let's
continue with this project right and
sadly that's it that's all used up
definitely not as much as I wanted to
but in my defense I don't know I don't
need to explain crap but I was really
busy in December and I thought I wasn't
going to be so some things in here just
didn't work with my lifestyle and that's
cool I'd rather you know have a job then
do that so I made it work and other
times I just wanted to like have fun and
that also was awesome so I don't regret
anything never gret I had like a million
primers in here the first one is the
Becca ever matte I wanted to finish this
up in this year and then if I didn't
throw it away this year but I'm not
going to
finish it I'm so dating close I got down
to here so at the beginning of the
project I know it's hard to see lines I
was up here then I was down here and now
I'm at this line here so I barely have
any of this product left I was finding a
way to make this work and I wasn't
hating it as much as I did in the
beginning but it's definitely not
something I would repurchase so I can
see other people maybe making it work
but it's not my favorite I just want to
use it up I'm so dang close you know
it's one of those similarly this is the
tarte lipsurgence in exposed it's
pathetic really that's it that's all
that's left this is maybe like a week's
worth of youth I just didn't use it I
was using other things I knew guys no I
don't use a ton of lip product so that
will take no time at all though so I'll
be happy to have that in my empties for
2017 I have a little perfume guy here
this is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana
white really I didn't make it past where
I was last time so I started here got to
here stayed there I have this in the
full-size and I just I've realized it's
just not my favorite scent I think I
bought this because of the hype and I do
like the way this tent matures on my
skin like as I wear it it kind of warms
up and smells better but the initial
application of this doesn't smell that
great and I just found that in the times
I was wearing perfume because I wore
perfume all last month I just didn't
want to wear this this doesn't represent
me this isn't what I want to like smell
like to people you know I want to smell
like molecule or those other laura
mercier perfumes that I got recently so
those are what I was using and I didn't
use this so we'll be getting through
this in 2017 as well as my big one I'm
just gonna try to layer it and see if
that helps
back to primers I don't know why I
didn't talk about these with the other
one I had these two primers this is the
Revlon beyond natural honestly I think I
use this one time it's basically done
I'm just like being a stickler about it
like having to be a hundred percent done
so I don't know I might just try and
squeeze this all out into like a little
container so I can just use it out of
that don't make it so much easier in the
morning and then I can just call it done
because seriously there's nothing left I
don't know what my problem is some
actual progress this is the pure
correcting primer and it is just a
deluxe size but I started the project
here I came down to here and then
how much I used in between the time
definitely used more of this this helped
so much in Arizona I just so good as
Gracie in Arizona and I missed that I
realized that's what changed in my skin
because I remember being in Arizona and
yeah I'd get oily but I wouldn't ever
get like just crazy greasy like I am
here and it's because I'm sure that it's
dry over there this just helped kind of
give a little bit more moisture to my
skin I do like it I think if you want
something that's luminizing but not too
luminizing or just if you have normal or
dry skin this would be really nice thank
goodness there's like three more
products to talk about this is my urban
decay liner in 1999 now I probably could
have finished this if I used it everyday
I am wearing it today though this just
wasn't dark enough for me on some days
and I just wanted something different on
my tight line so that's why I didn't use
it Plus this has a lot of glitter and
sometimes I didn't want to deal with the
glitter in my tight line so I will
continue to use this and finish it up I
do enjoy the color
I wouldn't repurchase it though at this
point it's not a color that I think I'll
miss once it's gone the lip liner my
gosh I'm so close I don't know why I
couldn't finish this but I just didn't
I'm not gonna get rid of it because I'm
so freaking close but it was a good
attempt Lauren I'm proud of you it's so
close this will definitely be done in
2017 though that's a positive right
and last the contour and highlight stick
from hard candy now I mostly wanted to
finish up the contour the highlight if
possible
there's just no way when I'm waking up
super early in the morning that I'm
gonna contour my face so if you look in
there I did use up quite a bit of it but
I just would have had to make this an
everyday item it did break off if you
can tell I am notorious for breaking off
my products this packaging is just kind
of hard to twist up and down so I don't
know if I do purchase it again the
product itself is good like specifically
the contour side I like it
it's just the packaging is kind of hard
to twist especially if you have like
product on your hand in the morning and
all that anyway I didn't finish it I'm
going to continue working
and I think I can get that out this year
as well so whoo that's it that's my
finale I've been singing races videos -
so congratulations to everyone for
getting those last few products at their
collection I'm so excited - for the new
projects coming up this in 2017
this year when I'm filming like
currently let's do this I have to intro
so I'm about to film they're both
collapse which is awesome and I'm really
excited for them so thank you to all the
wonderful ladies that were in this
collab it was fun just you know working
closer with you guys and you know coming
together as communities so that's
everything I wish you guys the best and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
