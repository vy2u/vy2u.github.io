Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing the finale
for my 12 Pan's of Christmas project pan
I'm really excited for it I will say
though I don't think I did the best in
this project but a few things before we
get into that I just want to say thank
you to everyone who jumped in on this
project I want to say thank you so much
to Jacqueline for just organizing this
whole thing it was a lot to take in this
is a lot of project panners in this like
collab type video it kind of got crazy
so I just thank her so much for putting
in the time and effort I'm gonna leave
her channel linked specifically down
below and then obviously everyone else's
videos like they happen are gonna be in
the playlists so I definitely suggest
checking that out if you're into project
panning if you want some inspiration to
use some of your products up if you want
to find some new youtubers to watch so
that's gonna be listed down below as
well as the people who joined us in on
Instagram so lots of stuff down there
check it out but going into how I
specifically did for this project I
don't feel like I'm like a failure I
just don't I don't know what it was I
feel like it started strong then it got
weak then I got weaker
I think traveling back to Arizona was
kind of part of it and just the holidays
in general I am happy and I learned a
lot so I'll talk about that and just
some updates and stuff at the end of
this video but yeah let's get into it if
you haven't checked out my other videos
definitely check them out but as I was
my last update I did end up decluttering
a couple of items so I got rid of the
Milani blush it just didn't suit me
anymore it wasn't something I wanted to
reach for and that's what I wanted this
project to be is a way for me to decide
if these items were a good fit for my
collection
I think sometimes project panning can be
looked at as something negative like
you're forcing yourself to use up makeup
and in a way you are but you have choice
and if you don't want to use something
to me that that says something to me do
I need this in my collection anymore and
sometimes it's hard to get rid of makeup
for whatever reasons whatever
attachments you have to it and when I
find myself not using something in a
project pan I sometimes think of that as
like a sign that this item is ready to
be let go of that it can be passed on
and I'm not going to miss it because I
don't even want to use it when I'm kind
of like setting my ship you know what I
mean so any
I got rid of the blush I also got rid of
a NARS palette and I think that's
everything I declared just those two
things but those were pretty big items
and harder ones for me to let go with
but I'm happy that they're gone some
things like new stuff I did use up the
NARS foundation this had pan on it but I
definitely finished it out
I enjoy this foundation I think it looks
really nice on the skin the color of it
was a little bit pink for me I feel like
it kind of gotten a little darker on my
skin I'm not I'm not sure it was like I
loved it sometimes I hated it sometimes
but finish wise I absolutely loved it so
I probably I mean I would still probably
purchase this again though it is kind of
hard to find I've been looking for it on
a bunch of different sites and it's just
it's just really hard so I don't know if
that's being discontinued but if it
isn't I would repurchase it the only
other thing I think I've actually
officially used up is the YSL primer
this is the toosha clot blur primer and
this is something I actually really love
it's a product that I feel like I
shouldn't but I do
it's super expensive it has gold glitter
in it it's a very silicone II smoothing
primer I think it just is great it
smells great even the gold glitter as
much as that seems like something that
would just look hideous or you know show
up on the skin I find I don't even
notice it so this is something that I am
potentially thinking about purchasing at
the end of this year I did get another
deluxe sized sample so if I still love
that sample after I finish it then I am
gonna think about purchasing this primer
because they like it that much oh my
gosh I forgot no I did get one more goal
met this is my eye shadow an illusion
from Urban Decay and I use this as a
highlighter and I hit pan oh yeah I
wanted to hit pan on this so bad I
brought this to Arizona with me just
like praying that I would have hand on
it and I did I'm so happy about this
this is one of my favorite highlighters
I've been using all year
it wasn't eyeshadow originally but
that's how I use it as a highlighter
it's beautiful I'm so happy I can't wait
to finish this product up I'll probably
finish it up in 2018 but that was just
such an exciting moment to see pan in
this product oh so exciting so I'm
really happy like for me to hit pan on
this product alone is such a success it
makes this project worth it something I
got really really close to finishing
this is the Revlon nearly naked
powder I believe this is being
discontinued as well but I just have the
tiniest ring around it I told you guys I
was gonna repress it didn't I'm gonna
repress it though let's see if I
actually do hopefully I do I do really
like this powder I think it's nice
I wouldn't like seek it out but it's not
like a bad powder I guess we'll just
bring up the lorac mega Pro this is
something that I don't know how I feel
about this palette anymore I think
something I'm learning is that I have a
lot of nostalgia for products and
sometimes that nostalgia can stop me
from really thinking about the product
and how it works in my life currently
how the product is performing currently
how it works for me and my collection
and this one is something that I have
very fond memories of it's the first
lorac Pro palette I have the 1 the 2 and
the 3 of the mega pros so I just have
really good memories with this and it's
the first one but really color wise I
find this is so dull and just I mean
some of these are really pretty but
overall it's just not something that
inspires me at all so I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna pass this on soon I might keep
it for a little bit and see no I think
I'm gonna pass this on I love the colors
white and cream they're great but I have
other creams I don't need to keep this
palette for a cream shadow so many
people would love this palette and think
it works so nice but I just I don't you
know it's not my color story anymore
I was looking back through my channel
we're getting a little rambling I'm so
sorry guys I was looking back through my
channel when I was at home because my
mom will sit and like watch my old
videos it's super sweet and kind of
weird but anyway we were looking back
through some of my videos and it was
really eye-opening to see what my makeup
looks like to see how I wore color and
how I wore my makeup and I'm just so
much more comfortable I feel like with
color whether it's on my lips whether
it's on my eyes I think I'm more skilled
in application and I just have kind of
flushed out my style when it comes to
makeup so this just isn't my style
anymore you know what I mean and so
that's something going into 2018 that I
want to be really aware of and just like
you know still it's so hard still
eliminating my attachment to makeup you
know it's just makeup you can repurchase
color similar to this if I really missed
it I can't get the same palette back but
I can get similar stuff it's not the end
of the world why am i holding onto this
when I don't want to use it even when it
was in a project yeah the ramble and
rant about that is over let's move on
this is something I was so close to
using this is the Sephora airbrush Pro
Foundation I will be finishing this off
in the new year and I'm excited to just
finish it I enjoy it I like the finish
on the skin the color on this is just
kinda it's just like a little too light
but the next one down is a little too
dark so color wise it's just not working
for me but I do like the way this looks
on the skin when I apply it with a
Beauty Blender it's just really pretty
you will be seeing that in an empty soon
I did have two more primers in this
project the first one is the hard candy
one now I don't have any more products
in the packaging I did move it into this
kind of container and something I'm
realizing with the hard candy I do
really like this primer I think it would
work for so many people but when I'm
really dry this doesn't moisturize I
need already moisturized skin really
nice skin and then put this on I feel
like I have just such a nice smooth base
but if not I find that this can kind of
dry out my skin almost or really
accentuate the dry patches which you
wouldn't expect from swatching it
because it seems like it would be very
smoothing but I don't know that's just
what I've learned through taking it to
Arizona and as I've been wearing it more
and more in the winter months that is
what I noticed so I would repurchase
that and I do suggest it but I'm
probably I'm gonna try the hydrating one
next time and then the other primer that
I had is the cover effects blurring
primer so close to being done but not
this is something that I'm just gonna
finish in 2018 I did my best it was just
too many primers I just needed different
things when I was in Arizona too so it's
like that is definitely not moisturizing
and my skin I'm telling you guys is so
dry when I'm in Arizona I didn't realize
how dry it was there because whoa I just
have dry patches everywhere I would
slather on moisturizer on my skin and
still have dry patches it was crazy I
have like dry patches all on my nose I'm
still recovering and yeah it was
definitely a weird situation to see how
dry it was I think everything that's
left for this project are lip products
first I want to talk about the sugar
rose a fresh lip balm
don't know where it is it's missing it's
gone I I don't know it was almost
finished so a minute I kind of count
that is done like if I find it I guess
I'll finish it up but it probably only
had like two uses on it so I don't know
where the heck that thing is that sucked
it was so close I would have really
liked to show you guys the progress on
that but next this one is the lip pencil
from by Terry and Rose contour and this
is something that I technically didn't
finish like I could still get more uses
out of this I'm just done with this this
is something that I've definitely been
forcing myself to use up for a long time
and I'm just over it it's so close to
being done they don't want to be
bothered with it so that's going in the
trash laughs this is the buxom lip
pencil in Sydney and I didn't finish it
I made some progress on this item I
don't think I'm ready to get rid of it
yet so I'm gonna continue to just work
on this hopefully you can get it done
before the halfway point of 2018 but
yeah those are all my items I'm so sorry
I don't have like pictures for you guys
that was something that I had intended
to do and then it got thrown off because
of storage and then I just kind of at
the end here crumbled away I am doing
some project pans going into 2018 I just
love having a project pan going out all
the time I think that project pans are a
great way to get to know yourself how
you use makeup how long it takes to use
up makeup and if you're finding that you
are buying too much stuff I realize that
everyone is comfortable with buying
different amounts of makeup and whatever
that is for you that's great but if
you're at the point where you kind of
feel like you're responding too much
it's like overwhelming if you're at that
stage I really think project panning is
a great way to focus your mind on doing
something different than buying new
releases and instead focusing on what
you have enjoying what you have being
grateful for what you have and you
really I mean you really do learn so
much about yourself and how you use
makeup and for me personally like I was
talking about I'm realizing that a lot
of these nostalgic products things that
are a little bit older even the Kat Von
D me vida loca
how much do I use those items I gotta
have a really great memory of the
items but am I using them why am i
saying they're so great are they really
staples in my collection and going into
2018 that's something I really want to
focus on
I want my collection she just always
reflects me and what I like and my
makeup style so that's what I want to
work on just to let you guys know here
at the end a couple other project pans
that I'm going to be working on I want
to do my project use it up which is a
monthly project pan I'm gonna start that
back up soon I also want to start a
year-long project pan up so probably
something like the finish eighteen and
twenty eighteen something that's going
to be focusing on larger items things
that are a bit harder to do where you
can really see progress over a large
span of time I'm gonna update you guys
on my video I did where I wanted to use
up products by the end of the year and
we're gonna go through those items see
if they're gone on my collection and if
they're not I'm gonna hopefully get rid
of those items I think that's it I'm
gonna have my year-long empties you guys
know that so lots of good project pan
stuff coming up I think that project
panning even as I get bigger as a
channel is just something that I love to
do I love using up make up I like
feeling like I got my money's worth out
of things and so for me project panning
is a way to do that and I think it's fun
it's like accomplishing goals and it's
like a fun time so anyway that's
everything thank you so much for
watching guys I hope you have an amazing
day if you don't know what project
panning is I'm just gonna leave a
playlist or a couple videos linked down
below so you can check it out cuz I know
I have a lot of new people so yeah thank
you so much for watching guys I'll see
you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
