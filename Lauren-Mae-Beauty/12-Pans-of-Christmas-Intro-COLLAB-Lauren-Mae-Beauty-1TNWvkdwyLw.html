learn thank you so so much for watching
today I am doing a new project pan intro
and I am so excited because this is a
massive collab it is absolutely shocking
how many people are in this collab so
I'm going to try to keep it brief here
at the beginning so we can get into the
products but I do want to take a moment
to just say how exciting this is this is
the 12 pans of Christmas project and if
you've been with my channel for a while
then you will remember that last year I
was a part of the 12 pans of Christmas
collab and it was with I don't even know
maybe like 15 ladies and we were all new
email' and we decided that we want to do
it again and something that I love about
the project pan and community is that it
is so inclusive I feel like we really do
try to support each other it doesn't
really necessarily matter how many
subscribers you have or whatever like
that doesn't matter we're all here to
have a good time to use that makeup to
get tips from each other to just have a
community and I think this project is a
perfect example of that Jacqueline is
the one who spearheaded this and she
spearheaded it last year she's
spearheading it this year and I want to
thank her so much for doing so much of
the administrative work on getting
everyone's names together and kind of
taking on that role I know it's a lot I
know it would be way too much for me and
way too overwhelming so I appreciate you
so much taking on that role and trying
to organize this project for us like I
said this is a huge collab and I've gone
back and forth debating if I should say
everyone's name if I shouldn't and I
have decided that I'm going to just list
everyone in the description box I'm
sorry I really wish I could give
everyone that like individual shadow
it's just gonna make this video
incredibly long and honestly I don't
want us to feel like we're at a
graduation so if you like project
panning if you want to support other
people who are project pinning
definitely please go check out all the
ladies listed down below that would be
absolutely amazing it's awesome because
there are so many different people in
this club there are gonna be people that
you know there are going to be people
that you don't know and I think it's
just a fun way for us to all come
together during the holidays use some
products out but just have a good time
have some fun and hopefully you'll find
some new project panners or I'm just
YouTube channels that you can watch and
enjoy
so with that there will
so be a playlist with all of our videos
so that might be an easier way for you
to get introduced to all the different
channels and watch our videos so that
will also be down below there are 50
people here on YouTube including myself
who are doing this collab officially
like where they've given jacqueline them
emails and all of that so that is just
absolutely insane and then on top of
that there are 11 people on Instagram so
I'm gonna leave all the people on
Instagram definitely go check out their
instagrams give them support other you
know using up their products again this
project just kind of like warms my heart
and I'm I'm just really happy to be a
part of it again I think this is just a
fun one and other than that let's get
into the products and just this project
in general so twelve pans of Christmas
we have pretty loose rules I'm totally
not one for like having a ton of rules
when it comes to project panning like
it's hard enough to use up a blush and
all this crap sometimes like I don't
need all these rules so we did try to
theme this one this year though and a
lot of people are going to be picking
out products that correlate with a
Christmas movie so you will be saying
that I feel bad I'm not a Grinch I
promise I will not be doing that part I
was just looking through my collection
and I feel like twelve items is already
a lot of products to use up especially
in a two month period because this
project will be going from November 1st
until the end of the year it's just kind
of not a lot of time so I really like to
use my last project of the year as like
a clean up like trying to like get those
last couple items out of my collection
and get the last little stragglers out
so that is what I'm using this project
as I just wouldn't have been able to
finish a lot of things if I had to stay
within the confines of picking items
that correlated to movies so I'm excited
to see what other people's choices are
with them doing that with the movies and
that's something that I think is so
interesting and cool too about project
panning is that everyone has different
goals some people just want to get more
use out of things they don't necessarily
want to use things up some people are
just trying to hit pan I actually did
pick more than 12 I think it picked
about 15 items because I'm hoping that
within those
tene I can actually hit my goal on
twelve of them I think that's enough of
a freaking intro right let's get in to
the items the first item is going to be
no surprise to some of you who have
followed my channel this is my Revlon
nearly naked powder I know this was just
an I finished third time about Halloween
so you guys saw it literally yesterday
but I do want to finish this up so I
thought this would be a good one to
throw in here it'll keep me focused on
it and I'm pretty dang close so this one
should not be a problem and I think in
two months I can definitely use it up
keeping with face products this is my
NARS creamy what it's called it's the
radiant cream compact foundation I have
mine in light - Mont Blanc and I would
like to use this up I don't know how
possible that's gonna be it doesn't look
like a lot and I have hit pan but I feel
like a little bit of this goes a long
way so I would like to try to finish
this up if I can this isn't an old item
I just feel like I could use it up so
why not like get it out and focus on
other things I do have another
foundation I'm throwing in here this is
the Sephora perfection mist
airbrush foundation and i have it in
the-- shade oh wow
it's actually already expired didn't
know that i'm still gonna use it this is
in the shade fair and i'm really close i
think i'm like down to here so I
definitely think I can finish this one
up I just want to get it out and now
that I know it's expired I definitely
want to get this used up by the end of
the year it's crazy because this didn't
even last me a year then I bought this
last year at Christmas time when I was
in Arizona and it expired August 25th of
2017 like that's not even a year I
wonder how old this was sitting in the
store so those are my first three
products my next three products are
actually all primers I have a lot of
like almost used up primers so I thought
I would throw them in the first one here
is the hard candy sheer envy primer in
the shine free version I am so close on
this like this probably has a week's
worth of use but I feel like since it's
hard to get it out of the container
sometimes when I'm just getting ready in
the morning really fast I don't want to
like mess around with like digging it
out of this so
I want to put this in the project I know
I'll be able to use it up and I know
that it'll like force me to take the
time with this and get every last drop
out I love this primer I think it's
really nice I would definitely
repurchase so I just want to use it
although the next one is SuperDuper
close as well this is the YSL Touche
Claud blur primer it's funny because I
didn't like this when I first used it
and now I really like it
it has like gold glitter in it and I
still like it the texture of this is
just so nice I love the way it Prime's
my skin like there's a part of me that's
tempted to purchase this like I would be
so happy if this came on the octoly
store I would like apply for it
immediately like I really really do like
it so I want to use it up and enjoy it
I'm gonna scrape every last little drop
out of this but I do want this done that
one's like another one of those like
that's hard to get out so I definitely
need this push to like get every last
drop
and my last primer here is just a deluxe
sized sample and this is the cover
effects blurring primer I did really
like this when I was first using it but
I find that it just kind of dries I skim
out a tiny little bit so I'm gonna try
to use it up I don't know if those were
just like weird days or what I did like
it though so we'll see this isn't a lot
to go through so I definitely think I'll
have a firm opinion of what I think
about this by the end of this project I
have quite a few lip products that I'm
actually throwing in here which is rare
for me I'm not someone that goes through
lip products very fast I'm not good at
it so I feel like I tend to not really
like put them in the project but I am
going to be adventurous and puts them in
here that I really want to use up before
the end of the year rolls around because
if not I'll probably declutter them if I
don't use them the first one is this
tiny little lip pencil this is from by
Thierry and this has been in previous
project pans I just want to finish it up
it's so so tiny it's just like you know
not quite finished so I don't feel like
you know satisfied with it so I just
want to force myself to use this up I
don't think it'll be a problem like it
shouldn't be because there's barely any
left but we'll see one of the other lip
products is this fresh sugar rose a
tinted lip balm I love this stuff you
guys already know that because you've
seen my VIP Rouge like sale
recommendations but anyway that's all I
have left
it's not a lot I do like this colored
one I think it gives a nice
to the lips it's something that's like
effortless and gives a little bit of
color in life without feeling too heavy
so this shouldn't be hard to go through
and the last lip product and probably
the one that's going to be the hardest
to use up is the buxom lip crayon in
Sydney I do really like this color but
it's just quite nude this is what it
looks like and it's nice I just don't
use lip products very often so that is
how much I have to use up it's not a lot
definitely think it's possible and I
really don't want this to go to waste
since I really do like this lip crayon
formula I think this is the last product
that I want to actually like use up all
the way this is an eyeliner from urban
decay in the color stash this has been
in a previous project this year so I
have used up quite a bit of it and this
is just a green eyeliner I'm basically
just gonna use this to tightline how I
normally use eyeliners and I'd like to
just get it gone this is my last urban
decay eyeliner in my collection so it's
a little bit older and I want to get it
out now everything else that I have to
show my goal is just hit pan on these
items it's not too entirely use it up I
don't think that would be possible at
home with some of these so the first one
here is an eye shadow from urban decay
this is the color illusion and it was in
The Wizard of Oz like limited edition
palette I have taken it out and put it
in a single form and I use this as a
highlighter I love it as a highlighter
it's so so pretty and I would like to
pan on it I just would like to see some
love in it and I'm kind of excited
because this is something I always want
to reach for but sometimes if I'm
panning something else that I'm using as
a highlighter I feel like I can't use
this so I'm excited to actually use this
and it's like I'm supposed to be using
it so that will be fun the next item is
a blush from girl lactic this is the
color Milan and it's absolutely
beautiful I think this is a nice it fall
shade it's like a dusty mauve pretty
cool toned almost like purpley color
this is an older blush in my collection
and I'm honestly using this project as a
way to decide if I want to keep this
blush or not I used to love this blush a
nice use it all the time and I just have
it in a long time so I want to see if I
still love it if it's still something
that works in my collection and I think
this project is a great way to like get
lots and lots of use out of it and see
if
something I can wear everyday so we'll
see how this one does in the project
next I have a pallet and I'm only
focusing on one product within this
pallet and that is going to be the
Laguna bronzer I would love to hit pan
on this I'm honestly just trying to use
up this bronzer and then I think I'm
going to declutter the rest of the
pallet if I could use this up I feel
like I could get my money's worth out of
this entire product and I do like the
Laguna bronzer so I would love to hit
pan on that and then last I have a huge
palette here this is the lorac mega Pro
palette and this is the first one that
ever came out and my goal is just a hit
pan on as many eyeshadows in here as
possible
I first sure would like to hit pan on
too I'm not picking which ones I'm gonna
hit pan on because I don't know what I'm
gonna be feeling but if I had to guess I
would say I'm probably gonna hit pan on
the cream I might hit pan on one of
these lighter shades I might hit pan on
white and then I think some of these
crease colors would be easy to hit pan
on so I'm just gonna focus I'm using
this palette as much as possible this
month really getting some use out of it
I already have pan on espresso in the
corner this is something that I keep in
my makeup kit actually and I think it's
time to pull it out of there I don't use
it a ton in my kit anyway so I think
this might even be what I'm gonna pan
next year
for the whole year we'll see it's just
getting a little bit old and I really
need to either get some good use out of
this or pass it on so those are all my
items guys I really hope you enjoyed
this intro I hope you guys go check out
everyone else in this project and I just
feel really lucky to be included in this
and I'm excited to see everyone else's
projects and updates I think this is
going to be a very motivating two months
for everyone to use up their items which
I think will be really nice to kind of
combat all the like buying and gifts and
all of that you know what I mean it's a
nice balance so that is everything thank
you so so much for watching guys and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
