Lauren I am so so super excited about
this video today this is a project pan
collab video and this is going to be the
12 pans of Christmas there are a ton of
other women here on YouTube we are all
getting together and we are trying to
pan some products before the end of the
year we're starting November 1st and
we're going until like Christmas / the
end of the year like it's basically just
like a big blowout how much can we get
done and then we try to name it like a
cute little name so yeah you know we did
what we could
Jacqueline or Fort Worth famous here but
now not Fort Worth famous and her
channel is now named Jacqueline Levine I
believe is how you pronounce it she
contacted me and was like let's do a
project pan and I was like yeah I'm so
excited that'd be great one of the
biggest goal she want to do is just
reach out to as many people as we could
and just get a bunch of people together
to do a collab for the holidays for the
end of the year to move some stuff out
and to just like create a sense of
community in the project pan community
so something I love so much about the
project and community is that I feel
like there are so many people in here
whether you have a large channel or a
small channel like we all watch each
other's videos and I just really like
that about this so this collab was just
as like friends to do some just to move
some products out and to be in a car
together so I'm so excited to be doing
this video with all these lovely ladies
I'm going to list them all one by one
now so prepared but I just want to give
everyone that shout out in that time
some of these people I don't know and
I'm excited to get to know and some of
these people I know and watch and
comment on my videos and stuff so that
being said let's get into all the people
in the project pan so obviously first is
Jacqueline here you guys probably all
know her next we have Jen from glam
mom's Adriana Pia Mia I think is it with
an MP Mia or Pina
eyes on Alison Jamie or JME jinx here on
YouTube Rita B Courtney cave auntie May
LS you guys all know LS Mary or Kingston
Ora McGuire Lydia or that lady it's so
hard to say her name she says at the
beginning of her videos but it's so hard
so I'm so sorry that I butchered that
seven six to three kala and then we also
have someone collaborating with us but
on Instagram and that is Erin Kohl
underscore beauty I will have that also
linked down below so I really hope that
I said everyone's name because I missed
some last time so do refilm this portion
so I'm so sorry I forgot your names but
I'm pretty sure got everyone Oh tell me
if I didn't so I can like fix it I'm so
super excited please go show those
ladies some love and subscribe to them
I'm super excited to be doing this club
and to be just all together as one on
this on this thing
enough gushing about that let's move on
to some products actually pitch so for
the rules on this super lacks we were
just like pick 12 things doesn't matter
the samples doesn't matter if they're
makeup or if they're skin care like just
12 things you want to push out and you
can have your own rules like if you just
wanna hit pan or whatever like it wasn't
about that it was just about just
forming community and being friends huh
I'm so sorry I feel like so rambling but
I'm just it's just an exciting video
collabing is super fun and it's
definitely not a strong point or strong
suit for me to like I'm not someone who
just like reaches out to people so it
feels good anyway first thing I want to
try to hit pan on is the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer I was sent this
from autumn here on YouTube I will leave
her link down below as well I love it
thank you so much autumn for sending
this to me I'm sorry you didn't like it
but I liked it so it worked out I just
want to hit pan on this I use this every
single day so I'm just gonna continue to
use it every day but I would really love
to see some pan another kind of I think
a biggie I don't know this is makeup
Forever's Ultra HD foundation and I have
the shade 117 I am right here on it now
so I don't have a ton left this is not
my favorite foundation I'm wearing it
right now it's pretty light coverage I
think for HD in the movies it totally
makes sense if you want someone to just
look like they're not wearing makeup or
to look like skin but if I have any
at all or anything that's more than just
redness it just doesn't do it for me so
it's not my favorite but since we're
going into winter
I shouldn't be as oily so hopefully it
won't break down and be as much of a
mess on me this is my Smashbox contour
kit and I only have one shade left and I
don't have a lot left but this is the
contour color I would like to finish
this up and just get it gone because
then I can just get rid of this whole
palette it's the only thing I have left
it's not a lot of product so I
definitely think I can do it and it
would just feel good to get like a whole
big palette out that would be awesome I
have quite a few primers in here so the
first one is the Becca ever matte
poreless priming Perfector Perfector
it's so hard for me to talk with this
liquid lipstick on I don't really know
why people like this color from Kat Von
D the damaged color it takes forever to
layer up I don't know man anyway this is
something I wanted to use it for the
year so I just want to try to finish
this up I'm not sure if I'm gonna be
able to I've been using it everyday for
the last like week or two so I just want
to try in two months to get it gone it's
not my favorite but I feel like again
with winter coming seriously I think of
Game of Thrones every time but with my
skin just being less oily and less like
likely to get oily I feel like it will
hopefully work out the other primers I'm
counting as one item because they are
both pretty small and I'm gonna use them
in conjunction with the Becca one this
first one is the Revlon beyond natural
smoothing primer it's really similar to
the maybelline baby skin or this
smashbox like photo finish i don't know
if it's like discontinued i got it off
all cosmetics wholesale like forever ago
and i just want to finish it up a Milnes
done and then i'm rolling over the pur
cosmetics illuminating primer that I had
in my finish 13 by Halloween this one's
it give me product but I don't give a
this is the Boyne concealer from Benefit
and I don't even know if you can see but
there's just some product around the
edges I just want to get this gone and
this is the push to make me use this
I mostly use this to clean up like
underneath my brow or around my lip or
if I have like a really big pimple like
this one I'll use it to cover that but I
just want to use this up so even if I
have to just like use it as a foundation
one day I don't give up I just want it
gone on my collection for anything that
is like a stick form I will mark it on
piece of paper later but this is a brow
pencil from the brand fairy girl and
it's from ebay this is like 75 cents
I'll leave everything link down below if
you want it I like this it's all I have
in my brows today so I mean I can
obviously get a pretty dang good brow
with this
I just prefer I think the ELF pencil
better although I like the shape of this
better I wish the ELF pencil came in
this shape but um anyway I really enjoy
this and I just want to get it gone
because I have the backups of the elf
and I find that I'm just reaching for
that over this and I don't want this
just sitting this is the hard candy
highlight and contour stick I mostly
want to try to use up the contour side
this actually broke off on me
from the base so that's kind of
irritating it's not that expensive I do
like this product I have a first
impression on it I'll leave it link down
below it is a really nice color for like
the temples and the contour of your like
cheekbones I don't like using it on the
jawline because I just feel like I can't
get a good blend and it just looks a
little dirty so I mostly use it for
those areas and I want to use up the
contour side I'm also going to be
working on the highlights side so if I
could get this done that'd be awesome
I'm wearing it today it's okay I'm
mostly just like the contour but I
thought might as well try to move this
out I chose one perfume type of item
this is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana
white perfume and it's a rollerball I'm
starting at the second black line there
I like this perfume I also have it in a
full-size like sprayer so I definitely
need to get this gone so I could start
working on that it's an OK scent I feel
like I bought into the hype of everyone
else loving it and although it's a scent
that I don't mind it's definitely not
one of my favorites maybe it'll grow on
me though I have this tiny little mini
of the Makeup Forever HD powder this is
kind of an extra item I have 13 items
technically well technically 14 if you
count the two primers but I just didn't
throwing this in here because I want to
finish it up there's barely any powder
in there it's like not even half full
it's just like what the heck wasting
away in my collection I can't put that
in my kit like what so I just want to
use that up this is the tarte
lipsurgence in the color exposed I
really love this love Heatherette also
really likes it and look at that that's
all I have left
definitely doable this item I lost
and it was in my kit but I lost it when
I was in school and it was a part of my
like seven spring items I don't know it
was a part of a different project
thought I lost it we found it so I'd
like to actually finish it this comes in
different packaging now and I definitely
think I might repurchase it once I
finished this it's really nice the color
is really beautiful and I really do like
the formula of these two more items I
have a rollover item again this is the
Batarian lip liner from by Terry what
this is the by Terry lip pencil in Rose
contour I really like this I don't
really like it I go back and forth again
I made a lot of progress on it in my
last project so I definitely feel like I
can use it up by the end of this one and
last I have another eyeliner in here I
did so well with the last eyeliner I
thought I would just throw in this one
this is Urban Decay's 1999 this is a
really pretty kind of like rosy purple
color I like it I wouldn't repurchase it
but I do want to enjoy it and use it up
and get another eyeliner out so those
are all of my items I really hope you
guys enjoy this video again please go
say hi to everyone else in this project
I would really appreciate it and I know
they would too
we're really excited and if you want to
join in on this project you weren't
contacted or you want to join in join in
like please join in and we would love to
have you a part of it and using up some
stuff so that's everything I hope you
