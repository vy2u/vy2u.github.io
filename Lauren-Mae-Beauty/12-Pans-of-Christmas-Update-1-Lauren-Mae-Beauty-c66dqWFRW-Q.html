Lauren all it feels so good to talk to
you guys I have been away I was in
Arizona for a while you would know that
if you followed me on Instagram I'll
leave a link down below it's always
there if you want to follow me I usually
post things like my work and just more
up-to-date stuff than on YouTube because
I do pre film so it just feels like I
haven't talked to you guys in a while
this is going to be the twelve pans of
Christmas update number one which there
will only be one update this is in
collaboration with as so many other
woman here on YouTube I was so excited
to be a part of this thank you so much
Jacqueline for initially emailing me and
I'm getting this whole thing started
everyone will be listed down below
definitely check them out and I wanted
to say thank you so much to everyone
who's joined in so amazing everyone on
Instagram everyone on YouTube I know
Jacqueline is kind of keeping that
playlist going so we are trying to keep
that playlist like active with a bunch
of different people who are joining so
let's just get into the products they
have some successes some like okay is it
some failures but we'll get into it as
we go I'm gonna start off with the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and my
goal is just to hit pan on this and I
did I hit pan on this right after
filming that video this has just been me
working on it I'm just gonna continue
using it it's my bronzer that I use
every day and I really love it so lots
of pain and lots of progress on this one
something I didn't think I'd have a
problem finishing up was the little
makeup forever mini this is their HD
powder I ended up taking the stopper out
and everything
I enjoyed this powder it's not very
brightening like since it is translucent
but I find that this keeps me so mad I
don't know if it was because I was in
Arizona or this powder or the
combination but my skin over there was
like not oily at all it was the weirdest
feeling like I almost felt like my skin
needed so much moisture this just kept
me matte all day I didn't have to touch
up I didn't feel like I needed to touch
up I didn't feel like an oil slick
it was odd it was so weird but I did
enjoy this and do have a bigger size and
I'm gonna try using it here to see if
the results are the same work it was
more the conditions of Arizona that kept
me so mad
something that surprised me was the Make
Up For Ever foundation I ended up
finishing this up so I started in this
project at the first line and then this
is where I'm at but I cannot squeeze
anything else out I used it today it
took me forever to keep squeezing and
squeezing and squeezing the pump I got
enough to do my face but there's really
not enough product in here I don't have
time to sit there for 20 minutes to pump
this to maybe get enough for my face so
if you guys know how to open this let me
know other than that this is done I do
have a backup of this item from
generation Beauty so you will be seeing
it again just not this exact bottle
I really enjoyed mixing this with the
enabling better skin together those two
just look really nice I will be using
those two together probably any time I
wear it although I am wearing it alone
today and I think it looks ok I feel
like my hair looks kind of scary today I
tried to be cute with like the top knot
but I just feel like it looks so thin
and scraggly so I'm sorry and there's
more thing that I finished this is the
Boyne concealer from Benefit and I just
ended up using this I think in two
different times and I just used it all
over my face as a foundation I don't
enjoy this I would never repurchase this
I just need it to finally get it done
and it is done now we're gonna move into
progress so for my Smashbox contour kit
I ended up repressing it but then forgot
about it so it's not actually pressed
down it's just mashed up I am using it
every day so I think there is potential
to use it up before the end of the year
that's kind of where I'm going just to
give myself a couple more days but I
don't know I definitely will have to use
it every single day so hopefully I can
get this one done I had 3 primers in
here but two of them counted as one item
this is the Revlon beyond natural
smoothing primer I've used this a couple
times it really doesn't have that much
left in it I'm not gonna be cutting this
open so I just need to use it until I
can't squeeze anything out so hopefully
like 4 or 5 more uses I just need to
actually use it and then this is the
pure little mini I started the project
up here and I'm down barely anything I
thought this would be so easy to go
through but you really don't need a lot
of it and also I feel like before we
went to Arizona my skin just felt too
oily to be using this for long periods
of time but we are going back to Arizona
in the end of December
through the end of the year so I'm gonna
bring this there and I think that's what
I'm gonna use it up because my school
was just so dry and I was thinking in my
head like I should have brought that
primer but I didn't bring it cuz I
didn't think I'd use it and I was trying
to cut down and it was like the one time
I actually could use this and make a lot
of progress and the other primer is the
Becca ever matte and I started up here I
don't know if you can see the line but
now I'm down here that's really not the
progress from this whole time this is
where I started at the beginning of the
year and I just kind of kept it because
you couldn't really tell any difference
this you just need the smallest amount
of this it just lasts forever there's no
way I'm gonna finish this up but I am
using it every single day it's like my
base primer I am enjoying it a lot more
I don't know if it's because it's winter
time and there's just not as much Sun
and sweat and all of that to make this
kind of breakdown on my skin but I have
been enjoying it so I'm just going to
continue using this until I use it up
but I don't think that will be within
this project I did not mark this for the
roller ball sorry guys but I started up
here this is the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana and I am down to here so I
definitely think I can finish this up I
made about half of the progress or used
up half of this bottle it's funny
because Jen on her video mentioned that
her rollerball has like nasties in it
and mine also does too I think it's like
the makeup and stuff that is on your
skin as you roll it gets into the
product mine still smells fine but it's
definitely kind of grody it's like
roller balls are the equivalent of clear
brow gel in a clear tube or something
but anyway I am definitely confident on
this one I think I can finish it up this
is my tarte lipsurgence
and i'm gonna say right now that i was a
bad project panner and i didn't mark a
lot of the lines that's how much I have
left it's essentially the same amount as
before I'm wearing it today I haven't
been wearing it a ton but I am gonna be
on set from the first until the 8th well
essentially the first until the 12th
I'll be working every day and this is
just a really easy lip product so I'm
gonna try my best to work through this
product in that time frame and just
focus on it and use it then so I do
think I'll be able to finish it up I
guess
I made any progress in the first half
this is my brow pencil this is from eBay
and I don't have much left let me see
that's all I have
I think it's lower than last time
because I have been using this I
definitely need to make sure I'm using
this every day I was using that YBF
pencil for a little bit and then I was
like oh crap I should probably use this
it's in a project so I'm gonna be
working on this all of December and I
think I can't finish it up there are
three of our products for me to show you
guys the next one is the highlighting
and contouring stick and this is from
hard candy I'm mostly focusing on the
contour side again I don't have lines
for you but mine is like mangled because
I think it broke off again I just have
issues when it comes to rolling crap up
so I'm sorry that's what it looks like
inside so definitely some good progress
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to use
this up by the end of the year I have
not been using this every single day
so we'll see I'm gonna try really hard
to use this as often as I possibly can
but again I am gonna be on set so I know
I have really early call times and I
don't have time to cream contour my face
at 4:00 in the morning so yeah we will
see how this goes but I don't think I'll
finish it up and I'm just giving up on
the highlights side I might just finish
that next year I don't really like it as
much as the contour and I'm not gonna
fuss over it it's gonna be hard enough
just use the contour up right now and
the last two items are my liner so this
is the urban decay $19.99 liner I don't
have reference of where I was last time
I have not been using this everyday
which is not my normal style I usually
use the same liner every day until it's
gone but I've just been enjoying
something a little bit darker than this
so I really just need to focus in on
this and actually use it up and you know
not switch around and I'll definitely
see progress I know it seems like a lot
of pencil but I think I could finish
this if I used it everyday these go so
fast for me last this is my lip liner
it's so close it's so close that's all I
have left so I think I can finish this
up I just need to use it basically every
day it's getting really close to where I
can't sharpen it so as soon as that
happens it'll be done I also sharpen it
pretty sharp because I wanted a really
crisp line the
just like broke off so I know this is
getting like just dried out it needs to
go so I really think I can finish this
up it'll just take my effort I really
need to focus I hope you guys enjoyed
this video on this update check out
everyone else he's doing the project I
know they would love your support and
definitely go cheer them on I'm gonna be
filming so many videos after this
because again I'm working so much
basically until we leave again for
Arizona and I just don't know if I'm
gonna have time I thought I'd have two
days off in between but I just
potentially got booked for those so yeah
it's a good thing to be busy but I just
need to film a lot today and this I work
I start tomorrow
it's the 30th it's not like I'm pre
filming this so I need to like get this
stuff edited anyway enough rambling at
the end here I will see you guys in my
next videos I hope you're having a
wonderful day and um yeah I'll see you
I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
