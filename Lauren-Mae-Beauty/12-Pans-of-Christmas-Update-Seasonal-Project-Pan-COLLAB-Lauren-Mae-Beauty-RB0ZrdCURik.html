Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing an update for the top
pans of Christmas this is a massive
project pan collaboration going on with
so many people in the project panning
community as well as just like a ton of
youtubers so I'm gonna leave the
playlist link down below there are also
people joining us on Instagram so I will
leave all of their handles linked down
below too so you guys can check them out
I know it would mean the world to
everyone if you went and checked out
their videos you can hopefully get some
inspiration to use up some of your
products as well as find some new
youtubers to watch so yeah I think
that's it for the intro I want to get
into my products I know I'm like a day
late on this which I hate but it just
worked out with my schedule
so I'm excited as I was like pulling
these products cuz in my head I'm like
I'm doing so great on this project like
I have so many amazing like items that
I've used up or has some good progress
on and as I'm like getting them I'm like
well I guess that well no oh well maybe
it's just a couple of items but um I'm
excited to show you guys where I'm at
and finish this out strong we have a
month left I'm gonna be giving you guys
an update at the end of the year or
around the end of the year so I am
excited to show you guys that and
hopefully we can get some of these
things used up so I'm gonna start off
with the biggest success and then move
on from there I do have to say though I
told you guys I was gonna take pictures
and I did and then I deleted them off my
phone because I had no like space like I
can't even update my apps even though I
don't even have a lot of stuff on my
phone I don't know what the heck is up
with that but I need stuff for like
taking pictures on set and all that so I
deleted them without putting them on the
computer so I'm so sorry about that but
yeah the things that I have progress on
it's kind of like big progress so I
think it'll work out but the first thing
here is my first used-up item this is
the this is the NARS creamy concealer
around the edges but I was not expecting
to finish this up especially not in the
first update like I hoped I could do it
over the course of the entire project
and the fact that it's already gone
makes me so happy I did enjoy this
product like I'm not happy it's gone
because I hate
but it just you know feels so good to
use up a product this is a really nice
cream foundation I feel like they're
just continuing it or something because
it is so hard to find this shade which
is Mont Blanc on the website it's not on
sephora's website you can only get it
off of the NARS website and even then I
believe they're sold out of this shade
so I don't know what's going on with
that but I did enjoy this I'm not sure
if I would repurchase it only because I
think I want to try other things out but
I do recommend it if someone was like to
ask me about it I think it's a great
foundation I think the other biggest
success that I have is in my lorac mega
Pro palette my goal is to hit pan on at
least two eyeshadows in here and just
kind of like get a lot of use out of
this palette and I was able to hit pan
on cream so I'm really happy about that
cream is not that hard of a shadow to
hit pan on but still it takes time
dedication and use to actually do that
so I'm very happy with that I did get a
lot of use out of these colors here I
have been mixing in some of the white
shade to hopefully hit pan on that and
then espresso I already had panin so I
still have to hit pan on one shadow but
I'm very happy to at least hit half of
my goal in this I had mentioned in my
intro video that I might make this my
pan that palette for 2018 and with using
this more and more I don't think so I am
I don't know if I'm gonna do a pan that
palette next year I think it would be
better for me to do like a one month one
palette because I've brought in so many
palettes recently and those just get me
so excited and then I'm looking at older
palettes and just kind of like like you
know the shades in here are they're not
bad there's nothing wrong with them I
just I don't know this palette doesn't
inspire me it's so funny and so weird
how you know when this first came out I
was so excited I thought it had so many
great colors in it and I don't know if
it's with time and you're just used to
these shades or as like the trends
change or your style changes it just
doesn't do as much for me so I don't
know I'm not like getting rid of it at
the moment but those are just some
thoughts on that and really the only
other thing that I have like I think
really good progress on is my sugar rosy
lip balm from fresh I am almost done
with this I've been using this at night
honestly even though it's tinted and
that's it
like I'm not gonna dig in there and I
think within a week I can definitely use
that up I'm so happy about that because
I really do love the Rose a1 and the
original formula of these fresh sugar
lip balms they're so great but I just I
just haven't been using this and you
guys know lip products are difficult for
me so I'm glad to be actually using this
up before it goes bad and before I was
gonna get rid of it so really happy
about the progress on that one
okay now moving into items that I maybe
don't have much progress on or whatnot
so these are just in no particular order
although I do want to talk about some
items I've changed my mind about first
in my intro I had mentioned that I put
in more than 12 items that way if I
didn't like finish something I just had
a better chance of actually finishing up
twelve and some of these items I think
I'm just done with like I think
something about project panning and as I
try to have a better relationship with
makeup and not be on either extreme
where I'm like buying a ton of makeup
you know with you know impulse buying
and just buying everything and spending
way too much money I also don't want to
like pan things I hate I want to enjoy
makeup and I just don't want it to have
a hold on me either way whether it's
Japan like a madwoman or to buy like a
madwoman I don't want any of that I just
want to enjoy the things I enjoy have an
enthusiastic relationship with it but I
could take it or leave it it doesn't own
me anyway we're talking about a lot of
stuff in this video my goodness okay so
anyway the NARS palette this is the
virtual domination palette I believe
this came out in 2015 holiday 2015 may
be holiday 2014 yeah I think holiday
2014 my goal is to hit pan in the
bronzer in here which is the classic
Laguna I already knew I didn't want to
do anything with these colors I just I
don't feel any passion toward them the
highlighter super glittery the blush
colors I could take like I could leave
on I don't care about them and I use
this and it's fine I just why not pass
this on to someone who can enjoy the
whole palette why hit pan just to do it
like I'd rather be using bronzers in my
collection that I actually enjoy like my
butter bronzer I really like the bronze
goddess bronzer from Estee Lauder
just got a new bronzer from number seven
beauty that I want to try out so I would
rather just pass this on so this is
gonna go in my declutter pile I'm gonna
be showing you guys some declutter items
pretty soon because when I go back to
Arizona I want to bring all the items
that I don't want in my collection and I
give them out to friends and family and
whoever is near me I'm like look through
this bag you can have whatever you want
that's kind of how I get rid of my
makeup like I don't sell it or anything
so um yeah I'm going to put this in fact
bucket so you'll see that in that video
but you know I think that is just like
the best decision for me something I
don't have to like try to use it up I
can enjoy the bronzers I have it's a
win-win for everyone in every situation
except for the original Lauren has spent
the money on it but that's in the past
there's nothing we can do about it
alright anyway the next item this is the
girl acta crush in Milan now this is
something that I used to love it was one
of my favorite blush colors I used it
all the time it's matte the formula is
so creamy and soft it looks beautiful on
the skin and I put this in here because
I really wanted to see if this was
something I still loved now something
with like YouTube and all these things I
think it's like we say we love all these
items because we didn't at one point we
loved the Naked palette we loved all
these products but as things come out as
our tastes change in makeup as formulas
get better it's like those products
might not be loves anymore I think that
if a lot of people actually went back
and revisited their Naked palette I
think they'd be surprised by their
thoughts on it maybe they still love it
but I think a lot of people would be I
don't know at least not as in love with
it so anyway that's why I put this in
here I wanted to get some use out of it
and make sure it was something I still
really liked because it was hard to
declutter because I knew I'd liked it at
one point but I also knew like I haven't
been reaching for that ever so I did
wear this quite a bit I would say a good
7 times and I just don't love it on my
skin anymore
I found that I always wanted to reach
for other blushes it felt like a chore
to use this one and I don't want that so
I am going to also be passing this on
and getting it out of my collection so I
think it has inspired me to make a video
about like products I've changed my mind
on because
yeah I definitely changed my mind on a
few things and I thought it would be a
fun video to put those all in one video
all right I'm gonna try to keep it like
frickin tight lift let's go Lauren cuz
this is getting really long and we
haven't shown like half of the stuff I
did throw another foundation in here
this is the Sephora perfection mist
airbrush foundation this was in my
favorites video
really like this product wish it hadn't
expired already I would definitely check
that out if you're gonna purchase this
product make sure the expiration date
actually has at least a year on it my
goodness I love the way this looks on
the skin the color range isn't that
great but I am almost done with this so
I've been using it I've in this state of
like loving it so it all works out
definitely think I'll have this finished
by the end of the product project oh can
you tell this is the fourth video I'm
filming today if I can moving on the
next product here is from Revlon this is
the Revlon nearly naked powder I am so
so close guys definitely some really
good progress I really need to just like
pull this all out crush it up put some
alcohol in it and repress it so I can
use it easier it's kind of a chore to
use it right now which always is
difficult for me to actually want to use
it and then I want to reach for other
things so I know if I do that I'll be
able to use this up in no time
definitely think I will have this done
by the end of the project I threw in
like a million primers in here because
they're all like on their last legs and
I really wish I had sat one down and
focused on it and then moved on to the
next one once that was finished but I
haven't I find that all of these primers
are something that I enjoy but I use
them for different reasons and with
different foundations so the hard candy
primer here I mean it's seriously so
close to being done I even used like
this roller thing to like push
everything out and I'm just I'm not
giving up on it until like the last you
know bit finally comes out here so this
probably has like a week and a half of
like everyday use on it I have the cover
FX blurring primer here it's just a mini
sample and again doesn't have that that
much in here right I can't imagine this
lasting me too much longer but I want to
try to finish that up and then the last
one in here is from why
and this one is such a great primer
again barely anything left I just need
to what I need to do with this is just
scrape everything out put it in a little
jar that's easy to use and then I think
I would be like more apt to use this but
because it's difficult to get out I just
like kind of it's easier to squeeze
something out than like scrape and like
put something else in here to get stuff
out so I'm so close on all of those I
definitely think I can finish up two of
them by the end of the project so
hopefully I can get you know going on
that and if I just focus on one at a
time I think it'll be easier to actually
use them up I threw in this Urban Decay
eyeshadow this is in the shade illusion
from the Glinda the Good Witch palette I
use this as a highlighter you guys know
that and I've been using this almost
every single day I've been making a lot
of progress on it but I don't know if
I'm gonna hit pan on it that's my goal
I definitely see some use on this
product but it's like even across so I
don't know if I'm actually gonna hit pan
or anything I would be very happy and
surprised if I hit pan but I'm very
happy with the progress that I've made
on it and you know I can't really be
using it more than I already have been
so I feel great about that product I
think I have three things left to talk
about so we'll just move on to the lip
products this is the lip liner in Rose
contour from by Terry I have sharpened
this once I was using this a lot more at
the beginning right after I'd film my
intro and picked these products but I
kind of just like forgot about it
haven't been using it so I want to
continue to use that I think that I
really can only get like one more sharp
and out of it so if I just don't be a
slacker I think I can definitely use
that up and then this one the buxom
Sydney lip pencil I really like this
product but I just haven't been using it
I used it again at the beginning and
then just kind of forgot about it so
that's all I have left if I really just
took the time to use this and put it on
my lips every single day I think I could
get some really good progress if not use
it up I just actually have to use it
like actually have to remember that this
is in the project that I'm trying to use
it up I really do want to use this up by
the end of the year though because I
have this when I moved to California
with me and
it's just getting old I mean nothing has
changed on it but I don't know I just
want to like get it gone it's just an
older thing in my collection but because
I really do like the formula I it's
harder for me to let go of it and the
last item I believe is this eyeliner
from Urban Decay this is in the color
stash
I have sharpened this one also once and
I'm using it I used it today honestly I
have been like a no eyeliner girl I
haven't even been using eyeliner because
if I'm waking up super early in the
morning like I mentioned I think I
mentioned this in my intro I just don't
want the gunk on my eyes like my eyes
are already like wanting to close and go
back to sleep and like you know they
don't want to be up and so putting gunk
in them is just like I don't know I feel
like I'm spraying water on a I don't
even know what where I was going with
that analogy I feel like they just are
gonna get mad at me they're just they're
already pissed off like just don't anger
them anymore just put a little mascara
on try to look a little bit more you
know put together and then get on set
and I find that I like the look still
too so I do like the look of tight
lining still I just don't like the
product on my eyes so anyway that's been
the reason I haven't used as much of it
as posited so I'm trying to I'm gonna
try to make some more progress on it I
don't think I'll have that finished up
by the end of the year but I think I can
get a little bit more progress on it
we'll see I can't believe we made it
through this video thank you guys so
much for watching me and putting up with
all my craziness in my videos I I truly
appreciate it and I really hope that you
guys go check out the other people in
this project thank you to everyone you
know who joined this I think it's so
cool and I'm excited to see where we all
end up it's just so fun like I really do
truly enjoy using up my products like
there's something just so satisfying and
so fun about you know enjoying a product
or maybe finding a product that you
don't hate but like making it work for
you and you know getting your money's
worth out of it and you know not just
getting rid of that product but knowing
that it's like gone like you used all of
it
um I'm super chatty right now I'm gonna
go I hope you enjoyed thank you so so
much for
guys I'll see you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
