so sorry about my voice but we're just
gonna have to deal with it I am getting
over a sickness so I'm not as sick as i
was but you can definitely hear it in my
voice so we're just gonna hopefully get
over that this is going to be my finish
13 by Halloween finale I'm sorry it's a
little late but it did take me a while
to get this filmed I just got back then
I got sick so anyway I haven't used
anything past that date so everything
here is where I really am and was I
didn't like finish anything up in those
days anyway so let's just get into it I
feel really good about this project I
used a lot of stuff up and a few things
that I didn't finish spoiler alert I'm
kind of okay with so let's just get into
it the first thing we'll talk about that
I finished this was my covergirl
three-in-one outlast stay fabulous
foundation I finish this up early on in
the project I thought there was more in
it than there was and I had to like
scrape it out because the pump broke but
this is done I did finish up a whole
foundation I believe I started it around
like here or so so definitely not full
or something but still out of my
collection the next one I have to show
you guys that I finish is my highlighter
my goal is just to hit pan on this
highlighter this is from bareMinerals
and it's in the love affair I really
liked this highlighter I enjoyed it the
entire time i used it so happy to hit
pan I don't think I've ever hit pan on a
highlighter so I was very excited about
that and so for my rules for this this
was completed I had a couple lip
products in this challenge so one of
them was the korres lip butter in the
shade in the scent guava and this was
like a white color but it is all cleared
out in there you can't see anything in
there cuz there's nothing in there so I
finished that up dropping everything and
then once I finished that I moved on to
my will ADA will ADA I know how to say
I'm sorry lip balm that I had gotten in
France and that is it rolled up all the
way there is no more roll
that I can do so it is gone as well so I
was really happy it was right at the end
I finished it's only a couple days
before october ended so definitely ran
close but it is gone super happy about
that did you hear that another thing
dropped I had a lip scrub in here this
is from freshers is the sugar lip polish
I did end up finishing this so there's
nothing in there but I did not use it on
my lips I really didn't enjoy this
product on my lips it was there's just
not enough granules for how like waxy /
moisturizing it's supposed to be and
also the sugar dissolves before I feel
like I can get a good scrub I can't just
lick the sugar off I just didn't like it
so I was using this as like a hand scrub
in like a cuticle scrub and that is how
i used it up I still got quite a few
like hand scrubs in here I just mostly
did like the back of my hands when I do
it so I'd like put a little tiny dollop
on here and then I would kind of rub it
back and forth and that's how i use this
up as well as like massaging it into my
cuticles but I mean it still took a long
time to use this up doing it that way I
mean I didn't do it every other everyday
or anything but still it took a while
but it's done so I'm really happy that
at least it got used I'm not just like
throwing away her passing it on it's
gone I used it I made it work for me and
I would not repurchase the last lip
product that I had in this project I did
not finish up which is so sad so here
are the marks on it I started all the
way up here and I got to all the way
down here I did my best with this as you
can see there's barely anything in there
I'm not going to zoom up close because
i'm using a different camera than i
normally do and it's kind of difficult
but seriously the smallest amount of
product it's kind of disappointing
because i know that if i had just pushed
myself a little bit harder on this one
it would have been gone but i'm also at
the same time really happy that I got as
close as I did really close but no cigar
on that one so that was one out of the
13 I didn't finish up let's go into some
more face products not that it matters
this is my bare minerals concealer and
bisque I finished it guys I did it it's
gone so excited I
it took like the little stopper thing
out and I'm really happy I got to use
this up it's just this product even
though it was a tiny mini size it just
took forever to use up and it's because
it's just so pigmented it's a powder
concealer so it's even more pigmented
than they're like foundations it just
took a long time the color match was not
a good one for me but I made it work and
it's gone I feel so glad I stuck with it
and I just finished it up even though it
was super difficult at the end but it's
gone now and yeah it's gone my
maybelline dream lumi concealer in the
color ivory this one i finished up like
really early on these just go really
fast i'm not going to go into it because
I said it and like every single update
but I finished this I do like this
product this is another one I used up
quite early on in this project this is
the Stila CC cream just a tiny little
guy it was grain when it came out and
then it kind of like change to your skin
tone one of those things i used this in
conjunction with the foundation I've
already showed you that I used up in
this project just because I wanted
something with more coverage when I
first started this project I had quite a
lot of hormonal breakouts on my chin and
like just this like job portion of my
face I was breaking out horribly is very
stressed out so yeah I was showing in my
skin for sure so I just need a more
coverage than this would give but I feel
like now that my skin is back to normal
I would enjoy using this I don't think
I'll like try to find it out because
it's probably discontinued at this point
but it was nice oh all that just to say
it was nice I'll finish with the two
other items that I actually finished so
this is the Elizabeth mot eyeliner in
the color pearl I used this on my inner
corner and it is so teeny a teeny weeny
little guy and I actually liked this at
the end I went back and forth on loving
this and hating this and loving this and
hating it it was in my finished 7 by
spring so I wanted to finish this up
quite a long time ago I don't know why
but it went way faster in this project
than it did in my first one probably
because I was in like the hate phase I
don't really know but um I
I'd repurchase this product may be like
way way way way way down the line but it
it had great staying power I will say
that about this and the last thing I
actually finished up with my Jordana
faby brow in the color taupe and there
is like no even product left in there
it's just an empty hole gosh my voice
it's an empty hole I had to repeat that
okay anyway that is it that's all I was
left this isn't even product though so I
finished that up I did really enjoy this
pencil I think for the price you cannot
be that I think it's seriously like two
dollars and for that how can you go
wrong for two dollars I felt like the
color was nice I've got compliments all
the time of my brows at work so yeah I
would repurchase this definitely I have
quite a stock of brow pencils for
whatever reason leave just like you know
gravitated toward me lately so I won't
be repurchasing this in the near future
but I definitely would repurchase it
again onto the products that I didn't
finish so in total I didn't finish for
so I already showed you the lip product
this is another product I did not finish
up this is from colour-pop it's their
shadow in the color lovely I had already
hit pan before I started this project so
I can't even say that that was progress
on this project I didn't want to use
this I really just didn't use it this
color pop I shout out and specifically
it's just like a glitter ball and
although i love my glitter sometimes I
just don't want that all the time and
lately I've been really into like warm
creases and like purpley blue iridescent
pink kind of shades all together and
this just wasn't a part of that love
right now so it was just difficult to
use and I wasn't going to sit there and
force myself to use this up and have
like glitter all over my face all day
long so i didn't use this up I mean I
wish I did because I wish it was gone
but I'm also glad I didn't force myself
because I really really really didn't
want to use it so um yeah it kind of
sucks that I didn't finish it for the
project but I'm glad that I didn't you
know force myself to do it the last two
items were these two liners from stila I
was very ambitious with this project
because I am in a currently a project
pan roulette which my goal is to finish
that
just so you guys know by the end of the
year I want to have my 10 items finished
but I was finishing up a liner whoo I
was finishing up a liner in that project
before I even started these so I didn't
even start these I think until like at
least two weeks in if not more into the
project and then I still wanted to
finish up two of them which I think one
of them was full-size like all the
product and the other one seriously was
really close I mean it wasn't even
halfway done so it was definitely
ambitious too hot basically try to
finish up three liners in like three
months but I think I did a really good
job still on what I did so for this one
I started all the way up on that line
and seriously I have that much product
left like there is no prob that's it
that's all I have left I just couldn't
finish it you know I'm not gonna like I
don't know get myself a brown eye so
like instead of a black guy around I
because it's a brown liner but I'm not
going to do that just to finish this up
so have the tiniest bit left of this
which I still feel good about and then
my goal was to like finish this up
before I even started this but I think I
lost that liner for a while or I don't
know I just didn't do that and so I
started this one two and four I think
some of my lines have marked off because
I don't know if I started there if this
is like the second line but this is a
line that I could redraw on so at some
point I was here and now i am almost at
the same point as an other liner but on
this one just a little bit more product
on this one left I've really enjoyed
using this liner on the lower lash line
it just really gave a warmth to my look
and I've been liking that warm kind of
look so it really complemented well so
those two sadly did not get finished but
they were so so close that is my like
fine-fine alley that is my finale for my
finished 13 by halloween i ended up
seeing what was that nine out of 13 I
still consider that a success I was out
of town for a little bit as well so yeah
I think I did a great job it's a lot of
makeup moved out of my collection since
everything in this project was makeup
and I'm really excited to bring you my
next project pan which I will be filming
right after this I have a lot of project
pan type of videos to film so I hope you
guys are having a great day I've seen
some of your guys's finales already so
everyone did really well with this
challenge so congratulations to everyone
