channel I thought I would start this
video out and just say I didn't mention
in my first one so I'm sorry but I just
wanted to welcome any of my new
subscribers it's been a while since I
like welcomed any of you so thank you so
much to everyone who subscribed to me I
appreciate all of your guys's love and
support and let's get into this video
this is going to be my 13 by halloween
video i did just upload a pan that
palette roulette which i will link down
below but i thought since i'm doing that
one and really i just have some items i
want to focus to finish up by the end of
the year that I could I could do another
one and there's a lot of time in between
this start date of this project and the
undated this project so I thought that
there was a good chance that I could be
really successful if I was strategic
about the items i picked so here are the
13 items that I'd like to finish up by
the 31st of October or halloween one of
the items I'd like to finish up is this
product by covergirl this is the outlast
stay fabulous foundation I am about here
on the packaging you can kind of see it
I know that doesn't seem like a lot of
products but I am in the middle of
finishing out a couple other foundations
that I'm not going to throw into this
project so I thought this is definitely
a doable item that I could definitely
focus on and get out of my collection by
the third I was want to say the 13th of
Halloween do they make sense by
Halloween and I did keep everything in
this project um makeup items I was going
to do like bath and body stuff because I
have my other project going on but then
I thought no Lauren just go for a girl
and just do makeup so all of these items
are makeup I do have some lip balms but
I consider those like makeup items so I
also have this mini guys so this is
number 2 i'm counting it this is still a
CC cream and this one's in the color
light this is expiring in august so i
will be using this up super soon it's
just because of the SPF in it so i will
be making sure that i use this up by
august so this will be one of the first
items to go it's not much product but
again it's another item out of my
collection i also decided to throw in a
concealer this one is maybelline's dream
lumi and this is in the color ivory i
use this on
my eyes I really like the consistency of
this product but um I was watching
pretty pistol or cherishes video and she
was talking about this product and how
it goes so fast and it really does you
use this product up so so fast so um and
I used it basically every single day so
this one will not be hard to get through
but again it's just another item out of
my collection by halloween i have this
product here this one is actually in my
project pan like for the whole year it's
one of the items i want to use up by the
end of the year this is bare minerals
bisque concealer it's a powder concealer
and i am where that line is I know it's
kind of hard to see so I just want to
finish this up it's been really
difficult to use this product I just I
probably won't have another like powder
concealer if I got anything like this
would be like the well rested from
bareMinerals but not this product I want
to move through this this came in like a
set or something like that I definitely
didn't buy this on its own and it'll
feel good to get it gone because it'll
be like two birds with one stone it'll
be done for my like year-end project and
it also be done for this project the
last kind of like face item i have here
is this bareMinerals highlighter this is
in the color or in the shade the love
affair I just want to hit pan on this
item and that's it there you can see the
dip I have going already so I just want
to hit pan and be nice to have it as big
as the brush but even just hitting pan
to me would be successful I really do
like this shade it was in one of my
favorites videos it's a great one and
it'll just feel nice I don't think I've
hit pan on a highlighter oh one time I
did one time on this Milani one but umm
it'll just feel good to hit pan on this
product and I do enjoy it so it won't
feel horrible to use up I'm gonna go on
to my eye products now I put this color
pop shadow in in the color lovely I have
already hit pan on this item and it is
in my project to use up by the end of
the year this is just my way of like
trying to get it done even before that
it's a really nice shade that's it's
watched there so it's a very neutral
shade I can use this all over the lid
and even if I'm doing a really simple
look and it'd be really pretty I can use
it to glam up something so I don't think
it'll be a problem to use this up and
there isn't much product in these
shadows so once you hit pan
and you can see how thin the pan is and
there's really not a ton of product
which I'm not complaining about it's I'm
just saying like I don't think it'll
it's not like using a powder eyeshadow i
don't think so i'm going to try to use
that up by halloween this is an eyebrow
pencil by jordana this is the fabu brow
and this is in the color taupe I have
that much product left i have been using
this like everyday i sharpen it about
every third time i use it two or three
times i use it and i have been enjoying
this product quite a bit i don't use
this little brush I think it's useless
but I just use like my spoolie from
Anastasia and then I'll use this product
and it's great this is only like two
dollars and I have been enjoying its all
probably repurchase once i use it up but
it'll be nice to get this out of my
collection I'm counting these two liners
as like the same thing these are both by
stila these are also in my urine project
I know I'm duplicating a lot of things
but it's kind of my way to actually move
those products out like yeah that's my
goal to use them but like what am i
doing about that I'm throwing them in
these projects so this one is in the
color berry I have it marked on the lid
here and anything that wasn't marked I'm
gonna make sure to mark and I'm even
going to try guys to write down my brow
pencil on a piece of paper I know I know
I'm gonna try I'm going to try to
actually show you guys like visible
progress that's how much product I have
its marked on the cap there hopefully
you can see that this is a berry color
so I'm probably going to use this one in
the fall time like closer to actual
halloween and then this one's in the
color teak and this one the progress is
there a that Barry 1 i've never used
really before and this one I have used
there's just not much product in these
pencils so that's where I am on that
hopefully that's just like the worst but
hopefully I can use these up pretty fast
I'm using one up also in my project pan
roulette one of these and I'm almost
done with it so I don't see a problem
finishing both of those up in the time
limit like at all so that'll be good
that'll be three liners out of the way
these do just like FYI and also I do
know they have like a smudger like see
how this is coming out and then you can
use this on your inner corner as a
shadow but i am not using any of that
powder product that's like in here I
don't care about it so I'm just using
the liner up I believe this is product
number nine this is a little tiny
Elizabeth mod perl little shadow stick /
eyeliner this isn't I finished 7 by
spring I believe and I didn't finish it
up then and I had this like weird
love-hate relationship with it and I am
liking it currently so um I just want to
finish it up there is not much product
left I'm going to also mark this on the
sheet of paper but there's not much left
I do like it now again so I'm not going
to be sad when it's gone but it's
hopefully not going to be horrible to
use up and it's almost there so I
thought that I was like only this long
like actual pencil this long last time
and it was really hard to use up so I'm
hoping now that it's a little bit
smaller I can actually finish this up by
Halloween the rest of the items are
actually all lip product so i would like
to finish up one of my fresh sugar lip
balms and this is in the color honey
this product is essentially folders
seriously only the tiniest bit used at
the top so um yeah that's what i want to
use up I really like this color and I
think it'll be nice it'll be a nice one
to use so i have a ton of those and i
want to try to work through them so
it'll be one more gone what's this
projects over and then I have to lip
balms this is a valletta I got this in
France it's a lip balm and I am there on
the cab I have it marked and I just want
to use this up because I don't want to
expire and I don't have much left of it
so it's like since it's over halfway
gone I might as well just finish it up
get it out and move on to something else
instead of starting something fresh when
I have that almost done this is
something I'm actually been working on
for a while and I just thought I'd throw
it in here
and get it gone even faster this is the
Korres guava lip balm I use this by my
bed it's hard to see in there but it's
pretty deep down in the pot already at
this point so this will be one of the
ones that moves out pretty fast and I
love the smell of this product but
because it's tinted white it can get
real freaky real fast like ghost lips
and it's kind of weird my poor husband
has to see me like cake this on at night
and I'm sure it's a scary site but um oh
it's upside down this whole time um but
I'm excited to get this done I don't
know if I'd repurchase it just because
it's not practical to wear this any
other time but I'll be excited to get it
done I do like it though if you're
willing to risk it I would recommend the
actual product is good and then the last
item for my project number 13 this is a
lip scrub by fresh and this is there
sugar lip polish I just thought that
since i have been using a lot of
products i could keep this by my sink in
the morning and after I've moisturize my
lips all night I could use this to kind
of slough off any of the dead skin I
find bad I don't have like dry flaky
skin I have like what flaky slips if
that makes sense like because I
moisturize them all night I feel like as
much as they're nice and soft the skin
on them is also loose I know this is
sounding so weird oh it's just like I
want to give them a good scrub still so
I thought this would be a good one to
kind of implement in things that I'm
actually doing every single day but also
completing it in a project those are my
13 items let me know if you guys are
doing this project down below so I can
keep up with your progress I thought
this was such a fun fun challenge I
think that Halloween is such a festive
holiday and I don't know it's fun to
incorporate like makeup and using things
up because I'm really into that and
excited about that right now and
combining that with Halloween is just a
fun idea i hope you guys are having a
wonderful day thank you so much for

you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
