Lauren thank you so much for watching
I'm super excited because today I'm
bringing you an intern to a new project
and this is going to be the 13 by
Halloween
I'm so excited I've done this every
single year on my channel this is a fun
project for me because although it's a
lot of items you do have quite a bit of
time to make progress on those items and
I've been doing a lot of projects pans
collabing which has been super fun but
in this project I really wanted to go
through my collection and pick items
that I'm almost on the brink of using up
and really push through in this project
and get some finish I feel like my
makeup empties are kind of lacking this
year compared to the last two years and
we're halfway through the year so I
really just want to move out some items
that are like almost done and not have
to kind of sit into any categories of
like it has to be this or it has to be
that so I'm really excited to hopefully
see a lot of product move out I'm just
going to get into it I have a lot of
stuff here something that I've decided
to do is as I use things up in my
projects I will be adding new items in
to replace those items just so it isn't
it boring but also I really do want to
actually use up 13 items and not every
single one of these items is like a
finish up type of goal some of it is
just like hit pan so anyway let's just
get into it I have two primers that I
want to use up this is the Smashbox
photo-finish this is a pore minimizing
primer and I used to really love this
this is my second tube of it and it's
nice but I just prefer different things
on my skin now and this I find just is
kind of drying and it also kind of
balled up I feel like with so many
different moisturizers and different
products that I just don't enjoy it so I
do want to get this out of my collection
and finish it up it does work really
well though if you are looking to smooth
out any texture on the skin and I'm
going to try really hard to be good with
pictures on anything that I can and to
like mark things as much as I hate
editing in pictures and taking pictures
I really do think it's the best way to
see progress I know that there are so
many project painters now which i think
is so often that the community has grown
so much but it's really hard to like
stay up-to-date with everyone so it's
nice to be able to jump into a video and
like see the progress even if you
weren't there from the beginning where
you miss
update or whatever so the other primer
that I have here this is the hello fat
coconut skin smoothing primer
moisturizer and it's from first aid
beauty I don't know when I got this but
I just want to use it up I almost forgot
that I've had it which is a small little
deluxe example so it shouldn't be too
big of a deal and I like that it's more
moisturizing I feel like it's just a
good time for me to use this for what
I'm like liking with my skin right now
and that is completely new I haven't
used it at all something that I've been
loving a lot lately and just kind of
want to make some progress in is B cap
on the alchemists palette now I am using
this today it's in my inner corners I've
really been into the green shade which
is kind of weird I have it on as a
highlight on my nose on my like Cupid's
bow on my inner corner I've just been
really into the duochrome highlight in
the inner corner and just like on the
face so I just want to make some
progress on this I'd like to hit pan on
one of the shades I don't know which one
because honestly my tastes of those back
and forth they have a green a blue a
purple and a pink duo come in here but I
really feel like when I first got this
palette I got it because it's Kat Von D
and because I knew it was going to be
limited edition I didn't want to like
miss out on it but I never gave it like
a fair fair shot and I've been using it
a lot lately and really enjoying it so I
want to just continue to see progress in
it there are quite a few like face
products in here because I feel like I
can actually go through them and if you
saw my declutter my powder and
foundation drawer a lot of it was stuff
that's like almost done so I really
wanted to just like kill off those items
that we're just being bulky in my
collection so for face powders I have
three different powders I want to use up
the person here is from Revlon this is a
nearly naked powder in fair I've already
hit pan on it this is the powder that
has the most product in it out of the
three of children but I do think that I
can get through this I feel like I've
barely used this product and I've
already hit pan so I don't think that
this will be an issue
I do use less powder than I used to but
I definitely still have to powder my
face the next one is from black opal and
this is basically almost done I moved it
out of my kit because it's just at the
point where it's hard to use and it's
just easier to get a new powder than to
like repress it and all that junk but I
do need a repress this so that I can use
it easier for myself and I just want to
get this gone and use it up this is an
just translucent powder but it works on
all skin tones and the last is a product
from pure resistant c4 and one powder
and I've used up one of these in the
past and this is my second one to go
through I'm almost done with this as
well the light shade is more warm toned
which works for my skin but it's a
little bit dark so I have to use this up
basically in the summer I feel like this
is a super beautiful powder I do really
like it if you're into mineral makeup or
if you're into powder foundation you
probably would really like this I know
their shade range isn't the best but
it's a nice powder so I'm excited to get
this one gone this is pretty bulky in my
collection and there really just isn't
much powder left in it another
complexion product this is from Villalon
and this is the cream foundation and
medium light number one again this is a
bit dark for me when I'm in the winter
so I want to use it up in the summer
while I have a more tan complexion I've
already hit pan on this I do enjoy this
product I think it works really nice I
reckon it with a brush I'm hoping to use
it a lot but if I use the path of what's
left in here I would be very very happy
with that I got this from obsolete and I
haven't had it tuned to long and since I
do enjoy it or you want to use it up so
I thought why not do it now now is the
time I have two concealers I want to
work through the first one here is from
Maybelline this is the master concealed
by face studio in the shade light again
I'm usually the shade fair when it comes
to concealers but with summer I can get
away with the light shade so I'm pretty
far down under they want to say I'm like
- here I got this from autumn she sent
it over to me in a big package with a
bunch of different makeup she was
declutter in I do like it I think it
works really nice it has a nice coverage
so I just want to get this out of my
collection I don't hate it by any means
but it's just another concealer and I
have quite a few right now the other one
I have here is from Revlon I just bought
this but it's going to go by so fast
it's the color stay under eye concealer
I truly do like the way that this looks
under the eyes I think it's a nice
medium coverage concealer it doesn't
give you too much coverage it looks like
skin I do really enjoy it I just knew I
could get through it so I thought I
would throw it in here and not let it
sit around in my collection just kind of
move through it fast if you do like this
concealer or want to try it out I
suggest checking out my blogs because I
got it there for like two dollars and
some change which is the deal I have for
more products left
you guys the next one is from Milani and
this is the sunset based bronzer this is
part of a limited edition release with
this and another bronzer that were matte
I do really like this it can look a
little bit warm on my skin so again
while I'm more tan I want to take
advantage of it and I just want to hit
pan this is a baked product but mine is
completely flattened out because I have
used it a lot and I do really enjoy it
it's just one of the older bronzers in
my collection from what I didn't
declutter in my declutter I'll leave
those like down below if you haven't
seen them so it will be really often to
just see pan in one of my bronzers and
relax I have three different eyeliners I
want to go through I know that seems
excessive but two of these are like on
the way out the first one here is from
Stila it's just a white Kajal liner
there's barely any left but I feel like
this just lasts forever
I really like this one I tried one from
Maybelline and it sucked so I hope I can
find something to replace this if you
have a good white eyeliner that's
inexpensive
please let me know down below because
this is part of like my everyday routine
next I have a liner here from Urban
Decay this is in the shade 1999 it's
really pretty purpley burgundy color I
don't have much I'd obviously use this
quite a bit I think it's nice I would
not repurchase it I don't think you can
I think it's just continued but I just
want to finish it up so little and last
I have a liner here from Laura Geller
and this is the incredible waterproof of
gel eyeliner in brown sugar it's just a
nice dark brown I prefer dark Browns
over black in my tight line so that is
everything that I have left on that it's
not a lot of products so I definitely
think I can work through this okay that
is everything guys I hope you enjoyed
this intro I know there will be some
other ladies joining in who were also
involved in the 12 pants of Christmas
they're going to do something a little
bit more themed which will be really fun
so definitely look out for that and if
you guys want to join in of course join
in this is just like you know this is
just like a regular basic one but I'm
kind of excited to see some real good
progress thank you so much for watching
guys and I will see you in my next video
