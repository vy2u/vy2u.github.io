Lauren this is going to be my finish 13
by Halloween finale I can't believe it's
already been the finale
I've been looking back at old videos and
I'm gonna do like a whole chitchat just
like about me looking back on my videos
and just my thoughts cuz I really can
get be fun just to kind of do one of
those videos like once a month or so I
just can't believe it's been that long I
can't believe you're already here it's
the end of October so let's get into my
progress and I'll show you the items I
used up I think I just barely missed it
by two products which is upsetting but
it is what it is so I just want to say
thank you real fast to everyone who
joined in on this project with me I
really appreciate all your guys's
support and the fact that you guys like
took the time to make videos and also
work on this project with me I just
appreciate it and it's really awesome so
thank you for everyone who joined in I
hope you had fun with me too so I'm
gonna run through the products that I've
used up unless they're the new ones
pretty dang fast if you want like
reviews check out my other videos
they're linked down below and you guys
can kind of know what I think about them
I really want to try to keep it to a
minimum though and it probably won't be
first thing that I used up new for this
around for the finale is the Sephora
Pantone universe and I was working on
the highlighter in here and I hit pan
and look at it look at it look at in the
face I'm so happy that I met pan on this
this is the second or third highlighter
I've hit pan on now and I really did
enjoy this highlighter it's not too
metallic which I really like it's just a
really nice one so I enjoyed using this
I will continue to use it but I am going
to be just branching out trying new
things
but I'm really glad I could put some
really good focus that's like a big
thing to do to hit pan on the
highlighter is pretty pretty big the
next thing used up was taught by Marc
Jacobs now I started the project with it
here last update I got here and now
there's like nothing left there's like a
drop left but I can't squeeze it out oh
look now it does it but it's gone guys
it's gone so happy to get this out it
smells good but it's not me definitely
not me it's just a little too sweet I
don't know it's just not my favorite
anymore so I'm so glad it's gone like
that's so weird it's not gonna be in my
perfume collection anymore last thing
new that I used up was the Urban
weinerman roach as you can see it just
looks like two gray things because it's
all gone that's it
I can't sharpen this anymore so it's
done and it's like hurting my eye I
think it's fair to say goodbye to it
really enjoyed this liner I really like
the color and I don't really feel like
these liners stay very well on the
bottom waterline but I do like them on
the top I don't find that they transfer
down too bad so I did enjoy it so let's
do like a speed run through and I'm
talking about speedy girl of the other
products I've already used up in this
project I use of the lip butter from
Korres in the color and scent Jasmine I
love this one that's the only review
you're getting one of my goals was to
use up six of these little mini perfumes
those are all gone I had a highlighter
in here and this is the Maybelline fit
me I finished that up this is the
Toshiba luce from by Terry and the
number two used it up I had a mini
bronzer in here from NARS this is the
Laguna and it's gone
I had a shadow in here this was a light
matte cream shade from the brand sm8
shadows in the color cracker
I had already hit pan on it so I just
finished it up in this project and then
I had a little mini of the Mac prep and
prime skin base massage and use this up
not here with me anymore because I gave
it away it's the kat von d palette I
will leave a picture my goal is to hit
pan on one of the shadows and I did do
that
that also is counted as a win and now on
TV products left in the project I'll go
with you want to have the most progress
on first this is dinars narcissist dual
intensity palette I'm trying not to
blind you and not have the shadows fall
out okay ultimately I didn't hit pan I'm
really close and I'm just gonna call it
quits and give it away so I will be
bringing this to Arizona with me when we
go back for Thanksgiving I didn't hit
pan I was really close I'm just
overusing it I'd rather use other things
in my collection so this project to me
was successful in the fact that I'm
going to be decluttering it I tried to
use it and realize it's just not what I
love and that's okay it's okay hopefully
I won't do it again and buy an $80
palette that I just hate but it's okay
now the money's spent right I have these
two items this is the what's up
highlighter from benefit no new progress
on here I'm gonna also be tossing this I
don't want to use it I don't want to use
it it's obvious I don't want to use it
and I'm done torturing myself so you
feel so freeing I'm gonna get rid of
that sorry you don't really I'm not
really like showing the progress up
close but it's just because it's not any
different than it was so this is the
Tarte lip pencil and charmed
I started up here and I got two right
here no new progress on this this broke
off from the face I'm not into it I'm
getting rid of it I'm also throwing this
away my life is too short to be trying
to use this up I'd way rather use lip
colors that I actually enjoy if I'm
gonna wear lip color if not I'm gonna
put a bomb on and enjoy it I'm pretty
sure I only have three more products
here oh no I have a couple more actually
but I'm rolling them over in my new
project which will be up after this and
I'm super excited about it cuz it's a
collab with a ton of other people here
on YouTube and I'm really excited so
anyway this is the pur cosmetics primer
and this is like a glowy primer I really
didn't get much past this I thought I'd
be able to use this up really fast but I
just wasn't using it it's not that it's
been taking longer it's just like you
have to use it for it to go away so I'll
be rolling this over but I didn't finish
that up this is probably my most
disappointing item I really did want to
finish this this is the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage airbrush foundation
in light
I just it's too dark and so I was using
in different ways you guys are trying to
help me I appreciate it it's just a
really heavy and I just don't really
like it but I will be finishing this at
some point I'm not gonna get rid of it
but I really have no new progress as of
last time so what's the back thing here
I got to like about there I feel like I
used about half of it up so that's good
but I just want to out of my life and
I'm not ready to part with it because it
was so expensive and I feel like I can
find a way to use this so I'm keeping it
but I hope that I really hope it'll be
gone soon I have my lip liner here I
don't have the card for it right now
with me so I'm just gonna show you it
here but it was pretty long I think it
was like probably this tall or so from
the beginning so I used a lot of this up
I'm gonna also roll this over I have a
love-hate relationship with this part of
me likes it part of me doesn't the color
is really nice though these are
definitely long wearing and the last two
items are the ones I added in last time
and there's really no progress on it so
the first one I added in the orange
shade from the modern renaissance
palette and I didn't even touch it but
look at this I hit pan on golden ochre
yesterday I was like what the Freak so
that's disappointing cuz I've barely had
this palette I feel like I don't know I
can today hit pan on that this shade
exploded though that's why there it was
just not packed very well no progress on
the shadow that was actually in the
project and then for something sparkly I
picked up this sand shimmer pigment from
gorgeous and I use this a couple of
times there's no way in hell that I'm
gonna be using this up though it's so
glittery and it's beautiful for the
right look but for everyday it's just
too much like it's just not my thing and
it doesn't work well wet I don't know
why it just doesn't work well it looks
better just like it padded with your
finger on the lid so for the person
who'll have the comment asking about how
long this would take and like you were
excited to see me use this I failed this
bowl I'm really sorry I really didn't
use it very much so I hope whatever
pigment you were
use if you're trying to use it that you
just have like 10 million times of
success of me okay that's my update
finale guys I hope you enjoy
so I officially used up 11 items I was
two away
I was so close on stuff but I am too
cluttering three items so technically
I'm still getting those out of my
collection if we want to try to count
those I hope you guys enjoyed and
definitely a stay tuned for my new
project pan that I'm going to be
starting it's gonna strike the first of
November so that's when that video will
go live I'm so excited I'm gonna film it
right now so yeah stay tuned for that
and I will see you guys in my next video
