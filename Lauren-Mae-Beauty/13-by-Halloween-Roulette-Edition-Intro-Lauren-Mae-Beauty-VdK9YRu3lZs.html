Lauren thanks so much for watching I am
so excited because this is going to be
my intro for my project pan roulette
finish 13 by Halloween I'm starting this
project pretty dang early because
project panel ants are kind of crazy and
you don't know what you're gonna get and
sometimes it takes a long time to finish
a bronzer or a blush or to hit pan on
those items and I want to give myself
enough time to be successful and to make
this fun let's get into picking the
items I've written I've written down I
think that's right
written down 50 different things it's a
lot I will leave them down below if you
want to know what my suggestions were I
broke them down on a piece of paper
instead of cutting them up and I'm just
gonna use a random number generator to
just pick them and then I'll highlight
them as I use them for me it just seemed
easier in my original video which I'll
leave links down below I did it with the
paper and I just don't want to keep a
can of paper this is just gonna be
easier I think hopefully we'll see how
it works out so I'm picking 13 items and
then as I finish those items I'm going
to rotate in new ones and pick new
pieces I didn't do that in my original
one and I feel like at the end there
were only a couple things left and it
was just kind of boring updates so I
feel like rotating them in we'll just
keep it more fresh and more fun and will
give me more options if something's just
completely impossible or I really don't
like something there's a new item that I
can finish up to hopefully hit my 13
items by Halloween I'm using a random
number generator this is from random
gorg I will leave that down below as
well and we'll see let's generate so
number forty-seven six perfume samples
so on here just so you guys know - I did
perfume I have one nail polish
suggestion or like pick and then the
rest are mostly makeup except for one
skincare - it was kind of hard to come
up with 50 so I had to have a couple
other things okay that one's not too bad
I'm not really worried about that
number 49 that one is a product you just
like awesome that's great number 39
something I haven't used in over a year
number 42 why are they all so high but
something pink that one will be hard I
wear pink all the time here is know that
4:36 a tart item so I put some items in
here that I felt like or some brands in
here that I felt like I had some stuff
with so I should kind of choose an item
that way number 22 something I have
never used before now that seems like a
sick one because you know you buy all
this makeup there's something you
haven't used before but I know you
makeup addicts out there know what I'm
talking about where you buy something
and you've never used it ever so this
project I will be introducing something
that I have never used number 21 so one
higher than that something I regret
purchasing what the heck they're all
negative let's see how many I have right
now one two three four five six seven so
I have about half to go number 19 I feel
like this random one is kind of like not
very random a lip product I normally
would be kind of scared of that but
there's a lot of time and I've been
doing really well on the lip product in
my current project I got 21 again number
7 a cream product number 30 a bronzer
number 8 oldest item in your collection
that's a good one to kind of clear out
something number 14 which is something
you have already hit pan on sounds kind
of hard number 31 a chapstick or a lip
balm that one's a good one okay so
that's all 13 guys I am going to be
right back I'm gonna go pick my items
and I'll show you which items I pick for
which category okay so I am back I've
picked my 13 items it took kind of a
while because I was trying to be
strategic on different items I was
picking what I thought I could use let's
get into it I'm just gonna go and order
from my list the first thing on my list
here is a cream product I decided to go
with an item that was already in a
project pan this is benefits what's up
highlighter
we all got these as birthday samples
like a couple of years ago that's how
much I have left it's not the full size
I just felt like this needs to go and I
know a lot of other people have panned
it in the time that I panned it to and I
think I have a better grasp on myself
and how I can handle this so I'm hoping
that I can get through this before
Halloween the next item is the oldest
item in your collection now a lot of the
items in my I use twenty by twenty
sixteen by the end of 2016 a lot of
those items are old but I didn't put any
lip products in that because I didn't
want to force myself to use up lip
products so
the products or some of my lip products
they're kind of old so I chose this
tarte lipsurgence and this is in the
color charmed and it has a mark on it
because last year I wanted to use it up
in 2015 and I didn't so that's how much
I have left on it I've used this a
couple times I thought this would be a
nice one for summer it's not very
pigmented it's just like a nice light
pink wash so I'm hoping I can get
through this and I've been into this
type of lip product so I think that I
can do this
the next item was something I already
had pan on and I decided to go a little
easy I guess on myself on this one this
is an eye shadow from SM H it's in the
color cracker it's just a matte cream
color I hit pan on this in my pan that
palette that I'm doing I'll leave a link
down below for that I already hit pan on
it and since it's a cream color it just
would be easy to clear it out get rid of
this shadow and not have this pan just
hanging around since I have so many
other cream shades so I think this one
will be pretty easy and I'm excited to
use up a whole shadow the next item was
a lip product since I already threw in
the Tarte lip product I was kind of like
oh no what am I gonna do I decided to
put in a lip liner this is from the
brand by Terry I got this because we
switched it out because it's getting
kind of short and it's just a really
pretty rose nude kind of color these lip
liners are amazing they stay on the skin
so long I think that a similar formula
to these would be the makeup forever lip
liners like that's how long they stay
there like waterproof they just stay on
all day so that's it there this is in
the color rose contour and I figured I
could wear this shade by itself I could
wear it with that pink if I wanted to I
just felt like I could pair them
together or pair them apart and I could
get a lot of use out of both of them at
the same time number 21 was something I
regret purchasing I seriously feel like
I got so many like more negative ones so
something I regret purchasing is this
palette from NARS this is the narcissus
palette and it is they're like dual
intensity one I wanted this so bad I had
Sam purchase it for me I think for my
birthday or something and I just regret
it so I want to hit pan on one of the
shades in here I think I'm gonna try to
do this one which I believe is Himalaya
or I might try to do one of these shapes
I haven't decided we'll see as the
project goes along which shades I
gravity
- this is like that lighter white one
this one in the middle you can't really
see it because it's kind of like my
flesh tone it has like a duochrome pink
to it and then that one so I don't know
which one I want to work on but I do
want to hit pan on one of those
eyeshadows something I have never used
before I'm ashamed to say it but I've
never used this palette ever on my eyes
I've only ever swatched it this is the
star studded eyeshadow book from Kat Von
D this came out holiday of 2014 so it's
definitely over a year old it has like
the little paper and then those are what
the shadows look like again I don't know
what I want to use in here and yet but I
do want to hit pan on one of the
eyeshadows in here so I've never used it
so we'll see and also I think it'll be
nice because I don't know if I want to
keep this palette since I haven't used
it and so trying to hit pan on the
shadow or working through a couple of
these and seeing which ones I like I
think will help me decide if I want to
keep this after this project or not I
mean they're pretty but I've just never
used it how it's just so sad it's like
the saddest thing the next one is a
bronzer and I had a perfect item for
this this is my NARS mini Laguna bronzer
I didn't show this in my bronzer
collection because I just forgot to I
don't know why I just hit pan on this a
couple days ago ever since basically
that Smashbox one has been busted up and
I haven't been able to use it until I
refreshed head so I want to finish up
this entirely since I've already have
pan I definitely think I can do that by
October this is like my bronzer I'm
wearing it today I really like this
bronzer and I don't think this will be
an issue at all for chapstick / lip balm
I decided to go with my Korres jasmine
lip butter I love this lip butter this
smells so good to me it's like a I call
it like a brunt cotton candy it just
smells so good and I've been working on
this ever since my Nivea lip balm was
used up so I have made quite a bit of a
dent in a short amount of time so I
don't know if you can see that I'm
working on this area here and you can
see there's more of like the side
showing on that I just want to finish
this up I don't think this will be a
problem at all I use this at night
before I go to bed and I just really
enjoy this product I definitely would
repurchase this once I have like no lip
balms a Tarte item I kind of was not
stupid but I use them a lot of Tarte
items in my Tarte one brand project pan
earlier
this year and then I also throw in like
the lip surgence at something else so I
didn't have a lot of options but I
decided to throw in my powder foundation
this is the Amazonian clay full coverage
airbrush foundation and this is in light
beige this is too dark for me and I just
ordered it online and that's why and I
should have returned it but I didn't but
I figured if I'm gonna use this it's
gonna be during this summer and why not
try to use it up so I am about here on
the product I'll mark all these and
you'll see them in the updates I don't
know why this one's kind of a wild card
I'm a little nervous about it but if I
can get through this I'll feel so happy
cuz I wasn't expecting to use this up
this year something I haven't used in
over a year that one was a little
difficult as well but I decided to go
with like a blush palette this is the
Sephora and Pantone universe palette and
this is for when radiant orchid was the
color of the year and I love this
palette you can tell I've gotten a lot
of good use out of it it's really nice
and I just want to hit pan I think on
this blush is what I'm going to be
working on but maybe this highlight or
two I just really want to work on this
I'm putting this in here just to get use
out of it
because I haven't used it in over a year
and it's such a beautiful palette so I
think it's just fun I think it's nice
and summery and since this will be
taking me I mean even past summer into
October I just thought this was a nice
pick something pink I'm a little nervous
for this one too but I decided to go
with Mac's sushi flower I just bought
this eyeshadow why I chose this is
because it's a just like a medium toned
paint it's not too pigmented though so I
feel like I could throw it in the crease
I could use it as a blush if I really
wanted to I just feel like I could use
it in a lot of ways and often without it
looking like a pink look so I'm gonna
try to hit pan on this Mac shadows are
pressed so hard so I'm a little nervous
cuz that's a hard one so if I use this
on my brows though with that stiff brush
that'll be a good way to use it too so
anyway I want a headband on Mac sushi
flour there's two more items left so I
chose six little perfume samples now I
have a ton of perfume samples and for a
while I was like I'm just gonna see them
I'm just collecting them I don't want to
use them and then the other day I was
going through it and I was like that's
so psycho you don't need to collect
these so I want to work through them now
and there are so many I have so many so
I think
through sex will be a nice start on
clearing these out I've already been
using some on my own so the six I chose
they're kind of all crazy
I chose Lancome Lavie a bell I also
chose ones that are more popular since
not just like random ones just because I
thought it'd be easier for me I've
picked Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb that's
kind of a heavy fragrance but we're
gonna use it do you can wipe your this
is DKNY be Delicious I think it's like
be delicious intense or something number
five this is dot by Marc Jacobs which I
have in the full-size and this one here
is product candy so I want to use all
six of those up I don't think that'll be
an issue I chose only once of sprayers
again to make it easier for me but it'll
be nice to kind of switch offs from
different perfumes and to see a lot of
items out of my collection last item and
this is a product that I dislike this is
something I got more recently from my
Mac order and it is kind of easy because
it's a deluxe sized mini but this is the
Mac prep and prime skin base massage
this is a nice texture it reminds me of
the Clinique super primer Universal face
primer but this has glitter in it and
Heather from love Heather rad mentioned
it and someone else mentioned it it just
doesn't make sense why this has like
legit glitter in it I put it on and I
was like did I have like eyeshadow
powder on my hands and then I put my
primer on like how is there so much
glitter on my face and then I use it the
next day and it was this and I like a
luminous glow but that's not luminous
and this is so different than even my
kitten prime color which is also
luminous that is just like a nice sheen
and it just looks so much better than
this and I think it's crazy cuz this
doesn't seem to be a luminous product
this is just like their normal skin base
product right which it's like I wouldn't
want to use this on people for like any
type of thing like no no I don't like
this product I don't suggest this
product I'm glad I got a sample of it so
I could try it and know that I don't
like it but I do not like this product I
don't understand why they did that with
this product
so those are my 13 items I'm really
excited to start this I'm gonna do
updates as I finish stuff so you guys
can see what new items I put into the
project and I obviously want to start on
the new item as soon as possible so I
think that's how my updates are going to
be dictated hopefully I'll have one
pretty soon
and then we can just keep up with the
progress as we go and as we get to
Halloween which is far off and I'm
really thinking I can finish all 13
items in this project I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video I'll see you in
my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
