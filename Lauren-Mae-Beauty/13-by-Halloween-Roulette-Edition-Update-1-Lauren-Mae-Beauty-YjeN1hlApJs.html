Lauren this is going to be an update for
my project pan roulette finished 13 by
Halloween I was not expecting to do an
update so soon but I have finished up
some products which I am so proud of I
wouldn't have started this project so
early if I thought I would finish up so
many things I do have harder things in
here left so you know I don't want to
get too ahead of myself but I'm really
happy with how well it's gone already so
let's just get into the items I finished
up first we'll do this first I wanted to
get this up so I could pick new items to
be working on the new items I'm gonna
add so the first thing here is the item
I've already hit pan on which was my s
mhm single eyeshadow and cracker and I
obviously used it all up it already had
pan I'm reap rested a little bit into it
and I use this to set my eye primer it
was just a matte cream color I really
enjoyed this shadow it is all gone I
probably won't repurchase it because
they're not super easy to get but I did
enjoy it
I don't think I've ever seen a pan of an
eyeshadow just completely like that I
used like I've never done that before so
that is so exciting the next item that
was completely finished up was the
category bronzer and for that I picked
this mini Laguna from NARS I had hit pan
on it I think in my last update and I
repressed this and that's what it looks
like now nothing I used it all up this
went so fast I don't know how people can
hang on to Laguna because I go through
it so so fast
I wasn't expecting to use it up this
fast it just like went so I'm really
happy about that though it's a whole
bronzer out of my collection even though
it's a mini it still counts as a full
product in my inventory so that is very
exciting and the last item I finished up
was this one from Mac this was in the
category of a product you dislike I
think let's see yeah product I just like
and this is the Mac prep and prime skin
base massage it's a primer and I'm not
surprised I went through this one this
is the one I thought it would finish up
because I use a lot of primer for this
big old face I don't like this it has
glitter in it it really does look like
you took an eyeshadow smashed it up in
your fingers after you rub it on your
face that's what your hands look like
they're that like shimmery
I didn't find that it really showed
through my makeup
much but just because of that it's just
not my favorite product so I won't
repurchase that and I'm really glad it's
done I just got this probably a month
ago maybe a month and a half ago so this
one was in my collection for like a
second three items guys it's so exciting
let's go through the rest of my progress
and then I will pick my new items at the
end for a cream product it picked the
benefit what's up highlighter I started
up the second line down here you know
it's hard to see but I haven't moved any
yet this is something that's been really
hard to just add into my routine I do
like the look of this on the face it's
just I keep forgetting to put it on
before I put on my powder I just like
using it when I have all my cream
products just fresh so I just need to
get better at incorporating this into my
routine just so I don't forget but I
have used this probably about like five
or six times there was not enough
progress to remarket on the packaging
the next item was my oldest item and I
chose the Tarte charmed lip surgence
pencil and they started from the top
mark there and I am down to there I'm
happy to even have progress to show you
you guys know that lip products are
pretty dang hard for me so I'm really
happy with that and this is gonna go
pretty fast if I just stick consistant
with it because it's so creamy so there
it is there I really don't think that
I'll have any trouble finishing this as
long as I use it because if you just use
this like five times you can see a
pretty big difference in the product the
next item I have is a lip product for
that I chose the by teary lip liner in
rose contour this is a really pretty
shade I'll show you swatch just a nice
nude rose color and I did a market on a
sheet of paper so let me show you that I
hope you can see this I started up here
and now I'm here and I didn't mark it at
the end I started the product there so
let me hold it that's where we're at so
definitely decent progress I'm really
happy with that
again if I consistently use this in this
way I don't think I'll have a problem
finishing that up either the next thing
is a product I regret purchasing I chose
the NARS dual intensity eyeshadow
palette this is just something that I
don't use and it was so expensive so my
goal on this is just to hit pan on
something and I
you know what shadow I was gonna choose
but I have decided I'm gonna be trying
to hit pan on this shade here this is
the color I think it's Andromeda it's a
really pretty color it's kind of a
whitish cream color with a pink shift
it's not 2 Duo crumby though that's its
watch there it's nice and it's pigmented
but honestly I just don't feel like it's
amazing I feel like so many people when
these came out said that these were like
the most amazing shadows they've ever
seen in their life and I don't feel like
that about them I feel like my makeup
geek perform just as well as this so I
want to hit pan on that and then I might
pass this on because really half of the
palette is all I really potentially can
use I just I'm not gonna use those
darker colors so we'll see about that
the next item was something I've never
used and for that I chose my Kat Von D
star-studded palette I did end up
ripping out the little sleeve part here
cuz it's just absolutely annoying I did
use this on my eyes today I have a
palette bingo I will leave that linked
down below this palette looks so
stunning when you first just look at it
and I was so excited to get it I was so
upset I didn't get the holiday palette
the year before this one came out after
using it today I still I'm not in love
with it so I don't know what shadow I'm
gonna start hitting pan on I've really
only used it the one time to do my
eyeshadows today I might totally cheat
out and do like a cream matte cream
color or something I do think that I
might give this away I might depart a
couple of the shadows because some of
them are so pretty but part of me is
like just give it to someone whole
Lauren you have dupes for everything in
here so that's that no progress besides
using it today and I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna use one of these is just like
setting my eyeshadow everyday boring I
don't know the next item I have was my
lip balm or my chapstick and I chose the
Korres lip butter and jasmine this
smells so good I love the smell of this
I don't know why I'm so obsessed but I
am that's what it looks like now as you
can see I hit pan at the bottom there
this had no pan showing when I started
so I'm definitely making great progress
in this I think this will definitely be
used up I use this at my bedside table
every single night and I love it so this
is something that I definitely think I
will repurchase in the future I don't
know when but it's something I really do
like but it's cold so it needs to go the
next item was my Tarte item I chose the
Amazonian clay full coverage airbrush
foundation in the
light beige that's what it looks like
inside in case you don't know I've used
this a couple times and I'm gonna make
progress on it there's no a new progress
though from the line I made so I'm just
gonna keep working on it and I don't
think that we'll see progress in it
until it's been a little bit this is my
item for something I haven't used in a
year this was a limited edition Sephora
and Pantone universe palette and it's a
blush palette this came out when the
Year radiant orchid was the color of the
year and I've decided from this palette
that I'm gonna be trying to hit pan on
the highlighter I know it's gonna be
really hard to see but I don't know if
you can tell there is starting to form a
dent at the base there I'm kind of
working it into the bottom of the pan or
a top of the pan and I'm going to try to
hit the bottom so I'm glad that I chose
something from this palette and I've
just been kind of consistently working
on it I do love that highlighter shade
it's the color Spanish villa or via and
I really like it so I've just been
working on that just my highlighter I
use every day except for today I'm using
the Marc Jacobs on which I've been
loving as well so that's that the next
item was something pink and this is max
sushi flower you can see a little bit of
a dent forming in the center there I
have been using this in my eyebrows a
couple of times I've also been liking
this paired with the color Sienna from
Anastasia and just been using this on
the lower lash line to really buff that
color out and I really liked about too
so I think that definitely by October I
can hit pan on this and hopefully I'll
hit pan on it sooner and just kind of
move it out and work on other things but
I do love this color it's kind of weird
because I don't feel like it swatches
very well at all like it looks a little
patchy but when you use it it's
beautiful so I really like this shade
the next item was six perfume samples
and this is gonna be kind of an easy one
so I think I'll be done with this pretty
dang soon I finished up three of them so
I finished up DKNY be Delicious this
smells really nice I don't think I'd
purchase it but I did enjoy it I
finished up Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb
this is nice it's not a me scent at all
it smells good and I know why other
people like it but it's just not me like
I think I'd like it on someone else but
I don't know I have a rollerball of this
too so I'll get through
it and I don't hate it or anything it's
just I prefer things that are a little
bit lighter a little bit more
yeah just lighter and the last one I
used up was candy from Prada this was
really nice as well I did enjoy this I
don't know if I would purchase this one
though there's a little bit left but
it's hard to get out let's see yeah it
won't come out and the three I sold to
use up these are this is Marc Jacobs dot
there's barely anything left so that's
almost done I have a full-size of that
perfume so it's nice this is Lancome
Livia Belle la vie a Belle this reminds
me of like a Viktor and Rolf flower bomb
it's like in a similar vein to me it's
not my favorite but again I can see why
people like it and that one's almost
used up and the only one I haven't used
yet is the DKNY pure and that should
take no time at all so that one really
isn't too bad but I'm really happy to be
getting out so many samples and that's
everything actually guys so let's pick
the new items I'm gonna pick three new
items from the list so I have random.org
right here I'm gonna pick three numbers
and we're gonna see so number 46 is the
first one let's see what that correlates
to on the list number 42 is an everyday
staple item so that will be fun to pick
out the next number was 39 and that is
an urban decay item and the last
replacement item is number 21 and that
is something you regret purchasing which
I've already picked so let's pick
another one let's try number 10 um so
number 10 is one of your most expensive
items so give me a second I'm gonna go
pick those three items to add and I'll
be right back alright I am back guys and
I have picked my three items the first
item here is from urban decay this is
their 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in roche
I wanted to pick this because I have so
many of their pencils so many of their
pencils because they bought the OTO loco
I think is what they were about two of
those I'm crazy so I have like at least
16 of these guys and I've been using
this actually recently a lot it's a
really pretty bronze color on my lower
lash line smudge it out with my fingers
so I just figured I would give myself
even more reason to use this every
single day and hopefully I can get this
done by Halloween that would be amazing
so that's my urban decay item my
everyday staple
it's gonna be the Maybelline fit me you
guys know I use this all the time it's
my number one fave I did accidentally
get it in the color light which i think
it's like the second time I've done that
so irritating so I need to use this up
in summer and I've been using this
basically just this as a foundation and
then using powder foundation over it so
I definitely want to use this up it's a
staple item I love this product and I
thought it was nice to use something I
actually like for my most expensive item
I honestly couldn't find something that
I thought was just stood out as the most
expensive so I picked a really expensive
item even though I didn't pay for it
this is the bite area to veloute and
this isn't number two this is a
highlighting concealer brush and this
has like a brush tip with it I got this
one we changed out the tester so I don't
know how much product is left in this
this is kind of an easy one but I really
want to get this out of my collection
it's not something I super enjoy and I
know this is something I'm gonna need a
project or just a push to really finish
it up so I want to put this in here and
just get it out really fast I think this
will probably be done maybe next update
if I really really use it but yeah
hopefully I can get through this pretty
fast and it'll just be like a thing out
of my collection I will put the price
somewhere so you guys can know how much
it is but it's pretty pricey okay those
are mine your picks that's my update on
the products that I have left to use and
all the products I already used up I'm
really happy with how this project is
going so far I'm also really happy with
how many people have joined in so I will
have as many people as I know are doing
this project link down below if you like
these you can definitely check them out
I'll be down there I know how it is

of like the same type of video so those
will be down there for your guys's
