Lauren this is going to be an update on
my finish 13 by Halloween let's just get
into it I have two new items that I
finished at ball to show you all the
other things really fast that I finished
up get to you on progress and then we're
gonna move in to picking two more items
which is awesome as always people will
be linked down below there also in this
project I'm sorry if I forget anyone I'm
doing my best
let's get into the update I've decided
to start separating my bags in like this
little one I think my eggs make up eight
does that like with our empties but it's
just keeping it so much more organized
it's so nice the first thing that's new
that I finished up this is the Korres
lip butter in Jasmine I love this stuff
I think it's so nice all the way gone
there's nothing in there you know I love
the smell of this I just love this
product in general I'm happy that it's
used up because it didn't go bad but I'm
sad at the same time because this was my
last one and the other item that I used
up was the Maybelline fit me concealer
this is in the shade light and it is all
the way gone I took the stopper out and
everything and it was just time to call
it quits oh I did I did pick up a new
one in fair you guys know my holy grail
ride-or-die concealer quickly quickly
we'll go through the other things I
finished up I finish up the by Terry -
Shiva Luce
that was my most expensive item the
Korres lip butter was in my lip balm
chapstick item the Maybelline item was a
staple everyday item I believe for a
bronzer I have the NARS Laguna mini and
as you can see there's something inside
it's all used up
I had the Mac prep and prime skin base
visage this was for my items that I
don't like I had six little mini perfume
samples to get through and all of those
are done and then I also had an item
I've already hit pan on and it was an
eyeshadow this is cracker but smh but
it's all gone it was a cream matte shade
and I think my eighth item because I'm
at a total of eight items used up or hit
pan on or whatever finished for my
project this is the Kat Von D star
studded palette and my goal was hit pan
on one shadow in here and I have done
that with this one here I also have been
continuing to work on this shade as well
as that shade but I have decided that
I'm gonna pass this along so you guys
have already seen my declutter video and
I'm going to put this in that stuff as
well I'm just I'm ready to pass this on
I'm ready to give it to a mom if she
wanted and just focus on different
shadows in my
collection than anything else in this
one and the palette was something that
I've never used before that's what that
one was
I had it for like at least a year and I
had never used it so let's get into
progress in no particular order this is
my NARS dual intensity eyeshadow palette
it's kind of messy so I apologize my
goal is to hit pan in one of these
shadows as well and I'm working on this
one here it has quite a big dip but as
you can see and as that just happened
this palette is definitely just I
dropped it and two of the shadows just
fall out luckily they've stayed together
but they fall out so I cannot wait to
hit pan or like you know whatever it's
not really a pan in here it's kind of a
baked formula so once I hit that like
grid I'm going to be passing this along
as well another one I'm really excited
on this is the Sephora and Pantone
universe blush palette it also has a
highlighter but you can see the dip the
dip is real I want to hit pan on this
highlighter here
this isn't item hadn't using it over a
year so I just wanted to bust it out and
get more progress on it but that's it
there I will insert a close-up of this
one as well but I'm so happy I
definitely feel like I'll hit pan on
this by next update I think that
highlighter is just a good solid
highlighter I really have been enjoying
it this is an item that was added to my
project last time and it is dot by Marc
Jacobs it's a perfume I started up on
this line and now I'm all the way down
here I've been using this constantly I
don't go light on perfumes it doesn't
matter if I'm trying to use it up or if
I'm just using it I like to spray a lot
of perfume on it's just how I spray
perfume so this will definitely be done
by next update as well I'm so glad that
I stuck this one in here because I do
like the scent of this it's just not my
favorite anymore and I'm glad to get the
use out of it and other people seem to
like it on me but it's just great to see
this actually move out actually get use
out of it and just kind of move on to
something new I feel like when you use
up some products that you've had a long
time that just seemed like such staples
in your collection that you can just
always remember them being there and now
I'm using this one up and it won't be
there anymore
it feels like I'm turning a new chapter
you know so anyway I'm excited to get
this one gone
is max sushi flour my goal is to hit pan
on this and this is my something pink
item there's still that dip going since
my hair is pink again I have been using
this a lot more in the brows and I do
like it I'm really hoping that if I keep
doing that I can hit pan on this that's
my goal I really really do want to hit
pan on this by the 31st this is
something that was put in last time this
is the pure correcting primer illuminate
and glow I am wearing this today it's a
nice primer actually it doesn't give you
too much luminosity but it's like more
like a lotion primer but it is nice I am
here I think I've used it like a couple
times I've probably started like about
here so yeah I feel like I'll definitely
get through that one I feel like this is
the item that is like giving me so much
struggle this project pan but this is
the tarte airbrush foundation powder
foundation i started up here with the
line hitting about here in the back I
started here started there and then now
I am to this line here so I am working
on this obviously that's a lot more
progress than in the past couple of
months so I'm really trying on this I
will be so happy when this is gone I
feel like this would be a great product
again if it was just in the right color
even just a lighter color I could make
it work better it's still going I'm
trekking through it I just can't wait to
get my money's worth out of this one
this was so expensive I think it's like
30 something dollars and I bought it
with the brush too so I just can't bear
to like not use this up but I'm almost
there so I'm excited to get this one out
definitely I'm really trying to not make
mistakes like that again with foundation
like getting wrong color but I don't
like it return it like get your money
back and try something else or get a
better color anyway next items this is
the tarte lipsurgence pencil and this is
in the color charmed not a lot of
progress honestly guys I I just with my
hair not being purple I don't like this
color as much I swear this this color to
me is like the color you put with like a
pastel purple hair really almost no
progress I'm still working on it and
trying my best I really should just make
myself wear this when I'm at home just
like keep reapplying at home but I just
haven't I've been using other things so
this is the benefit what's up
highlighter I'm wearing it today I've
been trying to remember to wear it as
often as I can I think from last updated
for knit two or three times and
the study progress mark there so I feel
like if I actually use this like even
for a whole week I would have way more
progress than I have but I do go pretty
heavy with this but again I'll do
close-ups but it's like why do you even
want a close-up of this I like to look
at all these little lines added up and
I'm like well I'm almost halfway done
that's pretty good so that's the way I'm
kind of motivating myself on this one
and the last two items are my like lip
and eyeliners so let me get the sheet
out this is the bite area lip liner in
Rose contour I'm definitely making some
good progress I'm wearing this as a lip
liner today I go back and forth with
loving this and not liking it I do like
it I like the color I just I go in phase
as you guys so this is it on my chart so
I'm now at the fourth line there from my
intro and those other ones this is where
I've started all the way up here so I
feel like that's a good progress
especially for a lip line or any guys
know how I am with lip products and I
definitely think again I can finish this
one if I keep using it and the other
little guy is so close to being done
this is my urban decay liner in roche I
added this in on the first update
because I picked this it wasn't a part
of the original group but now I am on
the third line there so I started all
the way up here in this project and now
within about like 2 months I'd say I'm
almost done with it so I feel like
that's amazing progress it's kind of
slowed down just because I got a couple
of their liners and I've been playing
with them but I'm really happy with this
this will definitely be done I feel like
my next update so I have a few things
that I definitely think I can clear out
and move on by the next time so now that
I have shown you guys all my progress
we're gonna go on to random gorg and
pick two new products to add into the
project BAM okay so out of 52 possible
categories we got the number 38 let's
see I already had that that was a tart
item so let's redo it number 52 the last
item I have not done 52 so that is
something orange so I will have to pick
something orange in my collection to use
you can do this however you want like
the packaging can be orange the product
itself but yeah something orange that's
kind of exciting and it's perfect for
fall and the next one was number 34 and
that is something a shimmery so I will
be right
I'm gonna go pick a two items and share
them with you guys okay guys I am back
I've chosen my two items so first first
shimmery this is just a little container
of a loose pigment from gorgeous
cosmetics I have its watch up here
hopefully you guys can see that super
shimmery super sparkly
my goal is T's with this entire pigment
we'll see how if that's possible not
sure if it will be but I do want to try
to use this like basically everyday and
just kind of create a signature look so
I'm going to be trying to use this up
the orange shadow I just decided to pick
from my modern renaissance palette and
this is the color real gir realgar and
it's the orange eyeshadow in here and I
just thought this would be really nice
for fall if you did it really light you
could like buff out a transition or you
can deepen it up and make your whole eye
that I just feel like it'd be a perfect
time to get a lot of use out of this
color so I just want to hit pan not use
up the whole thing so that's everything
guys I hope you enjoyed this update I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
and I will see you in my next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
