Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my finish 13 by Halloween
update - this is a rillette style
project pan I will have other people who
are doing this project pan listed down
below in the description box if you want
to watch other people it's been exciting
to see how many other people have joined
in which is awesome and let's just get
straight into this update I haven't
updated you guys in a while but I do
have some good progress last time I had
finished up 3 items so I got to pick 3
new ones and now on this time I have
also finished up 3 items so I now have 6
items down I'll go through those really
really fast so from last time I had
finished up my category a bronzer and
for that I chose the NARS Laguna it's
completely gone I also finished up a
complete eye shadow this was a product
I'd already hit pan on and it was just a
cream matte shadow and it's completely
gone and then this is a product I think
that I didn't like or hmmm let me see
what this product was yes this is a
product I just like and this is the Mac
prep and prime skin base visage I didn't
enjoy this primer I thought it felt nice
on the skin but it did have a lot of
glittery shimmery particles in it and to
me it just wasn't my favorite so I just
finished that up now on to the three new
items I finished up it's no surprise I
did finish up the six perfume samples so
the different ones I had in here this
one is dot by Marc Jacobs I do enjoy
this perfume I have it in the full-size
like the big full-size I can't wait to
get through it it smells good but it's
just not one of my favorites so I won't
worry purchase this is DKNY is be
delicious I think this is a nice perfume
as well I don't know if I'd purchased
this but it had it in a rollerball I
would enjoy it this is product candy I
did like this one this is one I might
keep on me or buy at some point in the
future it's sweet but a little bit more
warm which usually don't go that warm
but because it's so sweet I think it's
just nice I think it'd be a nice one in
like a daytime winter scent I do like
that one this is DKNY pure this is
definitely a cleaner scent it was okay I
enjoyed it I didn't hate it but I don't
think I purchased nothing like super
special this was Olivier Bell this was
just a little too warm to me it reminded
me of Victor and Ralph's a flower bomb
but not as like smoky smelling it was
okay
I can see why people like it it just
doesn't smell like me when I smell it so
I wouldn't repurchase that or like buy
it and then the last one is Victor and
Ralph's flower bomb this is one that I
can see why people like it but it just
doesn't smell like me I do have a
rollerball of this and I'll enjoy it and
use it up but I don't think I would
repurchase this scent either boot now
they have like a little mini review on
my perfumes let's move on this is the
item I actually picked last time I knew
I would be close to finishing this but
it did last a little bit longer than I
thought it would this is the bite area
to shovel loot a concealer and number
two it's like a brush tip concealer
nothing is in here and nothing comes out
anymore so I did finish that up I
enjoyed it I would not repurchase in the
last item that I did finish up for this
is the kat von d palette this is a
star-studded palette and this was the
product I think I've never used before
which is so sad but my goal is just to
hit pan on one of the eyeshadows and as
you can see I have hit pan so exciting I
was using my just Technic primer and put
it from my base of my lashes all the way
up to my brow bone I enjoyed it it was
quite bright though sometimes a little
too stark especially because I'm just
the tiniest bit darker because of summer
I have been using this one now to kind
of set that so I think I might try to
hit pan on that shadow and then other
than that I just I don't go the shadows
in here are really nice and that's part
of the reason like I just feel bad to
get rid of this but part of me thinks I
maybe should get rid of it I don't know
I might try to get a little bit more use
out of this we'll see I probably should
just pass it though right I don't know
but nonetheless I did hit pan and finish
that one so that's so exciting those are
my six items I've finished so let's get
into the progress on my other items
we'll start with this one I guess this
is the Korres lip butter and jasmine and
this was my lip balm chapstick item I
have definitely hit pan and expanded pan
and I'm getting close to being done so I
definitely think this one can be done by
the next update which is exciting I like
this I think it's really nice once I get
done with like all my lip balms I think
this is something that I definitely
would keep on me to have beside my bed
that's how I use it I do like it I love
the smell I like the way it feels and I
do like the color payoff too so I do
like this this is my no
dual intensity eyeshadow palette this is
something I regret purchasing I believe
and my goal again is just hit pan on one
of the eyeshadows in here and that would
be this one here I definitely have a dip
going I think that I can definitely hit
pan on this before the end of this
project
I don't know if I'm next update if I
really focus it on it and use it every
day maybe but it's exciting to actually
see some progress in this one and then I
feel like once I hit pan on that I might
like pass this on to my mom or something
too so I like this but it's just they're
not shadows that I just am gravitated
toward they're not even like none of
these are warm these don't look like me
if you saw this palette you would not be
like oh that's Lauren it's not it's not
me another really exciting item this is
the Sephora and Pantone universe blush
palette and my goal is to just use this
this is an item I haven't used in over a
year and I have really been focusing on
using up this highlighter I don't know
if you can tell but there's a lot of
shadow here because I am working on this
upper portion of the highlighter
I do enjoy this it's what I'm wearing
today plus I did put like a do a crumb
shadow over it a little but I do really
like this palette just in general I
think the colors in here really nice the
formula is really nice it's been a joy
to bust it back out so I'm excited to
hopefully hit pan on that highlighter
with this project I didn't think that I
would ever hit pan in this item at all
or use it as much as I have so it's been
nice to see some progress in this one
we'll just finish it up with the shadows
this is my Mac Suzy flower eyeshadow I
want to hit pan on this and this is my
something something pink I don't I have
used this a little bit not nearly as
much as I had the first like update
I have it in like the crease a little
bit today I definitely need to start
wearing this in my eyes and my brows a
little bit more and just work this into
more looks if I want to get through this
one but I definitely still think it's
possible I do like this one again like I
said before it's not the most pigmented
shadow ever but there's something about
it that is really nice especially for
crease work or in like the brows and
stuff so I do enjoy it and I definitely
think I can hit pan by the 31st this is
something that doesn't have a lot of
progress this is my powder foundation
from Tarte it's the Amazonian clay one
and light beige I do have a little bit
of progress on the lines here but that
is over basically since the beginning of
this project this is just still too dark
for me like I'm just not this dark I
bought this online I should have
returned it and I didn't so I think I'm
gonna have to like get another powder
and like crush it up and like make a
lighter foundation if I'm gonna try to
use this up which just seems like so
much work but I might do it I don't know
yeah I just it's too dark to really
actually use as a powder foundation and
I don't I'd rather look to light and add
bronzer than look too dark hopefully I
can figure out a way to use this because
it was expensive I have two pencil type
items in here not counting my tarte
lipsurgence
this is my pencil from Urban Decay that
I added in last time and there is so
much progress let's look at my little
sheet of paper here last update it was
this long from the bottom to the top
this was the Urban Decay pencil and now
it is only it's only that big how
exciting is that I didn't realize it
only took me that long to go through
these products so that is so exciting it
makes me feel really hopeful I can
finish up my other Urban Decay pencils
and I've really just been enjoying this
color it's very creamy
I do find I have to sharpen it after
about three uses when I use it a tight
line with it and just put a little on my
lower lash line like always but it's
exciting to be that far in like a month
I definitely feel like I'll finish this
and hopefully I can just like add
another one
or just get through another one I want
to try to get through like two more of
the urban decay ones this year hopefully
fingers crossed as for the other pencil
this is the by Terry lip pencil in Rose
contour I do enjoy this if you have a
little bit of progress on it as well
from last time obviously that new mark
where it's at is where the new progress
is I do enjoy this I think if you're
looking for a long-lasting lip pencil
this is totally you but I find that I
don't like this for the same reasons I
don't like liquid lipstick sometimes
it's like I just don't want something on
my lips stuck there you know I want
something that's a little more creamy or
that's not gonna wear away I just find
that sometimes with like long wearing
lip products you know the outer portions
of my lips don't get touched as much as
the inner and I just I don't touch-up
that's really the issue is I never touch
up so I don't want to look crazy the
whole day because I put this on anyway I
do like it the color is nice and I know
for a lot of people this would work it's
not about a formula it's just like a me
thing but I can't wait to get through
this I think there's only two more
things to update you on both of them are
busted because I'm getting too cocky and
excited to check my progress on things
so this is the benefit what's up
highlighter I know it's difficult to see
but I am down the tiniest bit basically
the same amount from the other marks
and I busted it off at the base so it's
holding on just barely I just get so
excited and then when I like try to roll
it down I like snap the base off and it
sucks I haven't been using this again
it's just not something I like to put in
my routine I definitely still want to
finish it and think I can finish it I
just need to use it ultimately obviously
I need to use it so I'm hoping that once
I kind of slow down and I have more time
to do my makeup in the morning when I
don't have to get to a shoot really
early or whatever I can try to actually
use this on like my cheekbones and stuff
underneath my foundation and get it gone
I'm not gonna lie I'm so jealous of all
the people who have panned that item
already and I wish I was them because
then I would be gone like that's how I
feel one more item let me go grab it out
of my purse oh my purse is right next to
me I was saying is that blacks item here
this is the tarte lipsurgence pencil in
charm not as much progress on this one
as there was before last time that makes
sense one because I haven't used it as
much but to the tip is gone so it's just
fatter
and again I think you can see totally
demolish I'm lucky I fit it back in the
tube I'm still gonna try to finish this
up even though it's a little busted I
definitely have progress on this for a
lip product I'm really excited about
this one and let's pick the new items I
get to pick three new items so excited
to be working on new things in this
project let's pick up okay so i've
random.org pulled up on my phone so
let's do this the first number I picked
was 31 which was a chapstick or a lip
balm I already have that one the next
item was number 9 let's see I have not
done that so number 9 is a perfume
that'll be exciting to work on next is
number 3 Oh early ones I like this
number 3 is a deluxe sized item I got
lucky there and then the last one is
number 36 I have a feeling I might have
used this already yeah a tart item I
already have that 46 something you want
to buy a full-size of ooh that'll be
interesting so I'm gonna go pick those
items and I will be right back guys okay
I am back I have picked out my items I
decided to just go with my dot perfume
for my perfume and be adventurous it's
so dusty sorry about that it's kind of
gross this is what I want to get through
by the end of the year like in my head I
don't think I made that an official goal
but I do want to get through it so it's
basically halfway done right now and
this is what I like to wear when it gets
a little bit cooler I'm just ranting up
this being on scarves for whatever
reason and I just want to get through
this so I thought this would be a
perfect time to force myself to use this
these were really hard to pick because I
don't have a lot of like deluxe sized
items and I feel like a lot of the stuff
in my collection I already either
repurchased and have the full size so I
don't have like a small size to get the
full size of it you know I don't get the
subscription boxes and bags and stuff so
for the item that I would like to buy
the full size up I decided to pick the
fresh sugar lip balms I love that lip
balm it's something that I definitely am
missing in my collection because I don't
have a full-size one right now and I
like the original one the best but I do
like the rose' ones so I want to try to
go through this this is the rosy
sighs lip-balm it's completely brand-new
so I want to go through that and these
can go bad pretty fast so I definitely
want to use this up while it's still
good and it is something that I have
repurchased and would definitely like to
repurchase in the future and my last one
for a deluxe sized item again I don't
have a lot of deluxe items like mostly
shadows blushes and bronzers right now
in my collection but this is the pure
correcting primer it's an illuminating
primer and I thought this would be nice
we'll see how it works I think I've used
this one time so just a small sample
size I go through primer pretty fast so
I don't think this will be any problem
at all
and those are all the items a 4-man
finished 13 by Halloween project pan or
LED update I hope you guys enjoyed and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
