Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to update you guys on my
finished 13 but Halloween this is my
first update so if you have to see in
the intro I will leave it linked down
below so you can check it out
I will also be inserting any pictures
that I have for progress on these items
I'm trying to be good with it I'm not a
hundred percent but I'm getting there
we're jumping straight into it so I'm
going to show you guys the most progress
I have and go from there so what I'm
gonna try to do so the first item that I
finished off is the Revlon Colorstay
under-eye concealer I really like this
product I think it's really nice but
these type of pen style click up
concealers suck when it comes to how
much product you get I run through these
just like it's nothing so I started here
and it clicked up as far as it clicks up
and that's it it's done I got this for
two dollars and some change at Big Lots
so price-wise I would repurchase it for
that price but I can't imagine spending
like $10 on it it would just like it was
pissed me off if I'm being honest the
next item I'm probably the most proud of
if that makes sense
I had to restate that like a million
times is my black opal powder it looks
like I have nothing left but I just have
a little bit of a ring around the edges
I'm going to repress this finish it up
I'm really excited to get this out it's
just taking up a lot of room with very
little product inside I've also made
really good progress on my first a
beauty coconut skin smoothie priming
moisturizer I really like the smell of
this I like to feel on the skin I don't
know if I repurchase this product or
anything but it's nice and I've been
enjoying using it up I started with it
full and now I'm about to hear I didn't
mark a line I'm really sorry but um I
feel confident by next update I will be
done with this product I really hope you
can't hearing it's a work going outside
sorry if you can but you know they don't
really care that I'm just trying to film
a YouTube video oh my gosh okay I
totally forgot that I hit pan on this
this is my Milani baked bronzer my goal
is just hit pan on this product I didn't
think it was going to come this bastard
probably would have thrown it in here
but I have it pan you can see the chair
caught a plate you'll definitely see it
in the pictures I'm so entirely happy
so I kind of just want to continue using
this and see if I can maybe use half of
it up I don't know just kind of continue
on on this
I'm so happy to hit pan I've had this
bronzer for a really long time I almost
feel like I have a love-hate
relationship with it too like sometimes
I really like it and then sometimes I'm
like I love orange and it's not blending
so I kind of want to use it up while I'm
a little bit darker while I'm into it so
that way I don't have to worry about
having it later on and not liking it
then I also have really good progress
pan I'm just I'm really good at project
panning no anyway I have really good
progress on my villain cream foundation
I have pan on this in the intro but I
just expanded it I'm definitely doing a
good job it's the foundation I'm wearing
today I feel like I made most of this
progress in the first two weeks of
starting this project and that kind of
moves on to other foundations but I'm
going to try to kind of get back to this
make some more progress I do like it and
again while I have a darker complexion I
need to try to use this up I also made
progress on my concealer from Maybelline
I started here now I'm there I do like
this product I think it works really
nice it's the peculiar have under my
eyes you don't need a lot of it so I
feel like Priceline especially compared
something like this you're just getting
so much more product for your money and
it's just going to lack you a lot longer
which is nice what you want I have two
powders here I really didn't use these
too much I maybe is the pure one once or
twice so there's not a ton of progress
but there's not much product in it so
I'm not really worried on this same with
the Revlon one I have hit pan I think I
hit maybe a little bit more pan but
again once I get that other powder out
and even the pure one I'll just focus on
this and it won't be a big deal I
definitely think I can finish it up I
have like a bunch of whiners here so
this is my white steel aligner it's
still going strong I'm going to keep
sharpening this until I can't sharpen it
any mo and I really like this I did buy
the color pop exit liner some people
were suggesting that in the comments I
broke so that kind of sucks like it will
ache okay
it broke off originally when I first
spotted but it just kind of resolved the
base those like I'll just
get back in there not a big deal then it
like broke in half like I'm telling you
I wasn't rolling you know if I wasn't
doing any of these weird project panic
things I was literally just trying to
use it took it out and like half of it
fell out so it's definitely not a good
replacement I will finish it up I don't
know if it's got a bad one but I'm going
to try something else
once that one's gone I don't think I'll
repurchase it anyway this is the urban
decay liner in 1999 I've been using this
a ton so I don't know if you'll see
progress I didn't take pictures of this
because I was just being lazy and I
don't know they're so tiny it's like I
know I'm gonna finish it we all want to
finish it it's not like we'll see it go
from a huge pencil to something tiny it
was already tiny and I'm just trying to
actually use it up and the last liner
that I have in here is from laura geller
this one is in the color brown sugar
definitely have left I am using this one
as well but I'm kind of putting priority
on the urban decay one just so I can get
it done and then I can focus on this and
for the last two items in this project I
have the Smashbox photo finish primer
haven't used this yet I'm kind of
focusing on the other one and then I'll
move on to this one so I'm not worried I
definitely think I can finish it there's
not been a product in it but I haven't
really touched it so far and then for
the alchemist palette from Kat Von G I
did use this quite a bit but I've kind
of not fallen out of love with it I just
haven't been using it as much as I was
at the beginning so I just need to bust
this out get inspired by it a little bit
more yeah it's nice you know I do like
this product you guys know I do
it just gives such a pretty look to the
eyes onto the face I just I go on phases
so I was in a holographic mode for a
couple weeks and now I'm not I'm into
something else but I'll go back to it
don't you worry now you have to use a
product I'm going to be adding a new one
in and I'm kind of added to products for
the prices one one is just a sample
packet and that's why I'm kind of adding
too because it's just like not a big
deal this is the bye bye redness but it
cosmetics I just got this as a sample
from Sephora order and actually want to
try it out and see if I like it so kind
of using
projects as a way to force me to use it
and then the item I'm going to try to
focus on is one from NARS I've had this
for a really long time it's just time
for it to go but I really do like it
this is rakubian and it was all our gift
like how many years ago about now just
don't tell me actually don't tell me it
doesn't smell bad or anything I'm
wearing it today I really do like it so
hopefully I can use this guy up or at
least make some good progress on it I'm
not good at using lip products like at
all so if I can make any decent progress
on this I will be happy that is
everything for my finished 13 by
Halloween I just want to say very fast
thank you to everyone who's joined in I
saw a lot of people tag me on Instagram
and I just saw it in the comments and
different things so thanks so much it's
always fun I don't know why I love this
project so much it's a big one with a
lot of items but there's something about
just how long it is and I don't know
it's going into like holiday I just have
good memories with this project so I
wanted to say you loved everyone who has
joined in and it's doing this project
