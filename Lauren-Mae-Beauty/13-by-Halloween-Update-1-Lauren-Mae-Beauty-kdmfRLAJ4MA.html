sorry about the glasses but it is nice
to see in like some of my videos since
I'm seriously so blind like on my
license I have to have my glasses on in
the car or I could get in trouble if I
got pulled over like I'm legit blind so
we're just going to deal with it so that
I can see and not have a headache after
this video this is going to be my
finished 13 by halloween update I'm
going to try to do my updates a little
bit more often because you guys want it
so I'm gonna try to do like every three
weeks or so so let's get into it this is
where I'm at with my progress and I'm
gonna try to get two more updates in
before my finale the first thing that I
had was my covergirl stay fabulous
outlast foundation concealer
three-in-one thingy this is in the color
8 10 and I remember why I stopped using
this and that was because the pump broke
in my intro I don't think I marked this
item because it was kind of hard to tell
where I'm this odd because of how the
product was sitting so I de potted it
into this little jar and I really could
not get much so that's all I have in
there it's maybe four uses for me at
least so I will definitely be finishing
this I went through this I tried to
scrape the heck out of this I really
want to get one of those little like
spatulas that I rubber but like for
makeup so that i could get everything so
hopefully i'll get one of those soon so
that if this ever happens again i can
just like easily get in there and
squeegee all that product up but um
great progress on this i'm going to be
done definitely by the next update next
I have my two stila eyeliners I put
these in as one item so one of them is
in the color teak I believe that is this
one is a brown one and this one's
bearing I've made no progress on berries
so on the line there when i roll the
product up that's how far i am and i
have again made no progress and then for
this one if you can see those little
lines i have may just the tiniest bit of
progress now the reason i've only made
that much progress is because in my
other project pan that I'm doing right
now I have another one of these
eyeliners that's in the color i believe
it was lilac and i finished that up
finally so I kind of was waiting to
finish that up before I'm done to this
one just to kind of keep things
systematic but just to show you to prove
it to you guys that I'm not far that's
it up against the cap so I feel good
about the progress on this I'm hoping to
have this done by the next time I update
you guys and then beyond to bury but if
not I definitely think I'll still finish
this within the time frame of getting it
done by the end of Hull end of Halloween
the end of October man I have like so
many I so much good progress on these
projects that I've been doing lately
it's really been inspired me to do a
couple other ones so um I hope it's
doing the same for you but my next
couple of videos will be more project
pan type of things because I just i'm
actually using stuff up and it's so
awesome to see it but my Maybelline
concealer this is the dream looming in
the color ivory on my first update i was
down here on the mark and now i'm all
the way up there and honestly i don't
know how many more twists i have left on
this which is so awesome and it's just
one of those ones that i've really liked
but it goes so fast like i think when i
had filmed my first update this I barely
had used any of it and it's only been
like about a month and I'm already like
finished with it so if you get these for
like the ten dollars or whatever that
they retail for I don't think they're
worth it but I like to get mine on all
cosmetics wholesale for like three
dollars and then I'll buy a couple of
them out of time now that's an ok price
for me like three dollars a month but
nine dollars is just too much even the
buy one get one half off that's still
like fifteen dollars for to which i
think is a little pricey for how fast
you go through it but i do love it and
I'm almost dead this is my little steal
a CC cream sample I am almost done with
this I probably a gun only have like
three uses I do use this in combination
with the covergirl foundation just
because this doesn't give me enough
coverage right now I have a lot of acne
scarring and a couple like active
breakouts so I need definitely need more
than like CC cream coverage so I'll use
both of them together and it really
works well I've actually
liked this pretty decently i don't think
i'd buy at full size but i kind of
thought this would be one of those ones
i like oh I don't want to do but it
hasn't been that bad so I really been
liking that and I'm almost done again
boom it feels so good I have my
georgeanna fab you bro this is all I
have left of it and I will show you the
markings on the paper this was my line
so at the first update I was all the way
up there and now when I hold it to the
bottom I am at the new black mark there
so lots of great progress this is one of
the ones that isn't that hard to get
through because I do use it every day
and I really like this pencil I'll
probably repurchase it and just have it
in my collection at all times because
it's just like I think it's seriously
199 and I get compliments on my brows
all the time at work we only sell like
high-end products and people ask me what
I'm wearing like all my makeup but
they'll ask me and I just like of Jordan
like I like barely say anything because
I don't want to tell them because i'm
trying to sell them honest oh yeah i
think it's definitely a good value and
honestly i have been enjoying like
thicker pencils or regular sized pencils
not just the really thin ones lately
because i have so much area to fill and
it just takes so much more time with the
smaller ones and i feel like i can get
all these are a different product but i
feel like you can get a pretty precise
brow or something that i'm totally fine
with with just the pencil next I have my
highlighter from bareMinerals now this
is in the color the love affair I love
this highlighter it's so pretty and I
hope you guys can see the dent in the
center there that is what I'm trying to
hit pan on that's all I want to do with
this hit pan by Halloween so i've been
using this a lot I go pretty heavy on my
highlight lately because I kind of want
to just like see that pan but i also
just really like the way this looks it's
just a really good highlighter it's not
too stark like white or anything so i
feel i can go a little heavier and it
still looks natural so well not natural
but like not crazy I guess now for the
one item I finished up i did finish
something this was my korres lip butter
in the color guava there is nothing
there I used all of it up my last use
was last night so I'm really happy to
see another one of these got that's my
second one I've used up this year which
is super exciting so just want to keep
working on getting the rest of the ones
I have left of those out this is my
Willetta i think is how you say I got it
in France again that is where I started
and that's where I am I wanted to finish
up the Korres one before I started this
one because I'm gonna use it in the same
way at night before I go to bed I will
be starting on this I think that this
definitely can get done and have two
months basically to use it and it's not
even half so i think i will do okay on
this next I have this little tiny guy
this is my Elizabeth ma I'll shadow
stick or whatever it is it's like an
eyeliner though so tiny this is also
like starting to rip off tues and I have
to rip it off to like sharpen it to
actually grip it so I definitely think
I'll have this finished by the time
Halloween comes but when we look at it
on the paper again I was at the color
line now i'm at the black line so lots
of great progress this one moves a
little bit slower just because i only
use it really on the inner corner but
it's moving i'm definitely still
sharpening it and I don't sharpen it
every time because they don't like waste
the product but it's going another lip
balm in the project is my fresh sugar
honey lip balm now i'm really happy
because they've made a lot of progress
so i started up here now i'm down here I
had another one of these that I used up
in a project in the Rozier's like flavor
color I don't know but like I didn't
finish it quite in time or I used it at
the very end and so I'm really happy to
see this one going forward if you missed
it that was me like proving to you the
product I'm really happy I'm almost done
I'm hoping to get it done by like the
end of sep tember so that means it'll be
done like on month early that's my goal
on it specifically but I've been using
it just like every day in the morning
before I leave and then throughout the
day i'll be using my baby lips and it's
been working well for me
right now as well this is my fresh sugar
lip polish and I don't know why but I
did not show you guys where I was on
this one I was basically a hundred
percent full I'd only use it like three
times and now I tried to come trying to
clear it all the way down so you can see
the rim I've definitely been using it I
try to use it every single night and
then I've also been using it on my
cuticles because this is a scrub but it
also kind of has like a moisturizing oil
type to it so I thought it'd be really
moisturizing on my cuticle so usually
once a week i'll try to use it on my
cuticles and just like get some extra
moisture and i've been liking that as
well i'm not trying to like waste this
product but it is not one of my favorite
one so trying to find alternative ways
to use it without completely like
wasting it is definitely something I'm
trying to do this one if I use it every
single day and keep doing that um I
think I can make it but just barely this
is my color pop I shadow and lovely
honestly I've only used this I think
once maybe twice so this is something
that I am struggling with I really need
to step it up and use this more often my
goal is to use it like twice a week but
this is not gonna be finished there's
just no way it's a lot of product and
honestly I just haven't been wanting
like seriously of glittery I that's all
this is is like glitter it's beautiful
when I do use it but it's just not an
everyday eyeshadow for me right now like
what I'm into so it's been a little bit
of a struggle to wear it so I'm just
going to keep pushing through I just
want to try to use it twice a week and
at least see progress on it and I'm
going to try to like work just one way
down so we can kind of see the progress
and last for my project I have my bare
minerals concealer in the color bisque
now this has been an item that's been
difficult for me to use again it's been
another projects it is just not easy to
use so how I have been making progress
on this I guess I'll show you honestly I
have like whatever's in the cap here I
have that times maybe to like whatever's
in the cap is also in the bottom part I
did try marking it on like the back here
with little marker but it's just too
hard to get the product and actually see
it that way so hopefully that was enough
for you guys to see I'm hoping to have
this finished
the next update I'm just gonna kind of
like go a little heavy with it let me
finish what I the thing i have been
using this underneath my makeup so put
my primer on and then I'll go in with
this with like a duo fiber tiny little
brush I'll dip it in there and I'll
start like covering and concealing any
of the red scarring that I have from my
acne or just any red spots in general
and I'll kind of cover those areas and
then I'll go in with my Beauty Blender
and my foundation or whatever that I'm
using for the day and I find that this
really cancels out the red I don't have
to use as much foundation it doesn't
have to look as cakey I guess and it's
been working pretty well this is a
little bit darker than my skin tone but
for some reason because I'm covering it
with the foundation you can't really
tell it it works so that's how I have
been getting through this and that's how
I'm going to continue to work through
this until it's gone that was a lot of
items I hope you guys enjoyed this
update again I'm going to be trying to
update you guys every three weeks or so
just so you guys can see the progress a
little bit more and i haven't flying
through these items so it's exciting
it's actually like it'll actually be
exciting to update you as i move through
these because it's so often and if
you're into these look forward to a
couple more of my videos that are going
to be coming up because they will be
focused on around project panning and
one's going to be kind of like a series
i do every month so i hope you enjoyed
this I'll see you my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
