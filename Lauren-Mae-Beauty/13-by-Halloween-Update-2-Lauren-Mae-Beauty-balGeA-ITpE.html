channel this is going to be I believe my
update number two for my finished 13 by
Halloweeny let's just get into it I have
some really great progress I can't wait
to share with you guys and you're really
excited for it the products that I'm
showing aren't like in any order at all
so yeah they're just in a list that I
made a long time ago and that's him
going through them so it'll be a
surprise if I used to have perfect first
things I have our first thing I have
this covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation this is upside down and this
is backward oh my gosh oh I have
finished this up so in my first like
project I started with this and then I
had to move it into this container
because the pump broke and then now this
is completely used up so I can see in
there there's no product I got in there
with my sponge I got in there with my
fingers like used up every last drop I
will say as I use this product I did
really enjoy it I'm not sure about color
match and like oxidation throughout the
day how it looked but coverage wise I
really really like this so I will
potentially repurchase this once I go
through more stuff but it's gone I feel
really good about that although I do
kind of miss it because it is a really
good foundation from the drugstore or
looking for something with really good
coverage the next items on my list were
from Stila they were the two liners now
I am counting these as one and the brown
one is first so you can see I hope you
can see the little lines there I feel
like I look short in this thing also I
have a new lighting let me know how you
like it I have like this one I feel like
I look like I'm gonna filter or
something but let me know okay in a bad
way there like I tried to like make
myself look pretty on an Instagram photo
or something okay so that's where I'm at
on that one and there's three marks I'm
at the bottom mark on that so not much
left I'm hoping by the next update but I
don't have any issues with using this
one up for short and then the other one
that one is in the color cheek this one
is in the color berry and I have used
actually a little bit of this I was
using it for different looks
my eyes underneath and smudging it so
that's where I'm at just a little bit
lower not a ton of progress but I really
haven't been consistently working on
this one I am hoping that I can get this
one done I'm gonna just focus on the
brown one just to clear it out and then
only be using this one toward the end
but I still feel really good that I can
finish this up by Halloween as well I
don't know if I like the lighting or the
angle or something like some things
weird right let's keep going um I have
my Maybelline Dream Lumi and ivory I am
completely finished up with this it
doesn't twist up anymore I really like
this product although I do think it is
crazy for how much products you're
getting and how fast you go through it
so if I buy any more of these it will be
because they were like three or four
dollars that's the price I'll get them
and I think they're worth that but
they're not worth $9 or $10 they're not
worth buy one get one half off or
anything so yeah that's my feelings on
that one but I do really like it and
it's good next on my list I have my
steal a CC cream little sample it's
completely gone as well I was using this
in conjunction with the covergirl stay
fabulous foundation that's what that's
called and kind of thinning it out that
way just to get through this sample and
it's gone I did actually really enjoy
this though I thought it worked well I
probably wouldn't repurchase it I don't
even know if they make this or or what
but it was good and then he's done I
don't know if you guys can see this here
but this is my Jordana fab you brown I
am so close to being done I have the
tiniest little nub here left I really
like this pencil I get compliments all
the time on my brows at work which again
I mentioned that before feels really
weird cuz it's like oh yeah it's a 299
or a dollar 99 pencil from the drugstore
buy this one that's like 20 dollars but
um I do really like this I really like
the color of this pencil I'll swatch it
for you guys actually that's it there
and I don't know what it just looks so
weird on the screen so I have no idea
what the color looks like for you guys
but it is a nice pencil it's not too
ashy and it's not too warm it's just a
really good taupe color for people that
have blonde hair or like light light
brown hair
I just like it so let me show you
progress wise on my paper so you can't
even see that I might just stick like
this for the video let me know which one
you like better so that's where oh so
hard that's where I that's where I am
now and I am I started at the top of
that line there so lots of progress I
feel like I I've made steady progress if
you look down at the marks just working
through that just natural use on this
one and I feel like I was sharpening it
a little bit more toward the end only
because I was wanting like I just a
little bit more thin brow tail at the
end so having a thinner pencil I needed
to sharpen it more I would potentially
repurchase this once I work through
other brow products I have it's just a
good one to have it's a good one to know
that if I really needed to skimp on a
pencil I didn't have a ton of money that
this one could do the job for me
next is my highlighter from bareMinerals
this is in the color the love affair and
I you can kind of see you can see the
dip definitely in it I am working on
this product I am using it on my eyes as
an eye shadow as well with a more dense
brush just to try to hit that pan so bad
I'm telling you guys all my little
secrets here but I've been using this on
my face it's the highlight I have on my
cheeks and like everywhere on my face
today and I do really like this
highlight it's a very as much as its
shimmering it's still subtle because of
color it's not too stark and cool toned
it's not golden II though either it's
just a really good toned highlight I
really like it and I'm continuing to
work on this I cannot wait it pan though
cuz I just have so many other products
and I'm realizing that through my
project pans it's like I want to use my
other blushes I want to use my other
bronzers I want to use mother highlights
and right now I'm kind of stuck with the
same things until I hit pan but I am
going to continue using this until I hit
pan but I just can't wait for that
moment when I can just really have fun
and explore my collection so my camera
shut off awesome alright sorry guys I
had to take a break for a second cuz the
camera was dying like every 4 seconds so
hopefully we can make it through this
video I was talking about the high
anyway I'm excited to use new products
there's a firkin fly in here like I feel
like it was just born which sounds
really nasty but there wasn't a fly
another is a fly and none of my windows
or anything or open what differ anyway
so let's go on to other products I'm
done talking about whatever tangent I
was talking about next I have I'm
looking at my sheet I have the Korres
lip butter in guava I finish this
product up in my last update so it's
still finished so that's good and I
moved on to my Valletta one which we'll
talk about next that is this one here so
progress wise you can see the little
marks I'm about halfway done with the
product I started off originally with so
I feel good about that
I use this every night before I go to
bed I don't think I'll have any problems
using it up since I've only been using
it probably I don't know like I'm three
weeks a month
since I finished up this last one maybe
a little bit more but I think that I
definitely can finish this by the 31st
of October okay next I have my Elizabeth
Maud shadow stick and pearl it is also
so so tiny the cap is a way bigger than
its itself it's like half its size so
that is all I have left there is like
nothing nothing left it lost the end
part I was keep you can't even see it
my fingers are better that's so awkward
anyway that's all I have left on the
paper which is always so difficult for
me to do um that's all I have left of it
so I can see myself being done with this
really soon I'm trying really hard not
to push it into the cap too far because
it'll just be gone forever and I'm
continuing to use this up so again no
problems I don't think to finish this by
October 31st next is a lip balm from
fresh this is an ascent color and the
color honey this is it here oh my gosh I
have the markings on the side so I
started up here and then last update I
was there and now I'm just a little bit
farther past that definitely slower
moving this last you know update but I'm
still working on it I you
it quite often almost every day at least
three four times a week again I'm just
ready to move on to something else so I
need to just use this but I think I'll
finish it by October it's just one of
those things that I just want to wear
other lip products I'm excited I'm
thinking about doing the 30 day lipstick
challenge where you wear a different one
every single day I thought they'd be a
fun way to like just try out different
things in my collection one just be
inspired and have fun but also like if I
don't like something on my lip so it's
an opportunity to get rid of it because
I tried it so anyway back to this I am
gonna definitely finish up October but
it's a little bit slow going at the
moment oh my gosh the camera is like
staying on I can't believe it I have
another fresh product here this is the
lip scrub I'm not gonna lie to you guys
there is more progress in there it's
dipped down more I have not used this on
my lip so I've just been using it as a
hand scrub I just don't like it I don't
I don't like this product on my lips and
I just dread using it that way so
instead of forcing myself to use it in
that way although it is you know I use
more product up I still try to be as
like little product as possible so I
don't waste it I'm not trying to just
like clump all this on and just get rid
of it but I you know I'm totally fine
with using it as a hand scrub right now
because I don't want to force myself to
use it on my lips it would take me 7
million years and I don't want to deal
with that and I'm still getting use out
of it I'm still it's still a useful
product my hands are being scrubbed and
moisturized but it's not as like just
dreadful to me so that is how I'm gonna
use this up and I probably have though
like even using it that way the small
oil container probably have like 5 to
like 8 uses in here minimum so I think
that's a good but good thing so um you
know I just want to let you guys know
how many is that because I just can't be
bothered with the whole of their using
on my lips I just I just don't want to
and so that's how many is that my color
pop eyeshadow and lovely eye
I've used a bit more of this I don't
know you can definitely see a little bit
more pan I was using this in my final
four school for my high fashion class
that's I used this as part of the eye
shadow that's the reason that there's
more gone that's really all I've used it
as it's just sparkly I'm I'm always
tempted to buy more color pop shadows
and it's not that I don't like them I
think that they're great but I just
don't use them so I really I'm gonna try
out to buy anymore definitely I just
feel like they dry up yeah I think the
five dollar price tag sometimes like
makes me want to like get seven hundred
of them because oh they're only five
dollars but I just don't always want
this type of product and they do dry out
since they're like a cream type of
formula and honestly I just think powder
ones that for your money lasts so much
longer I don't know I'm not trying to
hang I do like these and I understand
why people buy them just on a personal
note on something that I'm realizing
with myself I don't know if I'm gonna
buy any more of these so anyway that's
where I am on that one I don't think I'm
gonna finish this up by October I don't
think that I'm going to use it anymore I
don't know if I get inspired I'll keep
it in my drawer but I'm not gonna put
pressure on myself to use this because I
I don't want to wear like glitter on my
eye I'm not gonna do it so anyway that's
my thoughts on this product but I don't
think I'm gonna finish it up so yeah
this is the last item this is from
bareMinerals
it is their multitasking concealer and
bisque I have actually not made much
progress on this since last time because
my skin has cleared up so although it
said it is a good thing that there is no
use really for this product anymore it's
too dark for my skin tone I'm trying my
best to use it I'm gonna really try hard
to use it up by the time October 31st
comes around because I just want it gone
and I've made so much progress on it I
would hate to like pass it along at this
point because you know I want to finish
it but I was using it to cover like any
of my scars before going on in with
foundation and it was
being all for that but now that it's too
dark I don't know I might try maybe
doing like a light dusting all over my
face for some coverage and then going in
with my correct color
I don't know I'm gonna play around with
it again to see how I can make it work
for me I I just want it to go though I
don't want to pass it so I really want
to focus on trying to find a way to make
this work just to use it up just to get
it done that is everything for my update
