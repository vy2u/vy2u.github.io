channel it's Lauren thank you so much
for watching today marks a video that's
going to be a first in a series this is
going to be a makeup artist series if
you are new to my channel and you
haven't watched any videos from me
before hi and Lauren I'm a pro makeup
artist I live in LA and I work full time
freelancing as a makeup artist it's like
what I do I thought it would be fun to
make this video to talk about some
products that I keep in my kit that
aren't makeup related that I think are
just essential I've picked out 15 things
in a kind of a lot but I really do think
that these are important now every set
is different what you're doing is
different if you're working like a
fashion show these might not apply you
if you're working on a movie set some of
these might not apply to you because
there's a costume light you could be
working on a TV set where the crew isn't
as big or working on like a bridal
client everything is different so not
all these are going to apply to every
situation but I find that I like to keep
all of these items in my set bag which I
will show you in a second and I just
feel like I am very very prepared for
any situation that would come up and
honestly I feel like that's one of our
number one job is makeup artist to make
sure that we are prepared for any
situation I love taking care of my
talent I love making them feel
comfortable I love making their jobs
easier for them so that's one of my
number one concerns but I also like to
have some products for other people
crew for the director for just anyone
else who might need something I like
being that go-to person who is just
prepared for anything I'm basically the
girl that's ready for the zombie
apocalypse at all times if you want to
know what I keep in my kids that I think
their must-haves that our non makeup
related then just keep watching these
are in absolutely no particular order
but the first item I want to talk about
is keeping straws on hand now I know
this looks kind of like a janky bag I
switch my bag up every like month or so
just so it doesn't look gross but I keep
straws in this bag I reach for this all
the time this is probably one of the
number one things so maybe it is in a
little bit of an order when you're
working on a client and it's a woman and
they have stuff on their lips you don't
want to be touching up their lip a
million times and in my
and crafty does not always have straws
so it's like expected of you to have
straws in your kit you could definitely
do pre wrap package straws if you wanted
to but this works totally fine I've
never had any complaints and I keep it
very sanitary
so I highly suggest keeping shelves in
your kit you will definitely impress the
people that you're with they will know
that you are a serious and working
professional makeup artist and next to
have a few items that are in my kind of
skincare section of my kit this is
similar to like a Zuka bag but this
one's from still ozzie and it's just a
clear case you can see everything that's
in it I keep my skincare moisturizers
just anything of that nature in this bag
I can definitely do a whole video going
through this if you want me to but I
have a few things from that bag that is
essential that I think you definitely
should have one of those items is
eyedrops these are the Visine advanced
redness and irritation relief I didn't
have these in my kit for a really long
time and luckily all the times it came
up I was working with another makeup
artist if she has eyedrops but then it
definitely something you should keep in
your kit I'm so glad I've had these
these come in handy when someone might
have something in their eye when an
actor's eyes are red and they want to
try to like calm any redness they might
have for on-screen I also feel like this
is helped more with like crew or extras
or just anyone who's having eye
irritation they come to me they say hey
view of eye drops I'm like yeah I do I
just like to sanitize the tip of this
with alcohol every time someone's used
it just to kind of keep it as sanitary
as possible but this is definitely
something that I've had multiple people
come up to me asking me about happy and
I'm always so happy when I can say yes
you want to be a yes man on the other
items happen to do with the eyes as well
but we're talking about the under eye
here first you definitely should have a
kind cream on you taking care of people
skin is an essential part of being a
makeup artist it starts with the skin
and obviously you're going to have
moisturizers and things like that but I
definitely think an eye cream it doesn't
have to be crazy expensive but something
that's specifically designed to go under
the icig of hydration is very important
people will come into your chair
expecting you to make them look
beautiful when they have done nothing to
help themselves look beautiful they
haven't had water in days they stayed up
all night drinking they've got
no sleep and an ice cream just really
helps moisturize that area just give you
a little extra tool to make them look a
little bit better and just give some
hydration to that products that you put
on top of it are going to lay nicer and
hopefully look better and the other item
I have for combating any type of like
puffiness or anything like that under
the eye are eye patches these ones are
from pathology I did get these from
Oxley but these are great to keep in
your kids again
some people like to party they like to
drink they like to have a good time or
maybe they just didn't get a lot of
sleep they're working really hard either
on another job or whatever the case may
be and these are just a great way to not
only pamper your clients but to actually
help reduce any swelling or any
puffiness they might have underneath the
eyes so that way you can make your work
look better and they can look better on
screens I will put these on while I do
like their upper I like their eye brows
and their eye makeup on the top and then
I will take these off and do the rest of
their face this might not seem like it's
a must-have it might seem like a luxury
items but when you are in a situation
where you really need to combat
something that you know we normally
can't we can't really do anything about
texture these come in handy so much I
love them I actually forgot that I
didn't show you my set bag so I thought
it would just show you it now so getting
it all in screen is kind of hard but
this is the bag that I keep on set with
me so this isn't all my makeup this is
just what I carry around with me that's
attached to my hips that has everything
I might possibly need on a second notice
to touch someone up right before they go
on screen I'll do last looks to do any
of that type of stuff and most of the
stuff I'm mentioning right now kind of
lives in here some of it I don't need
that on hand I just like to have on set
at some point like in my room or
wherever with me but I definitely
suggest this bag I'll have it linked
down below I love that it's clear you
can kind of keep yourself organized but
you can also see everything that you
have anyway I thought I would just
mention this and show this before I move
on to the next item because I think this
is definitely an essential to house all
the stuff I'm coming this next grouping
of items as one thing because it kind of
all go together but technically it is
three different things and these kind of
all fall into the realm
of wardrobe so if you aren't a big set
and there is someone who's doing
costumes you will not need to use any of
this stuff
and don't let them do their job but if
you were on a set guys like more low
budget or you're kind of like someone
that does everything I definitely work
on a lot of those that are like
non-union and these definitely come in
handy so the first one our nipple covers
these ones are from Hollywood is that
the brand I think that's the brand and
these are just nipple covers so that way
if you know someone needs their nipple
covers you got them covered literally
that kind of speaks for itself we all
know what that guys I also suggest a
little mini lint roller this one is just
tiny you can probably find these at like
the dollar store or just I feel like
most places you can find these if you're
looking for them again a lot of these
items as much as they come in handy
whenever the occasion arise it just
makes you look so professional you don't
want to be the person that's always
being like oh no I don't have it
oh no I don't have that you want to be
the person that comes like man I know
you're not supposed to have this but do
you happen to have a blank and you're
like oh yeah and they're like wait what
that's what you want to be and so I
definitely suggest a little mini lint
roller and then the last thing here this
is a fashion taste again from the brand
Hollywood it's basically just
double-sided sticky tape I find that
this comes in handy if you're trying to
like cover someone's bra or maybe their
cleavage is showing too much you can
obviously get creative it's tape so you
could use it in any way you could use
tape but it specifically works on
clothes really well and I do use this a
time and this comes in handy in case
someone just needs some like last-minute
weird little tweaks you are prepared
number five is something that again it's
just kind of a category that has a lot
of things in it it takes up a whole
pocket in that bag I showed you there's
just one dedicated to oral hygiene we've
got it all kids I like to be really
prepared when it comes to anything that
has to do with the mouth or breath or
anything like that so I'm going to show
you I have mints here these are great
because they dissolve so it's not like
gum it's not going to be as long-lasting
so if you're actor or actress just want
something right before they go on so
they can easily chew up or whatever and
get out of their mouth mints are perfect
gum is obviously a longer lasting
solution to bad breath either for
yourself when you're working on clients
I know it can seem like chewing gum
while you're doing someone
makeup is like gross but it's kind of
the opposite way if you were chewing gum
and your breath smells nice it's way
better than if your presence disgusting
and you're breathing on people's face so
mint and gums these are must-have I even
have like mint options because I'm I'm
psycho like that so you can do whatever
you feel is necessary I also highly
suggest sloths and I have some like
little toothbrush things these are the
placards I just got this at the dollar
store I believe but they're just little
floss picks on set if you're working
like a 12-hour day
you obviously have lunch and it's your
job is to make farts to make sure they
don't have stuff in their teeth before
they go on to part of your last list
it's part of what you do if someone does
have something in the teeth how are they
going to get it out you got to have
something to help them get that out we
don't want yzma up in here
I haven't suggest these they're just
easy I think I usually keep a little
mini floss as well but these are
sufficient enough you don't need to have
bowls and then this is something I get a
bit lost I've already used one of them
but it's a mini toothbrush it has a
little ball in it that like lets out
some like mouthwash really great if
someone is on set all day maybe doesn't
bring their toothbrush a lot of actors
do but if they don't and they just want
to like kind of clean up their teeth
feel fresh and you know that feeling of
just like nice clean teeth this will
give it to them it's easy
disposable cheap I believe you get four
of them for a dollar fifty or something
super super great deal definitely comes
in handy and it's worth the investment
and last for oral hygiene something I
don't even have in my kit right now coz
I ran out but little mini scope or
mouthwash bottles are great to have on
hand I recently did a short film where
we have some puke situations going on
planned puke just to clarify
but afterwards you know it he just
wanted something to be fresh pout so I
had some mouthwash that he could use
just kind of rinse his mouth out get
back to normal and not feel like he
still had that fake puke in his mouth
you know so I highly suggest having nose
you can get those up the dollar store as
well number six we're moving on to some
things that I just like to be prepared
for because when you're filming
sometimes you're not just inside a house
you're out in the elements and you need
some items to help protect potentially
you or your actors so I highly suggest
having an umbrella on hand this is going
to protect you obviously from the rain
but if you're working in the desert or
you're working somewhere where it's
going to be sunny you
put this on your actors and make sure
that they're not getting sunburned make
sure that you're not getting sunburned
production it usually has umbrellas if
it's a situation like that but just in
case you can be prepared and protect you
and your actors on top of that I also
have a posture on my kid and this one
actually was already taken out it wasn't
used but I had multiple Poncho's and we
use them because the rain just started
coming down
and it's great for like extras and stuff
I get mine for a dollar I think I got
them at Big Lots but just having a few
Poncho's on you again it's so refreshing
the producers are always really happy if
you have things like this that you know
maybe no one else is thinking of that
you have you're definitely going to get
hired again let me tell you hopefully we
can start moving through some of these a
little bit faster I know this video is
probably going to be a little bit long
so maybe take it in sections I don't
know this is not something I have on me
but I think it's important to kind of
get to know your actors and have some
snacks in little things in your bag
crafty usually has their whole setup so
if you know that maybe your main actors
really love SunChips and you see some
Sun Chips maybe snag a bag put it in
your set bag because you are always
around actors that's your job
wherever they go you go when they aren't
needed on set you're not needed on set
you are there for them so I like just
having little snack little treats or
whatever in my bag so maybe in between
cakes if there's kind of a long set up
or working in a trailer with them or in
their holding with them I can be like oh
hey here's this or if they say something
I have something to offer them I think
it's just an extra little thing that
puts you above and beyond and I really
enjoy doing that just personally I like
you know being there for people and
helping them out next I got a list is a
lighter now lighters come in handy let's
say someone needs a light a candle on
set and no one has something you got a
lighter I mean art would normally have a
lighter if that was the case but you
know if you're working again on some of
these smaller sets that don't have a
huge crew it's so great for you to just
be helpful in as many ways as possible
lighters also come in handy when it
comes to challenge if they smoke or
anything like that you have a lighter in
case they don't have one on them or they
forgotten it or misplaced it you can
help them out and give them a lighter it
is a sharpie sharpies are great because
you might need to label something you
might need to write on something these
work on like any type of surface you can
all
label your water bottle because on set
everyone has like a million water
bottles laying around so sharpies are
just a great tool to have the next item
on the list is a body sprite or some
type of like rim spray or something
that'll make something smell good it can
be hard to pick out a scent because you
don't know if it's going to suit
everyone or whatnot but when the time
comes down and something needs to smell
nice that doesn't smell nice whatever
you have will work so this one is from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's pretty as a peach
and they have these like trial ones I
think they're like six dollars or so you
don't have to have bath and Bodyworks
you can have whatever you have on hand
but I love that this is just small it's
cute whatever
I've had these requested in situations
where crew is in a room and they're
filming in a room and it's tight and it
smells bad and it's like hot in there
this can kind of just be a little
refreshing mist throughout the room so
it doesn't smell as bad also in a
trailer you know you have a bathroom in
a trailer and maybe you want something
to make it smell a little nicer this is
what you want so this is definitely come
in handy at something I definitely like
keeping in my kit and that's just
something that might not apply to
everyone but if you're working on
something where you don't have a
separate hair and makeup artist you
might need this especially for
continuity so how does just having this
a disposable razor in a small can of
shaving cream I also have a whole men's
grooming kit so I have like an electric
razor but if you need something that's
close to the skin this is just a great
go-to I had a situation where it didn't
have this and it sucks and I felt
horrible so I definitely highly suggest
keeping these in your kid I keep
multiple razors I don't just keep one
but it's great that you just have one
you can throw away so just get a little
cheapy one it doesn't need to be the
nicest thing if it's a situation where
it's going to be reoccurring and you can
be using the same razor on the same
person it's a long shoot you can
definitely upgrade the razor for that
situation but you're just kind of just
like an oh shit
glad I have this type of product I feel
like the next thing is something that
gets overlooked a lot but nail polish is
something that we're in charge of as a
makeup artist as well so it's great to
have acetone on you so that you can
remove any polish if it's not going to
be in continuity with what's going on in
the scene maybe it's just like a one day
shoot but they don't really like that
they're wearing lime green nail polish
and they want something that's natural
or it's nothing
their nails or they might want something
that's new so happy acetone for removing
things acetone I'll say always something
that people use in makeup explication
when it comes to special effects but
anyway I also like to keep some new
polishes on hand I tried not to get too
crazy with the news or having too many
nail polishes but I try to have a range
that would work on multiple different
skin tones so the first one here this is
Neal whimsical from Essie this is
topless and barefoot from Essie and then
this last one here is fashioned from
Deborah Lippmann these are just neutral
something to have if nail polish is a
big part of whatever gig you're doing
you probably would already have had some
type of pre-production meeting and you
would already be prepared for that
situation so this is just in case at
least you have something on hand that
could handle a situation next it's
always great to keep deodorant in your
kit this comes in handy when it comes to
actors as a little just anyone on set
some people are like man I smell that
and I'm like here you go here's some
deodorant you're helping everyone out I
love it spray deodorants for my kid
because of sanitation nothing's touching
anyone's skin it's super easy you just
spray it on and someone smells good the
next item that I have on my list is
sunscreen this kind of goes with the
elements but sometimes you're out in the
Sun and it's your job to again protect
your actors and sunscreen will do that
most the time production will also have
sunscreen but if they don't you are
prepared and can you know help your
actors this is just a travel sized one
from Coppertone this is perfect for if
random land situation comes up but I
usually do carry a big bottle with me in
my like makeup room or in my more
stationary stuff this is also great for
like effects if you're looking for more
dewy skin or if you're looking for more
of a sheen on the skin sunscreen can
help give you that as well and can you
believe it guys we're already at number
15 and these are a parent of items the
first thing here are brown paper bags
and I also have tape I use these items
as a makeshift traps that I can take to
my makeup chair I have a chair that has
two side tables that pop up and I will
just open a bag tape it to the side and
it's just an easy way to have trash
easily accessible I can keep my station
as clean as possible even if I'm working
really fast you never know where you're
going to have to
I've had to set up in basements in
abandoned buildings I had to set up in
like graveyards like I've been in a lot
of different places and sometimes the
trash isn't in the room that you're
working on because you're not even
working in a room you're working beside
a palm tree at a pool so this is just a
great way to give yourself the luxury of
a trash it's easy
you're self-sufficient and again it's
just keeping your area nice and clean
and that's everything guys I really hope
this was helpful if you are an aspiring
makeup artist or a makeup artist and
you're looking for some tips and tricks
that are really just going to take your
kit above and beyond or if you're just
someone who is interested in like what a
makeup artist uses on set I hope this
was interesting in any way possible if
you have anything that you like to keep
in your kit if you are a makeup artist
or you think would be helpful to keep in
a kit let all of us know down below in
the comments and that is everything
thank you so much for watching guys and
I will see you in my next video fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
