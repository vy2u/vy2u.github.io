thought I would give you an overview
here of my makeup I used up for 2015
sorry the Lighting's not the best but I
did what I could we're just on my coffee
table here so I'm super happy with all
the makeup items I used up for 2015 I
believe I used up 78 makeup items and I
think my goal is to use up 75 so I hit
that plus three which is amazing and I
think what's really remarkable is if I
hadn't done a bunch of project panning
this year I don't think I would have
used up nearly as much as I had all of
this stuff or a lot of this stuff would
definitely probably still be in my
collection just hanging out chilling and
instead it is here all the way used up a
big thing this year was that I was able
to use up a lot of the deluxe size minis
that I had in my collection that were
just kind of cluttering up stuff just to
let you guys know my goal for next year
is going to be to use up 75 items I do
think it is gonna be a little bit harder
to use those items up next year because
again since I use those minis up this
year I don't have a bunch of minis
necessarily to go through and I will be
having to focus on larger items instead
of minis so anyway that's everything I'm
gonna go into detail now with everything
I used up if you guys are interested
then just keep watching this is kind of
a weird video and I'm sorry about the
lighting and everything we're just gonna
move past it we're gonna go and order a
face products for everything I used up
I'm not gonna do any reviews or anything
because this video would be way too long
so let's just get through everything you
used in detail this is the Tarte clean
slate primer I used up two of the
benefit primers once and the Jumbo sized
ones in the mini sized this is a
Smashbox photo-finish mini primer this
is the Clinique super primer in the mini
size and I love this this is the dr.
Brandt pores no more primer this is the
YSL blur primer this is the hourglass
mineral veil primer this is a little
pixie primer that says flawless and
poreless it's a peach one or something I
think no it doesn't say that so maybe I
lied and last this is the baby skin
primer for
on two foundations and BB Creams and
that type of product I used up ten of
these as well this is the covergirl stay
outlast stay fabulous this is a Smashbox
BB cream mini this is the Physicians
Formula organic where and this is a
tinted moisturizer this is the covergirl
Nature Lux foundation I finished up a
small size of the bare minerals original
foundation this was a cream foundation
from covergirl and Olay this is really
nice
this was the Tarte Amazonian colored
clay liquid foundation it was okay I
used up a mini of the big and easy
benefit I think it's like a BB cream
that's like a cream to powder finish
this is the Mary Kay time-wise
matte wear liquid foundation and last I
used up a mini of these steel s CC
creams I used of quite a few concealers
I used up two of the Maybelline fit me

covergirl this is the concealer bomb in
the shade fair this is a mini from
Benefit this is the fake up concealer
and laughs and my most proud
accomplishment this is the bare minerals
this concealer it's a powder concealer I
use that up I use them five powders this
year we'll start with the Smashbox one I
didn't use everything in here but I'm
counting this as using up a full powder
this was the highlight shade in the
contour kit I used up a loose powder
from Maybelline glad that's done this is
a disgusting mini powder from Tarte I
use up the Rimmel stay matte powder and
last this is a pan of powder that I used
up this is from ultra flush and I don't
think they make it anymore I was able to
use up one mini bronzer this year that's
it this is from Too Faced the chocolate
Soleil and it is all gone I used up one
little blush this year and this took me
forever to use up and for whatever
reason I forgot to put it in my project

really liked this it's just like a
liquid pen liner this is a pencil from
Elizabeth Mott it was in a pearl shade
this was a black liner from Make Up For

it any more I think that's why it's in
here cuz it's done and lastly use this
buxom liner in the color black Jasper
