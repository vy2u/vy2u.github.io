Lauren this is going to be my 2016 at
beauty favorites
most of these items ivory purchased
multiple times and you guys have
probably seen that through my empties or
they're just things that I hunted
percent would recommend to you guys I
really wanted to make sure that with
this video these were all things that I
could just only use those and be
completely happy with so I do have some
hair products and some skincare not only
makeup but we'll start with makeup
because it is the funnest and we'll go
from there I'm just gonna get it out of
the way this is the anasazi of Modern
Renaissance palette you guys know that I
absolutely love this this was in my top
five palettes of 2016 I will leave that
link down below if you just want an
eyeshadow palette version of this but I
just I love this palette I think it's so
pretty they did such a great job picking
out really on-trend colors I love that
they're matte the formula is creamy and
blendable and pigmented I just feel like
it's a home run in so many ways the
shimmers that they do give you our
really nice lid colors in her corner
colors I'm just really into this palette
along with the rest of the internet and
the world this is definitely something
that was worth the hype in 2016 and I
highly suggest it now like I mentioned I
do have a lot of other palettes that I
enjoyed last year but if I'm just trying
to narrow down my top favorites the
other shadow favorites I have to go with
are my Z palettes in just my single
shadows I really like the idea of single
shadows and the fact that you can pick
the colors you want put them in a
palette that inspires you you can move
them around I have my Bluegreen palette
here this one here is like my purple and
pink palette and then this is my warmer
like copper a yellow palette and then I
also have my everyday palette let me go
grab that I used it earlier this is what
my everyday palette looks like it's a
warm neutral palette I am trying to pan
this this year so I'm excited for that I
did want to point out a few shadows that
are my absolute favorite this one right
here is orange soda from Anastacio I
love that shadow I basically used up the
entirety of the shadow in my lavish
palette and then I repurchase this and I
already have a dip going in it I love it
this is creme brulee by makeup geek also
one of my favorites this is pumpkin pie
from Coastal Scents I also really love
that shadow one of my favorite on the
lid
is this one from makeup geek and it's
starry-eyed it's absolutely stunning
looks so great on the lid in the inner
corner it's that perfect super metallic
lit shade that just brightens your eyes
and the last shadow I have to mention
here is this one from Mac and this is
antiqued it's a really pretty
ready bronze color I really like using
that to deepen at my outer corner that
red tone and it really brings out the
blue in my eyes and there's something
about that shadow that I thought looked
so basic in the pan but it's so pretty
on the eyes so especially if you have
blue eyes I suggest it but it's a really
beautiful color and something that
definitely surprised me that I loved
this year I want to talk about a couple
foundation type products the first one
here is the covergirl clean matte EB
cream and I really like this before my
favorite BB cream was the Rimmel stay
matte I think that's what it's called
stay matte I really like that BB cream I
used it all the time I feel like I had
really good coverage for the fact that
it was BB cream but the shade range and
not is not very good and I just feel
like this is the upgraded better version
of that this has more shades still not a
ton but more this does oxidize a bit so
if you're super fair you might have to
put a mixer with it but I really like
this I think it's really great it
controls my oil really well for being
something so moisturizing and so natural
highly suggest this if you're looking
for something which it's easy everyday
and then for a more matte full coverage
look I really like the numbers have been
beautifully matte foundation I have two
shades here this one's calico and this
one's cool vanilla I mix these to get
the shade that is the closest I can get
I still wish these were a little bit a
little bit more fair the one thing I do
like about the color on these is that
they're not too yellow and they're not
too pink they're kind of this like
really neutral beige color and I just
like that sometimes I feel like
foundations just maybe they're light
enough but the tone of them is just like
weird to me on my skin tone so I really
highly suggest these they're very matte
I don't feel like they accentuate any of
my dry patches they go on so smoothly
and they just are easy to blend out and
get a really even coat I don't feel like
they go patchy which is a issue I have
with a lot of other foundations I just
highly suggest these ivory purchased
these probably I think
again my third time we're purchasing
these so they definitely have stood the
test of time and I really do like them I
forgot to mention an eyeshadow I'm sorry
guys this is from urban decay and this
is the color tonic this is an absolutely
beautiful duochrome shade I've almost
hit pan on this oh I love this shadow if
you're looking for something fun this is
definitely it I think this is just so
pretty and inspiring just I love it I
like could look at the shadow all day
long if you're looking for something
similar to this makeup geek just have a
shadow I believe it's called black light
that is similar but this was definitely
my first love and the one I suggest but
if you want to you know save a few
dollars go with the makeup geek and buy
a few dollars I mean like kind of a lot
of money onto other makeup items I'm
sorry if you can hear a barking dog
I can't help it oh this is one of my
favorites this is the elf eyebrow pencil
it's just two dollars and I just can't
get over that price this is the color
taupe and this is what I have in my
brows today plus a little bit of powder
I just love this pencil for the price it
love that has a spoolie on it two caps
do you like fall off like the clear one
that comes on here it's flies off in
three seconds but the product itself is
pretty dang nice this is a little bit
more of like a creamy brow pencil so I
find less product is more don't like get
up too much but I love it I repurchase
this like five times I just can't get
over the fact that I could get five of
these for the price of like one NYX
product like what it's crazy so I just
love it I really highly suggest it they
come in three shades and believe so
hopefully you combine your shade and I
definitely suggest at least trying it
out
two dollars come on it's two dollars I
wanted to talk about a few of blush
products one is just a blush a brand
that I really really like this is Laura
Keller and I've talked about them a lot
I feel like on my channel or I try to
because I really like her products this
is the blush and bora-bora I have hit
pan on this and I just think this is
such a nice everyday peachy shade it's
simple easy you don't have to think
about it it's not something that you can
over apply which I hate with blushes I
know people love pigmentation but I hate
when something is too pigmented and it's
a blush because my goodness like it
turns into
crazytown really fast other one that I
really like from her that I have is
boysenberry this is a matte shade and
it's more of that like mommy like my
gosh why am I so awkward so it's a
little bit more mommy and I don't know
it's still warm though I really like it
these are just great blushes I just
highly suggest her products and I think
that they should be talked about more
which I will be talking about them more
coz I bought a bunch of stuff from her
recently anyway other product that I
have is a Tarte blush this is limited
edition so I'm really sorry but this is
the blush and celebrated I really use
this a ton last year as you can tell I
just really like simple blushes this is
it they're something that's just easy
not gonna give you too much color
there's just like definitely a huge dip
in this and I was just using this
because I wanted to it wasn't in a
project or anything I was tempted to not
talk about the limited edition one but I
mean I have to be real with you guys and
even if you can't get it I still was
loving it so I'm really sorry if that
bothers you but it's something I've
spent my money on and I want to talk
about it so that's alright that's how
makeup is be not at the company not me I
also want to talk about a highlighter
this is something else from Laura Geller
and you've heard me rave about it this
is the highlighter in french vanilla and
as you can tell I've hit pan on this as
well I'm trying to use this up this year
this gives you such a beautiful natural
glow to the skin I love this look at
that isn't that pretty but it's not
metallic it just looks so nice I can't
get enough of this I highly suggest it
to everyone anyone if you are someone
who doesn't like a highlight that is
going to make you look like the Tin Man
and you know you find that a lot of
highlighters accentuate your texture or
fine lines I feel like this would work
for everyone I have some lip products
here and mostly just one color I love
the most but I thought I'd mention both
since I have both these are the full-on
lip pencils from buxom you've heard me
talk about dolly a million times and
I've also repurchased dolly because I
love it that much and I do not like lip
products that much this is the perfect
everyday color for me I love it it goes
with peppers in the eye look these have
a minty taste to the lip so they kind of
plump a little bit plus
personally I like mint which is
refreshing I feel like these look pretty
matte on the lips which I like I'm just
I love them the other color that I have
that I thought I would just show you is
the color Sydney it's more nude the
other one has more of that like rosy
tone to it I just feel like it gives me
a little bit more life that's why I like
it for everyday but this is also a great
color as well so I feel like these never
get talked about and I really like them
I also just love the format I love a
lipstick that's in that like longer
stick form instead of the traditional
bullet so highly suggest those
especially dolly it's just absolutely
beautiful great for everyday a bronzer
that I don't have here to mention
because mine fell on the floor and broke
is the butter bronzer I hit pan on that
bronzer this year and I love it it's so
pretty
looks so great on the skin I am sad that
it's mostly only for like a fair or like
lighter skin tones but for those light
skin tones it looks so nice and it
doesn't look too harsh it smells good
too so it's just a really really nice
product I cannot wait to repurchase it I
think that's everything for makeup I
don't think I'm missing anything I do
want to mention a tool really fast this
is my Beauty Blender it's dirty and
that's because I use it all the time I
love this to apply foundation to apply
concealer it just makes your foundation
look airbrushed it goes on so easy I
have a lot of texture on my skin when it
comes to pores I also have a lot of hair
on my skin and even though I'm oily I
also find that I can get dry patches too
so this just goes on top of that and
blends I foundation in and gives me a
smoother canvas than if I was going in
and buffing with a brush and disturbing
those hairs and disturbing that skin so
I absolutely love this especially two
for under the eye you can also apply
powder with this I like to even like
roll this on the skin if I'm feeling
like a little oily or anything like I'll
just roll it and soak up anything or if
I look powdery I just love this thing I
love the Beauty Blender the original
pink Beauty Blender is the best and
there's really one other tool that I
just can't imagine my life without and
is the Sigma e-40 brush I use this in
every tutorial I use this every single
day I love the way this blends out
colors in the crease I could do my whole
eye look with this brush if I wanted to
except for like obviously bottom
lashline but I just love this I highly
suggest this brush out of all the
brushes I would love to find like a
cheap ebay dupe of it because I would
just go crazy and buy like 700 of them
this brush just definitely changed the
way I did my makeup and I can't imagine
not having it let's get into some
haircare products the first one I want
to talk about is how I keep my hair pink
and this is a shampoo that also colors
your hair I think the brands viral or
maybe the brand celeb luxury not sure
this is the color hot pink I also have
it in light pink and lavender
I suggest the darker colors because
they're just going to give you more
pigment and with any color that I've
ever used whether it's this or the ion
which I use a lot
they just fate they're gonna fade so
fast so I just go dark and then I can
just wash my hair a couple times like
this is probably two or three times
without using this I mean it just kind
of fades out and lengthens up so I
really love this it makes dyeing my hair
so easy because I don't need to make it
a big production I can just put this on
in my hair in the shower wash it out and
I'm good to go I will say this darker
one stains my hands so I try to work
really really fast with it so my hands
aren't hot pink and it also can
potentially like stain your scalp a
little bit so I really like to scrub
kind of hard when I'm getting this out
of my hair so that hopefully my scalp
isn't pink too but to me it's all worth
it I love this and I highly suggest it I
don't know if you can get this I will
try to link it down below but my mom is
a professional hairdresser and we get
this at Cosmo Prof which is like a
professional beauty supply so if I can
find it I'll link it down below but this
is how I do my hair and this is what I
love I love it so much I couldn't make
this video without mentioning batiste
this is my absolute favorite dry shampoo
I have very thin fine hair it gets
Gracie really really fast and I need
something that's going to make it fluffy
again but not weigh it down and I find
that a lot of other direction of who's
just make my hair feel even more greasy
and this is just the best it's perfect
in so many ways I get my net marshals
for 479 so it's inexpensive this also
doesn't have aluminum in it which is
amazing so everything about this is the
best I need to just stop trying other
dry shampoos because honestly nothing
beats this I love this so much I do like
the chlorine one but it's just more
expensive so this still needs it it's
just the best the next haircare product
that I have in the last one is something
that I haven't had for forever or
haven't been using all of last year but
it has made it to my favorites because I
absolutely love it this is the PUF me
and this is a volumizing powder a lot of
brands do a powder that's volumizing but
this one you can spray into your hair I
love it because I can spray it into my
roots exactly where I wanted it's not
messy but it gives my hair just texture
it does make it feel gritty and almost
dirty but again because my hair is fine
and then if I don't have product in my
hair it just doesn't it's just limp and
fine and just sticks to my head it just
doesn't look good so this is perfect for
me when I want to put my hair in a bun
and it's the first day hair and I want
it to actually look textured and cute
instead of just like like a ballerina
bun or something
I really like this but it doesn't feel
it doesn't make my hair greasy and it
doesn't feel too heavy it's just really
nice family likes this too for his
shorter hair it gives hold but it's
still flexible so it like you can move
it around but it still kind of has some
like grit to it I just really like this
if you like volumizing powders then I
highly suggest this format because it's
just easy let's just get into some
skincare I think I only have a couple
more and they do have a perfume too so I
want to mention the Garnier micellar
cleansing water I love this I love the
price of this and how much you get for
it I just really like using micellar
waters to remove my eye makeup
especially because I don't like having a
greasy film on my face or on my eyes I
hate it so anything that's like bi-phase
or has the oil and the water I can't I
don't like it I don't like getting that
in my eyes I don't like feeling that
gunk in my eyes so this is perfect I
think this works really well it doesn't
burn
my eyes you can get this for such a
great value especially if you're using
coupons and using sales so highly
suggest this I also have to mention my
wipes these are the fel wipes from Big
Lots and I love these you get 60 of them
for $2 I use these to remove my face
makeup I use these in my kit I use them
for swatches I use them for anything and
everything because they're so
inexpensive I just love that I don't
feel stingy with my wipes I just use
them how I want to I really like the
aloe scent and I really like the green
tea those are my two favorite if you're
there checking them out I don't need to
talk about him a million times more you
guys know I love them
in my last skin care item that I love is
the st. Ives apricot scrub I feel like
this is just a staple that I always go
back to I love the way this smells
I love how gritty it is on my skin I
really feel like I'm getting a really
nice scrub and cleanse with this my
husband loves it it's just a great
inexpensive drugstore product that I
think works really really well and I
love having this in my routine it's
really nice so I highly suggest this I
know some people don't like it but I
love it and my last favorite is a
perfume this is something I absolutely
love and I'm so sad because as you can
see there's like nothing left of it this
is the eccentric molecule perfume and
this smells so good this is a unisex
perfume it's not too sweet I can't even
explain the way this smells you just
have to smell it and you will fall in
love every time I wear this without fail
people compliment me tell me they love
it they want to like stock means it just
smells so good and Sam really likes it
he even wears it sometimes I just highly
suggest this it is expensive but it's so
worth it I cannot wait to repurchase and
this is something that I feel like will
always be in my collection I have
noticed that when you're wearing this
you almost don't smell it on yourself so
you feel like oh is it like can you
smell it but everyone else can smell it
and they will tell you so highly highly
suggest this perfume it smells so good I
I could have this as my only perfume and
be happy okay guys those are my beauty
favorites for 2016
I feel like none of this probably was
that big of a surprise to you especially
if you watch a lot of my videos
these are just the things that I use all
the time and talk about all the time
these are my love's I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope you're having
a great rest of your day I'm done
filming for the day whoo I got a lot
done I have a busy week ahead of me so
so anyway I hope that you guys are doing
great
