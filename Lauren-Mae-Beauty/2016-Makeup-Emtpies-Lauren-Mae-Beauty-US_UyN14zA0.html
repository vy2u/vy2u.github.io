Lauren this is going to be my makeup
empties for 2016 I feel like this is the
video that we wait for as Project
panners seeing all the progress that we
made throughout the year all the empty
makeup that we've pushed ourselves to
use up and get our money's worth out of
it's super exciting so this is just my
intro I'm gonna go into kind of like
vlogs I'll show you guys what I've used
up and then at the end of the video I am
going to tell you guys how much money in
product I have used up for 2016 and I am
going to show you also all the makeup
empties that I used the year before so
I've been on YouTube about two years now
and I've been project panning basically
the whole time I started project panning
even before I started my channel but I
saved those empties to like I don't know
why cuz I'm just a hoarder I don't know
it was just so hard for me to get rid of
those and I just kind of tucked him away
in my closet so I didn't even think
about it but I figured I would show you
guys what two years of project panning
has done for me and what it's cleared
out of my collection I think that'll be
really exciting to see those older
products and just to see how much make
up in two years I've like used up but
here's just a sneak peek this whole
baskets full of makeup I do have some
perfumes and like body splashes on the
top here because I do count those as
part of my like makeup empties because
they're hard to use up and I'm really
proud of them so yeah if you guys want
to see what I've used up for 2016 then
just keep watching okay hi guys I film I
enter a long time ago and I'm finally
getting to filming my actual empties so
in these three baskets here I have all
the empties for 2016
makeup I'm gonna go in order of how I
would use them and put them on my face
also I did do a ton of math so I have
like how much I've used in total how
much I've used in each category
money-wise I did my best to calculate
that out and then as a bone
yes I have this which are my makeup
empties from 2015 because I'm a
psychopath and I saved those so we will
show that at the end so let's just get
into 2016 though first first we have
primers I went through eight primers in
2016 this is the Smashbox pore filling
primer this is the Mac prep and prime
it's just a deluxe sized sample this is
something I was using as a primer it's
the Stila one step in kit and it's since
been like discontinued I have two deluxe
sized samples of the GI primers ones the
anti-aging and the other one is the anti
blemish this is a full-size of the
clinic super primer this is murad
invisiblur and then last year is Charts
CC cream primer stick that I believe is
also discontinued so you guys know for
calculating prices anything that's like
old and discontinued where it's gonna be
hard to find a price I just put us five
dollars even anything in a deluxe sized
sample I put us three dollars even and
then anything that's still out and
full-size I looked up the price so I
went off of market value not what I paid
for it because I can't remember and I
really want to know the value of what I
used up even though I'm guessing out a
lot of it I feel like they're fair
prices for what it is and how much the
product is in value so for primers are
used up 66 dollars in primers okay next
I have foundations I only used up five
foundations in 2016 this is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped I have the number
seven beautifully matte this is makeup
Forever's Ultra HD foundation this one
is gorgeous cosmetics base perfect
foundation and then I had a small size
of this pur Lisse BB cream and all
together that's a hundred and sixteen
dollars in foundation next we have
concealers they're kind of like all over
the place I have benefits buying this is
Maybelline's age rewind this is what in
wild Illuminati this is a concealer by
by Terry which is very expensive I have
two Maybelline fit me is my favorite
this is a nude sticks contour and
highlighting stick but I used it as a
concealer so I just threw it in this
another bright airy product this is the
Toshiba Luce and then last another
Maybelline butter skin concealer so in
total four concealers I used up nine
concealers for a total of $210
okay four powders I ended up using nine
powders this is a little mini of the
tarte airbrush foundation this is a mini
of the Make Up For Ever HD I have a
coverall powder for mutton wild this is
a cosmetics bye bye pores this is
another sample size of a tart powder it
was a pressed one I have two of the bare
minerals fairly light foundations and
then also one of these is one of their
mineral veils and then last I have a
powder foundation from pure that's their
four in one powder in total I used up
eighty one dollars worth of powders for
brow products I used up ten different
brow products I obviously have some
repeats here these are the Maybelline
defined a brow and dark blonde and then
I have three of the elf pencils as well
I do have one brows this is a pencil I
got off of ebay and then over here this
is a pencil from Too Faced that's since
been discontinued and then this is a
pencil from vincent longo
in total I used up 71 dollars worth of
brow products
next I have bronzers I used up three
different bronzing products this is the
bourgeois bronzing primer this is a mini
sample of the NARS Laguna and then this
is the Smashbox contour kit it has three
powders in it but they are all gone so I
just counted in it with my bronzers the
total for these products is $57 I use of
quite a few eye primers last year this
is the NARS smudge proof it's just a
deluxe sized sample this is the lorac
behind the scenes also a deluxe sized
sample this is the Too Faced shadow
insurance another sample and then this
is the by Thierry hyaluronic eyeprimer
so I have four products and they totaled
$57 this is a $48 primer that's why this
next category is really tiny but this is
eyeshadow that I've used up this is the
NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk and then
this is an empty shadow pan for a light
matte cream colored powder eye shadow
that I went through
and these two products total 750 these
are all the eyeliners that I went
through the first one here is a gel
eyeliner from essence I was using this
for a lot of different things so it went
pretty fast I have to steal a
convertible colors these are long since
discontinued but I had so many of them
and now they're all gone so happy this
is a random tart liner that came in a
set I have a mary kay liner in bronze
this is a mini of a makeup forever liner
and then this was Urban Decay's Roach
liner so that's all that's left for
liners again I used up seven and that
was a total of $49
next I have mascaras I went through
quite a few mascaras I think this is
Maybelline's great lash this is Milani
trifecta mascara Smashbox x-rated Urban
Decay's perversion which is one of my
favorites this is a very tiny sample
size of bareMinerals lash domination and
then last on the end here is Maybelline
falsies I used up 7 mascaras and they
total 53 dollars I have a random
miscellaneous category one of these is a
glitter and the other one is a really
small duo lash adhesive I counted this
as a four dollar value but I just wanted
to show you guys that in the last
category that I have to show you guys
are lip products I just combined
everything in one this is my Korres lip
butter and jasmine I love this this is
the Nivea lip butter also a great lip
balm one of my all-time favorite lip
products ever is buxom stalling I used
that up last year this is a mini from
Kat Von D it's super old and celebutard
this is a mini lip gloss from bare
minerals in rebel I have a full-size of
the fresh sugar lip balm that's my
absolute favorite lip balm ever and then
I have one more tiny sample of the Too
Faced lip injection I used up 7 lip
products and they totaled $88 in value
that's it for makeup now I'm gonna move
on to perfumes in my one nail polish I
thought I would just shave guys my body
splashes first this is pink beach in the
sunkissed summer Krush this is a ghillie
Hix body splash and this is
a sensi layers in skinny-dippin and this
last one here is from about the body
works in French lavender and honey one
of my favorite scents so these are all
the perfumes I used up this year I have
a bunch of minis here that I didn't
count as actual items for the year but I
did count their value as a dollar so
these don't count as like seven items I
used up this year but they will count as
seven dollars worth of value I think
that's fair for how much perfume is in
these for full sizes I used up this
Gilly Hicks darlinghurst this is
discontinued and then I used up the big
size of the dot by Marc Jacobs I have
three different roller balls here this I
counted as a deluxe sized rollerball and
it's the DKNY in my NY this rollerball
is Marc Jacobs Daisy oh so fresh and
then I have a scent bird violin Moroccan
sing those are all my perfumes in total
I used up ten different perfumes and
body splashes equaling one hundred and
seventy nine dollars which is awesome
this was a really big part of that this
is a $98 perfume which is crazy and last
real facts they wanted to show you the
one nail polish that I used up this is
the Seche vite topcoat for Christ's on
this I put it at six dollars so yeah I
use up six dollars and nail polish so in
total this is my huge basket of all the
empties for makeup perfume and nails for
2016 this is a total of 84 items and the
amount is a thousand and $44.50 it's so
crazy that is insane that's a lot of
money I know a lot of you guys are doing
reverse Rouge this year it's cool to
know that if I was doing that last year
I would have hit it which is amazing
so yeah I'm really proud of that I also
did a calculation so if you take the
total amount of money spent on and
divide it by the amount of items each of
these items is about twelve dollars and
44 cents in value so that's really great
I feel really happy to get that much use
out of my collection do not let any of
these things go to waste and to actually
use them up I thought I would show you
that these are all
from last year I thought it would be
cool just to see everything out and see
like how much I've used up in two years
of project panning I'll give you some
stats really fast in this bucket for
2015 empties I used up a total of 77
items so not nearly as many and my total
money was 664 dollars and 50 cents so
about an average of eight dollars and 63
cents an item the biggest difference
between between this year and last year
is that I was using way more sample
sizes up in product and this is a lot
more full sizes I had a lot more primers
a lot more foundations used up in item
numbers but they didn't have as much of
value because it was just a little
sample size it was awesome to see myself
clear out some really big items and what
was so funny is that some of these items
I forgot I had ever used or whatever and
it kind of was like a trip down memory
lane to see those products and I'm like
oh my gosh that was that long ago or I
don't know it was a lot of reminiscing
when I was going through this bucket so
anyway I'm gonna set these all out by
category so you guys can see like a huge
overview let me add together how much I
used up really fast so in total for both
those years I've used up 161 products
and then for a total of money I have
used up one thousand seven hundred and
nine dollars worth of product all
because I was focusing on using products
up in my collection instead of buying a
ton of stuff I know that if I was not
project panning there's no way I would
have used all this up there's just no
way I would have had so much more
product in my collection I wouldn't have
had the focus to use up what I did so
I'm so happy with that I'm gonna leave
you guys off with a shot of all these in
their separate categories because I
think it'll be really cool but other
than that guys that's everything I hope
you have a great day thanks so much for
watching okay guys this is the final
shot of all the makeup sorry about the
noise I'm coming home but I thought I
would leave you off with that that's two
years worth of empties it's crazy
anyway I'm gonna throw all this crap
away now and I'll see you in my next
