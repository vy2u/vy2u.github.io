Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be going through all
of the makeup empties that I have for
2017 I know this video is a little late
but you know I still want to show you
guys all the makeup that I saved this is
everything that I went through when it
comes to just makeup and then I do keep
perfume / body mist because those are
like a big accomplishment for me yes so
let's get through this I'm gonna break
this down by category of how I apply it
on my face but I think I'm gonna just
start off with the perfumes first just
to get them out of the way cuz they're
so big and we'll run through each thing
just to let you guys know I will not be
breaking this down by how much I've
spent I was going to and I kind of
started but a lot of this stuff is
either discontinued or just old or like
sample sizes honestly I just felt like
my time is better spent not figuring all
that crap out I think it's super
satisfying when I watch other people's
and know how much they spent but I just
don't feel like I'm gonna get an
accurate amount of money and honestly I
just don't care I'm just happy that this
stuff is out of my collection and
something that I'm trying to do is find
a balance between panning and buying and
just not being obsessed with either one
and for me
figuring all that out it's just not
where my head is anymore
I'm staying with inventories it's just
not where my head is anymore so anyways
I just wanted to give you guys a little
explanation of why I didn't do that but
let's get into the perfumes and we'll go
through everything I used up super
exciting
alright so out of the items that you've
used up these are nine different perfume
type items obviously they range from
little samples all the way up to full
sizes so first here this is the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana white
perfume I just had like a medium sized
bottle of this I don't love that
fragrance I don't think it's bad but
it's definitely not one of my favorites
this one here is eccentric molecules and
this is one of my favorite perfumes ever
I missed this so much I went through
this in about a year and it makes me so
sad so I will definitely be repurchasing
that when I have a few more funds for
perfume next this is from Viva La Juicy
and this is the Lafleur perfume I really
love this I thought it was really nice
it was sweet but then the floral kind of
cut some of that sweetness
it's not something that I would really
pine for again and want in my collection
but I did enjoy it when I had it it is
definitely one that a lot of people gave
me compliments on it's just a nice
overall pleasant fragrance this one here
is tur kwatak from Mac this one I used
up in like a couple of months it's just
the small size smells really nice I've
realized that I like more of a unisex
fragrance I really like something that's
kind of a mix between either like clean
and sweet or floral and sweet yeah I
said this one was really great I would
definitely repurchase this one it's not
one of like my absolute favorites but
it's definitely one that I would get in
this size again and I would totally use
up it smells great and last for like
basically full-size perfumes this is the
Bulgari
omnia coral I love this scent this
smells so great on my body when I wear
this throughout the day it just melds
well with my chemistry and I get so many
compliments when I wear this from like
everyone so this is definitely one that
I would want in my collection again I
think it smells really great it kind of
has a very similar vein to me as like
Marc Jacobs Daisy which is another one
of my all-time favorite sons it's one
that's like kind of basic but it just
has such a place in my heart it's one
that I've worn for so long the Sam has
given me that perfume so many times but
this smells very similar to that perfume
I have a tiny little body mist here this
is the Victoria's Secret sexy little
things Noir I thought this was okay I
use it in my bathroom I used it up I'm
happy about that
and I'm ready to throw it away I have a
very small perfume here this is Britney
Spears fantasy a classic I actually
really like that perfume it smells great
there's a reason everyone loves it
because it's just like this you know
generally pleasing a sweet scent so I
would get it in this size again I
probably wouldn't go for anything bigger
than that because it's definitely not an
everyday for me it's a little too sweet
but it is something kind of nice to
change it up and it's crazy that so many
people can know the scent of that like
my
husband knows what Britney Spears
fantasy specifically smells like and
then I did have two little samples now I
usually wouldn't keep these in my
empties but I just am proud of these and
I'm even having a project pan for my
perfume samples specifically this year
but this is the gel Malone blackberry
and Bay I really enjoy that scent and I
want to purchase the full-size and then
this one speaking of Marc Jacobs Daisy
this is Marc Jacobs Daisy I really
enjoyed that scent as well so yeah I'm
really really happy I've cleared out so
many perfumes out of my collection this
year I mean it's crazy so I probably cut
my collection in half by really focusing
and I'm hoping to get rid of the rest of
the perfumes that I it's something they
don't like them I just they're not my
favorite so that way I can really have
just favorites in my collection perfume
could be such a signature scent and it's
so personal I really want things that I
feel like scream me and I'm so excited
and proud to wear so I'm really happy
with all of these used out so let's
start off with my makeup I actually have
already filmed this and I wasn't
recording yeah so I'm gonna try to speed
through this because I've already done
this once
so for primers I have used up six
primers in 2017 this is the Revlon
Beyond Naturals it's like discontinued
and super old it's just like a classic
like silicone primer I wouldn't
repurchase that one this is from first
aid beauty it's the coconut skin
smoothie primer I love this I thought it
was really nice it was super
moisturizing I really do recommend this
if you are looking for something like
that it's on my Sephora love's list and
definitely on my wish list next this is
a small little sample of the pure
correcting primer and this was an
illuminating primer I did not enjoy this
it felt kind of sticky on the skin it
definitely did give a bit of a glow but
it just it just wasn't my favorite I
wouldn't purchase that this is from hard
candy this is the shine free sheer envy
primer I enjoyed this for most of the
tube really thought I would repurchase
and towards the end it just isn't my
favorite so I would definitely look at
other primers from hard candy but I
don't know if I would purchase this one
if you're super oily and want a really
matte finish I think you would like this
but for me it just is
my favorite anymore this is probably my
favorite one here this is the YSL Touche
Club blur primer I use this and didn't
like it at first and then I don't know I
just I changed all my preferences this
year I highly suggest this even though
it's expensive and it has gold glitter
in it I don't know what it is but I love
it I really enjoy it and I'm using up a
small sample right now and I probably
will repurchase that and then this is
the Smashbox photo-finish classic primer
I use this in my kit and then use the
rest of it on myself once I was getting
pretty low I think this is great for a
makeup kit because it does cover so many
different concerns with so many
different skin types and ages and
everything I think it's great I
definitely want to get this back in my
kit yeah so those are all my primers
moving on to foundations I actually only
used one foundation up this is from NARS
this is the radiance cream compact I
believe I had in number two month Blanc
obviously it's used up I really enjoyed
this I thought it was really great but I
do believe this is being discontinued or
phased out or something it's difficult
to get I can't really find it on many
websites and only specific colors are
available if you were looking into this
it's a great one but there are so many
great foundations that I have founded
this year so even if this is being
discontinued as sad as that might be
there are a lot of other great ones out
there so I'm excited next year to work
on a lot more foundations next let's
talk about concealers I have five
different ones here this one here is
from Maybelline and it's the master
conceal in light I would definitely have
this in the fair shade but I got this
gifted to me so I can't complain I
really enjoyed it
this was the one with the most coverage
out of all the concealers you see here
and I feel like for the price you get a
lot of bang for your buck this lasted me
a really long time and I think a lot of
people would really enjoy this I would
also potentially pick this up again - I
did enjoy it the maybelline fitme
concealer is my absolute favorite this
is in the shape fair I'm so excited that
they extended their shade range they
have a bit of a lighter shade now and
they have some darker shades I am going
to probably start picking up the
lightest one that's new now because fair
works for me in the summer but when it
comes to winter it's just it could be a
little bit brighter on me so I'm excited
for that I have repurchase this I really
truly love it this is my ideal like
concealer formulation it's medium
coverage it's moisturizing it doesn't
look bad like it doesn't look cakey or
dry under the eyes i really suggest this
i love the price point as well this is
another one I really enjoyed this is the
Revlon Colorstay under-eye concealer I
believe this is discontinued but I did
pick mine up out of Big Lots I don't
necessarily suggest that but this was
$2.00 and I couldn't pass it up I really
enjoyed it it went by pretty fast but if
I saw one of these again I probably
would pick it up and last I have the
Milani retouch in a race concealer I
have picked this up again this is in the
shade fair I really enjoy this concealer
- again it's medium coverage so if you
don't like meeting coverages you
probably will not like any of my
concealer recommendations I just I don't
want something that's gonna set down too
crazy I don't know I just I want my skin
to look amplified but not totally
covered so anyway I really enjoyed this
and again repurchase it next let's talk
about powders I used up 7 different
powders this year and I realized
concealers powders and brow products are
my thing um I have two black opal
powders here these I used in my kit
these are the translucent pressed
version and this is a true translucent
powder in the sense that you can use it
on all skin tones including deeper skin
tones and it's not gonna look ashy which
is amazing I highly suggest this for a
makeup artist I highly suggest this for
really anyone it's great I don't have
the press version in my kit currently I
just have the loose one which is also
really nice I just love the ease and
convenience of the pressed powder that's
also super affordable as well so it's
just a win-win all around
next one here this is the Rimmel stay
matte and this is something that used to
be one of my Holy Grails I love the
price point and I used to just use a lot
of powder on my face and I know it seems
like I still do but I don't use nearly
as much as I used to I do have a
full-size of this in my drawer so I'm
gonna work through that this next year
see if it's something that I still love
enough to use up and if not I'll pass it
on but it's definitely not one I would
pick up at the store anymore there are
just so many other powders I want to try
this is the Ben Nye neutral set I used
most of this up in my kit but I do love
this I think it's a great setting powder
is it absolutely
amazing in the best most luxurious thing
no but this is like a $6 powder or
something like that it's great for the
price you get a lot of product it does
its job I think it's great this is a
powder foundation from pur it's the
foreign one pressed powder I have mine
in the shade light and I didn't really
enjoy this powder but it's really
expensive I also find that the shade
range is pretty lacking even for myself
and I'm fair like it's just there's just
a lot of problems with it so I just use
it too fast too so I wouldn't repurchase
this because of the price but I do think
it's a good product I just think there
are some issues with it this is the Kat
Von D locket setting powder and I did
not enjoy this I did think I liked it at
first but at the end I don't know it
just had a little bit of like a shine to
it I found that it's just like a heavy
translucent loose powder which is not
something that I feel like is normal and
so I just don't like how heavy it feels
on the skin I want something that's
lighter weight and this does not give me
that and last year is the Maybelline fit
me powder this is the matte and poreless
translucent I thought this was okay I
think with the light hand this would be
really nice it's not something that I'm
really wanting to repurchase at the
moment but if I was in a pinch and I
didn't know a lot of brands and needed
something I knew would work I would pick
this up again
moving on to bronzers I only used up two
browsers last year kind of crazy this is
the Milani baked bronzer and this was
like limited edition I don't know why
they made this matte bronzer a limited
edition but they did this was okay I had
a love-hate relationship with this
sometimes I liked it sometimes I was
really orange looking back at old videos
I definitely used to go crazy heavy on
the bronzer and I definitely don't do
that as much anymore so I'm just glad to
have actually finished this up a
full-sized that's a pretty big
accomplishment I'm really happy with
that and then the other bronzer was
actually a small pan of hoola this is
kind of a weird one because it was in a
palette and i depotted it I don't think
the original hoola really works for my
skintone I prefer the light but even
that one isn't necessarily something I'd
repurchase I own it currently and I
enjoy it it's just not my absolute
favorite all-time so anyway I'm glad I
got through that I did not use up any
blushes in 2000
17 but I did use up a highlighter this
one let's see if I'm in focus ever
this one's from Laura Geller and it's
the baked highlighter in French vanilla
I love this I've talked about this a ton
of times on my channel and I really do
think this is a truly universal
highlighter in the sense that it can
work for a lot of different just types
of people who like highlight it's not
going to give you something super
metallic but it definitely gives you
just this nice soft radiance a glow from
within it's gonna work on more mature
skin it's gonna work on textured skin so
that's what I really like it depending
on how dark your skin tone is
potentially could use this as well just
like lightly I think it would look
really pretty so I really enjoy that I
used up one eye primer this year this is
from lorac it's the behind the scenes
eye primer I had this in my kit and I
enjoyed it there were just so many
inexpensive eye primers on the market
now though that work really well but I
wouldn't spend the money on a high-end
one if you were gonna try high-end
though I would do one of the Urban Decay
ones or I would do the Mac Pot Paint Pot
I think I'm just gonna mention setting
sprays here I do have two of the mac
fix+ this is my all-time favorite
setting spray I think it works amazing I
prefer the original this one here is the
coconut and it just does not smell good
even though I love coconut this just was
gross I think this works well for
setting your makeup refreshing your
makeup it's gonna get rid of a powder
finish I love the way it feels
i shadow it has so many purposes so I
definitely have your purchase this will
repurchase it it's my all-time favorite
at the moment all right next round a
brow products and I told you I freaking
love brow products this is my absolute
favorite brow pencil from ELF it's two
dollars and it's great I use the shade
taupe it only has three shades but I
feel like they're pretty universal and
the price point I just cannot beat it so
yeah highly recommends these guys
they're so good the other two brow
pencils that I have here are from
colour-pop
this one is their older brow pencil and
then this one is their new brow boss
brow pencil this is in the shade dope
taupe and this is in blonde
I love the blonde one I've actually
repurchased this and have two backups
and I'm using one currently I think it's
great it's a stiffer formula definitely
more comparable to the Anastacio like
brow Wiz highly suggested if you're
looking for a cheap brow pen
these are only $5 this one is okay but
it's a little bit more waxy and if I'm
gonna do something waxy I can just go
with my ELF one so yeah those are my
thoughts on those and then I have to
kind of like gel type of products this
is the Anasazi a clear brow gel this is
my favorite one granted I haven't tried
a ton of clear brow gels but this one if
you're really wanting something that's
gonna lock your brows into place this is
the best one that I found it just it's
gonna hold it all day long I don't have
a ton of like unruly hairs but if you do
I suggest this and then this is the
ultra brow tint in light this has a
really small spoolie kind of like the
benefit gonna benefit whatever there's a
little tiny one I want to call it
Benetton but it's not I enjoyed this I
think it's nice but when it's new it's
kind of gloopy so I like it to dry out
just a little bit I'm just gonna move on
to mascaras next this one here is the
Maybelline great lash this is what I use
in my makeup kit because I'm not using
the wand on people I just need a mascara
that's going to actually make the lashes
dark I've used up multiple tubes of this
this is just the only one I have in here
but I just thought I would share that
with you guys because this is a great
one it's inexpensive and it works really
well I also suggest having waterproof
and black brown in your kit next this is
from real Estelle and this is the
volumizing mascara I guess I'll try to
show you guys wands the wand on this
looks like that it's okay I prefer the
lengthening version of this mascara and
I would repurchase that again this is
expensive though this is like a $30
mascara so yeah if you're gonna get it
get the length anyone next this is from
Eden minerals this is the err mascara I
did enjoy this I thought it was okay
it's kind of a big wand though I
wouldn't repurchase it but I did use it
up and enjoy it this is the pure fully
charged this one I actually really did
enjoy this has a pretty chaotic wand so
it's like natural but gives a lot of
volume and length I would definitely use
up another free sample of this I don't
know if I'd purchase it this one here is
the Marc Jacobs Velvet noir mascara I
really enjoyed this again it kind of has
that chaotic looking wand I did get this
for my mom
she wanted to try something and she
enjoys it she's recommended it to her
hair clients and they've enjoyed it so I
think this is a real good one if you
want some volume it definitely need
gives a little bit of length but it's
it's more on the volume aside and then
my favorite one this is Urban Decay's
perversion and I just love this it's a
nice full wand but it just gives me nice
like wispy lashes I'm currently using
the full size and I do think it's a
little bit different I'm still
navigating that one but I love it in the
mini for sure I think the mini is great
we're so close guys just hanging in with
me a little bit longer I have four
different my hairs here so the first one
here is from Laura Geller it's just a
brown one I enjoyed it god it's gone I
have this one from pop beauty and this
was like in a bronze shade if you guys
were with me at the beginning of the
year you know I use this so much really
enjoyed this would actually consider
purchasing it I liked it that much
really great this is my all-time
favorite white liner from Stila and it's
discontinued and you know it's it's good
that it's gone because it's really too
old but my goodness is it white and it
stays in the waterline and I've never
found anything that goes on like this so
I'm really sad please leave any
recommendations for white eyeliners down
below I've tried the color pop one and I
hate it
I've tried a Maybelline one and I hated
that one I'm trying one currently and I
don't like it from wet and wild so yeah
and then last year this is from Urban
Decay and it's the color rockstar and
it's gone I'm just gonna show the last
two products on the same little slide
here I finished up one lip product
that's it I'm pathetic this is from
Tarte and this is the exposed lip
surgence I think they call them like
lippy lingeries they're something
different now you can't still get this
color I do love the formula of this and
the color and everything it's really
great it was good I enjoyed it glad I
used up something so it's a win and then
last I have a single eyeshadow here this
is from starlooks
and it's in the shade pearl obviously
it's gone but I did enjoy this I used it
as a face highlighter I hit pan on it in
2016 and finish it up this last year I
enjoyed it and I I would never
repurchase it it's just like
pearly white eyeshadow but I'm glad it's
gone thank you so much for watching guys
I really appreciate it my next video is
going to be showing you guys how I
repress my shadows and then you'll get
to see my face again I promise no more
of this nasty table anyway thank you so
so much for watching guys and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
