Lauren thank you so much for watching
it's another no-face video but today is
exciting we're going through my makeup
empties for half of the year I like to
do this every year I think I have done
it every year on my channel but this is
just a way for me to look over what I've
used up for the year kind of get excited
to the second half of the year get
pumped I want to use up more stuff so
that I can kind of hopefully double
whatever I have going on in this back
end I do feel like this year is a little
light for me I have been the least into
panning since I've started my channel I
was really really into it when I first
started and not that I don't like
panning now but I feel like I'm a little
bit more realistic I have a waist
smaller collection than when I first
started my channel so I just don't have
as much immediate need for it so it's
just more of a fun thing I like to do
anyway we'll get into this I'm not going
to go in any particular order I'm just
going to pick things out a lot of this
on the top is perfume as I'm sure you
can already see and that's all of an
introduction I'm going to do so let's go
so first off I'm going to do perfume
this is the imbolg re omnia coral I
really love the scent I'm sad that it's
gone this is something that when the
reproach attorney I did have this once
and then I got another one of them so I
definitely have besides I would probably
repurchase it as well it's something I
did really enjoy having in my collection
and part of Venus's next is the
absolutely most sad one this is molecule
a1 or eccentric molecules you guys know
I absolutely adore this fragrance it's
also good it's unisex I just love having
this on my skin Sam really liked it and
yeah so so good so expensive but to me
so worth it I will repurchase this at
some point I love it that much this is a
newer one for me this is max turk kwatak
I just got the smaller size and I did
really enjoy this it's a nice clean
aquatic scent and I really did enjoy
this again I was probably repurchase it
as well this is the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana white perfume I did not really
like this it was a struggle as you can
see I did project Panzers item I wanted
to use it up identity
in a bid I spin it up early it's okay I
can see why other people would like it
but for me it's just a little too clean
a little too powdery it's definitely not
a scent that I would need in my
collection or really want and I believe
my last little perfume is this one from
Britney Spears fantasy just a small
little bottle I like the smell of this
man it smells good it's very sweet it's
that it's classic celebrity fragrance
but I did like this I would like to have
another little bottle like I think this
is the perfect sized bottle just for
those times you want something kind of
sweet and fun it is a nice one in a lot
of people like this end too like people
will compliment you on this is hilarious
when you have to tell them that it's
Britney Spears I have a few more map
products here these are both the six
plus this little one is the 6 plus in
the coconut you guys know I don't like
them I just don't like to smell and
that's sad because they love coconut but
I won't go into it anymore be regular
fix+
is so good I love this setting spray I
have your purchases it's in my kit right
now I love the smell of this product I
love the way it works on the skin I love
that it can be used to boil I shadow I
feel it there so many uses it's
definitely a very versatile product and
I enjoy it a ton I'm trying to try they
go in an order I don't know these are
two different primers I have the
Smashbox photo-finish I use in my makeup
kit and really liked it I kind of Miss
having something like this there's
something about the consistency isn't
that works on so many different skin
types
it's just that classic silicone primer
but it just works so well I really do
like this and I miss it in my kit this
is the health have coconut skin smoothie
priming moisturizer for a first date
beauty I'm giving you yet another little
sneak peek to my finished 13 by
Halloween so I believe that down below
if you haven't seen that but stay tuned
because I have some more progress to
show you in that one anyway I really
like this product and it's really weird
too I do have oily skin but this works
really nice on my skin and all the way
it moisturizes I like the way it feels
over being like so much about this is a
yes so I would potentially purchase a
full size of this or add it to my kid I
really do like it I thought it works
really well I like the smell just
everything about it was a win
we'll say two though what are you
looking for in primers is a bit
different than it used to be I feel like
they used to want stuff that's going to
keep me mad and keep product on my face
for the rest of time and I'm not really
into that any more and more into
something that's going to prep the skin
moisturizer and make foundation look
like my skin on top of it I'm not really
concerned as much about it being as
matte throughout the day or having
insane longevity I'd rather have my skin
look the best it can from the beginning
of the day I'm and then touch-up or kind
of just deal with it from then on I
don't know I do like more luminous skin
than I used to
I thought it would just say that okay we
got quite a few powders and I try to
have this many powders honestly but a
lot of it I guess is from a kit anyway
this is the Maybelline fit me powder in
translucent I'm not the biggest amethyst
I think that it's a nice powder and if
you want a matte look it's nice but it
does seem to going a bit heavy I want to
try the fit me in the loose powder and
see what that's like because I just
enjoy loose powders more than press
powders at the moment I also really want
the warmer see anyone but well see I
have two of the black opal pressed
powders these are the invisible oil
blocking powders and pedis translucent
but they work on dark skin tone if you
aren't aware even though something's
translucent doesn't mean that it's
actually going to look translucent on
someone with more pigmented skin a lot
of times it can make them look ashy
which is horrible these are amazing I
really like these I continue to
repurchase them they are really
inexpensive I also have a loose powder
version in my kit and enjoy that as well
this is the Ben 9 neutral set this is
basically just a regular translucent
powder I really like this as well it's
very inexpensive it does the job I used
a lot of this in my kit throughout
school in my kit once I was working and
freelancing professionally afterward and
when I finish it up in my own collection
because it just I had other ones and
whatnot so I did really like that and
last is the Rimmel stay matte this is a
good powder it's an overall inexpensive
ok powder I feel like it's not very
finely
although if you're looking for something
that's going to be very undetectable on
the skin I don't think this is for you
necessarily I don't think it's bad I
just think if you like hand it's going
to look the best I just go hand with
powder though so it's people like that
look you know I used to love it so I
don't know maybe I'll go back to it I
found another primer in there guys this
is the pure correcting primer I do not
like this this is a little bit too
luminous and a little bit too sticky on
the skin so that's kind of it's crazy
when things really do have different
formulas though you know this one isn't
as luminous and it doesn't have that
sticky feeling it smelled nice and they
seem to be similar but I live this one
way more I'm surprised they only have
three concealers so they usually have
way more of course two of them are B
Maybelline fit me they're my favorite
I'm sad because they don't have this in
my collection right now and I miss it
I do like other concealers but this one
just gives me coverage while still
looking nice on the skin I like the
color match just everything about this
is so nice worth some of the ones I have
in my collection right now are just too
pigmented there look a little dry on
under-eye I don't know this is just like
perfect for me I loved it I also really
loved this one though this is from rebel
eyes the color state under eye concealer
I got this at big lots of children at
any time so it's like two dollars and
change which is amazing because it's
probably retail for like ten if it's not
discontinued I liked it so much I
thought it looked really good underneath
the eyes but it's so expensive and this
product goes so fast you clip up ten
sterile ones I find I really like the
formulas of them at the time but how
fast use the product is definitely a
downside and something that just stops
me from purchasing them especially at
full price they're just too expensive to
continuously repurchase those a cool one
this is my bronzer into the low that I
finished up so happy about that this is
such a big accomplishment I know it just
looks so boring cuz it's just an empty
pan but when you think about the fact
that this was filled with product pretty
amazing I really worked on mascaras this
year this point it'd be great lash from
Maybelline and very black I use this in
my kit and I really really like it I
like some
inexpensive for my kids because I can't
use the wand on people so I just need
something that's going to actually take
the lashes if I really was working on
someone who had a preference I would of
course get them what they wanted or if I
was working on someone for a long period
of time I might invest in something more
but for everyday use and usually when I
cover it with washes anyway this is
perfect this is the realest still
volumizing mascara now I don't really
like this one but I do like the realist
still lengthening mascara that is such a
great mascara it also kind of grows your
lashes which is amazing so I don't
recommend this one but the other one is
so so good I'll leave it link down below
what this one just thinking she want to
check it out it's pricey but I did
really enjoy that otherwise this one not
so much I guess I'll try to review that
too this is the Eden minerals herb
mascara and I just really like this as
well it's super duper black the wand is
really nice it gave me nice - volume it
was just time to let this one go I used
it all up it's really pretty packaging I
really like the brand even in general
everything I've tried from them for the
most part has been really really nice
quality and I love that it is moral
natural it's more just natural-looking
on the skin it's really hitting a lot of
marks for me in terms of what kind of
makeup I'm liking at the moment this is
the pure fully charged mascara I also
really like this okay I like a lot of
mascaras guys you should see the
bristles in them they just are kind of
crazy and they just do a such a great
job at lengthening and separating and
coating all the lashes and I really
liked it too so that one's good I will
preface this with I do have pretty nice
lashes they're not the longest but
they're not short so as long as the
mascara doesn't just like clump them all
together I usually can work with it and
I don't only like something that's too
wet of a formula either last year this
is me Marc Jacobs velvet noir mascara
again a very similar brush to be fully
charged I really liked this I thought it
worked nicely this cables bit more
volume than the other ones did but it
still gave me enough lengthening that I
did really enjoy it again super black I
feel like all of these were pretty doing
black
and I really liked it as well the last
items here guys I have my lorac behind
the scenes eye primer this is a mini you
get with the palettes I really like this
I would definitely purchase it I have
other ones though I was using this in my
kit and it's a good one
I will say though when you are using
this product tends to get crust up here
and that is kind of irritating when you
have to squeeze it out and stuff like
that so packaging lines for this mini
specifically it's not my favorite oh I
have one lip product here this is the
chart exposed lip pencil really like
this color see so pretty you guys know
love other edge also really likes those
colors she used one up and repurchases I
would potentially repurchase that
products actually I did really like it I
thought it was really nice and I like
the formula it's good I'm going to talk
about the eye liner then we'll go into
all the brows this is from pop UD it's
the color bronze bonanza and you guys
know I really like this that's it there
I love that this is a nice mix of being
a warm toned bronze but still dark
enough she gives me definition though I
really like this I also love this
smudger on the end although it's like
out more than normal for whatever reason
it's not usually that long anyway I did
really really liked that product I would
probably repurchase that at some point
as well or just try to find something
similar I just really like those bronzy
deep Browns
on my eyes instead of just black I have
to brow gel this is the ultra brow tint
in light I really like this this is a
great product it has a really nice small
little spooley which is great to put
product on the brows I like the color I
would repurchase this as well and my mom
liked it too I think for the price it's
really nice the price is really nice
this is the honest I via clear brow gel
I've had this for way too long
and I love this though this is the best
brow gel clear brow gel out there it
just is there's not too much product on
the brush which is so nice to goop up
your brows but it also holds them in
place and really just stay all day long
I really like this I would definitely
want to try other ones but from
everything I've tried when it comes to
clear brow gels this is the choose the
best and last is a pressed
I really really hate which is the elf
brow pencil
so now I really love that it's so good I
use these all the time
these are $2.00 guys they're so
inexpensive I highly suggest them for
anyone looking for and you've brow
pencils that are really cheap they
aren't a super fine tip brow pencil but
they still work for me I can use these
just these in my brows and get a really
nice look that I love so I suggest them
alright great so that is everything I've
used up so far this year I hope this
inspires you to really maybe start a
project if you are not doing lines or
just kind of weed out some products in
your collection that are almost gone and
just finish and left do it you'll feel
so happy that you actually used it up
and not let it just sit and collect us
in your collection when you have like a
week or two worth of youth left in them
