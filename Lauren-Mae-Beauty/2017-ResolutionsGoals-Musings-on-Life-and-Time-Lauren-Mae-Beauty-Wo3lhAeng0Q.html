channel I hope you're having a great
start to 2017 this is my first video
that I'm filming since I've been back
since 2017 it started I know I was off a
little bit I've been trying to put some
of my pre-recorded videos out but I
really wasn't posting very much at all
of December or even the beginning of
January so if you follow me on Instagram
you guys know that I went to San
Francisco and then I went home for the
holidays so me and Sam weren't here for
good I don't know like I want to say
almost 20 days we were out of town which
is a lot I missed being home for sure I
missed having routine and all that but
it was great to see family and although
YouTube was in the back of my mind
honestly there just wasn't time for
YouTube and I wanted to spend time with
family so I did anyway I thought that I
would start this year's video the first
video to me this year reflecting on last
year's resolutions kind of talking about
my headspace going into 2017 some of my
resolutions for beauty but mostly just
in general I've been thinking a lot
lately
time has really been just like messing
with my mind that's her short I'm gonna
be 25 this year which feels really
really weird I know that's not old by
any means it's just weird you know like
I'm not scared to get old I am excited
to grow old and you know enjoy life in
all different stages I think that each
stage of life is totally different and
there's just different things you can do
and gain and you have different wisdom
going into those years so I'm not like
scared to get old it's just so weird I
feel like I can like I almost step
outside my body and I feel really young
but when I hang out with really young
people I'm like oh oh no I'm not young
but I don't feel old either I don't feel
like I'm 25 I don't feel like I'm gonna
be into my late twenties soon so anyway
that's kind of just what I've been
thinking about where some of these
resolutions or just these are his
thoughts on the year and I don't feel
like you even need to like start these
things on the first of the year like you
should start these whenever you want to
and whenever you feel like it because
again with time like you get one chance
one shot I'm not trying to be Eminem
but it's true you don't get a redo like
you just don't you know um something
I've been thinking I don't know why some
of you guys this is kind of rambling I'm
so sorry but it's going to be I don't
know why but lately I've been thinking
about the fact that you know my college
experience is really different than a
lot of people I worked full-time my
entire college and I didn't live on
campus I was like online school for the
last two years except for a couple
classes at the end like my final classes
because I did get two degrees I got a
degree in history and religion of high
ethics so I didn't get that normal
college experience and I went to ASU so
I also didn't like get like an Ivy
League and I didn't even really want
that but lately I've been meeting a lot
of people who have been to Stanford and
have been do you know just more
prestigious schools and kind of had that
experience and then they also have this
like network of people that went to
school with them and part of me feels
like I missed out on that and I say
things like I wish I could it would have
done that I wish I could have done that
like I can never go back like I can
never be that young again and you know
make decisions in that mindset of being
that young in that time and space like I
can never do that I can never go back I
can't be like oh I'll do that next time
like no there's no next time and so I
don't know why that's just resonated
with me but that's just how I'm feeling
about life in general so there's
something you wants and then you want to
do you want to go for a career you want
um you know just anything if you want to
travel like I just feel like just make
it happen because I'm telling you you
don't get to come back and do it you
don't get to be like oh next time around
I'll go to Thailand like no go to
Thailand tomorrow not really but you
know anything booked a flight
figure it out like make it happen
because this is it not trying to be
morbid but you could die tomorrow and as
sad as that would be it's just like you
know I just want to make sure I'm living
the best life I can and doing what I
want so anyway let's get into some
resolutions the first resolution for
2017 for me or just something I want to
work on as I just want to stop
apologizing and I mean this in a lot of
different ways I mean
in my attitude like I want to do I'm
gonna do what I want obviously I'm not
trying to be rude to people but I don't
need to apologize for things I want to
do I know I'm a good person I don't need
to apologize to any of you guys on
YouTube for not posting or for this or
that it's like we're not commenting back
like it's something I'm working on but
I'm done apologizing for it and I'm
gonna stop worrying about it because I
feel like a lot of my apologizing comes
from a spot of anxiety and worry I'm
done
so yeah that's something I want to work
on and that way I also just want to in
general stop saying sorry all the time
for things that I don't need to be sorry
for
I've talked about this before and a
couple people in the comments were like
I totally get it like on set instead of
just being like pardon me or excuse me
or something back to like get out of the
way if someone's trying to get past me
like oh I'm sorry but like I'm not sorry
actually and film is totally dominated
by men and I don't need to be saying I'm
sorry or being any more weak that I need
to show on set so I'm done I'm gonna try
really hard to like change that I know I
said it before and I was working on it
this year but that's definitely
something I want to carry with me into
2017 and continue working on another
thing I want to work on is just saying
yes more and to actually make things
happen if you know you're in a group of
friends let's say another little
anecdote let's talk about stories when
we were back home during Thanksgiving we
had a friend over and she was like oh I
work at this like spin class if you guys
want to go and we were all like oh
that'd be kind of fun and I actually
made us like make it happen like we
would we woke up early no one wanted to
it was a free class so we didn't even
have to pay and most the time I would
have been like hell no it's early I
don't want to work out like we're on a
bike like just please I don't want to do
that but I made it happen and it was I
mean I wasn't the funnest thing I've
ever done but it was fun it was a good
time I'm glad to have that experience
I'm glad I can talk about that
experience of people and overall I was
really glad that I did that instead of
sleeping in and not having that
experience so I'm trying to just say yes
more if people are like let's do this
I'm like yeah let's do it and actually
make it happen like let's be the people
that actually do the things we say we're
gonna do I feel like I'm pretty good at
doing that
I really want to work on I guess we'll
talk about some beauty things since you
know so were these have all been life
things for beauty I really just want to
continue loving the things I have
continuing to declutter the things that
don't bring me joy that I just don't
enjoy anymore and being smarter about my
purchases the beginning of last year and
the end of last year are totally
different places at the beginning of
last year first time I met so I was
doing a demo with my school I was so
nervous and you know I was like oh my
gosh I'm putting makeup on someone and
now I have actually been working in the
industry and I'm not as nervous as it
used to be at the beginning of the year
I was going to get just like a normal
Beauty job in a store or something and
like I said I'm now working makeup
artist so it's just a lot different my
ideas on things have changed buying
makeup is just part of my job so it's a
little bit different there and I like
having new products and staying up on it
because some people that I do care about
that so my camera just shut off but
anyway I'm not trying to necessarily
completely restrict what I'm buying but
I do want to continue to not like buying
to hype and to just make smart purchases
I think we all should strive to do that
everyone on every level like we don't
need all the clutter we don't need
everything that's coming out wine we'd
be bankrupt too we just don't need it so
much crap so I'm trying to just you know
just bring the gems in only the gems no
duds what else
I mean beauty wise I mean that kind of
covers it for me for beauty I also this
is the year of the grind for me as much
as I was working in the industry last
year I wasn't the whole year so this
will be my first year completely a
hundred percent working as a makeup
artist and I really just want to hustle
and make money and just in general make
connections and just work really hard
and be positive and get my career kind
of going and continuing to go and then
also counts for YouTube too I know a lot
of people come on and say like oh I just
oh my
can you hear that I know a lot of people
come on here and talk about how YouTube
is just a hobby and it is just a hobby I
don't make enough money on this for it
at all to be a job for me but since I do
get work I would love for this to be an
extra stream of income that doesn't mean
I want to like sell out or anything like
that it's just I would love for that I
think anyone who has a youtube channel
would love to see their channel grow and
for it to be successful not only with
like connecting with people and growing
with subscribers and growing a community
but also monetarily like let's be real
so so those are some things I want to
pay off debt this year I don't want to
get like too personal with finances but
yeah we do have some debt we've been to
college and I really do want to really
focus on that this year me and Sam are
also focusing on eating anymore we eat
out all the time which not only is
unhealthy but it's fun so much money we
spend so much money on food and right
now we just don't have the balanced food
so that's kind of helping and it's the
new year and all these things so just
trying to get right with that I'm kind
of just like going off the top of my
head here also I want to travel out of
the country this year I'm hoping we
could do something like Australia or New
Zealand or something like Southeast Asia
hopefully those are the two places that
are kind of next on our list we did Peru
in 2015 we just did like small trips in
2016 and I try and really like to travel
every other year out of the country so
that's something that hopefully we can
try to like at least get booked even if
it's not this year like we have the
tickets booked we were planning a trip
like it's official set in stone type of
thing that would be amazing and
something that I'm really focused on
this year other than that though I just
don't have any specific goals for beauty
I don't have like oh I can only buy five
of this or no nail polish or anything
like that I'm just kind of trusting
myself a little bit more and I also have
seen what it's like when I'm working and
I just don't even have time like I don't
even have time all December literally
until like the day we left I worked
every day except for three days in
December and then we were gone the rest
of it so just trusting myself and
letting myself have some things and
treat myself sometimes but just being
more focused about it
if that makes sense so anyway I just
wanted to like talk about some
resolutions mostly catch up with you
guys because it's been forever I have a
ton of videos to fill I do I have a lot
of videos to film I hate filming more
than like three videos in one sitting
because I just hate that it's like the
same hair and whatever but I have two we
have some finales we have some intros
I'm behind on like Beyond behind on so I
need to get this thumbs today hopefully
these will all be up I also want to
mention at the end here that I'm ooh I
also want to mention at the end here
that I will be posting older videos
potentially like in between the new ones
or whatever whatever I have it just need
to like push it out so that I can get
this a new stuff up and also I might
push this up first because it's more
like time sensitive and then have that
stuff after so if you see stuff with
like old hair whatever that's why I like
that's why I don't want to get rid of it
but it's just behind I think that's
everything for this video I really hope
that whatever resolutions or goals or
anything that you're trying to do and
accomplish in 2017 or just change for
your life in 2017 I really wish you all
the best
definitely let me know down below if any
of these things are something you are
trying to work on or what you're working
on let's do this 2017 it's gonna be
awesome
I know there was so much negativity
about 2016 and I agree there was some
bad stuff but like you know it's not the
Year guys it's people and it's life and
it's things and yeah I just want to stay
positive and you know not focus on the
negative and not focus on the bad things
and do the best that I can to change
what I can and make it the best year
that I've lived thus far so anyway
that's everything I'm ending it here for
real and let's get into some other stuff
so look forward to videos I might be
just like blasting you boom boom boom
video after video so prepare bye guys
I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
