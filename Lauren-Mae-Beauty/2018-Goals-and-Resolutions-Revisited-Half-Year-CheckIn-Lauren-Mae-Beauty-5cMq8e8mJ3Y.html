Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought it would be fun to go
back to my 2018 New Year's resolutions
and goals and kind of check in on them
see where I'm at there is this a fervor
that comes at the beginning of the year
everyone's excited having positive vibes
ready to take on the new year and all
their goals and dreams and make
happen and so I thought it would be good
to check in see where I'm at see how I'm
doing with some of the goals that I set
for myself I was hoping that maybe this
could be inspirational for you guys as
well just kind of like a halfway point
check in to where we're at what we're
doing if we maybe haven't had the best
start to 2018 how can we fix that today
what can we do to make steps in the
right direction I'm all about trying as
much as possible to have self-reflection
and to try to just you know make every
day a little bit better and go toward
whatever it is that I'm wanting to get
at I don't know anyway so let's just get
into it I'm gonna leave the original
video link down below if you want to
check it out I think that's everything
so the first thing that I really wanted
to focus on this year in 2018 is to stay
teachable just kind of making sure that
I'm staying open to other people side of
a conversation to other people's points
of view to not just feel like I'm always
right and to just listen more and be
open to just other possible solutions to
problems or really any other situation
that that might apply to and I feel like
I've been trying to do a really good job
of that this year it's not like I had
like a problem with that I just think
it's a really important thing to try to
keep in your mind
I feel like specifically with YouTube
I've been really trying to be that way
when it comes to creators and
subscribers and comments and just things
like that just staying teachable you
know trying to understand another
person's side of things and not just
jump to conclusions in any way I'm not
sure if that really goes to staying
teachable but I think it does you know
not just feeling like just because I
assume something about someone or you
know where someone's coming from that
that is right or correct and just trying
to stay open I think with this also I'm
trying to just have more empathy for
people in general trying again to
understand people in their different
situations understand that every
life and their experiences are so vastly
different and so how I experience
something based off of my past and what
I'm going through is so different
potentially than how someone else is
experiencing it and I can't just expect
someone to have the same feelings and
emotions that I do attached to something
because they might have like the
complete opposite experience or feeling
because of what they've gone through so
I still I'm trying to stay that way and
I think also adding just you know being
more empathetic to other people and just
you know trying to relate to more humans
on this planet yeah number two on my
list was hashtag Yolo you only live once
and to say yes to more things I talked
about how Yolo is just like this
hilarious thing and I feel like it's
kind of goofed on a lot but it's so true
it's just such a true statement you only
live once and I think something that I'm
really I feel like every single day just
kind of you know remembering is just
like seriously this is it you get the
one chance if there's something you want
to do if there's something that you like
and if there's something you're
passionate about like i i'm just very
much a dreamer if you guys didn't know i
mean the fact that me and Sam are out
here in LA for him to act and for us to
try to just pursue creative fields you
know we're just we're dreamers and I am
very much about if there's something
that you want to do in this life that
you should do it you should put your all
into it you should make it happen I know
that everyone's circumstances are
different and you might have children or
you know bills or all of these things
that can kind of get in the way and
maybe make something that you really
want comes secondhand or you know take a
back seat but I really think that if
you're passionate and it's something you
want to do that you can find a way to
make a plan to make that a reality and
you know starting little by little every
single day you can make something
amazing happen and I think also with
this just having an attitude of
gratitude is really really important and
I think could help you go so much
further and can help you achieve so many
more things in your life doing things
being grateful even if it's something
you don't want to do if it's a job that
you really hate
or whatever finding something in it to
be grateful for I feel like so many more
opportunities in your life will open up
it's definitely something I try and I'm
trying to focus on are the things that I
can be grateful for instead of the
things I want instead of the things that
I wish I had instead of focusing on that
negative aspect turning it around and
focusing on the things that I am
grateful for and just being like I'm so
excited to eventually be here and still
looking forward and wanting to move on
maybe from that space but being in a
more positive headspace about it I think
is really important and I try every day
just to like remind myself of all the
amazing things that have happened in my
life all the amazing things to come in
my life and yeah so anyway
Yolo saying yes more I definitely think
I've been doing that I feel like the
biggest example of that so far this year
for me has been me going to Oregon I
went with my friend Amy because she
directed a film that I worked on as
makeup artist and she invited me to go
up to Oregon for the festival and it was
something that was definitely like
exciting and you want to do it but then
when it comes to the reality of it like
I'll be traveling alone we didn't fly
together I didn't have Sam with me which
is kind of this like comfort you know
zone type of thing I really I said yes
and just did it you know we booked the
tickets
I went had an amazing time you know I
was gone for almost a whole week and I'm
just really happy that I said yes to
that opportunity instead of letting some
of the other more unknown or maybe like
scary things kind of stop me from doing
it and I think pushing yourself to kind
of step outside of your boundaries in
your comfort zone a little bit in
positive ways obviously can be really
great and really like kind of open you
up to that next level that you want to
be at so I'm really grateful for that
and I want to obviously continue doing
that but I feel like I've been doing a
good job
I'm just saying yes more of experiencing
more things and I think that's really
exciting moving on to number three
number three I had talked about how I
wanted to make smart purchases and I
feel like I'm doing a good job of that I
will say this year I'm kind of like the
most away from project panning and kind
of like low buys and no buys and I've
ever been on my channel and I don't know
if I'm like growing out of it but I
definitely feel more distance from just
project panning in general I enjoy using
up my makeup
I enjoy truly using my collection and
not just buying things for the sake of
having more stuff but I definitely think
that I'm striking more of a balance in
my channel and just in my attitude
toward makeup I'm finally getting back
to a place where I feel like makeup is
just fun so if I want something I buy it
and I don't let myself get too guilty
about that which i think is really nice
like it's okay you know to want to buy
some things even if you have you know
ten flushes if you want a new blush and
you have the money and you've really
thought this purchase out and you you
wanted I don't think that you should
feel guilty and I think I'm just finally
at a place where makeup is fun again I'm
excited for new releases whether I buy
them or I don't I'm just kind of in a
better headspace when it comes to that
personally I think so that's been good
and I I feel like though I'm still
trying to be conscious of what I'm
buying making sure that it's gonna fit
my own collection and I hope with my
videos that I'm still passing on like
being a smart consumer to you guys as
well which I really do try to put into
my videos so I feel like I'm doing a
good job of that although I'm not
necessarily sticking to project panning
as much as I was I do have like some
little projects going on but I don't
have anything near like I used to I used
to have like quite a few projects going
on all at once and you know as much as
it's fun I really like just being
inspired and keeping the makeup fun and
fresh and just you know if I don't like
something or if I'm not using it just
being okay with passing it on and not
necessarily feeling like I need to get
my money's worth I need to like use it
until it's gone to feel satisfied I will
also say with that I've been doing a
really great job of just returning
things because in this video and for
this resolution it wasn't just about
make if it was just about things in my
life in general if I'm buying clothes
making sure that their clothes I'm gonna
actually love actually we're not just
buying things because oh I think I
should wear more color but it's like I
like black tank tops so I wear black
tank tops and just being okay with that
and just buying for myself and knowing
myself and I've been doing a really good
job of just returning things that didn't
work for me but also just being a better
consumer
in the store and really taking note of
like okay will I use this how often will
I use this am i buying this just because
I want to buy something right now or am
i buying this for a purpose is it
filling a hole or a gap that's in my
clothing or in my household or something
like that and I've been really happy
with that number four I talked about
wanting a healthy mind and a healthy
body
you know the classic New Year's
resolutions at least when it comes to
healthy body and I feel like I've been
doing a pretty good job I'm not as great
as I really wanted to be when it comes
to losing weight but I have lost ten
pounds this year and I've been
maintaining that I've been doing Weight
Watchers with my mom and that's kind of
been in the last like basically since
the end of March or so so I'm really
happy about that
I want to obviously continue to work on
that and continue to lose weight but
something I'm really excited about is
the fact that I have been maintaining
that I'm still in a great headspace I'm
trying to just make better decisions
every time I get the chance to choose
what food I'm going to eat just making a
better choice and I feel like I have
definitely been doing better and been
more conscious about the food I'm
bringing into my body and that's been
really great when it comes to the
healthy mind I feel like that's been the
hardest struggle for me this year every
day is just a different day and so I've
been trying really hard to find ways to
stay positive or to kind of like just
feel better I put a lot of pressure on
myself when it comes to work and when it
comes to YouTube and just different
things and I definitely can get in my
head I definitely can feel just
depressed and just unmotivated even
though at the same time I have like a
million things to do and I'm so excited
and I want to do all those things and
then I end up like doing none of it I
feel like and it's just kind of this
cycle so I'm definitely still working on
that I don't feel like that has been as
great as I wish it could be but you know
I'm still hopeful and I'm still working
on that definitely something I'm still
trying to get under control and trying
to just feel really good about so I
definitely want to continue working on
that taking the steps I need to to make
sure that I just I want to not only with
YouTube but just in my life I want to be
at a place where I'm making decisions
I'm
creating things in a great headspace and
so yeah that's something I definitely
still want to continue working on number
five on my list this was to travel more
and to explore more and so it didn't
necessarily only mean like taking big
trips but just you know going on more
day trips being more spontaneous and not
just like being at the house or doing
your normal routine and I feel like me
and Sam done an amazing job of that this
year this year is like the crazier we're
just like yellow every second because
I'm going to Italy you guys know that I
feel like when this video goes up I
might be in Italy I'm not sure what I'm
gonna put this up I might make this one
of my pre film video so if I am in Italy
or even if not you guys should check out
my Instagram because I will be doing
some Instagram stories over there you
guys want to see what I'm up to what I'm
doing I'm really excited about that I've
never done an Instagram story so I
probably need to figure that out
but if you want to see pictures and kind
of stay up to date in real time with me
definitely go check out my Instagram so
we're going to Italy this summer for
three weeks I'm so excited about that
and it should be just a fun trip we're
so close for like two weeks away from it
and oh I'm so like I'm kind of nervous
but I'm like excited nervous so that's
going to just be an amazing time and I
cannot wait like I had mentioned earlier
I travel to Oregon earlier this year me
and Sam have been back to Arizona quite
a few times we've also made a couple
like spontaneous trips to Vegas which
have been fun and then I think the other
trip that we know for sure we have set
in stone we're going to England in
October to go see a play and yeah just
to enjoy our anniversary it'll be our
eleven year anniversary together so
that'll be kind of fun kind of fun it's
gonna be freaking a blast and amazing so
I feel like we definitely have been
trying to explore more we've also just
been more spontaneous taking like you
know trips
we're definitely people who will drive
our favorite coffee place is in Anaheim
or at least it's my favorite coffee
place and it's called the loop churro
they sell churros and they do all these
like amazing drinks and so me and Sam
just randomly will like drive down there
just to just to get a coffee the other
day they came out with all these new
lemonade's I'm gonna leave their
Instagram linked down below if you guys
want to check it out because I'm like
I'm like weirdly obsessed with this
place anyway so um they came out with a
bunch of new lemonade so we went and got
all the new lemonade's and each of
coffee for us all so we could taste
samal I don't know just being more
spontaneous and exploring more in that
way it's been really fun so yeah I feel
like we're doing we're we're like a plus
plus on that one we're winning teacher's
pet okay and last I had mentioned some
kind of YouTube goals and I had talked
about wanting to grow my channel and
since that video my channel has grown
which i think is really really awesome I
I still it like blows my mind that I'm
at 58 thousand subscribers and I just I
can't believe that it's like crazy and I
just want to I'm always so grateful I'm
so thankful and I appreciate each and
every one of you watching my videos
liking commenting just you know
supporting my channel it's amazing and I
really really appreciate it I think more
where I'm going for now when it comes to
my channel as much as I want to grow and
that's amazing I really my main focus I
want to be on is just kind of just on my
channel not that I don't want to worry
about what other people are doing but
you know I just want to I just want to
like cuddle my channel right now and I
really want to make sure that I'm
creating content that I'm super
passionate about videos that I'm really
proud of I've been doing daily uploads
basically all year so far I've kind of
had more of a sporadic upload situation
since I got sick and I've had a gig and
then going into Italy and so these might
be kind of every other day and I'm kind
of okay with that right now we'll see
when I get back from Italy if we go back
to daily uploads or if we kind of stay
at like five ish videos a week that's
kind of what I'm thinking right now it's
not that I don't have a ton of video
ideas because I do I'd mentioned and
like to get ready with me how I had sat
down and like wrote out like a hundred
different video ideas so that I could
have you know just so that I could have
a place where I could just refer to
content when I wasn't feeling as
inspired and I think I just want to make
sure that the videos that I'm putting up
I'm not only putting up an idea that I'm
excited about but you know that it's a
good video and I'm not just filming
something to put a video up that day not
that I've done that in the past but I
just I just want to really make that a
focus I want to feel passionate about
each video about each idea that I'm
putting up I want to make sure that
they're great reviews and with that
something else that I want to make sure
is that I want to make sure that just
YouTube is super fun to me and something
that I just feel excited about purely
excitement purely just you
no happy and wanting to do for the fun
of it I don't want to feel pressure I
don't want to feel any of those things
like I feel like those are things I can
kind of like slowly kill you
and slowly kill your passion and I just
want to make sure that I'm really
fending myself off from that and that
whatever I'm uploading it's just fun and
I'm not overthinking anything and I love
doing reviews I love telling you guys
about makeup but I feel like sometimes I
can even get in my head about that I
want to make sure I get like the best
review possible and the best this ever
and that kind of can almost stop me from
like getting the video up at all you
know because I just feel like well I
could test it a little bit longer and so
just making sure again I guess going
back to the idea of balance but having
that balance having something I'm
passionate about I want it to be good
quality and all of these things but at
the same time it's still fun I'm still
passionate it's not that serious I think
that's like a big thing and you know
just I want to be able to just have fun
on my channel and keep that going so
yeah that's definitely I mean it's what
I talked about there but I think just a
lot more emphasis on on what I said
right now all right guys so I thought
this was just like a fun talk video I
hope you enjoyed it I hope if anything
you know maybe it can get you thinking
about where you want to be in your life
what do you want to do whether it comes
to your career your family hobbies I
don't know I don't know what you want to
do but you know I think it's important
to have a plan and just to be motivated
to hopefully reach some goals and create
stuff I think about it all the time and
I always bring it back to YouTube
because this is something in my life
that when I was living in Arizona
I was watching so much YouTube and I was
you know always thinking like oh man I
would love to have a channel I would
love to have a channel and when I think
about where I am today the fact that I'm
in LA I do makeup for a living I have a
YouTube channel that is I feel like
really successful and I think that's so
cool and like I just it blows my mind
the fact that I went to a covergirl
event or you know any of those things
they're just things I couldn't have
fathomed before and I know it all
started with like little baby steps to
get me here and when I think about the
hard work I've put into my channel when
I had 19 subscribers 100 subscribers 300
subscribers and all of that I just you
know you put that ground
again and I really think that anything
is possible but yeah I just I hope it
inspires you to go after whatever it is
you want I think that there's so much in
this world there's so much money in this
world there's something that you want to
do and you want to make it your career I
think you can do it with some hard work
dedication putting some plans into
action I think that it's attainable so
anyway hope it inspires you I hope you
guys enjoyed the video and thank you
guys so so much for watching I will see
you guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
