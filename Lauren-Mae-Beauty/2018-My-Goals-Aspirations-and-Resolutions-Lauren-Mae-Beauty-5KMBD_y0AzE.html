Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk about my 2018 and
goals and resolutions I did this video
last year and I think I might have even
done it the year before that I've been
on YouTube almost three years it'll be
three years in February and this is
something I like to do not only for my
channel and just for you guys and
talking about this because I think it's
fun but because I like to go back and
look at these things it is definitely
interesting to go back and look at last
year's video for my makeup alone oh so
I'm gonna talk about what I had in that
video or at least touch on it briefly
and then I'm gonna talk about what I am
doing this year things that are really
important to me and things that I want
to bring into the new year I think
something that's important to say is
just like I don't think you need the new
year to start a new thing or to make
change in your life it could be any day
it doesn't even have to be a Monday
doesn't have to be the start of anything
if the start is you doing it from that
moment and continuing it on but I do
think that the new year is an amazing
start I mean it does feel good have a
fresh clean slate 2018 so I get that as
well so yeah let's just get into it
without without rambling too much
because lord knows I will ramble don't
worry if you like that it's coming so my
goals for 2017 one of them was to stop
apologizing that was like a really big
thing I was focusing on I definitely
think I did a good job on working on
that for me it was like apologizing in
my real life and saying sorry when I
didn't mean it instead of being like oh
excuse me or a part of me or I'm trying
to pass by I would be like oh sorry oh
sorry and I just didn't want that to be
a continuing thing that I say I'm sure I
still say it but I don't feel as
passionate about that as I don't think
that's as much of an issue for me
anymore I do think though that
apologizing when it comes to YouTube is
something I still want to work on that
was something I had mentioned there and
as my channels growing I think that's
going to be a very important thing for
me to keep in my mind because it's just
a lot I have a lot of new subscribers
which is amazing and so great and I'm so
incredibly excited
but I think you know staying true to
myself and just being me and not
apologizing all the time and not letting
the fact that morons are watching it and
so then just in general more opinions
are gonna be in the mix really get to me
and change me so yeah that was one of my
old ones another one that I had for 2017
was to say yes and make things happen
and that is actually carrying on into
2018 so we'll get to that I'm not gonna
really talk about it too much another
thing that I had talked about was
growing my channel I was pretty frank
and open about the fact that I you know
as much as I love YouTube and make it a
hobby it would be amazing for it to be a
source of income and I am happy to say
that it is definitely a more of a source
of income than it was at the beginning
of the year which is so amazing I'm so
incredibly thankful it's great to have
another source of income since I do gig
work as many gigs as I can get I'm happy
with so YouTube is kind of just like one
of my gigs and then last I talked about
wanting to plan a trip and I did not
plan a trip for Australia or New Zealand
which is something I had mentioned in
that video but me and Sam are going to
Italy next summer with his family and it
will be pretty fun so I'm excited about
that we have that in the books and that
is very exciting I'm glad we could make
that happen we have our hotels booked so
yeah it's a real thing it's in stone a
little bit okay now let's talk about my
resolutions this year I'm gonna leave
that video link down below because if
you really want to like see something
cringy I suggest checking it out and
that's gonna segues into my first
resolution for this year is to stay
teachable I think that's a really
important thing as you grow as a person
as you get older and you feel like you
know more about the world as I grow on
my YouTube channel like it has so many
applications but just staying teachable
and never feeling like you know
everything being able to listen to
someone to hear them out maybe they have
a different solution or opinion that can
help you grow and learn and you never
know everything so I think staying
teachable is really important perfect
examples check out my brows in that
video like my makeup in general in that
video was so cringy guys when I went
back to watch it I was just like oh my
lord help me help me and you know and
then the fact that I obviously was a
working makeup artist back then but like
I'm doing makeup on people and that's on
my brows alike so just stay teachable
you know you never know when you're
gonna look back and be like oh Lord
so yeah that is my number one thing that
I want to carry with me throughout 2018
and I want to remind myself of and
hopefully when I get in situations where
maybe I'm feeling conflicted or
confronted I can remember that sentiment
to be like you know what Lauren maybe
you don't know everything like calm it
down let your pride down and maybe learn
something number two this goes in to my
say yes more but just in general hashtag
Yolo I know that this is like one of the
silliest like Latin most laughable like
hashtags and like phrases but honestly
it is the realest phrase of life like
that's the irony of it Yolo you only
live once baby and then you die and I
know that sounds morbid and I know that
sounds sad and it is kind of sad but
it's true its life and so because of
that you got to make every moment count
and that is we're saying yes more comes
into play we're making things happen I
want to live more I want to do more I
want to try not to make excuses and even
if I'm tired you know push past and make
an experience happen because that's what
you remember at the end of the day if
you don't remember the times when you
said no I don't want to do that and you
stayed in and slept or you watched and
binge just show instead you remember the
time that you guys me and Sam drove all
the way to this place on a winnin or
whatever it was or the time you hung out
with friends and had this great
experience so that is something that I
definitely want to continue on doing in
2018 and just don't like my whole life I
wanted Yolo alright next number three I
have six different things just in case
you were wondering but number three is I
want to make smart purchases and this is
something that was a really big focus of
my channel especially from the beginning
I started out as a project panner and
then as I transitioned into a makeup
artist full-time there was this kind of
like well I'm buying things for my kit
and I need to have new makeup
but trying to like pan things and not
buy things and now I feel like I'm at a
really good place I love where my
channels at I love that I try to just
you know have a bit of balance I buy
things but I don't buy everything and I
like to just kind of make videos and
talk about ideas that hopefully strike
balance in you guys and make you you
know reconsider purchases and it's not
to be negative it's just to be more
realistic because YouTube can create a
big frenzy and a really false world of
like all these new things and you guys
know it's like my entire stick on my
channel so yeah I'd really want to make
smart purchases this year not only when
it comes to beauty items but when it
comes to clothing when it comes to house
we're just in general what I'm spending
my money on are gonna be quality things
that I'm going to use and love and that
I need if I need clothes actually buying
clothes hello but buying clothes I know
I'm gonna wear if you guys see my
Instagram you guys know that I wear the
same shirt every day because I love that
shirt I tell Sam all the time as soon as
we have any money I'm gonna make sure
it's not for you guys like not merch no
I'm gonna make myself shirts with like
rap phrases on them different route
phrases and those are gonna be my shirts
every day there's gonna be black tank
tops like this with you know different
phrases and those are gonna be the
shirts I wear every day because that's
what I like I don't give a crap what
anyone says okay I think that would be
like I would feel so confident and cute
in those every single day and people
would think that I'm wearing the same
shirt but like it's not it's a different
phrase hello anyway so making sure our
purchases is definitely something I want
to focus on I want to like question
myself before I make these purchases and
yeah try not to bring just into my
life in Sigma number 4 is a healthy mind
and healthy body now we all knew that
the healthy body thing was coming
everyone's goal at the new year is like
get healthy and lose weight and I'm
pretty sure that's like it just is it's
everyone's goal it's everyone's
intention and I really do want to try to
be healthy I've talked about this before
and it's always scary talking to the
internet about this crap because it
great to be held accountable but at the
same time like we're all humans and you
say you're gonna do something and then
you fail and then you just feel like an
even shittier person because you failed
and 25,000 people know about it but
anyway that is something like just being
healthier making healthier choices on
the daily and does that mean like going
insanely drastic I don't know I don't
know what that means for me I don't have
rules laid out I don't know if I'm gonna
make videos about that just to keep some
things personal so in general with food
I would love to do that I am plus-sized
and as much as I love myself and Who I
am
I want to be healthy for myself I want
to be healthy for my family I want to be
able to do more I want to be able to go
a little longer and yeah so that is one
part of that but the other part is a
healthy mind and I am someone who deals
with a lot of anxiety I feel like most
youtubers do because I think there's
like a certain type of person I just you
know is attracted to some help
videotaping yourself and posting it
online but I do deal with a lot of
anxiety and I am working on you know
trying to get in a better headspace and
trying to take care of myself mentally
and I think that's really important and
I'm not sure what that means for me
whether that's just talking things out
more potentially going and seeing a
counselor or whatever that means um I
really want to make that a focus of this
year I want to be as productive as
possible and you have to have a sound
mind to do that and so I would love to
just be at an optimal level for that and
working towards a really good healthy
mind and healthy body number five one of
my goals is just to travel more and
explore you guys know I love to travel
like the thing is it's funny because all
of these goals are the same as last year
because these are my loves and the
things that I appreciate and actually
care about when it comes to the big
picture of life but I do want to travel
more and that doesn't mean me
necessarily going on like lavish trips
but doing day trips or exploring the
city I live in you know going to little
places we did a pop-up earlier this year
and that one cost money so not
everything has to
money there can be free stuff I just
really want to explore and be active in
that way and seeing things and that's a
really big goal in mind for 2018 and
then last I kind of touched on this but
with YouTube um you know I think it
would be just false of me not to mention
that I have holes when it comes to
YouTube and now that my channels at
where it's at which is incredible and
unbelievable it makes me so hopeful for
the future and where my channel could go
and so I do I hope that I can continue
to grow on this platform I think that
would be an amazing step in my life and
like it's called a platform because it's
like a jumping-off point there's so many
possibilities with it so that would be
absolutely amazing for me I want to
continue to upload quite frequently I
love daily uploading I don't personally
like having a schedule because like life
is you know my life is not online as
much as I love doing YouTube and I post
a lot like I don't want YouTube do
become my life it's not my life it's a
part of my life and so I do want to
continue to try to daily upload if not
like every other day so hopefully my
average throughout the year can be every
other day if not more I want to try to
list my makeup in the description boxes
because now that there are so many
people I get a lot of comments like
asking about my makeup and all of that
and at least if I don't do a tutorial on
it because I'm not gonna do a tutorial
and every single look that I do it's
just I don't have enough time to film
that many videos and as much as I like
doing some tutorials there's a part of
me that enjoys doing my makeup on my own
and not necessarily on camera so I don't
want to just only do tutorials and
anyway I'm like getting off on a tangent
there but I do want to have the makeup
listed so you guys can recreate it or at
least know what products I'm using and I
don't always answer my comments because
that is something that's like kind of a
boundary for me it's kind of two things
it's anxiety inducing for me just in
general all the comments but it also is
just kind of a boundary of mine
I already dedicate so much time to
YouTube
comes to editing and filming and I don't
want this to seem harsh but it's just a
lot for me to then on top of that
respond to a million comments and feel
like I have to like respond to every
person who comments so just know that I
read all the comments and I appreciate
them so much I'm saying it again in this
video because I love to reiterate that
but I want to try to give you as much
information in my description box as I
possibly can so that you guys can have
as much information as possible and then
in general with YouTube too it's just as
much as I'm growing I still want to be
myself I want to continue to be creative
I want to come up with new series I want
to continue some of my old ones until I
feel like they've kind of played out or
I'm kind of just over them I want to be
passionate about my channel and the
content that I'm producing I don't want
to feel stale ever so if there's like a
mega switch up that's because um it's
all about me being excited about the
content that I'm creating I think that's
what comes across in videos well and
yeah what makes it work you know you
don't want to make content about things
you don't like I'm not saying that I'm
tired or anything right now I'm just
saying like I want to make sure that
throughout the year that is a continuing
focus and that I'm not creating videos
just for views necessarily like it's
great if you get a lot of views and you
also love that video that's like the
winning combination and like the golden
egg but yeah I don't know I think I
think we're good here so those are my
2018 goals and resolutions I'm so
excited for 2018 every year you get a
year older huh and um I don't know for
me there's a lot of excitement going
into the new year with on a personal
level and I am excited to see what 2018
holds and excited to just work hard and
see what we can make out of this year so
thank you so much for watching guys
leave some of your resolutions maybe
down below I think it's always
interesting to see what other people
care about and again I love reading your
comments so thank you so much for
watching thank you so much for
everything and I will see you in the New
Year a ton in the new year bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
