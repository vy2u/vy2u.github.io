Lauren this is going to be a new toy a
video on my channel this is for looks
one pallet a lot of you guys in my
honest favourites said he wanted to see
a look with the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
modern renaissance palette this is an
awesome palette I know it can be kind of
scary looking because there are a lot of
like really red tones obviously but I
thought I'd be fun to put together for
different looks for you guys using this
palette some of them are a little more
intense some of them are a little more
creative and I hope it just gives you
some ideas to play around with if you
own the palette you could also of course
just use shadows that are similar to
this or even just get inspired using
different shadows in your watch and from
this type of video so let me know down
below if there's any other palettes that
you guys know I have or that you want me
to do this type of video with I think
it'd be really fun that spoiler I did
get the dose of colors ice cream palette
and I'm gonna do like a swatch video on
it so if you want to see a four looks
one palette with that palette let me
know down below or any palette just let
me know and let's just get into the
looks I hope you guys enjoy okay so
let's get started obviously we're gonna
be using the modern renaissance palette
and today i'm gonna be going for a look
using beyond fresco don't know how to
say that i'm also going to be using
antique bronze and this kind of golden
shimmery shade called primavera
those are gonna be kind of a main focus
i might bring in a couple other shades
so i'm hoping with all four looks i can
get every single one of these shadows
used on my eyes so that way you could
see every shadow in action so the first
thing i'm gonna do is take tempera to
ferrah
i don't know i'm really really bad with
like pronouncing things but i'm gonna
take that and just apply it from my brow
bone all the way to my lashline i do
this with every look i do
I hope my inner face makeup looks okay
we're pretty zoomed in here guys so I'm
gonna take a fluffy blending brush and
I'm first gonna go in I think to warm
taupe this would also be a great shade
to use on the brows if you need like an
ashy blonde or a light brown type of
color I think I'd look really good
anyway I'm gonna just like start my
transition with that and you just want
to go kind of lightly now that I have
that blended out I'm gonna take the
beyond beyond fresco the shade and it's
all matte I'm gonna put that on my
tire lit and into the crease and kind of
blended into warmth oh I'm thinking I'm
gonna try to do like a halo eye today I
know usually you leave the middle part
open but I'm not doing once you have
that I'm going to take a different
blending brush with a little bit of that
product on it for that same color I'm
gonna blend it into the crease I don't
know what it is like this portion right
here you see this it just does not like
hold color very well or at least not the
same as everything else I don't
understand once you have that blended
out I'm gonna take the gold shape the
Primavera shade and I'm gonna take this
one this is just that short smudger
brush but since it's densely packed you
feel like it compact color on and I'm
also gonna take my mac fix+ and spray
the brush down before I go in with that
color just so I get the most pigmented
application possible I'm just gonna
focus is on the center of the eye
because I'm gonna try to do that whole
halo thing or whatever you could easily
just put this like all over your like
lid and then just deepen out the outer
corner with the antique bronze which is
what I'm gonna do next but I just wanted
to try something different I kind of
kept it to the center kind of so we're
gonna take a smaller brush we'll take
this one for now this is just a Tarte
one but it's like a more dense rounded
brush so I'm gonna take the color
antique bronze here and we're just gonna
use that to deepen up the inner and
outer corner again just making that halo
really pop
I'm just gonna go in again with that
like fresco color we're just gonna call
it fresco I'm gonna just blend out some
of this I just feel like it's looking a
little dark I'm just gonna go in and
deepen the antique color just like right
at the inner corner just so I get that
darkness and now I'm just gonna go back
in with the primavera color and just
make sure that that pop of color is
really bright on the very very center of
the lid I'm just kind of Pat out to
blend and then I'm just doing my best to
get the best blend I possibly can I
thought that I would kind of amp this up
I'm gonna put a little bit of glitter on
the center of my eye this is a gold
glitter from Urban Decay it's a little
more yellowy though I thought this would
just kind of like step this look up a
little obviously if you don't have
glitter you don't have to do that I just
wanted it to be a little bit more just a
little more volume I got it on my
glitter now I'm going to go in and
tightline with my Urban Decay Roche
liner I'm just gonna put it underneath
and put a little bit on the lower lash
line and smudge it so I'll be right back
now I'm gonna go in with just a little
angled brush this one's a little bit
more fluffy though I'm gonna take that
fresco color I'm just gonna smudge that
underneath the lash line and I'm just
gonna connect it into penny shadow
that's low enough to connect it to and
if you really wanted to you could add
that darker color the antique bronze I'm
gonna do it just a little bit on the
very most outer corner for my inner
corner highlight I'm gonna go in with
the colors ramires putting in it so
that's everything for this look actually
what I'm gonna do is swatch these really
fast so you guys could see what my color
palette was and I was working one and
then with my other looks I found I'm
just gonna show you swatches of the
colors I'm using disapperance you can
kind of get an idea of the color palette
in working life when you see them all
together like this it's sometimes hard
to separate them but anyway so those are
swatches of what I have on my eyes not
including my inner corner highlight and
just looking at that compared to what's
in the palette it's definitely a
different look I thought I would show
you that and I'll do that from now on
let me put some mascara on I'll show you
the finished look okay guys this is the
final look for look one yeah that's my
first look
hi guys welcome to look - for today's
look I wanted to do something
incorporating the red the orange as well
as this dark Cypress and then I think
I'm gonna use Vermeer as like my lid
shade so that's kind of the look we're
gonna do
I might blend though a little that
orange like into my brow first off I'm
gonna take this shade here this is
tempera and I'm going to put this all
over my eyelid now I'm gonna take a
fluffy blending brush and I'm going to
go into this color here golden ochre and
I'm just gonna start doing like a really
basic transition type of shade and just
buff that into the crease I feel like
this one's probably one of the like most
powdery shades I don't know what it is
when I put my brush in it it just kind
of explodes now that we have a light
transition down I'm actually just gonna
go straight in with the lid color so I'm
gonna go in with this shade here and I'm
going to just put that all over the lid
I feel like keeping the like actual lid
having just a kind of basic color makes
the rest of the look not seem so
unwearable I'm gonna take the color red
ochre and I'm just gonna start buffing
that on the outer half of my eye and
definitely tap this shade out I want it
to be kind of intense but we're gonna
kind of ground it with that Brown too
and I kind of want the darkest amount of
color to be at the lower lash line then
kind of blend your way up I suggest
doing your foundation faster on this one
just because the reds are kind of
intense and I'm really just packing it
on that outer corner because I was gonna
go with Brown but I think I'm just gonna
go in with the brown on the lower lash
line instead so I really want this red
to kind of have varying amounts of
intensity now that I have that on I'm
gonna go in with that fluffy blending
brush again and just kind of blend over
the outside edges and just try to make
it look a little softer I'm having that
same area they don't understand why it
does that but it does every time I'm now
gonna go in with this same no I'm gonna
take a different blending brush why not
I'm gonna go with a different blending
brush I'm gonna take the orange color
I'm gonna buff it into this portion I
like to work it into the brown too but I
just want the most intensity just right
at the base of the brow and
to the other eye too obviously if you
don't like this step you don't have to
do it this is just different looks I
would do with this palette I'm gonna
take that golden ochre color and I'm
just gonna blend out the edges of this
color I'm hoping to bring a little bit
more of that golden kind of color back
and then I'm gonna go in and stamp just
more of that red on the very outside
corners we can get a really intense red
from it and I'm gonna go in with yet
another clean blending brush and this
one's a little bit tinier I'm just going
to the outside edges to blend that out I
don't I want to keep the intensity so I
don't want to blend it out too much just
so that it doesn't look too hard yeah
I'm gonna go back in with the lid shade
Vermeer and I'm just going to pack that
on the inner portion of the lid and
bring some of that brightness back and
we're just gonna kind of blend it into
the red and then I decided I want this
orange juice to be a little bit more
orange a so I'm gonna go in with burnt
orange and see if that kind of adds just
a different tone for right now I'm gonna
go in and highlight my brow bone with
the original matte nude shade and then
for my inner corner I'm gonna go in with
the primavera shade which is the gold
shimmery shade this is definitely not a
look for everyone I feel very like a
dragon we're watching Game of Thrones so
I feel very dragon a skin those and then
just to make sure that these two colors
are blended I'm gonna go back in with
the one I was kind of like stamping and
just kind of stamp out the edge with no
new product I'm just using whatever was
on there I'm gonna go grab my concealer
and Beauty Blender really fast for my
concealer I'm just using the Maybelline
master conceal and light and I'm just
gonna use a little bit of that just kind
of clean up the edge I'm going to
tightline using my Urban Decay liner in
Roche I also put a little bit of that
underneath the lash line and smudge it
out with my fingers for the rest of the
lash line I'm actually gonna go in and
just take a look not too precise of a
little brush that's a really good
description I'm gonna go into the color
Cyprus umber and I'm gonna top a lot of
that off and I'm just gonna use this to
go underneath my lash line today since
it's pretty intense on top I don't want
to take too much red underneath now I'm
gonna go in with mascara and just add
quite a bit because I'm not gonna do
falsies you guys know I don't really do
falsies very often but I'm just going to
add quite a bit just so that I can get
some good definition to kind of ground
this look okay guys that is the final
look I hope you like this one I hope you
enjoyed it and let's go on to luck
number three hi guys are back with look
three for the modern renaissance palette
I realized that I did not swatch the
colors from my last look someone just
walked in real fast so you can see them
on my hand then we'll get into this look
so those are the main colors I used I
was really focusing on these top three
then we have the shiny shade on the lid
understand it's used as like a
transition definitely very fall you
could do these shadows in different ways
than what I did and like in different
placements and I did in the last look
and I think it'd look really great yeah
that's that and now for today's look I'm
going to be doing just a simple look
using basically these two shadows and
that's kind of it I might deepen up the
lower lash line and use something like
that but what I love about this look is
this is the simplest one it's all mad
and it's basically just putting one
color all over the lid I also really
like this look with the fresco color I
think it just looks really nice you
could basically do this look with any of
these shadows I think it'd look really
nice let me just watch it and show you
what the swatches look like all together
that's kind of it really basic this is
kind of my go-to look out of the palette
just for everyday I'm gonna be on set a
little bit later today so it kind of
works out perfect for me today so first
thing as always I'm gonna go in with the
Mac cream shade and just put that all
over the lid from the brow bone to the
lash line I'm trying really hard not to
whisper to you guys on this one I feel
like the last when I was very whispery
it's really because I was filming at a
different time of day and a lot more
people were home and I felt like a
little weird or something I don't know I
was just whispering sweet nothings to
you on how to do that eyes look I'm
gonna go in with the lighter of the two
and the more oranjee this is burnt
orange and I'm just gonna put that in my
crease and once you have that kind of
blended on to the crease I just kind of
keep taking it down and we're gonna take
this color all the way down to the lash
line as well to do that I'm actually
going to switch my brushes this is just
kind of like it's a medium angled shader
brush from Sigma same color the burnt
orange and
just going to kind of Pat and swipe onto
my eye if you wanted something less
orange I'd go with raw Sienna you could
even do this with the golden ochre color
if you wanted something even more basic
and then depending on your skin tone you
can go deeper and it probably won't look
as intense
I'm just very fair so now I'm gonna go
in with raw Sienna and I'm gonna put
that on the lower portion of the eyelid
just to kind of deepen it up give it a
little bit more like depth so it looks
like there's a little bit of a gradation
of color I'm gonna go back in and blend
using the bright lime color with that
same blender brush just make sure it's
really seamless this is gonna be like
the easiest look I think this would be a
really good like staple fall look to it
just works really well I'm gonna go in
with my smudger brush I'm gonna take the
burnt um no I always want to call it
burnt number but it's Cypress umber and
it's the darkest shade here I'm gonna
just put this on the very outer corner
at the lash line this is just gonna give
the illusion that my lashes are a little
bit thicker than they are I don't always
do this but I figured for the sake of a
look I would and it can be a little like
smudgy messy that's kind of how I like
it I'm going to put a little bit of the
matte cream color under the brow bone
and then I'm gonna go in and just blend
it again for the inner corner I'm gonna
go in with Vermeer you can also just go
in with that matte color if you wanted
to keep this all matte I think that look
really nice too I'm gonna go in and
tight line as well as line my lower lash
line with the urban decay liner in Roche
you guys know the drill for my lower
lash line I'm gonna go in with the color
raw Sienna which is like the darker of
the two shades we use and I'm gonna just
budge the underneath on top of that
liner just hurt a little bit of
definition or a little bit of warmth
usually I would stop there and I feel
like this is going so fast I'm so happy
for the video usually what's up there
but I think I'm gonna do a little bit of
a wing today I guess I didn't really
think that through with the brown shadow
but I just kind of I'm feeling it today
so I'm gonna try to do this a little
winged I might try to keep this on
camera and just speed it up but I also
don't want to mess up so we'll see I'm
just gonna go for it
you
and as always my little wing turned into
Amy Winehouse real fast I think this is
even and whatever is it's gonna get
today so we're just gonna go with it
let's just move on to mascara this is
the Smashbox x-rated and I'm just going
to load up my lashes top and bottom with
this okay guys so this is the final look
for look three I hope you guys enjoyed
this is super simple
that's everything and I will see you
guys and look for this is look for this
is going to be probably the most intense
look out of all them really close up so
don't mind me half in the screen and
half not and don't mind the fact that I
have no makeup on I learned my lesson
and I'm definitely going to do my eye
makeup first on this one so the look
we're doing today is going to be using
the color love letter the nation red and
probably some of burnt orange I feel
like once we use those colors we'll use
everything in the palette so I really
feel like the look we're gonna do today
it's kind of the epitome of this palette
in general like it's what I was the most
excited for in the palette let's just
get going
we can all say it together I'm gonna
take a fluffy brush and take the matte
cream shade and just put it from my brow
bone down to my lashline I already did
my brows because I feel like it just
kind of frames my eye and gives me a
better idea of what I'm working with so
before I do I makeup I like to have my
brows done next I'm gonna take this
blending brush and I'm going to take the
color burnt orange and I'm just going to
put that in my crease as a transition
this is a version of a look I did in my
Instagram post and you guys really
seemed to like it it was kind of the
inspiration even for this for looks one
palette so I hope you guys like it this
is similar to yesterday's look but we're
using just different colors it's kind of
like that smokey eye where its darkest
at the lashline
kind of blends out from there I feel
like Venetian red and love-letter look
very similar but love-letter is
definitely my favorite oh shoot I keep
forgetting I'll let me swatch the colors
for you so that's kind of the palette
but love-letter is this one here I just
like this one better it's a little more
vibrant so that's the color I really
want to focus on so I'm going to take
Venetian red first and I'm going to kind
of make even more of a transition I'm
not gonna go as high as I did with that
Brown I'm just gonna try to keep it
below it so that way we can get a nice
gradient effect and because I'm gonna do
my makeup last I'm not really gonna
worry about fallout once you have less
product on your brush you can kind of
blend that more into the brown now I'm
gonna take the color love-letter I'm
using a dense kind of shader synthetic
shader brush this is a concealer brush
technically but I'm gonna use it for
shadows so I picked up some color and
I'm just going to be patting that on
look at that color that is crazy and see
how this is just a little bit more just
more this color is extra I'm gonna just
put that just on the lid and then we'll
blend out the edges with that Venetian
red
now I'm going back in with a fluffy
brush we used earlier with the color
Venetian red and I'm going to be
blending out the edges of this color and
just try to keep it right at the seam
because we're gonna go back in with that
burnt orange color to blend out even a
little higher so don't take it too far
up if you have blue or green eyes this
look will definitely bring out the color
of your eyes there is red everywhere but
let's continue gonna take the color
burnt orange back on the original fluffy
blending brush and just kind of go on
the outer edges just trying to make it a
little more seamless now I'm gonna go
back in with the color love-letter and
just make sure that again closest to the
lash line we have the most pigmentation
on that and then we'll just barely blend
that out now that we're here I'm gonna
take the creamy matte shade I'm gonna
put that right under the brow bone and
I'm gonna bring it in a little bit too
because some of those colors got blended
up and then I'm gonna take the original
blending brush and more of the blood
orange and just kind of blend that out a
little I could go back and forth for
days and you can go back and forth
between blending as much as you want but
once you get to a place that you like
this is the time that I like to wipe
away and you fall out but since we
really got in there with the pink I'm
going as far up to the lashline as I can
to really make sure that I get all the
pigment off my face I'm gonna go do my
base foundation and then we'll come back
and finish the eyes okay guys I am back
I have my face on I will leave all the
products listed down below of what I
used let's finish up these eyes because
I'm looking kind of crazy first thing
I'm gonna go in and line with my Urban
Decay brooch liner and I'm going to
tightline and run a little bit on the
lower lash line and smudge it out with
my finger and something I think that's
really important to do with this look is
to there's a fly if you see it I'm so
sorry
something I think that's really
important to do with this look is to
line your inner rim with a nude pencil
or even a white pencil because there are
so many inky colors I kind of want to
get rid of any pink that might be
natural of my body so that way I can
just control how I look it's gonna just
make this look more purposeful and not
make you look I'm going to take
a angled brush that's a little fluffy
and I'm gonna go in with burnt orange
I'm keeping the lower lash line kind of
simple since we have so much going on on
the table I am gonna go in with a little
bit of the Venetian red and just put
that on the outer corner now for the
inner corner I'm going to take a pencil
brush I'm gonna spray it down with mac's
fix+
really get it like what because I really
want the inner corner to be like a
shining beacon so I'm gonna take the
color Vermeer from this palette really
put that right there I almost want it to
look kind of metallic so now I'm going
to go in with mascara I'm gonna do quite
a heavy coat because again I want the
lashes to really stand out against this
look okay guys that's the final look I
hope you guys enjoy I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video it took a lot of
time to make this because it's for
tutorials just in one video I'm really
happy with it I'm really happy with how
it turned out and I definitely want to
do more so again just leave any
suggestions down below let me know if
you like this video and I will see you
in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
