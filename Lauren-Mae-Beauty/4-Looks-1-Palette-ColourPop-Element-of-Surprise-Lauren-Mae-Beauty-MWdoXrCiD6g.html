Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I have a four looks one palette
for you guys this has been a long time
in the making and it is on the element
of surprise palette from colour-pop I
got this in my most recent boxycharm and
yeah I've been working on this for a
long time probably a good three weeks to
a month these are the hardest videos for
me to film because it's for looks and I
don't film usually more than one look in
a day because my eyes are sensitive and
so it's at least for filming days
specifically dedicated to just this it's
just a lot okay it's a lot but I am
excited to show you the looks that I've
created I will say that I film these all
at different times so yeah it's a little
bit jumbled I just did looks that I was
inspired to make using this palette I do
give a review at the end and I know this
video is going to be kind of long they
always tend to be because it's just so
much you know content so feel free to
skip around to things you want to see
I will leave timestamps down below the
look I'm wearing right now is the fourth
look I usually do my intro and outro in
my fourth look I think that's it I don't
want to make this too long so if you
want to see the four different looks
that I created using this palette then
just keep watching hopefully you like
them hello guys so we're gonna be
starting off look number one using the
element of surprise palette in my Tryon
video we use this purple so we'll use
that a little bit later probably today
I'm gonna be focusing on the pink and uh
I also want to use this shade here I'm
gonna do something with those and then
maybe that or maybe just this one no
probably that color see stars a little
bit of this peach and I think that's
gonna be it for this one so definitely
more of like a warm pink type of look
let's just get started though I have all
my base makeup done I have my eyebrows
done I have my eyes primed we're ready
to go we're gonna take the light peach
shade or I am I don't know if you guys
are doing this with me sometimes I go
with like we're doing it and then
sometimes I'm like no like I'm doing it
so sorry if I switch back and forth but
we right now we're just gonna be putting
that in the crease and just blending it
and I'm making sure to bring that inside
as well as all the way to the outside to
deepen that up I'm going to go in with C
stars which is like a nice
Brown and we're just going to be putting
this in the exact same place essentially
just slightly lower and again really
making sure we're working it onto the
inner portion of the eye as well as the
outer portion alright and then I'm just
going to make sure we go back in with
that lighter orange shade just to blend
everything out and hopefully get the
best blend we can so far I think that
looks pretty good I don't know let's
move in now I'm gonna just deepen up
this outer corner with this shade here
which I believe is a blank canvas for
that color I really want to work it into
the outer portion of the eye so I'm
putting it on like this Stamper brush
and I'm just going to make sure it's the
deepest on the outer corner and then
we'll go back in with seastars and kind
of make sure everything's as blended as
possible and again we're gonna blend out
with sea stars and also the peach just
trying to get that seamless blend next
I'm going in with a glitter glue this is
from NYX and I'm just going to be
putting this on to the blank part of the
lid just so that we have you know the
best base we possibly can for the next
shadows that we're gonna go in with and
I like to make sure I keep the glitter
glue like the most opaque or like with
the most product at the base of the lid
and then kind of tap out to blend up so
that way hopefully you don't have any
weird lines of demarcation where the
glitter glue kind of stopped and then
your shadow looks like funky I'm gonna
be starting off with the pink we're
putting that on the inner part of the
eye I packed it onto like a stiff flat
brush and hopefully that'll really take
nicely on that glitter glue and it is
this would be a really pretty like halo
eye to where you have like this on the
inner and outer and then this in the
middle that would be super pretty I'm
feeling like this pink is like really
just more pigmented than I thought based
off of initial swatches I'm pretty sure
I have the pink in a very similar place
but you can tell that there's a little
bit more like space on the lid for this
one so I'm just gonna go in you kind of
blend a little I'm gonna be flipping
this brush around and I'm going to be
using some mac fix+
I know we have the base down the glitter
blue but I do want this
metallic shade to be just as good as
possible so I'm going in with this one
here really pretty it's like a bit more
Orange II red and we're gonna be putting
that in the blank space of the oven I
honestly don't think you need to foil it
it really didn't change how it looks all
right so far I do like the way that
looks but I will say I feel like I need
like a deep brown to kind of like I
don't I just kind of tie in the end so
I'm gonna try going in with this brown
with golden sparkle hopefully the golden
Sparkle doesn't you know FS up too much
but I'm gonna be going in and just
deepening out this outer corner just so
there's enough of a difference between
the shades so that that like orangie
color really does show up alright now
I'm gonna go in with my fingers and
those two LEDs we use just kind of
reinforce them all right cool I kind of
like this I'm just gonna be doing some
blending on the outer edges just to like
try to make sure it's as blended as
possible I really like the way that's
looking next I want to go in to the
lower lash line and get that worked out
I'm gonna go into the orange first and
just run that under the whole lash line
and I think the color I want to drive
home the most is actually this one since
I mean the pink really just stands out
and of course my natural instinct is to
put the pink on the lower lash line but
I think if we can maybe bring out that
like orange shade it would look really
good so I'm gonna like buff that under
my whole eye and I'm gonna bring a bit
of this color in as well in the outer
corner and also that darker Brown for an
inner corner highlight today I'm gonna
go in with you highlight actually have
on my face just to tie it in and that is
Oprah's a pillow top it's the one in the
center I'm gonna spray my brush down
just so we get a really high shine
alright I hope we're even I'm like so
bad literally that's like my biggest
thing I'm bad at I feel like is my shape
and matching them but I think we're
decent that's always my goal like if I
can get a decent shape match that I'm
like okay fine
I'm gonna put some weight on my lower
lashline and put some mascara in my
lashes and I'll show you the final look
all right so this is the final look all
right I hope you guys enjoyed the final
look and let's move on to look number
two hi guys we're moving on to look
number two today using the element of
surprise palette from colour-pop today I
want to do something that's pretty basic
I have been really into basic eye looks
leniently this plane is gonna drama
crazy also please don't mind my makeup
I've been wearing it all day and then
I'm filming this at night so we're gonna
go in with this orange shade first it's
probably gonna be a big part of these uh
eye looks I did set my eyes with a
primer a while ago I was expecting to
film a little bit earlier today but
we're just gonna lay down a light
transition I'm just using a big fluffy
brush you know how I do my highlight is
crazy I'm testing out color pops
flexitarian and I will say well so today
I want to do like a monochromatic eye
look and then just really have like a
nice bright inner corner and just keep
that glowy look going and then to add
just like a little bit of fun I am going
to be adding a glittery gloss to the
lips and then I think I might add like
that little heart tattoo I don't know
just to spice it up I might like totally
ruin my look doing that but that was
kind of my idea today now that that's
completely laid down we're gonna go into
this shade here this has like almost a
rosy undertone to it but it's like a
mid-tone Brown and you can use any
mid-tone oh wow it's so much more pink
it really doesn't seem like it's gonna
be this pink when you see it in the pan
alright well we're going a lot more pink
than I had originally intended today
we're just putting this over the entire
lid though and then we'll be buffing it
into the crease into that orange and
that will be like the eye look um when
it goes for the lid so really really
simple
I know these tutorials are like supposed
to be inspiring but
no I think sometimes it's like that is
what we're doing like you know what I
mean like that is enough I don't think
you need to use like seven shades I
don't think you need to always have such
an intricate look for it to be beautiful
or for it to be something worth doing so
that's my two cents on it anyway
yeah this is so much more pink though I
will say I thought this is gonna be more
like a dusty mob Brown and it turned out
not like that okay I'm going in with a
fluffy brush and again that same color
we just put down all over the lid and
we're just working on having a nice
blend and then I'm also gonna dip back
into the orange just to add that to the
outer portion of the eye for under the
eye I'm gonna start off kind of the same
way I'm going in with the orange and
we're just gonna buff that underneath
and I'm buffing it pretty loosely I mean
that's pretty low this look is gonna be
a lot more like like sickly looking than
I had intended just so you guys know but
my eyes will pop now I'm gonna add in
the other brown or what color is this
it's called labyrinth and I'm gonna be
putting that closest to the lashline and
just blending into the orange while
we're at this stage I'm gonna go in with
the hot pink and I have just a fluffy
brush and where I want to put that heart
which is like right here I just want to
lay down just like hot pink face and
just blend it out I feel like that went
on a little bit more pigmented than I
had intended but I just wanted kind of
this hot pink haze to surround the heart
for the inner corner I'm gonna be going
in with a pencil brush I'm gonna spray
it down with a setting spray pretty
pretty hard because we're gonna go in
with this duochrome pink here it's like
a white but it has a duochrome
to it and I want this to show up as
intensely as possible I'm also gonna put
some of this over this pink to calm it
down a little
I don't know if I like this step but
we're kind of committed at this point um
okay so
that's where we're at so far I guess
we'll go in with the milk stamp biggest
thing with this you want to make sure
your turned the heart the way you want
it and then you pray a little so
hopefully it goes right I'm nervous
boom it's not quiet Center I could have
like put it a little lower but I think
it works I had to go get some of the
liners I needed so I'm gonna be putting
white on my lower lash line because this
is such a pink look you know these
colors just tend to make people look
sick so we want to like avoid that as
much as possible for this specific look
I'm in a tight line with a brown I'm
also gonna be putting on some mascara
this is the Kiko golden waves mascara
alright guys so here's the final look
with everything done
I feel like this look is simple but not
necessarily boring yeah I like it it
turned out just way different than I
thought it was going to be yeah so would
let's move on
to look number three hi guys we're gonna
start on look number three using the
element of surprise palette so I already
on my eyes primed and set I'm gonna
start off with using the peach shade
today I want to do kind of a cut crease
or I don't know basically I want to put
this all over the lid so we'll see how
that goes probably something kind of
neutral I feel like I have had a lot of
neutral looks on my channel lately but
I've just been enjoying the neutral life
for a little bit so I'm gonna be buffing
the peach shade on my lid and just
getting a nice transition for us next
I'm just going to continue building
color in the crease I'm gonna go in
though with this one here which is C
stars I want to keep this kind of
actually neutral and warm I don't like
this palette tends to go kind of berry
really fast like there's this color that
color even that so I just want to try to
keep it as warm as I can and more
neutral and I am focusing this on the
inner portion like the whole crease
front to back because I kind of want to
try to do
a cut crease situation I don't know
that's kind of what I'm thinking right
now we'll see and I got a mic so
hopefully you guys can't hear the
upstairs neighbors I know they're doing
like some type of birthday party because
they all sing happy birthday to each
other
so hopefully you guys can't hear that
and then just to continue deepening
things up I'm going to take this shade
here and this is a brown it's kind of a
purpley brown and it has gold shimmer in
it so I'm gonna try to tap off as much
as I can so hopefully a lot of that gold
shimmer does not translate on the eye
and I'm just bringing this lower on to
the eyelid and blending it into the
crease still just lower and I'm just
gonna go back and forth between all
three of those shades to get a nice
blend hopefully okay so I don't know if
I've ever technically cut the crease so
I'm gonna use some concealer and try it
which I'll today
okay maybe not the best concealer to use
use a really good concealer oh no there
we go I just didn't put enough on Wow
look at that look at me go and I'm just
gonna do the same thing to the other guy
I'm not sure if the shape is super
similar but we're gonna go with it for
now I'm just tapping out that concealer
on the edges we'll go back over that in
a second I also want to go back over the
edge with this darkest Brown and really
make sure this is nice and dark I'm
gonna be using a different brush this is
like a Sigma let's see crease shader e47
I'm gonna use that and I'm just blending
that darkest shade into this part of the
eye
I don't know alright so for this part is
kind of becoming a disaster we're gonna
we're gonna finish out strong see what
we can do we're gonna go back to adding
the concealer just to make sure that
lines nice and sharp still okay well I
went back and forth a couple different
times I don't think I would call that a
sharp line but we're just gonna keep
going I'm not gonna stay there too long
let's get the color on the lid I'm gonna
lay down some glitter glue so we get a
nice stick to the lid and as I'm laying
the let's see let me show you it the
this bronzy brown shade I'm going to
have my brush foiled so just wet your
brush
this color is really hard to like get to
go on to the lid so I'm gonna use my
finger oh my gosh it's like a million
times better with your finger uh so this
is a disaster and look how textured this
eye looks now that could partially be
because I have so much concealer on my
lids maybe but like what in the heck
y'all
it looks like my eyelids are like about
to crack open and then like maybe the
fire of hell is gonna come through them
that's not a good look
well we're not gonna scrap it this is
definitely gonna be one of the looks
because I ain't got time try another one
and also this is real life homies all
right so I added in the dark brown and I
don't know this look is turning crazy we
all know that already so I'm gonna wipe
away any fallout I'm just gonna blend
out the edges I don't even know really
how the blending is just not very good
and I feel like it's so dark on the
inner portion of my eye but let's just
finish it out shall we
I'm gonna go with the peach shade buff
that onto the bottom of the lash line
I'm going in with the sea stars and I'm
gonna deepen up the bottom lashline and
then I'm gonna go into the dark brown
shade you guessed it and we're going to
be just putting that on the outer
portion the only light shade in here is
this like duochrome pink so I'm gonna
use that on the inner corner
I also brought it down on the lower lash
line but I did not foil it because I
don't want it to be too stark against
the darker colors we have going on I'm
gonna go in and add some liner so I'm
gonna put black on my tight line a
little bit on my lower lash line I'm
gonna put some white in the waterline
and then I'm gonna put some mascara on
all right we are deep and smoky today I
feel like the mascara and liner really
helped make it come together a little
bit
alright I'm gonna zoom it out we'll see
what this thing looks like alright guys
so this is the final look for look
number three it's deep it's dark it was
a bit of a disaster but I think it
overall like I don't hate it for my
first like real cut crease that I've
ever tried with like concealer and stuff
I don't know I want to try it with
different color
I think having a lighter color on the
lid might have helped pop it but again
we're using the colors in the palette so
I hope you guys enjoyed though let's
move on to look number four the final
look with this palette alright guys we
are onto the final look finally this
video has been filmed over the course of
a long time like at least three weeks so
I can't remember a hundred percent of
all the looks that I did if I'm being
honest with you today we're gonna be
doing a halo eye with pink in the middle
and kind of these brown purple colors on
the inner and outer corner so I'm going
in with the peach shade first that's
kind of the main transition I obviously
have all my face makeup already done so
I want to be really extra cautious today
about not letting any fallout happens so
I will be putting some powder under my
eyes once we get going and that should
hopefully catch any fallout I just I
really wanted to see this eye look like
being created with my face already done
I'll probably talk about this in my
intro or my review at the end here but I
will say that I you know my last look
the third one I felt like wasn't looking
very good but later once it all came
together it really was pretty so many of
you guys liked it and we're commenting
on that look so yeah you know sometimes
in hindsight your look is better than
you originally thought and it can just
be frustrating like getting there I also
think trying something new was a little
bit you know just harder for me and I
just felt like it didn't look good but
overall I really like that and I want to
try some more cut creases type of things
on my channel because I think it looked
really good I'm really happy with how it
turned out and I think that I can only
get better at it the more I practice
alright so we have the orange lay down
I'm gonna go in now with just a
translucent setting powder and we're
gonna be putting this kind of heavily
underneath the eye I find that this does
tend to kind of dry out my under eye so
it's not always the best method oh my
gosh I look crazy I did put quite a bit
on but I'm using these colors and I know
there's glitter and all that I'd rather
have a dry under eye and then have
fallout in darkness and basically like
to me feel like I ruined my whole look
we're gonna start deepening up the inner
and outer corner I'm going in to see
stars
I feel like this palette is really
pretty but I think that a lot of these
looks are gonna be kind of similar we'll
see so I'm just packing this on the
inner and outer corner so we can get
that like center part of the lid where
we're gonna put the pink
I also brought one of my cream shadows
to potentially like tap on the top so
we'll see if we actually end up using it
it's color pop too so I figured we could
just incorporate it and I'm gonna put a
little bit of this in that top part of
the crease as well just to hopefully
help blend and now I'm gonna go in and
just kind of blend out the edges with
the orange you can be kind of sloppy
with this because I feel like you have
to do a lot of back and forth so just
you can build up slowly or kind of just
go in put that pigment down and then we
can always just blend out a little bit
later now that we have that color laid
down I'm gonna go in with this dark
brown this is basically the darkest
Brown in the palette and I'm going to be
putting this on the inner and outer
corner this is the part that really
makes the eye look pop I find is just
going darker in the inner and outer
corner you have to have that depth so
that the center can really pop this
shade does have some pink sparkle to it
I don't feel like it really stays on the
eye so I'm just treating it basically
like a matte and you really want to make
sure that inner corner is dark which I
know is kind of frightening at first but
again I find that that's what really
makes this look pop and again I'm just
going back and forth trying to get the
best blend I can between all three of
those shadows we've used at the moment I
feel pretty good about this we're still
gonna be blending but we can go in with
the pink I'm gonna be using an exploiter
glue next the next glitter glue and I'm
just gonna be tapping that on the very
center where we have no product I would
say the most difficult part of this I
look at least for me is to make sure
that I have that kind of spotlighted
Center even and not the pigmentation of
both is even as well that can be a bit
of a challenge for me
so yeah that's just just a little note
that I have
all right and we're just gonna go in
with the pink I'm gonna try a brush
first but I probably will just go in and
tap with my finger to this pink in this
palette is absolutely stunning I
freaking love it and so we're just going
to be making this the most pigmented in
that center portion of the eye
really building up that color and then
we will work on blending it out and
personally I don't like taking it too
far into the crease but I will be
blending again that area out as well so
for I'm really really enjoying this look
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna take a
little bit of the peach mixed with that
sea stars and we're just going to be
blending out this top portion I'm also
going to be taking a really small brush
and taking that darkest shade we used
and I'm really focusing that on the
inner and outer most corner where we're
gonna have the most depth and then I'm
gonna blend it out and kind of use
tapping motions to blend it into the
pink again especially hitting this inner
corner so we have that contrast I'm
gonna be taking a smaller fluffy brush
going in with seastars and again just
making sure we have a bit of a gradient
I feel like pretty naturally this pink
blended nicely so I'm just going in with
my finger and tapping out the edges and
it's interesting as I already brought to
that Brown it's like looking a little
purple looks really cool alright so
that's what I have after blending I'm
really happy so far with this look I
think it looks really really cool it's
fun it has a little bit of neutral so
now I'm going to swipe away the powder
there's a little bit of pink there's a
little bit of brown so oh we're having a
light under-eye today hopefully a little
bit of setting spray or like you know a
setting mist can kind of bring that area
back for underneath the I'm gonna go in
with the orange and I'm going to just
buff that along the entire part of the
eye you could do something that would
like mimic the top but I kind of want
the pink on the top to be like the only
pop of pink so I'm not gonna do that
next I'm gonna be taking the seastars
color that mid-tone Brown and we're
gonna be putting that on the whole lash
line as well but closest are in close
to the lashline not buffing it out and
bringing it down as far I decided I do
want a bit of that sparkle so I'm gonna
be taking the shade over again from
colour-pop it's one of the supernovae
shadows I'm gonna put a little bit on
the back of my hand and then I'm just
going to take my finger and just kind of
tap it to the center of the eyelid just
to add a tiny bit of sparkle this is
super optional you don't need this to
like finish the look by any means but I
just thought it would be kind of fun all
right so I just tap that into the
opacity I like I think it looks really
pretty I really like this I look to
finish off the eyes I'm gonna go in with
some liners I'm gonna put some black on
my tight line as well as a little bit on
my lower lash line and buff it out with
my finger I'm gonna put some white on my
waterline and then I'm going to be
putting the perversion mascara from
Urban Decay on and then we can come back
and finish up the lips okay so this is
the look so far I'm really into it I'm
gonna spray my face really fast
hopefully to bring back some of my
highlighter that I feel like got doled
out from all that powder and while
that's drying I'm gonna go in with the
lightest shade in the palette and just
put that on my inner corner for a little
bit of brightness alright so this is the
look with the lips I think it's really
pretty I'm really happy with how this
turned out I like that added bit of
glitter I think it just adds something
kind of fun and special so yeah let's
zoom out I'm gonna give you guys some
final thoughts on this palette and kind
of like wrap this video up alright so a
few thoughts on the palette now that
I've done in total for sure five looks
but I've also done just like using a
couple shades here and there with other
things I think this is a really nice
palette it's not something that I would
purchase and I'm glad I didn't purchase
it when it first came out because I feel
like I have similar colors in my
collection but I will say that this is
consistent to me with what I've
experienced quality wise from colour-pop
I feel like I heard maybe some bad
things about this pink but honestly
every time I've used it it's performed
so so nicely I really really enjoy that
pink it's it's not a matted but it's not
like super metallic it's kind of this
just nice opaque shimmer shade if this
is something that you wanted in your
collection and don't have similar shades
I think it's a nice option I know I had
talked about this
soyal shade when I had done the cut
crease as being very textured and it was
but I feel like overall the look as a
whole when I wasn't in that headspace
and looking at the footage I think it
turned out really pretty so you know I
kind of not take it back but it looked a
lot better than I had originally thought
so even that shade works out really nice
there's a couple of duo crumbs in here
but overall this is a very neutral
palette and again I feel like you can
definitely recreate the looks that I did
here with other palettes in your
collection if you are into these tones
you probably have similar things but for
getting it in my boxycharm I'm really
happy with it
and I do like some of the looks I
created I think my first look as well as
this look and the third look I really
liked this the second look was a very
simple look and kind of avant-garde with
that like heart so yeah but I just
wanted to show that like not every look
has to be this full-out glam thing like
on the everyday when I'm going to work
or I have a gig or whatever it is I like
to do something really simple and use
like maybe one or two shades kind of
just blend it out really softly in the
crease with a little extra emphasis on
the outer corner so overall I hope you
guys enjoyed the video and let me know
what your favorite look is in the
comments I'd love to know other than
that thank you guys so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
