so much for watching this is going to be
my second 4 looks 1 palette and this one
is all about the dose of colors ice
cream palette I did a whole swatch video
and review on this I'll leave that link
down below this was on a favorite and
I've talked about it a lot so I wanted
to show you guys different ways that
I've been using the palette it has the
neutrals but it also has some pops of
color it's just an overall really fun
palette that quality's really great I'm
not gonna stay too long on this so if
you want to see 4 different looks you
can create using this palette then just
keep watching
hi guys this is going to be the first
look using the Joseph colors ice cream
palette this is my palette for the day
so I have liked the light cream shade
this is the soft pink and then I have a
berry this nice dark color and then the
color cone I wanted to do kind of like a
berry swirl type of I look so yeah let's
get into it I love this palette so much
because it has this matte cream shade my
favorite I'm just gonna put that all
over my eyelid from the base of the
lashes to the brow bone this just sets
the primer I've already put down and
just helps things to blend out easier
now I'm gonna take cone is my first
transition I'm just gonna go lightly
with this because I want that berry
color to be like the more prominent
transition color okay now that that's
blended out I'm gonna take the color
berry swirl I'm gonna put that on
another blending brush but this one's
slightly smaller tap off any extra and
just go kind of a slightly below it just
kind of building up that crease shade a
little and once there's less product on
the brush you can kind of blend that
into the cone shape I'm gonna stop the
blending there for now I'm gonna go in
with the color pop shadow this is the
color lovely and I'm just laying this
down on the lid of my eye kind of as a
base the pink shade is pigmented but I
just wanted something for it to kind of
stick to I wanted to amp up the glitter
and I kind of just wanted to use a color
pop shadow so I'm incorporating it now
I'm gonna take a flat shader type of
brush and I'm gonna go in with the color
bubblegum and I'm gonna put that on my
lid top that off cuz there is quite a
bit of sparkle in the shade now I'm
gonna take another type of shadow brush
and I'm gonna go into the color double
scoop and that's gonna be the color I'm
gonna use to like deepen up the outer
portion of my eye I want this to be
darkest at the lash line and then kind
of blend it into that berry color now
I'm gonna go back in with the blending
brush we use the color berry swirl with
and I'm gonna blend out in this outer
portion with that color and then I'm
gonna take the color cone and just
barely barely barely so lightly just on
the outside edge kind of blend out the
berry now I'm gonna go in with my
finger and the color bubblegum and just
kind of pack that color back on the lid
I feel like we lost some intensity with
all the blending which is normal I use
my finger quite a bit to pack color on I
just feel like you can get the most
pigmentation just so fast just get it
done I feel like if you are not a fan of
like anything glittery you will not like
this bowl don't you and then like we've
been doing I'm gonna take the color
double scoop again and tap off a lot of
it and just to make sure we get a good
blend just kind of like bounce it over
the edges of where that bubblegum shade
is I also want to take the berry color
again just kind of keep this a little
more matte because there's a lot of
sparkles now I'm gonna take the color
berries and cream we're just gonna put
that right underneath the brow bone I'm
just gonna brush away any of the glitter
definitely some glitter fall out with
that and I wasn't expecting to do this
but because of that color pop shadow I'm
just gonna go in with a little bit of
banana split and just lightly put that
on the inner corner I don't want it to
be too crazy yellow but I think I'm
gonna go in and tightline with the urban
decay liner in Roche as well as put it
on my lower lash line and smudge it out
with my finger I am gonna also go on my
waterline with the NARS larger-than-life
eyeliner in groove Bonaparte it's just a
nude just to kind of brighten up the eye
and for my lower lash line I'm gonna
take a smudger brush and I'm gonna take
the color berry swirl I just I like this
color I'm just gonna smudge that on the
bottom lash line I'm also gonna take a
little bit of the comb color and just
kind of put that slightly underneath it
let's throw some mascara on these lashes
this is the Smashbox x-rated mascara
okay guys that is the finished look with
mascara I hope you enjoyed this kind of
like very eye with the pink bubblegum I
definitely would say that the pink shade
has quite a bit of Fallout I guess it is
kind of glittery I feel like little
sparkles in it do fall down on your face
if you're not super careful and they
kind of like blend up too so I like the
shade in the palette but I just wish you
didn't have quite as much sparkle anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this look and
let's
bad luck too
hi guys this is going to be look too
using the ice cream palette I want to
get my hands on this lavender shade
today so that's kind of gonna be the
focus let me swatch the colors so that's
gonna be that palette today I'm gonna be
using the lavender all over the lid this
to blend it out I'm gonna use the gold
in the inner corner the highlight shades
gonna go all over the lid and the brow
bone and then the last shade I'm gonna
use on the lower lash line I'm first
gonna take the matte shade berries and
cream and put that all over my eyelid
from my brow bone down to my eyelashes
so as a transition color today I'm gonna
be using the color cone I've really been
liking this I feel like you can kind of
blend this up as deep and dark as you
want or as like light as you want so
just with a light pressure I'm just
blending that into the crease and the
upper crease and just making it a nice
transition shade I've really been liking
this Brown too just like all over the
lid eyes my like one shadow all kind of
smokey eye it's such a pretty kind of
almost rosy brown color I really like it
now I'm gonna go in with a NYX jumbo eye
pencil and I'm gonna put this all over
the lid this is gonna be a base for the
lavender shade if you could tell by the
swatch there's a little bit to be
desired in the shade I'm not saying it's
bad I think it's hard to make matte like
almost pastel colors they're difficult
to make but it could be more creamy I'm
just gonna put this all over the lid and
blend it out with my finger before we go
in with that shadow now that I have that
patted out I'm gonna take the medium
angled shading brush by Sigma and I'm
gonna go in with lavender honey and I
like this brush because it's not too
dense I'm still gonna like be blending
as I apply it which is what I want and
I'm just packing this color on the lid
and then I'm gonna blend out later with
comb and then just for extra
pigmentation I'm gonna take my finger
and then just lay this on the lid and
just really make sure it closest to the
lash line you have the most pigmentation
I'm super surprised too for such a
bright color there's like hardly any
fallout which is amazing I'm gonna go
back in with the color cone and a
different blending brush it's slightly
smaller I'm just gonna be blending out
the
Edge's I kind of want this to be just a
simple two-tone look so kind of trying
to make the best transition between the
two colors that I can while keeping the
lavender honey shades still really
pigmented on the lid and I do want the
deepest part of my crease to be in the
outer corner and then a kind of lighter
in the inner corner I decided I'm gonna
take a little bit of the double scoop
color which I was only gonna put on the
lash line I'm actually gonna put it on
the outer corner to kind of blend things
too I think it'll look a little better
and give it a little more depth so I'm
gonna take that and just gently kind of
blend a little I just wanted a little
something more oh my gosh my eyes like
all red I did not even realize that
until right now that's so both my eyes
are like super red that's so weird
they don't hurt or anything rich I think
I'm s are just like I don't know not
giving them enough like sleeper I don't
know what that's about and just to
further the blending I'm gonna take the
brush that we use lavender honey on and
just kind of Pat it over the transition
part where they meet now that I have
that done I'm gonna go in with the gold
color banana split and put this on my
inner corner just lightly oh my gosh
this I is like freaking me out oh I hate
that for a liner today I'm gonna be
using the urban decay broach you guys
know and just try and finish this up so
it's like in every single look I'm gonna
tight line and put this on my lower lash
line and smudge it out with my fingers
because my eyes are looking a little
scary in red I'm gonna go in with a nude
liner to line my lower rim just to kind
of brighten it up a little bit for the
lower lash line I'm gonna go in with the
color double scoop and just a little bit
of it cuz it is darker I'm just gonna
rub that on the liner that I've laid
down and I'm gonna take a little bit of
Kona and just blend that out tiny bit
I'm gonna add a little bit more gold
shadow as well and put this on the inner
portion of the lower lash line I'm gonna
add some mascara this is the Smashbox
x-rated and I will be right back and
show you guys if I'm alive okay guys
this is the final look I did add a lip
product it is the tarte lipsurgence in
the color exposed I hope you guys
enjoyed and let's move on to look number
three
hi guys this is gonna be look three
today with the dose of colors palette
today I thought I would recreate a look
I did on Instagram
so I'm going to be focusing on the color
cone sherbert and blueberry swirl and
then I'm gonna use a mint chip as my
inner corner highlight if you want just
like my everyday look with this you can
stop when I use Cohen and sherbert just
stop there and that's what I mostly wear
out of this palette so that's what we're
working with
really nice berries and then that pop of
the mint I really like this color
combination I think it's fun a little
unexpected
amber F likes that mint in the inner
corner too so let's get started I've
already primed my eyes and I'm going to
set the primer with the berries and
cream color it's just a matte cream
color in the palette my eyebrows are
pretty dark today so don't line them all
so I'm doing like a first impression on
my makeup so if you know there's a lot
of texture I don't know
stuff's going weird that's why so let's
go into cone or taking the e-40 a
blending brush this is like my favorite
I really don't feel like I switch it up
too much and then we're just gonna be
blending that into the crease and the
upper crease and just kind of blowing it
out once you have a nice transition
worked out I'm gonna go into the color
sherbert and I'm just going in with my
finger that's my favorite way to apply
this shade if not going with like a
stiff synthetic brush just putting that
on the inner 2/3 or so super simple now
I'm gonna go in and I'm going to take
just like a I don't even know that I
like to stamp with this brush but just a
more dense brush and I'm gonna go in
with blueberry swirl and we're just
gonna put that on the outer corner of
the eye this is like the first look I
ever did with this palette and we're
just gonna put that on the outer
two-thirds of the eye and you can kind
of bring it into the crease a little and
make sure we haven't lost any of our
blending edges I'm going in with Cohn
and the blending brush again and just
kind of blending out that color now I'm
gonna go in and in my inner corner with
the mint color and I don't like to go
too heavy with this color it's super
pigmented so I love that it just like it
makes this eye so much fun I forgot to
bring all my eyeliners in
about here so I'm going to go tight line
with like a coppery brown color
underneath my upper lash line i'm also
gonna run a little bit on the lower lash
line and i will be right back just so
you guys know I actually decided to go
in with a different colored liner this
is Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil in
1999 it's kind of like a burgundy more
like pink toned purple I thought that'd
be fun so for the lower lash line I'm
going to go in with I can't remember
what I did for that post but I think I'm
gonna go on with berry swirl closest to
the lash line on top of that liner
because I think it will just compliment
it really well and I'm using that like
smudger brush that I do and then I do
want to blend that out so I'm gonna take
a little bit of cone and kind of just go
a little bit lower than that and then
I'm just gonna go back in with the mint
color and just make sure that color ends
we blend it in with the image I'm gonna
put some mascara on this is the x-rated
mascara from Smashbox okay guys that is
the final look I hope you enjoyed look
number three again if you want to just
like keep it more everyday I basically
just put that cone all over the crease
and then put sherbert on the lid and I'm
good to go for the day so this is kind
of like a Sun one and I will see you in
the next look
okay guys you're on to look for today
this is gonna be our color palette I
really wanted to focus on the gold shade
I don't think we've used that so far I'm
not gonna lie this part of the tutorial
is filmed way later than those three
other looks so hopefully with this one
it will use all the colors I haven't
looked back at that footage so the gold
shade here banana split is gonna be like
our main focus but first y'all know
we're gonna go into berries and cream
and we're gonna put that all over our
lid from the lash line to the brow bone
now I'm going in with a blending brush
and I'm gonna go in with cone first this
matte shade here but I'm gonna go very
lightly I really want to gradually build
up this crease because I really do want
the berry and the gold colors to be the
main focus of this but I do need
somewhat of a transition and I don't
want it to go to pink with that berry
I'm going to be doing a little bit of
that halo eye as well today so we'll see
how that goes now that I have that built
up as a transition I'm gonna go in with
very swirl and I'm taking just another
kind of fluffy blending brush this one
is a little bit more tapered though and
I'm just gonna start defining the crease
a little bit more and packing the color
on a little heavier by not going quite
as high and we do want to make sure
we're putting this on the outer and
inner corner to start building up the
base of that halo eye and once you have
less product on the brush you can kind
of bring the color up because it'll just
help blend and not deposit as much of
pigment I'm going into that same berry
color with a smaller brush and just
packing that on the inner portion of my
eye now to intensify the gold I am gonna
put down a cream base is this gonna help
it stick and again just intensify the
pigment I find that the banana split
shade is a little flaky so I think this
will just help it perform the best it
can and I'm just lightly blending that
out with a brush alright it's time to go
in with banana split I'm taking a flat
shader brush and I'm going to pack this
on a center portion of the lid and now
I'm gonna go back in with the berry
swirl and just deepen up and blend those
is where the gold touches it and I'm
gonna take a little bit of that berry in
a clean blending brush and I am gonna
bring it up a little higher because I
think this needs a little bit more depth
and I need to go in with a darker color
and I don't want to cover all the bay
area and now I'm going to go into the
color hot fudge and I'm gonna put that
in the most concentrated area so on the
very outer corner and the very inner
corner and then blend that into the very
and now once again we're gonna go in
with the berry and just try to blend the
brown and the berry together I do have a
bit of fallout so I'm just gonna try to
brush that away I'm kind of going in and
just taking the berry shade and blending
it into the gold I don't know I kind of
like the way that's looking I think that
suppose we're gonna get and I do kind of
like it so let's go in with some liners
on my tight line I'm gonna go in with
the bronze Bonanza color front pop and
I'm going to put a tiny bit of
perversion from urban decay and on the
bottom I'm going to be pretty Urban
Decay's 1999 on the lower lash line and
smudging it out so I'll be right back
I'm gonna finish up the lower lash line
so I'm gonna go into faerie swirl and
smudge that into the lower lash line and
then since I don't have a shimmery shade
I'm just gonna use the matte cream color
to brighten up the inner corner I'm
gonna add some mascara and I'm also
gonna put a nude color on the lower lash
line just to kind of pop my eyes a
little bit more and I'll be right back
okay guys here is the final look I hope
you enjoyed this one I think this is one
of my favorite ones actually I think it
looks really good it's a little more
dramatic for me but I do like it thank
