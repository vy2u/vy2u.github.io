Lauren this is the long overdue for
looks one pallet using the morphine and
kathleenlights palette it's taking me a
really long time to get this up so I
apologize but it just takes a long time
for me to do these videos I don't love
doing tutorials because I don't have a
great setup I feel like my lighting
could be better and all of these things
just doing one tutorial would be a lot
of work but doing four in one video it's
a lot of work for just one outcome
that's why it takes longer for me to get
these up but if you haven't seen what
the morphe and kathleenlights palette
looks like this is it it's really pretty
I do have a first impression and swatch
video I will leave that link down below
the more I've used this the more I do
like it but it's not a favorite it's not
like a stunner I think that it's really
good shadows for the price but I don't
think it's anything more than that I
don't think anyone needs to run out and
get it but I am happy that it's so
inexpensive because it's great quality
and you can get a lot of bang for your
buck it just I think color wise my
personality isn't quite this but I still
enjoy it so hopefully that makes sense I
don't regret this palette especially
again the price is just what you know
seals the deal for me of it being like
yeah it's great for $15 yeah it's
awesome
anyway let's just get into the tutorials
I have four different looks this is the
last look any look I have in my intro is
the last look I did because it's the day
I film my intro anyway hope you guys
enjoyed them although I will have all
the information listed down below if you
want to know what I used and if you have
any suggestions for the next four looks
one palette let me know I was thinking
about the pastel goth because it's going
to be my companion palette for my pan
that palette but if you have any other
suggestions just let me know down below
and I'll get started on that and it'll
be up in four months hopefully faster
than that but you know anyway let's get
into it
thanks so much guys
hi guys this is gonna be like number one
for the morphine catherine lights
palette I'm feeling like going kind of
neutral today so let me swatch the
colors I'm kind of thinking I kind of
want to go like cool with a warm crease
and just keeping it really neutral I
might bring in a pop of color oh wow how
creative right I just kind of want to go
basic today and see what that's like I
don't normally do that so I have already
primed my lid using the Maybelline
master precise eye primary and I'm gonna
go in with the light cream shades that's
Matt and just set my primer so that I
can blend out on top of my printer now
that I have that on my light I'm gonna
go into fy'y 40 brush I'm gonna take
this lighter shade for right now and
just kind of buff that into my
transition in crease and I'm going to go
a little sloppy with it
and I want to lightly build up color I'm
going to be doing a wing today because I
am doing a first impressions on some wet
and wild stuff so that is the reason I'm
going a little more classic if you guys
follow me I don't normally do a wing so
I just like to keep it more classic and
not so way down with shadow if I'm gonna
do a harsh wing now that I have this
officially built up in the crease I am
going to go in with this is a brush
actually from colour-pop but you could
go in with any kind of like fluffy brush
that's a little bit tapered kind of like
the Mac 217 I think that's what the cult
I called it like a 239 in a different
video but that's not in the sculpt I'm
gonna go in with that darker gray shade
and just really lightly I just want the
tiniest bit I don't want to get too dark
with this again cuz I'm gonna have that
liner but I do want to break it just a
little bit more definition and darkness
and this isn't all matte I actually what
I'm doing today except for my inner
corner and I want to keep the darkness
closest to the lash line and then blend
up from there so we can still have that
warmth ultimately blending into our brow
bone I'm gonna go back in with the
original 40 and just kind of blend out
the edges I'm not using any new product
though I'm gonna go back in with that
light creamy shade that we used
originally and just Pat that and really
pack it in the inner portion of the eye
just to brighten it up as much as
possible I wish this showed up a little
more on my skin just like a tiny bit
brighter and then just to blend that out
I'm gonna take what we use the grave
line on and just kind of have now I'm
gonna go in with this one while it's
getting tip eyeliner and just create a
wing and hopefully it turns out good so
that's my eyeliner done it does even as
it's gonna get I had a few issues so
let's move on to the lower lash line
actually let's move on to some liners
I'm gonna be using this brown pencil
under my tight line just to make sure
that there aren't any weird spaces I
especially I mean I do this all the time
but I especially like doing this when I
have a really thick liner cuz I don't
want to see skin in between for the
bottom lash line I'm actually gonna keep
it really light I'm just gonna go in
with my white liner from Stila and do
the waterline I just want to keep it
right for underneath the lashes
obviously I'm gonna go back into the
palette and I'm gonna take that original
Brown color we used and just smudge that
underneath and see where that gets us
with definition and I'm only taking it
about halfway that's all I'm gonna do
for my lower lash line I am gonna take
this little pencil brush and the
shimmery shade and highlight my inner
corner and then I'm just gonna go on
with some mascara this is the fully
charged by pure and I'm gonna put this
on my top and bottom lashes this is the
final look using the morphe palette I
think it turned out really well super
simple except for that crazy wing I will
see you guys with a look number two
let's start off look number two using
the morphine kathleenlights palette I
just got in the mail a bite Beauty
influenster voxbox that's what they're
called I really want to try out the
whiskey shade which is like this really
dark color and I just wanted to use that
green too so the lip and that green
color are what is inspiring this so let
me get some swatches of our color
palette and we'll start I'm so sorry if
you can hear that crow in the background
crows are creepy right I feel like crows
are kind of scary anyway so these are
all the colors that I want to use today
I'm basically going to use the warm
shades on the lid the light highlight
shade in the inner corner and then the
green shade on the lower lash line so
let's see how that works out
I've also pried my lids using my
Maybelline primer and I set it with a
powder already too so I don't need to do
that so first thing I'm gonna go in with
my e-40 brush and I'm gonna take the
shape that looks kind of like desert
sand from makeup geek I'm gonna put that
on my brush tap off and I'm just gonna
start going in my crease with this just
blending out no I was gonna not put this
all over the lid but I think I'm just
gonna put it all over the lid so now
take that color and just put it all over
your hole with it I'm gonna switch
brushes this is just the one from
colour-pop yeah I'm just gonna put it
all over the lid I like that and for
this I'm kind of like sweeping and
rolling my brush and they're not like
lifting it because I don't want to fall
out I'm moving back to the e-40 so that
I can just continue to blend out the
edges of this I'm going back in with
that same brush we used to put the color
all over the lid and I'm gonna take that
darker Brown this one here and I'm gonna
put that this on the outer corner and
keep it closest to the lash line
we'll use that more yellow toned Brown
and blend out after and I'm kind of
bringing it into the crease just a
little bit I like the way that's like
framing my eye I feel like that looks
pretty good so once again just blending
blending blending
I'm gonna go in with gosh I can't hold
this palette today I don't know that's
better
I'm gonna go in with this one here it's
just the light shimmery shade and I'm
gonna put that on the inner corner to
highlight my inner corner we might go in
and highlight again once we do the green
but let's just move on I'm gonna go in
and tightline and also put some of this
on my bottom lash line just the outer
third just so that the green has
something to stick to I don't want too
much pigment but I think that this would
be a nice base so I'm gonna do that
really fast and while we're doing liners
I'm gonna go in and line my waterline
waterline I'm gonna go in and line my
waterline with this Stila white liner
and oh my gosh do you see that help I
got it oh my gosh that was so crazy
did you yeah what the Freak okay be very
careful putting this in your waterline
really fast I'm gonna go in with the
light shade here and just a big fluffy
brush and just sweep it underneath I
don't know if I have any fallout but I
thought let's move on to the green and
then we'll almost be done which is
really awesome I'm gonna go in with this
short little smudgy type of brush I'm
going to try to pack this on actually
I'm switching it up again I never plan
is I just kind of like have a little bit
of an idea so anyway I'm going in with a
little bit of a fluffier kind of brush
like that and I'm gonna go in with that
yellow Brown muse on the top and just
kind of run a little bit of this under
my lash line I kind of just want a
little bit of something so the green can
look a little blended out I'm okay with
taking that kind of far down - I really
like the way the top of my eyelid looks
and once you have that done now we're
gonna go in with the grain and I'm going
to just ledge that as close to the lash
line as possible and I'm kind of
bringing that all the way in to like
here and again I'm kind of bringing it
down a little bit because we did blend
with that Brown so I feel like we can
plus once we put on our bottom mascara
it's gonna cover it a little bit
I want it to be as bright as I can make
it like I said we might do a I'm gonna
go back in and highlight my inner corner
and I'm gonna bring it to meet up with
that green and I take another brush and
take that same like warm brown yellow
color this palette it's still hard for
me to hold it was this on here
and I'm just kind of running it under
that great I'm gonna put some mascara on
I'm using the even minerals mascara this
is their volumizing it says ultimate
volume buildable care and I'm going to
coat my bottom and top lashes okay so we
are all done with the eyes and now let's
go on with lips I'm going to be again
using the bite Beauty this is the lip
liner in 0:44 it doesn't have like an
actual name I just got these in the mail
once again from Influenster so it's like
a normal wood pencil they remind me of
the Mac ones although I've never used a
Mac one you know from everything I've
seen it reminds me of a Mac one I'm
gonna line my lips I might just speed
this up or cut it out we'll see and then
I'll fill it in with the other one we'll
see what it looks like okay back to my
lips totally filled in with the lip
liner I hope that they look somewhat
even or clean you guys no lips are what
I struggle with the most so I do think
that it built up a little weird in some
areas like they're a little bit darker
but let's put the lipstick on top this
is the color whiskey okay guys this is
the finished look I hope you enjoyed I
think it's really fun it's a little more
vampy than my normal but I thought it
was something fun I was just like
thinking in bed like what look am I
gonna do tomorrow and this was what I
was kind of inspired to do I think it
turned out basically how I thought it
would so I hope you guys enjoyed it and
let's move on to look number three
let's move on to look number three I
obviously have quite an intense lift
going on today so I kind of want that to
be the star of the show for today's look
I'm going for
basically these four colors and maybe
one of those we'll see really just I
want to focus on this color on my lid
and then go from there there's a bit of
some swatches just so you guys kind of
know the palette we're working with I'm
gonna take this brush here and go into
the matte cream shade and just set my
eyelids I'm gonna go into this shade
here it's like a matte but it has like
glitter in it which sucks
I don't understand when these youtubers
collab and they are okay with the matte
with the glitter in it
like I know that's the shade we all hate
so what the Freak why is it in there
don't get me wrong I think this palette
is really nice but just so weird to me
I'm just doing a light bit of work in
the crease with this color I really just
want my blue eyes to really stand out
next I'm gonna go in with like a flat
shader brush and I'm going to take that
shimmer shade so this one here it's a
really nice like almost caramel e gold
or something I don't know I'm just going
to put that all over the lid and just to
make sure that that is as intense as
possible I'm gonna go on with my finger
and put that on the lid as well
I was potentially gonna like deepen up
the crease but I think I'm just gonna go
back in with that blending brush and
kind of blend out the edges
I'm analysis if it into the cream shade
to blend out some of the edges
I just wanted to overtake the lip so
next I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna take
this light shimmery shade and put that
in my inner corner I mean that's kind of
all I'm gonna do for the eyes I think
it's really nice so I'm gonna go in and
tightline using my pop the bronze
Bonanza liner and I'm gonna also use
this white liner in my waterline and
I'll be back I did end up bringing a
little bit of that liner down on my
lower lash line but now I'm gonna go
and I'm going to take the color we blend
it into the crease so the warm brown
here and I'm just going to just buff
that on the lower lash line just on the
outer outer portion like when I say
outer portion I actually mean it this
time I really want to keep the eyes
really bright and open I'm gonna go
ahead and put some mascara on this is
the pure fully charged mascara and I've
really been liking this it's giving me a
lot of great volume but still some like
length and separation I've really been
liking it so I'm gonna put this on and
I'll be right back guys okay guys this
is the final look I really like a simple
eye look I know I do a lot of fun colors
but I'm either doing that or like I'm
down with two shadows like I don't need
a ton of stuff and I really like the
look of simplicity like it's a stylistic
choice but anyway this is it I hope you
guys enjoyed it and let's move on to
look number four
hi guys let's do look number four this
is kind of far removed from all of their
looks so I'm so excited to film this
last one as you all know we are going in
with the kathleenlights and Wharf e
palette today I'm going to be recreating
a look that I wore in a past video so if
you were wanting that this is the look
for color palette today we're kind of
going with what we have been doing but I
really want to focus in on this kind of
burgundy color so that's kind of the
main focus but we will need some
transitions and I also need that inner
corner highlight so that's probably I
mean mostly what we're gonna be working
with today and then I am gonna be
bringing in this Josie Maran eyeshadow
so when we get to that I'll talk about
that first up I'm gonna go in and just
kind of run this over my entire eye it's
just the matte cream color I already
have one down but I just want to make
sure everything is blended out and ready
to go now that we have that done I'm
gonna go in with my efore tee and I'm
gonna go in with this shade up here and
I'm gonna be using that as my transition
really really lightly and I'm just
putting that in the upper portion of my
crease I mean I feel like most of my
looks are very similar I place eyes
shadow very similarly it's how I like to
do my eye shadow and we're just looking
for a nice soft transition and I'm
focusing more of the color on the outer
portion of the eye like I normally do
and then once you blend out more you can
bring the brush with less product into
the inner corner alright that's looking
pretty good to me I'm gonna go in with
the lighter of the two berry sheets and
I'm gonna kind of work this also into
the crease a little bit lower than that
last color and not too much it's just
kind of building up a bit of a base
since we are gonna go in with that other
deeper shade now that we have that done
I'm gonna close this up for a second
we're gonna go in with you Josie Maran
eyeshadow this is that liquid coconut
one and this is in Playa del pink I'm
just gonna give it a good shake so that
way we can get a nice even coverage and
I just go straight on with the doe foot
on to my eyes and we're just putting
this on the inner like two-thirds and
then I tap this out with my finger okay
I got some of the pink from my finger on
to it so hopefully we can get that to
brighten up a little bit I'm just gonna
like that actually okay I'm going in
with just a couple more layers patting
out building up to the intensity
I can't believe I put my pink finger
that I did just watch this into the
color because kind of deepened it up but
I think it'll still I think it still
looks even and okay we're gonna let that
dry for a second and then we'll move on
to the next step
all right let's move on we're going back
into the palette I'm gonna take the
deepest darkest burgundy shade this one
right here and we're going to be kind of
patting that on the outer two-thirds or
so take as clean of a brush as you might
have all my brushes are dirty almost all
the time I'm taking just this one here
it's like there I'll use my face as a
background just kind of like a I don't
know kind of blending tapered blending
brush I guess so we're just going to Pat
this on the outer corner and build that
up to some with some intensity and blend
out definitely tap your brush off and
kind of you can work up the color
I might actually switch my brush I don't
really like this one I'm switching to a
very similar one from colour-pop
it's just not as scratching I feel like
it's gonna blend a little better then
bringing it up a little bit into the
crease from out there just to kind of
give it a nicer cohesion I'm gonna go
back in with my fluffy original blending
brush and ii like the lighter of the two
berries and just use this to blend out
the outer portion i think that's the
best were gonna do i kind of feel like
this color patched up a little bit i
don't know if it's because of the
eyeshadow or what but it's definitely
like deeper and darker in the outer
portion so hopefully it looks blended
enough i'm not sure how I feel about it
I'm gonna move on and put this lighter
shade on my inner tear-duct
I'm just gonna take a flat brush and
just put a little bit of that on top of
that Josie Maran color just so it's a
little bit brighter just have the best
blend I'm gonna go in with the brush we
use to blend out that outer corner and
just kind of tap it on top of the seam
that's everything for the top of the lid
I'm gonna go in with my liners now so
the first one here is the pop Beauty
bronze bonanza and then this is the
white steel one so this will go on my
tight line and this will go on my bottom
waterline let's finish off the bottom
lash line I'm gonna go
with the darkest color I'm so awkward
always always when I hold pallets or do
anything and I'm not gonna take
something a little bit fluffier than
normal because I still want to diffuse
what I do want some of that depth so I'm
just gonna start putting on the lower
lash line and I think that's all I'm
gonna do I don't think I'm gonna add any
of the other colors I really wanted that
Burgundy to be the main focus and I'm
only bringing it 2/3 of the way in I'm
gonna go in with mascara and we'll see
the final look okay guys I'm back with
the final look I really like this I
think it's really pretty
this would have been a great Valentine's
Day look or something like that but I I
like this type of look all the time so I
don't feel like it it has to be just for
Valentine's Day that is everything for
this for looks one palette thank you so
much for watching please let me know
down below if you guys have any
suggestions for the next palette and
also let me know what your favorite look
was other than that I hope you guys
enjoyed thanks so much for watching I
hope you're having a wonderful day and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
