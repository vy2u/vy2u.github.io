Lauren thank you so much for watching
today's video is going to be a four look
series all focused on using this
eyeshadow from Kat Von D this is the
metal crush eyeshadow in electric
warrior I've been wanting this color for
a while like out of everything from her
line this is the color that kind of
spoke to me so when it went on sale and
I ordered it I was really inspired once
I got it in the mail and yeah I thought
I would create some looks around this
color every look is different there are
two more colorful looks and two more
neutral looks at least to me this is the
final look if you wanted all these time
stamps down below but you have been
seeing these on my channel for the past
week or so because I have been filming
all those tutorials but I hope you guys
enjoy I hope you guys enjoyed this type
of video because I do want to do them
more often but other than that let's
just get into look number one hi guys so
I have my base on right now I'm going to
just get into the eye look as you guys
know it was super inspired by greens so
I'm gonna be going in first with this
color here from Coastal Scents it's the
color Python I believe and we're just
going to be building up a nice
transition of this green that cap on D
shadow just like so inspired me so I'm
doing quite a green look like this is
probably the greenest of the green out
of everything we're gonna do the other
looks are gonna be more just like pop of
color but uh for this one we're going
pretty intense
and then I really want to punch the
color up here and into the brow like I
normally do so I mean I'm still blind
kind of soft but I do want this to be
you know having that green featured
quite prominently there all right I'm
like already in love like I should stop
here but I won't
let's go in and kind of deepen up an
outer corner I'm gonna be going into the
Kat Von D movie they look a remix
palette and we're gonna be taking just
like a grass green like a classic
actually we're gonna start with this one
and then move into this one but just
something a little bit deeper and we're
gonna be building up some of the depth
in this outer corner
that was with that lighter green and now
I'm gonna go in with the darker green
I'm bringing it slightly into the crease
and again just focusing it on that outer
part of the eye I do want to keep the
outer edge like having that lime green
so I'm gonna go back in with Python and
just reflect out that edge for whatever
reason I feel like this one looks are
dingy and this one's like more bright
don't know why that happened I think
it's time for the star of the show this
is the Kat Von D metal crush eyeshadow
an electric warrior and this one on sale
from Sephora for I think it was only
thirteen and I just had to get it so I'm
gonna be putting this all over my lid
and I just like to use my fingers I know
not everyone does but I just love the
pigmentation I can get and how fast it
is with my finger I really do like where
this is at already I just hate that this
is darker and this one's not I don't
know if there was something maybe on my
brush I don't know what happened so I'm
gonna try to give this a little bit more
depth so we can match there's still a
little bit of difference in depth but I
don't know how to fix it so we're just
gonna keep going forward I I love the
way this looks so far for my inner
corner I'm gonna be going into the Naked
cosmetics holographic a highlighter
palette and we're gonna be taking the
green in here I am gonna wet my brush I
find that a wet brush works best to get
the most pigmentation from this and I do
want to kind of more metallic than not
so I'm just going to be putting this on
the inner corner oh it's a lot more
minty than it is lime green that's okay
and just to kind of blend this out I'm
taking my original Python brush and just
blending for the lower lash line I'm
going to be going back in with Python
and just running this all under the eye
and then I'm also going into the kat von
d palette and I'm going to be taking
that misfit which is the darkest green
we used and just running that on the
outer portion of the eye
for a liner today I'm just gonna be
running some of the vintage cosmetics on
my tight line I'm also gonna put a
little bit on the lower lash line and
smudge it out and then I'm gonna be
putting on my benefit roller lash
mascara and then I will be back I'll
have a lip on and I'll show you guys the
final look alright so we have the final
look on I have a bright lip with a
bright eye which I know a lot of people
tell you not to do but I don't care I
think these look really fun in summary I
think it's kind of like watermelon and I
love it so I love the way this eye look
turned out I think it's just a fun way
to wear green it's like a full-on green
hi Georgia Harris also did a full on
green hi earlier so I'll link that chat
chat get ready with me and down below if
you guys want to see how she did that
but um I just love it I love the green
and I love that I didn't use any neutral
colors like everything on my eyes is
green so this is definitely gonna be the
most intense look with that green though
I want to show some ways that you can
wear the green without it being like a
full-on green look so let's move on to
look number two alright hi guys let's do
look number two today we're gonna go
with something a little bit more I guess
simple and I'm gonna put the pop of
green on the lower lash line so first
off we are gonna be going in with the
Smashbox palette this is the ablaze
palette you guys have seen me again uses
a lot I'm going in and I'm gonna be
putting this sheet down as my transition
this is a pretty light transition on my
skin tone so I will be mixing the colors
I've been finding that's the best way
for me to get the most use out of this
palette
and now that I have that transition down
I'm going to be taking this color mixed
with this color and then just blending
that out and kind of continuing to
deepen up the eye I'm going to be doing
an eye where its darkest at my lid and
then it kind of just gets lighter as it
goes I hump and I find that although
we'll be working with those darker
colors it's best to start light and you
can always build up and I'm gonna buff
this color also just all the way on the
lid as well and I am getting a bit of
fallout so just be careful with whatever
you use I've decided to move on to a
denser brush and I'm gonna be just going
in with this shade and I'm gonna be
packing that on to the lid and blending
it in to where we've already put down
color and I'm just going to blend out
again with that mix of this color and
the lighter shade as well as just the
lighter shade and just kind of making
sure we have a nice gradient going on
and then for the final color on the lid
I'm gonna go in with the deepest shade
in the palette and this we're gonna pack
closest down to the bottom of the lash
line and we're not gonna take this up as
far as we did that orange red Brown cut
like this is one of those looks that
looks pretty messy when you start so
don't be scared just keep going
and now that I have that color laid down
I'm going to just go in and try to get
the best gradient that I can between all
the colors that we've already used
and once you feel like you have a decent
blend between those colors I like to go
back in with just my finger on the lid
closest to the lash line and just really
punch in the depth of that darkest color
you use so I had a lot more fallout than
I thought I was gonna have so I'm gonna
go clean that up really fast and then
I'll be back so we can do the lower lash
line all right so I clean up my eyes
just a little bit it wasn't too much I
also tried to make them a little bit
more even with blending I'm gonna go in
the in tight line with this vintage
pencil we got this in art boxycharm or
at least I did I didn't realize that
everyone got different stuff and then
I'm also gonna put some white on my
bottom lash line and waterline we're
gonna be really smudging out the green
so I'm gonna put a little bit of this
down as a base so we can hopefully have
just a brighter color down there I
wanted to say to that I think it's
really important with the look like this
to line your top lash line with a black
or something really dark just to
continue to drive home that like you
know it's darkest at the lash line let's
go in with the star of the show I'm
going in with a like angled fluffy
angled brush and I'm just going to be
putting this down first just to get an
idea of what its gonna look like and
then we're just gonna basically be
building this up a ton
and then just to see what it's like I do
want to like take a pencil brush and put
some of the green on this and see if I
can really get some more like opacity
and maybe even build up that metallic I
will say this was like not as metallic
as I thought it was gonna be compared to
like what I've heard about her metallic
crush shadows and also what I have in my
metal mat I really like the way that
looks so far so I'm gonna go in to this
highlighter from Kiko this is the free
Sol highlighter I'm gonna take the
lightest shade and I'm gonna put that on
my inner corner cuz it is the highlight
I'm wearing today so I thought it'd be a
nice match and I'm just gonna put I
don't know I kind of want to like foil
this but I really want to keep it a
little bit more subtle I guess so I'm
I'm not gonna file it for lips today I'm
going in with the peach because I am
wearing like a peach on my cheeks as
well I'm just putting this over the lip
balm I already had on and then last year
I'm gonna put on some mascara and then
I'll zoom out and show you guys if I
don't like alright guys so here's the
final look I hope you enjoyed the look
number two that I did using the green
shadow I did have a little bit of
fallout but I brushed it away I do
really like this look I think it's fun
it's a little bit intense on the top and
you know okay colorful on the bottom but
overall I really like it and I'm excited
to show you the other two looks that I
want to do with this I think they're
gonna be a little bit more wearable
still I mean this is still pretty
wearable I guess it's just a little bit
dark but you can do what you want to on
the top like depending on how deep you
want to get so alright I need to keep
this short I will see you guys in list
number three alright hello guys we're
zoomed in really close around look
number three using the green Kat Von D
shadow I did a look the other day using
these purples and I use like a peach and
stuff but I thought that the green would
look really pretty so today we're gonna
be doing like a purple smokey eye and
then
have the green as the inner corner so
that's kind of where I'm going with
today I'm gonna start off and I'm going
into this shade here from colour-pop
it's called dream boat and we're gonna
be laying down a transition
and then just add something interesting
I thought I would work in pumpkin spice
life from luck see I'm gonna keep this
in the front part of the brow but you
could use chickadee from makeup geek you
could use paper tiger from colour-pop
you could use cantaloupe slice from
Coastal Scents really a ton of different
colors but I just want to blend this
into the front portion and into that
kind of purply Brown we laid down
already
I'm switching to another blending brush
and I'm going back in with dreamville
and we're just going to build up some of
that crease color and not blend it quite
as high and then just to prepare my lid
for the darker colors I'm also going to
bring this shade onto the lid as well
I'm gonna take a fluffy shader brush and
I'm gonna go in with the Coastal Scents
color in it cinnabar rose and I'm going
to be placing this all over the entire
lid this one is the lighter of the two
it has a little bit more of a warm
undertone in that pink so I'm laying
this down first and it'll kind of be our
secondary transition shade into that
color pop 1:43 color
and then I'm gonna blend out with that
dreamboat color again and then closest
to the lashline I'm going to go in with
one four three and I'm just going to be
putting that on with my finger and
pressing it into the lid
and even using my finger there is a ton
of fallout so I'm just praying and
sweeping away and now I'm going to just
be working between these three colors to
get a nice seamless blend
and then I am gonna punch in that
pumpkin spice color again just kind of
revamp it make sure it's still nice and
bright and fun because this will be the
color we're gonna be using on the lower
lash line so for the lower lash line I'm
going to start working on adding that
yellow and this is going to go the
entire length of the lower lash line
just nice and buffed
and then I am gonna bring a bit of the
pink and the purple mixed on to the
lower lash line on the outer portion of
the eye those are so pigmented holy crap
and I'm just keeping that on the outer
half and I'm gonna bring back in that
yellow just to blend those colors out
with okay so that's the eye look so far
without any liner we're gonna add the
last touch of eyeshadow which is the
green one from Kat Von D I am going to
be wetting my brush and we're gonna be
putting this on the inner corner and the
lower lash line
and I do want this quite stark I think
this is looking so pretty I'm super
happy with how this look turned out so
far so yeah don't be afraid to really
punch that color in I'm gonna take a
little bit of this highlighter from Kiko
I'm gonna take the center shade I'm
gonna put out my fingers I'm just gonna
be tapping that on the center of the eye
just a little to bring a little bit of
dimension I'm also gonna chop a little
bit of the lighter shade next I'm gonna
go off camera I'm gonna put white in my
waterline I'm gonna put this Urban Decay
stash glide on eye pencil on my tight
line and then for mascara I'm putting on
the benefit roller lash and I will be
right back and we'll put on lips and
highlighter okay so this is the finished
eye look I think it's super pretty I'm
really into it I didn't know how the
yellow is kind of kind of playing but I
really like the way it's looking for my
lighter today I'm going in with the Dior
nude skin 0 - I think it's called pink
nude illuminator it's super pretty and I
think it'll be a nice kind of mix up
from all of the warmer colors on the eye
because it's kind of frosty but not too
pink and for lips today I'm going in
with a new color this is Amsterdam from
buxom this is one of my favorite lines
and recently Sephora had these on their
like weekly deals so I picked up two
different colors I picked up a red one
and I picked up this other nude and it's
like a peachy color I've been really
into the peaches
alright guys so that is the finished
look I hope you enjoyed this one I think
it's really fun the next look I do is
going to be a little bit more neutral so
I think I have like two neutrals and two
kind of crazy ones but I really like
this I think it's super fun I hope I'm
not too washed out I don't know it's
looking kind of weird on my monitor but
hopefully when I have to sit back it'll
be okay but let's move on to look at
number four the final look all right hi
guys we're on to look number four today
we're gonna be going pretty natural with
a pop of green I'm gonna be using the
Too Faced natural love palette today for
the base of this look and the first
thing I'm gonna go into is this color
here this is the shade nudie and that's
going to be my transition this is a bit
more of a cool tone to look I would say
neutral - cool tone this is the first
look I actually ever did with this
eyeshadow when I got it in the mail I
did this look at that same night and
then we went out to the movies so I
thought it was really pretty and like a
fun way to incorporate the green while
still you know being fairly neutral and
still feeling really pretty and not too
crazy now that I have the transition
going I'm going to be mixing between
kind of like all three of these colors
I'll probably start with this one but
the more cool colors out of the palette
and we're just gonna be building up that
outer corner just so we'll have some
definition because that green is gonna
go all over the lid
and I'm going back in with the original
transition and just blending everything
out and I like to just make sure that
there is a transition in this inner
portion not necessarily in the brow just
color there for the lid I'm taking Kat
Von D's electric warrior you guys know
the star of the show we're going to be
putting this all over the lid and into
the brown we laid down I am going to be
adding fix+ because that's what this
looks like
just from the brush look at this well
the second time worked a lot better but
I definitely find that you can get a
more metallic and opaque finish with the
with a setting spray at least a lot
faster
and then just to solidify that I'm going
to go over with my finger as well it's
looking super good so we are going to go
in and try to blend out that outside
edge where these two meets so I'm taking
a little bit of the green and I'm
blending with the brush we used before
I'm just softening that edge and I'm
gonna Pat with my finger a little bit
too
- hopefully soften it now that I have
that green laid down I'm just gonna go
back in with the darker shades from the
palate and just make sure we have some
nice stuff going on in the outer corner
and I'm just gonna blend out any edges
um I don't know why but it just like so
patchy over here it's like nothing will
stick to that part of my humble I do not
know why I don't know why this I just
look so much better I think this is
always my good eye this eye is a little
patchy but I can't blend anymore it's
also just like getting irritated so I'm
just going to have to leave it I think
I'm gonna take this flat end of the
brush and I'm just going to carry these
colors underneath the eye but not too
dark
I forgot to put on a lip balm I'm gonna
be using the patch ology lip service
today I'm going to be going in with a
bright color and I want some hydration
so I'm gonna put this on and let it kind
of sink in while we finish up the eyes I
was supposed to do this at the beginning
I've been trying to get better at doing
that for my looks but obviously I said I
just like so much fallout - it's so
irritating anyway I'm going in with
liners I'm going in with a white on the
waterline and I'm going to be going in
with a black on the tight line and a
little on the lower lash line I try
fixing some of the fallout by taking my
brush in this lighter shade and I just
kind of like ran it underneath the wing
and I'm trying to blend it out the best
I can but I just wanted some brightness
down under there so yeah I did that for
the inner corner I'm going in with the
Naked cosmetics highlighting palette
this is the holographic one we got in
the boxycharm I'm taking the yellow
shake here and I'm gonna put on my
pencil brush with the setting spray and
we're gonna be putting that on the inner
corner and I'm gonna run it down the
lower lash line that's kind of like my
normal thing if you haven't noticed this
is like a really pretty golden yellow
and I really liked the way it looked the
last time I did it
next I'm putting on some mascara this is
the benefit roller lash and then I will
come back and we'll finish up the lips
okay so this is the eye look it's kind
of patchy but I don't know it turned out
so much better the first time I did it
but it's still pretty it's just not very
well executed I'm taking off my lip balm
now that my lips are nice and hydrated
I've been doing so many more just bright
colors lately and today we're coming in
hat we're using this pencil from bite
Beauty this is the shade Zinfandel and
Zinfandel that's how you say it it's so
hard for me to say some things I'm
realizing like I do not pronounce things
well or I don't enunciate I I can't
stand them that's me um so anyway I'm
gonna put this on my lips and I'll be
back to show you the final look it's
gonna be really fun and hot and I like
it be back
I think my lip line might be a little
wonky still but I like it I think it's
such a pretty color I got visit Sephora
it was on sale for $10 so I was like I'm
gonna try it out and I love this color
it's so fun I really want to try some
like bright colors so that I can bring
them to Italy with me and just have
something that's easy to put on but
something I don't like and make a
picture look really good or whatever cuz
like I'm all about taking a bunch of
pictures a lot of their anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed the final look I hope
you enjoyed this like for looks series
I'm gonna be trying to do these more
often on my channel I really want to do
one with the legal palette still I'm
gonna do one with the ablaze palette
from Smashbox so look forward to that I
just got this green eyeshadow in and I
just I wanted to use it I was like I
bought this on sale for $13 and you know
what I'm gonna make sure I frickin get
some use out of it so I've used this I
want to say like six or seven times now
and I love it I think it's really nice
um
it's already been worth the purchase so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed thank you
