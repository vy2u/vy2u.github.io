Lauren if you can't tell I am sick I
feel like I just got sick back in
Christmas which I know is about like
three months ago but it's very
frustrating I do have a few videos that
I want to film though today I'm really
just hoping that I can get these filmed
and get better and then my next set of
videos won't be like this but there's
also the chance that I'll just get more
sick so I thought I feel okay today
let's film I'll stop rambling though
this is going to be my finale for for my
Fool's Day which was a project pan
started by Veronica shares it was a
collab with a bunch of other ladies
they're all gonna be linked down below
so definitely check them out I'm a
little bit late but I wanted to make
sure I use my products all the way
through it was only four products and
this project was more fun so it's like
fun items to use but I really wanted to
get the most use out of my stuff so I'm
just gonna start off with like the most
exciting thing one of the products that
I picked was my electric palette by
urban decay and I wanted to hit pan on
the pink shade here savage and I did I
don't know if you guys can see that
glittering pan oh there it is this is my
absolute oh it's all over my hands
this is my absolute favorite hot pink
shade it's so beautiful I love it I
usually use this to like blend into my
brows I would buy this whole palette
just for that color I love it so much so
I'm really happy that I was able to hit
pan and actually hit my goal for this
item but I barely did that I believe I
hit pan on this on the first and I'm
just really happy to see actual progress
and pan in such a colorful crazy palette
next I have the UH Nastasia moonchild
palette and I just wanted to get more
use out of this palette than I was
getting and I definitely have I've been
using a blue eyes and pink heart quite
often I'm really glad that I put this in
this project because I used this a ton
when I first got it but I kind of put it
away and this just made me love it again
surprisingly I've really been liking
blue ice and it's just like a duochrome
but it pulls blue I'm wearing it on my
cheekbones today on my nose
highlight and stuff and I just think
it's so pretty I find that I am really
drawn to like warmer like eyeshadows and
stuff but then for highlights I really
do like a cool tone I've really been
enjoying this I definitely feel like I
got a lot of use out of this I can see
some you know good progress in the pan
I'll take pictures and show you guys I'm
really happy with this and on to the
last two items these were a bit of a
fail if I'm being honest but I
definitely did use them more than I
would have since they were in this
project but by no means are they like
half used up or you know they don't have
any significant like progress on them
the first one here is the Josie Maran
coconut water color eyeshadow this is in
the color Playa del pink this is a
beautiful shade I definitely used it
again like I said a bit more than I
would have had it just been sitting in
my drawer it's just so metallic and so
beautiful I just don't go for this like
these are the types of looks I like to
do I've really been into oranges and
yellows and pinks and even like a green
duochrome lately so I I kind of just I
don't know this year I'm just kind of
going with what I want to do I'm panning
my Z palette but I also want to give
myself the freedom to be creative so
when I'm really wanting to do a specific
look and it doesn't involve something
let's in a project pan I'm giving myself
the leeway because I'd rather enjoy my
makeup and how my eyes are looking and
just being inspired in general then
force myself to use stuff and then just
not have that creativity flowing so
anyway I'm happy I got through what I
did of this but there's no like
significant progress and I will be
declaring this at the end of the year
just because it's getting old but I
really do like these besides the
packaging issue and the last item this
is the NYX jumbo eye pencil in oyster
and I really like this I just got a
bunch of new eyes shadows from Luxy
Beauty so I was using this as a base for
some of the looks I was doing and I
really do like it for that I think this
is such a pretty pencil it's affordable
it's drugstore and I really do like it
I used this probably three or four times
so not that much I never even sharpened
it sadly but I
I'm really glad that I was using this
this is probably something I should get
rid of too soon but I would repurchase
this I do like it that much so that's
everything guys kind of like more of a
review of the last two items since there
wasn't a lot of progress to show but I'm
really happy with this project
thanks so much to Veronica for inviting
me to join it was really fun just to
pick some more like vibrant things to
pan and and just be creative with this
project pan so that's everything I'm
going to end this here
hopefully I can edit this down and I
will see you guys in my next video
thanks so much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
