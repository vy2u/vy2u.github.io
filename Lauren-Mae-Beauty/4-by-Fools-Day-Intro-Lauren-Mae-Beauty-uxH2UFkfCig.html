Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be another intro into a
project pan I have three other project
pans going on at the moment I believe
what one is about to wrap at the end of
every wearing so I figured I had some
wiggle room to start a new one this was
started by Veronica shares I am in a
project with her currently for the
entire year it's our textures used 17 up
by 2017 I'll leave a video links down
below but anyway she was contacting me
and saying she wanted to do something
new coming up and I was totally game so
this is the finished for by full day if
you want to join in it definitely do we
are also having a couple of the ladies
join in so I will reach them off we have
Claire from crimson feather Lorraine
from LNS makeup Diane from some call me
Coco Helen from little helps be and we
also have pay me from gini-ji I'm more
excited to be doing this really fun
project with these lovely ladies they
will all be linked down below so
definitely go check them out as you're
into private Manning I know almost all
of them and they all do a lot of
practice and stuff so let's get into it
this was really fun because all the
categories are just more carefree
definitely have more like a april fools
type of theme which is exciting to the
first ruled pick for item one was
something has a vibrant or colorful you
guys know i like color so i decided to
go with this annex jumbo eye pencil this
is the color easter this is a color i
have had for a while but i just i love
it it's so pretty now isn't it vibrant
maybe not super vibrant but i really
want to use this as a base under my
shadow you'll see the other things that
I picked out I feel like it'll just go
well with everything and I'm really
excited to use this i love these
iridescent purple type colors you guys
know that and I want to try to use up
about half of this will see again the
ending date is on the first of April so
we have about a month and a half so
let's see what we can do with this the
next item is something that's sparkly or
glittery and I kind of cheated this I do
love letter i'm wearing glitter today
but the options that i wanted to pick
with her my glitter liners just
going to work there too old android l
and be like brush on them is so like
afraid that I really can't use them they
have to go in trash sadly so I decided
to go with something else that I wanted
to get some use out of this is the josie
maran coconut water eyeshadow and I have
the color playa del pink this isn't
necessarily glittery or sparkly but this
is really metallic and I'm going to come
in i'm going to count it so that's is
there such a beautiful color I feel like
it'll go well with other looks it's
pretty neutral and I really honestly
just want to get more new services
because as you guys know in my packaging
pet peeves tags that are dead I'll leave
that one down below to these little doe
foot applicator that come on here break
off into the product and the super
frustrating it happened to my rose gold
one and I don't want that to happen to
this without me getting more use out of
it i just want to use this more
hopefully at least two to three times a
week I go to Hama and measure it because
I honestly don't feel like you would
just use it down but maybe I'll mark it
and we'll see if I make any progress but
this is just something I want to get
more use out of and use that before it
just becomes obsolete the third item is
something in fun packaging and I chose
my Anasazi emunah child palette this
isn't like holographic packaging and I
just think it works well with this
project there are some like more
glittery highlights in here as well I
just really like this palette I think
it's really fun I like the option so I
want to get more games out of bed I have
a disk going in pink heart and I'd like
to continue using that one that would
have like a pink chef to it but i really
like blue ice as well I also thought I
can layer these on top of that NYX jumbo
eye pencil and get some pretty looks out
of it that way I know it's hard because
I don't have like a definitive goal but
I will take some photos of this and
hopefully we can see some progress when
it comes to these powders like being
more used by the end of the project well
see how this goes but I'm really excited
to be forcing myself to use this and the
last item number four is something that
makes you happy something that makes you
smile and I have to pick my electric
palette this palette is so beautiful i
love it so so much you guys have seniors
I know it's discontinued now are being
discontinued I do want to hit pan and
this pink shade savage I use this all
the time it's not what's on my eyes now
it's what I use to kind of do that
in my upper brow area I really just want
to hit panama's I definitely think it's
possible that's something I do with my
eyes probably like two or three times a
week so I definitely think I could do
that and I just love this palette it
brings a smile to my face it's so fun
this is what makeup is to me like this
palette is what makeup is just fun okay
guys that's everything this is my intro
we are doing an update on the ninth of
Mark and then we'll have our finale on
the first so hopefully I can make it
through some of these items / just get
more use out of them be creative just
have some fun as I make up if you want
to join in and just pick a couple items
this is a smaller project which is
really nice and for me this project is
more like picking items that may be done
get a lot of love in your collection
because they're a little more out there
and just showing them some love for
about a month and a half or so anyway I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
and I will see you guys in my next video
