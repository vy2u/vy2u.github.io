Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a project pan update on
my finish for by fools day this was
started by Veronica shares she invited
me and some other lady churn youtube to
join in on this project so i'll be
lifted down de la semana go check out
their updates this is a really fun
project because it all has to deal with
more like colorful fun items in this
project so we'll get into progress first
is something i haven't used once and
it's just because they've been doing
other tutorials but i am going to be
focusing on this and more coming up this
is the NYX jumbo eye pencil in oyster
this is my vibrant item it's really
pretty iridescent purple shade I'm
excited to use as a base and I think
it's really pretty before we get into
this too much too i'll mention i haven't
get ready with me on this look I don't
know if that's going to go up first or
this is going to go first but it was
kind of a mess oh if you want to know
how I just did you can watch that but it
was kind of crazy just a warning i guess
anyway back to these products there's no
progress to show you on that so i'll be
working on it I just want to get use out
of that one I said I wanted to use the
path I think I wouldn't might have been
high because that's crazy next we're
going to talk about the item that was
supposed to be sparkly or glittery and I
chose something that was metallic
instead this is the josie maran water
color eyeshadow as use this quite a few
times since the intro like four or so
times really pretty I'd really like the
way this looks I'm glad to be getting
some use out of it I mean I don't think
you're going to see any progress with it
this is also one I just want to use us
because i think i might just have to get
rid of this by the end of the year it's
just getting a little old and it's
probably in my best interest just to you
know move it out the next item was
something that has really pretty
packaging and i chose the moonchild
palette this is from honest Althea and I
just want to use this more I'm mostly
I'm focusing on pink heart and blue eyes
I'm actually going to put blue eyes on
right now I forgot to see that it might
get ready with me I thought it'd be cool
with these blue liner I think that's how
it's super fun I really like it alright
hopefully that looks good I don't think
I took pictures of this before so it's
not that much progress and last with
something that makes you smile or makes
you happy and this is my
k electric palette I wanted to hit pan
on the color savage here I have it in my
brows I've been trying to use it more I
mean it's something I just naturally use
I have a really big dent going in it so
i think i will hit pan on this by the
end of this project i'm excited to have
pan in this palette this is something i
really like i used slow burn today too
and i really like i don't know this
paula is just the best i love this okay
I think that's everything guys i I'm
sorry this update was a little bit you
know kind of crazy I feel like it just
kind of makes sense was to get ready
with me I had going on today so this
video was a little bit more crazy too so
sorry about that thank you so much for
watching I will see you in my next video
bye good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
