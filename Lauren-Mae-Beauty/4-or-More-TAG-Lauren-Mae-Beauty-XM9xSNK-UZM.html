Lauren thank you so much for watching if
you're interested in this look I do have
a get ready with me doing this so I'm
gonna leave that link down below I
always get questions on my eye makeup
and everything so just in case you were
wondering that's where you can find that
but in today's video we're gonna be
doing V 4 or more tag this was created
by Emily Noel this is a pretty old tag
but I was thinking about it I was like
anyone I'm gonna do that tag so we're
gonna be talking about products that I
have four or more of so whether that's
like an eye shadow single that I have
four more of I actually didn't do any
eyeshadow Singles that's like the worst
example to give you guys what the heck
am i saying but basically this is a
temporary just talked about products
that you have four or more of and you
explained weight like them obviously you
like them if you have four or more you
got to be pretty dedicated to have that
many so I'm just going to stop talking
now and we're gonna get into it I think
I'm gonna start with blushes because I
only have two brands of blushes that I
actually have four or more of the first
one are the Clinique cheek pop blushes I
really love this formula of blush I
think I had five at one point but I have
to clutter one since then so I have the
shade nude pop which is probably my
absolute favorite I think this is just
such an everyday and like nice natural
color it doesn't add too much pink but
it gives you some type of life to your
cheeks I highly recommend it these have
like a really nice satin finish on the
skin so they aren't going to look matte
but they're also not going to be too
highlighting where they like accentuate
your pores or anything I also have the
shade plum pop I use this in a video
where I did kind of like a I called it
like a snow kissed bunny look and I
really did a lot of blush on my cheeks I
did some under the nose and everything
and it was so pretty such a pretty hot
pink blush this one is kind of the one
I've used the least this is peach pop
and it's a nice peachy shade great for
summer or outing just like a pop of
color to your look and then the last one
here this one is Cola pop and this one
is so so pretty it'd be beautiful on
darker skin tones I've also used this in
an eye look I have a get ready with me
using this as an eye shadow so I'm going
to leave that link down below too but
I think this can work in so many ways so
I really like this it's unique and the
other brand of blush that I have four or
more of our d laura geller blushes I
have like seven here I think these are
so great I know a lot of people don't
like baked products but honestly I think
that they're so nice pigmentation is
going to be kind of like a medium of
pasty so you can really build it up it's
gonna look just so beautiful on the skin
so I'm just gonna read off the colors
that I have some of these might be
limited edition but I will link in the
description box every single color that
I can in case you wanted to try one so
the first one here this is the color
cherry truffle this one's really pretty
for fall and winter it gives you that
kind of like fresh from the cold look
this next one is boysenberry and this
one's actually a matte it's just like a
really pretty mob very color this is one
I haven't used a ton this is the baked
tart blush and highlighter in pink
Valentine it has a heart in the center
that is very very metallic this reminds
me of NARS orgasm because it has that
like golden glow to it this one's really
pretty but definitely not for the faint
of heart this is the base flambe blush
in peach crumble and that one's really
nice again has quite a bit of a sheen to
it the one I've used the absolute most
is Bora Bora and this is such a pretty
color I have hit pan in the corner here
I love this if I'm like wondering what I
want to wear but I want something with a
little bit more life than a nude this is
the color I go to the next one is tropic
use this is like a classic blush from
them just a pretty peach shimmery blush
I love that one so pretty and the last
one I have here is pink grapefruit which
again is very similar to the last one
just a little bit deeper I highly
suggest these i think that laura geller
makes some awesome products she is
definitely not represented enough in the
beauty YouTube world so if you get a kit
or something that's what I suggest
because these are kind of expensive on
their own but if you can get them with a
bunch of other products you can get a
better deal on them next let's talk
about eyes shadows I'm gonna go through
singles and then we'll go into palettes
I have a ton of the color pop I'm not
going to go through every single color I
have we'd be here all day these are not
the powder ones these have like that
cream goshi
you know feeling to them these are not
my favorite
okay so I went in a phase and I bought a
bunch of them and then I was like these
suck I'm not gonna buy anymore then I
bought like one and was like oh my gosh
these are so good why haven't I been
using these and why did I get rid of all
the ones I had and now I know why once
again I do like these I think you can
make them work I think you can get a
great effect on the eye and it can be
really beautiful but they dry out so
fast and I find that I just never in
reaching for them I always have to try
to reach for them and that sucks you
know what I mean that's not how I want
my makeup to be so yeah I'm sure you
guys have heard about these before it's
not like these are a new product or
anything but yeah I have like a ton of
those another single shadow that have
quite a few of our the kiss singles
these retail for four dollars each I got
these from octa Lee and I've only used
two of the colors so I did a look using
this pink which is really pretty I also
use this as a dupe for one of the colors
in the legal of palette so I think these
are good for the price but I don't think
they're very accessible so it's like
you'd have to make an order just on the
kiss website which you know that gets
into a whole nother thing if you want to
do that and then with shipping and all
of that I wish you could get these just
that like a regular drugstore or that
Ulta sold them so you could add a couple
things to your cart
and not have to make such a big order
with just kiss product to tell you the
name of that pink one no this is the
color dahlias I've also used this gold
as an inner corner highlight and it was
really really pretty a lot of people
liked it as well this is the shade chaos
and it's like a yellow gold it's looking
very like chartreuse but in real life
it's just a yellow gold color for the
price I think you get a pretty good
pigmentation on these so yeah if you
were interested in them I think they're
very good the two colors I have yet to
open are spicy which is like a really
pretty orange and then this one's a
really dark blue in Pandora so yeah I
just sometimes when I get PR makeup I
don't like to open it until I'm ready to
use it just in case I never get to it I
can pass that makeup on to someone else
or if I want to a shelter or wherever
and it's not already used it's just a
way for me to keep things fresh in my
collection you guys know that I have a
ton of single like press shadows so I'm
not going to
into that I have a ton of colour-pop and
makeup geek and look-see like I have way
more than four of all of those so that's
just a given
but last year on single eyeshadows I
wanted to mention the bare minerals
pigments because I do have quite a few
of these I feel like everyone gets
started with bare minerals or at some
point has bare minerals and I got these
at the outlet for bare minerals and I
don't use them very often but I don't
want to get rid of them there's
something about them that every time I
swatch them or whatever it is I really
do like them there's a color called
unnatural which is really pretty and has
like a really nice shift to it oh it's
so beautiful look at that so I might
even use that as a highlight I don't
know I think I might do a get ready with
me using these soon one of the colors I
really love is the shade silk rose this
one is just so pretty as like a one
shadow color all over the eye and blend
it into the crease it is a matte as well
this pigment here this is in the shade
stay golden and this one is so beautiful
it's one of those really heavy pigments
kind of like the Mac ones where has a
lot of like binder to it so it really
shows up quite metallic it's just so
pretty so if you want to see me do you
like it get ready with me or a couple
tutorials using the blues pigments let
me know because I do have a lot and I
kind of want to like get creative and do
some fun things with them so I might do
that anyway but you know if you want to
see it let me know we're gonna go into
shadow palettes now I don't have a ton
of palettes that I have four of because
that's kind of crazy but I do have a
couple actually so first here I want to
start off with the Hoonah Beauty
obsessions palette I bought all of these
in one pop so I bought four in one
transaction there is the electric
obsessions the warm Brown obsessions the
mauve obsessions and then the smokey
obsessions now I've been using these
I've been trying to get an idea of how I
feel about them the only palette that I
have yet to use is the electric which i
think is funny because right now my eye
look is pretty crazy but I have a
tutorial planned for this with a picture
that I found on LY
I really liked this picture from make up
forever and basically every single color
I would need is in here for that and
then I want to use like my star tattoo
pencil from milk so yeah I have that
coming up and I will hopefully film that
at some point hopefully before I leave
that's gonna be my goal but I'm gonna
have that up soon these are really nice
I think for the price they're $27 I
think that they're pretty dang good and
one of my more recent video is where I'm
wearing the like what is this called
life not beanie the like head where I
use the smokey obsessions to create that
look and it looks so beautiful it's just
like this classic kind of smokey eye the
biggest thing is that the textures of
the metallic shades are definitely kind
of hard to work with this one for me
keeps crumbling which is kind of
disappointing but other than that I feel
like all of the mattes blend really
nicely I think the color selection is
really nice you get a lot of product I
like the color story of all of them so
to me if you're really wanting one of
these I don't think you're gonna be
disappointed if you pick it up but just
know that these have just definitely a
texture to them I don't know what
happened to just like a normal metallic
shadow I feel like lately I've been
reaching in it's like all of these
metallic shadows just are very like
these like wet creamy formulas which
swatch beautifully but when it goes on
the eye it's just I don't know how I
feel about it I don't know how I feel
and the other palette that I have four
or more of are the color pop little mini
palettes so I did throw in the magic one
all I see is magic because it's it's not
the same size but it's the same formula
and it's you know the same situation so
I have the all I see is magic the first
one that ever came out was the yesplease
palette mine is incredibly dirty guys so
just forgive me it's because I use at a
time I use this on set a lot as well I
just love the color selection in here I
think they did an amazing job it's a
great mix of mattes and shimmers this is
the one I suggest the most out of
everything it's the one I've used the
most especially if you like those warmer
colors or if you were wanting the
Natasha to known a sunset palette the
next palette
my god like the second pallet I ever got
I don't know why I did them all I see is
magic one first because that was the
most recent one I got but anyway that is
the she pallet this one was in
collaboration with Karrueche and this
one is a really pretty palette but I
definitely can tell it's it's for darker
skin tones which i think is amazing
don't get me wrong but because I am NOT
a darker skin tone it doesn't have quite
what I need in it like these are not
transitions for me whereas they would be
on a darker skin tone and some of these
I just find I don't know I just haven't
played with this one as much so this is
the one I personally suggest the least
or the one that I've used the least next
I got the color pop I think I love you
palette this is the one I second most
recommend I think this is great for
someone who likes neutrals but wants
those just really pretty shimmery lid
shades it's everything you'd need if you
were gonna go somewhere and you wanted
to be able to have everything you'd need
this is the palette I would say like
it's just a really good one I do really
like this and this is one that I
considered not getting because it kind
of looked boring but honestly I'm so
happy with it and then the last palette
I have here is my little pony and this
one is so fun I did a like icy blue look
kind of similar to this you could
definitely get the look I'm wearing now
with this palette and I think it's
really pretty I think they did some fun
colors I know my little pony is not
everyone's favorite and it's definitely
not something that I bought for the
nostalgia of it I just liked the colors
and like that they did something fun and
fresh and new so I'm happy with this
palette since then they've come out with
probably what four other palettes still
and I want part of me wants them part of
me is just like it's too much y'all uni
like calm it down so yeah I do suggest
them though if you find one that you
like I just love the color pop formula
in the palettes that I have there I I
feel like the formula is exactly the
same as if you were gonna buy the single
shadow so I have been really happy with
those purchases I feel pretty satisfied
at the moment so I don't know if I'm
gonna pick up any other ones but I am
very happy with what I have
I have some it's like a weird product
but I have four more of them and I
thought that I've never seen them on
YouTube so I thought I would talk about
them these are all from the brand
graftobian and they are all glitters
they're so fun these are called their
glitter glam liquid skin Sparkle so I
would not suggest using these on the
area but you can use them on the face
you can use them on the body I have so
many different shades because I did do
some mermaids this year for Halloween
and I thought these products were just
so unique and so cool they make like
adding glitter to something so easy you
don't have to worry about it getting
everywhere because it's already in like
a liquid paste form so for the colors I
have the shade pink passion this one has
like an iridescent purple in it and it's
called opal neon this one is violaceous
and it's a purple with a blue sparkle I
have one that's just an iridescent and
it's called opal flash and then last
year this is the color sapphire sky
these are just fun products these aren't
gonna be for everyone obviously if
you're not like a professional makeup
artist or you're not using things like
this often I don't suggest them but I
feel like for the price they're not bad
I believe these retail for ten dollars
each and then I got my discount on them
but even at ten dollars I think that's
still a good price for glitter products
sometimes they can just charge you a ton
of money and I think these work nice and
they're pretty combinations
okay now we're moving on to lips I have
a lot of lip products so we're just
gonna like run through them I'm going to
be talking about formula I'm gonna leave
all of the colors I have listed down
below so you can check them out and I'll
tell you my like number one favorite
color out of all of them but that's kind
of it because if not it's going to take
forever and I'm trying to like keep it a
little short you know the first lip
product I want to talk about are the
lorac Pro matte lip colors I have two of
the original like formulas these are in
the original line and then I have some
from the Holiday Collection last year
these are a really nice pencil formula
you will tell from this video that I
love pencil formats when it comes to
lipsticks I don't like the traditional
bullet I like that these are just easier
to apply because they're a little bit
more precise just something about them I
just like
them the most so out of these two I
suggest the color pink taupe the most
it's a very beautiful shade it's very
similar to dolly from buxom which you
guys know I like like I mean love what
am I talking about these are a
comfortable matte on the lips they have
a vanilla scent to them which is really
nice and I think they're really great so
if you were looking for something these
are wonderful and the price point isn't
bad I think they retail for $16 which is
pretty dang nice so if you're looking
for a comfortable matte these are good I
have some lip glosses in here and these
are all from colour-pop I am on the
fence about the colourpop lip glosses I
love the shade finders-keepers I
actually got this for free in my order
because they were like late or something
and I loved it I was like oh my gosh
this is such a pretty color the formula
is really nice it's not super sticky but
it's pigmented it's this one here so I
was so excited and then I ordered some
and they sucked
this one is besties and this is the
color curvy I just don't like the way
that these go on there are totally
different formula it's like a thicker
formula and I find that curvy especially
just like accentuates the like lines in
my lips which I don't really have like
that many lines in my lips bestie isn't
too bad but I still don't love it but
then from the colour-pop collection I
ordered Pony Land and I love this this
is definitely different though too
it has like a lot of glitter in it but
it's so pretty
so um I don't know like by your own risk
because I can't even figure out which
ones I like but I do like two of the
shades I have and then I'm not so happy
with the other two so the next brand
that I have a ton of products from our
nude Stix these are all lip products and
I really like them again they're in that
like stick form which I enjoy I bought a
set earlier this year that had six
different colors there five here one of
them somewhere but I really enjoy these
these are like a like a liquid lipstick
but in a pen form it's pretty crazy so
these are
tense there a little bit drying I think
that they're beautiful for like filming
and for really short periods of time but
my preference is definitely not liquid
lipstick so if you like liquid lipsticks
I think you would like these for
everyday more my speed are the lip and
cheek pencils these are just going to be
like a really nice moisturizing formula
like the name suggests you can use them
on the lips or the cheeks I think that
they're so beautiful they have some
really beautiful nude colors my favorite
one is mystic which I actually don't
have anymore because I used it all the
way up I actually had it in my kit I
have a bunch of other shades in my kit
as well of the lip colors I think that
they're just really really nice they're
a bit pricey at $24 a piece but if
you're really wanting to treat yourself
to like that one perfect nude I think
you will really like mystic check that
one out I think it'll work for a lot of
different skin tones it's gonna be like
a lighter nude on darker skin it's gonna
be a little bit of a darker nude on
lighter skin but it's a really nice
universal shade and I really love the
formula
I think this brand is really cool as
well and last for lip products here I
have the NARS lip pencils they have a
satin lip pencil as well as a velvet lip
pencil which is matte and I like both
formulas but I think I do prefer the
mattes the most they stay on the lips
really well in one of my more recent
videos I was wearing this red which is
the color eye beer Co this is limited
edition I got a set of them usually at
Christmas time they'll come out with
holiday sets of the lip pencils and I
highly suggest checking those out and
seeing if those are colors that you like
because it's a better way to get them at
a more affordable price I have bought a
full-size though this is the color
patina and it's just a really pretty
kind of sheer nude it looks really nice
on the lips like nothing too special but
it just kind of finishes out the look I
also love rikugien this is in the satin
and that one's really nice as well so I
highly suggest these pencils I have a
color called
let's go crazy which is a pink and that
looks so pretty too so yeah these are
one of my favorite formulas and that's
my forum or tag I didn't put anything in
here that was strictly in my kit
so if I had like foundations or things
like that I just thought this video
would get way too long I think seeing
what people have decided to buy four or
more of is a pretty good indicator that
that product is pretty good that it's
like a staple in their collections so
yeah let me know what some of your
favorite products are down below that
you have four or more of and I will see
you in the next video thank you so so
much for watching guys and I'll see you
in the next one like I just said bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
