Lauren this is going to be my first
video on five first impressions I have
five different products here from hard
candy that I picked up hard candy is
only sold at Walmart so if you're
interested in any of these items or just
hard candy in general definitely hit up
your local Walmart to show you the five
products I'll be testing today first I
have the hard candy sheer envy primer
this is the shine free version I picked
up the glamoflage foundation this is in
the shade porcelain I thought I would
try it there highlighter and contouring
stick this is in the shade light we'll
see how that goes something fun that I
picked up this is their liquid liner and
this is a glitter liner in the color
white night and last I have a lip gloss
this is the plumping serum volumizing
lipgloss I'm not really a lip product
person but I thought I would test out if
this actually feels volumizing what the
scent is all of that type of stuff so
let's just hop into it my face
is completely bare obviously I have
freshly washed it moisturized it so I'm
gonna go in to prime since this is the
first impression I have never tried
these products all of them were like in
their packaging so we'll see how this is
I haven't used hard candy stuff and so
long oh it has a seal on it that's
impressive don't you hate when you go to
the drugstore and you realize that
something you bought was opened by
someone else that's the worst always
makes me so mad but I'm not gonna lie I
have open stuff myself to like try
something I don't do it all the time
so don't hate me but I'm trying to not
break my nails since I just painted them
we finally have it open okay I'm just
gonna take that much it seems like a lot
but we'll see how it spreads out it
doesn't really have a scent maybe like
lightly sweet or something and I'm just
gonna spread that all around it feels
nice and silicone E but not quite as
slick as like the Smashbox photo-finish
are the maybelline baby skin I don't
know it feels nice I like it I
definitely feel like it'll be a nice
smoothing base for my foundation usually
go in with like a second primer just
like fill in my pores but since that one
had like a kind of a smoothing texture
itself I think I'm just gonna see how it
works by itself to see if I need that
extra
so I'm not gonna add that let's just go
in with foundation that would be my next
step again this is in the shade
porcelain and this is the lightest color
I know a lot of people use this as like
a foundation mixer I'm trying to open it
still I'd rather in my teeth in my nails
this has a pump which is a relief that's
so nice so I'm just gonna give it a
shake pump it on my hand I did two pumps
so that's what two pumps looks like it's
pretty thick it's not like running down
my hand I'm gonna go in this is probably
a little too light for me I feel like
stuff is usually too dark holy shoot
this is super light so we're gonna have
to bronze I don't think the highlighting
sticks gonna do anything for me I feel
like I'm in between fair and light like
light is too dark sometimes and fair
used to work for me but I feel like
maybe I'm too starter yeah this is
really freaking lying no wonder everyone
uses it as a mixer it's just making it
look like a ghost honestly yeah I don't
know I just I thought I was that like
I'm gonna go get something just a little
darker just so that I can make this a
little more wearable so I just added in
like a BB cream that's in the shade
medium first impressions coverage wise I
don't really like it I don't know it's
not really blending out a nicely to me
with my Beauty Blender and I know that
if it wouldn't do nice with this like I
don't think a brush would help because
although I have oily skin I find when I
use a brush any dry patches I have just
get like pick it up and look flaky
because I'm buffing so I like to kind of
like press foundation into my skin I
don't know I just don't feel like this
is giving me coverage I think it should
and the texture is kind of weird you
would expect it to be almost like Lucy
and moisturizing on the skin since it's
so thick but when you're blending it out
it's pretty thin feeling still I don't
know not impressed I just don't feel
like that much coverage like you can see
quite a bit and on the back it says a
transforming liquid a liquid powder
maybe that's why foundation that absorbs
oil camouflages imperfections
delivers a long-lasting velvet finish
I'd agree with the velvet part like it's
not overly dewy and I feel like any of
the dew that might be coming off is
because of that BB cream but it's just
not quite enough coverage for me and I
don't feel like I'm like a coverage
person I just definitely still see like
just redness even so that's a little bit
of a bust but um I don't know we'll see
if it can hold my oil throughout the day
that might be a little bit more
impressive to me I'm just gonna conceal
do a little concealing before I move on
to the next step I have all the
concealer blended out so I'm gonna go in
with the highlighting and contours and
sits cream before we go in and set
anything with powders I'm still kind of
waiting for it to like set down and have
it yet but again I I hate that I have to
mix it because I feel like I can't get
like a true read off of that foundation
but this is the contouring stick I think
that packaging is really nice I mean
it's still cheap but I like that it's
like rose gold looks nice
first I'm gonna contour this is the
contouring side it's nice and cool tone
that's a swatch of it I think that looks
like a really nice color I'm just going
to contour where you would I am gonna do
a little bit of a nose contour this
feels pretty dang creamy hopefully I'm
not screwing myself over with like
trying to put it all on at once you know
but um let's see how it blends out I
feel like that blended in pretty nice
it's pretty light so it's not too harsh
or anything I also like that it didn't
turn orange II I feel like sometimes
with contouring products like as they
shear out it just leaves like little
remnants of orange and so far - I feel
like could be a good product for like
beginners or anyone who's kind of scared
of like cream products because they
blend out so nice and they're pretty
sheer I feel like you know you're not
gonna put them on and then be stuck so
far I'm liking the contour side let's
try the highlight that's how much
products in it - I thought I'd show you
I think that's a decent amount of
product I think this is like six dollars
or something I'm gonna go just like all
the way under the eye kind of want to
see if I could almost use this as like
as my concealer plus I still do have a
bit of redness showing through and I'm
just going underneath the contour trying
to do the full thing since I'm using
contrasting again super creamy I feel
like you could probably go through this
though if you use it everyday and like a
lot of it you could go through this
really fast I like this better than the
foundation that's for sure I feel like
it covers better my first impressions of
that foundation are not very good now
because this is so creamy I'm wondering
how it's gonna hold up throughout the
day on my oily skin but hopefully that
primer will come through okay that's it
so far I'm going to set my face with
powder do basically the rest of my base
makeup and also do my eye makeup and
brows and stuff and then we'll come back
and test out the last two products which
are the glitter eyeliner and the lip
gloss so I've done my face and my eyes
obviously and my brows that's an
important one I will say as I've been
doing that I just am NOT a fan of the
foundation and even the contour product
I want to try it on its own without the
foundation I don't know I just feel like
I have a lot of redness still like right
here on my cheeks and I have redness
there naturally but I just feel like the
product is not holding very well there
and all I've done is like sweep away
some glitter which there is quite a bit
of glitter on my face right now for a
matte look but I don't know I just I
definitely don't feel like I'm feeling
the foundation my forehead looks nice
though this is definitely a problem area
for most foundations I just I'm just not
a fan so far back so anyway let's move
on let's try out the glitter liner next
I'm really excited for this and I kind
of chose this I look for this liner
specifically that's it there so let's
take out the wand the wand doesn't look
like it too covered in product oh yeah
this is gonna be so pretty okay let's
put this on the inner corner I already
have like a gold shadow going but I'm
going to add some glitter I'm gonna
bring it down into the lower lash line I
really like this product I think it
works really nicely I'll see how long it
like lasts but something that is
interesting about it is it's not like
glitter glitter it's almost like a
shimmer in here so it's definitely
bringing some brightness to my inner
corner I don't think you could actually
use this as like a liner liner I don't
think it could get quite opaque enough
but it definitely has like an
sin or something like that it's really
nice let's try it the last item and see
how we like it
this is the plumping serum volumizing
lipgloss and this is in the color nude
beach I'm just gonna put a little bit of
this on my hand the DOE foot looks nice
it's pretty big and I'm just gonna go
straight in with the lip gloss on my
lips I'm not gonna use any other
products because I find that with lip
plumping things sometimes if you have
like a barrier it can't actually get to
your lip and actually start working I'm
using like a super big brush just
because this is what I have
how's like a vanilla cupcake kind of
scent but it doesn't have like an
overwhelming taste it's s Li just like a
scent and when you breathe in which I
was a little surprised because I thought
it might be minty it's pretty shiny but
nothing like too insane I mean it is
applause stick wise I feel like it's in
the middle it's not too sticky but it's
tacky enough but I feel like it might
stay on a little bit longer than like a
butter gloss overall I think it's nice I
feel like opacity wise it's kind of in
the middle too it's not like insanely
sheer but you can put it over a ton of
different lip products it's not gonna
like change the look entirely since I've
been talking I definitely I'm starting
to feel the plumping it's kind of that
like minty sensation but initially I
don't feel like I smelt the mint so I'm
feeling it the most like right on the
inside where the outside and the inside
of my lips are kind of meeting it's not
hurting it's just kind of like just
feeling like mint it's on there like a
peppermint oil is on my lips or
something so I'm gonna go throughout my
day I'm gonna check in with you guys
maybe halfway through the day or maybe
just at the end or maybe both not sure
I've never done this style video before
I will come back and let you guys know
what my final first impressions are at
the end of the day okay guys I am back
I'm just doing a little bit of an update
I just went out and about I think it's
about 4 15 ish maybe 4:30 I started
filming at about like 12:30 so it's been
on about about 4 hours
overall I think that makeup looks okay I
have a little bit of like creasing here
I do wear glasses so that's what that's
from so I'm going to tap that out I do
feel like oily right here
a little bit on the forehead mostly
though the nose and the cheeks I do
think it's rubbing off a little bit on
my chin and looks a little patchy I'm
gonna zoom in so you guys can see it um
so just like now my favorite I just
don't feel like super confident in my
skin I'd rather be wearing other
products that I already own in my
collection when it comes to the
foundation the glitter on the inner
corner is staying but there is a lot of
fallout and that is not from that it's
from the eye look actually so overall I
like the glitter liner the lip gloss did
come off about two hours in and I didn't
eat or drink anything and there is
glitter like glitter Sparkle left over
hopefully you guys can see it so I don't
think it's that bad it's not like the
Revlon like glitter bombs or whatever I
would still like put this on someone but
definitely something to take now I also
felt like the glitter was a little
gritty not like bad at all but I mean I
kind of could feel it it wasn't just
totally untraceable anyway and then I
also blend it out here but if you can
see on my chin there's just a lot of
alright it just looks a little patchy my
nose is looking a little patchy I'm just
not a fan of the foundation so we'll
check in on a later date I'll stop being
so zoomed in okay guys I'm just doing an
update really fast in my bathroom so
this is a date o'clock right now so this
is it after about almost eight hours
okay so first things first foundation
tamales I'm feeling the same way it's
okay I do have a lot of coming off my
nose but I did accidentally rub it so
that's partially my fault there's a lot
coming off of my chin I feel like the
color is not too bad though once I mixed
it so that's good I guess I'm not sure
if I'm going to keep the foundation or
if I'm going to return it I might keep
it to mix I'm sorry I didn't trust
everyone who said that it's a good mix
it's just a good mixing foundation for
the color look I also think the
highlight and contour stick is pretty
nice mostly just the contour stick but I
just think it's a nice product I
definitely am not disappointed I think
it's pretty good so I'm gonna keep the
contour stick thumbs up let's talk about
the liner you know I said I liked it the
most but we're I'm gonna zoom in
I fast so don't be scared but take a
look at that I hope it's in focus um it
kind of looks like an eye booger got
crusted up and there's some glitter
mixed in on my inner corner so I am not
feeling that I think because it's not
just you know the thing I talked about
why it's a good thing like the shimmer
or whatever no I wish it was just
particles of glitter and a base that
kind of just dried and went away because
this just looks like flaky and seriously
like glitter eye boogers which no no no
no no so I'm probably gonna return that
to I that's just disgusting I might keep
it for something but not like I'm not
gonna use it on my inner corner anymore
and then last lipgloss I never realised
didn't dry my lips out it's okay I think
it's a nice gloss if you just need a
regular gloss it does have some glitter
in it it's not necessarily a bad thing
if you're getting it though for plumping
it really only works for like three
seconds after two hours you're
definitely gonna have to reapply so if
you're looking for like the longest
wearing gloss ever definitely not it I
think that's everything sorry for like
the weird update but I think this is how
my updates out then in the night are
gonna because lord knows I don't want to
set up lights though Oh primer I almost
forgot heard the primer I think the
primer worked really well let's talk
about shine really fast I feel like I'm
a little bit shiny on my nose like in
this portion right here also on this
portion a little on the chin but I feel
like for all day or you know almost
eight hours it's just not nearly as
greasy as I feel like I normally am so
I'm giving that to the primer and not
the foundation I'm really excited for
the primer I'm gonna try it tomorrow
with like my normal stuff and see how it
works I'll keep you guys posted that's
everything for real I will see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
