Lauren this is going to be another five
first impressions video and this is on
the brand Maybelline I've been trying to
keep it drugstore just one cuz it's
cheaper to do first impressions of drug
source stuff and there's a lot stuff
from Maybelline that I feel like I
haven't tried that's new or I've heard
things about or is semi new like it's
not actually that new but you know so
the five things that I want to test
today are the better skin foundation
this is in the shade ivory which I
believe is the second to lightest shade
I also have the matching powder and this
is the super say better skin powder in
number 10 porcelain I decided to also
pick up an eye primer this is the master
prime and I believe it's just the
regular one it says prime and smooth in
410 so I don't have any eye primers
right now in my personal collection so
I'm excited and hopefully this works
this is something that's been intriguing
me since it came out I've heard bad
reviews I've heard good reviews and I
kind of just wanted to kind of make my
own opinion on this and see how it works
for me and the last thing this is a
lipstick and this is from the loaded
bold collection this is in the color
sapphire siren and it's kind of this
like indigo color I feel like if you put
it next to purple it looked blue if you
put it next to blue it looked purple I
thought this would look nice with the
eyeshadow palette if I did kind of like
a rosy kind of look I don't know I'm
gonna just go for it let's just get into
it I have nothing on my face except for
moisturizer so I'm gonna go in and Prime
i'm using the becca ever matte poreless
primer and I'm just gonna smooth at all
over my face now that I have a primer on
I'm just gonna go in and start putting
the foundation on so the claims on this
I know it's supposed to have something
in it to help your skin throughout time
so it's like you're not only covering it
but hopefully like healing your skin or
just like making your skin better a
hence the name better skin but um I
don't really care about that I just care
if it looks good or not and if it
doesn't make me a late okay I think this
is about three pumps so that's it there
so far I like the consistency it's
pretty thick but doesn't seem like too
thick it just doesn't run i am going to
be applying it with my Beauty Blender
just because that's my favorite way to
apply foundation so I'm gonna just Pat
this on
face
I think that the shade is okay it's a
little more until eight or like to dark
really hopefully it doesn't oxidize too
much so that was like a super light
first coat because I really didn't like
I don't feel like dot it everywhere I
like it so far I'm liking it I think it
looks good feels good I think the colors
pretty okay so I'm gonna go in and just
kind of like put it just straight on my
blender and just go in to the areas i
feel like i need more coverage and see
how it built up
okay that's me with the rest of what was
on my hand on my face so far I do like
it I'm not like in love but I'm not
disappointed or anything I don't know I
think it's pretty good I kind of just
want to see how worse throughout the day
to me I think there's just something
about being under these lights that I
just feel like I see so much texture
like even more than normal so I always
feel like it's kind of tricks me and
sometimes it's nice to see like in
natural light or whatever I still feel
like the colors a little bit orange
overall it's okay but I don't find that
it really caked up anywhere I feel like
it looks nice like my skin still looks
like skin which is really awesome it did
give me pretty dang decent coverage I
wouldn't say it's full I'd say it's like
a good medium coverage I'm gonna go
ahead and conceal under my eyes this is
the Maybelline master conceal in the
color light and I'm going to go under my
eyes and really just pinpoint it on a
few of the breakouts I have concealer is
probably one of my favorite parts of the
beauty routine because this is so nice
you can use it as foundation but just
brightens and makes you look like a
human foundation and concealer is on
let's move on to powder I'm gonna bust
into this I think it still has oh no it
has nothing to keep people from getting
into it okay so this is what the compact
looks like it's quite large I guess I
kind of want to keep the powder light so
I'm going to go in with this elf
complexion brush and just kind of dip
that into the powder and set my face
although i will say i feel like the
foundation did a really nice job of
setting so if you aren't super oiling
you're just like combo or even if you're
like dry you probably wouldn't have to
set this I think the powder is nice it's
definitely yellow toned which I found
that the concealer on this which I have
used in the past is very dilute on as
well so if you're fair with a yellow
undertone you might really like this I
think it has pretty good coverage it's
definitely not like translucent I don't
know it's not my favorite powder it's
okay it's like a little heavy looking
I'm so sorry for the dog but I'm gonna
go in and bronze and contour so two
bronze i'm using the butter bronzer and
to contour just a little bit i'm going
to
using the Smashbox contour kit and I'm
gonna using the contour color I'm
Jennifer bronzer and contour i will say
i did notice that when i was doing my
nose contour that it picked up a little
bit of the product but i don't think
that that is necessarily the foundations
fault i do get that sometimes and also
have a lot of texture on my nose so i
just wanted to point that out i'm going
to go in in prime so we'll be using the
next portion of this testing video this
is the eye primer i'm excited i like
that this has some coverage to it we'll
just see i'm just going for it I
definitely don't think you need as much
as I put on um it has kind of a I don't
know it feels like a primer like a face
primer Elmo's it kind of reminds me
actually of the texture of the by Terry
one which is that like hyaluronic one
which I found that if i put too much it
was just I don't know it would just go
everywhere so I definitely think you
just need the tiniest amount don't go
crazy this feels just like that by Terry
one which is really nice because that's
a very expensive primer this does have a
little bit of shimmer to it it's not
completely like just like a cream but it
also doesn't look like shimmer either i
think it just has like a healthy glow to
it doesn't have a ton of coverage but it
does just even out the slightest bit so
far I like it but the real test is if it
doesn't make my eyeshadows crease if my
eyeshadows don't crease throughout the
day next real fast I am going to do my
eyebrows so I will be back with my
eyebrows done I have my eyebrows on so
we are going to move on to eyeshadow i
think i'm gonna zoom in guys in just so
you can see i haven't swatched these at
all i've done like nothing with these
it's not even open you just broke the
seal so this is what the palette looks
like it's like blush tones but also kind
of cool toned so first things I'm gonna
go in with the shade here and kind of
just set my primer it's a little
shimmery but I'm hoping it'll be fine
I'm just gonna kind of keep it on the
lid just in case I kind of want to do
something with like this and maybe that
so I'm going to take a blending brush
and I'm gonna go in
the shade this is a matte and blend that
into my crease so far out of the two
shades I've used I don't think it's like
horrible it's not like crazy pigmented
but if something's kind of sheer and you
have to build it up that's not totally
bad to me because then you can kind of
build up the opacity you want and you
can get a better blend sometimes like as
long as they can blend to me that's not
a big deal so far I like the way that
looks so let's move on i'm going to take
kind of a flattish brush and this color
i'm going to put that all over the lid I
know that's not trying a million colors
from the palette but I need to keep in
mind that i'm using a blue lip color so
and i'm just trying to pack that on as
much as I can with my brush onto the lid
I did get a tiny bit of folic so I'm
just gonna brush that away again overall
I mean I think that's pretty good i
don't think it's like amazing but I mean
for a drugstore and the fact that this
is ten dollars I'm gonna go in and just
pack it on the thigh finger I do that
all the time with the regular shades ok
cool I'm gonna take this color here and
I'm just gonna put that on the outer
corner just to bring home the rosiness
of this look I don't really want to
darken it too much I'd rather have it
more colorful than like dark and I am
getting some fallout with this so I
added that to the sides I don't really
like the way that looked I don't know
why this these two sheets have their
very creamy feeling um so I don't know
it just doesn't seem like it's blending
grew wide enough apply brush or not
you're gonna get soft looks but if
you're looking for like everyday type of
stuff I think this is nice for the price
is it high-end at all or beat high-end
definitely not but I don't think it's
like just crap you know what I mean I
don't know I like a light look though so
maybe that's it I did get a lot of fall
at this oh I'm gonna have to go back in
with concealer I'm just gonna use a
little bit more of that Maybelline and
just clean up under the eye I'm going to
tightline using an eye line
I like underneath and smudge it a little
on the bottom lash line I'm also going
to add some mascara too so I'll be right
back okay so I have my mascara on my top
lashes i use the realist ill of makeup
volumizing mascara and then for the
eyeliner i use the pop beauty kajal pen
in the shade braund bonanza since i got
up to do my makeup in like a different
area where i normally get ready i will
say i think of the foundation looks
really nice I do really like it it kind
of looks like it looks like skin and
even the powdered parts still look kind
of Dewey um but not in a bad way just
like just again like skin not super
powdered so I feel a little bit better
about that my eyeshadows are very
glittery i'm still not like a hundred
percent hating on them but I there's a
lot of glitter so yeah I thought I'd
finish up the bottom of the I going in
with some more shadow I'm gonna take
this same like this color and I'm going
to put it on the lower lash line and
smudge it into the liner I lie down and
I'm going to add some mascara to to my
bottom lashes okay so let's do a little
bit of a blush because I feel like I'm
getting lost this is from Tarte and it
is the celebrated blush I wanted
something neutral but like a little bit
warm I feel like I can really like pack
this one on I'm also going to highlight
really fast before we move on to the
lips this is a highlighter from
philosophy but it's discontinued man I
brought that blush up kind of high we'll
just roll with it today I guess I'm just
a blushed out girl last thing let's put
this little color on so we can move on
for the day this is it I don't have a
lip liner so I'm just gonna go for go
for gold there it is applied I don't
know if it's like the best application
ever but we'll see how long it lasts it
does make your teeth look yellow it's
okay I feel like it's pretty creamy even
though it's mad so you definitely need
two layers to get it to look opaque and
see in there I just feel like it's gonna
wear off I don't think this is like a
long-term color just from using it it's
very creamy though it looked pretty for
a picture but
I don't know it's not like practical to
me I feel like this is the color you
would want a liquid lipstick in I will
see you guys when I check up I'm going
to film a couple more videos do some
things I'll check in with you probably
just tonight and let you know unless
there's like a major breakthrough I'll
see you then hey guys I thought I would
do a little update so far everything
looks pretty good i am getting a little
oily i put this on about one o'clock and
it's almost five ish so it's been on
like almost four hours the foundation I
mean it's not super oily right now but
it would be a good time to like blotter
powder the lips are wearing off a little
in the middle I haven't really had
anything to eat or drink or anything so
that's just like natural where but
they're still comfortable less creamy
but still comfortable so far I'm feeling
it there's a little bit of like glitter
falling down my eyes it's not like huge
chunks I don't know it's nothing like
that bothers me a ton like I'm irritated
but it's also like that kind of sucks oh
yeah i'll update you guys later okay
guys is this going to be my final update
i believe it's like nine something at
night so this has definitely been on for
a good eight hours and as you can tell
I'm very Oh touchin it I'm oiling in my
t-zone and I mean it's not the worst
oily I've ever been it's not the best
oily or like least oily I've ever been
but but i really like the way the
foundation looks I find that a lot of
foundations once they start like the
oils breaking through they kind of like
patch off and this looks really good so
I'm really excited to try this
foundation a couple more times after
this just to kind of get a feel of how
it looks and where's with like normal
day where today I didn't do that much it
is the eighth so it's mine at sams
anniversary but it's also the election
so I didn't really do like a time mostly
YouTube stuff and then we went and voted
it went for dinner so um we didn't do a
lot I wasn't outside I wasn't sweating
foundation wise i'm excited i still like
it and i'm still excited powder I feel
the same way the eyeshadow primer I
really like there's no creasing creepy
like one eye closed shot here I did go
back through the footage of me like
filming earlier today and I will say
that the eyeshadow look is very light on
camera I mean there's just nothing
special it's ten dollar
which is kind of expensive for drug
store I don't know I haven't tried the
darker colors I'm still going to test it
out and see if I like it I was like an
everyday type of thing but I mean there
are so many other things out there that
are better I guess I didn't expect it to
be amazing maybe that's something it's
just like yeah that's a drugstore
eyeshadow palette like I don't know
that's what I expected from abling and
then last obviously there is no purple
on my lips we had burgers so uh this
lipstick didn't stand a chance I feel
like it wore pretty nice it was patching
off a little bit or just like more
translucent on the inner portion of my
lips I didn't find that it bled it
although I think it'd be nice for like
four hour wear but you'd have to touch
up after that again like I said in the
video i think it's just better as a
liquid lipstick so you'd have to worry
about it moving around but it was nice
it's a fun color definitely unique for
the drugstore especially so anyway those
are where my impression stand now I hope
you guys are having a wonderful night
and I will see you in my next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
