Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a 5 first impression
video on new wet-and-wild products we've
all seen like 10 million videos on all
the new drugstore items and went wild I
think kind of takes the cake for how big
their new ranges they have so many new
products it's crazy I was in Walgreens
in Arizona when I was there seeing
family and I picked up five products off
the display I tried to keep it cool and
just pick up products that I really
thought that I would actually use I am a
part of the project panning community so
I am more focused on like using up my
product so that was kind of my
inspiration behind buying these things I
thought that I would actually use other
than just like showing you guys let's
give into the products I picked up this
is the photo focus foundation and this
is in nude ivory I'm not sure if the
shade will work for being will see it's
supposed to look good and like all
different lighting and not give you
flashback I've never tried a foundation
from Wet n Wild I've really only stuck
to their eye shadows and eye products so
I'm excited to try this to go along with
that I also picked up the concealer this
is the photo focus concealer imagine
that and this is in the shade light
ivory this is the lightest one I could
see there not sure if it is less one in
the range but we'll see how they work
together they did have a new mascara and
I kind of regret not picking that up but
I did pick up the liquid liner this is
in black and it's supposed to be a
really skinny like I think felt tip
liquid eyeliner pen and I'm so excited
if this works that would be amazing this
was I think 3 99 or $4.99 which is a
steal compared to other liquid liner so
I really hope this works and then other
than that I picked up two lip products
so the first one they have a range of
bombs and I picked up the clear one I
know I'm really adventurous this is
their gel lip balm and this is in kiss
clear transparent I did want to pick up
the other ones because I just didn't
feel like I would actually want to use
them after the try on so this I got I
can use a clear lip balm anyone can use
a clear lip balm so I picked that up
hopefully it's good and the last thing
that I picked up was the first gel lip
liner I got the color bear to comment
I hope this will be good I'm really
excited it's just like the nudist one I
feel like out of all of them and we'll
see how this goes so I'm just opening
the lip balm now we'll see how this is
I'm wondering if there's gonna be like a
scent on this or how this gel
consistency is going to be if I can open
it so that's what it looks like it's
kind of thick it's pretty thick this has
like no smell which I think some people
like I wish I had something kind of even
just like lemon or mint it has a very
thin consistency as you can see it's
really glossy on the lips and it's okay
we'll see how it moisturizes I'm just
gonna happen on my lips as I do the rest
of my makeup so my lips are nice and
moisturized when I go in at the end so
far um first impressions about my
favorite I don't recommend it just get
like a Burt's Bees or something else you
know let's go in with the foundation I
know this has like a spatula I believe
oh yeah this has a spatula so I'm just
gonna put some of this on the back of my
hand I don't know it's like a medium
it's not like Mozy but it's not like
insanely runny like some of those like
powder liquid to powder foundations this
is definitely pink toned so that's what
I put on and I'm going to first take a
brush on one half of my face is the Real
Techniques buffing brush yes and I'm
just gonna go in and see how this goes I
think this is supposed to be full
coverage and I feel like it does have
quite a bit of coverage off of what I've
put on so far this is all of this is
quite strong I've heard that and I
definitely think that as well yeah it
does smell like paint and I'm just
trying to put like a light layer on this
house like um kind of a more
moisturizing feel so I'm a little
nervous already with my oily skin so
that's how much I've left on this is
like one layer on that side in a
close-up view I mean it looks nice on
the skin it's more luminous than I'm
used to because I do like a matte finish
but it looks nice like it doesn't look
bad so I'm going to go in with the rest
of this and with my Beauty Blender and
try the other half and see how it
applies I did like the way the brush
applied it though I will say
for me I think color wise this actually
works really well if you can see I'm out
of this I'm going to add a little bit
more and just even with what I've done
so far with the sponge definitely gives
less coverage than the brush
so as you could tell I did go over with
the sponge-like on both sides
I just out of habit so sorry this is
sign I did the brush with and definitely
just more coverage I am gonna go in with
a second layer and just use the brush
and just kind of have all the areas I
find there's just a little bit of
redness
I think the coverage is really nice I'm
not used to something so liquid you I
feel like most of the foundations that I
use their consistencies tend to be a
little bit thicker cuz they're like
mattifying and for oily skin that's what
I gravitate to and a little bit more
full coverage but I will say I think it
looks nice especially for the price I
mean this foundation I think retails for
$5.99 and that's without like any
coupons or anything so I think so far I
do like it it's more about how it's
gonna wear for me so just like first
impressions on this I just feel like
it's a little bit greasy or heavy it
does give a nice luminous finish if you
have like normal to dry skin I feel like
you might like this so far with how it's
wearing I don't think it does anything
for me texture wise like I don't feel
like it looks smoother or anything yeah
so far it just kind of so-so I
definitely can feel it on my skin though
and it doesn't feel dry yet like I don't
know it feels just slightly like tacky
moisturizer which is just a weird
sensation for me for what I usually use
let's get into the concealer since you
know that's the next step I really
really want this to work out I have high
expectations it would be amazing if this
was great but I'm scared
Omo it's pretty light okay good it's
weird because this is quite yellow toned
compared to the foundation I don't know
if you need this much this is really
thick like even though it's a liquid cuz
it's like with a doe foot it's pretty
dang thick like think more Kat Von D
didn't like me blame fit me I really
like the packaging no I'm not so let's
see how it blends out with the Beauty
Blender I always blend my concealers out
with the Beauty Blender
definitely really thick but it's
blending out nice I think this looks
really nice definitely not a natural
look though like it doesn't look bad but
it definitely doesn't look undetectable
or anything so if you like a really
natural like skin looking finish this
probably isn't for you but if you like
to look beat or whatever um you might
like this I feel like it might crease a
lot though just because of the
consistency of it I don't know if it'll
just like so it Silla
it has good coverage though I think that
thickness really helps it cover so I
mean for drugstore products especially
the fact that these aren't drugstore
products that are like $15 for
foundation and $10 for a concealer I'm
not complaining here let's take a closer
look though and see how that blended out
again I kind of just feel like it's the
same thing I was saying if you like
makeup and you like looking like you
wear makeup not in a bad way just like
you know you like to look done up I
think you'll like these products so far
especially if these hold up on me like
this concealer will work for people who
are younger or don't have like fine
lines and wrinkles someone who is okay
with it looking like they have makeup on
it's definitely not gonna give you an
undetectable finish so that's why it's
kind of like if you're more mature this
might not work maybe it does just like
by the way it feels to me I'd want to
thin it out I guess like I feel like I
have makeup on right now I'm gonna go in
and lightly set that with my Rimmel stay
matte I feel like with these products I
don't want to go too heavy
sorry about my phone I definitely think
I need to set them though because
they're too like emollient I definitely
don't feel like I could blend stuff on
top of it without setting it and I don't
think it will stay on my skin without
setting it so I'm going to do a bronzer
blush and highlighter I'll come back and
show you guys what I use and I'm also
going to do my eyebrows and even my eye
makeup and then move on to the liner
we're almost we're almost done here I
mean I was mostly based products so um I
will come back with everything ready to
do this part I'll be back guys so I've
done my face my eyebrows and the
beginning portion of my eyes for my
brows are used the Physicians Formula
bronze booster and medium to dark for I
blush I use the Torino Tarantino
Neapolitan lane blush something really
neutral I'm working on using this glow
kit a little bit more so I used
marshmallow today it's a like
golde shift highlighter on my eyebrows I
use my elf pencil and then for my eyes
I'm using my morphe and kathleenlights
palette I will have a four looks one
palette on this look as well as
obviously other looks I'll leave it link
down below once it's up in case you want
to see how I did this so now let's go in
with the liquid liner this I am so
excited for I'll give you this watch on
the back of my hand oh my gosh this
packaging I am victorious this is so
skinny guys um yeah can you hear that
I'm so excited let's see so look at that
this is a super tiny felt tip like when
they tell you it's tiny it really
actually is let's get into doing a
little bit of a wing I'm gonna speed
this up so hopefully I don't mess about
fingers crossed that's always the goal
you
a few issues so I'm gonna go in and
conceal despite that it's not the fact
of a concealer actually we are it's not
the fact of the eyeliner um I actually
really like the eyeliner I think it
works really well it was the fact that I
just don't do winged eyeliner very often
obviously this got really thick really
like the way that this one turned out
lots of control if you're new I highly
suggest this I really like the way it
got my inner corner I find that I have
hooded eyes so if I do too thick of a
line on the inside I can just like close
off my whole eye and I was really able
to get a really nice thin precise line
on the inner corner and that's what I'm
talking about so hopefully this stays
all day that would be really the test
other than that I will like I'm into it
and the price it's so black it's not
like crazy matte but it's not super
shiny either
I mean I will say our liner does look
nice I know I talk a lot of crap about
it but I'm just going in and blending to
where I had to you know fix so there we
are with eyeliner I'm gonna go in and
finish my eyes and then we'll do the
lips I'm a mascara and I just use the
pear cosmetics fully-charged mascara I
wanted to show you really fast like
these are the swatches of that and I'm
like rubbing and it's like staying put
I really hope that stays on my eyes I
think I might work out tonight I'm not
entirely sure so um yeah we'll see how
this looks at the gym I'm gonna look hot
on that treadmill let's go into the lip
liner I'm really excited I hope it's not
too pinky and not too orange I'm gonna
fill my whole lip in with it but first
I'm just gonna classily rub off the lip
balm we were using and I'm just gonna
line my lips and fill it in
so that's the lip color all filled in
I'm not a fan of the color it's just
like a little to oranjee especially I
was like what I was wanting to go for
for this look so um maybe when I'm
really smooth bill it looks nice and
matte I want to try the other colors
especially because these are really
affordable so I think it'll be good I
just personally don't want this color
pick now
gosh dang I am so popular so although
this is for that I'm not gonna wear this
I'm gonna be putting a color over it
since it is just like a lip liner this
is Lumiere from colour-pop
I didn't show this in my haul but I
didn't get this color too I just wanted
something a little cooler you know not
so warm so this is the final look guys
um
first impressions wise I feel like if
you really want to try out the
foundation in the concealer go for it
again it's not gonna be like a super
natural finish I definitely can feel it
on my skin it does look a little heavy
in my pores it's not the worst
foundation ever especially again for the
price so I don't know if I would
repurchase this I probably will try to
use this up or mix it in with other
products feel like it gives pretty good
coverage if you don't have like oily
skin maybe go for it I think that it
would work better on someone with normal
skin the concealer I feel like it's
pretty thick so if you like thick
concealer under the eyes go for it has a
lot of coverage again I will finish this
up but I don't know if I would
repurchase it I definitely way prefer my
Maybelline fit me just consistency it
still has good coverage but it doesn't
feel so heavy the balm I don't suggest
just like skip it go for something else
who's a liner that's my favorite part of
this whole look I definitely suggest the
liner that is of course hoping that it
wears well I will leave everything in
the description bar on how it like looks
and I might try to take some pictures
maybe footage of my face like at the end
of the night before I take it off but
this is like my top product I definitely
like this first impressions on this are
really good you could do a super tiny
wing or go crazy like me I really like
this if you're looking for precision I'm
so happy that a drugstore option that is
so affordable is
good and last lipliner the lipliner was
nice I'm definitely gonna probably pick
up a couple other ones but color wise it
just wasn't my favorite especially for
the slug it didn't feel like it was
gonna be one of those ones that dried
down and then didn't budge I think that
it won't slip around but it's not too
moisturizing either cause a nice matte
finish them those are my first
impressions we'll see I might leave
footage at the end of this I've liked
what I look like and I will leave any
like if anything's different down below
in the description box and make sure to
check it out I will see you guys in my
next video
hi guys I thought I would update you
with how on my makeup wore I'm really
surprised at the foundation I thought it
would break down more it's almost 11
o'clock I did put this on about like 3
ish so how many hours is that it's like
almost 8 hours or so um I feel good
about the foundation it's not my
favorite it definitely still looks heavy
I don't know if you can see like just
around my pores and like my nose and I
did have glasses on so I tried to plug
that out the concealer did crease under
my eyes so that's not my favorite I
don't think they're like the worst
products ever I don't think they're the
best though I'm really happy with how
they controlled my oil most of all um
eyeliner still my number one absolutely
loved it it was really awesome and it
stayed on I really like how it wore in
the inner corner to highly suggest that
blood bomb still don't care about and
then the lip liner I put that on
underneath the other lipstick and I feel
I don't know if it's the color of
lipstick or if it was the lip liner but
my lips just felt really goopy like
there was just too much product on it
and it's kind of gooping up here
definitely could totally be the
colour-pop lippie stick I haven't worn
those a ton and they are I think that
one is a cream formula the one I use
Lumiere so I definitely could see it
being that I'm gonna definitely have to
test it out by itself like maybe with a
different eye look and let you guys know
how I feel about it so other than that
basically just get the eyeliner and the
foundation if you really really want to
try it other than that the other things
are just like okay they're not like
stand out products in any way okay
that's everything I hope you guys are
having a wonderful night I'm gonna take
off my makeup now go to bed
I'll see ya bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
