Lauren I was watching the video today by
Haila and if you don't know who she is I
will have her link down below definitely
go check her out she's super sweet super
cool she was talking about this Michael
Todd product that she bought and I was
thinking wow I haven't heard about
Michael Todd in a really really long
time and that got me thinking about all
the brand's we used to hear about on
YouTube and now we hear nothing about so
I just wanted to kind of like be
nostalgic and talk about some of the og
YouTube brands that used to be talked
about all the time I have five that I
want to talk about today but if there's
anything that you guys remember and I
don't mention it definitely leave it
down below I just feel like so many of
us have been watching YouTube for a
really long time and it's kind of funny
to see how things change and evolve it
was just definitely a different world
back then and different brands were
definitely at the forefront so the first
brand I want to talk about is Sigma
Sigma was it Sigma was what everyone
talked about everyone had like a 10% off
affiliate code for each month I just
remember every single month it'd be like
August 10 or whatever and that'd be 10%
off for that month everyone though had
an affiliate code for Sigma I know a lot
of people still use Sigma now I have
some Sigma brushes but by no means is it
nearly as popular as it was people were
using like the Sigma eyeshadow bases a
lot I remember Tiffany D camp on the
palette with them like I just feel like
they were they were basically what
Morpheus now back then it was all about
saving makeup it was all about Sigma
brushes and it's just interesting to see
how they're no longer really as popular
like nearly as popular so the next time
let's talk about Michael Todd because
that's what inspired this whole video I
remember so many youtubers talking about
Michael Todd and I remember Ingrid I
remember Fleur de fours
I remember Estee lalonde just so many
people would talk about like their blue
algae toner I think is something there's
like a pineapple enzyme mask I think
there's like a pumpkin mask too like I
just remember and everyone's like get
ready with me or skin care routine their
morning routines it always be featuring
more they'd always be using one of those
toners I saw it a lot of empties too so
I'm not saying they didn't use it up but
it was everywhere and I will say I saw a
video because I loved
watching videos like all about like
sponsorships and affiliates and all
these videos people make you know if you
get down the rabbit hole how that whole
thing goes but I didn't watch something
about someone who was offered to do
Michael Todd stuff but they had to agree
that they would give it a positive
review I'm not saying that any of those
people did that or signed up I have like
no proof it's just like this one memory
I have of watching someone talk about
that but I think that's interesting and
now you don't hear anything about them
I know Haila really loves the brush that
she got so I don't think that their
products are bad I have a blush from
them that I really like I don't know if
they make makeup anymore so I don't
think that their products are bad I
think it's really weird that they would
make people sign an agreement like that
but something interesting I think it's
very strange that no one talks about
them anymore like even what you just
don't like that toner anymore did you
move on to something new I know we all
go in phases but it was like everyone's
favorite and now what next brand let's
talk about whitening lightening slash
Gerard cosmetics okay I feel like I live
sir if violence you're like doing weird
stuff I don't know what's going on I
just put this on today for the first
time so hopefully not okay whining
lightning
I remember when everyone had the brow
bar to go I saw it all over the place I
remember wanting that product because
everyone had it it was like this YouTube
thing if you made YouTube videos more if
you watch them you always saw that brow
bar to go I don't even think I filled in
my eyebrows at this point I just wanted
it because like to me it represented
YouTube so like if I owned that that
would be like so crazy like this is
something I see all these other people
use I never bought it I've never bought
anything from lightening lightening
orderid cosmetics but that's like the
first thing I remember I believe they
had like their whole like whitening
teeth whitening stuff but then came the
lip glosses oh my the lip glosses that
were supposedly the best thing I ever
hit
Earth's I think it's hilarious because
why does no one - I mean okay I kind of
know I know it talks about them now
because the whole scandal and all that
with Carina kaboom which is absolutely
horrible but it's so weird I it really
does make me question like how many
people were making money and how many
people were just like saying they liked
it because everyone else liked it like
what was going on it's like this weird
Bermuda Triangle I feel like I talked
about but for me to triangle all the
time but it's just like this weird
vortex of craziness I feel like there
were initially people who maybe said
they were better than they were or were
enticed by money and it made them think
that it like they truly thought they
were better than they were because you
know it's like if they get money for it
maybe you're not maliciously like these
suck but I'm gonna make money maybe
you're just like these aren't bad like
these are pretty good and then everyone
in the hype and everything just like
creates this crazy whirlwind I don't
even know people actually like this
glasses work but glasses ever I have to
say I think the packaging was so tacky
with like the light that lit up in the
mirror on the side like who is in a club
like lighting their lip gloss I don't
know if I just like never go to the club
or what I was just like not into it and
I thought it was crazy that everyone was
so into it same with the lipsticks that
came out I really don't get it and I
will say - I'm not really into brands
that hike up their prices - then use a
coupon code like oh this probably cost
$100 but don't worry we'll give you a
75% off coupon and you'll get it for 25
it's like just putting out 25 like stop
trying to act like it's not worth 100 we
all know it's not worth 100 I just think
it's like a really weird marketing
tactic to me I feel like I can just like
see through it in a second so I don't
even know why they bother but yeah now
droid cosmetics I hear about it a little
bit I know they came out like this slay
all day or whatever
I also heard
like that they were trying to like do
like a metal matte palette kind of like
the Kat Von D and it was kind of like
shady ish I don't know I don't watch any
one who really shows their products so I
don't know if a lot of people decided
that these products weren't good or if
the scandal kind of made them like back
off and they didn't want to talk about
it because it's controversial or what
but I think it's interesting that
literally like Gerard cosmetics was
everywhere no one knows who the heck
Gerard cosmetics is outside of YouTube
but in the YouTube world it was like a
crazy crazy crazy crazy it's crazy
the fourth grade I wanted to mention was
Mac now Mac is obviously still talked
about we still like Mac but I'm telling
you Mac was everywhere I remember
everyone having their palettes in like
CD holders and it was the old packaging
that was like all black and they would
like put nail polish on the outside so
you knew what colors were in what
palette it was like the thing to have a
Mac palette even not like super
old-school but Mac Pro Longwear was like
the concealer everyone used Mac Pro
Longwear it was like Mac for a long
wearing like the Sigma f80 and stuff
like that and now it's like all about
the shape tape so I don't know where Mac
lost us as an audience I don't know if
it's priced I know they also changed
their cruelty-free status but I feel
like a lot of the bigger youtubers don't
talk about Mac nearly as much and a lot
of them aren't cruelty-free so I don't I
don't know if Mac just like lost its
charm or or what happened if these other
brands just kind of stepped it up I just
remember Mac blushes everyone was always
talking about Melba and all dressed
dressed up I don't really have that much
Mac self warm soul these are still like
classic products and people still like
them but they aren't talked about nearly
as much and the final brain I wanted to
talk about was first aid beauty I
remember it was like no one knew who
first aid beauty was and then all of a
sudden every single influencer like
really big influencer was talking about
their products their face wash their
night cream their eye cream any product
from them everyone's favorite oh they're
cleansing pads
I really haven't tried much from them I
did try a cleanser and it was just okay
I feel like it's definitely a show for
like how how much PR can really help
your brand
I think pure cosmetics is also really
big example of how sending out packages
really can help and be a great marketing
tactic because everyone was talking
about it whether or not it was like just
sent as PR or if it was like hey talked
about it and paid and sponsored in that
way it was everywhere and definitely got
their name on the map I don't hear about
basically anyone talking about them
anymore have this like specific memory I
don't know why I've like when this read
they have like a red clay mask that came
out and I just remember Ingrid talking
about it back when she was like Miss
Lynn Marazzi and did like beauty videos
really only and I just remember that
month is seeing that product in her
video and I remember being like I've
seen this now I'm like seven people's
favorite it's like okay not that it's
not a good product again it's just if
you pay attention you can definitely see
the pattern and see the marketing
strategies at work but anyway that's the
last one
I thought I would just I don't know I
thought it was fun to reminisce think
about the old days of YouTube it's just
definitely different now it's all about
morphe yeah we'll see we'll see how long
these brands hold on right maybe it'll
be forever maybe a new one will come up
and they'll go to the side who knows I
hope you guys enjoyed this let me know
in the comments down below what other
brands you remember hearing a ton about
and now you don't hear anything about I
would really love to hear about it I
know I just like thinking about this
tech stuff alright I'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
