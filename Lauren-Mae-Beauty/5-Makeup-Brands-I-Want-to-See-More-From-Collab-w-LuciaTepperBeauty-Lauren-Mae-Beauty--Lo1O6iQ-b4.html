Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm super excited because this is
a collab video I am collabing today with
Lucia Temper Beauty I'm gonna leave her
channel obviously link down below I
highly suggest her channel if you guys
like my content I know you will love her
her most popular series is something
called make up your mind which is a
series she started about make up topics
that she's made up her mind on and I
highly suggest that but I just love her
she is so well-spoken and articulate she
thinks about makeup critically and makes
you question why you buy things why you
like things and I think that's just
something needed so for the collab on
her channel she's talking about brands
that need to slow up on the releases
that release way too many products it's
just tiring and overdone and I am doing
five brands that I think should release
more products or new products or switch
it up we thought having both these
videos would be a nice balance and I
think overall for our channels that's
something that we want like as much as
we maybe will talk about negative things
when it comes to the makeup community I
think we overall just want to see
balance we're both passionate about
makeup we love makeup but we also want
to be realistic and have balance and I
think both of these videos will do it so
I highly suggest her channel please go
check it out guys and with that let's
get into the five brands that I think
should come out with new products or
should release more products for me when
I was coming up with these brands I
think a lot of these are brands that I
really enjoy and would love to see more
from obviously it's not like brands I
don't like and then one of them is just
like come on let's do this like please
do something else so the first brand I
have to talk about is makeup geek aunt I
love makeup geek I love their shadows I
think Marlena is such an inspirational
person I know she's recently gone
through a lot of stuff and I just can't
wait to see them get back on their
makeup game there was a time on YouTube
where makeup geek single shadows were
highly raved about talked about all the
time they were in everyone Z palettes
and then I think morphe just kind of
grew and people you know just decided
not to talk about them as much whether
that's because they didn't get sent PR
or weren't getting paid or I don't know
what what happened and why that kind of
fell off but I still love makeup geek
shadows now they have come out with
things more recently but I do think that
there
kind of gone up and I would love to see
them get back to maybe a bit of a lower
price point and I think that's going to
happen so I'm really excited to see what
she has coming I think there's like talk
and chatter that she might be going into
Ulta stores which Ulta is carrying so
many new brands I would not be surprised
if that's the case but I'm really
excited for the brand and the future of
her brand so I'm really hoping that she
comes out with just some bomb products
and just comes back to the market with
some really great new innovative ideas
just some solid quality products but
that's definitely a brand guy I just I
want to support and I want to like but I
need some new products the next brand
that I think should be coming out with
some new products not necessarily more
products just like newer lines of
products is benefit they're known for
their brows and they're known for their
blushes I think and then they have like
a million mascaras but like you
literally wear your eyeshadows like I
would love to see a palette from benefit
when it comes to eyeshadows they have
their cream shadows for a while and now
those are gone I would love to see them
expand not only their shade range in
foundations but just like expand some of
their products they feel like they're a
brand that constantly is repackaging
their old cult favorites or if they come
out with something new it's kind of
gimmicky and you know I just I don't
have a ton of things from benefit but I
love the rocket or blush that I have I
love my hoola light so I would just love
to see them come out and just have a
more overall well-rounded makeup line
and not just only rely on brow products
and then like repackaging brow products
or coming out with another mascara like
I feel like everyone used to love the
their real mascara and then the roller
lash everyone loves that so I don't know
why we need this new mascara like I
would love to see just actual new
products from them they don't have
liquid lipsticks like there's just so
much they're missing I feel like so it's
weird that they focused on just like
repackaging the blushes that they
already have or coming out with a new
shade of blush like please do something
that you don't already have alright so
the next brand on my list is Rimmel and
the reason I put them on the list is
because they're one of the few drugstore
brands and I feel like it's still really
affordable I feel like their prices are
still like good you know that
you don't have to spend $20 to get a
foundation or $17 and I'm putting them
on this list I'm not saying they don't
ever come out with new products I just
would like to have them have like some
new hit products or I don't know I just
feel like they were talked about more
before and now I just don't hear much
about them and I just love the price
point of them so much and I think that
they have had some really great hits
with me in the past so I would love to
see them just like have maybe a revamp
of packaging or just something something
fresh and new for me I don't know I just
don't want them to die out I feel like
they're dying out a little bit and I I
like them still I love their price point
and I really want to support them but
there's just nothing that's really
catching my eye so I wish they would
kind of like step something up I don't
know I just I want to love them more
than I do
and I think some new products would do
that for me I just really this is
actually six brands and not five so
sorry about that guys the one extra
bonus brand I guess the next company I
want to talk about is Sol de Janeiro and
I actually have a whole video talking
about Sol de Janeiro because this is one
of those brands that I just feel the
connection with why I don't know no
Brazilian but I freakin love their
products I think they're really great
they're really popular products are the
boom boom cream I love the lip butter
and that they have they just came out
with a hand cream but overall their line
consists a lot of like body care
products skin care products and I just
want to see them expand so much it's
just a brand I can get behind
I want to see sunscreens I want to see
body oils I want to see everything from
them like I want to see like tinted
moisturizers like I wanted to go there
with their brand so it maybe even like
tinted lip balms I think would be really
nice so I know though that they are
having a lot of new releases coming up
and so I'm really excited for that but
they're definitely a brand that I can't
wait to see more products from I'm
excited for their new launches and I
don't know I just I feel it with them
I'm excited they're very pricey but I
just something about them screams fun
and just great I love them the next
brand I want to talk about is Real
Techniques and this is actually started
by Sam and Nick from Pixie woo here on
YouTube I'm gonna leave their channel
link down below if you guys don't know
who they are but Real Techniques is a
brand
that mostly just encompasses brushes
they have some sponges it's like a
makeup tools and I know that they have
done palates in the past but I would
love for them to start getting into
makeup
I love the brushes that I've tried from
them I love that the brand is affordable
and I just think that makeup would be a
great addition to their line their
amazing makeup artist and I think they
can bring something really great to the
drugstore so I would love to see them do
eyeshadow palettes highlighters like the
whole shebang and just start releasing
actual makeup products you use with
their brushes I think that would be
amazing and the last bonus brand in
bricks is nude sticks and this is a
brand that I also just have a connection
way when I was working here in LA in a
beauty store we sold them and they came
in and trained us and I just
I enjoy the products I love the idea of
the line everything is in a stick form
and it cost $24 which is it pricey but I
just I like they're kind of cool girl
vibe really simplistic makeup but with
that I would love to see them expand
their line even more they have done more
than just like the lip and cheek pencils
and the eye pencils they have like some
bronzer sticks and highlighter sticks
now and they also came out with like a
roller eyeliner kind of similar to the
Mac one recently but I would love to
just see this continue and I would love
you to see their brand expand in general
maybe kind of like switch up the stick
thing like I know that's their brand and
I know that's like their stick hmm no
pun intended but I think that they are
well established enough brand now that
they can have a foundation and they can
have some other things even a stick
foundation will be so cool so I would
love to see new things from them it's a
brand I'm always excited when I've seen
new releases and I'm always interested
to check out reviews and whatnot so and
that's everything for the video guys
definitely leave down below what are
some brands that you have just a
connection to you for whatever reason
you don't know why or brands that you
wish would come out with new products or
would vamp up their line or change up
what they're doing I would love to know
and of course please go check out
Lucia's channel say hi to her and
definitely check out the companion video
to this I think it's gonna be great I
cannot wait to see it myself and that's
everything thank you so so much guys I
will see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
