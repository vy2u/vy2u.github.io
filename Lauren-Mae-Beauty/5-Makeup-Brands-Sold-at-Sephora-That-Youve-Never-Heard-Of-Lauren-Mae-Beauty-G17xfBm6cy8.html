learn thank you so much for watching
today I thought I would do a little bit
of a different video I was searching
through Sephora because I'm planning on
a different series on my channel and I
was coming across brands that I had
never heard of on site I've never heard
anyone review them I've never heard
anyone talk about them some of them are
new I'll give them that but I thought
this would be a fun idea to talk about
some brands that no one's really heard
of no one's reviewing no one's talking
about that are sold on Sephora because I
feel like a lot of these indie brands or
unknown brands are kind of you have to
kind of go out there and check a
different website or do a bunch of
different things but these are brands
that are on Sephora I would love to be
able to try some of these products out
in the future but they are kind of
pricey and I'm not rich so I thought I
would just bring these up let you guys
know about them show you some pictures
over to the side here and yeah let me
know if you've tried any of them I just
thought it'd be fun to bring a little
bit of awareness to these other brands
the first one I want to talk about is a
brand called stellar they have quite a
few different products all of the brands
that I chose to talk about today
actually have like multiple makeup items
it's not just like a concealer or
foundation and then the rest of skincare
they all are brands that have multiple
makeup items in their lines that are
being carried on Sephora
now I was going through and kind of
looking at the different products that
they have to offer and something that
kind of rank through for all of these
brands is that I feel like they are
definitely a bit more natural or
embracing more natural beauty that
doesn't mean they don't have coverage or
anything like that or they don't have
fun colors but there's just something
about them that's just simple and chic
it's not overly gaudy I don't you know
it's the exact opposite of two-phase to
give you an idea there are two products
that kind of piqued my interest the most
so the first one is the star dust lip
powder palette now I have to read that a
bunch of times because I was like lip
powder palette like we what what is this
so these cost $28 it comes in two
different colors and these are trio
powders that you can use on your lips
either alone in a more sheer kind of
shimmery look or on top of other
lipsticks to kind of change them up or
whatever
I think that's really interesting I've
never heard anything marketed
specifically as a powder before
obviously you could use eyeshadow I feel
like in place of that but I think it's
interesting that they came out with a
specific product for your lips tacit
powder so I was just kind of like what
is this and then the other product that
I was kind of intrigued by is the
limitless foundation this is a medium to
full coverage foundation it is a radiant
finish which I definitely been into more
luminous skin products just things that
are going to make the skin look the best
they can regardless of what type of skin
I have I I know a lot of you guys are
gonna be like what but I don't want to
just wear our matte foundations because
I'm oily I don't care anyway this has 22
different shades it retails for $38
which isn't the worst in price for a
foundations looking at the shade range I
love that there's 22 shades
but I don't know how deep it really
actually goes looking at the website I
mean it does go to a deep but I'm not
sure if it's deep enough to really cover
as many skin tones as it should but I
haven't seen it in person I just saw
from the pictures online
so that's stellar I'm excited they also
have like a really pretty like luminous
like primer or like radiance liquid
products but I thought looks really good
too and just their packaging is really
nice so let's move on to the next brand
the next brand is called antonin and
these products are all like certified
organic that's like a huge thing they're
all in like this really cool was
packaging it's mostly baked products and
the range that they have online it's
only like seven products or so so to me
the ones that I was most interested in
are the blushes you guys know I love the
Lord Gellar big blushes so of course I'm
probably going to want to try out these
ones they have three different shades in
the blushes two of them are met and then
one of them is a shimmer finish I think
that the rose color looks absolutely
stunning I love blushes in that shade I
love the packaging like everything about
it looks so beautiful the blushes do
retail for $36 though and that's part of
thing I'm like is it because these
products are just too pricy ain't no one
buying them or what now these are from
Sephora so you can kind of expect it
although now that Sephora is going to
carry color pop that's like super weird
to me so
um I don't know it makes it hard to
justify like that they only have like
high-end stuff does anyone else feel
like that anyway back to antonyms I
think because of the ingredients in the
packaging and just probably the fact
that it's just more luxury it's pretty
expensive but $36 is a pretty penny and
then next from them that I really liked
were the quads they have three different
quads obviously there's four shapes each
in them because it's a squad these we
sell for $39 and I thought that the
shade range of these was definitely
interesting there's one that's kind of
cool toned and like graves and stuff but
the other two have some kind of
different colors I really like the
selection for whatever reason it was
kind of giving me subculture vibes
obviously not exactly but if these are
actually pigmented I think they look
really really pretty as quads so I'm not
usually someone who reaches for that I
usually go for a singles or just give me
a big ol palette but those ones actually
looked interesting with their color
stories next let's talk about wander
Beauty this is probably the one that if
you've heard of any of these on this
list this is probably the one you've
heard of I know that Jacqueline Levine
here on YouTube she did test out like
the brow pencil and I think she really
liked it so that was something that I
was intrigued and wanted to try they
have three different colors in the
pencil it's a micro pencil very similar
to the Anasazi eyebrow was so I want to
try that product out and that retails
for $22 and then the next product I
wanted to try out and this one I can
actually potentially see myself
purchasing it's a kit of three separate
products it retails for thirty-six
dollars it has the glow get or miss in
it I've been really into setting sprays
for whatever reason lately and just mist
and stuff again with making the skin
look really fresh I just like it so it
has the glow bitter mist it has a beach
foam in the color sangria which if you
guys know anything about me you know I
don't really love lip products but I
love bones
I love tinted balms just really easy lip
products things you don't have to worry
about things that are hydrating on the
lips so that seemed exciting and then
the last product in there was a liquid
eye shadow and champagne which I'm not
necessarily a huge user of liquid eye
shadow but I love that the color is the
champagne color which is going to be
wearable for a lot of people so I
thought that
was like a really good deal that's
coming out to what a little under $12 a
piece for the product and you get to try
out a new brand a bunch of new products
I really love kids like that especially
if you're into panning you know that you
don't need full sizes of everything it
takes so long to get through some things
that minis
work perfectly fine and if you really
love it you can just repurchase it and
you're not wasting product and love sets
oh I love em next I have a brand called
Lila B and this is a very pretty brand
aesthetically it's super pleasing all
the packaging is white it almost looks
like a stone like a river rock or
something they have a lot of products in
compacts and they just look so cool I
would love to just like to touch it and
play with it because they just look so
pretty and calming and just just
something you would see like a blogger
have in a picture and in their like nice
little makeup bag that's what this looks
like gives me total blogger vibes so out
of the products on their page I I really
liked be a glow basement this retails
for $48 though it's so expensive again
I'm just like oh I want to try these
things out but that is so pricey I'm so
used to drugstore prices I think I'm
like buying a lot of color pop and yeah
mostly color pop lately and even so I
just bought the subculture palette
that's $40 for a bunch of shadows
whereas this is one product in 48
dollars and the other products that I
wanted to try always be be kissed
lip balm again it's in that really cool
packaging so mostly I want to try it for
that it retails for $34 the only thing I
can see myself really not liking about
it is that it is in a pot format so it's
definitely something you'd want to use
by the side of your bed or in your home
not something on the go not something
you would throw in your purse because
it's just going to get kind of nasty and
not stay sanitary and the last one I
wanted to talk about is Ilya and I've
been looking at a product from them for
a really long time when I made my big
Sephora haul always it link down below
if you haven't tested out but when I did
that haul this was in red asket for a
long time and I just moved it out
because I wanted other things over it
but it's the cucumber water stick it
retails for $42 and
no I'll just talked about so I don't
know I really want to try it I want to
see if it's actually moisturizing if it
just like sinks into the skin and just
preps the skin and plumps it that's what
I'm hoping it'll do plus it it feels
like cucumber it probably just smells so
refreshing and nice so I really want to
try that product out and then the next
product I want to try out our lip balms
one two lip balm and one two lip scrub
technically so they have the balmy days
and that is the actual lip balm it's in
a normal like roll up packaging kind of
like the fresh ones and then they have
the balmy nights which is a sugar scrub
in a tube form so I don't know those I
just love lip balms you guys know I
don't know what it is but other people
have the liquid lipsticks and I got the
lip balms okay I love them and that
retailed for $26 so those are things
that I really want to try out I'm just
kind of bringing attention to some new
brands I know Sephora is bringing a lot
of stuff in lately we have like pretty
vulgar and milk which got a ton of
attention and I know milk does a lot of
PR but pretty vulgar doesn't and they
were all over the place so I don't know
why these brands don't get more love I
really would like to see some reviews on
these hopefully I can try to review some
of them myself coming up soon we'll see
let me know what you guys think is
interesting if you guys have heard of
any of these brands or anything down
below I would love to know and that's
everything thank you so much for
watching guys I'll see you my next one
