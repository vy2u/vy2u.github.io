Lauren thank you so much for watching I
was sitting down and looking at all of
the controversy around the Kylie
cosmetics brush set that's gonna be
three hundred and sixty dollars and I
decided to find some items and find
things that I could buy for the same
exact price as the brush set now I know
this has gotten a ton of flack I know
that there are a ton of people who feel
really passionately about this either
way it's sometimes nice to get
perspective on what else you could buy
now I know a lot of people have said
they don't want to buy these brushes
because they are so expensive that it's
a ridiculous price and you know I would
have to agree with that but Kylie can
charge as much as she wants for whatever
she wants to that's her prerogative she
can do whatever she wants it's our
choice as consumers to purchase them or
not but I thought it would still be fun
to go through and talk about the things
that I personally could buy instead of
the brushes that either it's going to be
the same exact price or even cheaper
just definitely put it in perspective to
me and you don't even have to take these
as just the Kylie cosmetics brush just
think about any big makeup order you've
purchased lately anything in the 300
dollar range you could do the same thing
to that so it's not even necessarily
just through Kylie I think it just is
like a hot topic right now since it is
for one item it just like blows your
mind but think of how much money we
spend all the time on makeup and imagine
what else you could buy with that makeup
because our lives are not just makeup as
much as we love it I just think it's
important to have balance and that's
what I try to bring to the YouTube
community with my channel so I'm gonna
talk about some things I'm not trying to
be mean I might be a little sassy but
it's different it's all good fun let me
know what your thoughts are on the
brushes down below though because I
would definitely like to know what you
think and I want to point out that I'm
not gonna be mentioning like paying your
bills and doing all this other stuff
because I'm assuming if you have this
money to potentially consider the Kylie
cosmetics brushes that you're not using
your bill money you're using like extra
money you have so these are all fun
extra things you could do in your life
instead of getting that set that maybe
would bring you just as much joy maybe a
little bit more joy I don't know I don't
know what your personality is like so
anyway let's get into it
enough of that so immediately the first
thing I did was look up tickets to
Disneyland because I love Disneyland for
a one-day pass to Disneyland a park
hopper one so you can go into Disneyland
or California Adventure back
as much as you want it's a hundred and
twenty four dollars a person at the most
peak time so that's like if I went
tomorrow because it's Christmas so for
us to each have a day pass to get into
Disneyland it would be about two hundred
and fifty dollars and then we would
still have money left over to buy food
we could get souvenirs we could get some
churros we could just have a good time
make a whole day out of it it makes some
awesome memories for the day I think
that would be so much fun
I also decided to break it down because
it's like okay that's one day and this
brush that's gonna last you forever
hopefully if you're spending that much
money and it's really good quality but
if I wanted to break it down a different
way I could also for me because I do
live in California I could get the
Southern California select passport
which is like a year long season pass to
Disneyland for three hundred and thirty
nine dollars so cheaper than the brush
set guys
I'm not crazy it's so crazy for me
putting stuff into perspective like this
I'm just like oh wait how much should I
just spend on makeup that's sitting in
my drawer and I'm gonna declutter later
I know brushes are a little bit
different but still guys number two you
could get an iPad what what you know
it's kind of crazy to think of like
technology being cheaper than these
brushes but yeah it's only 32 gigs it's
not like the one with a ton for three
hundred and twenty nine dollars so if
you wanted to if you just had the money
laying around and maybe you needed to
upgrade an electronic maybe you could do
that instead
just a thought if you can't tell I tried
to think of things that to me in my head
I'm like oh that's expensive or oh they
must have money that make me feel like
oh I could never afford that or I can't
afford that
so I just thought I'd put it into even
more perspective this I thought would be
kind of fun I know Tiffany &amp;amp; Co is a
super popular brand or it used to be
like I remember on YouTube when everyone
had like the Tiffany necklace so if you
wanted to you and a best friend could
each get the heart tag pendant necklace
from Tiffany and Co are there are a
hundred and fifty dollars you could have
a matching pair and you have a little
leftover money to go get lunch or
something how fun would that be creative
memory with your best friend share your
love with a little heart necklace look
Fuji while doing it how fun number four
I decided to try to look at like
expensive bags so I always hear people
talking about Coach bags people standing
in line during like Black Friday to get
a
great coach bagg on an amazing deal and
so I decided to check out the website
and my gosh they are still expensive let
me tell you if you really want like the
cutest bag probably the one you want the
most you'll need to get to Kylie brush
so that's for one bag it's still
expensive but I did find some that I
thought were really cute and the one you
can get for cheaper than the Kylie brush
kit is the turnlock tote from Coach it
comes in seven colors it's $295 and some
of the colors are on sale for a hundred
and seventy seven for the holiday so
kind of like a bargain there you're
gonna have this purse forever you can
carry everything with it you're gonna
love it if you've never treated yourself
to a bag before but always wish you
could but you buy a ton of makeup you
could buy a bag instead or at least
maybe get a down payment for a really
really expensive and the last thing here
it's a hot air balloon trip oh my gosh
of you guys ever wanted to do something
like that
I know I do I'm a little bit scared but
I kind of want to try it out so I was
looking at hot air balloon sites around
me and the prices for rides so they
change it for weekends and weekdays so
on weekdays it is a hundred and forty
eight dollars per person so if there
were two of you it would be two hundred
and ninety six dollars for you to have
an amazing experience up in air
something you'll never forget something
that's maybe on your bucket list how
cool would that be
but if you wanted to go for the weekend
and you want to just lurch a little bit
more it would be a hundred and seventy
eight per person or three hundred and
fifty six dollars which still puts you
four dollars under again this is just
supposed to be fun guys I wanted to just
put into perspective for myself and then
as I was doing that I was like this
would be a really good video topic and I
thought you guys would enjoy it I know
from experience that the beauty
community can just make you buy buy buy
and want want want and although a lot of
influencers have stood up and spoke out
about the Kylie cosmetics products that
are coming out the brush set the
concealers and whatnot they're standing
up against Kylie but there are so many
other things like I mentioned it's
different because this is like one
product I guess for a lot of money but
if we think about all of the products
across the board that are constantly
being talked about and pushed and
released I mean it easily adds up to way
more than three hundred and sixty
dollars like a week that we're being
shown so you can definitely apply this
to more than just the Kylie brushes it's
interesting to look at your money where
you're spending it
you actually want to spend it there and
if you do that's amazing I'm happy for
you you go for it but if it isn't if you
if you don't realize like oh like how I
am spending a lot of money where I'd
rather be doing those things it's
sometimes nice to have something to kind
of just like oh yeah put you in check
and you know help you remember that
there are other things in life besides
beauty guys we love the makeup but we
also love living our lives so I hope
this was fun I hope you enjoyed it let
me know your thoughts down below in the
comments and I will see you in the next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
