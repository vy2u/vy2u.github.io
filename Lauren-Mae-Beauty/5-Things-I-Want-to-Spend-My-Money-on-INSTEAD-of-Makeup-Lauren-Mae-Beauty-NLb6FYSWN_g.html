Lauren thank you so much for watching um
just so you know if you want a tutorial
on this look I did a palette bingo so
I'm gonna leave that link down below but
today I wanted to just chat with you
guys about some of the things I want to
buy instead of makeup this year now
don't get me wrong I'm still gonna buy
makeup but something that I like to do
on my channel is have balance and just
in my life and I've found that most the
time when I get any extra money
I immediately spend it all on makeup and
that's something I kind of want to
change I want to have other things in my
life besides makeup I love makeup and
I'll always love makeup but I don't need
to spend every last extra penny that I
have on new highlighters and blushes
when I already have a ton of my
collection so these are five things that
I want to buy more of this year instead
of putting those funds toward makeup so
yeah we'll just get into it the first
thing that I want to put my money toward
is art now I'm not talking about like
super expensive art pieces
I just want to support artists that I
follow on Instagram I like a lot of cool
artists I'm gonna leave a link down
below if you want to check them out I
really want to buy some of those pieces
with my new background that I'm setting
up I want to be able to feature some of
that art and I just want to support
artists in what they're doing I think
it's so cool I admire it so much on
Instagram and I don't know why I can't
spend 40 or 20 dollars on a print when I
easily spend $60 on a palette so that's
one of the things I want to try to buy
more of this year it's just art and
things I love and help support other
people who are trying to make their
living and doing their crafts I think
that's amazing and I want to be a part
of supporting that the next thing that I
want to buy our pins I'm talking about
like little enamel pins I definitely am
a collector at heart I just enjoy
collecting things and having collections
of things and I don't want this to go to
like crazy out of control but I love
pins I think they're so pretty I've seen
so many beautiful pins on Etsy and again
this is kind of in a vein of like
supporting artists who are creating
these things
me and Sam also have quite a few pins
from Disneyland and we've completed a
couple collections so they don't like
need to go in our lanyard anymore when
we go to Disneyland instead like we can
just keep them at the house so I'm gonna
be doing like a DIY banner thing
I don't think I'm gonna film it unless
you guys really want to see it but it's
just gonna be a way for me to be able to
kind of like display my pins in a better
way so that way they can kind of be an
art piece and they're not just like in a
box or I don't know and a little like CD
case thing so I wanted to show you guys
these ones though just to give you an
example I got these from Sephora it was
so cool these were like 250 points I
think and they're so cute this is like a
little makeup set this is a unicorn with
like a Sephora horn we have a little
peace sign with Sephora nails and just
some hearts so just an example these are
the type of pins I'm talking about those
are something that I think are so cute
and so fun and I want to buy so bad but
I feel kind of silly and I'm like that's
stupid I'm not gonna feel silly I'm
gonna just like let myself be myself and
not feel ashamed the next item on my
list is clothing and this is something I
always neglect for myself one I plus
size which is like harder to find
clothes and I enjoy makeup it always
fits it always makes me feel good where
sometimes when you try and close you can
feel not cute not good but with this
year I'm working on becoming healthier
when it comes to my mind and my body so
hopefully I can you know lose a little
weight feel a little bit more confident
in some newer clothes I also feel like
I'm finally at a place where I know my
style and I'm done trying to act like I
need color in my clothes because I don't
wear color on the clothes I wear color
on my eyes I love pink in my hair but
when it comes to my clothing I love
neutrals I love black and that's what I
feel confident in that's what I always
wear no matter if I buy a bunch of
shirts I will wear the black one over
and over and over and over so I'm just
gonna embrace that it's a stylistic
choice and not boring I just know what I
like so I definitely want to just invest
in some clothing instead of just buy
makeup and hopefully I can get some nice
outfits not wear the same shirt every
freaking day of my life and feel more
confident when I have to go out or be in
public situations where I need to look
nicer because most my clothes are pretty
like athleisure or like I don't know
chill the next thing I want to buy more
of this year are tickets and this can
mean tickets in so many ways so
comes to movies I want to go to the
movies more and spend my money there me
and Sam have tickets to Hamilton in
Arizona in February which I'm really
excited about so that's another way
buying tickets to plays or comedy shows
I think those would be really fun and
like more the experience we're also
going to be buying plane tickets later
this year because we're going to Italy
in the summer so just focusing on the
experience of tickets concert tickets
like anything like that I think would be
really cool and ultimately I think I
would have a better experience in memory
with those items instead of buying
makeup and the last way I want to spend
my money this year is by buying gifts
more for other people and this doesn't
have to be lavish and extravagant it
could just be like a little thing here a
little thing there if I think of
something sending it to someone I love
getting gifts and I love giving gifts
and I want to do more of that if I have
some extra money I want to think of
other people and yeah I think that will
feel really rewarding and ultimately
make me feel better than just buying
more things for myself so that's another
way that I want to take maybe some of
those extra funds I would have spent on
makeup and spend it on other people
maybe I can just like buy makeup for
other people that could kind of get both
of them done right mmm anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this idea this is kind of
similar to the idea of like what you
could buy when it comes to the Kylie
brushes like what that money could go
toward instead of those I just decided
to write down a list and I thought well
I might as well film that like guys no I
think it's just a good reminder with
everything else that like it's a fee to
buy other things we all love makeup but
you don't always have to spend all your
extra money on makeup and sometimes it
feels better to not even if you have
this pressure if you let it pass you can
buy other things and it's exciting you
know it's exciting to have other things
in your life you also could just save
your money that's a great way but I'm
just thinking about other things that I
can spend the extra money that I have on
anyway that's everything thank you so so
much for watching let me know what you
want to spend your extra money on in the
comments and I will see you in the next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
