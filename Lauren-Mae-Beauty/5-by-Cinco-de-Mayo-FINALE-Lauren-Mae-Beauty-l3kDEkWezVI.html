it's Lauren thanks so much for tuning in
I just want to say really fast that
thanks for all the new subscribers
thanks for all the old subscribers this
one to say welcome and hi I feel you
have to talk to you guys in so so long I
had a couple of like kids that were
coming up so I made sure to pre-fill and
it just took me a long time to get those
up so it feels like forever since I've
actually like had a video that I filmed
and then went up relatively soon i also
got sick again which I never get sick so
it's just so frustrating to be sick
twice in like two or three months we'll
just get into the videos i'm gonna try
to space them out and not film
everything today we'll see how that go
who's you guys know I love to film a lot
of videos at once so I can that place so
wow you guys know I like to found a lot
of videos at once just so I can just get
as much content out for you as possible
I apologize for not being as consistent
in the last like week or two weeks or so
but hopefully I can get back on track
have a video about every other day or
every day it depends and then also I am
in a new background I just decided to
film on my couch like I just wasn't
feeling super great and I was like I
want to sit on my couch and film so
that's our mat on my couch you guys
can't see me like moving my arms out but
I'm just sitting on my couch thought
it'd be nice just a little more relaxing
and haven't had that much motivation to
fill lately so it's just nice to film in
a more comfortable location I don't know
I might continue to film here I'm kind
of gonna do whatever I want to coming up
because I need all the energy i can get
and if i have even the slightest bit of
energy to do something then I just need
to like go for it and that's just the
state of mind I'm in lately I'm not
gonna go into details on that if you we
can have a let's talk video if you want
but yeah okay let's get into my finish
five by Cinco de Mayo finale and I'm
sorry it's late but let's do it so I
picked five items and I feel like I
picked him pretty early on in the year
because I really wanted to tackle some
larger items in my collection so I feel
really good I know I feel like we're all
in same boat with how we did on our
projects we did a good job but I don't
know I just because it's only five items
wanted to like hit all of them but I did
it but I still feel really really happy
with what I did so i'll stop rambling
let's get into it you guys already know
about my smashbox blue eyes palette I
did hit pan and the shade custard if I
can find a picture i'll leave it in here
now
but I did hit pan on that but I did end
up giving that palette away because I do
not like the eyeshadows in there I think
they're just overall just crappy if
we're just being blunt so I got rid of
that palette I didn't want to keep it
just to like Chopin for the rest of the
year in it so it's gone out of my
collection but I did hit pan on it so
that one was a success all right we'll
start off with all the items I finished
I did finish um quite a bit i mean
honestly i did a great job i just i
wanted that hundred percent satisfaction
and so that's just who i am as a person
like it's like all or nothing always so
yeah I'm like a little intense so anyway
this is my Revlon Colorstay whipped in
the color ivorie 110 boom baby it's done
so happy that I finish this up it's so
funny because I complained so much about
this product and then in the end I felt
like I really liked the combination and
so when I finish it I'm like crap what
am I gonna do now like I was getting
used to that combination so now to find
a new combination of products that I
like and that just takes time it's just
nice to have like a flawless face
routine or whatever that you really like
and I was really enjoying using this and
mixing it with a darker BB cream so it
was a way for me to kind of cut the
consistency of this and make it not as
light it was a little too light for me
which never happens like nothing's ever
too late for me but this one was there
it is again just so again whole basket
in the blurry but i'm really glad this
is done i would not repurchase this it's
not something i really enjoyed but i am
glad that i finished up this whole thing
because i bought this because it just
came out and all the hype and i'm just
glad i got my money's worth out of it
the next I knew I finished here is the
bourgeois bronzing primer and oh my gosh
I finished this onto I'm so happy I
actually missed this product I got so
used to using this every single day as
like a cream contour so I do miss this I
definitely would consider repurchasing
this in the future something I really
liked about this is I could kind of go
heavy-handed with it and it just blended
out so nice this isn't like densely
pigmented it's kind of like a bra like
it's as a bronzing primer so it's like
yeah it just kind of shears out really
nicely it's not really dense pigment
exactly what I just said it's just easy
I feel like it's foolproof you could use
less of it and then just get even like
Oh a more light look or you could use as
much as
did and kind of still gonna have your
look but it still looks really nice and
blended so definitely I think I would
repurchase this I kind of again i miss
it it just kind of gave me a really nice
sculpted look it smelt nice to kind of
was chocolate II I mean it didn't like
chocolate to me it smells like the
bourgeois chocolate bronzer if you ever
had that that's what it smelled like but
um yeah that one's gone boo now this is
the lip gloss I figure look less in here
you guys know how hard it is for me to
use lip glosses i will insert clips of
this so you guys can see but it is so
used up there is like no product i did
take the stopper out of this as well so
there's no stopper i mean i can
technically like swirl this in there and
like i could probably get five more
applications or something but for all
purposes of this project i'm calling it
quits I haven't decided if I'm just
gonna like put it on my lips five more
times and then call it quits cuz again
although I know a lot of you guys are
gonna be like it's done call it done
girl like stop freaking out about this
it's over but because there's
technically so product in there I'm like
still tempted to use it which is like
kind of crazy I know but yeah I'm
counting it done for the project I feel
super happy and successful started it
here so it had like half the product
left and I i feel like i can say with
confidence that I completely use this
one out and the last item here this is
the Stila one-step prime color this is
Anna color kitten and I didn't start
here I starting on the line my gosh my
voice seriously like I keep trying to
clear my throat not working I started on
the second line down on this one and
then now I am like all the way here and
it's not even like I'm all the way there
I just push this down like I have to
like really wiggle this to get it out
because it's just getting really hard at
the bottom here so I'm super happy with
the progress I made on this again it's
not completely done and I probably could
do like maybe a week and a half or two
weeks worth of you slept on this so I do
still think of this as like a success in
my mind but technically it's not
finished this is one of the items I want
to use up by the end of the year so I'm
really happy to get this out I've had to
layer this with other primers so it
definitely took a little bit of work to
use but it does give a really nice
luminous finish on the skin I do enjoy
it I wouldn't repurchase it but I do
hate using this it just was like an
extra step and sometimes I was just lazy
so those are all my items for my
finished by of my Cinco de Mayo finale
I'm super happy with my progress and I'm
in a finish six by summer plus a couple
other items fourth of July type of thing
going on but I am going to be doing
another project pan after this I'm going
to be doing a project pan roulette and
I'm going to be making it the 13 by
october or halloween third finished 13
by halloween i did that one last year
tatum started it I don't know if she
still makes videos I haven't seen
anything uploaded from her in a long
time but I did that challenge last year
and I thought if I started kind of early
I can make it like a project pan
roulette through lots are really fun
Heather Warren started rillettes and
then I did want and I kind of blew up so
yeah I kind of want to do roulette again
like kind of want to do something a
little more challenging a little more
fun and if I give myself that time all
the way to Halloween I feel like I could
actually on top of like it being a fun
idea actually like be executed well so
um anyway let me know if you guys think
that's a good idea I will see you guys
in my next video and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
