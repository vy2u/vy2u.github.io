Lauren this is a super exciting video
because I just wanted to say thank you
so so much for 5000 subscribers I can't
believe it still I've been on YouTube
for about a year and a half now I
started at the end of februari of 2015 I
believe ya 2015 I was right when I moved
to California with my husband from
Arizona and there was something I'd
wanted to do for a really really long
time and I was watching a ton of videos
a lot of people in the project panning
community I finally with the move just
got my courage to actually film videos
and edit them and and upload them so um
it's just super exciting to be at 5,000
subscribers so early I feel like as much
as compared to so many of the people
5,000 may seem like nothing if you put
5,000 people in a room or say you had to
mail 5,000 invitations to someone that
is so many people and it's crazy to
think that that many people have decided
to watch my videos not only that but
then decide to be like yeah I want to
see her videos more I'm gonna subscribe
I just wanted to thank you so much for
all the love and support it's just
mind-blowing and you don't know how
grateful and just exciting this is for
me and I just wanted to thank you I
thought it would use a video as an
opportunity to bring up a couple ideas
they had for other videos as well as
just different things kind of yeah like
just a talking point not quite an update
but just like a fun way to talk so a few
things to talk about I wanted to know if
you guys would want to see a QA I told
myself that I wouldn't do a Q&amp;amp;A until I
had at least 5,000 subscribers because
something about it weirds me out like no
one's gonna care and have any questions
to ask you so now that I feel like I
have a decent amount of people who might
possibly be interested if you're not I
don't know it's still kind of weird but
if you do have any questions for me and
you want me to do a Q&amp;amp;A video definitely
leave any questions down below in the
video and if I get enough or if there's
like a positive response to that then I
definitely will shoot a Q&amp;amp;A video for
you guys I think that would be fun
another thing too I know a lot of people
do giveaways when the hit certain amount
and I did want to do a 5,000 subscriber
giveaway I think I've mentioned it
before but I am NOT a giveaway person
like when people do giveaways I don't
even cut like I'm not commentary I never
counted on videos before i started
making chant like before I made my
channel I just was like this silent
creeper watching videos and like that's
just how I am I didn't even like videos
before i'm telling you i just watched
that's anyway so um when giveaways
happen i never enter them or do any of
that to like in my head it's just not a
part of YouTube for me but I know so
many other people do really like
giveaways and I got it be fun to give
away some of like my favorite things
I've talked about here on my channel and
just give you guys some of like my
favorite products for my giveaway so
again if you're interested in that just
let me know that down below as well I
just want to just get a read off of you
guys if that would be something that you
guys would be interested in if you guys
like giveaways and I think it'd be fun
to share the love back to you guys what
else what else what else you guys know
I've been insanely busy like it's just
been a crazy time it's super exciting I
feel really blessed and fortunate and
then with my youtube channel growing
steadily with it I just want to thank
you too for like staying in there i know
i was uploading so consistently for the
longest time because i didn't have a job
at just was doing school and then it was
kind of slow and so I was able to focus
a lot of time on my youtube and i still
really want to focus on my youtube and
make videos and keep them consistent I
don't think I'm gonna be able to do them
like every single day like I was it's
just not possible at least right now
we'll see with freelancing and doing
gigs obviously it's you know it's not
like a normal job so sometimes there's
downtime sometimes there isn't so I'm
going to try my best to kind of work out
a schedule and get organized and keep my
youtube consistent even when other work
isn't or whatever thank you for sticking
with me through that but couple other
ideas I had four videos I kind of wanted
to do a like YouTube shoutout
video like talk about my favorite
YouTube channels not only people in the
project panning community but just other
channels that i watch regularly I kind
of feel I go back and forth on it
because it's like I don't anyone to feel
like hurt if I don't mention them but I
also and I don't want to feel pressure
to mention people just because I feel
bad to not mention them but i also want
to really shout out the people that I
think are amazing and that I really like
watching and that I don't feel like have
nearly as many subscribers as they
should and especially people that I've
never mentioned on my channel before and
just people that I like I genuinely
watch every video because I like them
and not just because I'm really
interested in this video or that video
but I don't want it to be taken in a bad
way it's not like hurtful it's just to
be positive for those people and it's
not meant to be negative toward the
other people not mentioned but anyway if
you guys want to see something like that
definitely let me know I just thought
that'd be fun to kind of share the love
and also just let you guys know who I
like watching whether they're bigger or
smaller I can even do them in like once
a month like do five people it doesn't
have to be just like a finite video
where it's just a one-time thing but
that was something I was thinking about
I was also thinking about doing
potentially not that I like some big
youtuber or something but just unlike
tips and tricks on different things that
I find helpful or things that I find
like not irritating just like kind of
more a series on just different aspects
of YouTube like commenting and you know
subscribers and editing and lighting and
tips and tricks or just whatever
anything you guys might want to see if
you have any suggestions for that or
want to see something like that
definitely back down below as well oh my
gosh it's like a lot I know um I just I
feel like I haven't talked to you guys
in so so long if you feel like you
haven't seen me it's because you haven't
but definitely check out my instagram
i'm trying to stay more consistent with
that when I'm not on YouTube to kind of
like counteract the absence here i'll
try to post videos of what i'm doing in
my like not my real life because that
sounds like I'm fake on here but you
know what I'm saying like when I'm out
doing stuff and can't post videos or
can't record videos I was also thinking
about potentially
to do some vlog stuff okay I was
thinking about doing a video honestly
I've like all the things I said I was
gonna do and haven't I just listed the
hell is just like a thing because I've
seriously I have a vlog video of Vegas
that I've never uploaded and it's I
think mostly edited it's super short
because it's super awkward to vlog like
have you guys ever blogged before it's
weird to me I mean I think a Q&amp;amp;A is kind
of weird so imagine me it's like
vlogging myself it's kind of freaky so I
do have some vlog footage in Vegas still
which i'll probably upload at some point
if you guys see that let me know I also
still have footage from Peru I've logged
there so i might do something with that
but i was thinking about doing some
vlogs like when I'm on set and just
different things like that to kind of
like show you guys what I'm doing when
I'm not here and I don't know I just
thought that would be kind of cool and
maybe try to show you some of the stuff
that I've been doing I don't know maybe
like a weekly vlog I can't really stick
to a schedule though and tell you it'll
be once a week or anything though I just
don't want to make promises I can't keep
I think that's everything for this video
I don't know this is mostly just like a
thank you again thank you thank you so
much I'm just it's very exciting I never
thought when I got on here I mean I
hoped let's be honest I think that's
something to that I want to talk about
my youtube video but in like the youtube
series is that obviously I hoped I would
get subscribers like it's not like let's
be real it's like you don't come on here
hoping no one to watch your videos and
like you'll have two views every video
obviously you hope that people will
watch it and enjoy it and like it but I
I didn't I don't know it's just exciting
that it has happened and it's gone that
way and that it only took a year and a
half to get to 5,000 I think you know
that's a big accomplishment I feel like
starting from zero and going up to that
much especially because I don't really
self promo like I don't tell anyone
really in my real life I have started a
little bit more now because I just feel
like it's more established and it
doesn't look you know people were like
I'm a huge
oh yeah YouTube and it's like I'm not
saying that their work doesn't mean as
much or that they don't put a lot of
time into the videos what I'm just
saying I don't like saying that if it's
not necessarily successful I would maybe
more talk to someone about that when I
know them better or we get into a deeper
conversation but I'm not just like
promoting it that way I never have and
even now I still don't I'm still more
quiet about it but it's just so crazy
that it it's you know it's bigger and
hopefully continues to grow so anyway I
think I'm going to end this video here
definitely leave comments suggestions
any answers to any questions I posed in
this video down below and then I'm gonna
film a couple more videos today
hopefully I can get them up soon yeah I
just once again thank you guys so much
for all the kind words oh shoot one more
thing gosh i knew i was gonna forget one
thing another thing i wanted to just
mention in this video to I wanted to say
thank you because I've gotten two nasty
comments and just recently which
obviously no one likes to get those
comments but you just have to let them
let them go you know but i don't do i I
don't delete those comments because I
just think like that's real life like
someone said that to me unless it's
super hurtful i have never gotten
anything that's like a death threat or
something absolutely horrible and
obviously however you want to handle
your comments section I totally support
however someone wants to do that if they
want to block someone or delete the
comment or whatever but for the nasty
ones i've got i've never felt the need
to delete them and i don't want you guys
to think that as much as i get a lot of
love it that's just real life like
people say that type of stuff and I
don't respond to those because it's just
it's fueling the fire I've dealt with
people in real life who are like this
and whether they're trolling to just
troll or really feel that way and just
want to like get in a fight it's just
like not worth it so as my chair
all is growing I only I only expect to
get more comments like that I want to
say thank you for a couple people that
have stood up for me in the comments I
really do appreciate that you don't have
to do that and it's very sweet of you
but I also don't want you guys to get
offended by those comments either i want
you guys to as much as you can like let
it go shake it off I don't want you guys
to then get into a fight in the comments
section I did have to like delete it
just because it was just getting so
nasty and I just felt so horrible I
didn't know what to do so she's like I'm
just gonna delete the whole thread cuz
it just feels really I get just a key I
didn't like you know I just didn't want
that on here so thank you so much for
standing up for me I appreciate it and
that's so sweet of you but like let's
just like not acknowledge the haters
let's just not acknowledge them like
they can hate people are gonna hate it's
gonna happen and I feel like as as
anyone's channel grows they see more
like outsiders coming in that haven't
been a part of the community as long as
other people or you know just the bigger
get the more randos can kind of like
find your channel and you know it's just
it's gonna happen so I just don't want
us to get sucked into that negativity
either so I just wanted to like a dress
that which is really really fast and say
thank you mostly it's like standing up
for me cuz it's just very sweet of you
to like go in there and stand up for me
and just like any other person but I
don't want anything to get negative i
don't want you to get verbally abuse
either online like it's just uh it's
just so silly it's really just stupid
that people do that stuff so anyway I
think that's the actual end of this
video again thank you so much the
seventeen hundred millionth time I'm
gonna say that and I will see you guys
in my next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
