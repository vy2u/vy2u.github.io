a wonderful day this is going to be my
finish sixth sense by summer finale i'm
posting this just a little late but let
me show you guys what I've used I
haven't really used any of this stuff
after the 21st which was the first day
of summer because yeah I wanted to try
to keep it as close to an actual
deadline as I possibly could I did use
the spray in here just because out of
like I needed to spray myself I wasn't
gonna smell bad just because I didn't
want to use the product and then be like
five sprays after the deadline if that
makes sense so hopefully that's okay
with you guys let's get into this for
those of you who weren't here from the
beginning this project was started by
the button minimalist i will link her
channel down below and your goal was
basically just trying to use up some of
the sent items in your house in your
household so that you could try to clear
some things out it was a fun little
project now I kind of did my own version
of it and I decided to pick instead of
just six items I picked six categories
and then a specific amount of items
after that so let's get into the first
category and hopefully you know you'll
see how I did it so the first category I
had were candle picked four candles out
of my stash of candles and I ended up
getting to use three of those candles up
and almost the fourth one so one of the
first candles that I used up was this
woodwick one this one is in the color or
in the color this one is innocent and
vine and it was nice it smelt pretty
nice I didn't think that it smelled my
house up very well so I don't know if I
purchases again but I did get this at TJ
maxx and it's done another one that I
used up was copacabana beach by bath and
body works i absolutely love this son it
smells so divine i loved it so much the
entire time eyes burning it i want to
get some more I still haven't I say that
every freakin video but I really need to
get some more of these before they go
away for summer and it's just a great
one but that one's sadly finished
another bath and bodyworks candle this
is pomelo grapefruit this one's felt
really nice is very fresh citrusy scent
it's all gone this was the last one I
used up and then the next one is the
I was working on I thought in my last
update that I'd get done with this but I
did not so i got about like over halfway
done that's what it looks like inside I
honestly just haven't been home to burn
candles for like long amounts of time
but I'm gonna keep burning this i'll be
through with this pretty dang soon but
technically it didn't get finished in
the deadline so i was three out of four
on that one which i think it's pretty
good those are a really bulky item so
it's nice to get three of them out of my
collection and i can repurpose them or
you know send them to the goodwill or
something like that so other people can
use them and they're not taking up space
Oh a little disclaimer my eyebrows are
purple and also if I have like a purple
ring around my face I was just at school
and I did a makeup look that I was a
unicorn in so um yeah I decided to
embrace the purple browse when I got
home too because they were kind of died
they stained because i use the Urban
Decay electric palette so my eyebrows
were stained pink and I just thought it
kind of just brings a little bit of edge
to my look it's still kind of subtle and
i also have purple streaks in my hair
too that's why if my hair looks
different too that's why a little late
into the video on that one but alright
the next category was for brees now this
is my fur breeze here and i really
didn't use a ton of this i still have
quite a bit left i'd say i'm probably
only right about here so um that was
kind of a bust but it's a good thing to
have around the house I just don't want
to have the low ha sent when I put it in
here is because I don't want Hawaiian
Aloha on Christmas I don't want to be
spraying on Christmas but I'm just gonna
keep using it like a normal pace man I
thought maybe I could try to use it up
but I'm not going to be spraying my
house with Febreze just because I'd
rather have a candle or something else
and honestly that sent wasn't my
favorite so I didn't want to spray it
extra I'm like in my room and stuff so
that one did not get used up the next
scent category is hand sanitizers now I
had four in here and I technically only
used up one which you guys have already
seen so the one that I ended up using
is this warm vanilla sugar one from Bath
and Body Works that one is done and that
one was done awhile ago now um I have
three left and I knew my last update I
wasn't gonna get all three done so i was
going to focus on these two so i didn't
even open this one this is coastal surf
and sun i love this scent but it hasn't
even been opened yet and then these two
I worked really hard so this one wasn't
even open and as you can see with that
black line that's where I got so I made
a little bit of progress on this this
wasn't my kid so I was using it in there
for makeup school I go to makeup school
if you guys haven't watch any of my
other videos or don't know anything
about me then this one oh I didn't mark
the line very well geez I don't know how
it was so far off on that one but um
this one I was up here at the last
update and I got down to past the line
I've marked and I was using this in my
purse so I made good progress I'm proud
of myself for washing my hands more
often but I did not finish any of those
up technically if I'd used the same hand
sanitizer for in my kit and in my purse
I probably would have used one up but I
didn't so I'm proud of the progress I
wish I finished went up but I still feel
good about the progress i made the next
site category are roller balls now I had
three roller balls in here and i only
made progress on one these were the two
that i didn't even touch these were the
roll on perfume oil from Demeter I think
it's how you might say that in one's
insult Aaron ones in dragon fruit I got
these in an Ipsy bag and I still have
not used them I was gonna get rid of
them and if I didn't use them up in this
project but i don't think i'm going to i
think i'm gonna keep them and maybe try
to use them up we'll see i'm gonna hold
on to him for now and then this is the
rollerball in my progress so honestly
because i had used this so much my
original market marked like had been
rubbed off completely so i remarked
where it was about and I got down all
the way to this mark here so I made a
lot of progress and that's only in like
20 days or so so I'm just going to keep
this in my purse I'm going to keep
working on using this like every single
break i have put this on and i know that
i'll definitely be able to get through
this by you know i probably in the next
or so and that one will be gone so I'm
glad that I at least was using it the
whole point of these projects is just
used up that you wouldn't have otherwise
so I am glad that this before this
project was a hundred percent full and
now I am over halfway done with it
number five I picked a body splash to
use up I have a lot of bath body works
stuff in these in this thing that's
where I get a lot of the sense that i
have so i only picked one little body
spray this is a travel size in the
country chic sent now I'm again with
this one they had completely rubbed off
the marking had completely ripped off so
i had to remarket that's about where it
was and i got all the way down to it's
hard to see but this line here i'm so
happy with the progress on this i
remember that i was trying to use one of
these up a long time ago and it took me
forever to use up travel size and this
one in 20 days i'm almost like done with
the bottom I don't know what if I was
just like a spritzing crazy woman and
just use this like a ton but i'm really
happy i barely have anything left so I'm
gonna just finish this up hopefully in
the next week or so why not and I'm
really glad that I did kind of kick it
into high gear and use a lot of this up
at the end I wish though I just used it
throughout the time so that would be
done but you know how we all are were we
procrastinate and we try to finish stuff
up at the end and it doesn't work that
way last cent category are wallflowers I
explained wallflowers in my last video
but this is what it looks like so it's
like a plug you plug in and then this
little cartridge has like a cent in it
and it heats up and makes your house
smell like the scent that's in there so
for this project I wanted to use up
three of the wallflower so three of
these little cartridges and I ended up
only being able to use up to in my last
update that is the amount i thought i
would be able to use up one more and
have one left over so at least I did
meet like my secondary goal after I kind
of already gotten into the project the
two cents that I have used up this one
was market peach this one smells pretty
nice I do think that it smells different
though in the wallflower than it does
like in the candle so I don't know if
I'd repurchase it it just definitely was
a different scent the other stuff that I
used up was ocean driftwood this one
smells really nice it's
have a manly scent but it's beachy still
it's not really nice it definitely was
it was nice it was in the corner but you
could definitely smell it it smells up
my whole house and then the one I wasn't
able to get to was sun-drenched vineyard
by bath and body works so I'm probably
going to stick this one in there now and
start this one going so at least I'm
working on the third one there that is
everything guys that's my entire update
and finale really this is my finale so I
feel good about the progress I made I
definitely wish I had kicked some things
into high gear before like the month
before the project was over but that is
life this is how it worked out and let
me know if you have any projects that
you've just ended i'm gonna start a new
project i'm going to do a roulette style
one because i had watched heather
warrants video and it was really awesome
i really like the way she did it so be
looking for that soon for a new project
pan that i'm going to start and that's
everything I will see you in next video
