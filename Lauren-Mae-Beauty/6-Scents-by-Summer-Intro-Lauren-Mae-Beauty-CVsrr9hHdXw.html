today I'm going to do a new project I
know I know I have a million going but
we just finished finished up in my
spring and I have found another project
through the budding minimalist which I
will leave her channel below as well as
her like starting introduction video but
this is going to be six cents by summer
in her video she has six different scent
types that she wants to use one thing of
each of I think minimally now I don't
have all the different types of sense
stuff that she has so I am tweaking it
for myself i am going to be picking out
six different sense categories and i'm
going to be setting goals of like a
number of however many i want to use up
in that category and i'm going to be
setting up goals for how many items i
want to use up in each of those six
categories so hopefully that makes sense
the time on this challenge is going to
be from March twentieth so technically
today until June twenty-first which is
the beginning of summer so let's see
which items I want to use up my first
egg category is going to be candles I
want to use up the sunset beach candle
by bath and body works this one was in
mechanical action video but I just want
to use it up i haven't used it yet i
think it'll be a nice candle
transitioning from spring to summer and
i have two of these so i'd like to get
it down only one so that one I want to
use up I also have this wood wick candle
in vineyard and just vineyard I've of a
vineyard great but it's just vineyard
and this is almost done I mean it's
right here I just want the bulk of this
like glass item out of my collection so
this one I want to finish up by the
twenty first of june i also have this
copacabana beach candle I've already
started burning this because I love it
so much i raved about it in my februari
favorites video it's so good i love it
so much i will definitely be getting
like five backups of this like i love it
that much but yeah i just want to burn
it and enjoy it it's one of those things
that sometimes I won't burn stuff and
I'll just hoard on to it but I want to
enjoy it since I love it so much so I
want to finish this one up I'm already
halfway or about halfway done with it
and the last kid all I want to
that by the twenty first of June is this
pomelo grapefruit one by bath and body
works just smells like grapefruit it's
nice fresh citrusy so it's also about
halfway so I want to use that one up and
if i use all these it before candles up
by that time which would be amazing for
candles on my collection at this point
i've already used up to and i've also
used up that chesapeake bay one almost
that will be in my next empties but
that's a lot of candles since I've moved
here which I'm so proud of myself go
Lauren go Lauren oh oh oh anyway if I
use those up I guess I'm like getting
ahead of myself here if I actually use
them then they'll be gone but yeah I
want to work on those as my first sent
category the next sent category category
the next category i have here are
wallflowers by bath and body works as
well so i have so many of these little
suckers like so many of them and i don't
even use them I don't have a Wallflower
going so I have three here I want to use
up this one's market peach i also have
sun-drenched vineyard and ocean
driftwood so i want to use those three
up these should be pretty simple the
biggest thing is you just have to change
them so as long as i have one plugged in
its going to do all the work for me I
just have to change it once it runs out
so I burn our candles in our main living
room area and then I'm going to keep
these in our bedroom so that that smells
good I also thought sundridge vineyard
might be a good one to plug in while I
was burning the vineyard candles kind of
like play off each other since but I
just want to go through three and kind
of just get into the habit of using
these up I just have so many of them I
think they're wonderful because when you
get home your house smells good you
don't have to be burning a candle for X
amount of you know hours or minutes to
have that scent so yeah I'm gonna try to
use up three of these in this challenge
kind of a weird one I want to use up
this Febreze Hawaiian Aloha scented what
is it air effects I don't know it's just
like a spray can to make your house
smell good my husband thought I was
insane for putting this in here he's
like why would you just have that in
there to use it up but I'm putting it in
here just to remind myself to use it
because it's summer scent and I just
don't want it hanging around i bought a
false end like two years ago and i still
had it like two years later it's mostly
like I don't use this that much so in
the bathroom we can use it we have
guests over whatever we also can use
this in the kitchen if it's starting to
smell a little grody or whatever um but
i just want to remind myself to actually
use this and utilize it so it's gonna go
in here i'm hoping to finish it up by
then you know i'm not trying to finish
it up because i hate it it's just more i
bought this and we don't usually use
this type of product so I don't know I
don't know if I'd be purchased type of
things to at least get it gone they're
just fun like they just suck me in at
the store it's like I don't know why I
doesn't make sense but anyway I want to
use this up and a story I want to use
this up by the twenty first of june i
have one travel sized body splash i want
to use up i am working on a body splash
in my project pan video which is by the
end of May so I didn't want to put
something in that would hopefully like
conflict with that one so I just put in
a travel sized one and i thought i would
keep this in my purse and just use this
while i was at school while I'm out I
can reapply this throughout the day
since it is such a light scent this is
I'm sorry this is Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
country chic and I've already gotten a
little bit of a start on it this is just
an older 1i have had this one probably
at least two years so I want to get this
out of my collection as well hopefully I
have not been moving through body sprays
like I thought I would if I was really
focusing on him so hopefully I can get
through this in that amount of time I
thought I'd just be hopefully an easy 1i
like this sent a lot better than the
other victoria secret or a pink one so
we'll see about this one but i'd like to
try to finish this one up the next
category are rollerball perfumes I have
actually three of them to go through so
to give you an idea to tell you what
they are I have Lola by marc jacobs i
have used just the tiniest bit of this I
don't like this then i got these roller
balls i got three of them from marc
jacobs in a set and this one came in
this is one is not one of my favorites
so I want to just use it up I've had it
for a little bit and it's time for it to
go so I want to use this one up if I
focus on these I've can get through them
quite fast so I'm hoping to move through
this one quite fast if I'm actually
using it and then these other two you
can't really read the writing I'm sorry
about that guys these two are roll on
perfume oils i got these in ypsi bags a
long time ago if you have these and you
know how long this is I have salt air
and dragon fruit I just want to use them
up or throw them away I kind of feel
like if I don't use them up through this
challenge I might just ditch him because
I've just had them so long they're not
since I picked out or chosen so they're
not like especially good to me they're
just kind of met so I'm hoping I can
just make it through these and I won't
have to throw them away because i'd like
to get them gone and actually used up
instead of just wasting the product we
shall see I think that the scent on
these is so light it's very light I
could probably layer this with other
things so we'll see how these go but I
would like to use them up and so that's
three roller ball so that is my fifth
set category so let's just recap candles
body splash Wallflower Febreze roll-on
perfumes and then the last one last
melons here these are this is also a
weird one I'm sorry I'm telling you it
was kind of a struggle but I still
wanted to do something that would count
as this one I thought it'd be fun so I
want to use up some of mine auntie backs
from Bath and Body Works I'm telling you
this body works crap but I want to use
up some of these I have four of them
here so this one is warm vanilla sugar I
am like almost done with this one so
that one will just be gone I have
Sicilian lemon here can't read it but I
promise you it is i have coastal surf
and Sun this is one of my favorite since
ever it came out last year with their
like summer collection and I love this
one in the hand soap so I know I will
love using this one up and same with
this one this is one of my all-time
favorites this is white pair and fig it
came out with the Christmas stuff it
smells so good i love
hand soap as well so I will enjoy using
these up I have so many of those little
anti back it's insane i probably have
like 15 more just in my drawer and i
don't use them so i'm hoping to put one
of these in my bag use them that way
also in my makeup kit we have to
sanitize our hands all the time for
school so I'm thinking about putting a
cute one in there and trying to use some
up that way so i think i think i can do
it i just have will have really clean
hands okay for the next couple of months
and that's everything those are my six
cent categories i am really excited to
do this challenge and i know i have so
many projects going but what i love
about this one is that it's all set
stuff so it's not going to interfere
with me using up other like makeup items
and my other project pans so hopefully
that will help and it won't be so
conflicting and like where it's like I
have to pre my shadows which one am I
going to choose or something like that
so I'm excited to get through some of
these products I challenge you guys to
do this definitely if you guys are
looking for something to do or if you
have a lot of scent products definitely
