thought i would film really fast before
i go to work i'm going to be doing an
update on my finished sixth sense by
summer I'm not gonna lie i've been
slacking on my sense a little bit just
because of work and everything one of my
goals is to just get really organized
i'd have to be now that my schedule is
like 110% full with any of these like
update videos and just like scheduling
and stuff not that i'm going to schedule
regularly on my channel in the sense of
like every tuesday and friday or
something but just to make sure that my
updates aren't falling behind or that i
don't know my videos just have more like
just better content to them and things
like that i'm trying i'm going to try to
just be more organized than i could be
when I do have a job you know I could
spend a whole three hours researching
what I talked about in the last video
and now I don't have that luxury so
anyway back to this update i'm going to
show you guys things that i have used up
so far i will link all my other like six
cents my summer like intro and the first
update down below i'm not going to like
going all that so what I finished up
last time candle wise I finished up my
cup of Cabana Beach I absolutely loved
this candle I know you guys have heard
me talk about a tiny but it just smells
so good it's amazing I really want to
get into a bath and body works and
purchase like five of these before
they're done with I just haven't had the
time and honestly I'm so proud of myself
I really haven't had the urge to buy
anything maybe I'm just so exhausted I
don't know what it is but I haven't been
purchasing like anything really that I
don't need so that's really awesome but
I finish this one up i also finished
this wood wood candle up this is in the
color vah yeah vineyard I always want to
say vine but it's vineyard and it is all
the way done this candle was okay oh so
awkward that's it there it burns all the
way down though so that's nice but it's
done what wicks are cool i like the way
they sound but they're kind of freaky to
the way they sound freaks me out
sometimes when I'm alone I mentioned
that last time and then the only other
thing that I sit
ished for my last update was this little
hand sanitizer this is the excuse me
warm vanilla sugar hand sanitizer so
only three things were finished up last
time and then I've only finished up one
more thing since then so we'll see how
this project goes the item when they
finished up this time from last update
to this one is the pomelo grapefruit
candle by bath and body works so that's
it there it's all the way done I really
like the smell of this it was like great
fruity really nice it was a good candle
I would repurchase it again but i also
would try something else too so yeah so
that's everything now i'm gonna go by
category and what i have left to use up
basically i haven't used anything else
in this project so i'm just gonna go
over it really fast show you guys what i
have left and kind of what i think i'll
be able to do this project ends the
twenty first of june and it is about the
22nd i think of may that i'm filming
this so i have about a month to finish
these items up and we'll see how it goes
originally i picked 610 category so i'm
not trying to just finish up six items
i'm trying to finish up six out of
categories so for candles i picked four
I have three finished I have one more
left this is the sunset beach one I
haven't started it but i'm going to
start burning it now and i have no doubt
that i'll finish this up by the end of
or like you know the twentieth of june
so this is going to be the next
candlelight burn and I mean I'm gonna
have to think about burning it a lot
more just because I'm not just here all
day long but I think we can get this one
done I think we can do it me and Sam is
the way I'm talking about here so this
is the phrase I'm trying to use up I
always mention it it's weird that I have
it in here but whatever um since you
can't see I don't know it sounds like
it's about here i don't think i'm going
to finish this up by the time then a jew
nor jun 20th but i do think that we're
getting a lot more use out of it now
that we're like thinking about using
and I definitely think I'll have it done
by the time this scent which is Hawaiian
Aloha is kind of like to summary to you
I'm not like marking it since I don't
know for sure where it's at so the next
category i have our hand sanitizers now
I told you I finished that warm vanilla
sugar one and i have three three more to
go this one I have gotten a little bit
of use from that was from like the last
update so I'm gonna stick this one in my
purse and I think that I can definitely
use at least one up that way i also have
a Sicilian lemon i'm gonna put one of
these in my kit at school i do use a
hand sanitizer with a pump at school
because i got at the dollar store and I
wasn't thinking about all use my bath
and bodyworks ones i was just using that
but i think i'm gonna switch it out just
to kind of finish this up in the time
limit see if i can finish in a project
put one of these in my kid and then this
last one is coastal surf and Sun I'm
gonna put this in my purse after the
other ones finish so maybe you know I
hopefully I'll at least get like half
way through this or something is what
I'm thinking um but I definitely think I
should be able to finish two out of the
two more out of the floor so in total
three of them we'll see that's my goal
at least at this point this far in the
game roller balls I haven't used any
roller balls I suck I have everything
that I had before this is the Marc
Jacobs Lola roller ball and then I have
two of the roll on perfume oils that
came in like Apes tea bags a long time
ago I'm really going to focus my energy
on this you can see the mark there I am
a little bit farther down so that's good
but I just I just finished up today my
people of juicy rollerball so spoiler on
that one so i think i'm just going to
try to use this up i think in a month i
can use this up especially now that have
a job like I can apply this before lunch
or before go to work and then apply it
also like during my lunch break or
something and see if I can use it up
that way so that's going to be my goal
the other two I said it was going to
throw them away if I didn't finish up up
but I feel like it's just such a way so
I don't know I'm just not focused as
much on them I
use the perfume actually like up before
trying to use these up so I'm not too
worried about these in the project my
fifth category so you know we're almost
down to the six categories by summer for
sense this one is a country-chic travel
sized Bath and Body Works fragrance mist
I have two little marks there you can
barely see him I haven't made any
progress and the reason that is is
because this wasn't my person I was
making more progress on it than another
body / I had in a different project that
was ending the end of may so I'm
actually gonna stick this in my purse as
well and i don't know maybe switch off
like I'm i have three breaks at works
you have a ten-minute break you have
your 30 or i have an hour lunch break
and then another 10 minute break so i'm
thinking of like switching off when I
spray these like spray this on the 10
and the other one before going to work
in lunch or something like I don't know
I'm just gonna try that see how that
works but I don't think I'm gonna finish
this I don't know if I should just focus
on one that I think I can finish or try
to make significant progress in both let
me know down below if you have a thought
on that I kind of like the idea of
finishing one thing but I hate that I'll
know that I'm not going to finish the
other one in there the project which i
know i'm not going to finish it anyway
though hmm I probably just will work on
this one then maybe I'll just decide
that now so I can hopefully have it
finish so um yeah we'll see hopefully
I'll have this finished hopefully
fingers crossed and then the last thing
last night category are wallflowers
these are things for Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
that you plug into your wall this is
what they look like so i forgot to
mention this i did finish another item
this one was the market peach um
Wallflower it's a hundred percent right
up it's not smelling at all anymore so
that's good i actually have finished
five items now right no four no five
yeah I've now finished five items not
for so that's good two more items this
thing so I have two other wall flowers
that I was trying to work on so three in
total I have ocean driftwood by bath and
body works and also sun-drenched
vineyard so I'm going to pick one of
these put this in the thing
I definitely think I'll get through one
more of them I don't think that I'll get
through the other one though just
because I basically I wasn't being super
conscious of like when this one got done
and i'm sure i could have changed it out
probably like three weeks ago but i
didn't so you know just wasted time on
my my part but I don't know which one
I'm gonna go with I like them both I
guess I'll probably ask him and see
which one he's feeling and then we'll do
that that is my quick hopefully quick
little update um yeah I'm gonna try
really hard to be a little bit more
organized and you know YouTube right now
besides school is like the fun thing in
my life so I really want to put energy
toward it even when I'm tired and so
hopefully you know I can kind of get it
together and write some stuff down be a
little bit more organized let me know if
you guys are doing something like a
challenge by summer six cents by summer
or six items by some are whatever you're
doing down below in the comment so i can
check it out and if you guys have any
questions or comments or anything down
below leave them there in the comments
and I will hopefully try to get back to
you I will see you guys in my next video
