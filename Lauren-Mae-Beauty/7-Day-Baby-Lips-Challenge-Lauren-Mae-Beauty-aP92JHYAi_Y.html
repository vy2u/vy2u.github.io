video is going to be a baby lips
seven-day challenge video now I don't
know if this is a video that's real or
an idea that's real someone left it I
think in a comment down below in one of
my really early video so I've been
thinking about it and stewing over it
and I wanted to try it so I'm going to
be trying to use this baby lips up in
seven days this is the color yummy
plumbing i think it was limited edition
it might not be i'm not sure i just have
so many baby lips I'm sure all of you
guys can relate they're so cute you buy
a billion and then I never use them I
kind of want to see how far how much I
can use in a week's time so I'm going to
be updating you guys every single day
now this is a full stick of lipstick our
baby lips it's a full tube and we'll see
i'm going to try to use it up i have
used it today twice already it is like
almost eleven o'clock on saturday so we
will see how this goes i'm going to be
trying to apply this as often as i
possibly can without being wasteful like
I'm not going to put it on take it off
put it on take it off or anything like
that like I want to actually use it and
it's not that I don't like this product
I just kind of want to see how much can
you use if you were using it I mean as
often as you really possibly could how
far could you use this in a week's time
so i will be updating you daily on this
let's see how it goes you know depending
on how this goes i kind of challenge you
guys to do it too i want to see how far
you guys can get with maybe it does have
to be babe lips you could do whatever
but i just think it'd be fun with our
baby lips so that's this challenge and
we're gonna do it I'm gonna mark these
and have each day next to it so we can
see where the progress goes and I don't
know we'll see the clips or to follow
all right bye guys hi guys i'm here to
film just a quick update it is now day
two of my seven-day challenge for my
baby lips and this is the progress i'm
on till May zoom in so for day one when
i started i was at the first mark there
and now i'm at the number 2 i'm super
excited with the progress so far if you
look at inside the tube that's how much
progress I've made in there so hopefully
that was sufficient progress that you
can see that's everything
done and it is right now about to be ten
o'clock on sunday so it's been basically
24 hours and I've made a decent amount
of progress I think so I'm just gonna
keep working on this seeing where it
goes and I will update you next time hi
everyone so this is going to be my
basically start of day three so it is
Monday right at about eleven o'clock and
i'm going to show you the progress that
I've made so far so we've gone from
saturday to love until sunday and eleven
an hour from Sunday to 11 at Monday at
eleven so two full days have gone by
this is the progress that I have so
that's where I am on progress not as
much progress is made yesterday because
I didn't use it as much as I should have
but we're still going strong that's what
it looks like inside so that's how much
I've used of it okay so that's my super
quick update i have to go because i'm on
my way to work so i'm really going to
focus on using it today make sure it's
in my pocket or with me so that i can be
using it and we'll see where we're going
after today like when I film tomorrow
well almost at the halfway point so
we'll see wish me luck bye see you next
time okay so this is going to be my
update this is it's technically tuesday
at like 7pm so i did film this one a
little bit later than my other updates
but i had school and I had a work
meeting at like eight so it just wasn't
going to work out anyway let me show you
guys the progress and then I'm gonna
kind of give you like a halfway update
point how I'm feeling what's going on
just to let you guys know so let's get
into the progress first room you in so
that is the progress i'm at so far so
I'm worked on my day so i'm on day four
right now and again i'm going until
saturday at eleven o'clock so i feel
good about that progress i think that
looks really good it's not quite halfway
down the stick but you know and then
just to show you guys how it looks
inside the cap so there's a little bit
of there's a lot of progress in there I
feel really good about how much is being
used so as you guys saw from that update
that's the progress i'm at so far I feel
good I
am a little bit past the halfway point
right now so I still have tomorrow which
is wednesday i have thursday i have
friday oh wow you have a lot i have
three full days and a little bit into
Saturday so I feel good I'm definitely
having to work to remember to put it on
because this isn't normal for me it's
not normal to our lip products so it's a
weird feeling having like constantly wet
lips I'm not used to I'm used to having
more of a dry lip but I'm definitely
making progress this is definitely a way
if you want to try to like get through a
baby lips I don't know if I'm gonna make
the week mark and finish this up in a
week but you definitely can make a ton
like a huge dent if you really just
focus in like hone all your energy and
everything into one of these I know a
lot of us collect these I was collecting
them at one point and I've kind of
decided to stop only because you know if
you're still into it I you know I
totally get it they're so cute and part
of me wants to but I'm trying to be good
I don't know I just found that I have
these they're not my favorite formula
I'd rather have the fresh ones the fresh
sugar lip balms those are actually great
lip balms I'd rather have those and be
using those then just keeping these
little baby lips around because of the
packaging so I'm trying to work through
a lot of these this year and this is
definitely an easy way to do it I
encourage you at this point I'm still
feeling confident that i can definitely
I can definitely do it i don't know i
think it's possible i have a little bit
of time left so i'm just gonna keep
pushing and we'll see on the next update
and by the end of this where I'm at
we'll see hi guys i'm here to update you
on my BB lib 7 day challenge progress so
um I have a little bit of a disclaimer
to say so on I am giving myself an extra
day because I forgot to bring this to
work with me and I used it that night
and then I didn't use it all day and
then I decided not to use it until that
night again so that it would be a full
like 24 hours before I used it and I'm
going to give myself an extra 24 hours
so I'm still it's only seven days still
but it's technically in eight days
because one day I didn't use it at all
and I
really didn't want to I didn't know what
I wanted to do like it feels like I'm
cheating but I also you know I didn't
use it at all and I want to give myself
a fair chance so I'm giving myself an
extra day let me mark where I'm at
because I didn't use it much yesterday
um either but I mean I'm not giving
myself an extra day for that when I just
just the day I forgot it and I was at
work all day I was like I'm gonna give
myself more time I will zoom you guys in
so you can see the progress of where I'm
at so here's a close-up of where I'm at
so um a little bit of progress
technically i'm on day five it is friday
right now I'm starting talking with it
all blurry but you know how it goes so
that's where I'm at inside the container
so it's definitely getting smaller so I
am definitely you know still making
progress on this thing I'm working hard
I really want to see how far I can get I
don't think I'm going to finish it at
this point which makes me so sad but I'm
going to try to use it a ton today see
how far I can go it is friday right now
it's friday at almost 11 so i have until
sunday and 11 because they added that
extra day and because i didn't use it
for a day so i still have two full days
of use left on it i don't think i'm
gonna get through that much product in
two days that would be crazy but I do
think it'll be like a little nub so
really excited with that and um I will
update you guys as soon as i can on
probably tomorrow before go to work so i
will see you then bye hi guys i'm here
to do my finale for my seven-day Baby
Lips challenge now this is it let's see
the progress not disclaimer but spoiler
I didn't finish it and I didn't actually
get as far as I thought I would not
because I couldn't but just because of
how it worked out with my job it's hard
to keep this on me and remember to apply
it if I'm wearing a dress so I noticed
on the days in a word dress I did not
make as much progress on that so before
I go more into detail about my
experience and what I thought worked for
me and what I didn't just my thoughts in
general let me show you the progress i
made it is been seven days that I
trying to use this up and let's see how
I did so here is the lipstick or the
baby lips I have it marked day one two
three four and then five and then
instead of doing a six I didn't film
that day so this is just the progress
for both of stays for six and seven
where the seven is so this is what i
have left i'll put it next to it for you
guys to see so i used about half the
stick i'd say and then inside that is
where it's at so as you guys saw my
progress throughout the days i did not
finish it i got about halfway through
the tube and i know i could have gotten
farther had i applied more I definitely
had room to apply this chapstick more to
my lips throughout the day and to see
more progress but I am very proud of
myself this is something that I wouldn't
have even started how to not tried this
challenge and I'm over half like I'm
about halfway done with it so that's
really awesome i only have if i wanted
to keep using it as much as i did i'd
only have about a week left on it i
think it's amazing to see when you
really focus on an item how far you can
really get it done i think this is a fun
challenge is to see how much i could use
like yeah I wanted to use it up but
overall I just wanted to see hey I have
seven days how much product could I have
used and it was a fun challenge just to
just to do that kind of experiment and
see where it was so I definitely
challenge each and every one of you to
try this at home see how you do let me
know your progress or if you're going to
try and down below in the comments and
some tips i guess or tricks i definitely
would suggest if you are at work or
whatever to have it out have visible so
that way you're constantly reminding
yourself to put it on I don't know if
you want to go so far as to like set a
timer because that's pretty hardcore but
you could always set a timer and try to
apply it like once every hour or
something I feel like on the days when I
was wearing pants and had it in my
pocket it definitely I definitely
applied it more on those days and then
when I had a dress I'm just the type of
person like I don't go in the back I
don't like text at work I don't go into
my purse except for on my break so I was
only applying it throughout an eight
hour period like maybe three times
if I had it on me I would have applied
it more often it's really the biggest
tip I have I mean besides just using it
I replaced any lip balm and lip product
with this product so it was the only
thing I used on my lips for the whole
week and that's really everything I just
tried to stay motivated it was fun to
mark my progress each and every day so
that I could see how much I was using it
and that kind of motivated me like wow I
used so much more this day let me keep
doing that or oh wow i barely use any I
better use more tomorrow I hope that was
helpful I hope that one tip was helpful
and again let me know if you do this
challenge down below in the comments and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
