I thought I would do a tack video I
really haven't done a tag except for my
mother daughter tag which I'll link down
below when my mom came into town we just
did that because we thought it'd be fun
it didn't exactly go as planned that's
for sure but yeah if you guys aren't
just said I'll leave it down below but
this tag is gonna be the seven deadly
sins of beauty tag so the questions for
this tag all are relating to the
different deadly sins and they're all
beauty related except for one really
weird one but we'll get into that and
then if you guys want to do this tag
definitely do it I will leave the
questions down below and I tagged each
and every one of you this was like an
older tag but let's bring a book the
first question is greed what is your
most inexpensive item and what is your
most expensive makeup item for the most
inexpensive item I have this piece
friend eyes shadow and apricot ax now
this is a really pretty peachy gold any
color that's it's watched on my hand I
did get this off of all cosmetics
wholesale so I know that I only paid I
know I paid under two dollars for this
shadow I want to say that I painted
probably like maybe dollar fifty maybe
even less than a dollar so this is my
most inexpensive item or at least of the
things that I can kind of remember
pricing for expensive I would have to
say my NARS palettes um this is the
narcissist eyeshadow palette these are
$79 piece I believe the dual intensity
shadows are the same price um yeah
they're really expensive I'm glad I have
both of them I'm especially glad I have
the dual intensity ones I think these
are more unique than the other one but
yeah eighty dollars for eyeshadow
palettes that's kind of insane and they
did have my kind of a runner-up those
are for like individual items too like
for this one palette it was $79 now most
expensive we're about like a kit I guess
you could say with multiple items in it
that aren't that expensive that has to
go to these babies I got eight of these
it was in like a huge to my Goddard
office for comm it was a hundred and
fifty dollars for all eight of them and
I believe there
only eight out at the time or it may be
they still only have eight out but eight
cream shadows cream and they were $150 I
think I might have gotten 10% off or
something I don't see why I would just
go insane and buy that if I didn't have
that but yeah also a huge regret but
yeah so that would be like runner up if
we broke it down and in a separate week
for most expensive ducking question
wrath what beauty products do you have a
love-hate relationship with and what
product was the hardest to get my
love-hate relationship item would have
to be just sharing blushes in general
this one I used to use all the time with
your Too Faced it is the sweetheart
blush in perfect flush blush there is
quite a bit of a dip in it um I love
sherry blushes I think they look
beautiful and when you apply them at
first I think they look great it's just
throughout the day on my skin depending
on the other products I'm wearing I
don't know what it is in certain light
it just is like pores city all my pores
are just like out for the world to see
it looks like the surface of the Moon
and it's horrible also if you just have
any blemish or any just you know rough
spot it just enhances it and then
throughout the day it just looks like
oil and shimmer
oh it just doesn't look good so lately
they have not been my love but I did
love these before and I love them but
they just don't work out for me on a
daily basis and I feel like when I look
at them at first I love them and then
throughout the day it turns into a
horror story so shimmery blushes are we
love hate relationship product and then
the product that's hardest to get
honestly don't have a product that I've
had a hard time getting usually if
something's limited-edition I just kind
of like let it go if I didn't get it
like I'm sad and I wish I've got it but
I'm not gonna pay like crazy prices on
Amazon or Ebay or anything like that so
I kind of changed this question a little
bit the item I feel like that would be
hardest to get in my collection would be
my lorac mega Pro this palette sold out
really real
Sam got it for me Friday anniversary I
think and he was like on the website I
mean thank you thank you Sam
um he was on the website he was like
watching people tweet about it like oh
it's not oh they said it in DM and
whatever so um yeah he got me this
palette and I'm really glad he did and I
think this is probably the most like
difficult to get now product in my
collection so that's what I have to say
for that or I do have Glinda the Good
Witch palette and I got this way after
this actually came out so I guess that
would be I mean you know I feel like I
would have been able to get it if Urban
Decay didn't somehow release them again
or put them on their seal page so this
one I really wanted and then I got it
later on so I guess this one account too
I don't know I'm just not super into
like map collection so I'm not trying to
find exterior rows or like all those
really hard to find ones I think that
one's a little bit in addition it might
not be I really don't know anything
about Mac number three gluttony the most
delicious beauty product so I know a lot
of people would say the chocolate bar
palette I personally think they smell
good but like it's not it doesn't
compare to real chocolate people let's
get real so I chose my fresh sugar lip
balm I love the smell of this this just
smells like lemons
but like fresh but still sweet it just
smells so good and I love putting this
on my lips the feeling it tastes nice so
I chose yeah the sugar lip treatment and
it's just the original one doesn't have
a tinge or anything like that
number four sloth I'm reading off a
piece of paper sorry guys I can't
remember everything what beauty product
do you neglect due to laziness I don't
feel like there's a beauty product or
necessarily neglect I do usually do a
full face like almost always I don't do
lips all the time but I don't think
that's kind of laziness I just don't
feel like I always need a lip product
but I will say there are some things
beauty related that I don't do and I'm
really lazy about number one would have
to be cleaning my personal brushes I
clean the brush
to make it but something about the
brushes for myself I just can't be
bothered I don't have the time I don't
know how people I like respect people
who watch their own brushes that often I
think that new Libra new brushes apply
product ly better I wish that I had
clean brushes every time I use a dirty
brush but I just it just takes so long
to wash them and I just don't do it it's
something that I need to work on but I
don't deal and then the other thing is I
do not pluck my eyebrows I have blonde
eyebrows so really I just like make my
own eyebrow and just let the rest like
cover it up with like foundation or
whatever so I wish that I was better at
plucking them and actually just having a
real shape even though you can't really
see it because it's blonde but plucking
my eyebrows it's also something that I
am super lazy about I'm so glad I don't
have dark eyebrows only for that because
I would hate to have to pluck them all
the time like how no one has time to
torture themselves daily number five
what beauty product gives you the most
self-confidence
speaking of brows brows definitely give
me the most confidence again I have no
brows really I'm gonna have hair there
but I don't have any color to my brows
my lashes are blonde my brows are blonde
I'm a natural blonde I'm a diet this
blonde but I naturally have light
features so without brows I just feel
kind of weird that being said I couldn't
just wear my brows like if I painted
just the browser on and had nothing else
you think it'd look really kind of
strange but definitely brows when I hung
my brows on I feel like give that
attitude you know what I mean so that
makes you care like confident brow
products that I use it switches like I
don't necessarily use all of these every
single day but it switches between
different products every day so
depending on how I'm feeling or the look
I'm doing or what I'm wearing might
change up the tone or the darkness the
sheep is never the same so yeah one of
my favorite brow products is the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills brow is this one's in
dark brown I wouldn't go this dark again
but I would go lighter than maybe taupe
or maybe even
little bit darker cuz I do like a darker
brow on myself even this is clinics soft
blonde pencil I'm honestly not really
into this color of this pencil it's very
similar to the Maybelline one in like
the way the product is but color wise
it's just a little too ashy for me so I
used that I'm gonna use it up this is
the older brow tint and it's kind of
like the benefit one has a really small
little brush and I like that one if I
don't want to like fill my eyebrows in
too much I can just kind of run this
through and it gives that color and then
last that I own I have another part I
tell you if I'm telling you browse our
whole production
this is Anasazi at Beverly Hills brow
gel it's just clear and this just really
sets your brows so if I'm not using that
Ulta one then I'll probably use this I'm
like out of breath talking about the
brow products and then last year I have
a brow quad and this just has different
colors in it and I switch up the colors
that I use so yeah this is something I
want to finish up it into them here and
really any powder I'd like to use powder
a lot just because it just gives it a
softness that pencils don't and I'm not
super into like crazy drawn brows drawn
on bras crazy drawn brows I like them to
be a little more natural not really I
don't know I just don't I don't like
what it looks like you use gel no I'm
not into that those are all my brow
products and browser definitely what
makes me feel the most confident when I
wear my makeup
the next question is kind of weird it is
lust and then it says what attributes do
you find most attractive in the opposite
sex that does not relate to beauty like
at all but you know to humor to humor
the tag um I mean I have a husband so I
was thinking about things I guess I find
the most attractive in him um
one if I'm just gonna rename off one
really shallow physical attribute I like
in guys I like tall men I think Thomas
is like sexy I don't know
and the m62 so
and then integrity I think integrity is
really big on for me like I don't want
them to be a good guy when I'm around I
want them to be a good guy to everyone
else and when they're in public
I I think to me it just as important
that they're not like making fun of
people or just being a bad human being
but when I'm around they're a good guy
like that's not okay with me and you
need to be able to hold your own and
have integrity if you're gonna be in a
relationship with me and then last I
just need someone who's fun I myself can
get a little serious or not being a
drama queen but you know I have anxiety
and different things so I just need
someone who's fun and funny and
laid-back and Sam definitely is that we
always have a ton of fun together he
lets things roll off his back and that
just helps situations just turn out to
be a better time than they would be if
he was like uptight or got upset easily
so those are my attributes I don't know
it's such a weird it's a weird question
and then last number seven Envy what
items would you want to receive as a
gift now sometimes it's hard for me like
makeup wise to receive stethoscopes just
because they do have a lot of stuff but
if I had to answer this question I think
it's weird to gifts like this is a weird
question again for me but if if I had to
say like things I'd like to receive from
people that maybe identify myself would
be like Mac items again like I was
saying I don't own a lot of Mac I don't
even I like ten eyeshadows meeting and I
really want to get into more my stuff
but just something about it I just don't
gravitate to it I can't get it off a
Sephora and I don't just shop off the
Mac website and I don't go in a Mac
store so if I was asking for a gift I
think it'd be fun for people to give me
a Mac that I was just because it's
something totally new for me and
something I want to like learn more and
get into more I don't know I'm so out of
breath anyway guys that's everything for
this tag let me know if you do this tag
down below or if you already have so I
can check it out and I will see you in
my next video I'm probably filming a lot
of videos just cuz I don't know what my
schedule is gonna be like once I start
school again because I had like a week
break and once you start my job so I'm
trying to like keep the videos coming
for you
I'll see you next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
