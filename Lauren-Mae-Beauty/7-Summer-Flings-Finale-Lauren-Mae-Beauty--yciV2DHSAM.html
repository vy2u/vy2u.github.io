Lauren this is going to be my 7 summer
flings finale video I can't believe that
it's fall September has gone so fast so
I wanted to show you guys my progress my
update on this project I feel like I
haven't updated you guys in a while and
that's because if I'm being honest I
feel this project was a bit of a fail
especially I feel like for how well I
normally do in my projects that is life
I did my best and let's just get into
the product so first off I did finish
the pink beach body miss this is in the
scent sunkissed and it's all the way
gone I started the project all the way
up here and my last update i was there
and i finished it off i enjoyed this
till the last like spray it's not really
nice i really enjoyed using this in the
bathroom and it was great and the only
other item that I used up was the Tiki
Beach candle I'm really happy that I did
use it up both of these were very
summery sons so I was glad to be able to
use them during the hotter months when
it was just more appropriate and you
know just kind of festive to use these I
still really like the smell of this and
just to give you reference I started the
project i believe all the way up here
and I marked it down here but this is as
far as the bath body where scandals
usually burn I can't like the wicks
anymore and I'm going to be cleaning
this out and just reusing the container
and that's it that's all I used up um
yeah I have a bit of progress on a few
items that were really kind of closer or
that I feel really good about and then
the rest we're kind of like around so
keeping the positivity this is the
keratin complex style therapy sweet
definition texturizing sugar missed and
I started all the way up here and I got
all the way down here i used this so
much i tried so hard to finish this I
feel like there just wasn't enough time
to finish this especially with how often
I wash my hair I did my best so close I
am gonna finish this off and just get it
out because I'm so dying clothes I want
to see it gone really happy through this
in the project I know if I hadn't
seriously I would have never used it not
even one time that is positive to me and
I'm glad to get it out i would not
purchase this though the other item I
feel
like had quite good progress is the
alterna hemp organic straight
conditioner now I was just using this as
a shaving aid like a shaving cream
because I can't use conditioner very
much like I just don't have a lot of
hair so if i use to have you have
conditioners i'm just done for plus i've
just moved on to only using nioxin
because i have like four hairs on my
head so anyway I started the project all
the way up here and I got all the way
down here that is so much conditioner to
go through again if I hadn't put this in
the project I really don't know how much
I would have used so I didn't quite get
it to the bottom and I know that if I
shaved more I could have but I am still
really happy with the progress on this I
feel like I can definitely get this out
by the end of the year and that's going
to be kind of like my own mini goal on
this now just because I don't it's just
so big it takes up so much space and I
just want it out but I'm glad that I got
through that much product because of
this project there are three more items
but I only have two more to show you I
decided to return the honest beauty
you're honest cosmetics whatever the
brand is I cannot remember oh the honest
company I think their sunscreen I just
you guys told me that it doesn't work
very well and kind of freaked me out
that way and then I watched some reviews
and the same thing and then it's just a
mineral sunscreen which is part of the
reason I was excited for it I mean I
wanted something that was mineral but
it's just unrealistic in the sense that
it takes forever even if you put the
tiniest drop on it takes forever to
really buff it into the skin so that way
it doesn't have a white cast and already
it's so difficult for me to put on
sunscreen it's just like to make it a
habit one because it's a lotion and all
that so then for it to be kind of
difficult on top of that just I didn't
want to use it so i returned to that
costco i'm really proud of myself for
that because we got our money back on it
which was so nice I feel so happy that I
did that and that's the thing i want to
encourage you guys to do but also just
continue to do for myself keep receipts
and if you really don't like something
don't just like give up on your $13 go
return it and get your money back if
they have a return policy that will let
you do that so that's what I did and I'm
really happy with that decision the next
thing here this is the Kula face makeup
setting spray and has SPF 30 I was so
excited
about this I remember hauling this
because i got it from work right before
I left and I was so excited but this has
a greasy residue that I just don't like
and I don't want to make this work I
don't have a use for this in my makeup
bag because I don't want them to be like
Gracie since I don't like it i know i
don't want to spray it on other people's
face so I'm gonna give this to my mom
and see if she wants it I seriously use
this maybe five times for the whole
project not good but it made me realize
that I don't like it and I am proud of
myself for passing it along instead of
just keeping it and wishing I'd use it
and not and the last item here this is
the lotion this is the sensi layers
skinny dip and Body Lotion I'm pretty
sure this is discontinued I made it to
hear i do believe i started at the very
top so there is progress not nearly as
much as there should be i'm not a lotion
person i don't like wearing lotion i
feel sticky and gross and I found that
because it was hot I didn't want to put
on lotion even more because it already
was sweaty and then putting this on I
just feel like even more sweaty so
hopefully for winter and by the end of
the year I can use this up when I feel
like my skin will just need it more and
it won't feel like such a nuisance
because it's dry my skin's dry and I'm
not a sweaty so I'm hoping to finish
this by the end of the year that's my
update um I know it's not as good as
some of my other ones but these weren't
makeup items and it's weird because I
felt like these were a little bit harder
to do than actual makeup items because I
mostly put makeup on every single day
it's part of my daily routine and so I
feel like I can easily get progress in
items because i'm using them every day
these ones i definitely had to change up
my routine switch it up and really try
to use them i'm happy that i used up a
few i'm happy that I decided to pass on
a few of them and hopefully I can get
the other ones done by the end of the
year that's everything I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day and I'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
