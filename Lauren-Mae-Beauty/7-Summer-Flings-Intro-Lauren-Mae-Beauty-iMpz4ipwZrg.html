is going to be an intro to a new project
p know this is the seventh summer flings
this has started by stephanie from the
days eagerly i will leave her channel
link down below i absolutely love her
and when I saw her do her intro video I
was like that is like the cutest name I
really want to do it but I already knew
I wanted to do a project pan roulette
for finished 13 by halloween and start
that kind of early and as you guys know
I do a lot of like makeup items in my
project pans and I thought they'd be too
much so I thought I would keep it really
summer themed like the title is supposed
to be and pick more body care and just
different items to just straight-up make
up for this one so that way I could
still do it and support her and do that
project cuz it just looked so fun but
still actually be successful because
that is the main point is to hopefully
actually clear some things out so these
are these seven items that I want to
finish during summer so I'm gonna start
it a little bit early I'm not starting
on like June twentieth but by the end of
I think it's September 20th or 21st I
think that is the end of summer and I
want to be through these items and I'll
go through as I show you them why I
picked them but some of them are kind of
like duh that's why you picked it but
here are the 7 items I picked for my
unit 7 summer flings a body spray we
know I'm trying to go through the body
spray so I thought I'd pick out a really
summery sense that i've had laying
around for forever this is the pink
beach sun kissed spray they don't even
make this anymore it's in totally
different packaging I mean this is old
this smells really nice and I'm just
going to be working on this as you can
see I'm just slightly down from the
beginning so I have like a tiny head
start on it but really it's basically a
full item and I'd love to get this out
during summer because it's appropriate
for the season and I don't want to be
working on something like this and fall
necessarily i just have other sense that
would be more appropriate than this is a
sunscreen that i just got this is from
honest honest company i got this at
costco in a 2-pack for 1099 i just
bought them this couple days ago
actually like a week ago the reason i
want to put this in here just to force
myself to use sunscreen i got sunburned
on set the other day and I peeled was so
hot and I didn't even know until I got
home how sunburned I got so I definitely
just want to be focusing on you
this and I like that it's more safe and
gentle it doesn't have like bad
ingredients in it i know i'm really
excited to use this specific sunscreen
but also just to kind of protect myself
and i really want to like protect this
area because the Sun hits it so much and
i know that's one of the biggest places
you age because of sun damage so I
really want to protect my skin I live in
California and it's it's gonna be sunny
here I mean it's always sunny but in
Philadelphia ah it's always sunny but I
definitely want this summer to get good
use out of this not only because I
bought it but because it's protecting me
I'm throwing in a body lotion and I'm
kind of scared for this but I definitely
need to get it done this is the matching
sent to the body spray used up in my
project ease it up this is the sensi
layers skinny dipping body lotion they
don't even make the scent anymore when I
was trying to link that fragrance down
below in my project geez it up I
couldn't even find on their website so
this is old everything's old it doesn't
smell bad that doesn't seem to be
anything wrong with it I just want to
use it up it's a definitely summary
coconutty like mixed drink kind of smell
it's quite strong but i do really enjoy
the scent and i definitely think that in
three months i can use this up get the
sent out feel like summary and nice
because i'm using this but also work on
a body lotion this is like the only
makeup related item in here this is the
coulomb makeup setting spray and it has
SPF 20 green tea and a low i bought this
because i thought it was such a great
idea to have sunscreen in a makeup
setting spray and then as the day went
on you could touch up your sunscreen
without ruining your makeup and i just
thought that was genius I've not really
been using this at all i've used this
maybe three times so it's basically full
something that it does say is that the
thing will get clogged and i hate that
but it must just be the minerals in it
because you do have to shake it up when
you use it but again sunscreen for
summer and everything I think it's just
a really good time to use this and I
want to get my money's worth out of this
this was expensive i did get my discount
on it when i used to work not the beauty
store i worked at but i still want to
use it up and get it out of my
collection just because it it hasn't
become something that's a part of my
daily routine this is a hair product
this is something i've never used even
though it looks like i have it's just
evaporated in the bottle this is from
keratin complex and it's the sweet
definition
texturizing sugar missed it's kind of
like one of those beach spray type of
ideas I just got my haircut when I was
in a town with my mom because she's a
hairdresser so she dyed it blonde and
then we just cut it off I just like it
short like this when it gets too long I
just start feeling gross and it's just
nice so I really like having like some
texture to my hair adding some volume
because I have really liked lifeless
limp two strand hair so this will be
nice i've never used it so hopefully
it's not too sticky or oily or greasy or
ways my hair down or anything but i
thought this would be perfect for like
this summer beach waves not that i don't
i don't even know if i'm going to be
doing those but now i'm going to write
because i have to use this up but i just
want to get my money's worth out of this
too i didn't actually pay for this this
was part of gratis but again it's not
even money's worth is just like wasting
like I just hate things sitting around
and wasting away I want them to be used
and to be used up so that it's just not
wasteful and just having and hoarding
things I'm just against it right now
like hardcore so I want to use that up
that's ultimately what I wanted to set
two more items this is a candle this is
Tiki Beach from Bath and Body Works i
actually have burnt this one time and
i'm going to just put one candle and for
now but as I use this up if I happen to
use this up before the end of the
project I'll just like replace a new
candle in here for it this is one of my
favorite sensor in bath and body works i
just love coconut sends i just love them
so much that this one is really nice and
i just want to burn it during summer I
haven't been burning a ton of candles
lately but I need to at least be moving
through my collection still and just
getting that down i really only want
like four candles on hand I just don't
need that many our apartment small the
time it takes to go through a big three
wick is quite a long time so I don't
need like 20 candles on hand anyway I
want to use it up in the last item this
is like a big ol conditioner and I don't
use a lot of conditioner I'm the girl
that goes through shampoo faster than
conditioner which is like no one else
but this is I think it's about right
here I'm going to be using this as a
conditioner for my legs when I shave and
that's why it's summer things because in
the summer you hopefully shave more than
the one
right so I'm gonna try really hard to
shave my legs more I'm really bad at it
I know that sounds horrible but I don't
I'm married like I don't have anyone to
like prove anything to it's not a big
deal plus my ears blonde so I don't
really feel like so conscious about it
too much like it being like really dark
or something so anyway I'm really trying
to focus on using this up and I figure
the best way and the fastest way for me
to use it is to use it to shave so I'd
like to get this out by summer I've had
this for so long my mom gave it to me
she got it for like ten dollars I don't
want this but again I just feel like
it's so wasteful to just like throw it
away so I feel like this will be the
best way for me to get rid of it those
are all the items I want to finish up
during summer and by the end of summer
if you guys want to join this project
definitely do I think it's really fun i
hope you guys you're having a wonderful
day and I will see you in my next video
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
