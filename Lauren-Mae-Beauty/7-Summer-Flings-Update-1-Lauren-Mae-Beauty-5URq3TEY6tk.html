Lauren this is going to be my update on
the seven summer flings the days you
girlie started this or Stephanie I will
leave a link down below definitely go
check her out and let's just get
straight into the progress i have on the
seven items i picked we're just getting
straight down to business today let's
start off with my body spray this is the
pink beach sun kissed a body spray from
victoria secret this is discontinued a
long time ago but that is where I
started and now i am down here i feel
like if i continue to use this how i
have been in the last couple weeks that
i can finish this up so i'm just working
on this i use this in my bathroom and I
spray it every time you use the bathroom
I spray it like 20 times so they can get
through these I like because it's
summary and oh it's my favorite one I've
used in the bathroom so far just smells
so nice and subtle but enough that you
can smell it it's just not overpowering
and it doesn't smell too cheap and like
I know you know some body sprays and
kind of smell a little cheap or
something this just smells really good
so I'm really happy I'm getting use out
of this and I'm really enjoying it the
next item I have to show you is the
keratin complex sweet definition
texturizing sugar missed I've been using
this in my hair what mostly so every
time I get out of the shower I try to
spray I think I've been counting like
six sprays or so I'm trying to up it to
ten and see if that bothers my hair at
all I don't like this I don't like the
way it smells it smells kind of vinegary
it's not you would think it smells sweet
and delicious because it's the sugar
missed but not it does not I'm really
trying to get through this I'm really
happy with the progress I did make like
I can't believe I actually used some of
this but if it stays that small I don't
know how to be able to use this up so
I'm really gonna try to find a way to
use this more often in my hair I'm
basically just forcing myself to add
this to my routine and use it I don't
see a difference I don't enjoy this
product you don't recommend it yeah
that's my progress on that one at least
there's progress though that's exciting
this is a huge conditioner I'm trying to
use up for summer this is from alterna
and it's the hemp organics straight
conditioner I started up here and i am
now down to here i've been using this to
shave my legs and it's been working
really nicely for that i will say
towards the last couple of weeks i
really haven't been
in this in the shower every single time
like I was the first couple of weeks so
I feel like I can make more progress
than I did in this like spurt of time if
I was using it consistently throughout
the entire time if that makes sense so I
think this is definitely doable i just
have to stay on top of it every single
time not slack on it but i'm glad that
there's some pretty major progress in
this this is the body lotion i put in
this is from cincy and this is the
skinny dipping sent this was entirely
full when i started I'm about here on it
it's kind of like a weird bottle it's
like really denti but there's definitely
good progress on it I think I can
definitely finish this up I just have to
use it that's always the issue right you
got actually use it for it to go away I
like the smell of this but Sam always
sneezes want to use it which really
sucks so i've been using this as a hand
cream at night every night or trying to
and then on the nights that i can stand
it when it's not just crazy hot i I
don't want to feel sticky or just yeah
basically any night I can I can stand it
I put it all over my whole body body
applications are definitely gonna be the
way to get this gone in time I'm really
trying hard to just force myself on the
nights that I can to put this all over
and the last item that I have progress
on is my candle and Tiki Beach and I
started here on the line and now let me
I don't have a marker I'm so sorry guys
but I'm down to here that's where the
line is so I've made some progress I
actually was just burning it that's why
there's a color variation because it's
still hardening up so you guys already
know I love this scent so I'm enjoying
using that and there are two items that
I really haven't made much progress on
at all if any one would be the coolest
setting spray I've used this maybe five
times I just don't find myself
gravitating to setting sprays I don't
enjoy them hopefully I can get this into
my routine that's the biggest thing and
that's how I feel like I'm so successful
in my projects is I really make sure
that I incorporate whatever items i'm
adding in to a project into my daily
routine it's not something that i use
just once or twice a week it's something
i try to use every single day because
you're going to get the most progress
out of it in the shortest amount of time
and you're just going to get out of your
collection so I always find that the
products I struggle the most with are
things that I can't seem to incorporate
into my daily routine so this is
thing that I need to work on and just
make sure i'm actually using it there's
no way to show you guys progress on it
so hopefully i can get through that one
this summer and then the last item is
the honest company mineral sunscreen I
had no idea about like the controversy
about this and tell you guys are
mentioning it in the comments so i
looked it up and I think for some reason
that's like making me not want to use it
which is horrible because part of the
reason people don't like this or is
because people have been badly burned
because they use this and it didn't
actually protect them from the Sun but
if I'm not using any sunscreen it's like
kind of the same thing so I need to use
this I have not tested this out to see
if it works in the Sun so I just need to
be putting this on every single day I
just haven't been I think I've used this
may be a couple times because i knew i
was going to be on the beach for set and
that was it so that's everything for my
seven summer flings I feel good with the
progress that I'm making I chose all
items that aren't makeup and just things
that I felt like or summary and that I
wanted to get used up before the summer
was over so that they weren't just
rolling over in my collection and
hanging on I definitely think I can get
a good five of these done those last two
though our kind of stragglers so
hopefully i can pick it up this next
month and i will see you guys in my next
video i hope you're having a great day
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
