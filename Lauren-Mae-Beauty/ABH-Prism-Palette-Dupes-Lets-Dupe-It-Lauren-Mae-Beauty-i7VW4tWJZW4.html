Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing another episode in my
let's do fit series I'm gonna leave the
playlist link down below if you haven't
checked this out but this is a series
that I do where I do buy popular palette
or a palette that maybe I want or just
something out there with my single
shadows and the reason I choose single
shadows is because I can take them and
just singly put them in my palette
arrange them the exact same way as the
palette is and get the same color
inspiration that I would if I had the
palette at my house so today's palette
that we're gonna be duping is the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills Prizm palette
and I'm really excited about this this
was something that was in an anti haul
video so it's something that I
definitely knew I didn't want to get
it's beautiful don't get me wrong but I
got subculture and I really like the
colors in there and something that I
realized and I'm not talking about them
for the formula and the controversy with
that I'm talking about the colors and
myself and as much as I love those
colors and I think they're so so
beautiful when it comes to doing
eyeshadow looks they're definitely not
colors that I gravitate to every day
they're I'm not gonna use those blues
and greens every day and so to spend my
money on a palette that has a lot of
those colors and it really deep tones
you know having one of those palettes is
okay but that was just something that I
wanted to keep my mind on and make sure
it wasn't getting a lot of those in my
collection so when Prizm came out I just
I love the colors in it but there's
something about it that kind of is
reminiscent of the subculture palette I
know a lot of you guys will be like it's
so different and it probably is but for
me I don't know it's just kind of
similar I definitely knew I had the
tones that were the most exciting either
I had them or I just wanted that one
color I didn't want the whole palette
just to have that really like bright
electric green colors so I'm excited to
show you guys the palette I guess I just
will you know stop holding on to it down
here but deep deep D these are my dupe
shadows but here is my subculture what
not subculture but here is my prism dupe
palette I'm really excited about this I
think it's very very similar this colors
like really bright on the monitor I'm
excited to run through these shadows
with you I don't have a ton of bonus
shadows because honestly I feel like
some of these are a little bit unique or
just feel like no this is the shadow I
have like I don't have like or this one
or this one or that one a few things
before we get into it
I know it's already been a few things
but a few more things I know that single
shadows can be expensive and so if you
were to buy all of these it's gonna be
more than the palette and this is more
about diving into your collection using
what you have I obviously have a lot of
single shadows so that's what works for
me but if you don't I suggest going into
your other palettes looking for shades
that are similar and working with it
that way so I get that these are more
expensive also something that I've
noticed though as I do more and more of
these palettes the colors that I use
sometimes are repetitive so you might
invest in one single shadow it for five
dollars from colour-pop and that could
do so many different colors and so many
different palettes that come out so keep
that in mind to that it's more up front
initially but long-term you have that
matte burgundy shadow that could do so
many other shadows out there I think the
last thing I wanted to mention is that
there will not be a demo for this look I
did do it get ready with me for this eye
look though so if you want to know how I
did this you can check that video out
but there won't be a demo portion to
this I'm sorry I know I tried to do that
for you guys but today just didn't work
out also these are similar shadows as
similar as I can get to the colors that
I see online these aren't meant to be
exact dupes it's more about the color
inspiration keeping the spirit of the
palette and sometimes I take my own
twist on things so I think we did it
timestamps are below but let's get into
these shadows I just found out that my
husband switched is like acting thing to
another house so we can film all day
long yo so the first shadow in the
palette is the shade lucid now this is
described on Anastasia's website as a
duochrome white gold with a pink reflect
I didn't have anything with that pink
reflect but I do have a dual chrome
white gold and that would be the color
now in
from colour-pop this is one of the newer
shadows from them I bought it in a
bundle so it came at a really nice price
came with some really beautiful shadows
and this is a really light white but it
has a gold reflect to it that duochrome
super pretty
I mean exactly like the shadow in the
palette I think this is a very very good
dupe for that color something that I
suggest in your own collection though if
you have any highlighters that have that
like white gold duochrome you could
definitely use that in place of lucid as
well so I'm thinking of colors like
marshmallow from honest osseous sweets
of glow kit and anything similar to that
with that like high gold reflex will be
very similar the next shade in the
palette is Eden and this is described as
a ultra matte coral pink color I didn't
have anything that I felt was like an
exact exact dupe but I definitely have
comparable colors and I think a lot of
you guys might have comparable colors
out there as well since these corley
oranjee mid-tone matte colors are all
the rage so for my dupe I chose the
color petal peach from Coastal Scents I
really like this shadow I have a bit of
a dent going in it it is matte and just
so pretty this is a perfect transition
shade for someone with lighter or medium
skin tones I'm not sure how this would
look on someone with a darker skin it
might look a little ashy because it has
that kind of pastel quality to it but I
really do like that color I do have a
bonus shadow for that color though this
is color pops flower boy now I believe
this has been discontinued so this is
only for the people that happen to have
this shadow I feel bad when I mention
things that are discontinued or no
longer available but at the same time as
much as I make these videos for you guys
they're also for me to stop me
potentially from buying a palette and to
get color inspiration from the shadows I
own so you know hopefully if you have
any dupes or things you think might be
similar definitely leave them in the
comments I like to have that as a place
where people can go to for you know
other suggestions or things that work
for you guys if I don't happen to match
them in my palette anyway that is flower
boy to see you guys know what this one
has a lot more pink in it but I
definitely
would serve a similar purpose and I
really like it I think it's really weird
they discontinued that color
the next shadow in the palette I feel
like is one of the most boring shadows
but was really hard for me to do
actually so this is the color unity and
it's an ultra matte nude ochre I decided
to go with a pretty nude color but this
doesn't quite have as much yellow as
unity does this is the color faded from
look see beauty I have a whole review on
look see eye shadows I definitely
suggest checking that out before you go
buy from the website just so you guys
can get my comprehensive thoughts on the
brand and yeah how my experiences so
this is what it looks like it's a very
very light now it looks like it's more
of like a highlight shade on my hand and
in swatches but when I put this on the
eye it definitely gives me a very very
subtle crease color so this is
definitely gonna work as potentially a
highlight depending on your skin tone
but for a lighter skin you can use this
as a very very subtle transition I wish
I had something just a little bit darker
but everything that I had was just a few
too many shades darker so unity and the
palette to me is something that you can
kind of put whatever you want in there
whatever you would probably use unity as
fill that spot in your palette with a
similar or comparable shade the next
color in the palette is one of the
really stunning metallic shades this is
the color Sphinx and this is described
as a metallic warm bronze I'm really
happy with my dupe this is the color
board shorts from colour-pop if you
can't tell I love color pop single
shadows I think they're amazing quality
for the price so I mean it's so
beautiful I love that this doesn't pull
too warm but it's also not too gold it's
just so stunning and look at that sheen
on it this performs as like a high-end
shadow if this was a Natasha Genoa
palette I wouldn't know the difference
like this is an amazing shadow so highly
suggest this I do have a bonus shadow
for that color as well though this is
the color and e23 from Coastal Scents
I will leave the actual name listed down
below and all of these shadows will be
linked as well if they are not like
discontinued and I can find them this
one is so similar though I mean they
look like the same shadow Coastal Scents
is going to be a bit cheaper there's a
little bit more
than orange to this but again still a
very high shine on it a great shadow
especially for the Coastal Scents price
I think Sphinx as well as a lot of the
other like metallic neutral shades that
are in these pallets they're so
beautiful in a catch our eye but I think
we have a lot of very similar shades in
our collection if we go through palette
if you go through our single shadows I
don't think there is unique and amazing
as you might think initially looking at
the palette I just think they're one of
those colors that like immediately draws
your attention the next shade that I
have is it's a little bit off so Osiris
is described as a metallic midnight
violent with a red reflex so really
pretty this looks like it has a lot of
sparkle to it and all the pictures that
I looked up so I didn't find anything
quite like that in my collection but for
my take on that color I decided to go
with center stage from makeup geek this
is one of the foiled shadows and I think
this shadow is nice I don't use colors
like this all the time but this is a
blue with a I don't know it has like a
purple to it it almost looks into go to
me I feel like if you put it next to
purple it look blue if you put it next
to blues it looks purple that's what it
looks like there so it's more of a
metallic again it doesn't have any
shimmer or like to shine and sparkle to
it but it's very very pretty I do think
it almost has like a purple like
something to it it's not quite it's not
do chrome by any means but it definitely
has like a purple sheen to it so I
thought that would be kind of similar
but definitely nothing quite with like
that red reflex that Osiris has the next
color sphere is probably the one that
you were so excited to see what my dupe
was when I held up the palette you're
probably like oh my gosh you're actually
is a dupe but I'm sad to say that this
one is actually discontinued so you're
not gonna be able to get this this
makeup brand doesn't exist anymore but
this is the color of fireflies from
stars makeup Haven this is the only
color in my collection that is even
similar somewhat similar the website
describes sphere as a ultra matte
electric green yellow
I would definitely think that this is
very similar this has a bit of a shine
to it but it performs ultimately as I
met and honestly I feel like this
performs a bit better than the swatches
I've seen of sphere so I really wish
that I could like link this for you guys
but if you have any dupes again please
leave those down below for anyone if
they want to just pick up a color like
this I'm really happy with this one I
just wish you guys could get it too it's
a great color I like using a color like
that on my inner like corner it's so
pretty it pops the eye it would look so
good with this look even so um highly
suggest that I might actually add that a
little later but yeah I would love to
know any dupes if you know them so that
we can you know get one now the last
color in the top row is the color
obsidian and it's an ultra matte deep
black so honestly you can just do this
with whatever you want any black shadow
in any palette if you have any of the
lorac palette so you've got it if you
have like basically any eye shadow
palettes you probably have a matte black
somewhere but if you want a really good
one the only matte black that I have in
a single shadow form is the color let's
do it by color pop this is also included
in the color puff I think I love you
palette so if you have that you have
this exact shade and you can pop those
little shadows out of the magnetic
pallets if you want to see someone who's
done that and put them in a palette I
will leave Jacqueline Levine's video
down below I'm like tempted to do it but
I'm kind of nervous I don't know like I
like the packaging and the color
combination so I might I don't know what
I'm gonna do I kind of wanted to pop
them all and put them in a big pallet
though and see them all together and
move them around but I'm not sure let me
know what your guys's thoughts are
anyway this is a really great black
super pigmented yeah I mean for a five
dollar shadow I think that's a really
good black the next shade dimension in
the palette is a dual chrome silver grey
with pink reflex now I don't see any of
that when I see it in a picture so that
is not the direction I went I also don't
have anything quite like that so we're
going we're going off into Lauren land
and we're just picking our own little
dupe here that I think looks cool what
the palette is maybe a little bit
different I do have a bonus shade as
well but the first color here is the
shade Noir from look
see beauty this is a really pretty like
shimmery blue it's like a blue with a
bit of a purple and a little bit of grey
I thought this would play well off of
the other makeup geek shadow that's in
here with the blue I thought this would
look nice with the orange since they're
complementary like I just I just wanted
to add the zoom in here and I thought it
looked really pretty with the palette I
just kind of bumped up the blue with
this one so that is the first color now
if you're wanting to stick to more of
the gray tones with dimension I suggest
the color platinum blue from Coastal
Scents this is a silver metallic and it
is great but it has that blue undertone
there's something about it that's a
little bit blue obviously not as blue as
noir though so that one is a nice like
more neutral option if that's what
you're looking for the next shadow is
called parallel and this is an ultra
matte truffle shade now these shades and
palettes honestly put any like warm
mid-tone whatever Browns gonna work for
you like that Brown would work we have
them in every freakin palette if you
don't need my specific dupe to get a
color similar to that but I do have two
different options in case you just want
to know my take on it but there are so
many out there guys and you definitely
have these in your palettes but anyway
that being said this is the color a
little boat from colour-pop I really
like this shadow this one's a little bit
I think deeper but it still has that
little bit of warmth I think it'll play
nice with that orange we're gonna come
up too soon so I just I really like this
shadow I think it's so so pretty now if
you're looking for something maybe a
little bit lighter than that but you
still want the warmth C stars from
colour-pop is also really pretty oh my
gosh it almost dropped it my heart is
beating so fast
I really like it so that's them next to
each other and also swatch them on my
hand you'll also see them in like
swatches but those are the two next to
each other I think both of us are nice
you could do something in between those
colors but really any like warmer
mid-tone Brown or like whatever mid-tone
is to your skin tone I think would work
nice next we have a really pretty gold
now this is described as a metallic
yellow gold with a green reflex and the
color shade name is pyramid
definitely doesn't have any of that
green going on but I did decide to pick
a shade from makeup geek this is the
color magic act and it is just a nice
soft gold
it's definitely yellow but it's a little
bit lighter it's not as that's like um
yeah just like yellow yellow as the one
in the palette is that's something I'm
realizing I don't really have in the
single shadows is something that's
really a yellow true yellow gold but I
tend to prefer shadows like this more
you definitely could do something in a
palette I'm sure I have stuff in
palettes that is more similar to this
color but when it comes to single
shadows this is the one I suggest I do
really like it I love the high shine on
the makeup geek foiled shadow so magic
act is a really nice similar color not
quite an executive the next shade thrown
is also a really stunning shade in the
palette one that I think a lot of people
would like dip their hands into it and
be like okay I have to have it so they
described this as a metallic blackened
Bluegreen with multicolored reflex I do
have two dupe options for that the first
one and the one that I think is the best
dupe is the color Omega from look see
beauty now the formula on this is not
necessarily my favorite it is a very
powdery color but once you get this on
the I use little fix plus it's
absolutely stunning this is so pretty
and it does have a bit of a I wouldn't
say this has a blackened base but you
definitely could put a black down and
then put the shadow on top of it it
shines green it also has some purple
into it a little bit of like a hot pink
shows through at some points so I think
this is so pretty
I honestly think this is probably
prettier than the color in the palette I
know I don't know for sure cuz I don't
have it with me but I I would put my
money on this one instead of that one so
highly suggest that color and then if
you're looking for something different I
just wipe the swatch off even though
it'd be good to compare them oh you're
looking for something different where
you don't want to buy from luck see this
one is from makeup geek and this is the
shade Houdini again very very similar
this one definitely has more depth to it
it has more of that blackened base it's
not going to have as much of the reflex
so keep that in mind really pretty just
doesn't have quite that do
aspect oh yeah see this definitely has
that more green because it doesn't have
that black and bass so pretty though I
think both of those are so stunning
though and they remind me of like
Beatles you know like scarab beetles so
pretty three more shadows to go guys
next is the orange and the palette that
is called Stata and it's an ultra matte
terracotta I had quite a few different
oranges and just different tones of
orange but I have this one and one other
dupe this is cannon ball from colour-pop
such a pretty color this is insanely
pigmented quite powdery but I mean it
gets you there and it gets you there
fast it's a really pretty color really
highly suggested and it isn't matte just
like the color in the palette if you
want something a little bit brighter
because cannonbolt does have a bit of
like brown or just something muting it
just the tiniest bit
I suggest the color marmalade from
Coastal Scents this is like a true
orange like pumpkin orange it's a matte
as well super bright also very pigmented
so that is the color marmalade down
there the next shade in the palette is
the color eternal and this is a metallic
violet copper is what they describe it
as I decided to pick a copper color from
Coastal Scents this is the shade NE o3
again the proper name and the new name
will be listed down below this is such a
beautiful shadow I remember when I was
living in Arizona this is like my
favorite color to put on my lid I wore
this all the time and I really like to
pair it with blues as well I think this
is an amazing shadow very very pretty
I will swatch the color board shorts
just so you can get an idea of the
difference here's a quick comparison the
top is board shorts and this one is the
Coastal Scents shadow I'm saying as a
dupe while I did that I dropped my
palette so we had a few casualties
including the shadow I'm talking about
currently that one's actually not as bad
as the dupe for this one like the bonus
shade that one's completely crumbled
into nothing so bear with me when it
comes to swatches anyway we're gonna
move on I think I
that one enough it's really similar it's
a copper color it's really pretty I like
the quality of it don't drop your
shadows the last item that I have to do
from the palette is the color learn this
is described as a ultra matte ashy lilac
I didn't have anything quite similar to
this I really wish I had something like
that I feel like ler and sphere were the
two colors I really really wanted but I
did decide to go with B color dreamboat
from colour-pop this is a purple toned
like cool toned purple mauve super
pretty I was it was going back and forth
between this and ho from Mac but I think
that this one is prettier I like it
better like the formula better so that's
why I decided to go with this I
definitely want to look into getting
some more like ashy lilac colors I think
they look so pretty in the crease
Anasazi is modern renaissance palette
has the color what's it called
I can't Bond fresco I think that's what
it's called that's very similar as well
I mean it's not exact because hello then
it'd be the same color but it's very
similar like that ashy like more purple
mauve color so I suggest checking out
that color if you have it at home I
really hope you guys enjoyed my dupes
for this palette we're gonna get into
swatches in a second again bear with me
if I don't show you the shadow because
it's crushed to pieces and I just show
you swatches or whatever I don't know
how I'm gonna figure that out but thank
you so much for watching and if you want
to stick teen for swatches those will be
next bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
