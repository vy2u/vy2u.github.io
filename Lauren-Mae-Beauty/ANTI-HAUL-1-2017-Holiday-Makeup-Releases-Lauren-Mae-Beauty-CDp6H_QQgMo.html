Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing a Manti haul
I have never technically done an anti
haul on my channel before I do something
called new Beauty launches where I talk
about new things and say if I want them
or if I don't and just kind of give you
my opinions but this is a full-blown
anti health these are items I'm not
gonna be purchasing that I don't want
I'm gonna tell you the reasons I don't
want them and I might be a little sassy
while I do it if you're gonna pick these
items up you know that's awesome I hope
that you love them but these are items
that I've decided aren't gonna they're
not gonna do it for me I'm not spending
the money on them some of them I don't
understand some of them I just think of
boring yeah we're gonna get into it
though my first anti haul that I watched
and started by Kimberly Clark you guys
all know I'm going to leave her channel
link down below but Amber's Beauty chair
also has anti hulls and did them
originally too so I'm gonna leave both
their channels down below so you can
check them all out and I think that's it
let's do this I forgot to mention that
this is all holiday related so it's all
holiday 2017 collection items that I'm
not picking up that I do not know so
first lorac mega Pro floor I know that a
lot of people are saying they're gonna
get this but like the best thing about
this to me is the pink packaging nuts it
I don't know what's going on with lorac
when it comes to their pro formula
that's like one of my favorite formulas
of eyeshadow I have the 1 the 2 the 3
the mega Pro one two and three and so I
was excited to see what this palette was
gonna be this year but like I'm so bored
guys I'm so bored I don't understand the
shadow concept I don't understand I just
don't understand what the heck is going
on I feel like the last couple of
releases that they've done with their
pro formula I don't understand either
the lorac I love brunch loved the
concept loved the colors but the
pigmentation on them sucked the Beauty
and the Beast collection the Pirates of
the Caribbean collection like what the
hell is going on and so no I
I'm not picking this up I'm not spending
what sixty to sixty five sixty dollars I
don't know how much it is it's way too
much for me I feel like the colors that
pop out at me the most there's like a
green a gold and like a really pretty
burgundy but those kinda remind me of
the vice 3 palette which I have declared
and that one is more colorful and
definitely more mean so
there is no way I'm gonna get use out of
this pallet I know I'm not gonna miss
anything in it and if I want something
like it I'm sure I can find it within
the other lorac mega Pro and lorac Pro
palette that I have so no way I'm not
getting it the next item that I am NOT
gonna buy are the cover effects mini
custom cover and answer highlighter
drops the highlighter version is what
I'm trying to get across they are coming
out with a mini set for holiday which i
think is a nice because you can try it a
bunch of different colors and I did want
this originally but the more I thought
about it the more I thought I don't even
use liquid highlighter why would I get a
set of four of them and then on top of
that they're not all gonna match my skin
tone and I could justify this and say
I'm gonna put them in my makeup kit and
use them there but I never used liquid
highlighter unset either so I feel like
if there ever came a time where I was
doing something editorial I would either
make something work on the fly out of
what I already have or I would go and
purchase a product specifically for that
shoot so I don't think I need to spend
the money now because what if that comes
up like seven months from now I mean I
want fresh products and I don't want
these sitting in my drawer wasting away
I've also heard these are super glittery
which is not my style so I'm not gonna
do it I'm not gonna spend forty two
dollars on a little set of stuff that's
just gonna sit in my drawer and if I
really want to try this formula like
later down the line I can but I don't
want to get sucked into the fact that
these are minis and just get it because
of that so I'm actually not gonna be
picking that up and I'm really happy
with that decision I definitely don't
need it and I'm not gonna buy it the
next item that I'm not gonna buy and I
definitely don't need is the tarte color
wheel blush palette this is very similar
to last year's blush palette it's a
double sided palette with five shades of
blush or slash highlighter on each side
I did get the one last year and a have
it in my kit this year's is definitely
very deep in tone which I think could be
great for darker skin tones but I am NOT
a darker skin tone so it's not gonna
work for me
and then for my kit I just don't need a
bunch of those colors at the moment I
feel like I have enough deeper brighter
shades already in the colors that I have
so I just I just feel like this is not
an everyday palette and if you're gonna
buy ten
blushes they need to be shades you're
gonna wear every single day and this
palette definitely is not that I will
give them props because it's different
than last year's and last year's was
more every day but no it's enough for me
Doug and then you know in general it's
like tart put out so many blushes like
how many blushes has Tarte put out in
the course of the last like four years I
think within this holiday season they
came out with the big blush book 30 they
came out with this color wheel I'm
talking about now they're coming out
with another set which is like next on
my list it's like five separate blushes
and then they're coming out with the
palette like they normally do with four
different blushes in it it's like insane
so moving on to that set that I just
talked about with like mini blushes from
Tarte I remember I used to love these
blush sets I picked him up every year I
loved em and I've decluttered so many
throughout the year so I know I
definitely don't need this and something
that I'm realizing is like it's great to
get things in a set but it's like I want
to try different formulas and brands and
I feel like I keep gravitating to Tarte
blushes and all I'm trying is Tarte I
want other things and if you pick up
this set you're just gonna get tired and
you're gonna be stuck with more tart and
if you've ever tried to pan a blush you
know that that's a lot of blush so no
I'm not getting any of those don't want
them don't need them I want other stuff
I want new stuff gosh get out of here
the next thing I'm not gonna pick up is
the Sephora favorites set this is like a
big ol set I think it's 75 dollars it
has a Beauty Blender in it which i think
is awesome cuz I love the Beauty Blender
I believe it also has a full-size of the
YSL Touche Claw in it - in the number
two
but that's something with this set that
kind of sucks because they're pre
picking these items for you when it
comes to things that are specific color
and you would need something about your
skin tone or your eyebrows because
there's an Anasazi eye pencil in there
they're not gonna work for everyone so
this basically works for someone who's
like light maybe medium skinned with
darker features and I am pretty fair and
have lighter features so it's just not
gonna work for me it's not gonna work
for people with really dark skin either
so that just kind of sucks
and it's just a lot of money I feel like
a lot of these items are things we've
already tried in the our collections the
Kat Von D locket setting powder I'm not
a fan of the make up forevers powder is
okay
but I just don't want all these little
minis of these items especially for $75
you could really get a couple items that
you are going to love this could totally
work for someone if they haven't tried a
lot of these brands and those like
variable items are gonna work for them
but for me it's just not something I'm
gonna drop that much money on I'm just
gonna buy a beauty blender and then buy
whatever else I want I'm not going to be
purchasing that I have a couple more
things to talk about this next one's
gonna be a little controversial and I'm
kind of surprised I'm not gonna get it
but I'm not gonna be picking up the cap
on the sinner and Saint palette or saint
and sinner palette it's beautiful
packaging I think the packaging so
pretty I get the whole concept but the
colors in it just they just don't work
for me and I've noticed that every year
with Kat Von D's Christmas palettes
besides the me vida loca I'm just not a
fan of them I feel like they're jumbled
I don't really I don't know I just don't
get inspiration from them I love that
they're pigmented and bright and
something different but when it comes to
actually using them I never do I had the
star studded palette never used it and
declared it the me vida look I really
like and it has it in a rainbow that
one's great
last year's palette the middle matte I
felt like I shouldn't have gotten it but
I did it anyway and I regret it so I'm
not doing it this year I know I won't
regret this palette the shade that I
want the most is like that chartreuse
and if I really want that I can find it
in a single from another brand and enjoy
it so I am NOT gonna be picking it up
I'm gonna save myself the sixty
something dollars and I'm actually
really excited about that because I just
saw that Fenty beauty is coming out with
a palette for holiday and it looks
really pretty so I'm gonna look into
that I have two more things to kind of
talk about kind of next I'm not gonna
pick up any of the NYX lip faults if you
want some tips and tricks on how to shop
holiday and get what you actually like
because that's the thing that's most
important it's picking up items that
you're gonna love six months down the
road I will leave my tips and tricks for
shopping holiday linked down below so
you guys can check that out but in that
video I talk about vaults and I say
don't get them so I'm not gonna be
getting any of the NYX lingerie vaults
they like liquid lip creams it's crazy
it's insane it's way too much any of the
vaults where you're getting like
everything into line it's too much guys
unless you're gonna split it up and put
it into stockings where you're going in
with a bunch of people like that makes
more sense but if you're buying this
you personally want to collect and have
all of those different colors I just
don't suggest it I think it's a waste of
money you're gonna waste the product
because there's no way you're gonna use
it up before it goes bad I just don't
suggest it and I definitely will not be
purchasing them myself I just think
they're ridiculous and laughs in general
I'm not gonna buy anything from Hertz
like whole collection I know I just like
rag on Tarte for all their blushes but
they're their eyeshadows I did see a
video and they swatched really nicely so
I'm really happy with pigmentation on
that but I'm not gonna buy anything from
their to their collection it's just so
boring to me it's so just general and
basic um same with Too Faced and have
like this whole planner thing and blah
blah blah it's the same old crap and I'm
not gonna pick up any of that stuff I
don't really think make these
collections for people who are like
diehard makeup fans because honestly
like we have all that and to me
these only make sense for people who
don't have a lot of makeup so they can
get a ton of makeup hopefully better
quality than the drugstore for Christmas
and enjoy it and love it and use it all
year long and the next Christmas comes
around they get a new palette and it's
all exciting but if you're staying up
with all the releases and you buy like
everything Tarte you know all about all
these different brands it's like don't
spend your money on these please they're
so expensive for the same like ten brown
shades that you already have in your
collection a hundred times over so I'm
not buying those I'm not even interested
don't want to get them out of my life
it's just boring it's just news fast get
out of here
no like cute packaging just really
doesn't even face me anymore like that
would be the one thing like maybe but no
mm-hmm I don't want it I'm not gonna buy
it I hope you guys enjoy this anti haul
I hope it inspired you to maybe not get
some things that were on your list or
look within your collection and see if
you have similar items already let me
know what you're not gonna be buying
down below in the comments and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
