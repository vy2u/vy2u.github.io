Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing an anti haul
and I love anti hauls I've done one
other one before so I'll leave it link
down below if you guys haven't seen anti
hulls I don't know what you're doing
with your life I first watched these
from Kimberly Clark but I know that
Amber's beauty chair has also done them
so I will leave both their channels link
down below check them out and other than
that let's get into it I don't do any of
the disclaimers like we're talking about
products that I don't want to buy I'm
being a little sassy it's all in good
fun this is just a reminder that we
don't need everything is you don't have
to buy everything and it's okay to like
be selective and not one everything so
let's get in to it I was actually
surprised with some of the things that I
ended up like not wanting that are on
this list so first off the first oh the
first thing I want to talk about is this
Too Faced glitter mask now I know that
glam glow also came out with a glitter
mask but I I don't understand the
glitter masks like besides the fact that
it'd be a pretty Instagram photo like
that's it I don't understand what the
benefit is like literally glitter will
do nothing to help your skin I'm not
gonna pay any high price for literally
glitter in my skincare what I think this
is like a fun concept but then when you
get to the execution of it it's just
kind of like why I don't know it's just
not my style and I'm the type of person
that like wants to put glitter on
everything like I love glitter but I'm
just not into it I'm also totally not
feeling the name to base is naming it
the glow job like I don't know if I'm
just like a prude or what but like I'm
just not feeling that like I don't want
to put literally a facial mask on my
face called glow job like no it's not
edgy or cute to me it's just gross and
yeah I'm not feeling it at all
it just makes me feel uncomfortable and
I don't like I don't know there's just a
lot like I do not like about that whole
naming situation and being a woman and
being like excited to like show off your
glow job mask I'm that's enough of that
I think we can all get the point on it
but definitely not feeling that would
never spend my money on it
it's like buy a glitter gel and spreads
them on your body and go to Coachella
but like you don't need a glitter
all right next product let's talk about
Anasazi as prison palette I really
thought this was something I was gonna
pick up I was excited when I saw the
colors and you guys know that I did pick
up the subculture palette I did end up
returning it it just wasn't something
that worked out for me if you want more
on it I'll leave the video I made linked
down below
I feel like this palette looks very very
similar to the subculture palette so I
definitely don't think you need both
when I really break this palette down
the only colors that I've been to our
sphere and leur and I feel like I could
just get single shadows I just don't
want to buy into the hype for this I
feel like I just won't use a lot of the
colors they're really really dark and
those aren't what I wear on a daily
basis so I don't want to buy a whole
palette of them I honestly feel like I
could do a lot of these colors in my
single shadow so I am NOT gonna be
picking this one up and that's like a
hard one for me just because I feel like
whatever Anasazi comes out with I'm
usually really excited to buy it and
kind of will like just buy it no matter
what kind of like Kat Von D but um I
don't know I'm waking up guys Anna I'm
not gonna be getting that palette next
let's talk about the violet Voss rainbow
palette I was kind of excited to see
something colorful from them but I just
I find that this palette just doesn't
quite hit the mark for me it's all
shimmers there's ten different shades it
retails for $30 so I feel like the price
point is it too too bad but some of the
colors in there like the two Purple's
look very similar I feel like there's
like a blue and green that look kind of
similar I just think they could have
gone a little bit farther with it if I
was going to get some of these like
really pretty neon like vibrant colors
I'd probably just go with something from
sugarpill it just didn't quite hit the
mark for me so I will not be picking
that up I really wanted it to be
something good although I know this is
an anti haul but I am tempted by the
newer palette that's kind of like cool
toned from them I thought that looked
really pretty anyway we're talking about
things we don't forget I said that next
on my anti hull list are the Natasha de
Nonna
holiday palettes these are like 5 or 6
pan palettes I think their 5 pan
palettes and they retail for $48 so it's
super expensive for 5 shadows but like
affordable in the sense that you only
have to shell out $48 to get something
from Natasha de Nonna
I want to be picking either of these up
I do think that they're pretty but I do
have the Leela palette and
I like it I think it's beautiful um I
just it's too much money it's too much
money I realized for me I just I don't
think that there's a shadow that's
actually worth $100 I'm sorry it's just
not true and for me I'm not gonna be
using the Lila palette enough so I know
I won't be using those palettes enough
like there's just no way if I was to
pick up one I felt like the Aries is
that what how you say it one looked the
prettiest with that like red and like
blue shadow but other than that I just
feel like the palettes that she comes
out with are really beautiful but
they're very editorial so I do not
understand why so many people go so
crazy because most people wearing
neutrals so I don't know why these
neutral girls are like loving these
palettes because you definitely cannot
use these on their own and they're so
expensive
I don't know yeah not buying those all
right I'm gonna throw out a couple like
neutral warm tone palettes that I just
won't be picking up because they're
neutral warm toned palettes and I don't
need them first is the Tarte tartlet
toasted palette ya know not feeling it I
get that other people might like it if
this is one of their favorite formulas
or whatever but I will say there's a
shadow and they're called crackle is
that yeah crackle what the heck why do
they throw these shadows in palettes
it's basically like a matte brown with
like glitter in it I just hate the
chunky glitter shadows I don't know why
they still exist can we please have a
comment hit them and let them go extinct
like the dinosaurs because no one likes
those shadows I know that like toppers
are in or whatever the fenty Beauty
toppers and there's also some in the Kat
Von D but like no I don't want toppers I
just don't like them I'm not a fan of
them I think they're just a very
specific thing and if I'm gonna pick
something up like that I probably want a
pigment but that in its nature is gonna
be heat more pigmented so yeah I'm not a
fan of that the next warm tone neutral
palette I will not be picking up is the
morphe 35o 2 palette I have only
purchased one thing for morphe ever it
was the captain lights collaboration I
do really like that palette I've been
tempted by the Jaclyn hill palette I
know I said it's permanent now though so
I have all the time in the world to
decide plus it's being sold at Ulta so I
know how to deal with morphe which is
nice anyway this toilet just is like
it's the same thing but with like some
really really red and orange shadows
like what I think that the morphe style
of having just so many shadows in a
palette it's like the way that they do
it it's just they look like the Browns
are the same color like they're so
slightly different that they're not
really gonna translate on the eye
um yeah I know I'm just not even tempted
I don't care how cheap it is I would way
rather pick up something from Juvia
splays I'd rather pick something up from
coloured raine I'd rather pick something
up from like color pop hello so yeah no
I will not be buying that palette next I
want to talk about a product from Becca
and it is a like gradient highlighter
let me tell you exactly what it's called
gradient glow is pretty close okay this
retails for $38 which is already just so
freaking expensive I have ended up
decluttering so many of my Becca
highlighters I used to have so many I
had like the rose gold I had champagne
pop but none of them match my skin tone
like I can really only use moonstone I
don't understand why they came up with
this like this is just so boring to me
it's like turning into Benefit Cosmetics
or something where they're just like
repackaging their same crap I believe
it's all shades you've already seen
before just all put in one palette and
you can squirrel them all together or
use them separate but the strips are so
tiny you can't really use them separate
so the amount of colors that work for my
skin tone in particular are very very
slim I honestly just feel like if you
really wanted something from Becca when
it comes to highlighters just like buy
the one color that's really gonna look
great on your skin and use that yeah I'm
not feeling it I feel like it's a tiny
bit gimmicky it looks really pretty in
the packaging but like no no way I think
I have like four more products to talk
about next I wanted to talk about this
benefit product since I just like
totally bash benefit but this is the
benefit complexion estep palette it's
just my same complaint with benefit that
I've had for a really long time is they
just like keep repackaging their same
crap and like selling it in kits and
selling it and blush kits it's like dude
come up with something new this is all
the same and I'm done with it
like why would I buy this it reminds me
so much of like the influencer
collection where they literally just
resold their same products with like
influencers on the packaging I don't
know if I just don't have that
big of a connection someone but there's
no way in hell I'm gonna go rebuy a
hoola bronzer because I have someone's
face on it um not gonna happen
like I just don't think that was a very
good move on their part but I would love
for them to come out with some new cool
stuff something that's not gimmicky
something that actually is great and you
can keep adding to your line and going
on I'm okay with them not coming out
with a lot of things like they can come
out slowly but I'm repackaging the same
stuff over and over I mean in this
palette alone there's hula and hula Lite
which the whole point of both of those
is that they suit different people so ya
know I'm not a fan next is something
that I'm kind of sad I won't be buying
but it's the Kat Von D and divine
collaboration that's coming out it's a
little eyeshadow palette it won't be out
till like February but once the insight
was revealed they're just not my colors
greens and blues
they aren't something that I gravitate
to I have enough of those in my
collection that I don't use enough so
there's no way I can justify getting
this palette I hope the formula will be
really awesome and for anyone who loves
those colors I hope you'll enjoy it but
it's something that I can't justify
buying and I don't want to buy because I
know I won't use it all right next is
another eyeshadow palette this one is
from senti Beauty now I was so excited
about this when they were like showing
pictures of it and the more I see
swatches the more I see reviews it's
just like I don't want glitter Stoppers
I didn't want the Urban Decay moon dust
palette and that's essentially what this
palette is and I don't know I thought
there'd be more sparkle maybe in person
there is but from swatches which is all
I have to go off of at the moment I'm
just not feeling it there's no way I
would spend the money on it the
packaging is really pretty I really love
the lip gloss that I've gotten from
Fenton beauty but I'm not gonna be
buying the eyeshadow palette and I know
that in four months I'll be so happy
that I didn't spend the money on it just
because it was holiday and limited
edition in the last like kind of
collection that I probably won't be
buying anything from is the Gigi Hadid
and Maybelline like collaboration I
think the packaging looks really pretty
I love that like baby millennial pink
that they have going on super trendy
super cute I did watch a tiny tiny piece
of takis video and the
primered it wasn't really working out
and then when I saw the jetsetter
palette it's just so bulky and so big
and just like it's just ugly like
nothing about that's inspired nothing
about that is like like first off
there's no way in hell Gigi is using
that for itself let's talk about that
like yeah Gigi in her like Chanel bag is
pulling out this Maybelline no it's not
happening that's not happening and
that's something I'm having a big
problem with I feel like lately if
you're gonna make a collaboration with
something I'm all for it let's do it
let's be inspired let's create some
awesome stuff but if you're gonna do it
you should probably create something
that you would actually want to use that
you would actually use I don't know
maybe I mean I guess people just want to
make money and there probably will make
a ton of money off of it but for $30
like that's the other thing what the mmm
no honey no that's way too much money
$30 for like an ugly pal it just looks
ugly it looks so bulky and hideous hate
it hate it too much like there's nothing
about it that I want and then I think
the lipsticks look cute the eyeliner or
whatever lip liner looks cute but I
probably still won't pick those up so
yeah not really feeling it my little
rant at the end here I just really wish
collaborators and influencers would
create products that they actually would
use and if they can't create that with a
brand then don't take the collaboration
I think if they stopped pedaling crappy
crap on us me maybe would like actually
enjoy and want to support them but I
feel like we've been duped a lot and not
in a good way with all of the different
collapse that have come out and I really
just want I just want genuine people
that are genuinely talking to us about
things that they actually like that they
actually enjoyed are creating products
that they actually use it's not the
first time they're using it on camera
they aren't doing it because they're
getting paid X amount of dollars per
palette sold they're doing it because
actually freaking like us they want to
put it something out there that they
love and you know create something
amazing is it too much Thomas is it I
don't know anyway that is everything for
this anti Hollie I hope you guys enjoyed
thank you so so much for watching let me
know in the comments down below what you
are not going to be picking up and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
