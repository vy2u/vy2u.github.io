Lauren this is going to be a halt and i
know i just did a whole but this is all
stuff that i got while i was in Arizona
kind of black friday shopping some of
this isn't even black friday it's mostly
just stuff I got in Arizona which
happened to fall over black friday too i
will say that i do have some color pop
stuff coming in the mail so as soon as i
get that i'm just gonna do a dedicated
video to that i did order two different
orders but let's just get into the stuff
that I bought and I'll show you it and
you guys can see what it is as we go I
thought I would mention my coloring
books first I bought four different
coloring books these were at walmart I
believe they were seven dollars for the
three and four dollars and change for
this one so the first one is a cat one I
couldn't resist I wasn't expecting to
get this one the other ones I was like
I'll get all of them but we were just
walking down an aisle and I saw this and
I was like I'm getting it's under five
dollars it just has tons of pictures of
cats on it I really like it i'll show
you the 1i colored although i don't know
why i'm not proud of it since i gave up
and didn't finish coloring it I just
thought the blue would be a good idea
but then I got into it and was like this
is a horrible idea have you guys ever
done that with stuff like arts or you
know making decisions like that you're
like crap I just ruined it at the end
anyway um yeah I got back horn book i
will leave everything listed down below
in case you're interested i also picked
up these ones these are all disney ones
and they're all like different themes so
this one is disney villains it has
villains from all different movies in it
I thought that was so fun there's even
like the ratatouille guy this one's like
a little weird though but I thought that
was so fun and I just wanted to pick it
up I thought seven dollars for these was
pretty reasonable since they are like
Disney to this is Disney animal so tons
of different animals really the cats on
the front from aristocats are what
pulled me in since that's like my
favorite disney movie some of these are
like hell coloring pictures so like they
really want you to die by the way they
designed these like the Freak it's gonna
take me seven years to color a pig's
face but yeah I picked that one up and
the last one was the first one I picked
up from the stack and this is Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland
I just this is the one I was like I
don't care I want this one for sure
really cool um I think I'm gonna have to
pick up a few different methods with
these coloring books than my markers I
just feel like they're not gonna do it
as much justice as may be colored
pencils or just other forms of coloring
so I'm going to have to look into
different coloring utensils to use on
those I think that will suit him better
I'll stick with the arts-and-crafts kind
of theme I went to the dollar store
while we were there and they had so many
sticker options it took me I have a lot
of strength not to get all these
different ones but these are the ones I
picked up so these are just like robots
and then these ones are Christmasy I
don't know where I'm going to use them
and Sam was like one how many coloring
books do you need Lauren and I was like
I don't care what you say I'm getting
the damn coloring books and then the
stickers too i don't use a ton of
stickers but i just love them i don't
care i have a whole organizer for them
so yeah I got some stickers I believe
everything else is kind of like beauty
related in some way so we're done with
that type of stuff just to get these out
of the way these are some cotton squares
my true intention was to get the round
ones that are a dollar from frys but
they were not a dollar at frys and so
just the price of cotton squares has
gone up and I just need to live with it
I also got some stuff from octal e so i
will be doing a full review video once i
get using these but I picked up some
stuff from skin term is how you say it I
was really interested in this brand when
I saw them come on octal e because their
skincare items but they're actually
affordable and that's what I really like
I feel like there's a lot of like no
name skincare brands out there that
charge an arm and a leg and it's hard
for me as a youtuber to want to really
use those products because i wouldn't
spend the money like I can't expect you
guys to just take my wording go for it I
was kind of sad because I didn't get
accepted for the whole line i only got
accepted for three out of the five
things and the other two things were
like the things i really really wanted
so i'm potentially gonna buy them still
just because they are such a good price
we'll see I don't know yet if I find
someone's like code I might just do it
because I really wanted to try them and
then I
can kind of review everything at once
but um anyway this is the eye cream it's
the ultimate eye cream and this has like
hyaluronic acid in it I have been
enjoying it since i've been using it but
i will be doing a full review with more
details and everything coming up another
thing that I picked up was the smart net
cream and I thought that I would just
try this out I feel like I creams and
neck creams or something that are very
expensive in line they're usually like a
hundred dollars sixty dollars eighty
dollars and up so I was excited to try
this out and this this is a bunch of the
freaking face mask I got 10 of them in
here and these are like a jelly you know
like the scary ones the Jason ones I got
this because I want to try the whole
line in general and so I was like shoot
one of the three I got was the mess so I
won't be testing this out to let you
guys know how they are but you guys know
how I feel in general about these types
of masks they're just like you know kind
of claustrophobic for me but anyway i'm
gonna try these out these of the snail
jelly mask from scad erm again there
will be like a full video letting you
guys know about those ok something I
picked up on black friday at target this
is a candle and this is just from
Chesapeake Bay I coulda sworn that I
lied said I would never buy a canna from
Chesapeake Bay again because it didn't
smell good like it didn't burn and do
the scent but I did it the candles were
all buy one get one free at target on
black friday I couldn't resist the price
so I got some other things like gifts
and stuff but this is the only one I'm
gonna show you cuz other people watch my
videos this is autumn leaves and the
reason I got this this smells almost
exactly exactly like Mingo beechwood
from Bath and Body Works which is one of
my favorite candles and they just
stopped making it they never make it
anymore and this smells so similar to it
which is weird that mango beechwood
smells like autumn leaves but you know
I'll take it so I just got the big
handle i'm excited to burn this I hope I
pray that it actually smells at my house
but I probably won't burn this till
after Christmas but I love this I'm so
excited to burn this just a few more
things while in Arizona I decided to
pick up a palette by the balm this is
the bomb a petite palette and I had seen
pictures of this but I was not
interested by those pictures this is
what it looks like inside it says eat
your heart out and I remember thinking
like oh my gosh have to fit your brush
into those but you know the bomb they
would never do that to you with
packaging they are so thought out with
their packaging I absolutely love that
you get the cuteness it's still useful
but you know you don't have to live your
life like that if you don't want you can
go to normal normal style I went to
cosmoprof which sells the bomb and so I
got this half off it was like an impulse
buy i swatched it and i decided to get
it it's okay I don't necessarily like
recommend it I'm not hating it but it's
definitely not as good as a lot of the
other palettes I've been picking up
lately I'm still testing it out and
trying it I kind of feel like this is a
high-end version of the maybelline's
blush nudes palette for me like i enjoy
it but i could understand why someone
wouldn't like it but I can also
understand why someone would like it I
don't know it's okay we'll see if I
change my opinion on it the more I use
it while we were I cosmoprof I decided
to pick up a few things for my hair as
well as my kit like my hair kit I really
like everything I got actually so the
first thing is the puff me and this is a
volumizing cloud missed if you've ever
seen the volumizing powders this is what
this is but in a spray form which i
think is genius it's so nice so i don't
know let's see if the cloud shows up on
camera oh yeah there goes some genius
has figured out how to put that powder
into a spray form so you don't have to
put it on your hands you can kind of
spray where you actually wanted and i
love it i really like those volumizing
powders to give texture i used this in
here to try to make my four hairs look
like seven up at the top of my head
today so i really do like this i highly
suggested and I think it's just so
useful and practical to have it in this
kind of container the next product that
i bought for myself is the ken red dry
texture spray and i absolutely love it
i'm using a rescue one right now I don't
like it this is just so much better I
feel like you need so little product to
get to the same place I just have really
been enjoying it definitely gives you
some texture gives you kind of that like
gritty feeling not dirty but you know
enough texture so you actually have
something going on hi Lisa
just really enjoy this and then for my
kit I picked up the kenra volume spray
number 25 this is their most popular
hairspray and I picked this up because
one of the women i do makeup on Katie on
my show she loves Kendra so much and I
had Sebastian and she always wanted her
kenra so I decided that once I ran out
of that I would just pick up the Ken
Roth and I'd have it for her and then
just use it in my kit I'm gonna like the
Sebastian but I was I was ok with trying
something new so we'll see how this goes
it also came with a little mini which
I'm so happy to have in my set bag so
yeah I'm gonna be probably using this on
set the next 12 days so we shall see how
much I like it we're almost done guys
only a couple more products well at the
dollar store I picked up another one of
these wet and wild brushes this is the
large concealer brush I really like
pavel brushes for my kit in my real life
I don't use them on myself but I just
find they work really well to lay down
product and then I can kind of blend him
out with Beauty Blender or whatever i'm
gonna do so I thought this would be nice
it really like the size of it for under
the eye and I'm excited to try this out
and then I picked up 2 concealers while
in Arizona I just thought that they
would be a better price there so i
picked up the enabling better skin and
this is in 10 ivory I think this is the
lightest shade I had the shade light
before which is a little too dark in a
little too yellow toned so I'm hoping
this will work out I've really been
enjoying the foundation so I figured I
would try this out and I also have the
powder too so maybe we kind of see how
they all work together as one I don't
feel like I ever have done that where I
bought like everything from the same
range and then you know I had to pick up
my maybelline fit me this is my favorite
concealer I am on the last couple of
uses on my other one so i wanted to get
another one i've decided that i am
totally fine with picking up a couple
concealers at a time because I go
through concealers the most out of any
product may be that in brows that's my
hall I feel like this hall is kind of
random but definitely stay tuned for the
colour-pop hall to come I cannot wait to
get that stuff in the mail I was so
excited to see them do some different
deals for black friday and whatnot so
I'm excited to share those with you and
share my thoughts on them and I'm just
excited those are like some fun new
things i'm excited to get in so
hope you're having a wonderful day guys
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
