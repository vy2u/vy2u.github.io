Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
talk and I'm excited about this one it's
kind of going to be the second part in a
three-part series of a tube talk I did
one on PR and that was all about how I
ran my channel my thoughts on PR and
whatnot this is going to be about
affiliate links and affiliate codes and
then I'm gonna do one on sponsorships I
feel like they kind of all get lumped
together and it makes sense because it's
all different ways of like making money
/ getting product but I feel like they
are all different and I kind of have
different feelings about all of them so
I figured I could definitely talk about
them long enough to make them their own
separate videos so I'm gonna leave the
pr1 link down below if you haven't
checked it out along with the tube Talk
playlist so tube talks are series that I
do just to talk about different topics
in the beauty community on YouTube
anything I'm just like feeling like I
want to like have a discussion about and
that's what this is I want to get your
guys's side I want to talk to you guys
and tell you guys about how I feel I
feel like I try to have an in-between
look at things I want to understand what
people are doing this isn't trying to
judge anyone and specifically with this
series I just want to say up front that
I'm not trying to bash a Creator who
does something differently than what I
choose to do on my channel when it comes
to PR and sponsorships and affiliate
links and affiliate codes everyone can
do what they want they can run their
channel how they want and I totally
respect that that's something that I
love about YouTube is that as a creator
you can put the content you want up on
your channel you can run your channel
how you want to and I think that's great
for me it was always something that was
important to kind of know where my
ethical boundaries were my moral
boundaries were what I didn't want to do
what I felt comfortable with and so for
me through all that thinking because
trust me it was a lot I've talked to Sam
about this stuff so much and even now
I'm constantly kind of checking myself
against what my own kind of rules are I
guess for myself and what I feel
comfortable with just to make sure that
I'm continuing to do things that I know
100% that I feel great about I don't
want to do a video or have an affiliate
code or do a sponsorship that I feel
like kind of icky even a tiny little bit
I'm just it doesn't sit well with me so
for me having
these rules and just thinking about
these things and being prepared for when
other opportunities might come is just
really important so in this video about
affiliate codes in affiliate links I'm
gonna be sharing with you how I kind of
run my channel what you can kind of
expect to see from me and then what I'm
probably never gonna do and kind of my
thoughts on it and why I think that way
as with all of these videos I would love
to know your guys's thoughts in the
comments and I think I have enough I
just wanted to mention my makeup really
fast I do have some like bold freckles
going on I am testing out the Wet n Wild
flights of fancy and so with my first
impressions today and I've got a film I
don't have time to refilm this and I'm
not sure how I'm feeling it but yeah
we're gonna keep going really fast I'm
also gonna link a video that I did about
PR and sponsorships in affiliate links
in the past so that is going to be down
below if you want to know how I felt
about a year ago I'm so sorry about all
the noise basically I feel very
similarly if not the same as I did in
that video
except for again I mentioned John Cook
in and I do not suggest checking out his
channel so anyway let's refer to the
notes you know how it goes let's just
start off with what I like to do on my
channel so when it comes to affiliate
codes and affiliate links I do not take
brand specific affiliate codes like a
more fee code let's say that's just like
a very big example of this type of code
where it's a specific code to me and not
only does it give you guys a discount
but it also gives me a kickback or a
commission of that sale we'll get into
why I don't like those types of codes in
a little bit what I do have in my
description box are magic link so I
believe the magic links website linked
down below it's always in my description
box but the reason that I do like magic
links is because you can put in links
from so many different websites so many
different products and link them and you
make a small Commission I wrote down
some of the different stores on their
beauty stores and the commission that
you potentially could make so right now
Sephora is 3.2 percent Nordstrom is 2.9
percent Beauty licious 3.8 percent and
Ulta is 2.6 percent so that isn't a huge
percentage 3% is not an insane amount of
money to be making off of a sale so I
like that that it's not super huge
there's not this huge incentive to be
linking specific
from specific websites at least not for
me personally I like that I can link
products from all different brands all
different websites I can do a blush
video and link all the different blushes
and I'm not really showing any loved
specifically to one brand in any
specific way for me at least with this
system I'm not falling into a trap of
potentially suggesting a product because
of the Commission I can potentially make
because I'm basically making the same
Commission off of everything with magic
links there's kind of like three
different options that can happen when
you put a link into the kind of like
generator that creates this short it
says like magic ly link the first thing
that can happen is when you put that
link in magically says basically this is
not a compatible thing we don't have a
way to link this website so in that case
I usually use Google shortener so that
it's just a shorter link just so my
description box isn't super messy
I'll see you only get so many characters
in a description box so I like to just
keep it as like short and simple and
sweet to the point so I will use a
Google link to do that the next
potential option is that you will put a
link into magic links and then it'll pop
out a link that is shorter but there's
no way to make Commission so it's not a
store that's in any way involved with
magic links you're not going to make a
commission you just get a shorter link
and you can also see like if anyone
clicks that link and then the third
option is that it's a partnered retailer
with magic links and you get the
shortened link and you can make
commission through that link so those
are the three different ways so just
because someone has a bunch of magic
links in their description doesn't mean
that every single one of them is
necessarily giving them commission I
know that's at least the case with mine
if a link is able to be shortened
through matchup links I just use it
because it's just one site and it's easy
to do but not all websites give you a
commission so like for example
colour-pop doesn't I don't think
makeupgeek does like Kylie cosmetics all
of those so if someone's linking
something from those brands and they're
going to those specific web sites
they're not making a commission on that
at all just so you guys know so for me
when I link products in my description
box the number one goal for that is for
ease of you guys to find those products
I used to not do any linking in the
description box because it takes so much
freakin time if you do a video and
you're talking about 20 products you
to go to each of those websites find
that exact product and then link it down
below so it just takes extra time and
when I first started it was just not
something I was not interested in but as
I grew so many people would be like hey
can you make sure you link this or oh I
really wanted to find this and I
couldn't or whatever so as I grew I was
like okay I should probably start doing
that I'm not like a next level I feel
like I you know should offer you guys as
much information as possible including
trying to fill on my description box as
best I can
so one of the ways that I kind of
enticed my own self to do that because
it is a lot of work it's a lot of extra
time on the back end that isn't the fun
part it's not the creative it's not
coming up with ideas or filming I
thought that I might as well if I'm
going to link it use a service like
magic links where I can potentially make
an income it's very passive in my head I
consider it passive selling like I'm not
trying to make you buy this I'm not
telling you like definitely go buy it
click the link below I have it there if
you want to find this product you can
click the link find the product and at
least see what I'm talking about and see
how much money it is and maybe get some
different statistics on it and then of
course you can always not purchase
through that link and maybe save it to
your loves list and buy it later or be
like oh no it's not something I want
it's just easy for you guys to find so
that's the number one reason and then of
course it has that tiny bit of incentive
at the end that oh I can potentially
make a little bit of money if someone
does decide to buy through my link for
me personally I never go through and
link specific items because there's a
higher percentage or cashback or
whatever to that thing I usually link
whatever comes up first in a search
result honestly because it's just easy
and fastest between Sephora and Ulta I
tend to lean towards Sephora because I
tend to purchase more from Sephora so
it's just a website that's easier to
navigate for me usually I've purchased
my own item that I'm talking about from
Sephora so I usually linked back to
Sephora
so that is why I usually pick Sephora
over Ulta it has nothing to do with like
the money back because honestly I've
made not very much money from my magic
links like I'm not trying to be
ungrateful for the money that I have
made but I know I've been doing the
magic links for Atlee
I think I want to say almost two years
maybe and I think I just hit over like
about $700 total and a lot of that is
pending Commission because it takes a
long time I think between a purchase it
takes like 90 days for you to get that
money into your account or whatever or
into your bank account and then that has
to reach $50 before you can even get
paid out so it's a slow process there's
no get-rich-quick scheme here just so
you guys know yeah so over two years
making 700 ish dollars I mean don't get
me wrong of course
anyone's gonna take 700 hours over not
$700 but it's not like this really
reliable income something that I'm
really like oh you know like oh if I
push this I'll get more money this month
like definitely nothing like that for me
so I just wanted to be very transparent
about what match blinks is how I use it
what it does I would still link the
products if I didn't have magic links
like I do if I do a Google shortened URL
but I just think why not if I can make a
tiny bit of Commission you know I think
that it's nice for the amount of time I
do spend especially since it's not
something that I'm like hardcore trying
to sell to you guys so yeah that's kind
of my thoughts on the magic links thing
it's kind of like Amazon affiliate where
it's like there are so many products on
Amazon you're not tied to a specific
brand and that's something I'm really
focused on is like not tying myself to a
brand and I feel like brand specific
affiliate codes can tend to make that
happen again we'll get into that a
little bit more other kind of like
affiliate links or referral links I
wanted to talk about those as well
because I do have some of those in my
description box too if you go to the
bottom of my page it says like other
links and I have one for octal II I
think I have one for boxycharm I have
one for Influenster and I think I have
one for magic links and so those are
referral links so I'm not making any
like money necessarily off of those
links for me the difference between
those and like an affiliate code are
that anyone who signs up with the
website whether it's you or me you don't
have to be an influencer you potentially
could get a referral code to send your
friends or to your family and so I just
put those again in the description box
because if you want to use my referral
code awesome like I appreciate it but
again it's not something that I push
it's not something that I sell most of
these websites like for boxycharm
I don't get any like cash
there's not like any way I could like
pay my rent with someone signing up
through that link instead I get points
which I then can redeem for products
which for me I'm like if I can get some
points then I can potentially get
products to review here on my channel it
kind of just all goes back into my
channel so for me again because I'm not
really pushing those it's kind of this
like really passive thing there down
there if you want them but if you don't
totally fine with me you totally get it
and I don't feel weird about those at
all so and then the only other thing
that I kind of do on my channel that
kind of looks like a potential affiliate
code if I would send something from a
brand and they happen to give me a code
again that I am NOT attached to in any
way in the sense of making any money
from it of course I want to like show
that to you guys and ladies know about
it so if a brand reaches out and they're
like hey we'd love to send you some
products and also we can get you on as
an affiliate I'm like awesome I'd love
to try the products out I can't promise
you that they're gonna be featured in a
video I can't promise you that it's
going to be a positive review like I
review things honestly lht things very
inspired on my channel so I can't
promise you anything but if you want to
send through for me to test I'd love to
test them out as for the affiliate
program I do not do affiliate programs
at the moment but I would love a code
for my subscribers if they could save
some money so I do want to get a code if
it's something that you do want to try
out at least there's a code and you can
save some money but I don't want to make
a kickback because you use that code in
any way so I do put some codes for
discounts in the description box and
then I think the one that's the most
frequent in my description box sometimes
through octoly which is a kind of like a
site that connects influencers with
brands that want to send out PR I talk
about obstinately my PR video so if you
want to check that out I'm not going to
go into it but recently brands have been
including coupon codes for you guys to
save money and that we can include in
our description box so I'm not making
again any Commission no money at all
maybe octal is but I know I'm not and so
with receiving that product you leave
those in the description in case you
guys want to try it out and get 20% off
or five dollars off or whatever the code
is so those are kind of the things that
you can expect to see on my channel kind
of the reasons why I do it you know I
want to kind of go back into this idea
of passive selling something that I I'm
not a big fan of is like having my
channel like to sell you products like
I'm
to talk about beauty I love beauty I'm a
makeup artist I want to have my own
brand so I'm not opposed I get that
everything needs to like for business to
work and whatever like people buy things
and there's an exchange of money but
when it comes to my channel I want this
to be a place where I can talk about
products however I want to I can make a
creative video ideas that I'm inspired
by and I don't want ever for a main
reason I'm making a video to sell you
something but with that being an
influencer or having a lot of people who
watch you and look forward to your
reviews and trust your opinion I cannot
deny the fact that because I say
something positive or negative about a
product that is going to have an effect
potentially on whether or not someone
decides to buy or doesn't want to buy a
product so no matter how much I am maybe
not being like always hey buy this buy
this if I give a review or say oh my
gosh this product is so great I've
really been loving it that might be
enough to really sell that product to
someone else so even though my intention
might not be to sell things I understand
that just the nature of having a video
and talking about products and you know
having a large audience potentially
could sell products just because you're
talking about them anyway I hope that
makes sense that's just my idea of
passive selling and kind of how I want
to run my channel overall my main goal
is did not sell you products and to make
money that way I like making money
through Adsense it's like my main source
of making any money off of my channel
I've never done a sponsored video up
until this point but again we'll get
into sponsored videos and the last
portion of this tube top kind of
miniseries yeah and if I can make some
money through selling that I feel
comfortable doing then I'm fine with
that but it's not a main goal of mine
it's not something that I'm trying to
like up the ante on or get involved with
and these are the reasons why so let me
tell you about why I don't like
affiliate codes and some of the reasons
I feel uncomfortable about affiliate
codes I know there has been a lot of a
lot of talk about affiliate codes in the
last like two years or so I mean with
the rise of morphe I know I've already
mentioned that but you know there are so
many videos you've seen them where it's
like morphe morphe morphe morphine more
fees my morphe code
or if you code and again I'm not trying
to shade anyone who uses morphe I don't
think that more few products are
necessarily bad I don't think that
they're just products that people
are selling to you because they're
making money I don't think that's all of
it but I think something that I always
wanted to kind of protect myself from is
just the humanity of it all right we're
all people and the whole reason that a
brand is going to get you onto their
affiliate program where you get a code
and you can make a commission is because
it incentivizes you to want to talk
about those products more right let's
say you're gonna do a video talking
about your favorite blushes and you know
you get a ton of views and all of that
and there are brands that you have
affiliate codes for you might be more
tempted to talk about those brands in
that video over maybe some other brands
that you didn't even if they were at the
same level of goodness to you if that
makes sense again I'm not saying
everyone does that but that's just
something that I always wanted to
protect myself from I feel like maybe at
the beginning you might be like no I'm
not gonna do that
but as you see the kickbacks rolling in
as you see the fact that you are making
money why wouldn't you want to talk
about those products more you know every
time you mention your morphe code that
about X amount of people going by
however much product and you make X
amount of dollars like of course you're
gonna want to make money and I just
never wanted to put myself in a position
where I was even questioning myself as
to why I was promoting products or why I
was talking about products and videos I
just kind of want to cut that off it's
not something that I need it's not
something that I really want my channel
to become about and I feel like even if
it starts off kind of innocently it's a
slippery slope to go down and I think
that it's easy to then now you're kind
of always talking about morphe right
because well their brushes are the best
and you're not necessarily trying out
other brushes that maybe are just as
good because why not talk about morphe
brushes you like them a lot and you can
get money off of them so I'm just gonna
talk about morphe why I try out
wet-and-wild why try out other
affordable brushes when morphe is just
fine and you get money from it so that
was always something for me another
thing is I don't want to be closely
affiliated with a brand again where it's
like you guys are questioning why I keep
bringing up Kat Von D or why I keep
bringing up I don't know Sigma or all
these other brands I'm not even saying
that they all have affiliate codes I'm
just
saying I just never wanted to be super
tied to a brand in that way where my
means of money is like directly coming
from them through me selling product for
them I worked at a beauty shop before
I've sold products before that store
specifically did not work on Commission
which I really liked because I
definitely didn't want to do Commission
but I don't want to go back to that like
I'm not here to sell you stuff I'm here
to talk to you guys about things I'm
here to give you guys information
hopefully be a little bit of
entertainment and that's it if you guys
want to purchase things based off of
like what you guys like and you know
based off of maybe some of the reviews
I've given that's amazing I'm glad I
could help you with that but I'm not
here to basically be someone at a
counter saying oh my gosh you need this
oh my gosh you need that like that's
just not what I wanted my channel to be
and so I feel like there's no reason
then for me to even have these affiliate
codes and be associated with these
brands like I'm working their counter
and like I need to talk about this brand
here and here and mention it here and Oh
check out my code in the description box
another reason that I personally don't
like the affiliate codes is because it's
just weird to me so this is a situation
right a brand reaches out says hey we'd
love to send you some free products and
we'd like to get you on the affiliate
program and you're like okay I'd love to
try those products out so you get them
so you don't pay for any of those
products but I don't feel comfortable
necessarily getting those products for
free and then being like oh my gosh
they're so good guys you should
definitely buy them and then making
money off of you guys buying them even
though I've never spent my own money on
it like there's just something kind of
weird about that and then as the new
releases come you keep getting all the
new releases for free and then being
able to be like oh yeah definitely guys
you should buy these and then you guys
are continuing to buy them I just feel
like I have no skin in the game and I'm
making so much money I don't know I just
there's something about that for me that
personally feels weird and that's what
this whole video is about this is how I
feel and how I won her in my channel and
how I knew I would feel comfortable
talking about products and I knew I
wanted to create a system that I felt
comfortable with that I felt good about
because there's a lot of like bad things
that can happen or a lot of things that
are kind of sketchy and I just didn't
want to be involved with it I never
wanted to question my own
morality when it came to suggesting
products talking about products
reviewing products or anything like that
when it came to my channel and kind of
going back to that passive selling for
me when you were constantly being like
oh there's a code down below definitely
check it out if you want to you know get
this blush or whatever save some money
when you're constantly mentioning your
codes and you're constantly mentioning
that you're affiliated in your whatever
I just feel like that's active selling
it again that's something I always
wanted to avoid on my channel I'm not
necessarily trying to sell you stuff
again I want to give you useful
information for you to make your own
decision and obviously even when
someone's mentioning their code it's
still the consumers choice to buy things
for sure 100% it's just not something
that I really wanted to do on my channel
and I want to mention here like similar
to stores I think that you can sell
things and get a commission and it can
be a positive thing like it's something
you really do personally enjoy and it's
not something bad that definitely can
happen obviously channels do that there
are a ton of channels who use affiliate
codes that I watch and that I trust and
that I enjoy but I think that for me it
was just something that I could see so
easily going downhill so fast I think
just being a human obviously it's easy
to want to make more money and I just
didn't want to put that temptation in
front of me so that's where I cut it off
and then overall with affiliate codes
and kind of I think just because there
was so much backlash there were so many
people who weren't being transparent
weren't being open for me it was just
never worth it for me to make that small
Commission in the short term to lose
credibility with my audience and to lose
credibility with myself it's just not
something that to me is worth it I have
had opportunities to become affiliates
in different programs and it's just not
something that I think is worth it when
it comes to you know my my connection
and my relationship with my subscribers
I never want you guys to think that I'm
mentioning something just to make money
off of it
and something I do want to mention and
maybe I should just make a whole tube
talk about it it's like I don't think
there's necessarily anything inherently
wrong with making money online or making
money through social media or through
YouTube I just think that for me there
are certain boundaries I like to place
on it that I just know and I feel good
about the paycheck as it comes in later
on and I don't feel like I sacrifice
anyone
anything to get that money and that's
like my biggest goal with my channel I
mean with when it comes to these larger
opportunities I want to be very
thoughtful with them I want to be very
selective with them for me there's
nothing that's come along that has been
big enough or good enough that I feel
like hey this is an awesome opportunity
I know that I'm not doing anything wrong
and maybe it's different than what I've
done in the past but you know I know
that it's great or whatever potential
opportunity that could come along and
change my mind nothing like that's
happened so there's no reason for me to
even make you guys question my
credibility at this point at all you
know what I mean so these are my
thoughts currently obviously I feel like
as you change and as you know
circumstances change and as new brands
come along I potentially could change my
mind maybe I'll have an affiliate code I
don't know but at this point it's not
something that I'm interested in with
the opportunities that I have had and
you know I want to mention to like for
people who do use affiliate codes and do
you make money getting that Commission
it's like how much is that really
hurting someone I don't know is it
really hurting anyone am I thinking
about this way way too much probably
sometimes when I think about affiliate
codes and affiliate links and making
money and I think about how successful
the huge youtubers are like Manny and
Jaclyn and laura-leigh and all these
people who have morphe affiliate codes
and it's like well who are they really
hurting yeah they mentioned morphe all
the time and yeah some people don't like
it but obviously they're making a
ton of money and who's losing out me
right like I'm losing out because I'm
not gonna do that are they really doing
anything that evil obviously it's still
the consumer who's deciding to purchase
this stuff I mean obviously people are
somewhat satisfied I don't think morphe
is just this evil brand I don't think
that they just have products that
they're like literally you know tricking
and like being evil to everyone I don't
think that's the case with morphe I
think they're just blown up I think they
are overhyped because of the fact that
they get Commission and there is that
incentive but I think overall I don't
think you're gonna just like hate
everything if you buy a morphe palette
or morphe brushes you know but like
sometimes I think about it and it's like
having the stance that I do have like
basically just hurting myself in a lot
of ways because I'm not going to be
at extra money I'm not gonna have those
opportunities to make money and
potentially grow in that way but you
know at least for me right now that's
just something that's worth it to me
again to keep my credibility and just to
keep my channel the way I want it to be
without any of the keenest without
feeling guilty without feeling weird in
any way and again everyone has their own
boundaries on what makes them feel
uncomfortable and what makes them not
feeling comfortable and I think that's
great as long as you're sticking to that
with your own channel or as a consumer
with how you want to purchase from
people I think that's great just to know
why you're doing what you're doing and
have like resolve and you know like
purpose behind it why are you doing what
you're doing and so for me it's a lot of
thinking and I know this is a long video
talking about this topic but I just
wanted to share with you guys some of
the things I do on my channel when it
comes to affiliate links and affiliate
codes I'm so sorry about all the noise
I mean I've purchased things with other
peoples affiliate codes when I am
looking to buy something online one of
the first things I do is look for a code
so that I can save some money so I don't
think that they're entirely evil I don't
think that anyone who is talking about
codes is evil I don't think people that
are making money from codes is like it's
not necessarily a bad thing it's just
not something that I want to necessarily
start on my channel at least not now
it's not something that I'm ready to
like handle or deal with or anything
like that there's not a brand that I've
just loved enough to want to do it and
yeah I think that's kind of where I want
to keep my channel at least so far I
want this to be a fun neutral ground
where you don't feel like again I'm just
here to sell to you because that's not
what I want my channel to be and I don't
consider that my job on YouTube is to
sell you guys products so I think that's
everything for this video I can't wait
to hear what your guys's thoughts are
down below and I hope you guys enjoyed
