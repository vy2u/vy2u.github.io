it's Lauren today is going to be a
highly requested video this is going to
be a kind of tutorial and talk through
of how I color my brows and use products
to have colorful browse most of you guys
that have been subscribed to me for a
while know that I enjoy doing kind of
more like out there looks I'm not going
to call them crazy because to me they're
wearable but I like looks that are more
fun and more creative and incorporate a
lot of color and one of the ways I like
to do that is by coloring my brows with
powders or glitters or colored mascaras
there's a lot of different ways today I
thought that I would just show you the
way i feel like i'm mostly color my
brows which is kind of an ombre look
using powder but i did want to show you
a few different products you can use to
color your brows you can get creative
with it do whatever you guys want it's a
fun thing makeup washes off so you can
easily take this off and try something
new or do it have fun look in the mirror
and then take it off 10 minutes later
it's not permanent so I encourage you
guys to have fun and try different
things go out of your comfort zone and
see if there's a look that you didn't
think you'd like but you actually love
once you put it on your face as I said
there are a lot of different products
you can use to color your brows and
there are a lot of different ways that
you can then use those products to make
your brows colorful one of the ways is
using a colored mascara these ones are
from NYX they have a ton of different
colors and I do really like these I
think these are really good for like
ethereal looks this isn't going to give
you as opaque of a look unless you have
really really bushy brows and it can
clump up depending but I have definitely
done my eyebrows using these and have
really enjoyed the look so I suggest
these ones specifically i do find
sometimes these are hard to get out of
the brow so just make sure you have a
really good makeup remover and that
you're just gentle let it soak a little
bit and then you can work it off but I
do enjoy these quite a bit especially
for the brows next I love glitter as
well so after you put on any type of
color that you want on your brows you
can add some glitter or accents in so
many different ways but glitter liners
are one of the easiest ways to do that
these are two different ones one is from
urban decay and the color baked and the
other one is from Sephora and this one
specifically is in the color VIP gold
these are just easy because it's already
glitter that's suspended in a gel
like consistency so you don't have to
worry about fallout you don't have to
worry about really anything getting
glitter on some of your brushes and then
contaminating everything since glitter
can be a bit of a nuisance but it's
worth it these are just really great
options you can also use loose glitters
and put them like put glitter glue in
your brows and then do it that way lots
of different ways once again I just
thought I'd mention these I thought I'd
mention really fast as I just thought
about it you can also color your
browsing like an eyeliner if you want
depending on formula sometimes those can
be creamier than actual brow product so
just keep that in mind but that is also
a fun way I have done my brows silver
ones using a silver eyeliner and that
was really fun and now for powder the
way I'm going to be showing you guys how
to do browse today I'm going to be using
the two-faced peanut butter and jelly
palette just because I've been enjoying
that and that's what I used on my eyes
today so I thought it'd kind of be cool
to do a look essentially using this
whole palette but in a more
non-traditional way I know a lot of
people use this pop of color like on the
lower lash line and stuff but I'm gonna
use it in my brow stick powders are a
really great way to build up the opacity
that you want so you can depending on
how pigmented the powder is do something
really soft and really like ethereal I
use that term a lot that's my style but
you can do something really pigmented
and bold but you can also do something
more light and airy and like wispy so
that's why I like powders I just feel
like I can control powders the best so I
wanted to say to i'm not saying i have
the best browse ever i'm just showing
you how i do my brows i have gone to
school for makeup but browse every
single day for me are a different
situation that's just how it is for me i
have techniques that I like to do but
honestly i switch up my brows all the
time how dark they are how light they
are how feathered they look all of that
changes almost on a daily basis so i'm
just going to give you a roundabout way
to color your brows using powder i hope
you guys enjoy and again let's let's
just get into it for a brush I'm going
to be using this one I got this off of
coastal scents like years and years and
years ago this is a very stiff angled
brush and it is quite thick I don't know
if you guys can kind of awkward I'm so
sorry it's
quite thick it's not super thin and I
like that because I can just get my
brows and faster I can just hold more
product on my brush this is just my
preferred way I also like that it's more
like dense and coarse hair because it
doesn't it's not as flimsy I feel like I
feel like it just stands up better this
is just what I'm used to using and what
I enjoy so I'm going to just dip my
brush into the purple shadow I like to
tap off the excess just because it you
will get fallout sometimes and I like to
get as little of that as possible I like
to start on the bottom part of my brow
and I am going to be doing more of an
ombre look and I've never used this one
in my brows before I always switch it up
once again I don't know how pigmented
it's going to be so I'm just gonna work
with just this shadow if I feel like I
need more i'm going to bring this one in
if I just want a little bit more of a
punch but usually I like to keep the
most the pigment at the inner corner and
then I like to keep this part dark and
i'm going to fill that in with an actual
brow powder and then I just like kind of
fade it in the middle so it's more ombre
looking and I think some people think
like Oh a shimmer powder in the brows
but you're already going colorful and I
kind of like a shimmer powder or even
glitter powder in the brow so you don't
have to keep that kind of rule of thumb
with colored browse just to let y'all
know
you
I usually like to go to about the arch
of the brow with the color and then I'll
kind of overlap with the other color
from about here and then only have that
color the dark color on the outside just
to let you all know and I thought I'd
mentioned to I don't know if you can
tell a difference but like this front
portion of eyebrow looks different than
the rest of my brows if you're really
really looking and that is because I
don't actually have hair there this brow
is like shorter than the other brow so i
have to like elongate my brow and so
sometimes it can just look a little less
dense there because it is less dense
there that is just something I've had to
deal with some brow pencils work better
on skin than others so that's something
you can work with but that's just part
of it I'm I'm not someone who takes I
try to make it the best I can but I'm
not going to spend like seven hours
trying to make it look like the other
side if it's just not working I just
like let it go sometimes you're not let
it go it looks really settle on camera
at least in my viewfinder hopefully when
I go back and edit it won't be but it's
really subtle right now I kind of like
it but in person it's not a settled
nearly as subtle as I feel like it looks
on camera now I'm gonna take this brow
quad you guys have seen this a million
times this is like the brow quad that
won't die which I'm not upset about I do
enjoy it but I've had it for so many
years I'm gonna take the actual like the
darker color I just like a more defined
outer portion and that's why i usually
do the color on the inside because I'd
rather have my tail really defined than
have this really dark and then this
colorful I find that you just lose that
definition especially because I like to
go with like hot pinks a lot and since
hot pink isn't as dark as like my
regular brow color then that it just
looks better to me personally so I'm
gonna be taking this like almost like
it's darker than this one I don't know
the more ashy cool tone shade and I'm
just gonna be putting that first in the
tail and then kind of again mending it
and blending it into the purple shade
I'm telling you it's really not that
hard I definitely think if you guys fill
in your brows every single day you will
have no problems trying to attempt this
honestly that's kind of it I know it's
not Oh a ton I don't spend a ton of time
on my brows I try to make it as quick as
possible another thing I wanted to
mention that i didn't mention at the
beginning is i did already fill in my
brows and the reason I do that is
because I basically have no brow color
my brows are very very light super
blonde and I find that if I just go in
with straight color they're just not as
defined as I like and I also find that
having a product down already on hairs
and on the skin helps to adhere the
powder to my face better than if I just
go in on fresh hair and skin so with
both of those I just find that this is
better for me if you have dark brows
already I suggest just playing around
with it and seeing what works best for
you maybe you could go in with like a
clear wax first just to kind of have
something for to stick to if you're
finding that regular eye shadows or
powders aren't sticking I just want to
throw that out there though as a little
tip and also reason why I already came
on with my eyebrows done because that's
how I do them I do my eyebrows and then
I go in with the color afterward if you
have any fallout just like you know wipe
it away I don't think I really do um but
yeah I'm gonna wipe it away okay and the
last thing I always do no matter how I
do my brows unless it's glitter because
I don't really want glitter in here but
this is Anasazi of Beverly Hills clear
brow gel I love this this is my favorite
brow gel works really well keeps your
brows on all day long and I find that it
just helps maintain the color especially
to like you can see it I mean I'm not
trying to hide it um this part it'll
just keep it on there better than it
what have I itself so i don't have to
worry about it like running away i hope
this was a helpful like tutorial / talk
through for you guys I did
get too close up on my brows only
because again I think it's really it's
not like a super technical look you
definitely can do it and i also have
really light hairs on my brows so i
don't really pluck my eyebrows that's
just me it hurts and I don't feel like I
have to so I just draw in where I want
my brows and so it can be a little messy
up front oh I'll to see that necessarily
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know if you try this out
down below and I will see you in my next
video bye guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
