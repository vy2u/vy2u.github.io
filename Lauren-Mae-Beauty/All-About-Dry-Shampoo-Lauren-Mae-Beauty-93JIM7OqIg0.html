is going to be a video that starts a new
series here on my channel this series is
going to be focused in on different
topics each different video so this one
is all about dry shampoo oh my next
one's going to be all about sanitizing
products and as I go I'd love for you
guys to leave suggestions in the
comments for different videos you'd like
to see for me this one was requested
here on my channel a while ago so I'm
sorry it took me a second to get this up
but I really wanted to do some research
also I had a lot of dry shampoos that I
wanted to try out and I've tried out a
lot of them and I wanted to give you
guys my real opinions so let's start off
I will talk about dry shampoo just in
general what it is what I do with it all
that type of stuff because I talked
about dry shampoo on my channel all the
time it's my best friend I love it it's
great my mom even loves it now which is
like a big thing for her because she's
wash your hair every single day dry
shampoo is used in your hair um I'll
show you guys my tried-and-true this is
my Battiste but it comes in a bottle
like this it's like an aerosol and there
are powder so it doesn't have to be in
this but most are formulated this way
and you would use this product in like
second day hair even in your first day
hair it just depends on what you want to
do this product is designed to suck up
the oils on your scalp and in your hair
so that you can kind of have that bouncy
on oily hair again so how I tend to use
this is I will part off sections in my
hair and spring it in and do that all
across my head and then I'll give it
time to kind of soak into my hair as
well so I usually do that before I start
doing my makeup I'll put dry shampoo in
my hair and then I'll do my makeup and
then by the time that is I'll massage it
in with my finger tips really work that
powder into my hair so that it can soak
up that oil and by that time I mean with
Bautista it's a media but by the time
the dry shampoo should have soaked up
the oil and you should be like able to
wear her down or however you want to
wear it another way that you can use dry
shampoo is you can also put it in the
night before you're going to wear hair
so say it's the end of day one for your
hair and then you decide to spray it in
go to bed and as you toss and turn and
all these things at night it'll soak in
and when you wake up your hair won't be
as oily in the morning that's also a way
to do it I think that's a great way to
do it especially if you have darker hair
that is a case with some of these dry
shampoos it leaves a white cast so you
are spreading powder into your hair or
you know depositing powder into your
hair so that can leave a white residue
if you have really dark hair luckily my
hair isn't that dark it's usually quite
blonde so I don't seem to have an issue
with that but I do know that that is a
big issue with a lot of people the best
way to combat the gray cast is to just
make sure you're really not over
spraying the dry shampoo into your hair
as well as really working it in brushing
it through massaging it in letting it
soak in so that you don't have that
problem I think that's all I have to say
about dry shampoos let me see it's just
an amazing tool if you won don't want a
shower or if you just don't want to wash
your hair is often I think at this point
most people know you shouldn't be
watching her every single day you can't
strip your hair of the oils and natural
things your body needs but depending on
your hair type and how much hair you
have like I have very thin fine hair my
hair gets oily insanely fast so it's a
great way for me to be able to keep my
hair healthy and not wash it every day
but still be able to get multiple looks
and we're out of each washing I hope I
hit everything on that so I'm gonna go
into the many many products that i have
and kind of just give many reviews of
all the different dry shampoos that i
have here with me that i've tried out
and just kind of let you guys know what
I think about them and which ones I
suggest the most or which ones I think
would work for which people drugstore
options high-end options all of that
stuff we all knew it was coming this is
my first and most favorite this is
Battiste I get mine at marshalls it's
599 there they always have it at my
marshals so I usually stocked up by two
or three I love this dry shampoo this
out of all the dry shampoos it's
different than any other one it just
comes out in a powder when you spray it
it doesn't come out what so I don't feel
like I have to wait around and really
work it in or do any of that stuff it
just already comes out that way it makes
my hair feel fluffy it makes my hair
feel fresh I don't feel gritty or
more dirty I think it gives a tiny bit
of texture but nothing insane this
wouldn't be one I would go to for
texture it's just kind of the tiniest
little added bonus with it this is my
number one suggestion they do have these
in colored forms if you're really
worried about a great cast you can get
like a brown one a black one and a
blonde one so you don't have to worry
about the great cast if you are ballin
on a budget even if you're not this one
is a great price it's amazing it's my
absolute favorite i love it love it love
it and it's the one I definitely suggest
you to try especially for your first one
or if you feel like all these dry
shampoos have been really bad try this
one if you haven't I love this one it's
the best you guys have seen in my
empties like 700 times this is my next
favorite dry shampoo I've ever tried
this is the core on chlorine don't know
how to say it this is the Quran dry
shampoo this is a really nice dry
shampoo it is pricier I believe it's
like in the eighteen nineteen dollar
range so again I would still go with
Battiste but if you want to try this one
or if you can get it cheaper or have
points to use or something where this
works out better for you definitely try
it I do think this one works nice I
don't think that this would give you as
much of a grey cast as Bautista would so
that is a benefit of this product if you
have really dark hair and Battiste
hasn't worked for you I would try this
one I think it works really well it is a
little bit more like a wet spring when
it comes out but I find that it still
does dry like eventually soak in and
like the powdery sounds really bad but
when I see powdery I just mean like it's
fresh and not oily so I definitely get
that result with this I love I do love
this one I probably won't repurchase it
unless I have a really good deal on it
or something just because it is more
expensive but this is a really really
good one now we're getting into the rest
of them I know that sounds bad but
honestly i'm super picky when it comes
to dry shampoo because i love Battiste
so much so they have a really really
high standard that they have to meet for
me to really like them so we'll just go
through them this one is from Bosley
this one is a volumizing dry shampoo
this is a very wet formula again it
doesn't leave a white cast of that is
something that's a positive about it I
don't particularly like the effect of
this dry shampoo it just doesn't work
that well for me and I wouldn't
necessarily suggest it the only reason i
would suggest this one is that it
doesn't have a loom in a minute all of
the other dry shampoos that i have here
to show you how to loom in a minute it's
part of i think how they formulated and
it's kind of like the same aluminum same
situation as it would be in a deodorant
so that is something that you know you
should take into account this one does
not have that in it so if that's
something and I concern for you maybe
you would want to try this product let
me know in the comments down below if
you know of any other dry shampoos that
don't have a loom in a minute because I
would love to try those out and see if
there's something that would work for me
because I would prefer to not use
aluminum dry shampoos but I do think
that's a really good positive for this
product it also is going to help with
hair loss and not like clog the follicle
or anything like that so that you aren't
suffocating your follicle and then
leading tear loss so if hair loss and
the aluminum is a really big concern for
you and you still want to try a dry
shampoo this might be something for you
but personally I just wouldn't buy it
for the effects of a dry shampoo it
doesn't work quite as well to me as like
Batista's so it's just not worth my time
look I need something that's gonna work
immediately so anyway that's kind of my
like weird review on that this is a
similar kind of review this is the
United 7 seconds refresher this is using
clay in it and you have to shake this
product up see I'm shaking it but not
until you hear that ball moving around
do you want to actually use it in your
hair because this has the clay in it and
you don't you want to make sure the
product is super well mixed up before
you start spraying it or you'll end up
having product in here but not having
any air left in the can so just a little
tip on that one this is a very wet
formula as well but again it does not
leave a dry cast you could spray this on
your black you know shirt and you
wouldn't see any type of residue so if
that is something that you are worried
about you could definitely try this one
it is pricier its unite so it's a luxury
brand product I do think that this one
even the Bosley one if you don't have
really greased hair you just need that
tiny bit of refreshment maybe like it
pick me up I'm halfway through out the
day or something like that maybe these
could work for those
I just find with my hair it gets quite
greasy and by the next day I need
something that's really gonna like
blasted the grease away not just kind of
you know kind of do something maybe if
you don't get very greasy though this
could be something for you it's just
again not something I will repurchase
and definitely something I'm gonna have
to kind of work through because I'm
always going to want to use Battiste
over it I'll talk about the rest of the
full-sized ones that i have this is the
Dove dry shampoo I ever purchased this
one a couple of times I honestly don't
necessarily love this as a dry shampoo I
like this as a texturizer so this is
something i'll use on my first day here
sometimes in my second to here with the
different dry shampoo to really give
myself some volume if i'm going to be
putting my hair up in a ponytail or if
its first day here and i kind of want to
have that like poof going and really
full voluminous hair voluminous
voluminous hair that i will use this and
i do like this i have repurchased it i'm
almost done with it and i probably won't
repurchase this one for a while just
because i have so many to go through but
i do like this one and i do suggest it
as a texturizer again not as a dry
shampoo also just a side note on this
one this has a very strong smell and it
does stay with you throughout the day
it's nice it smells like a dove
deodorant type of smell kind of fresh a
little sweet so if you're really
sensitive to smells this one doesn't go
away so yeah it stays in hair like you
put your hair down and you smell it so
that's just something to say this is the
suave dry shampoo this is probably my
favorite dry shampoo from the drugstore
but it still again doesn't really hold a
candle to me for my Battiste this one
goes on just again more wet first off
and then you kind of have to rub it in
after it kind of dries out and then you
kind of get those effects of that dry
shampoo sucking up the oil again I think
if you just didn't have that greasy of
hair this would work fine for you and
you'd probably really love it I just
have a lot of grease and very little
hair so it almost feels like it's greasy
ER than it really is but this is
definitely a good one this is probably
the cheapest one I have here I think
it's like three dollars or definitely
under five and it's a good price so if
you really want to try something for
really cheap this is the one I would
suggest from the drugstore I think it's
really nice for what it is
it's just not East but I do think that
this would work for a lot of people grey
cast um I'm not sure about how it would
do with the white cast and stuff so I'm
sorry about that i haven't really i feel
like it kind of be in the middle though
because it does feel a little powdery
once you have it in there i hope these
reviews are okay i seriously there's
just so many directions have been trying
out for this video and it's been kind of
insane but I thought if anyone's gonna
try them out I might as well try them
out right okay this is one from Garnier
this is the herbal essence oh no this is
from our blessings this isn't from
Garnier what am I saying this is from
herbal essences and this is their naked
dry shampoo it supposedly says in here
that it's not going to give you a white
cast or anything like that um if this is
okay I think it's slightly below the
swab one I think I like the suave on a
little bit better kind of the same thing
it's just quite wet when it comes out
it's what I use today and I'm just not
wowed by it I don't think it's amazing
so um the smell is okay yeah it's just
okay I don't know if you're not very
picky or again you don't have a lot of
oil in your hair this might work for you
but i love the teeth that's my review of
everyone it's okay i love Battiste i
have three more left so these are all
small sizes and they are all like higher
end brands I got them when I was with my
mom my mom actually picked me this one
up this is the Sebastian dry clean only
refreshing a dry shampoo she bought me
this because she's been into dry shampoo
and this is the one she uses I do not
like this as a dry shampoo I think this
is more of a texturizer than a dry
shampoo I don't think it sucks up any
oil all it does is make my hair feel
like gritty and texture II which if
that's what you're looking for that's
great but I just don't like it it sprays
really really wet so sometimes I feel
when they're really what I feel almost
more greasy than i was when i started
because it's like what looking i just i
do not recommend this product so yeah
that's just me personally I didn't like
this see I'm just go home so if you hear
anything that's why the next one I have
to talk about is the kenra dry shampoo I
thought this one was pretty nice
actually I have a little sticky note
this one has a very strong smell it's
very fruity I kind of liked it but again
if you're sensitive to smell that is
something to keep in mind with this one
this
one isn't powdery feeling but i did find
out it soaked up my oil pretty well so i
thought it was okay for that i'm not
gonna like hate using this up I don't
know again if I would repurchase it
because i wouldn't spend more money for
something that doesn't work very well or
as well as Battiste this isn't one that
gives you a lot of texture so that's
kind of nice I know that some people
don't like when dry shampoos are in your
hair and then you just feel even dirtier
than you did originally so this one
doesn't have that really texture a
feeling which again I can go either way
with as long as it soaks up the oil I
feel like this one would be okay for a
dark hair although it does soak up the
oil it says it's not a powdery feeling I
feel like that white cast wouldn't be as
big of a deal with this so if you have
access to this or a small one or
something like that I think this is a
good high end one to try out it's pretty
good especially if you don't have very
much oil in your hair I think this would
be a good one last but not least this is
the Joey co I'm not going to say it
again because I said it's 700 times
wrong this is the joy instant refresh
dry shampoo I do not like this I don't
think it works at all I just don't like
it I don't know what it even did doesn't
like my hair gritty it doesn't make it
powdery it doesn't take away any of the
grease it doesn't do anything so don't
buy I wouldn't buy this one if you're
looking for a dry shampoo personally
again maybe if you don't have oily
really oily hair it might work for you
but I just found that it just didn't do
anything so that one's a no-go hopefully
these reviews were okay I know they're
so they sound so biased I just love
Battiste and I want something that's
gonna work like the tea store better
than Battiste and if it doesn't then
it's kind of like why do I have it cuz i
feel like the cheese is perfect in price
point perfect and how it works and all
of these things there's not really
anything I'd want to change with it but
I just like trying new products so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know if there's any other
all about type of videos you'd want to
see down in the comments down below I
will hopefully have my next video not
too far away from this one but that one
again is going to be on sanitizing
makeup I think that's really important
and you know if you're going to be
passing on makeup too
someone else or be doing someone elses
makeup or anything like that I think
it's important to just know how to
sanitize it and what can be sanitized
what can't be sanitized and things like
that I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I will see you in the next one I hope
you're all having a wonderful day bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
