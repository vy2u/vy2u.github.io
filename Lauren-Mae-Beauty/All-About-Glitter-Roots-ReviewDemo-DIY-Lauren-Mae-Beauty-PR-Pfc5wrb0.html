Lauren thanks so much for watching today
I wanted to talk about a product I got
from octoly that I'm really excited
about and it is something that's so fun
this is the fun sexy hair glow getter
and this is a root glitter gel this is
from the brand sexy hair you can
probably tell already from the packaging
it's very stylized but when I saw this
on octoly I was so so excited because
I'm someone who loves glitter I've done
glitter roots in the past and I just
think it's so great than a brand that
you can easily find at a bunch of
retailers it's coming out with something
so fun although this is trendy and
something I love I realize that this is
definitely not a product everyone's
gonna like but personally I feel like it
was something that was missing from like
haircare lines I have seen other like
glitter gels but they're from like indie
companies or less known companies so
it's kind of hard to get your hands on
it unless you want to like go online and
all of that so I just thought this is
really cool at the moment I believe they
only have the one shade of this but it's
so pretty it's a purple like holographic
glitter I think it's so beautiful I'm so
excited to try it out I haven't used it
yet but since I've done glitter roots in
the past I I mean I figured it wasn't a
big deal so I'm going to demo how to use
this today and just show you how I like
to wear glitter roots one more thing I
wanted to mention before I start talking
about my hair and everything is that I
love the packaging on this and that's
one of the reasons I think this is
actually a useful product not everyone
has the time or want to get glitter
everywhere and this has a brush tip
applicator so you can easily just apply
this to your roots you don't have to
worry about getting a brush or the
glitter getting everywhere it's just way
more mess free weight easier to do
something just so fun but look really
awesome I just think this is such a cool
look so let me give you a little swatch
on my hand this is so pretty and in the
sunlight this is just going to catch the
light and be absolutely gorgeous and
stunning so first off we'll talk about
my hair I like to do these like space
buns or fun buns I don't know what what
this is called you know forgive me it's
not the best I'm not going to do
tutorial on this on
just like apartment hair in the middle
do the best I can throw it up I don't
even know what the back looks like I
would wear this outside I'm probably
gonna wear it out tonight I'm sure there
are other tutorials and hair tutorials
that you guys can go and check out this
is what I got going on I have really
thin fine hair so it gets a little
tricky to you know make my hair into two
buns it's already hard enough to put it
in one bun so two is definitely a
challenge but I do it anyway I kind of
go for that like messy undone cute look
I might have made that category up but I
like to believe in it so anyway once you
have this down the reason I feel like
this is the best way to do glitter roots
is because you have a nice part I really
think that a center part is the best way
and the best look for glitter roots I
don't wear my hair down much but if
you'd like your hair down you could wear
it part it and down and that would look
really cute too but like if you're gonna
put it straight up in a bun it just
looks kind of weird to put glitter roots
like you know around your head in that
way at least I feel like I haven't
really ever seen it where it looks
really good that way so I suggest a
center part and then next you just go in
with the glitter I mean it's really not
that big of a deal this one's so nice is
you just squeeze glitter gel comes out
and then you're just gonna go and I'm
actually gonna get a mirror I'm just
gonna go in and start putting the
glitter gel at the roots so pretty you
can start off I like to kind of have the
most glitter at the ends I'm gonna kind
of put some on my hand and work off my
hand like it's a palette so that I don't
get any clumps like how fun is that it's
so fun but I like the most dense portion
of glitter to be like at the root line
and then kind of spread out from there
so far my technique I really do think
you should use like a palette and kind
of loop some out on your hand and then
work from there so you don't just
deposit a ton of product and then have
to work it out on your actual scalp and
I just do the front portion like the
portion I can see but you definitely
could do this all the way down the back
if you wanted and this is gonna paste
down the hair
at the roots so just be prepared for
that I think it looks good and on
purpose when you have both sides done so
I'm gonna do this side and speed it up
and I will come back to you when I have
it done
I'm really liking the way it looks the
glitters really pretty I think it
applied really nicely I think my kind of
like shoddy job of like putting my hair
up kind of made it a little crazy so I'm
actually gonna reposition my hair just
so that the poof on each side like see
how this poof is a little bit more like
like up and rounded and this one's like
a little more swooping down I'm just
gonna make them match better and I knew
going in that my hair wasn't that good
but I feel like because this is kind of
pasted down you can just tell a little
bit more and because this is a crazy
look I really want to look as polished
as I can even though it is kind of out
there but overall like the actual
product I think it worked really really
nicely I don't know how much of this
retails for but I used a bit of product
just to do this portion so I think this
is really great and a great tool for
something that's easy let's say you're
doing local art festivals of the season
or something like that if this is just
like an easy product to have on the go
you could apply to your friend to you
it's just easy and and mess free but I
think you would kind of go through this
fast but the color of it is so pretty -
I think they did a great job even though
they only have the one color it's not
too neutral where it's just like silver
or holographic glitter but it's not
something that's so out there or so
specific that a lot of people wouldn't
like it so I'm gonna fix my hair really
really fast and I'll be right back okay
guys I'm back I have like a little bit
more like a Princess Leia thing going on
but I'm kind of digging it it's like a
little bit more contained not so crazy
but mostly I like the way the roots look
a lot better with how this looks
I don't know anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this kind of like it's like a
review slash tutorial and then at the
end here I wanted to show you guys how
to DIY your own glitter gel so you could
do glitter roots or even put it over
your body or whatever you want to do
with it I really do like this product I
think it's great I love the color but
say you want a different color or say
you just want like a one-time-use thing
and you don't want to invest in a
product like this or maybe you want to
just make sure you even like it before
you invest in something I
would just be fun to show you how I did
glitter roots before I got this awesome
product that way you can customize and
make your own stuff at home your own
colors you can add in different size
glitter particles which i think is
really fun too so if you're interested
in that then just stay tuned and I will
show you how to do it it's not that big
of a deal but I thought it'd still be
fun to show you okay guys I'll see you
there hi guys welcome to the DIY portion
of this I'm excited to show you guys how
I like to create custom clutters to do
glitter roots so here are a few things
you're gonna need at first this is just
a gel I happen to have a lot of the
American Crew gel so that's what I use
but you can use any gel you have
obviously it should be clear though so
that way it'll dry clear for this DIY I
also have this red kid metal fix and
it's just a glittery shimmery kind of
hair product I'm using that to give my
base a little bit more pizzazz than just
the glitter but if you don't have that
you don't have to have it I just thought
I would use this I obviously have a
container to make this concoction in and
then these are the different glitters
that I have I'm going for more of a
blue-green kind of mermaid I have some
holographic glitter here as well so this
is just the color scheme I decided to go
with you can do whatever you want and
use different sizes I think that's
really fun too this one here has a bunch
of different sizes in it so I will be
utilizing that I think it's fun when you
can have a bunch of different sizes it
just gives more interest to the left and
then to mix all that together I'll be
using these popsicle sticks but again
you can use whatever you have okay so
first thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna take
that gel I'm gonna squeeze out a decent
amount into the container I like to use
a container that I can easily put a lid
on so that way if I have extra I don't
have to worry about being wasteful I'm
also gonna put some of the red kin in
there as well like I said this is just
gonna give it a little bit of a
different base we'll see what that mixes
out to I'm gonna mix these up now just
to see where we're at so we already have
quite a bit of sparkle and shine
in just this so that's super fun and I
think having this extra layer is just
gonna give more depth and just a more
interesting look to our clitoris now I'm
gonna go in I'm gonna do the holographic
glitter first you can use whatever
holographic glitter you have at home I'm
using cosmetic glitter cuz it's just
what I have but if you have other
glitter I wouldn't necessarily waste
your cosmetic glitter and I'm just gonna
kind of build up and mix my color as I
go so I'm gonna probably fast forward
this part it seems pretty
self-explanatory
so all of those glitters were quite fine
it it looks like just a really pretty
shimmery pace so I'm definitely gonna
want to go in with these other ones that
aren't quite as fine to just give some
texture to it especially this one
and depending on how dense you want this
you can always added more gel or it'll
have less gel so I just starting off
small because if you put a lot of gel in
there and you want something really
dense then you're gonna have to build it
up for a long time it's already looking
so pretty and I'm really liking the look
of this I'm gonna add some silver
glitter in just for that final bit
alright guys that's my final glitter
it's super dense this would be really
pretty you can also use this on the skin
if you want to as well it doesn't have
to just be in the hair and obviously the
options are endless because you can add
whatever color what are you look into
your gel so there's a swatch of the
glitter that I did super pretty these
are all quite small you could always add
in bigger chunks if you had like stars
like bigger star sequins or something
you could also add those in like on top
decorated that way too so really fun I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
this DIY at the end thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
