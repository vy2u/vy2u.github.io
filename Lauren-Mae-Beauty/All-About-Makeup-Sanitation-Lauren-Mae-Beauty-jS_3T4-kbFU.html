Lauren this is going to be my second
video in my all about series and this is
going to be about makeup sanitation I
think this is a really important topic
mostly if you were gonna be doing makeup
on someone else if you're a makeup
artist or you're wanting to be a makeup
artist or even if you're just gonna do
makeup on a friend to keep your makeup
sanitized it's like it's insanely
important because makeup can collect
bacteria even just when you're using it
on yourself it can collect bacteria so
imagine switching that off to different
people and all of that it can get pretty
gross and you don't want to be gross you
want to be clean and sanitary and you
want your clients to have trust in you
and faith in you that you're going to
make them look beautiful with clean
products with proper sanitation
practices I just want to talk about that
this is also going to be helpful if you
just want to keep your own makeup
collection more sanitary this is what
I've learned from school so let's get
into a couple things first your number
one best friend is going to be rubbing
alcohol
I prefer ninety one percent or ninety
nine percent because it's
multi-functional ninety one percent or
ninety nine percent alcohol is going to
help keep everything sanitary and
sanitize your products but it's also
going to be able to be used with alcohol
palettes if you have something under
ninety one percent it does not work on
your palette so that's why I like to
just keep it a standard of that so I can
use it in both ways this is just from
CVS it's ninety one percent and ninety
nine is kind of hard to find so ninety
one it's kind of what's more accessible
to me and that's usually what I use and
I like to transfer it into a little
spray bottle this is actually two forty
four which is like a silicone thinner
but I have my alcohol in a bottle
exactly like this and it's just easy
when it's in a spray nozzle like this
because you can spray your hands let's
say you don't have hand sanitizer you
can spray your hands you can spray down
your surface and wipe it down before
setting out any of your makeup and then
also you can spray down your products
like your powder products pressed powder
products and make sure that they stay
sanitary so I definitely suggest having
like these little travel-size I got this
at Big Lots but you can get them at the
dollar store and things like that
definitely worth the investment
the
alcohol is it can potentially dry out
your shadows and that's something you
don't want to do if something's really
expensive if you're using really
high-end shadows and you're finding that
the quality and the consistency of them
is changing due to spraying them with
alcohol beauty so clean is an
alternative it's going to sanitize the
products but also keep the integrity of
the product intact so that is something
that you can look into I will leave it
linked down below the next kind of just
overall topic before I get into specific
products and how you sanitize them hand
sanitizer is super important I like to
keep like a big one with a pump at my
station so that way I can easily put it
on throughout the makeup application
it's important to put hand sanitizer on
to sanitize your hands before touching
your clients face and I really do think
that it's important to put hand
sanitizer on in front of them so you
might have just sanitize your hands but
if they do not see you I think it's
super important to just keep that trust
it's showing them that hey I know what
I'm doing I'm taking care of you and
there's a reason that I'm a makeup
artist because I know what I'm doing and
I'm gonna make sure that I keep your
your face in my hands and everything
very sanitary and very clean it's also
really important that if you're going to
like touch your face or touch your hair
in between like the first time you
sanitize your hands that you remember to
wash your hands in between that we're
humans and it's going to happen so just
easily you know wash your hands again
right there in front of them and just
try to keep everything as sanitary as
possible in that sense a lot of people
actors models anyone like that if
they're getting their makeup done
it's important for them for you to be
sanitary because their face is how they
make their money and if you're going to
be putting product or your hands or any
type of bacteria or potential bacteria I
mean we can't see germs but if they feel
like you're not clean that could stop
you from getting a job it can also just
give you like a bad reputation so it's
just really important to not only stay
sanitary but to keep the appearance of
being sanitary as well and to make that
a prime focus of the things you do and
how you come across to your client and
the last like couple little things
before starting
you always want to wipe down your
surface area with alcohol and just clean
that area keep it again as sanitary as
possible another thing that I think is
really important is say you have a
product like this this is just like a
cream wheel from Ben Nye and you're
gonna take the lid off right and you
have to set this lid down you make sure
you set this lid like this on the
counter so that way there are no germs
that can get in like you're not setting
it down on a surface where the part
that's going to be like coming as close
contact with the product this is
sounding so bad but I hope you guys get
what I'm saying you want to just keep it
again.i sanitary as possible obviously
this could also catch stuff but you can
spray that down before you screw it back
on if it's not like a really quick
process just to make sure it's as
sanitary as possible so that's just
something like a little tip is just
making sure you're setting your caps up
like that so that way again you're
keeping it sanitary so we'll just start
with like pressed powder products I have
just like a palette here these are the
easiest products to sanitize you can't
kind of double dip I guess you could say
with these if you're doing someone's eye
makeup let's say you can take the brush
dip into a shadow put it on their eye
and then from there I also dip back into
that shadow and continue to put product
on them which that is usually weird like
oh no the big no nose come in but you
can't do that with powder products and
then again like I said before you would
just want to spray this down with
alcohol or the beauty so clean whatever
you have on hand
and that's going to sanitize your
product and it'll be ready to use for
the next person it's the same thing for
a blush I just thought I would show you
you would just spray this down after
using it and it'd be you know let it dry
and it'd be ready to go for the next
person completely sanitized for cream or
potted products like for example this
you're gonna want to use a spatula in a
palette so this products pretty dug out
because I've used it a lot of specially
in theatre but you would just take a
little spatula let me see if I can get
it let me get my spatula palette for you
guys okay so I went in and grabbed
myself so this is the palette I use it's
just from Ben Nye and
then this is the spatula this one has
like two different sides so one side
here is like a paddle and this one's
more pointed
these are super handy I do like using
the pallet for like foundation and stuff
but for like lash glue I honestly use
the back of my hand again I just make
sure that it's super sanitary sometimes
it's just easier to use the back of your
hand some people might not think that's
sanitary but I feel like with the
precautions I take it definitely is
anyway I would just go into here and
take a little bit of the product I
needed from whatever colors and then put
that on to my pallet and then I can work
from my pallet and double dip from there
and then I'm not compromising any of
this product I have seen some people use
cream products and they'll dip out of
here and then they'll dislike I don't
know if they spray it with alcohol or
what they do I personally do not think
that's sanitary I don't like to kind of
contaminate this container by taking
something that's touch someone's face
and putting it back in here so I don't
suggest you do that I don't think I just
don't think it's sanitary and I would
not want to spray down my cream products
with alcohol because that's meant to
like it's very drying and these are
cream products so I just think it your
best bet is to just take some out with a
little palette knife and then put it on
your pallet let's talk about doe foot
applicator so lots of products come in a
form like this and these are not
sanitary after the first use you are
going to when you take this product out
you are going to then put this on your
lips and then put it back into the
container and contaminate all of that
product so if you have ever used
something like this on yourself it is
yours alone and you should not use it in
your kit the only time that it is okay
to use something like this as if it's
brand new
and then the two ways you can kind of
use it as you can I'll put one down you
can take off the top let's say and then
use disposable applicators and apply
that way and then just make sure you're
not taking that one and putting it back
in obviously it would defeat the purpose
or you can take your never used doe foot
applicator and then put that on your
palate and then work from your palate
but yeah these are not sanitary after
the first use so it's just I think that
one's really important as like a makeup
artist that you unless you go and buy
stuff specifically for your kit with
when I suggest you can't be using this
for yourself and then using it in your
kid unless you were then using it like
you would in your kit but anyway things
like this I would just keep separate
same with mascara you're gonna have to
use disposable applicators or if you
have like a spoolie that's like a brush
and you can just wash it then you could
do that as well I really like the
covergirl ones because they come with
just like a cap and so I I just keep the
cap on it and then there is no mistake
of someone accidentally using it or
anything like that because there's no
way to apply this without disposable
spoolie so that's what I do with those
but you cannot double dip you just
cannot doubled it and that is so
unsanitary we all know that with
mascaras so I don't think this one you
guys should know lipstick bullets there
are a couple ways you can sanitize these
you could dip this whole thing into
alcohol and then rub off everything or
spray a tissue with alcohol and rub off
a layer of the lipstick itself and then
apply straight from the bullet that is
one way or you could take your spatula
and scrape off a little bit put on your
palate and then use the brush from your
palette so lipsticks are definitely easy
to sanitize and to use on multiple
people I have a few different lighting
options here so first this one is like a
liquid glitter liner and again once you
use this one time you're going to be
contaminating all of that product so you
can only use this on yourself you can't
use this in a kit once you've used it
once so yeah the same with any liquid
liner again anything where you're
dipping the actual applicator that is
touching someone's face or skin into
back into that product it's done for so
don't use it this is just a pencil liner
so for this one you could sharpen it and
not alone because you're taking off that
product would sanitize it I do like to
usually just spray it down with alcohol
anyway or if you're not going to sharpen
it you can just kind of spray the tip
and then you know pull off any product
and that also sanitizes it so pencil
liners are definitely easy to sanitize
this is a felt tip liner these you can
sanitize but the way you sanitize it is
by spraying it down with
Hall and then I like to rub off the
product and that honestly does not leave
this with a long shelf life after that
because of the fact that you're trying
out call on it they're already printed
or hang out I just don't think these are
that sanitary they're just not my
favorite way if you want to do a winged
liner on someone learn to do it with a
gel liner I think that's the easiest way
to do it on people once you are like
applying on someone else but I think
that that is a good enough way to
sanitize this product if you really
really wanted to continue using this on
someone that is how I sanitize these and
another form of liner I just thought I
would show you guys this one is a twist
up so for this since you aren't
sharpening it you would just take off
that top layer of product like with a
sanitized like tissue or something with
some alcohol on it and then just pull
that top layer off and you would be good
to go with this loose powders I thought
I'd talk about this as well loose
powders once again you cannot dip into
the product because it's a potted form
so you know if I were to go in there
with my brush the first time that
wouldn't be a big deal but to go back
into this product with a brush that it
touched someone's skin it's just hard to
sanitize it so you're gonna spray it
down with alcohol and then let it dry I
mean it's possible but it's just easiest
to just pour this on a pallet or a
napkin or whatever you have and then
just work from that pile same with a
powder like this and then just some
other products I thought I'd show you
these two are ones that are just
sanitary by themselves because you just
pour this product out and since this one
has a pump and this one just squeeze two
there's no way for you to really
contaminate the product inside so I
would just pour these onto my pallet
you're good to go
you don't even need to have alcohol for
these ones to keep them sanitary they
already do that with their packaging I
hope this video is helpful I just think
it's important to keep your kit and your
makeup as clean as possible
to just again assure your clients if you
want your clients to pay you you are
doing them a service and it's not just
putting makeup on their face it's making
sure that your technique and all of
these things that you're doing are worth
being paid for it if that makes sense
you are you hovers
ability to keep your stuff clean and to
just be a professional about your kit
and your makeup and everything that
comes along with being a makeup artist
so I hope this video was helpful whether
you're using it to clean your own makeup
or if you're using it to make sure your
kit and all of that is really clean I
hope this helps let me know if you guys
have any questions down below or if
there's something I didn't cover and I
will try to get back to you and um
that's everything bye guys I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
