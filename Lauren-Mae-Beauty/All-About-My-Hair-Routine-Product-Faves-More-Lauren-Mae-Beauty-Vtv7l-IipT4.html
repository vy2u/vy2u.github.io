learn thanks so much for watching this
video is going to be all about my hair
my hair fair routine anything I use in
my hair in my current makeup routine
video I asked for suggestions and one of
them was like a hair video so this is me
doing that thank you so much for
requesting it this is going to be a
little in-depth so I will leave like
timestamps below if you want to check
those out but I just thought I would do
just like one really in-depth video
maybe a little bit longer talking to
guys about my hair I'm not really high
maintenance when it comes to my hair I
have some Holy Grail products that I
really really like some things I don't
give a about and yeah I mean I have
color here so that's what an aspect to
my routine and everything but I think
that's kind of it that's kind of the
intro I wanted to do so I'm first going
to start off about coloring products
because I feel like that's probably the
most like off the bat you look at my
hair and you automatically know a diet
pink I guess before that though we'll
talk about just like what my hair is
like I have fine thin hair it's
naturally pretty light like these are my
natural roots but I do have it weaved
blonde my mom is hairdresser so whenever
I see her she guides up on for me so
that way my color tape butter my hair
tends to get oily pretty fast but I also
feel like it gets oily because I have
such thin hair I don't have much on my
head to like soak up the oil um so that
kind of sucks yeah overall I feel like I
have very problematic hair because I
just don't have a lot of it me and my
mom joke all the time about the fact
that I have like 4 hairs and I know
that's like a joke but it's also true
like I really don't have a lot of hair
this is it and this is me like trying to
fluff it I am very scared that I will
like lose my hair and have like a cold
isaq situation going on so anyway let's
get into color products now that you a
little bit of background to dye my hair
like I said I do have my mom bleach it
but for the actual color my favorite
product that i like to use is called
viral this is actually a shampoo that
colors your hair when you use it i have
two here but the one i use i don't have
with me is in my shower i'm sorry guys
the one I love is the hot pink that's
the color I used right now my hair right
now is that a stage where I've totally
washed it 2 to 4 times
since initially washing it with the
shampoo so it's definitely faded out but
I absolutely love this this makes dyeing
my hair super easy this color here is
the pastel like pink color wash and then
this one is the pastel lavender the
light pink is really pretty if you want
essentially like this or lighter in your
hair like seriously a wash it pink this
one is really nice it doesn't stain your
hands and it's just super easy the
lavender I feel like is a bit more
pigmented than the pink one it's a nice
I personally just into pink right now so
I only have used this a couple of times
and then I kind of just went back to the
pink because I prefer it the hot pink
again like I said is my favorite but it
does stay in your hands so it to be kind
of careful about that I like to squirt
quite a bit in I will like put it into
my hair and basically do the first half
of my head and then do the same thing
put it in the back part of my hair kind
of like you know get it all together
kind of like saturate what I can wash my
hands as fast as I can and then I let
that sit while I do other things just to
kind of give it the best chance it can
to just permeate all the hairs and you
know just take the strongest have the
strongest pink in my hair yeah I really
like it I think it's really beautiful
super easy quick I don't feel like it
really soon as the shower either so yeah
I'm really into it I will leave links to
everything down below so you can easily
find it I know viral blood being sold
only at like professional things but I
have been able to find it easier online
so I think you can get it if you really
want it on Amazon before I found viral I
was using the ion color brilliance now
this is the color hobby pink I have a
lavender one here and then this one's a
middling I've never used the mint one
you can pick these up at Sally's for
$5.99 I think these are really nice too
they're just not as easy as doing it in
the shower I found that I had to have
like Sam help me and he like absolutely
hated dyeing my hair so I just like that
I can just do it by myself what the
other one but the other dies to do like
in my older videos is the ion and if you
want to bang I'll try that that's kind
of it for dyeing my hair I really don't
do anything else I just kind of like let
it do its thing I feel like I get
compliments all the time like no matter
what stage my hair and like if it's like
more faded and grown out people still
like it if I just guide it super hot
pink people really like it so yeah it
works out I really like
I really see myself being pink for a
while I really love it I guess I'll keep
talking about product so I'm going to
stick with like shower products for
shampoo and conditioner I really don't
have a favorite I've really just been
using what I've had in my collection my
favorite things I've used in the past I
really like the Moroccan oil volumizing
shampoo and conditioner I tend to go
through shampoo faster than I do
conditioner because I don't wash my hair
every single day but what I do I wash it
a couple of times you can really need to
like get rid of product and build up
into different things and since my hair
trying to get oily I don't like to use a
lot of conditioner especially near my
roots but that conditioner for Moroccan
oil in the volumizing line is very nice
I feel like I can put it through my
whole hair and I don't see it weight
down or getting oil reef after I really
do like that I also really like the
bubble and mobile surf the times I use
that I really enjoyed it too so that's
what I suggest absent hair loss products
my husband uses Nioxin and part of me
wants to use it part of me wants to use
other things because I also want volume
and not just like hair loss so that's
something I also suggest we use the
chemically treated one just so that if I
use it it doesn't like you know strip my
color excess this is the one I use you
can also use Bosley that's kind of the
same anyway I thought I would just
mention that ok so right now we're in
the part of the routine wearing out of
the shower and I always like to like
kind of like let my hair towel dry like
wrap it up but before I do that I will
use a tangle detangle spray this is just
the one I'm using now from nuuma I do
enjoy it it's ok but I prefer the unite
one that one is super nice it's like the
seven seconds heaven conditioner I don't
know I will leave a link down below it's
so good it's super good it smells good
it feels great highly suggested but I
like to spray a little bit of detangler
not too much but a little bit and then I
also do use Moroccan oil I love the way
Moroccan oil smells it's so good I just
use like one to two pumps of this and I
will just put it on the ends of my hair
just to make sure that I'm giving them
some moisture I like to keep it away
from obviously my group so basically
from the ears families that I would
suggest Moroccan oil I think it's great
okay so at this point I'm now ready to
brush my hair because although I don't
have a lot of it it tangled like heck in
the shower and I really do need the oil
in a detangler to be able to brush
through my hair so hopefully I don't rip
what I have left
my head I also like to use a wet brush
when I do brush my hair this is a brand
new one just because I was not going to
be disgusting and she's the ones that I
have in my like actual personal use
right now I highly suggest the wet brush
I feel like they're pretty inexpensive
they're like ten dollars and they really
do help like you brush through your hair
without ripping out all your hair and
your hair is the most fragile when it's
wet so you want to be very careful with
it very delicate with it so I highly
suggest a wet brush now usually I will
pull my hair up in a towel do my makeup
get ready for the day whatever and then
once I'm ready to dry and I will send
blow dried if I don't want to air dry
for of organizing product I like to use
the bubble and bubble thickening full
form mousse this is the one I ever
purchased probably it's my third bottle
of this it gives me quite a bit of
volume with not too much products which
I like it's been my favorite one of you
so far I kind of want to try it a few
other ones but I do really like that one
I'll put that in my hair and then I will
just blow dry my hair I try to blow-dry
it kind of like upside down I sometimes
use a little bit of a round brush just
to try to build as much as volume as I
can I like to have it on like a medium
heat setting because I have a sensitive
scalp and I don't like the hairdryer to
be too hot yeah I hope this video isn't
boring I feel like this is so boring I'm
just kind of basic ok so once my hair is
dry I tend to always put it into a bun I
wear bun every single day um not just in
my videos in my regular life sometimes
I'll do space buns which is just two
buns and so one I just do not like the
way my hair looks down I'm very
self-conscious about it I'm obviously
plus size and bigger and then on top of
that having like very thin hair I just
feel like I have to play big old body
with like four hairs on my head and I
just don't think it's flattering so I
just personally I just feel so
uncomfortable I also tend to get really
flushed as my hairs down and in my face
when I like trying to work and do stuff
like I'm just like a no-nonsense person
and just like like my hair up I also
really don't look cute with my hair like
it's also my preference I just think
it's cute
so it will put my hair up but to do that
I like to have a few products to help me
with like texture and volume especially
on first day hair basically the two
products I like to use are a dry texture
spray
one is from Moroccan oil and I really
like this I feel like it gives a nice
texture it also smells amazing but I do
like the unites texturising spray that's
probably my other favorite one these are
just great to help give you some grit to
give you some just like texture if
you're going to put your hair up in a
bun or any type of updo I have such thin
fine hair that it just has a kitten's
and build on itself it just looks flat
to my head so this really helps give me
a little extra volume a little extra
like is it a dream I guess the other
products that I like to use is a
volumizing powder you guys have heard me
talk about lionizing powders a lot I
have two here puff means probably my
favorite just because of the application
this is a a spray so you don't have to
worry about like porn powder into your
hands you can just spray it where you
want it I think this is just so awesome
I like to spray this a little bit
farther away if you put too much in one
place it can be very like sticky in the
sense of like you're going to rip your
hair out of you can't like put your
fingers through your hair type of
situation but I love it for when I want
to put my hair up I'm not trying to put
my hands through my hair it just helps
give me that texture and then this one's
from big sexy hair and it's the same
thing it's a volumizing powder but this
one you just kind of like shaken so you
would just Inc beading and then kind of
put it where you want to they recently
have also come out with like a pump one
so if this is like easier to access this
brand I would definitely suggest like
trying to find that because the spray is
just so much easier I feel like you go
through it faster definitely but it's
just so much easier of application oh my
gosh I just realized that I didn't even
talk about this which is insane this is
the batiste dry shampoo and this is my
number one hair product if I was to
suggest anything to you it would be a
dry shampoo and specifically batiste
I get mine at Marshalls which is the
cheapest place you can find it I don't
care if you are a professional
hairdresser or whatever the cheapest
place to find the chief is at Marshall's
you can get the smaller bottles which is
like the jumbo size but you get the
smaller ones for 479 this one is $9.99
it's like a couple cents different so I
just want the big ones my favorite scent
is a tropical but they have a ton of
different cents they also have colored
ones if you have darker hair this does
kind of leave a bit of a white cap if
you have dark hair so keep that in mind
I guess one suggest that tinted ones if
you do this makes your hair fluffy it
doesn't give it too
Grit sell many dry shampoos I feel like
are essentially like texturizing spray
so they don't actually soak up the oil
and they just give me texture and that
sucks this actually makes my hair feel
fresh it feels light it's so good my
husband uses us now I finally turned in
and this is something he uses all the
time in love I just I love this this is
number one I also love I've mentioned
this so many times so if you are like a
normal like watcher of my videos you are
probably like no Lorentz we know but
anyway this does not have aluminium like
starch or whatever it is in it which I
just feel better about since I'm
spraying this on my head so often I just
love it it's so good number one product
I can't believe I almost forgot to
mention this I just had so much in front
of me and not kind of it for products
like I don't really do anything else for
putting my hair up in a bun I like to
use these really thin elastics like they
have no metal or anything on them I
can't use the sick ones like seriously
my hair is so thin there's no way I
could get it to go around my hair and
secure it because I have to go around it
like seven times so I really like the
thin ones they're so nice they like help
my hair stay perky so I suggest those if
Yepsen hair and then I use bobby pins to
like pin my hair in place to do this
type of look and then last I just wanted
to bring something up because this is
the only other like fun thing I feel
like it really do with my hair like I
mentioned I either do this or I do space
buttons and if you want like a full
fledge tutorial on how I do my glitter
roots I will leave that video link down
below but when I'm feeling extra fun I
like to do glitters I think it's just
such a fun a trend I just love it so I
really only like to do it with you like
space buns because I have that center
part and I obviously don't have a center
part when I have my hair up in a bun
this is also from big sexy hair I got
this from oculi and this is the glow
gutter root glitter if you just want to
like buy something have something ready
this one's really awesome it's like a
purple holographic glitter so fun so
cool it has like a brush tip applicator
which I tend works best if you like
apply on your hand
go in I'm instead of like clapping it on
just straight from the brush again that
toll tutorial shows you how I do it but
I also like creating my own so this one
here is when I created that's more like
fun mermaid blue glitter you can also
use this on your body if you wanted to
as well but I just think this is like
fun so not only do I like my hair to be
pink but sometimes I like the glitter
and that's really the only like cool
thing I like to do is make sure I don't
do like braids or curls or anything I
don't even wear it down but I love to
put glitter I think that's everything I
tried to be really in-depth if you have
any other questions just let me know
down below I hope this was entertaining
or that you learned something and I just
hope it wasn't really boring but that's
everything thank you so much for
watching guys I hope you're having a
great day and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
