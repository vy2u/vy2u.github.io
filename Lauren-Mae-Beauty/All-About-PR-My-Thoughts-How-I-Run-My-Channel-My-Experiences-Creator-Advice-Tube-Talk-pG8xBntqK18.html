Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing a new tube
talk video and today we're gonna be
talking about PR we're gonna be talking
all about PR I know this has been a
pretty popular topic as of recently
especially in the creators that I watch
and I feel like they're kind of in my
similar vein but this has been on my
mind a lot lately so I thought that I
would make a video about it I have
actually made a video about this in the
past it was like PR sponsorships and
affiliate codes so I'll leave that link
down below and that was made I believe
about a year ago and that was before I
had as many subscribers as I do now I
think I had maybe like six or seven
thousand subscribers when I made that
video
besides the watching John cookie and
thing that I mentioned at the beginning
which I don't suggest anymore I will say
that all my opinions are basically the
same I just thought that this video
would be a great way to talk about this
topic with new subscribers since I've
obviously grown a ton since then I want
to just let you guys know my thoughts on
PR kind of like my rules or how I run my
channel and then I also want to talk
about just PR in general and kind of
some more behind the scenes things about
it if you're a creator or you're trying
to get into it or you're just interested
kind of my findings or understandings
about how it works or at least how it's
worked with the brands that I've
received PR from I honestly have only
really received PR in the last couple of
months like that's when I've been
reached out to you by different brands
and so I thought it would be helpful to
kind of like let you guys in on that
information especially if you're a
creator or just kind of wondering how
that works because I'm a very like don't
want to get scammed type of person so
when people email me I'm very critical
I'm like checking the references I'm
like you know making sure I don't click
links and all that so I'm hoping it will
be helpful for other people if they're
interested in that so anyway that's just
like the long spiel of it all of course
I have my notes because you guys know I
cannot not have my notes first up I kind
of just wanted to talk about like what
is PR because we just say PR so much
that's how I always say it in my head is
like PR like a pirate or like you're a
politician anyway so PR stands for
public
and that basically becomes shorthand in
the beauty community for any products
that are sent for review for
consideration for free they haven't paid
for those items they were sent
essentially as a way for the company to
have marketing to get their product name
out there or whatever it is or their
company name this is not like a new
thing obviously beauty youtubers are
relatively a new thing I mean in the
last like 10 ish years that wasn't a
thing before then but they've sent out
PR samples and things to magazines
before that was how they used to do it
and then also I like to use the example
like celebrity swag bags so at some
party they'll give you like a bag full
of all the stuff that was given to them
for free and they're doing that in the
hopes that that celebrity or that person
will wear those products and get them
some brand recognition it's just a form
of marketing so my personal thoughts on
PR I'm a hundred percent fine with PR I
think that there is a way that you can
review PR items and things that are sent
to you for free honestly I know that
some people don't think that and that's
okay but I know that I do for me some of
the reasons that it's not super
problematic is one PR is just talking
about free product it's not an exchange
of money obviously these goods I'll have
a retail value but they're not you can't
pay your rent with makeup
necessarily and you're really not
supposed to resell the makeup so if you
are doing that that's something that a
brand finds out probably they're not
going to send you any more makeup so
it's kind of like you would be shooting
yourself in the foot if you were trying
to continuously get PR really there are
only so many ways that you can like I
guess make money by selling your PR
doing whatever and those take so much
extra energy and work and honestly if
that's what's happening it's probably
gonna get found out it's probably not
going to be a long-term sustainable
thing and you probably would be able to
tell from the Creator and the type of
vibes in person that they are that
that's happening and that is like the
first thing like if you don't trust
someone that they're giving you honest
reviews a free product or you know they
just have like a shady vibe about them
then just don't watch them and don't
support them so if you're like that kind
of like weeds that out as a problem at
least for me in my eyes
I can see that there would be good
reviews of just free PR because of
potential brand trips and not wanting to
ruin relationships with brands maybe for
other creators that's a thing but for me
it's not because I'm not necessarily
looking to have really close connections
with other brands not into like a bad
way I don't want like bad relationships
with brands I'm not trying to like pick
a fight the grouchy ladybug up in here
but to me like I started out this
channel and I think a lot of creators
honestly I think a lot of craters we all
didn't get PR from the beginning and so
we bought the products we're passionate
about makeup that's why we start up our
channels and so when we get to the point
where we are getting free products it's
super exciting don't get me wrong it it
feels amazing it feels like you're being
recognized for all your hard work which
feels amazing but for me I was fine
without this product I'm fine if you
don't send me any more of this product
I'm not someone who's looking to
necessarily stay on a PR list or
whatever because to me like if I get PR
it's like I think of it as a one-time
thing even if they tell me like I'm
gonna be on their PR list I'm grateful
and Wow oh my gosh every single time and
I'm not like expecting to be on it and
for me if you don't want to send me the
product that's fine if I really want it
I can go out and buy these products
these aren't like limited-edition only
available through free PR means from
companies like no anyone can go out and
buy this if I really want this product I
can go buy it it's not that big of a
deal obviously it's great to get it for
free so your resources can go to other
things for your channel but if I don't
get it for free and I really want to try
it I really want to review it I really
want to talk about it I can go do that
on my channel I know buy it you know and
I'm personally not a super like review
heavy channel so I'm not necessarily
needing the products as soon as they
come out to try to get views that way
which I know some channels are
structured that way which makes it a
little bit different but I am not so all
those like things just I feel like don't
necessarily affect me or how I think
about receiving free makeup okay I'm
getting off a little bit so let me refer
back to the notes okay some positive
things that I think come out of PR is
one you are being sent products which is
so cool as a channel and as a creator if
you are creator it is so exciting you
know it really is
I think one of the things as creators
that we pride ourselves on is being
honest with you our subscribers we're
like a team that's like made it together
and so I know a lot of us I feel even
more pressure on free products to have a
really thorough review not come out with
a first impression like really tell you
guys how I feel about it so I can give
you guys the best information possible
since I've been so lucky to be put in
this position to get these products for
free what's going on sorry about all the
banging I think sometimes I hear the
argument like you would have never tried
that product if it wasn't for PR and
sometimes that is so true like maybe
that brand isn't on your radar maybe you
only have certain funds and your funds
would have gone to all these other
products but that's something I love
about PR is that as someone who tests
out and makes videos and does all that
we can try out products we maybe
wouldn't have normally bought and find
some really awesome products or try to
warn you about some really bad products
and I think that's awesome without it
you would have never tried that product
but since you did get it that way that's
an it's amazing it's so great and it's
not because it was free it's because you
never would have tried that product I
think that there's something really
important that Kaylee said I'm gonna
leave Kaylee's channels link down below
if you haven't checked her out but she
mentioned in one of her videos about how
PR is kind of like this double-edged
sword and I really agree with that you
are trying to strike a balance between
being grateful for products and
obviously it's amazing and you feel
really lucky and you know you're really
happy and appreciative but at the same
time you have to be really critical if
you're not critical of the products if
you aren't you know trying to give out
the best review that you can or if you
want to like give stuff away because
you're trying to keep your collection
smaller or you know just too much stuff
then you look ungrateful some people
love that you get PR some people hate
that you get PR some people think you're
ungrateful if you're giving it away some
people think that you're being too nice
to the brand if you actually like a
product that you get sent for free and
so ultimately you as a subscriber have
to decide do you trust this person do
you think that they're gonna give you an
honest review no matter what and if
that's true then believe that and trust
that and if it's not true maybe move on
maybe find a different channel it's how
they talk about products on their
channel how they come across on camera
isn't something that you like then you
know maybe that's not the right person
for you and don't watch them and don't
support them if they aren't doing what
you think is like right with PR and then
one
positive thing I wanted to mention about
PR cuz I'm like literally all over the
place in this video I wanted to mention
that I think PR is great especially when
it is the full collection sometimes it's
nice that a youtuber can get so much
information up there on the internet for
you so you can make better buying
decisions I think that's a great use of
PR I recently did some lip swatch videos
so that way you guys could see what the
colors of all these different covergirl
liquid lipsticks and lip glosses look
like and I did that because I was lucky
enough to get sent the whole thing so I
thought you know what I might as well
put some just like swatch colors up give
the tiniest bit of information that I
can about the product but mostly just
like let you guys see what it is because
my channel is all about trying to give
you information so that you can make
better decisions and better buying
decisions obviously people have
different opinions on makeup things work
differently for different people but I
want to give you as much information
that I can
and then hopefully that will help you
either decide you do want something or
don't want something if I like it for
certain reasons that may mean that you
like it or that you might not want to
buy it because those are reasons you
wouldn't want a product so I'm all about
trying to give the information aspect
out there and PR is a way that beauty
gurus can try out so many different
products really test out different
formulas against each other and get that
information back to you guys whereas if
they had to buy all that stuff
themselves it wouldn't be as extensive
of reviews or information on different
products and knowledge on different
products so I think there are some
really good positives obviously there
are some negatives but I think overall
when it comes to just receiving free
product I don't think that it has to be
bad I think that maybe some people it's
not necessarily good but that's when you
should make that personal decision if
you want to support that person or not
so I think we're gonna move on from that
I think I covered it as best as I could
and tried to hit all the topics that I
wrote down in my notes next I wanted to
talk about PR hauls because that is
another thing I mentioned in one of my
get ready with me is more recently that
I was toying with the idea of doing a PR
haul and I feel like PR hauls serious PR
I cannot not think that they are very
dividing people love them people hate
them people get jealous of them people
think that the Guru is just being so
flippant with all these expensive things
and I can see those points to me I enjoy
PR hauls by certain people I don't watch
all of them out there but
I do enjoy seeing the new releases in
that way because it is a way to see them
in person not only in on Instagram I
feel like that's where I get a lot of my
new makeup and if you don't want to
watch a ton of reviews but just want to
kind of like see what's coming out PR
hauls are a great way to see a lot of
new releases kind of start your wish
list of things you might want to like
look into more or might want to see what
reviews you want to see on later on so
I'm thinking about doing that on my
channel a lot of you guys like we're
saying that you would like it so many
guys were saying you didn't like it and
then some of you guys were saying that
you'd like more of like a twist on it
and I think what I'm going to be doing
on my channel is I'm gonna be doing like
new in my beauty collection and then
it'll be like PR haul and I'll probably
do them every like month or two or
something like that and then I will do a
PR like rehaul type of thing and then on
top of that I really want to do Kaylee
series where she is talking about PR
products that she would or would not
repurchase with her own money if they're
worth the money would she spend her own
money on those PR products I love that
video concept and so I've been wanting
to do that as well so yeah that's what
I'm going to be doing on my channel I'm
pretty sure so PR hauls are not your
thing then just skip out on that video I
have quite a few other ones so I get it
I get that it's not for everyone but I
like kind of serving you guys to see
what you want to actually see reviews on
what do you want to see me do more in
depth stuff on because it's a lot of
product and to do in-depth reviews you
need a lot more time with it than doing
first impressions and so it's helpful
for me to know what products are
actually peaking your guys's interest
and then also combining that with what
speaking my interest and then making
video decisions and review decisions of
what I want to put up on my channel
that's kind of where I'm going with PR
hauls and I want to point something out
too I know that a lot of people say that
they get jealous about PR hauls and I
get that it is like we're all beauty
lovers and to see someone get so much
free product like thousands and
thousands of dollars worth of makeup and
beauty items that you might purchase
yourself I get that that might be you
know you're envious of that but remember
like this is a perk of this job and this
is a perk of doing YouTube and doing a
blog or doing Instagram and
me if you're not doing that if you're
not putting the work into a YouTube
channel if you're not putting the work
into an Instagram if you haven't reached
that level of success and that's not
something you're even trying to do like
don't be jealous of it because you're
not even in the arena or in the game for
it you know what I mean if PR is
something you want you want to get free
product um I don't think you should
start your channel because of that but
I'm just saying you aren't even doing
any of the steps that would potentially
maybe get you there I can almost see
people that are doing YouTube currently
and doing Instagram and trying to make
it in the beauty sphere that would be I
feel like more reason to be jealous
because you are actually trying to
accomplish those things and all these
other people are getting it over you and
if that's you I hope that you just
continue to work hard continue to like
create good content and I'm telling you
the brand's will reach out once you have
a decent amount of subscribers which
means that people are really loving your
content you're connecting with people
you're going in a great direction you
will get reached out too so I like to
think of it as like some jobs have
different perks you know like if you're
doing beauty stuff you're gonna get
Beauty perks if you work at Sephora
you're gonna get free makeup whereas if
you are working at some company and you
get like game tickets often that's the
perk of that and I'm not jealous if
someone else like that's super awesome
of them I'm not jealous that they get
the tickets I might be like oh man but
it's like a positive jealousy it's not
like I hate you you know what I mean so
I think something I just wanted to know
if there is that people and channels and
Instagram accounts and you know beauty
grooves don't just get sent PR for no
reason they get sent it because they do
a lot of hard work they have a huge
audience there's a lot of other things
that go on behind it and so if that's
something that you want maybe work
toward that if that's like a huge thing
or if you just don't want to watch those
they don't put you in a good mood just
don't watch those videos that's also a
simple a simple solution to the problem
and one last thing I do like about PR
hauls and I think that you know with the
growing rise because this was not a
thing that used to happen people did not
show all the free makeup they were
getting and I think that with PR hauls
there's this level of transparency that
I personally enjoy I like that I get to
see what brands are sending you can kind
of decide what reviews you want to take
with a grain of salt you can kind of
just see how much like how much product
they really are getting and sometimes
that's nice to be able to look at a
favorites video or to look at just
different things with you know you just
have more information to look at a
picture with and I like that I like
transparency like letting you guys know
what's up what's happening in my life
and what's happening with different
makeup whether something's good or bad
if I got it for free if I didn't if I
like it if I don't and I just think that
adds like a level of transparency to
your channel I don't want to like hide
how much makeup I'm getting and I don't
want to feel guilty for receiving PR I
want to be able to show you guys and
give you a good review so that was
another thing I wanted to mention I
think that it's a great level of
transparency so I think that's
everything I wanted to talk about PR
when it comes to like my personal
channel and like my feelings and
thoughts on it talking about like PR and
PR hauls so if you guys want I can do a
video on like affiliate code slash links
and I can do one on sponsorships it was
just too much to put into this video
because I want to go into the second
part about just talking to you about
like different ways you can receive PR
and just kind of letting you know more
backend stuff like that so yeah if you
guys want those let me know down below
so let's talk about how you can get PR
because there are I feel like three ish
different ways that you can receive PR
so one is you can reach out to brand so
if you are a channel or if you are have
an Instagram or if you somehow have a
blog or whatever you're in the beauty
world you're talking about products and
you have a bit of an audience you can
reach out to brands and kind of request
them to send you stuff because you have
a blog or a channel or an Instagram
account every brand is different and so
like pixie and derma e are the only two
that I've ever like reached out to in
that way because they have a very like
easy easy application process I guess
you just put your YouTube in I'll leave
the links down below if your Creator and
you want to check it out but you can see
what they have you can submit your
channel and then they kind of review it
and let you know if they want to like
send you or if they don't so it's super
easy you don't have to like send out
like a
individual email or anything like that
whereas for other brands you can do that
you can go to the contact us and kind of
like contact out and try to like reach
out and kind of make stuff happen for
you so I know some people do that I
don't know the extent of that because
that's not necessarily where I go with
PR I have reached out with the pixi and
the derma e because it was so easy but
when it comes to like other things and
kind of where I've decided I am with my
channel is that's not something I want
to do I wouldn't consider myself a
minimalist at all
I just try to be conscious of the things
that I'm bringing into my collection
that I'm buying with my money and so i
just don't personally want to like reach
out and try to get PR from everyone
I'd rather brands find my content and
reach out to me that way that is more
personal to me and also for me it
personally lets me not have as much
pressure with the products like again
like I said I think everyone can be
truthful no matter which way it comes
but for me I want to eliminate as many
factors that can sway my decision as
possible and I just feel like I would
feel more bad I would still do whatever
I wanted to do but I would feel more bad
to ask a brand to send me stuff and then
basically on all of that stuff
whereas if a brand wants to reach out to
me and send me stuff I'm assuming you've
already seen my channel you know how
things go down I also let you know in
the email but that's how it's gonna go
my channel I'm gonna do an honest review
it's gonna be good or bad I'm not
promising to even talk about it on my
channel but if you want to send it
through awesome and for my channel
that's just how it works for me that's
how I feel comfortable and confident and
happy with receiving PR and and just
again confident that I know I'm giving
you guys the best information possible
while eliminating as many outside
influences as I possibly can and I want
to point out this is not me saying that
other channels shouldn't do this they
should do it my way whatever that's the
beauty of YouTube everyone has a
different channel you're your own boss
you can run things however you want to
and that's what I freakin love about
YouTube and creating your own community
and channel on the platform you can make
whatever decisions and make whatever
marks in the sand that you want to you
and that you feel comfortable with and
people get to decide if they want to
watch you and you can decide how you
want to run it and I love that so that's
not
what I'm trying to say here that's just
how I personally feel comfortable with
receiving PR so that's the second way
you can get PR brands can actually reach
out to you email you say they want to
send you stuff and the third way is kind
of a middleman service so this is
something like octal II I think there
are some other sites but I mostly use
octal II and I know a lot of other
people use octal II and essentially this
is a site that connects creators with
brands and instead of doing like
sponsorships you just basically can go
onto your free stores what they call it
and you can go through products that are
up on the page and you can request to be
sent to those products for review and
you get them for free and you are
supposed to give an honest review of
your feelings on those products which is
why I love octal II they stress that it
is an honest review you're never like
forced to give false positive reviews or
make it overly nice or anything I also
love that they want you to be
transparent they always want you to like
hashtag gifted hashtag honest review
hashtag free like they are not trying to
like hide that you're getting this stuff
for free or that these brands are
sending it out to you for free which I
love it specifically when Erin Oxley you
can just like submit or you can like
leave a little note and usually what
I'll do is like oh I've been wanting to
try this out because what I love about
that is that you're you're choosing
which PR you get so it's like you should
be already a bit excited or interested
or intrigued by these products to try
them out and so all I'm usually I'll be
like oh I'm interested in trying this
product and sharing my thoughts with my
subscribers and that's all I say I don't
say like I can't wait to do this type of
video about it or anything like that
because like for me it's my channel and
I don't know what content I'm going to
be inspired to create with that product
until after I've tried it out and tested
it and I don't want to promise any type
of video to anyone with octal you do
have to put it in a video though like
that's like the one promise you do make
is like yes I will talk about it in a
video but you can talk about it freely
however you want to and that's what I
enjoy unless it says specifically and
then I don't submit for those I only
submit for the ones that I can do
whatever I want with it to me it's just
not worth it like I appreciate the free
product but that doesn't I'm not gonna
like force a whole video around a
product just to get it for free okay so
that was like long-winded but I wanted
to just talk
about the different ways of how you can
get PR because I think that that's
something that no one really talks about
like how does it happen and a lot of
times it is through your email whether
you're emailing out or they're emailing
you moving on to the last portion I
wanted to talk about just kind of more
specifically how each dealings and
interactions go with the brands for
example like I mentioned in the intro
I'm very like skeptical of like
different emails that I get because if
you're a creator you get random emails
from different people all the time and
one of my like requirements now is that
they have to know my name like if you
don't address my name in the email then
you're just sending out mass emails and
it's just not as personal for me so I do
enjoy when a brand actually is like hey
Lauren I know that they've watched my
content they've at least looked at my
channel name since my name is in my
frickin channel title and so I just know
that it's a bit more personal and that's
something that is like a first thing for
me on top of that I like to make sure
that if there's any links that I'm just
going separately I'm checking out that
page if it's a name of someone or a
company I can kind of do some extra
little research before I click anything
or respond and honestly I don't respond
to all the emails I get I just get too
many and I don't have time to worry
about responding back to people being
like no I don't want to do that no I
don't want to do that so I only respond
to things that I am interested in doing
um it doesn't mean that I like hate the
people that I don't respond to it's just
I just don't have the time in the day
and yeah honestly that's what it boils
down to so I will say when when you
first start out and you don't
necessarily have a huge subscriber base
you maybe don't have as big of an
audience
you also get reached out too but it's
more from like individual Amazon sellers
that's something I've had a lot of you
know more like items from China and
things like that and so I don't
necessarily say yes to those things just
because a lot of the times they don't
necessarily fit in with my content it's
not something I'm even interested in and
at this point I have to be at least
somewhat interested in the product or I
have to like know the branding like it's
a super huge name-brand people know
about it it's well known in the beauty
industry those are the reasons that I
would say yes or like want to try
something or if it's like an indie
cosmetic company then I might say yes
and like look into it more but if it's
an item or a brand or something that I
have no idea who this is I have no idea
what this is about I'm not interested at
all I wouldn't at all consider spending
my own money on this I'll already just
like kind of write it off my list
there's just no reason for me to waste
their time in my time in that product
and just have clutter in my house I will
say that like as my channel that bigger
obviously the brands reaching out to me
were a lot different and were a lot
bigger I've mentioned covergirl but I
had the big covergirl box come to me
which is like the most extravagant PR
I've ever gotten it was like the whole
spring 2018 line and so many people got
that box which i think is so cool so
many other smaller creators which i
think is amazing and how that email came
which was a little bit scary for me at
first I like was like I don't know if
this is actually covergirl they send you
a thing and then they want you to fill
out a Google form so if you're someone
who is you know doing YouTube or
blogging or whatever I noticed that a
lot of like bigger brands use Google
Forms to get your information or like
get your preferences or whatever it is
on that Google form so if you get an
email and it's from like a legit brand
and you're kind of made sure that it's
not like you know
sketchy or they're just faking it out
and they send you a Google form that is
normal I did not know that was normal
before I just kind of like risked it and
was like okay fingers crossed that it's
actually covergirl and it actually was
so yeah that is something like just to
look out for because you know just a tip
or like information I guess for you to
know another thing that can kind of
happen is sometimes brands will reach
out that you maybe know of and they kind
of suggest you to do a video idea like
they'll be like hey we'd love for you to
do a video like this or like that and
we'll send out some products and for me
this is where I personally with my
channel have decided like again I don't
want to be forced to put products into
any video I just don't want to have ties
like if you want to send stuff to me
awesome I'd love to try it out see if
it's good see if it's bad give you guys
reviews in my own time and in my own
video ideas but if you don't want to and
you only want me to make a specific
video that's that's fine but I'm not
interested in that
and
when I've had a couple different brands
reach out to me I kind of have this like
it's not canned because I do kind of
change it for every single one but I
always make sure to put in my response
hey thanks for reaching out I'd love to
try these products out but to be upfront
I only do 100% honest reviews good or
bad and I'm not promising to talk about
this on my channel and that just is a
way for me to be like I put that out
there and I'll say but if you still want
to send some things through for me to
try I you know here's my address I'm
excited to try them out or you know to
hear back from me or whatever and both
times that I did that with those brands
they were like oh awesome thanks for
being honest we'll send something out
you know and I think that's what's so
cool about being assertive and having
boundaries which is sometimes really
difficult because it's so exciting and
you don't want to turn down
opportunities but I really suggest that
you kind of just have your own moral
landscape mapped out for you so that way
when you are confronted by different
situations and this isn't a negative
situation by any means but you already
have the tools and know how you want to
respond to those and then it's on the
brand or whoever else is on the other
side of that email to respond with how
they want to and no shade if they wanted
to not work with you or that's really
what their marketing team is wanting to
do with those products or how they want
to spend their marketing or PR budget
but for me I just like having those
boundaries so that I know and feel good
about everything that I'm doing and
that's like a really a big important
thing for me because I'm just a very
honest very upfront person and I just
don't want to have the stress or just I
don't know I don't want anyone thinking
I'm doing anything that I shouldn't or
that I should I don't want any promises
like nah I'm just me and I'm doing me
still so that's another thing that I've
encountered let me think I think there
was one more thing that I had on here
but maybe not I've also had companies
reach out where they didn't have like a
Google Form and they were just like hey
we'd love to actor to the PR list or
we'd love to do whatever I feel like
most of time they're really nice but
they're not super like trying to like
get on you or anything like that I
actually did have a brand specifically
like I said like yeah I'd like to try it
out I'm not promising to do anything
this is where you probably see it but
promising any videos and once the
product was like launched and everything
they were like emailing me every day and
I had to be like hey I really appreciate
you sending this out to me but I never
promised to do any of these things I'm
like get off of my back essentially and
they're like oh sorry so I don't know I
just think like as a creator know that
you have power and that you are a part
of this equation like it's amazing to
get sent PR but know why they're sending
you PR it's because you have an audience
and they know that if you talk about
this product it's going to be marketing
for them which isn't necessarily
negative if I really like a product or
even if I don't it's great to let you
guys know about that but that is what
they want they want you to talk about it
and you have power in that situation and
not to like wield it poorly or do
something bad with it but you know just
know that you can stand up for what you
want to do in a situation I feel like
this video is so long and it's a lot of
information I hope you guys enjoyed it I
think I'm gonna end it here I'm trying
to think of like any other last-minute
PR things I wanted to bring up talk
about my email responses and how I feel
about PR I think the last thing I just
want to like quickly address is I think
sometimes they hear the argument of like
I wish brands wouldn't send out so much
PR and then they could drop their prices
and I think that you know sometimes the
PR packages can be super insanely lavish
and maybe a little too over-the-top and
they could be more conscious of the
environment and like the waste and all
these things for sure I agree with that
a lot but I do also see it as like this
is part of their marketing budget is
going towards sending out these products
to people so that's what they're putting
in they're putting the marketing budget
into marketing these items so that
hopefully they will actually open it and
show it on camera and I get that side
like I get that it's wasteful but I also
get the side of the brand of like
wanting to make something cute and
something that won't you know you want
to open you want to try those products
just like you would on individual
packaging on makeup you know you like
you like the stuff that's cuter you're
more drawn to it you know and then
hopefully it's good inside and also I
don't think that brands would ever
decrease their prices like I don't think
that's how that works
like Tarte is a high-end brand because
they want to be a high-end brand it
doesn't matter
how much their products cost that's the
price point they want to sell their
brand ad they could do all of these
things to cut cost they could you know
stop sending out as much PR they could
stop going on the brand trips they could
do all of that but they're still gonna
sell their products at 20 30 40 50
dollars a pop because that's the price
of their brand like they want to be at
that price point they don't want to be
like a Mac which is more middle range
and they don't want to be drugstore they
want to be at that price point so
they'll just have the margin you know
where they're the profit margin will
just get bigger if they cut down on
those things and again the marketing and
the PR and the brand trips which is also
just PR and marketing it's all a part of
their budget you know what I mean so
anyway I think that's everything I just
wanted to touch on that last minute I
just I get that argument but I just
don't think that realistically it would
even even if they did that I don't think
they would lower their prices because
they want their concealer or their
mascara to sell those prices you know
they want their eyeshadow palette to be
$50 anyway that's everything this was so
freaking long I can't wait to hear you
guys his thoughts in the comments down
below keep it a discussion please even
if you don't agree with me I'd love to
hear your thoughts but there's no need
to be mean to anyone even if you don't
agree with someone else in the comments
