going to be a normal set up I know in my
last video it was a little scary
it was super white you can see I'm
actually just moved to California this
is our new apartment here and it's still
not always set up yet but like I just
got that new lamp at IKEA and I love it
I bought some stuff off of all cosmetics
wholesale recently I did a pretty big
purchase if you guys don't know all
cosmetics wholesale is an online site
that sells like wholesale makeup
high-end drugstore also discontinued
makeup it's a great place I've bought
quite a few stuff off there before and I
just kind of have been looking at the
site recently and wanted to get
especially some concealer so I have it
all laid out in front of me here I
personally like the site I think that
they they sell pretty good stuff some
things can be hit or miss but I feel
like that's just with anything so I
think the discount you're getting kind
of makes up for that one of the first
things that I went on the site to
purchase in the first place where these
Maybelline Dream Lumi concealers these
are both in the color ivory I believe
320 ivory on I got they came in a 2-pack
for six dollars I think $6.99 I love
this pen I think it's great and yeah
it's definitely a staple in my
collection so I've got it got some more
of those I also got two other concealers
both by Maybelline these are the fit me
concealer this is in the color fair I
got two of these as well I've already
opened the one my favorite concealer
ever it's just great these are three
ninety-nine a piece which is cheaper
than I can get them at the drugstore so
definitely a great find also good some
of the lipsticks I wanted to get some
drugstore lipsticks I've been on like a
lipstick Bend lately like I'm usually
not lipstick girl but lately I would
consider myself one I got two of the
Maybelline matte lipsticks these have
been out for a while
I know these are basically the two
colors I heard about them so there's
touch of spice which is just that kind
of Kylie Jenner 90s lip trend type of
color I'll swatch it for you guys super
pretty brownie
good color I'm excited to wear that and
I'm excited that it's mad these were
like I think $4.99 on there again um
it's not like a huge discount from what
you can get online with or in-store with
coupons but it's just easier for me and
plus I know these haven't been like open
in the store
I don't do go on the hunt for them like
with one stores out of it and then I
have two they're like eight stores I
don't know for me it's just easier so
this other color is lust for blush that
is it there this is kind of like a
similar color it's a pinky mauve color
so less brown in it and I'm like super
excited to wear both of those matte lips
have been super in those should be good
and everyone has raved about them I also
got some wet and wild once - I love
their lipsticks I have a lot from the
original and these are like the Fergie
ones these were really really cheap on
there so I got four different colors the
first color that I got is fuchsia nice
duh it's a fuchsia color in the camera
it's looking a little red but it is a
fuchsia color really really pretty
these go on so nice I wish there was
more
Fushigi but these go on so nice so full
color I'm really excited to try these
out this color here is in Fergie daily
I've had this color before but it opened
in my person got on everything so I'm
excited to have it back again this is a
very kind of brown topi nude I really
liked this one I think for the price
it's great another one I got is in the
color Ferguson to crest Cabernet this
one is definitely a darker purple e plum
color like these just swatch so nice I'm
really excited for this one - I want to
get some use out of that before fall is
over or winter is over I think it kind
of looks rebel esque I mean don't get me
wrong I don't have that color so I can't
tell you for sure guys and then last but
certainly not least is bee-bot love
again this is another like brownie nude
color it is darker than Fergie daily and
it is a little more brownish nude so I'm
excited
I'm excited for all of these I think
they're really really pretty colors you
cannot be how that swatches none of them
are matte but they are all cream color
so there's no shimmer in any of them oh
yeah that's stained so stain my hands
something fun that I got were these
lashes by pop beauty I thought that
these lashes would be so cute they're
pink and black and just fun I kind of
was inspired by like these lashes cotton
candy Marie Antoinette yeah that's
that's kind of our going for for this
look so I can we'll see how that looks
I got a blush I've been looking at this
blush online for a long time and I
finally just got it it's by Australis
the blush is in hotties and secrets and
it's a dual blush so it has two separate
colors in it these are both like ma vie
peachy colors these are totally the
types of colors that I would wear they
are kind of like a satiny matte finish
so they're not a hundred percent matte
but definitely no sparkles and on this
one was kind of since of those like ten
dollars which I know isn't that bad but
I think it'll be worth it because the
quality seems nice and the color is like
perfect for what I like these next items
are both from mark G's it just so hard
for me to hold them in front of the
camera these are the Wonder glow blush
and glow and this one is the exotic
beauty face powder mosaic I just saw
these on there and it was I think there
are six dollars for both of them and I
just couldn't pass them up they just
look so pretty so honestly I'm not
convinced of the quality or anything
this is one of that this one is the
Wonder glow blush and glow powder it's
pretty I mean the color on that is super
pretty it's like a peachy color I just I
just like the way they look they are
different than what I feel like they
looked like on this site but yeah that's
what it looks like it's super pretty and
I don't know we'll see I mean even if I
get a little bit of wear out of them I
feel like it's worth it I just I
couldn't know myself I just wanted them
this is the other one let's see this
one's more I feel like like a
highlighter and this one's smaller they
looked like the same
sighs online this is what that one looks
like and then if you open it up that is
what the product looks like
it looks pretty the pattern on it is
super pretty
it's quite pigmented if you can see that
that's just the white part I don't know
if you would use that I mean you'd have
to use a very light hand where you'd be
crazy I'm excited to use it
um I obviously have never heard anyone
like talk about these I just liked the
way these looked on the website so I
thought why not check it out those of
other things that I got on the site were
these Maybelline master eye studio let's
see Maybelline eye studio New York
quads these I think are all limited
edition ones I have been on like I keep
with me so I probably got like 13 in the
last like week and a half because I went
crazy but but I saw these on there they
were only $4.99 apiece which they're
usually $9.99 P so it's half off I
thought I was a good deal this one here
is Barrett buff they're all shimmery a
shimmery whitish color a nude a pink and
then a brown everyone raves about these
like as their favorite formula from the
drugstore so I want to try them out I
really don't have that much drugstore
eyeshadow so I thought I should have
some so I can have affordable options as
well this one's from that same
collection this is nude romance I'm
really excited for that color there it's
just like a more warm brown these ones
are more of like a satiny matte finish
they're not quite I wouldn't say 100%
matte but they are like closer
definitely the other ones are quite
perfect this one is in the color take it
off take it off it just has some really
pretty colors there's a white a black
there's like a purpley taupey color and
then like a dark brown as well another
one that I got here is called olive
martini now I thought this one is gonna
be a little bit more green when I bought
it but it is beautiful this one color
this like that darker one that looks
like it's watch that one is so pretty
it's probably the best color on there
it's like a duochrome
you can see it there
so pretty it kind of looks like club for
Mac again I don't have it but it's just
beautiful it's that you know chili
brownie duochrome this one's really
really pretty glad I got that one and
then the last one I got four seriously
the last one there this is virtually
violent and it's just a purple quad I've
been into lavenders recently like I want
to do like a lavender eye and so this
one here has like a shimmery white a
nice I kind of do a crummy purple color
it has like a purple iridescent to it it
also has a like a little bit of darker
of that color purple and then also a
dark purple if you want I can do like
whole swatch video of just my maybelline
color my studio quads if you guys is
like that I've been super into them so I
think they're I think they're great
quality for the price especially if you
can get them on a good deal the other
ones I got off of Amazon and I got them
all for way cheaper than like the normal
price - well let me know if you guys
would like to see that in the comments
let me know if you like the place up to
see that if we're keeping an eye shadow
this is a cream shadow by Maybelline
it's a color tattoo this one's in a
limited edition color as well this is in
the color lavish lavender again like I
said I want lion guys I've been into
lavender so it's like a silvery lavender
color I just think it'll be nice on the
eye and I really want to do some
lavender looks I think this will just
give the colors like I want to do like a
lighter lavender this will give like a
base for them that's just gonna make
them pop but still be light in color so
I'm excited to use that for the looks
that I have been wanting to do like in
my head last for I shadow I've got some
eyeshadows that I have been eyeing off
their website for a long long time these
are they're called smh beauty it's not
shaking my head it is stars makeup
heaven Haven stars makeup Haven they
came in little clam shells like this I
got seven different color but I did
already take them out of the clamshell
and put them into my Z palette these are
them
in there so pretty I went crazy I did
get some these were all $2.99 apiece
I just wanted to compare them to just
other shadows I have I just think the
price on them is so great I have the
Coastal Scents hot pots and I do have
some of the makeup geek foiled shadows
as well so I just kind of wanted to see
how these compared on the gamin between
those two I have some Akshat us as well
they're all that same size so to go by
color this one here is in the color
squeak it is like a shimmery white color
it's not super pigmented as in like
color but the sheen is pigmented if that
makes sense it's really really pretty I
think this will be great for the inner
corner or you could even use a dozen all
over face highlight I will probably be
using it in the inner corner though I
think it's really really pretty this
color is a really pretty metallic blue
this isn't the color Perry we they are a
little powdery I'll say that but I think
the quality on them is just quite
wonderful this one is really pretty it
is iridescent and has a beard essence -
it almost has like a purpley like shine
to it it's not really picking it up on
camera next I have prodigy this one
looks so so pretty it's like a pinky
silvery I wouldn't say cold but it's
it's mostly pink again a little powdery
it's just really really pretty it looks
kind of rose gold in the thing it
doesn't it's not it's our pinky mauve
colored but I think it'll just be so
pretty for like an everyday an actual
look in the outer corner or if you
wanted to you could do all over people
of it and then do like a darker color in
that crease that's like a color I'm
super into Bulworth I got fee fie fie
fie its fi fi it's like a purple color
it's kind of reminds me of the Caitlin
rose color by makeup geek this one is
probably I wouldn't say the least
pigmented it's just iridescent so it
doesn't come off like full BAM color
it's kind of the opposite of the other
one is like a blue iridescent to it but
the next one is called cracker mm-hmm no
one makes me
this is just a matte cream color I'm
really happy with this this one is just
a creamy like baiji pale white color I
have it's watched here in my hand really
great I mean great pigmentation I'm
super excited this is like gonna be my
go-to brow bone highlight I like a matte
highlight I don't usually do a shimmery
one so I'm so excited you go through
them so fast so I'm excited I have like
a really nice one that I know can just
get the job done
it's pigmented you don't like go over
and over and over again this one I think
it's so exciting this one's called
fireflies it's like this yellowy
chartreuse II um greeny yellow color
it's so pretty and this one is also
quite pigmented that's it's watched on
my hand there and then swatch that was
just like a one-time pass over like
that's not doubled over anything so
pretty I saw that girl shake so do a
video with like this type of like color
and then like a black and gray smokey
eye I think I want to recreate something
like that so I'm excited to have a color
to do that with the last color I got is
flaming oh and it's just this orange II
shimmery orange color so pigmented I
think for $2.99 you cannot beat the
price of these I'm really impressed I
think if I ordered again I would
definitely make sure that I picked up
the rest of the colors are $2.99 I think
the other ones are foreign anyway I
picked up a lot more alive colors these
are clean color femme lipsticks these
are a pack I got a pack of 12 for $14.99
I got these because I want to do like a
dupe video and or a swatching video
review video and then I just didn't know
if these could be potential dupes
colored lipsticks have been totally
popular lately I just kind of wanted to
you know see how these held up where are
these in the spectrum of that and I just
thought for the price there's like a
dollar and change a piece that's so good
I have worn all of these so I'll swatch
some of them I'm gonna do like a
separate swatch videos I don't want to
like swatch them all i guess but this is
in the color jewelry box this is a
yellow one in the color
lightning-struck magic lime happily
after just haffley after not happily
never hold your purple machine yeah I'm
gonna do a swatch video on these and
just like a review I'm gonna do a lip
swatches of them so I'm not gonna go
into detail in this video but that'll
probably I might just film that probably
filming tomorrow I'm off for a week
before I start work here so you know
taking advantage of it I think that's
everything that I got guys I definitely
suggest the website if you guys at least
just go look at it I'll leave a link in
the bottom bar below I think it has
great stuff you can you know find
different brands you've never heard of

like NARS on there and different stuff
