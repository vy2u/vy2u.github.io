Lauren this is going to be a bit of a
declutter video I'm just showing you
guys some things I declared this morning
in one of my previous videos I talked
about how I want to bring more makeup
into my collection maybe shop a little
bit more than I have in the past year
and a half or so even with that that
doesn't mean that I want to just keep
things in my collection that I'm not
using I want to make room for those
items and just make sure that everything
I have I'm really truly loving and using
and am inspired by that's a big thing
for me is like when I look at this I
want to play around I want to do
something I want to create so I have a
little basket here of things that I've
decided to let go of and pass on my mom
is also coming in October to go to
Disneyland with us so I thought that it
would be a good time to pass some things
along to her when she's here that she
can look through and I thought she'd be
really excited hold on sorry about that
that was Sammy anyway let's just get
into the declutter because why not I
have some palettes on the top here that
I'm getting rid of so I'll just go
through those first the first one here
is the lorac afterglow palette and I
think this palette is beautiful a part
of me wants to keep this I do like
colorful shadows I just haven't reached
for this I feel like in my collection I
have better quality shadows in these and
I'll reach for them over this this is
not the same formula as the lorac like
pro formula so they're not a self
they're not as buttery and I just feel
like it's time for me to pass this on
and let it go let someone else use it
this one is like a little bit more
difficult but I think it's really
realistic for me to pass it on I don't
feel like I'll reach for it in the next
year this one is another one
that was hard for me to get rid of but I
decided to pass it along this is the
Stila for Kardashian Khaos
and although I feel like I'm not
necessarily for ton of Kardashian beauty
stuff this palette is really nice the
shadow right here I'm like holding it
over the shadow heart right here is
beautiful it's like a version of kitten
it's not as good as kitten from Stila
but it's just really nice really soft
really buttery I used to like using this
as like a neutral palette I could just
take with me but it's just time to let
it go I don't usually do something like
this if I do it's usually a little bit
more warm and I just feel like I have
other things that I would reach for over
this even though this is a good palette
I don't want to just keep it in my
collection because it's good I actually
want to use it so I'm gonna pass this
along and hopefully my mom can get good
use out of this but yeah that one I just
I like this palette I don't know what it
is but it's time for it to go and the
last big palette that I'm getting rid of
is aqua lilies for Tarte palette I
wanted this palette so bad and this was
actually a part of my pan that palette
this year I did not like pan a whole
palette instead I just wanted to hit pan
on as many eyeshadows as possible and I
stuck this one in there so I do have pan
on those two shadows and I did that this
year so I'm gonna take a picture of this
so that I can have it for my finale
video but I don't want that to be a
reason for me to hold on to it just to
like show this at the end of the year
plus I know my mom has been eyeing this
palette so I thought it'd be nice to
pass it along to her this has great
shadows in it it has a blush bronzer
highlight I mean it's a great palette I
just I'm not inspired by this palette
anymore it's for me a little bit to
neutral and bland I just have other
stuff like this and I'd rather my mom
use it and love it and be excited about
it whereas like I'm just more into like
the dose of colors ice cream palette
like that's more my style so I'm gonna
pass this along to her as well the rest
of the stuff in here is just random
stuff in my collection that I was just
like going through today and getting
inspired obviously I have like a little
bit more of an intense look on today
because I was just playing around so
these are just some shadow sticks by the
brand Ellen Tracy I got these from set
they were like used as props on set and
so at the end of the short film they
gave them to me just because hello I'm
makeup and they had no other purpose for
them these just aren't very good look
this is like in the cap I don't know why
I decided to take these I guess just to
try them out but they don't set they're
not worth it and I don't use a ton of
cream shadow stick so I'm just gonna get
rid of them something that surprised me
and kind of started this whole like look
through my collection are these two
Tarte blushes these are from the
holidays kits that come out every year
this one's in the color prim and this
one's in the color daydream they're from
the same set and I use the color print
on my cheeks the other day and when I
used
it had a strange smell and I was like
that's really weird so I smelled the
powder and it's a powder it smells like
sulfur I have one more from this
collection that I haven't gotten rid of
and it doesn't smell like sulfur so I
don't know if it's the ingredients and
the specific blushes if these have gone
off I don't know all I know is that
specifically to me that smell is
absolutely disgusting I just have like
bad memories with that smell - so I just
can't do it and it's not worth it to me
so I'm gonna pass these along I don't
know I'm gonna see if my mom wants them
I don't know if they're off if you know
anything about that let me know down
below but yeah it's just like no I have
a few like based type a product so this
is a like tester size from I think it's
from Nordstrom and one of my friends
used to work at Nordstrom and so when
they were like getting rid of stuff she
picked this she picked a ton up for me
actually she took like a ton of them but
I passed him out at school cuz I didn't
I didn't need every single shade and
that was before I was like actually
working on entire different skin tones
so for me this is just not enough
coverage it's too liquidy and it also
just doesn't sit well with my oily skin
it's just not personally good for me so
I'm gonna see if my mom wants it other
than that I'm probably just gonna toss
it out if she doesn't so and so you guys
know this is the invisible fluid makeup
in one cn1 another foundation I'm
getting rid of this is the Rimmel clean
finish I used to love this foundation I
think that my skin is just gotten more
oily as I've gotten older because I
remember I could wear foundation like
all day for my whole eight hour chef
never have to touch up it was never a
big deal and so when I remembered that I
remembered using this foundation and I
just had this a while I think I've had
it since I've moved here so definitely
over a year and a half I've never
reached for it and I'm just at the point
where it's like I'm just kind of iffy on
reaching for it now so I'm just gonna
toss it one of the things that I'm
really wanting to buy are some new
foundations so that's something I'm like
researching into looking into looking at
reviews on so I thought I could part
with those two and the last kind of like
face product I think I believe so is
this concealer from freakin covergirl
and I hate this concealer they did not
have my beloved Maybelline fit me so I
just decided to pick up another
concealer I could find in a correct
shade this one's quite
this is in the shade fair and it's quite
pink as well this is basically to me
just like a medium light to medium
coverage foundation in a concealer
bottle it doesn't give me enough
coverage that you'd want a concealer to
do it's like I already put foundation on
it I'm using this to give me more
coverage I just think it's kind of
watery I just don't like the consistency
I feel like when I use this it like will
take away the foundation wherever I put
it so I just have to be kind of careful
about that it also dries kind of fast
and I find that that's when that happens
to most of our picks up the foundation
is if I I put it on here put it on here
and then like go down the middle of my
face when I go back to blend out here
it's just like I just don't like it I
really just dislike this so yeah I'm
just gonna pass it on to my mom see if
she finds use for it I'm not panning
this I'm really proud of myself for
saying that because part of me was like
I'll just finish it but then part of me
is it's like no I won't make it to look
good so I'm passing this along I'm
tossing out my Anasazi a dip brow this
is in the color blonde and I really
didn't use this much I'm not a dip brow
type of person I like pencils and
shadows personally I just don't think I
have the correct brush to be able to
really get the best outcome with this
mine straight up I definitely had it
over six months which is what the
expiration date on this is I tried
reviving this the other day to use it
just because I wanted to try something
different and I'm running out of brow
products and it just didn't work so I'm
just over it and I'm ready to throw it
out since it's basically useless anyway
I have a cream shadow here this is from
benefit and they discontinued these this
is also in the old packaging so I think
it's like two times just continued it's
just too dried up at this point to work
this was in my finish 20 by 2016 but I'm
not gonna finish this it's just to dry
and it's not worth it to me
I still have top brass and I have been
using that on days especially when I'm
like have no time or just don't really
want to fuss and that one's still nice
and creamy even though it's a little
dried out it still goes on like
perfectly this one just is just a little
too far gone and I'm not gonna revive it
since it's so old I have three different
eye shadow type products we'll start off
with this one this is from josie maran
and this is the rio de rose gold i think
that these coconut water color
eyeshadows are super nice I really
enjoyed the pygmy
but they have a packaging issue if the
guys have watched my packaging pet
peeves you know also if you guys have
bought these then you know it's not an
uncommon thing the doe foot applicator
on this comes off while it's sitting in
the water so mmm that's just frustrating
especially because these aren't cheap
they're like almost twenty dollars I
think I kept this because I just didn't
want to part with it yet but it's time
I'm gonna throw it away
and I just doubt I'll buy any more of
them I just they're beautiful but it's
just kind of sucky you know I have to
Orban de que shadows here now these are
from The Wizard of Oz palette B I had
the glenda the goodwitch palette and I
also had some singles and bought a
palette for them so that's why I had
separate little things to put these in
but the colors I'm getting rid of this
one is in the color tornado it's a dark
purple really pretty pigmentation
nothing wrong with the shadow it's just
not me I'm never gonna use this so I
just thought I would clear it out of my
collection and let someone else use it
since again I have the separate
packaging and this other one is called
South this is a beautiful color but I
don't go for greys or really cool tone
colors very often and if I do I have me
naked2 palette I have a lot of other
options so I'm gonna pass these along I
feel good about that one I feel like if
anything I can get to other Urban Decay
singles at some point in the future it's
not something I'm looking into but if I
do and I can put them in that palette
and use them that way
and the last I shadow I'm getting rid of
this is apricot ax buy the brand face
front this is a really pretty nude shade
I love these types of shades I used to
love them even more it's on the top here
but it doesn't really show up it's not
insanely pigmented and that's part of
the reason I'm getting rid of it it's
just kind of lackluster like it's okay
it's not bad but it's not great and I
have a lot of great ones that look like
this three more things that's it this is
a liner from Sephora now you're probably
freaking out cuz I love these glitter
liners and they don't sell them they
came in like a limited edition package I
believe this specific color is in
majestic purple this just isn't all
glitter it's actually a lot liner and
then some glitter in it instead of it
being like just glitter like how I like
to use these so I'm just gonna give
because I'm not gonna use it and I don't
want it sitting in my drawer this is
something that's just way too old this
is the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion and this is in the color sin you
guys all know this is old because the
packaging gives it away I think I've
changed the packaging on these twice now
so it's just too old I don't feel safe
putting it on my high so I'm going to
check it and I just decided to actually
be real with myself and get rid of that
and the last thing here this is a
mascara from Stila and this is the huge
extreme lash mascara this is supposed to
be comparable to the Too Faced better
than sex it has that hourglass shaped
wand it's supposed to give you volume
definitely gives you volume it's just
not my type of mascara I did use this
for a while and I think I might save it
for my mom I know we're supposed to not
share mascaras but I'll let her decide
if she wants this it has quite a bit in
it still it's just something I don't
like for myself personally I like
something a little bit longer I'd rather
have more length than volume if I had to
choose between the two
yeah just didn't work on me and I just
didn't like it and I have a lot of
mascaras to get through that's
everything I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I will talk to you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
