I don't normally vlog but we're going to
because this is the last what we're
gonna yeah we're gonna try that's a
really good turn board because start out
great in the morning and then it's
always like we did this awesome thing so
we are going to Disneyland today it's
the last day we're gonna be able to go
before our passes expire I'm so sad
about it but it's okay we're gonna go
and have a good time we're gonna ride
the guardians of the galaxy that's like
the new thing we've never done that so
that'll be fun and then all the other
stuff is getting ready for Halloween so
it's all being refurbished so that sucks
but it's gonna be good no it should be
good but before we even do that we're
gonna go get some donuts and we're gonna
get chick-fil-a because chick-fil-a is
like our thing we always go to shape
like we're so said we couldn't go to
breakfast that's all we know right now
we'll update you once we've done things
and talked about it when you didn't see
it just kidding no but probably donut
something egg so I'm excited what kind
of flavor are you gonna get there's a
nacho cheese nacho thing you're gonna
chat they are they don't even have that
you're gonna get the cold brew in
horchata maybe yeah we're going to tray
hose doughnuts and you Santa Monica
and something the money goes cinnamon I
cousin vine
we just found the car from tray hose and
we did taste some doughnuts in there but
it feels a little weird to vlog guys I
don't know if you've ever just try
taking a selfie in front of someone and
then try doing that but like a long time
that's of love it's a little awkward but
anyway so um this is over to you in a
lot of it this is the crumble what is
this cinnamon crumble
thanks okay what you haven't tasted any
of yours okay got the vegan coco loco's
it's made with coconut banana and a
little bit of loco I guess but crazy it
is pretty good it's actually really good
I would enjoy it again it's you would
choose it even though you're not vegan
yeah yeah that's good and it has it's
like heavier it's like about double the
weight of a regular donut yeah then more
dense yeah it's like a cake donut yeah
that's really good you wanna bite yeah
I'm gonna actually do it you know okay
the other donut I got was called the el
Diablo let me show it to you guys I did
not realize that this devil of a donut
has like chili peppers on it I don't
know if chili pepper whatever flakes
it's spicy when you eat it has some heat
to it and okay I'm so clean I don't
really like I'm gonna rat
I just don't I'm so plain I don't really
like I just don't like to be too
adventurous like I like food but I'm a
foodie in the sense of like I'll take
the cookies and cream ice cream thank
you
you know you're laughing because it done
rapping and talking oh that one looks
kind of good also the dulce de leche is
two doughnuts are better than one looks
like there's a little spittle on there
what is on that what is that that's the
I thought whose Dolce okay I don't know
no it's Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana I don't get it
you guys know he can't pronounce
anything this is good it's very sweet
you like caramel II yeah I don't want to
eat that thing oh it has like a salty I
tasted salt like immediately it's like I
wish that was just maple I know I'm just
very definitely highly suggest the
crumble though this one's really good so
yeah that's everything we're gonna head
down to Anaheim now I'm just being
myself that's the whole point of a vlog
okay anyway um you have different
aesthetics mine is aesthetic years as
he's so mean to me okay anyway we're
gonna head down to Anaheim now and
probably get actual lunch this was
mostly just to taste it
to go because it'd be fun and yeah we'll
see you guys in Disneyland
hi guys
as you can see we're walking we're
nowhere near Disneyland yet because we
don't park in the structure we save our
$18 and we walk so that's what we're
doing we're checking our way there now I
have my little umbrella for the Sun it's
like the hottest day we could have
chosen to go Disneyland I think this
will literally be the hottest day we've
ever been and that's also one of the
hottest days of the year
crazier it was doing some rays
so we're in line for guardians of the
galaxy
I think what she will show you around
guardians of the galaxy
okay guys we're at Disneyland still
centre-back I'm gonna show you our water
cup but we're just kind of hanging out
right now I'm very tired I think the
coffee has been kind of weird like I'm
like freaking out she said it's the wall
I did I said my brain feels like it's
turning into lava so I don't know what
that means we don't drink coffee very
often so yeah I'll show you guys our
view from here
I think we're just gonna do three rides
all right here no I'm freaking out no
I'm fine I just feel very strange I
don't know how to explain it we don't
drink coffee after like I said you want
to say this blog is a burden to me now
okay the idea of making vlogs always
sounds so fun so great but you really do
have to stop what you're doing to love
this crap oh yeah record
which I think would be so funny I like
watching blogs out look at this I just
wanna make crappy vlog it's just
definitely like you come to dishonor to
blog about this it's all smoke and
mirrors it's all fake there's a
Hollywood section of your time devoted
just to that yeah message failed to send
message failed to break convinced that
I'm skipping
now I love it we're going to keep all
this up I'm not gonna edit the blog it's
gonna be real we're doing it live
hey guys I just kinda wanted to end the
vlog so this is the end we are out to
eat right now I'm with Sam but we're
sitting opposite of each other oh sorry
hey yeah it was a long day at Disneyland
we had a good time it was so hot though
I think it reached like 115 degrees at
least in LA it was hot today it's crazy
so anyway I hope you enjoyed the vlog I
hope it was ok I know I was complaining
about it a little bit earlier it's not
that I don't like doing them I do it's
just it's just a lot more work than you
think when you watch someone else's
vlogs so anyway I hope having a great
day guys and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
