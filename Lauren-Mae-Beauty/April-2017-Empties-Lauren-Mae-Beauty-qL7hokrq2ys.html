my channel it's hilarious thanks so much
for watching this is going to be my
empties for April all May April empty so
I feel like I have quite a few things
here we'll start off with makeup items
for some of these I'm just getting rid
of but a few of them are actual empties
I have two mascaras that I am done like
these are used up the first one here is
the great lash Maybelline mascara in
very black this is a classic mascara and
this is what I use in my kit I know this
isn't anything fancy but in your kit
when you're applying makeup on other
people you are just using the mascara to
tint the lashes and either make them
like look darker or you're going to add
false lashes anyway also I feel like
mascaras are really good because their
wands and since I'm using this on
multiple people I'm just using
disposable wand so that has nothing to
do with the performance anymore from for
my uses so this works perfect it's cheap
and a lot of people use this in their
kit so I enjoy it I like it for myself I
used the pure fully charged mascara now
I really did enjoy this mascara this is
what the wand looks like I find that
these are starting to become some of my
favorite ones were their natural bristle
brushes but they aren't like a spoolie
shaped they're not just like a normal
spiral this worked really well until it
didn't
when I started to dry up I definitely
was getting a lot of flaking under my
eyes and that's ultimately what made me
stop using this I definitely would use
this again I'm not sure if I'd spend the
money on it but I definitely did enjoy
it I do have another mascara in here but
this is what I'm getting rid of this is
from the brands galley and guessing how
to say that I got this at generation
Beauty not this year but last year so
it's kind of old I hadn't opened it
until I started trying to use it but
this is one of those Long's that just I
mean you can't get your lashes into this
wand to even try to put anything on it
just doesn't even work like you cannot
it's not possible to get a good coating
on your lashes with this it's just
crappy do not like I don't know about
the formula because they can't even get
it on my eyes it's mostly that brush
that just is no no boy no another
product I'm just getting rid of this is
B by Carrie cellular Rose a brightening
Lumi theorem this is a really nice
product I've had it for a long time now
I never use it and so it's just time to
get rid of it I think that's just
getting old to still smell fine and it
looks like a little bit crazy in here
just because it's kind of cold so it'll
like separate and kind of congeal
because of the cold if it's warmer it
breaks down I don't know how to explain
it but it's a really nice product to put
on before you put on foundation it's
time it's time to get rid of it and last
thing here this is something that I did
used up but it also dried out this is
the brow tint from Ulta in the color
light this is very similar to benefits
give me brow has a very small bond I
really enjoyed this I would definitely
repurchase this and I do suggest it the
color looks nice I love that the wand is
so tiny you really can just you know use
it on your whole brow I mean they won
from Rimmel and they do like that one
but the wand is a bit bigger and I
prefer this smaller one I wish that one
has this wand and that's everything for
makeup siliceous dive into the rest of
the empties first thing on the top tier
this is the equate nail polish remover
and this is 100% acetone I know it's not
necessarily good for your nails or for
the skin around your nail but I prefer
under percent acetone because it just
gets the job done a hundred times faster
so for me I purchased acetone I think
I'm using an actual remover because I
got it from someone but I do prefer
acetone and this one worked fine we have
a petite this is the floral and flirty
blush scent
this one's nice but I'd really do prefer
the tropical scent um that was probably
my favorite one I have a few things from
Beauty blenders these are both the
beauty blender cleanser liquids and I
have one in this packaging and then I
have one in the kind of like pro size I
love this you guys know that I know a
lot of people talk about how you can use
all these other things and if those work
for you that's amazing but I do choose
use Beauty blenders in my kit and I want
something that I know is going to get
every last drop out of my Beauty Blender
and these work so amazing these get rid
of stains and I'm telling you if you've
ever used these you put this on your
Beauty Blender how I like to do it is
all what my Beauty Blender get it all
the way soaked as water and not wringing
it out so it's like nice and plump and
then I'll
a little bit of this on and I'll just
definitely massage it in and you just
see the foundation just like melt
abs-ebd Bunder it's crazy
and for my own personal use I would just
try to use up my baby shampoo I mean it
doesn't even compare it does not compare
I can't even put it into words so I
guess you're purchased another one of
these and I will continue to repurchase
and I'm going to use the Beauty Blender
in my kit I feel like these are
essentials and I love that they keep get
out the phase too so that they look nice
and professional
I'm in love I love these they are
expensive but they are worth the price
to me we'll talk about some bath and
Bodyworks stuff first I have the Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works wild berry and chamomile this
is so good this is like my favorite
scent that I smelt from them in a long
time I miss it
I will definitely repurchase this this
just doesn't smell at all like what it
says it's going to smell like to me it's
almost tropical has this like creamy
undertones I love it
I highly suggest you smell this I talked
about this in my last top 5 favorites
video for I think the month of March
it's so good I love love love this I
have to hand soaps this month I think we
live through more hansip because my mom
did come and visit me recently so there
were more people in the house than
normal the first one here is certainly
pear Riesling this one I did not like I
don't really like the small appearances
I'm deciding it's not that a small bag I
just don't like the solitaire and
discover my nerves I didn't like it
luckily it was one of those funds that
the mauryans the more I got used to it
instead the more I hated it but I
probably will purchase anything with
pear in the title again except for the
frosted Fagan pear that I love that Fred
that's like oldest oldest time I would
repurchase that one and the other one
was California citrus sunshine this was
nice I used to do in my bathroom this is
probably more of a kitchen scent
this noisy which is like citrusy and
bright I would purchase probably another
citrus scent but not necessarily this
one I don't know it's okay I used up a
candle from Bath and Body Works this is
the spring leaves candle this is a newer
candle and I'm happy to get through it
because I did just buy it so I know I
got my money's worth out of it and
enjoyed it but I am trying to work on
burning older candles because you know
those are the songs that I'm having a
hard time getting rid of because I've
had them for
forever the notes on this are a gala
Apple warm cinnamon stick and crisp
Bartlett pear there's that tears and now
I enjoyed this mice melted in a store I
do feel like the more I burned this the
more I didn't like it and that cinnamon
stick really made it like a very festive
scent like fan and I commented multiple
times about how it's not like Christmas
or like the holidays and not like spring
so I don't think that spring leaves is
an appropriate name for this
I wouldn't purchase it again but I it
was okay it was okay you guys know I'm
trying to use up my law flowers and I
just want to let you know I just
finished one and then the new one in my
kitchen is the ocean drift what I do
really like this it smells nice and
manly we'll see what I pick next month I
have some of my wife's from here these
are the FEL facial cleansing tissues
this is in the white pack there is no
like aloe or anything saying what kind
these are I don't like these they're not
as moist as the other ones I don't
suggest these but I do like the FPL aloe
ones into my favorite I use the petone
er this is the Amira hydrating toner and
this is in the resurgence I believe that
this green line is for a Karen Burwell
in my training got trying to remember my
old knowledge I think it's like
environmental stress so like pollutants
and things like that I think this is
really nice it smells nice I would
definitely consider putting this in my
kit I don't know if I'd pick a price of
it as it was pretty pricey I might get a
discount though it's about what sway me
I just love fix+ but I do think this is
different and serves a different purpose
and fix+ I also really like the German
washable toner so I probably go between
this one or that one
when I need something or if someone was
like asking what my recommendations were
that one was nice another thing from
Mira but this one I'm getting rid of
because it's bad this is the detoxifying
white clay to body cleanser I use this
twice I brought the Arizona with me and
used it and I kind of felt like it was
weird but the entire situation was
working like in a different shower than
I normally am and just you know if you
have your routine and you go somewhere
else it can just be all weird and I
thought maybe that was part of it but I
use it at home and it just smells a
little off to me is the consistency I
feel like is maybe a little off I don't
know everything about it was just like
all signs point to
in the trash what we're doing it's going
to go to the trash yeah I can't really
give a review other than that oh yeah
this looks really scary but I just put
this honest wooden pink everywhere
because this is these shampoos I use to
dye my hair pink this is the viral
extreme hot pink color wash and it's
from the brand I think celeb luxury now
these are a pro products only so if you
can somehow get someone to get this for
you like a hairdresser or whatever I get
mine I Cosmoprof they cost about $17 if
I can find any links to this I will link
them down below so you can try them out
I highly recommend this this is my
yearly favorites last year it's what I
use again every single time to dye my
hair I love that you can put these on in
the shower specifically this hot pink
one does stain your hands so works off
of it it's nothing where it'll be
staying for like days and days but it
might stain like in your cuticles and
your nails and different things so to me
that's a trade-off for not having to
like sit and dye my hair like this is
just so much easier that it's worth it I
tend to let my color fade out and then
use this every third time to kind of
bring it back it's really nice though I
love this highly suggest it if you can
get your hands on it that's the only
thing I do think that they're trying to
make this available to the public
but there are a lot of other guys out
there I just don't know if there's a lot
of other shampoo dyes so let me know if
you know any down below that I could be
the try out or at least you guys can
recommend to each other if you can't get
your hands on this I only have a few
more products I have another shampoo in
here this is the American Crew daily
moisturizing shampoo I didn't have a
conditioner to this just the shampoo my
mom probably got it and gets the Sam for
Christmas or something because she
always gives him and my brother like
manly like beauty products this not nice
it was kind of like an herbal flash and
minty type of scent it just tingled
ahead a little bit I find a lot of
amends shampoos do that it was nice
I wouldn't repurchase but if I got it
I'd use it I didn't hate it I'm pretty
low-maintenance when it comes to
shampoos as long as they're not overly
greasy on the hair and they don't tangle
my hair too much I'm pretty okay
randomly I have a sense of dye in here
this is the deep clean I enjoyed using
this up
had anything left I was just trying to
like get the clutter out and last I
useable lotion guys I'm so proud of
myself this is the righteous butter from
soap and glory
that's all applause nothing I was using
this as a hand cream on my bedside table
every night I also let Sam use some of
it sometimes I give the smell of this is
a night I know people like freak out
like it smells good but it also smells
like a fancy grandma like it's a little
granny I don't know I enjoyed this I
would repurchase it at some point I
guess in the future but if I was going
to get a body cream I would get the
Jakara candle nut cream I think that
one's just amazing so those are all my
empties guys I hope you enjoyed thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
