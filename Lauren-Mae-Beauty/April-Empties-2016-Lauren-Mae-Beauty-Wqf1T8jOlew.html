Lauren this is going to be my April
empties video and I used up quite a few
things for the month of April plus i
have a few just like kind of get rid of
items so let's get into it i'll start
with the makeup items first because
they're the most fun i technically only
used up like three full items which is
still really awesome because i don't
reshout things from Project pans so
these are like completely outside of
project pans things I've used up but
there is a couple things I'm just like
getting rid of so first thing here
something I'm really excited about this
is the Nivea lip butter in the smooth
kiss boom baby then this was in my
project pan like eyes trying to finish
30 by the end of the year for 2015 like
25th 4 2016 started obviously and I
don't know what I was thinking I thought
I could finish it but I have like over
half the product left when i did that
and now it is all gone I use this by my
bedside table before I go to bed I just
put some on my lips so glad it's gone I
really do like this product but this
just takes me forever to go through so
this is something I would never want
backups of like ever ever I think to
it's kind of fun to switch up lip balm
because I don't wear a lot of lip
products but the products I do wear a
lip balm so that's like a fun thing for
me to explore a new option so I don't
know when I'll repurchase this or how
long it'll be but it is nice and I do
suggest it if you're looking for
something and it is relatively cheap I
have already gone through one of these
brow pencils from Maybelline this is the
define a brow in the color dark blonde I
got two of these from Ulta these come
out I think they're 599 a piece but then
I had like a coupon and they just came
out to really cheap I really like these
because I have like a small tip on them
so they're just easy to get a nice
defined brow but you just use them up so
fast and that's something that's kind of
irritating also sometimes if you you
twirl this up too much and I'm not
talking like way too much I mean just a
little bit it'll break off which is a
little frustrating because it already
goes so fast and then for that to happen
I probably will repurchase these again I
just I'm telling you my frustrations
about it but I do like it I like the
color and I think it works well and it
is again pretty cheap but yeah those are
just some of my issues with it in the
last item here is a primer this is the
Smashbox photo finish foundation for
and this is the core minimizing one I
love this is one of my favorite
pore-minimizing products ever I cut this
open and use my beauty spatula to get
every last bit i could out of it I again
really like this Oh Sam something Sam's
home so I really like this product and
something that Heather from love
Heatherette had told me or told everyone
in the video like she's just talking to
me but anyway this is a half ounce I
think and the full size I don't know
it's cheaper to buy the small versions
of this product than to buy the full
size like Fred the amount of money are
paying per ounce so definitely get the
small one if you are gonna try this it's
like cheaper and you don't have as much
product on hand at once if you find
something else you like don't let them
fool you into getting the big one but
that is something that is entirely
insane to me like that they would do
that but anyway I finished that and I
love it now we're just gonna go kind of
Rando through this bag so I have two
hair dyes here these are the color
brilliance brights I on magenta
semi-permanent hair color this is the
color I have in my hair now obviously
it's super faded in my previous video
this was the color so i really like
these they do rinse out pretty fast i
feel like so that's every color i've
ever used though so i can't say that
that's an issue with just this brand but
i do like these i really like the color
specifically it's kind of a mix between
like a hot pink and it still has some
purple in it though I like this this is
something I'm getting rid of these are
from Marshalls I actually hauled this in
a marshalls hall i'll link that down
below I've never used them yet they just
remind me of sheet masks and you guys
know I hate sheet masks and I don't know
I'm just freaked out to use these I just
because it came from marshalls and I
feel like everything I Marshalls like
expired already sometimes and I don't
know oh it says the manufacturing date
on here is 1220 2014 that kind of freaks
me out I mean it had never opened it yet
so they could be fine but just I just
know myself and I know I'm not gonna use
them so I'm just throwing them away
instead of hoarding them for a longer
and longer last month I finished up the
shampoo to this and this is the
conditioner oh wait no I'd opposite way
last one they use up the conditioner and
this is the shampoo this was from
influence
it's the kerastase resistance bayonet
therapist and this is like a backwards
type of system so you use the
conditioner first and then shampoo your
hair so I was really happy that I had
more shampoo left at the ends and
conditioner because I'm always the
opposite way and I don't use a lot of
conditioner so that was nice I love the
smell of this just like in that last
video I would not repurchase just
because it's so expensive but it smells
really nice and I did enjoy it if I got
it for free I would definitely use it
but it's just expensive these are some
face wipes these are the signature care
what cleansing towelettes they were 30
in here these are like Vaughn's brands
which is like Safeway brand they were ok
they were bigger than my normal ones and
they kind of had a pattern like a
quilted pattern on them so they did have
like a nice texture to kind of take off
makeup with I would not repurchase on
though because these were I think the
cheapest ones at my grocery store and
they were still like five dollars and I
could get five packs of my other wipes
and I'm cheap so I'd rather have cheap
wipes if they were quite a hot cheap
ones i have a dry shampoo this is the
batiste dry shampoo and this is the
fruity and cheeky cherry i get mine at
marshalls i love them i basically love
every single flavor or scent of these i
don't really like the leopard one it's a
little too spicy or like kalloni to me
but I love this dry shampoo that's my
absolute favorite it's so good this is a
micellar water from Garnier this is very
similar to bioderma i have used many
bioderma in the past it's been a while
but i had like four of them at one point
cuz they brought them back from France
and to me I like this just as much again
it's been a little bit so maybe if I try
that again I'd be different but I think
this is just so good for the price it's
like 899 i think but the simple one is
smaller than this and like six something
so i just like to get the bigger one for
two dollars more i just feel like this
lasted me a lot longer than the simple
one does i like the simple one for my
kit cuz it's small but this one is great
for out i used up a like lighter this is
like a long one so you can actually like
get in your candles without burning your
fingers i got these at the dollar store
for our wedding and i'm just using them
up this is a face cream from sebamed and
this is the moisturizing face cream for
sensitive skin this has no parabens I
got sent this from sebamed to try out
just some of their prod
x i did really enjoy this me and Sam
both uses but like Courtney k said this
smells like bell peppers it does it's
kind of a weird scent but something from
origins also has a scent like this it's
one of their face scrubs also smells
kind of like bell peppers I thought
because this was in a jar that it would
be thicker but it's more like a daytime
moisturizer but it doesn't have SPF in
it so I'm kind of thought that was weird
I feel like usually things in jars like
this are for a nighttime and because it
didn't have SPF that's what I was
thinking but as I used it its it's thick
but a thin texture attends out and so it
just works better to me for the daytime
and I just like something a little
heavier at night I'm not saying I would
never repurchase this but it's not
readily available to me like in my
grocery stores are at walgreens and
stuff so I'll probably just go with
other things before this i have another
thing of wipes these aren't necessarily
face wipes they're just antibacterial
hand wipes i use this for swatches and
just different things they were in my
kit but there were only a couple left
and just pointless to have like four
wipes and your kit so I took him out and
just use them up and they're gone I
would purchase them again they were only
a dollar from the dollar store I have a
hands up here this one is from Bath and
Body Works this is the white pair and
fig what a my all-time favorite scents
ever have one more of these left I
stopped up on it because I just love
this and I'm trying to go for the scent
oh I could still smell it even though
I'm kind of sick it smells so good I
really really like this edge I wish this
was like an all-year-round sons I would
purchase it a million times over because
it smells that good I just love this I
used it but deodorant this one is from
dove it's the go fresh cool essentials I
got this in a costco pack and I'm on my
last one right now I have another
toothpaste this one is from colgate it's
the advanced whitening again this was
from costco too and it was our last
costco pack one we're probably gonna end
up going back to a costco pack because i
just feel like toothpaste is so
expensive if you're not like couponing
here in California I don't know why but
toothpaste is like at the cheapest 350
apiece and that's like for the small one
and then other than that it just like
goes up and up so i think i might just
get a costco pack again anyway i have a
couple smaller dry shampoos here this
one is from joico it's the instant
refresh i had this in my march mini
madness and i didn't quite use it all
the way up but it is now gone i don't
like this direction paola doesn't do
thing to work as a direction poo I just
hate this direction boom it's so bad I
do not suggest it this is another one
this one's rock your hair spray clean
dry shampoo I really liked this and I
ended up buying it in the full size from
Marshall so i didn't pay full price for
it but I think this one's really good
it's a nice mix between the Bautista one
but a little bit more volumizing and
like a little more gritty texture I do
like this and it's a little more
expensive than Battiste so I don't know
how many whoo how many times I'm going
to repurchase it but I do like it this
is a hairspray this is the Babel asst
pro miracurl hairspray this says it's a
long-lasting control and finish strong
cold I don't think this is stronghold
Sam used this up I didn't I don't use
hairspray I don't think it was like
super strong you didn't make his hair
super crunchy or anything I just kind of
kept it throughout the day I don't know
I wouldn't repurchase this one like go
out to find this one I would just find
like a medium hold hairspray that will
work for him I have a brush cleaner here
this is the dr bronner's magic soap and
it's the lavender scent I got this from
marshalls and it was 999 for this
container I have used this since we
moved here so it's been about a this is
also in that marginals Hall I think so
it's been about a year since i've had
this and I finally just cleaned it up
and that's me going through makeup
school and all that so I definitely
think this is worth the money I think it
clean my brushes really well I liked the
lavender scent I'd probably try
something else just because I like to
try different things but i do like
lavender scent so this was nice i
actually have the bar soap one now i
don't know what the scent is but I kind
of like bar soap it's just easy to use
so i used up another one of the
wallflowers i think this was like a cup
cake vanilla cupcake scent or something
we did not like it yeah I took a lot to
choose this up so it's gone and I need
to work on putting a new one in but our
apartment is quite small and I'm I've
been sensitive lately because of my
sickness is plus I've been making my
candles and stuff so it's just like I
don't want to have a scent just like
roaming around so I probably won't put a
Wallflower in for a while only a few
things left to go this is
thing I'm just getting rid of and
throwing away this is expired but it's
from kula and it is the mineral
sunscreen moisturizer it's SPF 20 I'm
sure just the SPF 20 is expired because
it was only well it's been expired since
februari so I just it's just not worth
it I don't need to use up a fake like an
expired sunscreen spray sunscreen sample
sounds grim creeper I used up to foil
packets this one is the pore minimizer
from Dior I do not like this I don't
think it works nearly as well as the
Smashbox and I'm sure it's a lot more
expensive so I will not be purchasing
that this is the glam glow super mud
clearing treatment I use this as a spot
treatment and I have a couple more
sample packets left of this I really
like this product once I run out of
sample packets I don't know if I'm gonna
repurchase the whole full mask I'll
probably just purchase a different spot
treatment but i did use this last night
because i do have a couple spots are in
my face and I do think it helps so I
like it I used up a floss we always use
the reach mint wax mostly I just use
whatever the dollar flosses and whenever
floss is a dollar I just like by six of
them and just stockpile them and the
last thing I is up this is the roadie
I'll Dragon's Blood sculpting gel me and
Sam use this up we only have one more of
these left from the ton i bought when
they were at costco i really do like
this although I do find that it's not
super hydrating so I think this would
work really well if you were using a
really hydrating prom serum not primer a
hydrating serum underneath this and then
putting this on at night but if you have
really dry skin I don't think this is
going to be enough moisture for you
because it's barely enough moisture for
me and I am oily and Sam is super dry
and he puts it on it his skin drinks up
in like two seconds so I think it works
nice it feels good it smells good I like
the product I just think that if you
need a lot of moisture definitely pair
this with something if you still want to
get the benefits of this one or just go
for something that's more hydrating
those are all my empties for the month
of April definitely a lot of things that
I used up which feels great I definitely
want to just move things out I have a
couple of different videos coming after
this one that I want to film I have some
like updates for like yearly type of
projects that I have going on a couple
different things I think I'm gonna do
like an inventory for my bath and body
type of stuff so just different things
like that I've been branching out with
it kind of just
counting up in my house and i'm just
really pumped to get more stuff out so
i'm really happy too of course like
every time like it's the same stuff I'm
really happy to use all this crap out I
still am still happy about it so I hope
you guys are doing great i'll see you in
my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
