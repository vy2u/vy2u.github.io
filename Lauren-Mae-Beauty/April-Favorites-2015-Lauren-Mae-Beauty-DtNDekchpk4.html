Lauren I am going to do my April
favorite today I have like a bit of
stuff even though this is a bull so it's
kind of deceiving no big this bin is I
have some awesome makeup items I've been
really loving this month as well as a
few like random favourites so let's get
into it and I can show you guys the
stuff that I've been loving I hope this
is in focus anyway this product here is
from Ulta this is the brow tint in the
color light it's very similar to the
benefit one and it has a very small
little brush on it it's so tiny um I
have been really enjoying this which I
didn't really like it when I first got
it just because I just hadn't really
given it a chance or I don't know I just
thought it wasn't going to be good but
I've been using this because I ran out
of my honesty of broadway's in dark
brown and I have since gotten a
different pencil clinic one because I
had some Macy's cash to use but um the
color of it is just quite cool toned and
may feel like my brows just look really
ashy what you know usually you'd go for
like a more brown tone or um cool toned
color but something about it just looks
really weird so this kind of warmed it
up and I've really been liking this
running it through on my brows after I
fill them in and it just kind of changes
them from like dull and just kind of I
don't know I just look sad i guess like
the color themselves look sad this kind
of warms it up makes it look alive and
I've really been liking this I have not
tried the benefit one so I can't tell
you how it compares to that one but this
one for the price i think is definitely
worth a try and I've been liking that
this is an e pearl liner and this is
like has a really fine tip on it
hopefully you guys can see it there this
is a great liner um I have been really
into doing wings that's really what this
like favorite is doing winged liner for
a really long time I stopped doing
winged liner and only like tight lined
it just was really kind of more natural
with my liner but I have really been
liking the look of a winged liner I
think it just brings more definition to
my face especially when I work losses
which I
glasses all the time like whenever I go
out and they I don't know if that
definition just kind of makes my eyes
come alive and like shine even behind my
glasses and I really like that plus I
just think it complements my eye shape
really well so this specifically though
is Eve pearl liner and I've had this for
so long it's just been going strong I
think it's almost on its way out but um
this is a really great one if you guys
ever have the chance to try it
especially on a discounted price I
definitely would pick it up and try it
it lasts so long the tip on it is just
like a felt tip it's not like a brush
tip but it stayed super pointy this
entire time it's not like it's balled up
at the end or anything so that is
something I have been loving winged
liner with a like liquid pen liner type
of product I have also been loving my
hourglass palette now this wasn't my
favorites last month but the color that
I'm specifically talking about is this
bronze color here called radiant light
and for me I use this as kind of like a
bronzer and overall just like face
warmer upper um I haven't been liking
the way my Too Faced bronzer has been
blending in I just feel like it looks
patchy especially throughout the day
once my face it's kind of oily I feel
like it looks even more patchy than it
did in the morning so I've been using
this kind of as like a baseball wore my
whole face up in the places that I would
contour with this shade here and then
I'll go in and just kind of deep in up
where one up a more intense contour with
the other the two-faced shade so I've
really been liking that I feel like this
gives a nice base for it to like blend
out better and it just it looks more
seamless and I just really have been
liking the effect a lot more than I was
so it's been great this does have a
little bit of shimmer in it because it's
one of the ambient lighting powder so it
just has like a sheen to it and I think
that Sheen just helps it blend out
better and it just adds a radiance to my
face I don't feel like a shimmer ball or
anything I just feel very like
spring/summer bronze just nice and it
just looks really nicely blended so that
is something I've been loving I'm really
happy too it's a more in focus back here
I'm really happy to that I've been
busting this palette out just because I
was using it when I first got it a lot
and then I haven't really been using it
and now I've been using it a lot more
and I'm just glad to be getting some
money's worth out of this item so that I
have been liking quite a bit I think the
rest of the makeup items are actually
all lip products so this first one here
this is a lip liner from Jordana this is
the color tawny and I bought this
because it's one of the cheapest liners
at the drugstore that's a swatch of the
color there it's so so pretty and I've
been using this as a lip liner for other
colors and then I've even just been
wearing this itself since it's a lip
liner it is Matt and I just really like
the color of this I know some people
aren't into lip liners I personally for
the most part I'm especially if i'm
doing like a brighter lip just because
i'm not very good at doing a lip line
without it and if you're going to do a
bright lip you really need that crisp
like lying on the lips if you have any
wonky lines they're totally going to be
noticeable and if its a bright color
like extremely noticeable so for me lip
liners just help me get that nice shape
before I go in with my actual product
and it just makes the whole process
easier for me this color though I think
is just great I really want to try the
rock and Rose I think is one I want to
try that lip liner I probably I mean
it'd be nice just to have all the lip
liners from the range in my collection
so I can mix and match with whatever
colors i'm going to be putting on my
lips but this is the only one I have and
I've been loving it so much i have been
using this i'm also in conjunction with
my next favorite which is steel as
patina stay all day liquid lipstick I've
been loving that I don't know where it
went I've lost it I think it's in my
purse or somewhere I don't know where it
went but this goes so well with that
color I will leave a link to my friends
hall which has it in there if you're
interested in seeing it but again it's
the Stila stay all day liquid lipstick
in the color patina and it's very
similar to this it's a very like kylie
jenner darker mavi nude type of color
and it just goes really well with this
color and this is actually a little bit
lighter than that color so I just do
this to make that like basically full
floor plan to then go on top of that
liquid lipstick with and it just helps
me not like totally mess it up and
it's like stained and horrible on the
outside of my lips so those two I've
been loving and then more recently I got
this to face melted lipstick in the
color fuchsia and I absolutely love this
I was going to wear statement of the
floor and you wanted so much like you
can't wear it in every video so i will
give you guys a swatch of this that's it
there I really just love this color the
scent of this product smells so good
it's so sweet but in like the best way
ever and these are not super like Matt
but they can dry down to a matte finish
what I really like doing with these is
just using the most minimal product it
possibly can because I do find that it
will like ring around the inside of your
lips which is no fun and also can lead
to you getting product on your teeth but
you can always just wipe it away you can
feel it too so you know it's there but
when i use just a little bit of this
product just enough to get that color on
my lips one it is more matte which is
something i like it'll last longer all
that type of stuff but it also just
doesn't create that problem and the
color on this is just so beautiful I
can't wait to get more I really really
want some more of these I really want to
try one of the melted metal ones on that
just came out but I haven't yet so I've
really been liking this and I think it's
really great if you haven't tried any of
these i would definitely at least go
swatch them and see if there's a color
you'd really like you know the whole
liquid lipstick thing is totally on
trend right now and i think this is a
really good one so I like that a lot
this is another product it's not like a
mega product it's a hair product this is
Moroccan oil and why is everything I
feel like I'm am I out of focus I'm so
sorry if I'm out of focus this whole
time but anyway this is the Moroccan oil
I was using the it to 10 detangler for a
really long time and I wasn't going to
bust this open until I finish that up so
that is all gone and now i'm on to this
and this is just my favorite i realized
i've gone through this is my third
bottle of this i get this for Christmas
every year from my mom so it's like a
one-year it usually goes I go through it
in about a year and it's just great the
smell of it smells really nice and the
just the oil itself is such a nice like
lucious oil it doesn't feel greasy it
just feels moisturizing
and for me my hair gets greasy really
fast I have very thin fine hair so using
an oil as sometimes the scariest thing
it's a scary scary idea but this one
I've used for so long it works so nicely
I usually use about like one maybe two
pumps with the links on my hair now
which is about here and I just put it
from like my ears down on both sides and
I've been really liking this i'm so glad
that i'm using this again and i think
it's wonderful i think that's it for
like actual products some other
favorites that i've had this month and
just in general i have been loving lomo
saltado that is a Peruvian dish and I've
never had peruvian food until we moved
here and one of Sam's co-workers like
recommended this place called Mario's
down in hollywood on Vine Street um I
think I swear it is anyway it was so
delicious it's basically like steak and
like really big cut up onions and
tomatoes and then like french fries and
like a mound of rice and it's so good
it's so salty and like hearty and like
oh so good i like crave it all the time
i absolutely love it so yeah if you ever
want to like try some early get food if
that's like probably one of like the
most popular dishes or at least I feel
like it every time I go in there's two
different peruvian restaurant there's
one really close to us like up the
street that we go to a lot and that's
what a lot of people get there so um
yeah lomo saltado that is one of my
favorites definitely this month but just
since we've moved here and i've tried it
it's been delicious and um i think the
only thing I have left are just like TV
show so I have been loving Hannibal I
finished season 1 and season two
basically in April and um it's
definitely a darker show and it's very
gory and it's definitely course thriller
style so if you don't like that you
probably won't like the show but
something about it the whole aesthetic
the way it's shot the way that it looks
is so beautiful like it just looks so
good the show looks so good um I think
the actors do an amazing job in that
show and I just really enjoyed it i will
say that i fell harder for it like
during the second season than i did for
the first season I kind of was just like
forcing myself to watch the first season
but I really enjoyed second season then
I really can't wait to see the third one
I was watching it on Amazon Instant
prime amazon prime instant I don't know
the order of that but if you have that
it was free the first two seasons were
free and you can watch them instantly so
yeah if you're interested you could
watch it on there and then the other
show i've been loving is America's Next
Top Model this is so i can watch in
Sam's not here cuz he definitely doesn't
want to watch that show that's for sure
I've been watching I watched season 11
and recycle 11 and cycle 12 is what i'm
watching now i just started like
somewhere in the middle like randomly
but that's also on amazon instant crime
and i think you can like watch the first
like 19 cycles like for free on there so
that has what that is what I have been
streaming lately I've just been totally
obsessed with watching it I love I wish
though you know if someone could just
make a compilation of just like their
photos and the critiques and who went
home and then the photos and the
critiques inhuman home that's really all
i care about but that's like my favorite
part i guess of the show is just seeing
those beautiful photos and just kind of
like hearing the critiques just because
I don't have anything about fashion or
modeling or anything like that so it's
just cool to hear what they think about
it I really enjoy it anyway that has
everything for this video guys let me
know what your favorites were in the
comments down below or are I hope
there's still your favorites and I will
see you great so my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
