Lauren I am going to do my April
favorites today I have like a bit of
stuff even though this is a bull so it's
kind of deceiving no big this business I
have some awesome makeup items I've been
really loving this month as well as a
few like random favorites so let's get
into it and I can show you guys the
stuff that I've been loving I hope this
is in focus anyway
this product here is her molta this is
the brow tint in the color light it's
very similar to the benefit one and it
has a very small little brush on it it's
so tiny I have been really enjoying this
which I didn't really like it when I
first got it just because I just hadn't
really given it a chance or I don't know
I just thought it wasn't gonna be good
but I've been using this because I ran
out of my Anasazi brow was in dark brown
and I have since gotten a different
pencil Clinique one because I had some
Macy's cash to use but the color of it
is just quite cool toned and I feel like
my brows just look really ashy what you
know usually you'd go for like a more
brown tone or cool toned color but
something about it just looks really
weird so this kind of warms it up and
I've really been liking this running it
through on my brows after I fill them in
and it just kind of changes them from
like dull and just kind of I don't know
I just look sad I guess like the color
themselves look sad this kind of warms
it up makes it look alive and I've
really been liking this I have not tried
the benefit one so I can't tell you how
it compares to that one but this one for
the price I think is definitely worth a
try and I've been liking that this is an
e pearl liner and this is like has a
really fine tip on it hopefully you guys
can see it there this is a great liner I
have been really into doing wings that's
really what this like favourite is doing
winged liner for a really long time I
stopped doing winged liner and only like
tight lined and just was really kind of
more natural with my liner but I have
really been liking the look of a winged
liner I think it just brings more
definition to my face especially when I
wear glasses which I wear glasses all
the time I go
I go out and they I don't know just that
definition just kind of makes my eyes
come alive and like shine even behind my
glasses and I really like that plus I
just think it complements my eye shape
really well so this specifically though
is Eve pearl liner and I've had this for
so long it's just been going strong I
think it's almost on its way out but
this is a really great one if you guys
ever have the chance to try it
especially on a discounted price I
definitely would pick it up and try it
it lasts so long the tip on it is just
like a felt tip it's not like a brush
tip but it stayed super pointy this
entire time it's not like it's balled up
at the end or anything so that is
something I have been loving winged
liner with a like liquid pen liner type
of product I have also been loving my
hourglass palette now this was in my
favorites last month but the color that
I'm specifically talking about is this
bronze color here called radiant light
and for me I use this as kind of like a
bronzer and and overall just like face
warmer upper um I haven't been liking
the way my Too Faced bronzer has been
blending in I just feel like it looks
patchy especially throughout the day
once my face it's kind of oily I feel
like it looks even more patchy than it
did in the morning so I've been using
this kind of as like a base all worn my
whole face up in the places that I would
contour with this shade here and then
I'll go in and just kind of deepen up
where one more intense contour with the
other with the Too Faced shade so I've
really been liking that I feel like this
gives a nice base for it to like blend
out better and it just it looks more
seamless and I just really have been
liking the effect a lot more than I was
so it's been great this does have a
little bit of shimmer in it cuz it's one
of the ambient lighting powder so it
just has like a sheen to it and I think
that Sheen just helps it blend out
better and it just adds a radiance to my
face I don't feel like a shimmer ball or
anything I just feel very like
spring/summer bronze just nice and it
just looks really nicely blended so that
is something I've been loving I'm really
happy to it's a more in focus back here
I'm really happy to that I've been
busting this palette out just because I
was using it when I first got it a lot
and then I haven't really been using it
and now I've been using it a lot more
and I'm just glad to be getting some
money's worth out of this item so that I
have been liking quite a bit I think the
rest of the makeup items are actually
all lip products so this first one here
this is a lip liner from Jordana this is
the color tawny and I bought this
because it's one of the cheapest liners
at the drugstore
that's a swatch of the color there it's
so so pretty and I've been using this as
a lip liner for other colors and then
I've even just been wearing this itself
since it's a lip liner it is matte and I
just really like the color of this I
know some people aren't into lip liners
I personally for the most part am
especially if I'm doing like a brighter
lip just because I'm not very good at
doing the lip line without it and if
you're gonna do a bright lip you really
need that crisp like line on the lips if
you have any wonky lines they're totally
gonna be noticeable and if it's a bright
color like extremely noticeable so for
me lip liners just helped me get that
nice shape before I go in with my actual
product and it just makes the whole
process easier for me this color though
I think is just great I really want to
try the rock and rose I think is one I
want to try that lip liner I probably I
mean it'd be nice just to have all the
lip liners from the range in my
collection so I can mix and match with
whatever colors I'm gonna be putting on
my lips but this is the only one I have
and I've been loving it so much I have
been using this also in conjunction with
my next favorite which is steel as
patina stay all day liquid lipstick I've
been loving that I don't know where it
went
I've lost it I think it's in my purse or
somewhere I don't know where it went but
this goes so well with that color I will
leave a link to my friends hall which
has it in there if you're interested in
seeing it but again it's the Stila stay
all day liquid lipstick in the colour
patina and it's very similar to this
it's a very like Kylie Jenner darker
Mavi nude type of color and it just goes
really well with this color and this is
actually a little bit lighter than that
color so I just do this to make that
like basically full floor plan to then
go on top of that liquid lipstick with
and it just helps me not like I'm
totally mess it up and then it's like
and horrible on outside of my lips so
those two I've been loving and then more
recently I got this to face melted
lipstick in the color fuchsia and I
absolutely love this I was gonna wear
statement of McLaurin you've worn it so
much like you can't wear it in every
video so I will give you guys a swatch
of this that's it there I really just
love this color the scent of this
product smells so good it's so sweet but
in like the best way ever and these are
not super like matte but they can drag
down to a matte finish or I really like
doing with these is just using the most
minimal product it possibly can because
I do find that it will like ring around
the inside of your lips which is no fun
and also can lead to you getting product
on your teeth but you can always just
wipe it away you can feel it too so you
know it's there but when I use just a
little bit of this product just enough
to get that color on my lips one it is
more matte which is something I like
it'll last longer all that type of stuff
but it also just doesn't create that
problem and the color on this is just so
beautiful I can't wait to get more I
really really want some more of these I
really want to try one of the melted
metal ones um that just came out but I
haven't yet so I've really been liking
this and I think it's really great if
you haven't tried any of these I would
definitely at least go swatch them and
see if there's a color you'd really like
you know the whole liquid lipstick thing
is totally on trend right now and I
think this is a really good one so I
like that a lot
this is another product it's not like a
makeup product it's a hair product this
is Moroccan oil and why is everything I
feel like I'm am I out of focus I'm so
sorry if I'm out of focus this whole
time but anyway this is the Moroccan oil
I was using the it's a 10 detangler for
a really long time and I wasn't gonna
bust this open until I finished that up
so that is all gone and now I'm onto
this and this is just my favorite I
realized I've gone through this is my
third bottle of this I get this for
Christmas every year for my mom so it's
like a 1 year it usually goes I go
through it in about a year and it's just
great the smell of it it smells really
nice and just the oil itself is such a
nice like luscious oil it doesn't feel
greasy it just feels moisturizing and
for me my hair gets greasy really foul
I have very thin fine hair so using an
oil s sometimes the scariest thing it's
a scary scary idea but this one I've
used for so long it works so nicely I
usually use about like one maybe two
pumps with the links on my hair now
which is about here and I just put it
from like my ears down on both sides and
I've been really liking this I'm so glad
that I'm using this again and I think
it's wonderful I think that's it for
like actual products some other
favorites that I've had this month and
just in general I have been loving Lomo
saltado that is a Peruvian dish and I've
never had Peruvian food until I moved
here and one of Sam's co-workers like
recommended this place called Mario's
down in Hollywood on Vine Street I think
that's where it is anyway it was so
delicious it's basically like steak and
like really big cut up onions and
tomatoes and then like french fries and
then like a mound of rice and it's so
good it's so salty and like hearty and
like oh so good I like creamed it all
the time I absolutely love it so yeah if
you ever wanna like try some elegant
food if that's like probably one of its
like the most popular dishes or at least
I feel like it every time I go in
there's two different Peruvian
restaurants there's one really close to
us like up the street then we go to a
lot and that's what a lot of people get
there so yeah Lomo saltado that is one
of my favorites
definitely this month but just since
we've moved here and I've tried it it's
been delicious and I think the only
thing I have left are just like TV shows
so I have been loving Hannibal I
finished season 1 and season 2 basically
in April and um it's definitely a darker
show and it's very gory and it's
definitely course thriller style so if
you don't like that you probably won't
like the show but something about it the
whole aesthetic the way it's shot the
way that it looks is so beautiful like
it just looks so good the show looks so
good I think the actors do an amazing
job in that show and I just really
enjoyed it I will say that I fell harder
for it like during the second season
than I did for the first season I kind
of was just like forcing myself to watch
the first season but I
second season then I really can't wait
to see the third one I was watching it
on Amazon Instant Prime it was on prime
instant I don't know the reporter of
that but if you have that it was free
the first two seasons were free and you
can watch them instantly so yeah if
you're interested you could watch it on
there and then the other show I've been
loving is America's Next Top Model
this is show I can watch and Sam's not
here because he definitely doesn't want
to watch that show that's for sure I've
been watching I watched Season eleven
and or cycle eleven and cycle twelve is
what I'm watching now I get started like
somewhere in the middle like randomly
but that's also on Amazon Instant Prime
and I think you can like watch the first
like 19 cycles like for free on there so
that has what that is what I have been
streaming lately I've just been totally
obsessed with watching it I love I wish
though you know if someone could just
make a compilation of just like their
photos and the critiques and to went
home and then the photos and the
critiques and who went home that's
really all I care about but that's like
my favorite part I guess of the show is
just seeing those beautiful photos and
just kind of like hearing the critiques
just because I don't have anything about
fashion or modeling or anything like
that so it's just cool to hear what they
think about it I really enjoy it anyway
that is everything for this video guys
let me know what your favorites were in
the comments down below or our I hope
they're still your favorites and I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
