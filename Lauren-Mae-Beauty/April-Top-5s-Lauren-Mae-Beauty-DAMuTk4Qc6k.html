Lauren this is going to be my April top
5 favorites the first thing I want to
talk about is something that was
actually sent to me for review this is
from madam glam they contacted me and
wanted to send me a gel nail kit and I
actually have been wanting to look into
gel nails for a while I have a lot of
nail polish and for whatever reason I
just don't enjoy actually painting my
nails I love colors and I love having
choices and I'm never going to get rid
of all my nail polishes but they just
take a really long time like it feels
like this whole big process and the
thing that sucks about that is ok
finally I've worked my way up and I've
decided that ok I'm going to paint my
nails and then literally two days later
no matter really what they chip they
chip and I'm just like so sad and then I
have that chip nail polish on my nails
for like 2-3 weeks and it's still there
and looks tacky and it's horrible so is
excited to try out a gel brand to see if
it really does down your nails for a
really long time it does it's awesome
I've really been enjoying the longevity
of these nails and the fact that they
stay shiny and looking really nice for
the entire time they're on your nails
I've been pretty busy and it's just been
nice that even through set being on set
and just you know I can go a week almost
two weeks with this on my nails and the
only reason I have to change it out is
because it's growing out I just really
been loving it it's been really shiny
and all you do is cure them for 30
seconds between each coat between your
base coat your polish and your top coat
it's just really working for me it takes
a little bit shorter to paint my nails
with these and they're dry immediately
as soon as I spray the alcohol on them
and rub off the like tacky top they are
ready to go I can floss my teeth at the
end of the night I can go do the dishes
I could do whatever I need to do
immediately after and that's something
that was like I had to like plan out how
is gonna make my nails before like we're
watching a movie and it'll take two
hours to dry because I do kind of paint
my coats thick so anyway I just really
really been loving this I picked out the
color lilac pursuit which is a really
pretty lavender cream color I've had
these nails in a bunch of my videos
because as soon as they grow out I peel
them off which I know you're supposed to
to compile them and I just put it right
back on because I know that it's going
to be on my nails and I'm just gonna
look more put together and polished
polished then if I didn't have a polish
on I just really really been liking it
the other color I guess you could say
they sent me was a silver glitter and I
really do like this glitter it's quite
opaque if you wanted you could just
build up the glitter and have a glitter
nail I like to use it as just like a top
coat they did send me a coupon code for
you guys it's on an affiliate link I
don't get paid for any of it but if you
want to save thirty percent I'll leave
that code down below so that way if you
were interested in gel nails I just I
really been enjoying them so i'll leave
that link down below if you want to
check it out also let me know if you
want to see like a demo video or just a
more in-depth review on the gel nails I
totally get it I'm a beginner and I
definitely had to look up some videos
myself on how to do it and everything so
if you want that just let me know in the
comments down below I thought I would
mention this perfume I got this for
christmas from Sam it was his like big
gift to me and I'm in love with it as
you can see there's a lot gone and it's
April its work getting through april and
i've been trying to use up another
perfume in my project use it up for like
my monthly project use it up this just
smells so good and this is molecule let
me tell you what it is it's eccentric
molecules it is expensive it is so
beautiful though this is a unisex
perfume so men can wear at women can
wear it I love it and then Sam loves it
he's like I think i'm gonna start
wearing it because he loves it that much
too which makes me love it even more
that he likes it because then i want to
wear it it's so good it smells I can't
even describe the way it smells if you
have a place near you that sells us I
believe Barney's does sell this I don't
know any other places i'll have it
linked down below though in case you
want to check it out it just smells so
good i absolutely love it i can tell
when people are wearing this I've never
worn this and not got a compliment on it
I'm just obsessed with it this is going
to be like my number one go-to fragrance
in my collection once I weed out the
other things because I love it that much
so if you're ever wondering about this I
think you should just get it I got the
big one because I knew that I would just
love it and
I'm just obsessed I'm up so obsessed
with this I will say though if you buy
this you sometimes can't smell it on
yourself like it kind of like melds with
your own chemistry and you can't smell
it but you will still get compliments on
it so don't think it's not working or
that it's not not being smelt by other
people because it is it's just for some
reason you get used to it and it almost
becomes your own site so you can't
really smell it but it smells so good
another beauty product this one is for
hair this is from the brands I don't how
to say it still owe you I hawaii hawaii
i do not know if someone knows please
just tell me down below because i feel
stupid trying to say it this is
something I got in a generation beauty
my like gift bag that I got while we
were there this is a finishing cream and
it just feels so silky smooth in your
fingers you just need the tiniest bit I
like to like tame flyaways I have it
today because I had it out here for this
video but I like to like take any of
these types of hairs and just kind of
smooth it in it kind of controls it
without feeling like way down or greasy
or anything like that but it also
doesn't get crunchy or anything it's
just such a beautiful texture a
beautiful formula it does smell like
gardenias I want to say it kind of feels
like the chi fragrance and I believe
that's gardenia and if you like that you
might like this it doesn't smell to me
super fake it smells more like actual
fresh again like the chi sent I thought
that would be a turn off at first but
I've really grown to enjoy it and and
liked it so that's been nice and I just
really like this I'm definitely going to
purchase the full size once i finish
this and I'm really excited this year I
feel like I'm really finding some hair
products that are becoming like holy
grail for me and I think that I'm just
going to kind of keep it that way like
not really branch out too much maybe try
one or two things at a time and then you
know finish them up and try new things
but I really like that I just have a
standard hair care routine right now and
that's been really nice the last like
beauty favorite is going to be my makeup
eek shadows I know I just got the
but I don't care they're my favorite i
love them so much so i really like the
color desert sands here such a pretty
transition color something a little bit
different I know that max I think
unexpected or something like that i
think it was limited edition but it was
like an appropriate size i could be
wrong but if I think it's something like
that anyway that's a very similar color
and so is Bobby Brown's I think camel
but it just nice to have an affordable
option of this and something that's
permanent so I've really been loving
that shade I've really been loving
cupcake I used both of those in my look
today I do have a tutorial coming up on
that so um definitely look forward to
that once it's posted i'll leave it
linked down below what else have you
been living I don't know I just all of
them really honestly I really like the
color black out or black light let's let
me tell you the real name of it it's
black light that was so pretty again
that's like a dupe for tonic by urban
decay and then even shadows that I
haven't got in this recent haul i also
have been loving in the spotlight is
such a pretty color let's see if i can
that's it there hopefully you can see
that it's just beautiful and then I've
also been loving mesmerized which is
something a little different for me
because I don't usually go cool tone
which is also on my eyes today so I just
have been loving makeup geek shadows I'm
going to purchase more probably pretty
dang soon I'm just really in love and it
just took me a long time to order them I
don't know why but i'm really happy i
did and i'm really obsessed with them
and my number 5 favorite is a drink this
is from vitamin water it's the tropical
mango flavor you cannot find this flavor
everywhere it is hard to find some gas
stations have it some bagel places have
it at least in my experience that's
where I found it but costco does have
these and they come in a big old pack
because it's costco me and Sam recently
reupped our membership which it's like
Costco is like Disneyland for adults i
don't know i love costco my husband
loves costco so much so it was a pack of
20 vitamin waters for 1199 which is a
really good deal considering the retail
for usually a doll or something if not
to something when you buy them
places and it comes with eight of the
xxx 18 of the dragon fruit which are two
of the most popular colors and four of
these I'm sad that I can't just buy a
whole 20 pack of these because it's my
favorite flavor but I'm so glad to have
found a place to buy it I was
considering buying this online in like a
20 pack for like thirty dollars because
I didn't care like I just wanted it but
um I'm just glad i found a way to get my
mango fix and i just really like this i
love vitamin waters I'm someone who
really likes like a kind of like a
toned-down drink so like Sobeys I like
to like mix water in sometimes like
lemonade's and stuff are a little too
thick i like to water them down so
vitamin waters are my jam and
specifically the slaver is like what I'm
about I hope you guys enjoyed my
favorites I'm really happy that I really
loved all the things this month all the
things in this video or something that I
just truly recommend and love and
basically i'm surrounded by every day i
hope you guys enjoyed let me know what
some of your favorites are and if you
tried any of these things and if you
