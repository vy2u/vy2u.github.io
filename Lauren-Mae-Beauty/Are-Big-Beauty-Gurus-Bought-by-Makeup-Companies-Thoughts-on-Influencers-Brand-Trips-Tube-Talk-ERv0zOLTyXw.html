Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought we'd do another tube
talk and this one was actually requested
by someone for my last one so I'm gonna
leave the playlist link down below if
you haven't seen any of these or you
want to see more after this video this
is a series that I do on my channel
where I talk about just different things
I want to usually they have to do with
the beauty community and YouTube but
it's supposed to be just a place where
we can have actual dialogue and
conversation
yeah and discuss things in like a more
mature way we don't want to like hate on
anyone I really do want to encourage
people from all sides of a conversation
to leave their opinions down below I
think that helps us grow and learn as
people I always feel like I sound so
preachy in that beginning part I'm so
sorry but anyway let's get into today's
topic we're gonna be talking about brand
trips and my thoughts on them when it
comes to influencers and big makeup
beauty gurus going on these brand trips
and I know there are a lot of people
with a lot of issues about them and yeah
we're gonna get into it I feel like my
opinion on this is gonna be a little bit
more different than what people are
expecting but I think there's a there's
a lot in this whole situation so if you
guys don't know and haven't been
involved in the beauty community for a
while
brands like Smashbox and benefit and
tools has done a tart at art does a lot
of them they will take influencers like
the top Beauty influencers and they will
have them go on a trip with them to
usually a tropical location Hawaii Fiji
Bali all of those types of places and
they have them go there and usually it
coincides with some type of launch that
they're gonna have and they will kind of
use that as a way to have the
influencers go on a trip have a great
memory but also as promotion for that
new products they're going to launch
because obviously the influencer is
going to be posting about it on social
media and doing like a vlog about it
when they get back and yeah so it kind
of works those two things it's like
promotion plus a fun trip it's just
overall a good time like I said before I
feel like I have a bit of a unique
experience on this because of the fact
that I am a content creator I'm a very
small content creator but I do make
youtube videos
a makeup artist and so I have that side
of me but then I also have the side of
me that is someone who just watches
YouTube videos and enjoys seeing
people's reviews and I was a part of the
YouTube community like that before I
ever made videos so I guess the big
controversy is that people have problems
with these you know beauty influencers
going on these lavish lavish trips now I
feel like brands have backed off from
doing this lately like I do not see it
as much as I did there was a time when I
felt like seriously it was like every
month there was some type of big beauty
bash and the brands were like taking all
these people on these trips and I felt
like it was like every frickin time
something new launched which something
new launches all the time so it was
crazy but I feel like that could be
because there was a lot of backlash from
subscribers just seeing these insanely
lavish trips and and then these
influencers would come back and they
would talk about these products and of
course they'd be like these are the best
these of us you should buy them now I
feel like again there's a lot of play
there so I kind of think that the
biggest thing we need to break down is
like why are we mad because when you
break down each step of these I'm like
well why would even mad at that well why
would we be upset about that and I think
ultimately what it comes down to you
that is really sparking the most like I
don't want to say hate but just like
disappointment from people and
subscribers and fans is that these trips
signify that these influencers can be
potentially like bought by these brands
to then give a good review on those
products later on and then if those
products don't perform like they should
that kind of makes people lose trust
with the influencer they feel like their
loyalty lies with the brand instead of
with them the subscriber who put them in
the position to even go on this brand
trip in the first place I feel like I
see a lot of people just like talking
about the trip itself and like saying
that the trip is horrible or like into
me it's like I have no problems with the
trip like you cannot tell me that if any
one of you was offered to go on a trip
by such an amazing brand or well-known
brand liked art or Smashbox or benefit
or any of that that you would say no
there's no way in hell there's no way
that you're gonna be like no I'm
definitely not going on that now I don't
know what the requirements are I don't
know I mean I've heard Samantha Ravenel
talk about these trips before and how
sometimes you get paid to go on them and
it's like it is it's a business trip it
just happens to be awesome and fun and
it doesn't look like you know work but
they get paid to go some influencers
don't sometimes you don't like the trip
itself is kind of the thing and then you
get all that free product but you're not
getting like actual paid money to be
there and I'm sure it differs from
beauty guru to beauty guru depending on
the club they have or the management
they have or whatever and what they
negotiate with these brands but
regardless of if they're getting paid or
not there's no way you can tell me that
you wouldn't go on this trip so I don't
blame any of these people for going on
these amazing beautiful locations I mean
these are places that we can only dream
about going to that we put in our
Pinterest boards and hope we can one day
go too and so I think it's amazing and I
think we should celebrate the fact that
they've gotten to a place in their
careers where they are you know asked to
go on these amazing trips I think that's
amazing and I think we should celebrate
that another thing I hear a lot of is
the fact that they get so much makeup
and they get so many of these like
lavish other gifts like I know Tarte was
doing giving them like drones to do
stuff with and I think a lot of people
focus on the monetary value of these
things and I get that especially because
to the everyday person you know a drone
as like just a gift oh you know one of
many gifts seems insane and it is it's a
lot of money but it's like I can't be
mad at them for accepting a gift and I'm
not mad necessarily at tart for
necessarily giving these gifts it's
gonna make for some awesome footage
these vlogs are gonna be super awesome
which is only benefiting tart and that's
the thing this is a promotional trip you
know they sometimes they're just taking
these influencers out to like I think
reward them or just like give them a
vacation but ultimately it still ends up
in promotion so no matter how you break
it down this is a promotional trip for
the brand they're spending their money
here like they would for advertising
or any other marketing campaign and if
that's how they want to spend it and
they want to give it to influencers in
the form of drones or pay them or this
awesome like over the beach cottage or
whatever like that's amazing right like
I think that's still cool I mean I don't
ultimately see a problem with those
things necessarily you know what I mean
so I don't like hearing people complain
about that because I know I know as a
fact that if anyone was offered this
vacation they would take it so I think
being mad at them for taking this you
know opportunity or getting gifted all
of these things it's kind of like messed
up to them it's like they can't win you
know what I mean like why would anyone
say no to that another thing that I've
heard specifically with Tarte is like
when the shape tape came out I'm pretty
sure also when that like the Pro palette
with like the duochrome shades on the
side you know I'm talking about there
was kind of a lot of controversy because
one that palette did not do so well like
and a lot of influencers obviously
talked it up after you know it was like
revealed there wherever they were in the
tropics it just didn't get that many
great reviews now how much of that was
like potential backlash because of
seeing all this promotion I'm not sure I
mean some of the people that I trust
really well here on YouTube though gave
it bad reviews so I don't know if it's
just a preference thing because I also
know a lot of people who still use and
love that palette so that was a big
controversy as well as the Tarte shaped
ape was being given to them in every
single color and then a lot of people
had a problem because there were no
concealers in stock when Tarte was like
promoting this or when they were like
showing all this stuff like people
regular people can buy these things but
the influencers were getting like
multiple multiple shades of everything
and people were really upset about that
like you're giving them to these
influencers but you can't have people
who are actually wanting to pay for
these products it's not available for
them I see the frustration in that
totally I think that that's like a valid
point like you probably should have
things and stuff that you're probably
promoting at that time so that way
people can like buy them then and I
think that maybe the brand can think
about how things are gonna look when
like people are getting such lavish
gifts and then making sure that their
customers also feel like they're being
loud
they're not being like thrown to the
dirt since they are the ones paying for
the products like I totally get that
complaint but I also seen that shape
tape specifically was an insanely
popular product and so it was sold out
you know I don't know it's like things
are sold out people it's not life or
death um I don't think we need to get so
pissed off about it hopefully they're
working as hard as they possibly can to
get orders out and to get their like
stock replaced so that they can sell it
I mean ultimately that's their number
one goal of a company and a business is
to make the money so I'm sure if they
have the means to make that product
available as fast as possible I'm pretty
sure they would have done it it's not a
limited-edition item they're not like
holding stock back to like then try to
reprimanding influencers or the brands
they're giving people the shades because
they don't know everyone's shade so here
are all the shades do within what you
want like I do think brands could maybe
do a better job of knowing the creators
that are on their PR list and maybe
sending more targeted shade ranges to
those people instead of sending them the
entire collection but again if that's
how they want to market their product if
they want to give this artist the
ability to have all the shades and do it
do with it what they want that's up to
the brand and I don't necessarily think
it's wasteful when they're sending it to
people who literally their job is to
talk and reveal makeup so if they want
to show every shade of the concealer
they can you know whether an influencer
decides to do that or not is their
choice but they're giving them the
opportunity and sending them on the
whole line so they can make informed
decisions and hopefully inform their
audience about the products like I don't
think that that is necessarily bad
either like it's not necessarily
wasteful it can become wasteful if you
know influencers aren't doing anything
with that product but hopefully they're
doing good things and I think what this
ultimately gets me to is like I think
the biggest complaint and the real issue
at the core of this isn't necessarily
the trips is it necessarily all the
expensive gifts and all the extra makeup
they're getting it's like do you trust
your influencers do you trust your
beauty Gers and if you don't stop
watching them I totally get that with
these trips there is this tendency I
don't
I think anyone who went on this trip if
you met someone from tart and they
became your friend and you guys partied
and had a good time it was an amazing
time it's a memory in your life and then
they send you more stuff you would think
like oh remember Becky from tart and Oh
Gladys from benefit well they're so nice
and whatever so you do have a bond with
these people and so maybe you are not
gonna give as like you know brutally
honest of a review or maybe you would be
a little bit more choice with how you
present these items or you want to stay
on these lists to continue to go on
these lavish vacations that is I think
the biggest complaint is that the
loyalty shifts from subscribers to the
brands and I get that I think it's kind
of natural potentially for people to you
know kind of care about whoever took
them on the trip or want to go on a
vacation again to maybe not be so harsh
about it but that's where we decide with
our votes which are our subscription
lists and our views we vote on if we
trust this person and if they're gonna
be able to get the views and the sub
counts to go on these trips and if you
don't trust someone that's on you do not
watch them also we know for sure that
Tarte paid for them to go on this trip
and they were a part of kind of like
this promotional campaign for it so take
their review with a grain of salt I
think there's a bit of responsibility on
us I don't think that this trip is out
in the open this isn't a secretive thing
everyone knows that benefit is
sponsoring them to like basically go to
this vacation place and gave them all
this product and so when they come back
and they do a review and say this stuff
is all awesome um one you probably know
that it's probably pretty good
I mean it's benefit this is an
established well-known brand it's not
some Rando brand so it's probably pretty
good but if you don't trust this person
then don't watch the review or take
their review with a grain of salt and
try it yourself or just be wary test it
watch a ton of other reviews watch
reviews of art sponsor to people who do
go on the trips but ultimately I don't
think we should like fault these people
for wanting to go on these trips if
that's the situation because I know for
sure I'd want to go on a trip I would
still be honest and that's just
something that I
self in but if you don't feel like that
influencer is honest anymore then stop
watching them stop giving them the view
stop giving them your subscription and
make a change you know demand a change
by using your views and your
subscriptions and watch other people
make other people become big influencers
who will hopefully keep their integrity
and honesty and I'm not saying this
saying that these bigger influencers
don't have honesty and integrity I don't
know them they might they might not I'm
not sure I mean there's a lot of things
that go on behind the scenes that none
of us know about we can speculate all we
want but we don't know and I also think
that it's like you guys not every
product is shitty like not everything is
shitty some things are shitty um and
then there are a lot of products that
are just like okay and like work for
some people because it works for their
lifestyle or for what they like in their
makeup but maybe isn't gonna be
everyone's cup of tea and then I feel
like there are products that are super
stores no matter who you are everyone
loves them and that's just the way it is
but the amount of products that are just
crappy we can't expect these honest
reviews to just always be like this is a
piece of like I did a review
recently on Natasha Genoa and I
personally don't think it's worth the
money I'm not gonna return my palette I
do enjoy it and I see like that they're
nice but I just don't think that it's
worth the price but everyone has a
different opinion if you look at the
comments on that video some people like
thanks for being honest some people are
saying like I know it's expensive but I
love them they're worth it for me and I
think that's great you know that
everyone has a different opinion but
that's the thing everyone has a
different opinion on it guys and just
because my opinion was I guess more
negative on that palette doesn't mean
that mine's more honest than someone who
gave a good review to that palette if
they actually liked it and actually use
it and they think it's good that
something reviews are so unique to each
person I'm going off on a tangent I can
tell but another thing I wanted to kind
of get back to I was talking about how
these are out in the open and so it's
kind of our responsibility it's like
it's like an advertisement like if they
say this is a sponsored post by whoever
like I feel like at that point it's our
responsibility to know that well they're
getting paid for this so you know take
it as you will but this is not something
new
brands have taken people and I mean I'm
not even talking just makeup brands but
like companies take people out to dinner
out to lunch whatever like this happens
in all industries and just because this
is more apparent and more over-the-top
and like a show because it's YouTube and
because youtubers show everything we
freaking do on snapchat and Instagram
and everything it's like crazy how much
their lives are freaking out there it's
insane because that's the social media
aspect of it you're gonna know about it
a lot more and that's part of the
promotion of it but this has happened
before with like editors of magazines
being taken out to like talk about
beauty products and I think it's like
wrong to specifically demonize these
people because they are more well-known
and because it is more you know scene
and like out in the open I don't know I
don't have as big of a problem I get
like more than anything to me I'm just
like not petty but just like sometimes
can get annoyed saying like a million
things and like oh great you guys got
another drone one like how cool um and
I'm not like jealous like I'm happy for
them and again if it wasn't me I'd be
like hell yeah but I don't think people
should be so offended and so worked out
necessarily by it I don't know those are
just my thoughts and if you do think
someone is losing their credibility
that's kind of where I think the
frustration is and if that is happening
then I think you know it's time to
remove yourself from that situation and
let them be them like it's disappointing
and it's upsetting if you feel like
someone who was truthful or someone you
really liked has changed and you don't
think that's how they are anymore but um
you know we don't know these people we
don't know how true that is
and I think that a lot of things get
read into I think you know if someone
comes back from this trip it's automatic
like you're just bought by the company
but like what if that product actually
is freakin good it kind of sucks you
know like that sucks
I would hate for people to be like oh
you just like it because you weren't on
the trip and it's like I went on the
trip and enjoyed the trip and then I
also just like this product which
happened to be like what they were
launching on that trip like it's okay
for those products to be good I don't
know I don't know I think I touched on
everything I wanted to on this hopefully
I didn't forget anything I honestly feel
like
I'm kind of like removed from the
situation a little bit because it isn't
happening as often I feel like the last
one that happened was the Smashbox trip
and I I don't feel like that was nearly
as advertised as a lot of the other ones
were like again there was a time when it
was like the thing to take these
influencers on these trips but as always
I would love to know your guys's
thoughts down below whether you agree
with me or you disagree or you just have
a different opinion I would love to hear
it and just have a conversation I think
having those different opinions always
helps us make better decisions and just
understand other people's point of view
so let me know what you guys think down
below also leave any topics you want me
to talk about down below too if you have
something specific I'd love to talk
about it probably and that's everything
thank you so much for watching guys and
I will see you in the next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
