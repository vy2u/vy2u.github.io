Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another tube
top this is a series that I started on
my channel I think almost like a year
and a half ago where I'm talking about
topics in the beauty community or just
YouTube talks I don't know whatever I
want to talk about and I just want to
start a discussion I want to have like
an open place where we can talk about
pros and cons I think a lot of the times
when we talk about subjects things get
stripped down to like black and white
really fast and a lot of the time
there's a lot of nuance there's a lot of
gray space and you know I want this to
be a series where we can actually have a
dialogue and I love it because in the
comments you guys are always so great
and a lot of the times when I read
things I can think of things in a
different way than I ever did and that's
kind of what this is all about just
getting different perspectives and also
thought that I had a bit of a different
perspective because as much as I'm a
creator
I've always been an avid watcher of
YouTube before I started YouTube I
watched hours and hours of content I was
watching YouTube for like at least three
years before I started even like making
my own videos so that all being said I'm
gonna leave the playlist link down below
so you guys can check out other topics
I've done
today's tube talk is actually a collab
with page or a thrifty Beauty here on
YouTube she deemed me and was like hey
do you want to do a tube talk on this
subject
I'd love to collab with you and I was
like yeah girl let's do it she's awesome
if you guys haven't checked out her
channel definitely do her channel is
about being a conscious consumer she
loves makeup but she also wants to be
that voice of reason in a sea of other
people maybe telling you to buy things
kind of putting the brakes on a little
bit and be like do you really need this
do you not and so if you're into that I
definitely think you'd love our channel
definitely go check her out obviously
she will be linked down below I'm really
excited to see your her take on this
topic we were kind of going back and
forth talking about this a little bit in
her teens and today's topic is gonna be
asking the question are our expectations
for influencers too high and I really
wanted to bounce around a couple ideas I
actually wrote out a bunch of different
notes a while ago when we had decided to
do this collab so it's been a minute
since I looked at this stuff so it's
like stab my neck but it's been a second
since I've looked at this stuff and I
think that'll almost be a little bit
more interesting too I'm not like as
passionate about it as I was in that
moment
kind of coming at it with a different
perspective because that's something too
with this series that I've noticed is
like my opinions and everyone's opinions
change like depending on what you're
feeling that day or you know what
headspace you're in and so we're going
to be talking about that I want to talk
about my experience as well as things
that I've noticed and you know just how
I normally do the biggest thing with
this though I don't want to come off as
complaining if I'm talking about
something that is not it I'm super
grateful for the fact that I'm in this
position I have an audience that's an
amazing thing but I think sometimes
being in this amazing position of being
an influencer or having you know a
certain following on social media it can
kind of be like a monkey's paw situation
like yeah your your son came back from
the dead but he's also a zombie oh I
know that's a little bit extreme but you
know like there are positives that come
with it obviously amazing positives but
I think there are some negatives and one
of them I think is that something
happens when you are just a small crater
you're making your videos people like oh
man you're awesome I like you cool and
you're just like you're one of them like
they think of you as like your friends
and then all of a sudden I don't know
when the number gets too high but all of
a sudden you aren't one of them you're
somehow on a pedestal you're like not a
human anymore you're just thought of
differently and that's kind of where
this whole tube talk ideas stemmed from
and it's really weird because obviously
like you're still you but I've noticed
sometimes with my comments or just
different things that like people think
of me so much differently just because
the number next to my name has changed
with me and with page I feel like our
channels kind of jumped up in number
pretty fast so I had a couple growth
spurts in my channel life I've mostly
grown really organically and little by
little but I had some times where it was
like a really big period of growth where
I was doubling my subscriber base and
then doubling again like it was crazy
and it's weird because it happened so
fast that for me like I'm still me I
don't know like all of a sudden it's
like you know in a month you go from
being 6,000 to 15,000 or 15,000 to
30,000 or 30,000 to 50,000 and I still
feel sometimes like oh
like six thousand or ten thousand like
I'm I still feel very connected to that
number because all of this happened so
fast it never it's hard to sink in that
number and like we're supposedly I'm
supposed to be mentally or how I'm
supposed to read my channel because I'm
at a certain number and that's another
thing we'll talk about to me I feel like
the same girl I was making those videos
in September of last year
whereas when people see me I don't feel
like they see me that the same way
anymore I am NOT looked at as the same
girl with that same number next to my
name I'm seen as someone with a fifty
thousand number next to her name and so
I've noticed a trend that sometimes that
can like really reshape some of the
conversation on your channel in the
comments section one of the things I've
noticed is that people think you've
tried like every product on the market
and it's like no you have it like
sometimes that's really tough I'm like I
honestly sometimes think you guys have
tried more stuff than me because I'm
still only one person and I try not to
buy too much I mean I still like to buy
I like to have balance but I try not to
buy like every new thing that comes out
so sometimes I feel like you guys have
better knowledge of new products coming
out because I haven't tried everything
and so I try to make my comment section
like hey if you have a review leave it
down below let us know because I'm kind
of there with you like in a lot of my
videos I'm talking about things that I
haven't maybe tried myself I'm just
interested in or I'm like talking about
it in a different way than like a review
on it you know what I mean
I already need a little I know it's
because I feel like I'm already off so
let's see so anyway I'm gonna cap that
another thing that I noticed is that
like expectation and kind of like
demands on the channel become a little
bit more once you have more subscribers
I don't know what it is maybe it's just
the amount of people that percentage
obviously goes up because the numbers
gone up I don't know maybe that's
something I feel like sometimes you're
expected to do more things or do less of
something or not do something because
all of a sudden you're like a bigger
youtuber and I really hate that
something I've noticed a lot of recently
it's I've heard other creators be like
oh I only do this part-time as a hobby
to kind of like fend off backlash for
like stupid things like maybe they're
editing they don't like their editing
style or oh they don't like how they
something and they're like oh well I
only do this as a hobby like this isn't
my full-time job and first off yeah
that's bullcrap leave people alone let
them run their channel and also even if
your full-time YouTube you should do
whatever you want with your channel
that's something that I'm really
passionate about and something that I
love about YouTube is the fact that this
is a place for people to come on and
make their own rules like I know we're
in this larger scope of the beauty
community but you can run your channel
however you want you can come up with
your own format for reviews you can come
up with all of your own ideas and so
it's really frustrating for me to see
other people feel like they have to
defend themselves by being like a
hobbyist youtuber and so it's okay that
they don't do this or don't do that and
it's like it doesn't matter if you're
hobbyist or full-time or you post like
once every two years like you're allowed
to do whatever you want on your channel
and I think sometimes as viewers we need
to remember that that's kind of the
reason we like different people right
like we like because they do things
differently and it's okay and I'm not
saying that constructive criticism is
bad I'm just saying there's a point
where it's like a creators decision of
how they want to like run their channel
and that's okay it's okay for them to
run their channel how they want to and
that's part of it and that's kind of
where again we decide as a subscriber if
we like that if we want to be a
subscriber if we don't and it's okay if
you don't want to be a subscriber to
that person and it's also okay for them
to run their channel how they want to
that's something I just for sure wanted
to bring up because I've just heard it
so much I feel bad that people have to
be like no I don't do this full-time
like this is just for fun for me so
don't like attack me for this but then I
also don't like the message of that a
little bit because it's like even if it
was their full-time job they don't have
to do that either you know what I mean
that's just something I really want to
touch on specifically with this like the
expectations when it comes to editing
another expectation I feel like is you
know I'm a makeup artist and I'm not
sitting here saying that I'm the best
makeup person ever on on the youtubes
every day is different sometimes what
looks turning out sometimes my looks
don't especially with my new camera
sometimes I feel really nervous to post
a look or something but I honestly don't
have time to like refilm everything I do
like I'm a human too even though this is
my profession I'm still human we all
make mistakes we all maybe don't have
the best day blood
or we might not have the best color
combo and I feel like there becomes this
expectation that if you have a ton of
subscribers all of a sudden your skill
level is like amazing and like that
isn't necessarily true there are a ton
of amazing artists here on YouTube there
are so many people that are so talented
even some of the the bigger Beauty
youtubers that people think aren't
talented I think are still very talented
like let's get real they still have
really good talent and something I
really hate saying too is like I'll see
creators be like oh I filmed this but I
filmed it like seven times because I
didn't want this or this went wrong or
that went wrong and I'd get wanting to
have the best content and quality
content for your channel that you can
and sometimes it does like it benefits
you to re-film something you're like
glad I did that
but other times I feel like you can get
in this like loophole of like constantly
looking at your content with a very
critical eye too critical of an eye
honestly and you get into this cycle
because of some of the comments or just
some of the expectations you think that
your audience might have of you and
whereas at the beginning you probably
wouldn't have done that it just comes
with this pressure with all of these
this number and the more people that
have their eyes on you to be better and
be perfect and it can be kind of tough
you know like I'm not trying to only
bring up my experience here or anything
but that definitely is something that
I've experienced I've been super nervous
filming certain types of videos even
some of my tube tops like the bigger I
get the more nervous I feel for my tube
talks which I hate I hate so much I try
so hard to like get out of my head about
it but something that comes with having
more eyes on you another note that I
wrote down is that you feel like you
have to disclaim everything you have to
like say so perfectly what your
intention is and what your thing is
because people skew what you're saying
in a way that you aren't intending maybe
you didn't even like foresee and you're
like crap no that's not what I meant
and you feel like you have to defend
yourself against all of that so you kind
of like do it at the beginning you're
like no I don't hate you know this know
that so we all have these long
disclaimers and then on the
recited that you have people are like I
wish people when do disclaimers and it's
like the reason people do them is
because trust me we get the comments we
get the comments that are like oh my
gosh you just hate everything or like
you hate me because of this or you know
what I mean like we you see them like
the littlest things you get comments on
so you're trying to kind of like avoid
that backlash immediately and a backlash
is a very strong word a lot of the times
it is only a couple comments and usually
you have so many positive comments but
for whatever reason how our brains work
as much as you try to knock that one
comment out it is hard it's hard to
continue doing content without that like
comment coming into your mind maybe
someone comments on I don't know your
blush is really heavy one video it's
hard not to carry that into your next
video maybe when you're doing a tutorial
and like either explaining why you put
on a lot of blush or you know really
being finicky and fussy with your blush
because you don't want it to like look
bad like it did the other time or
anything like it's hard it's so hard to
fight against that criticism in your own
brain ok rechecking the notes rechecking
the notes but ultimately with all the
growth and as you grow as a creator how
I've found as I've grown as a creator I
definitely feel more pressure whether
that's because of me and like me just
putting the pressure on myself or
whether that is because of you know more
comments and more expectations put on
you from more subscribers you definitely
have to have a balance of like checking
yourself and ultimately I want to say
that you know when you look at some of
these other youtubers these huge people
whether they're in the beauty community
whether they're not whether there are
celebrity I don't care who you're
looking at everyone is just a person and
this is something I really like highly
highly wish people would think of but
it's like I am literally just a person
sitting in her house right now I wear
sweats and I go to the store looking
like a crazy woman a lot of the time
because I don't have makeup on and my
hair is really dirty I might be waiting
in line to make a return and some days
I'm like kind of upset and so maybe I'm
not like the nicest person just like you
guys just like you guys are and that was
another thing I kind of wanted to touch
on is like something that I felt
pressure on recently and this might
good thing I don't know I feel like I'm
a pretty nice person I try not to be
like just a bitch to be a bitch but um
something I as I my subscriber can't
grow something I have like this fear
that I'm going to be in a situation and
it's going to be an upsetting situation
somehow I'm upset maybe someone did
something wrong whatever and then maybe
being a little bitchy but also like I
feel obviously like this is how I should
be because this is not right and this is
justice and it's going to be like a
subscriber or some subscribers gonna see
it and then that's gonna be their
impression of me right is that I'm just
this bitch and then it's gonna be like
this big thing like thorns a bitch and
it's like no it was just like that one
time it was like a one situation but
that's something I've had I've been
thinking about a lot lately for whatever
reason but that's another thing too I
feel like a lot of times situations like
that that if if a normal person were in
them wouldn't be blown out of proportion
wouldn't be looked at in necessarily the
same light someone that's an influencer
or someone who has a certain amount of
social media subscribers can't feel
those same things can't be a human like
that is being human right like sometimes
you're in the wrong and you shouldn't
may be said that or you should have
maybe done that I'm gonna talking about
like huge massive mistakes I'm talking
about like more you know like
run-of-the-mill little things or
whatever I feel like everything's read
into everything's really scrutinized and
looked at under a microscope and you
know it's sometimes it's just not that
deep but it all of a sudden becomes deep
because you have the subscribers and I
feel like that is definitely like where
we have too high of expectations for
influencers like they're literally just
people that more people know about I
said that before but that's the truth
they're just people that more humans
know about that's it there's nothing
else to it that is what popularity is
just more people know about you and
potentially like you or just like you
sometimes it doesn't matter there's more
people know about you you have more buzz
about you for whatever reason but that
doesn't immediately make you better
it doesn't make you worse it doesn't
make you any of those things except that
you're known more so yeah so that's kind
of a big thing for me I think I have one
more kind of topic I feel like this
one's been really choppy so I'm really
sorry it's not as like segwaying into
other topics but
I wrote this a long time ago the last
thing I wanted to talk about it's kind
of this moment with your subscribers
where I feel like there's this switch
all of a sudden where
subscribers feel like you owe them
something and I want to say up front
that yes obviously you could not be
successful at YouTube if people didn't
like you if people didn't subscribe to
you you wouldn't get the same
opportunities so there is this level of
like your subscribers did help you get
where you are and that's amazing and I
know that every youtuber is so grateful
for that I mean they're not usually
expecting it you know it's like this
crazy thing like holy crap this many
people actually liked my content enough
to subscribe to me or like my
personality enough to subscribe to me
but I feel like there's a line kind of
where that stops and there is a side of
it where this is because this creator
has worked really hard they put out the
content they've come up with creative
ideas they spent the time editing videos
when they could have been out with
friends when they could have been going
to sleep when they could have been doing
all these other things like there is
this level of effort that is the
creators part so I really eat when I see
a comment that's kind of like you have
all the success because of us like you
owe us or it's something along the lines
of that that has that feeling to it and
it's like yes a part of that is there
and it's like if you don't feel like I
said youtuber is like 100 percent
grateful for that baseline of like the
fact that you guys are there watching
them then you should just get out of
there because there's nothing you can do
to change that or whatever if like
that's the feeling you get from that
youtuber don't support that but
youtubers don't owe you anything like
you know in a lot of ways to to me I
honestly it's like these larger
youtubers like kind of don't owe their
subscribers like they don't need to make
content that only you will like or they
don't have to post a million videos a
week or a month if they don't want to
like I still think there's this like
part of the Creator that they can make
their own choices on their channel and
decide what they want to upload when
they want to upload like they aren't now
your slave where you've made them
popular and now they owe you their life
for the rest of their life and you know
what I mean like I don't want this to be
taken the wrong way and like in a
negative way or anything like that
because I just think there's also that
side I think I just hear the other side
a lot and I want to
that side out because one of the things
I think that makes a channel special or
unique or that people want to subscribe
to it is because someone is making
choices and making a channel where
they're themselves they're being
authentic they're doing things they want
to do not necessarily following trends
there may be creating trends they're on
the cusp of making new trends and then
there becomes this time where they get
so big that they they want to shove them
back down into the trends and it's like
no no I want to do what I want to do I
want to make content I want to make and
I never talking about I'm talking about
like the larger eye of like as a
youtuber one you know I mean that's just
something I wanted to point out I think
sometimes people want to rob you of your
own success and they want to say like oh
we got you there it's because of us and
and again part of that is 100% true
especially on social media and YouTube
you need the followers to be successful
but there's also this other side of like
yeah but like I also did the work like I
also was the one who did a lot of those
things and I'm kind of being like a
little Taylor swifty here but there's
that moment where she talks about you
know there's so many people who want to
take your success away once you have it
they want to claim your success they
want to say that they're the reason that
you're there and that isn't that is
always the case and I think sometimes
that is a really big expectation that I
see that comes along with a lot of
people getting bigger it's a comment
that I see a lot that I just wanted to
kind of address the other side of it
since obviously I am a creator myself
like I see the side of like being a
subscriber and wanting content from
people and you know you want to see them
you want to see the videos that they
create you want them to post as much as
possible because you just like love them
you want to support them but with that
love I think there should also be
respect for them as a person realizing
that they're humans they're not super
like superhuman
they don't have superpowers they have
other things in their life they're
dealing with stress and anxiety and all
these things just like the rest of us
sometimes on a different level because
of the things that come with social
media all of the comments all of the
criticism whether it's positive negative
mean comments nice comments it's just a
lot to take in and I think a lot of
people again don't really consider all
of those mental aspects on some more
news in this position there's so many
amazing things they're going on vacation
they're doing all these things and those
fun things to show but some of the
things that aren't shown are all of the
all of the self-doubt the questioning
being nervous to upload something hoping
that something doesn't get taken the
wrong way all of that stuff also comes
along with it again kind of monkey's paw
thing it seems like you want to be an
influencer or maybe that's one of your
goals or you're trying to do that and
it's like yes it's amazing there's so
many great things but sometimes there's
like be careful what you wish for
because you just might get it oh and
then some Yuto anyway I think I'm gonna
end this video here I wanted to try to
keep this as light-hearted as possible
and really just kind of discussion I
didn't want it to get too negative I
didn't want it to get too too little you
know what I mean because it is a tough
situation especially being a creator but
also being a subscriber and I'm talking
to subscribers and I just don't want it
to come off at all like I'm complaining
about anything this is such a privileged
thing to do I think
but with that there comes a lot of
pressure and I feel like responsibility
that we put on ourselves but also
subscribers put on us and ultimately at
the end of the day we're all just people
living on this world we make mistakes we
do things that are maybe not right in
the moment we try to apologize or make
up for them we're just people just like
you I think sometimes trying to look
through with that lens really can help
have some empathy for your fellow man
yeah that's it just have empathy man try
to put yourself in other people's shoes
really listen to them and ultimately if
you don't like someone and you don't
support them get them out of your life
and stop watching them and stop
supporting them and support the people
that you do love that's ultimately what
everything comes down to when it comes
to social media if you want things to
change then you got to not watch it you
got to support the change you know so
anyway thanks so much guys I hope you
enjoyed the video definitely go check
out page I'm excited to see her side of
this and her take on this subject I
can't wait to see your answers comments

with I kinda want to talk about the
vocal minority and how I feel like it
applies to youtube I kind of want to
talk about full time youtubers and just
like making money online and how people
get really weirded out by that crap I
don't know those are like the two that
are kind of like on my list
I kind of want to go into sponsorships
