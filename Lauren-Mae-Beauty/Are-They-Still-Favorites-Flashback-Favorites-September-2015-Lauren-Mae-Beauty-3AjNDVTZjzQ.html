Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm gonna be doing a flashback
favorites video I've really been
enjoying starting this series on my
channel going back and looking at like
this moment in time where I had a
certain favourites right now I'm in like
2015 and it's really interesting to see
what was my favorite I will leave the
original video link down below which was
my September favorites video and I just
like look like a different person I feel
like and it's just it's so interesting
and like such a blast from the past like
watch that video it's a bit cringy like
I always say so if you're if you're down
for that enjoy even just looking at how
much my quality is like gone up and how
much more comfortable I am in front of
the camera it's it's so crazy because I
thought I was comfortable in front of
the camera then if you like these videos
too I will leave the playlists of the
ones I've done in the past but let's
just get into it for the September
favorites that I mentioned I honestly
don't have any of them with me I've
either used them up or they've gone bad
like they're a product that expires more
easily than like something like a blush
or a powder product so that's kind of
exciting I definitely was in like my
project pan heyday when I was putting
this video up so I was very focused on
using up a lot of the items in my
collection and it's really cool to see
that those items are no longer here I
don't even like remember half of these
like loving them as much as I I guess I
did at this point but that's something
to that's really interesting is that is
because they're your favorites for the
moment doesn't mean that they're always
gonna be favorites but then there are
some of those items that you do look
back really fondly on and you're like oh
wow that one is like a favorite favorite
like a life favorite not a month
favorite a life favorite anyway let's
get into the first item do the first
thing that I mentioned in the video is
the Clinique bottom lash mascara now I
remember when everyone was talking about
this on YouTube it was like the thing
everyone loved it this is a product that
retails for $10 and it's just a really
tiny little spoolie with mascara on it
obviously and it's for the bottom lashes
so if you have like smaller lashes or a
wand that's like a normal-size for your
upper lashes it's too big
this one can really wiggle in there and
coat your bottom lashes I really like
this product I still think of this very
fondly I haven't repurchased it since
because I feel like I don't have as many
issues with
product transferring like I was talking
about in that video so maybe it has to
do with the concealer I was using back
then that would just like make mascaras
transfer other than that one but I think
if that sounds like something that's
interesting I think you'd really enjoy
this product I think $10 is a pretty
fair price especially because it is
Clinique which usually has a bit of a
higher price point so that's something
that like in the future I could see
myself maybe buying especially if I
started finding that I was having a lot
of transfer on my bottom lashes I would
look into it but right now I'm satisfied
the next two items that I mentioned were
both from a Korean beauty haul that I
had done previously so I'll leave that
linked if you want to check it out one
of them is like another product that was
like really raved about basically like a
year or two before I bought it then so
even now like I don't feel like really
anyone talks about it but it was the
dolly wink eyeliner it was a brush tip
eyeliner pen and it was really nice it's
not something that I would purchase now
I believe it's like about twenty dollars
very similar to the Kat Von D I just
feel like the Kat Von D one is more
accessible there's also the Physicians
Formula one I just don't even do
eyeliner like that as much as I used to
you guys know I usually don't do
eyeliner this is like pretty intense for
me so that's not something that I would
repurchase now I probably wouldn't spend
that much money on a pen like that since
I know I don't use it a ton but it was a
really nice one and I really did like
the flexible tip so that one was good
and then the other product that I
mention is an eyebrow pencil and this is
from the brand babyface I believe or it
could be its skin I don't know it was
hard to tell which one but it was a brow
pencil in number 0-3 and this is kind of
a fatter brow pencil kind of like the
Anastasia brow definer I had kind of
that teardrop shape and I talked about
how I really liked how it got the front
part of my brows and I could have it
like one way and then I could turn it
like flat and it could be skinnier I do
my brows entirely different than I did
in that video so that is something that
I might still enjoy today but I would
not use it in the same way I would not
use it as heavy as I did and I
definitely like a more fluffy brow I
like really showing the hairs of my brow
and back then I was doing something a
little bit more blocky a little bit more
intense there was a lot going on and I
was really into them which you know I'm
just glad we've moved on I'm glad we're
in a different
of Brau life so yeah not necessarily a
bad product I'd be interested to see
actually how I like it now and how I
would use it differently because many
products you can use in different ways
and get different results so I think
just in general I was very heavy-handed
before with my brow products the next
product that I mentioned was from Laura
Geller and it was the French vanilla
baked highlighter this is something that
is still an all-time favorite something
that I highly recommend I actually
totally panned the one that I was
talking about in that video used it up
entirely so I'm really proud about that
it's definitely something that I
repurchase something that I suggest this
highlighter has a really nice finish on
the skin it's gonna give you a bit of a
glow but it's not going to emphasize
texture it's not going to be super
metallic or anything like that so it's
definitely great for people who want
just a more subtle look and I really
enjoy it just like brightens the
cheekbone without adding too much
shimmer so that is a great product
definitely something that's just like a
life favorite next I talked about the
Tarte CC primer stick I had the shade
fair and this was something I had
ordered off of the Tarte website and
like a kit I don't know it was back in
my days where I would just literally buy
everything I wanted everything always
that was something that I had panned
again I've panned it completely I don't
have it anymore by this time it would be
like way too expired
anyway I would not repurchase this I
don't think you can I think it was like
discontinued when I was talking about it
then so I can't get that product anymore
but I still am interested in products
like that so I love the Lancome tint
Edel foundation stick which has like a
medium coverage I feel like it's very
similar I really want to try the nude
sticks blur kind of like priming
foundation type of thing that's new that
seems like a very similar product so I'm
still definitely attracted to the ease
of a stick and how fast it is how easy
it is and kind of the lighter coverage
in just a simple look so I wouldn't buy
that again but I do really enjoy
products like that this was also very
similar to these steal a CC cream sticks
which I talked about in the favourites
before that so a good product but I'm
glad that I used it up and it's not here
anymore
the last two products that I mentioned
were skincare products so the first one
was from Roe DL I believe that's how you
say it and it was the dragon's blood
firming
anok acid cream I remember this so well
I was working at a beauty store and we
sold this product it retails for almost
$100 and for whatever reason costco got
it for like $25 and so you guys know me
and how much I love Costco so I went and
I think I ended up buying like three for
my mom a couple for the people at work
and then I think I at one point had a
backstop of like four and one open like
I was like buying so many of them cuz I
really did enjoy this cream it's like a
thicker cream but it doesn't feel greasy
on the skin it sinks in really nicely
you do feel a bit plumped and firm it
has a really nice like fruity scent but
it's not overpowering so it's a great
product I wouldn't pay the hundred
dollars for it and it's been a long time
since I've used it but it is definitely
something that I enjoy I can like think
of the smell right now it was really
nice
so I'm glad that I got it at such a
great discount and yeah that was a good
one if someone were to ask me like hey
have you tried this what do you think I
would say to go for it if that was in
their budget and like all those points
made sense for their skin it was really
nice product and then last I had a
product from a very expensive skincare
brand
it was the Natura - say vitamin C mask I
had gotten this as gratis from work and
this mask specifically only retails for
$40 so it's not too bad just to let you
guys know some of the items in this line
retail for like seven hundred dollars
five hundred dollars for some serum so
yeah it suspensive it was one of those
ones that like I never sold anyone on I
was like the worst at it because I'm
just like are you sure you want to spend
your money on this you could buy a used
car on Craigslist for that price I'm not
good at hard selling let me tell you
that the mask was nice I didn't end up
actually finishing that product I passed
it on I'm just not very consistent when
it comes to masks it's definitely
something I want to be better at and
like do weekly like two different masks
a week so I'm working on that it smelt
really nice it was like this souffle
kind of texture and I do think that it
did like brighten my skin and make it
just look like really glowy and
moisturize so if for whatever reason I
was able to get that back in my life I
would enjoy it for sure but it's
definitely not something that I'm like
pining after or missing it was nice
while I had it but I wouldn't I wouldn't
pick it back up so so those are all my
beauty product favorites I had a few
songs that I mentioned the first one I
just mentioned in general Justin Bieber
and I went on about this whole spiel of
how it used to work at justice and how
Justin Bieber used to play and like I
have a lot of memories with Justin
Bieber especially like my world and my
world 2.0 definitely yes and memory is
there and I do I still love Justin
Bieber I still love those old albums I
love the acoustic one I'm a Justin
Bieber fan so I still enjoy him I don't
have any current favorites right now
that I'm into but that's still relevant
in my life another favorite that I had
was Michael Jackson's PYT love that song
so so good
so so good so that's like still like a
definite favorite like I can always get
down and jam to that song and then
similarly to that I had a song by Jim
Crow see I think that's maybe how you
say it I love the song operator at the
time which again I still really love
that I also really loved walking back to
Georgia so I really just enjoy that song
and the reason that was a favorite at
the time is because it was like heavily
featured in the show transparent which I
also mentioned as a favorite and we
started watching the show kiss Anne was
an extra on the show that show is like
really big for us specifically because
he was bumped during that show so he
became SAG eligible because he was able
to say a line and like Jill Soloway
picked him to say line and stuff and it
just has like a place in our heart
because it's like you know like a really
big exciting thing for just being there
for an extra and then getting bumped
getting the pay raise we still get
residual checks from it so it's really
awesome um and it was just like this big
moment and like kind of like the biggest
thing that had happened to us living out
in LA at that point so yeah transparent
is a favorite it's a great dramedy where
you feel a lot of things but you have
these moments of like respite where you
can kind of laugh off things so yeah I
enjoyed that show I enjoy the first
season a lot more than the second season
which are the only two I've watched and
then last I mentioned like just a
vampire I was really into vampires
I had read Dracula and that was a really
great book I highly suggest it it's
quite a long book but it is in like
letter format so I found that to be more
interesting and kind of kept me going
- yeah Brahm Stoker's Dracula was a
favorite I also at this time had watched
interview with the vampire which I
hadn't watched before
really remember that movie fondly I
don't remember like hating it but I
definitely don't remember like loving it
so I'm not sure about that one I do love
True Blood though and just in general I
talked about how I was into kind of this
like sexy dark story which is definitely
is something I enjoy so yeah I still
like vampire stuff like I do like
vampire stuff okay anyway so that's
everything guys I hope you enjoyed this
flashback favorites it really is so cool
that I'm able to look back at my
favorites because I have all these
videos that have like documented what
I've enjoyed and it's so interesting
just to see how much I've changed how
much my collections change how much of
my thoughts have changed or how much
they haven't and how much I'm like yes I
love it still of those vampires but
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
