my empties for august i actually don't
have that many empties because i think
i'm just working through a lot of stuff
right now a lot of stuff is almost
finished so i'm just going to show you
guys what I used up his mind that
doesn't mean that i started it and
finish it this month it's just what i
actually completed so i only have a
couple of like makeup related items so I
have this deluxe a sample of tarts
primer this is the clean slate primer
and it was just really small in this
little jar I used it at makeup school
during the day when I was like putting
makeup on so that's how I went through
it so fast I thought this isn't okay
primer I didn't feel like it hydrated
enough though so I just it's not my
favorite it smelt really nice though it
did have a fragrance but I liked it yeah
it was okay I wouldn't repurchase them
this is like a tiny little sample this
is Smashbox is poreless primer I really
like this I really like this one it's
very similar to the one by tart but this
one just has more moisture it moves
better across the skin so that's why I
liked it more and I like pairing this
with another primary so i'll put a
primer all over my face and then i'll
put this just in my t-zone and just
where i have texture issues and i find
that it really helps keep me mad all day
long especially in conjunction with the
covergirl three-in-one foundation like
I'm Matt all day long it's crazy so I
really like this i'm probably going to
buy this full-size once i move through
some more primers I hope my lips like
okay I know they're super dark and they
might be like any given but I went for
it today and last for like makeup type
of items this is from wrong way this is
from fresh it's their sugar lip balm
this is just a small one it's just their
regular treatment lip balm and I was
looking through my collection because I
have another one of these in one of my
project pans and this was like there
were like seriously I got two uses out
of this so I was like I might as well to
use it up and get it out of my
collection so I didn't dig in because I
don't have time for that but i did
finish it up i used it twice and it was
gone on to like skin care type of stuff
i have totally gone and gotten some
wipes these are the simple ones i really
I'm using another pack now they were on
sale at my like Ralph's for only 350 or
something if you bought like a bunch of
stuff in the sale and I thought that was
really good deal so I picked up to and I
do really like it so i think that i will
probably repurchase i just like using a
white one for lazy days just a wipe but
if not just to like get on my makeup off
and then I'll go in with like a cleanser
and actually wash my face and then I
just feel like especially with thick or
foundations I'm not just cleaning to get
my makeup off I'm actually cleaning the
skin on my face so that's why I like
them but this is a really nice one it
doesn't burn my eyes and I find that I
can use one wipe and get mostly
everything off so I like that this is um
melaleuca oil or tea tree oil and me and
Sam use this unlike anything we need to
we can use it as like a spot treatment
on blemishes we'll use it whenever he
dresses any wounds i have not that i'm
getting hurt all the time but anything
like that he'll use this as like a
disinfectant so we went through like a
bottle of basically tea tree oil this is
the realest still micellar water this is
very similar to bioderma or the simple
one i got this for free from work like
she gave it to me it's one of their best
dollars it's really nice it doesn't burn
my eyes it doesn't leave a residue it's
just like all those other micellar
waters and I would I don't know if I'd
repurchase this one but I do have
another bottle cuz i got it for free
again so yeah I mean I'm totally
enjoying using it i would suggest it to
someone because i think it works well if
you have the money to spend why not go
with this one but if not the simple one
works really well if you're looking for
like a budget option this is the epic
urine protein missed enzyme toner i was
using this from work i got it and it was
like here and i just took it home um I
don't notice anything special I don't
even know what this is supposed to do
haven't been trained by Epicure at all
so I was just using it but like after it
cleansed my face before I put like a
serum or moisturizer on and it was okay
it smelt okay I don't know I don't
really know what it did so i probably
wouldn't repurchase it but i also don't
know what I didn't know what
look for or what I was doing so may I
don't know no I probably wouldn't her
purchase but I used it I used up a whole
jar of this jurlique nighttime
moisturizer it's called the herbal
recovery night cream this is supposed to
help firm and I did drop it so the cap
is like busted but it's all used up in
there there's like the tiniest but not
enough for even a full face this smell
very herbal it surely gives more of like
a natural brand I thought this was an
okay night cream if you're looking for
firming I didn't necessarily notice any
of it but the biggest thing for me is
this wasn't moisturizing enough and I
think it's just because it's supposed to
be firming it doesn't leave like a very
emollient creamy moisturizing feel on
the skin said it does kind of almost dry
down Matt and um gives a little bit of a
like you can kind of feel a firming
effect whether it actually does
something I'm not sure I got it again
for free I wouldn't purchase it but i
would probably I mean if another one
came along i'd use it if you're looking
for something that's firming and you
don't have like overly dry skin or you
don't want a ton of moisture i would try
it but i would definitely try something
else before buying this again or using
this again this is a little deluxe a
sample of the Murad skin smoothing
polish I really like this product it
comes out kind of like a pink paste and
it's just a really good exfoliator for
the face it's just really good i liked
it i would definitely consider
purchasing it I think there's either
good exfoliator zorb addicts folios
there's nothing really in between either
you like it and you like a certain type
and anything that falls into that type
you basically will like or it doesn't
and there's like three beads and it
sucks so this is one of the good ones
and if you're looking for one this one I
would check it out and then last for
skincare I believe yeah kind of um is
this glam glow was super mod clearing
treatment little sample I use this as a
spot treatment on a like blemishes so to
Sam I think it just works really well I
find that it helps treat the blemish but
it also doesn't dry out my skin and I
find that sometimes when i use those
really like acne fighting ones that are
so secure rid of it in 24 hours it just
like drives my skin out so much that
when i put makeup on top of it just
flaky and that's not what I want either
so I had some of these samples at work
so I took a couple and I definitely
would repurchase this mask it's just one
of the ones that it kind of dries up
fast so if I'm going to purchase it I
need to like have a game plan of like
using it up in a you know decent amount
of time so that i get my worth out of
the product I have to hair type of
products this is Battiste this is the
floral and flirty blush sent I really
like this I get mine from Marshalls for
599 that's like the only place I'll
really buy them because other than that
they're like eight dollars and then at
my work we sell them for like 12 like
it's crazy so that's what I like to get
them i wouldn't even purchase them for
my work with my discount because it's
cheaper to get them at marshalls so if
you're looking for Battiste that's where
i suggest you buy it I mean Marshalls
each store carries different products
but I almost can always find it there
and then this is a Renee 40a I think
it's how you say it this is the
notorious frequent new shampoo it's kind
of just a very basic shampoo that you
can use every single day it's not going
to really do anything special but wash
your hair I thought it was okay the cap
is kind of interesting like you push
this button and it pops down by itself
it took me a while to figure that out
like I was breaking my nails trying to
open it the thing I didn't like about
this was the fact that it's very runny
so like so much product comes out I wish
the consistency was better or that it
wasn't like a tube like this like it was
a pump I think it would be just a better
way to dispense the product and then the
smell on this just to let you guys know
is very herbal I liked it it kind of
felt like my hair was really clean with
like lawn clippings or something but in
a fresh way but it was very herbal and
it smelt nice to me I liked it so i
probably wouldn't repurchase because if
I'm gonna wash my hair I usually wanted
to do something for me but I think it's
good if you just have nice hair it's not
color treated it's not anything this one
just kind of gets the job done if you're
really simple I would check it out last
two things I have
I only finished the last of my dollar
store cotton squares these suck I would
not repurchase them right now I have
none though so I almost wish I had
something even these but I like the
target ones probably the best but any of
the ones that are like cotton circles in
an encapsulated little thing not like
this whispers ones then I like them and
the last item this is Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
endless summer hand soap and as you can
see there's still product down here and
I've talked about this before but I just
hate that bath and bodyworks soaps you
can't use them all the way down to the
bottom I've tried putting water in them
and like shaking them up to try to use
the rest of the product but if you do
that then the product is still liquidy
and when you squirt this it squirts at
you it's crazy and you're like outfits
ruined for the day it's just annoying
and and then I don't have time to sit
there and pump for like I'm not even
saying like being lazy I'm just saying
like it just doesn't work so I wish they
would do something about that but you
know I saw the chameleon to go through
and that's everything for my empties
this month I'm not like a billion I'm
jeez but definitely good progress
getting some stuff out and then I should
have hopefully a few good ones next
month I hope you enjoyed this video and
I will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
