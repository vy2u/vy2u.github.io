Lauren oh don't mind me if I fast with
my hair because I'm wearing it down and
I normally don't but I'm trying to like
make it through the day really trying
cuz no it's not that bad right anyway
let's get into my empties these empties
have been collecting probably for about
almost two months and a little bit off
I'm not doing like a monthly one at
least I haven't been the last couple of
months just cuz I've been really busy
you guys know like let's stop talking
about it yeah let's just get into what
I've used up I'm not gonna do make a
first I'm just gonna go for it because
it's kind of a lot of stuff and it's
just gonna take forever so the first big
thing here on top this is alcohol it's
91 % I get it from CVS or anywhere that
sells 91% I need a minimum of ninety-one
percent alcohol for my alcohol activated
pallets I've talked about that before if
you guys want to know more about that
like ask me down below or I can maybe do
a video on like special effects stuff
although I'm not like an expert but yeah
that's what I use this for me and Sam
also use it in spray bottles to just
sanitized things throughout the house
and different things so I go through a
lot of alcohol I have two different dry
shampoos this month this is the rock
your hair dry shampoo I had a sample
size of this from generation beauty and
then i bought the full size at marshalls
because this was 7 99 cent of twenty
dollars so i did like the sample and i
was like so i'll get you know the full
size for a discounted price i enjoy this
it just does not work as good though
it's not the tease I don't know what it
is why I want to try other dry shampoo
when one all the other direction pues
have the aluminum in it and this one
doesn't so already its winning and then
on top of that this is just the best dry
shampoo so i don't know why i am still
searching for another dry shampoo when I
found my holy grail I should just buy
this i recently bought like four cans of
this at marshalls for 479 a piece such a
great deal usually they're 599 there so
I definitely suggest hitting up your
marshals I don't know if it's because it
was back to school or what but I like
bought four cans probably should have
bought more but anyway it's still good
don't get me wrong it's just this is
just the best and if you do have darker
hair though I do suggest going with the
colored ones
it can leave a white residue and if you
don't have time to really brush it out
then that's what I suggest but I have
light hair so I get I'm kind of lucky in
that way so I love it it's just the best
I guess more hair products this is the
unite texturizer spray I got this as
gratis originally and then I wouldn't
repurchase it Sam uses this and his hair
to add texture and kind of give himself
a little bit of like hold and kind of
that second day hair type of feel on
first day here he really does like this
I'm gonna try to find something else
texturising because this is just
expensive this is like $32 and
everywhere I can purchase stuff I never
see you night so it's not like I can get
a discount and I mean I purchase it
again full price I just would like to
try some other things this is a travel
size of the Sebastian shaper hairspray
this is the shaper just regular shaper
it's not the shaper plus so many people
buy these in the stores that I've worked
at they like love this is like
everyone's all-time favorite and it is a
really good hair spray I use this up on
set I was doing like a short film
earlier this month and it was just
perfect to have in my set back to pull
out and use and I used it up quite fast
so I definitely think i'm going to
repurchase the big size and then just
keep this one on set for like little
things I found that the other hairspray
i have just doesn't work as well as this
so i was just using this all the time
instead of using the other one that's
bigger so i definitely want to
repurchase this and i think maybe the
last hair thing will see this is the
color brilliance brights I on lavender
semi-permanent hair diet I had my hair
purple at the end of July into August
it's faded out now and then I used this
like shampoo that my mom got me that
color's your hair and it's a light pink
I've only used it once but I'm thinking
hopefully it'll kind of build the color
up if I keep using every time I'm in the
shower but anyway I did enjoy this this
is the type of die I by whenever I dye
my hair it's pretty inexpensive I get it
at Sally's I enjoy it it washes out
pretty dang fast but I've only had a
color that washes out fast so this is a
body wash this is the fleur de France
body wash bubble bath in the scent pure
eucalyptus this not really nice this is
not like a bath and Bodyworks type of
eucalyptus this is definitely like a
strong almost like a Vicks
product it smells really nice me and Sam
kind of used it mostly Sam I like this
because it is a more natural it was a
nice thing I thought this as gratis when
I used to work in a beauty store so I
did enjoy it i thought i was really nice
but it's gone now i have a brush cleaner
this is the Berman industries brush
cleaner i really like this brush cleaner
though it's like purple it has a vanilla
scent it cleans my brush is really nice
about leaving greasy residue it dries
quickly i really want to repurchase this
because i do not like the cinema secrets
I'm like the only one in the history of
the world to not like that I do like how
fast it dries and i like that it you
know it cleans my brushes fairly well
but it gets clogged in the stopper of
everything I put it in and I can't have
it I need something to spray my bread
like I like to spray boom boom boom get
them done get my brushes washed when I
have downtime and I have another person
or talent coming in I just don't like
that about that one so I want to
repurchase this one I definitely like it
too more cotton round things done I
think I only have like one more maybe
two more of the ones that I don't like
from big lots so I'm excited to almost
be done with those uh we weren't
surprised hello these are the makeup
wipes that I use these are the fpl I
always gonna have to say it but aloe
vera ones i really like these these are
dollar at big lots i stock up on them i
recently went to big lots to stock up
and they only had like the 60 packs
which are two dollars it's like the same
thing but it's double but the thing
that's really nice as they have like a
actual closure on them so i feel like
it's nice for my kit that they're not
gonna look dry out as easily or anything
although i will say these don't even dry
out once the like tops kind of our
coming off i still find that they're
very what they're really they're really
just great i love these highly recommend
them and i am going to be doing a
giveaway soon and i'm gonna be putting
one of these like one of those 60 packs
in there I mean not that it's like a big
value but I just love them I use them
all myself I use them in my kit I just
love these I have to hand soaps I go
through hand soap we wash our hands this
is the kroger mango nectar this one's
felt really nice it was just clear I
love the packaging of these and I told
you guys before that I wasn't gonna buy
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works ones and I was just
going to keep buying the kroger ones
like this uh they are
there I look in kroger and looking
around trying to find him nowhere to be
seen so frustrating and so I did cave
and I bought online I bought so much so
I think from bath and body works they
were doing a deal like 10 en soaps for
thirty dollars plus I got twenty percent
off so i think i got two of those i got
20 hand soaps for think 58 was shipping
with tax I thought that was really good
deal that's gonna last me probably the
whole year and it was like the perfect
time to buy soap because they still had
their summer soaps and they had their
fall soaps out so I felt like I had a
good mix of like year-round sense that i
would like to enjoy and it wasn't just
buying like one season and stocking up
and then like I'm going into fall but
all I have a summer soaps so I'm really
happy that I have those I feel really
happy in that decision although it's
like having a lot of backstock it was
nice like Oh last year all this year I
haven't had to really buy soap or
anything we can just go through the
cabinet pick one out and it's perfect
anyway I'm just letting you guys know
what update on that I probably should
have posted a picture on Instagram maybe
I'll do that eventually cuz I do love
them they're very fun and it was nice
ordering something from Bath and Body
Works but but also ordering something
knowing I was gonna use them and get use
out of them and enjoy them and that they
were useful that I spent like sixty
dollars essentially on like useful
things for my household instead of like
body sprays that I'm like oh this sucks
you know the other hand soap I used up
happens to you from bath and body works
because I do love their hand soaps this
one is the kitchen apple and fresh mint
this is a nice scent I don't think we
use this in the kitchen though think we
just used it in the bathroom I really
like Apple sense clean sense fruity sons
mostly that I don't like something too
sweet I got a couple of like sweet fall
sense because it is nice every now and
then to like have a nice scent like that
but that's not my normal I like like
autumn is one of my favorite scents from
them like Chris morning air apple
orchard like those types of scents are
the ones that I go for anyway that's
about ham so I was seriously so excited
when I got those hand soaps and you have
no idea like no one should be that
excited about hands out I have two
little mini Bath &amp;amp; Body Works shower
gels this one is the fresh Brazil citrus
I love the Sun i bought this when this
first came out I think like two summers
ago or something and I bought like one
each of these small versions I think
there were like three in the collection
anyway i just bought them because it was
like an impulse buy i just did it to do
it this scent smells so good in the
shower on the loofah like all sudsy i
loved it i wish i had a full size
actually that's how much I liked it
which I was not expecting I thought I
would just like go through this no big
deal whatever but I love this it was so
good the other one i have is one my mom
actually brought when she came to visit
she brought this and then she never took
it home and it had like a little bit
left so i just finished it off this is
japanese cherry blossom not my favorite
scent i know a lot of people like this
it is like a classic of theirs but it's
just too must like it's just not me it's
totally not me I don't like the way this
smells in the shower I think it changes
and I still don't like it when it
changes i have another toothpaste this
is the Colgate teeth whitening one it's
the optic white we get these I got a big
pack at costco same with the flocks we
usually go through at least one floss a
month this is the reach mint waxed floss
lots of razors up some of those razors
alike I don't even want to tell you old
so they just needed to go I think that's
how I am I'm just like get a razor put
it in and then like four months later I
just keep adding razors instead of like
putting them in there so that's why
there's so many I have an eye cream in
here that's all the way used up this is
from origins and this is the ginseng eye
cream I do really enjoy this I'm really
sorry if you can hear that i'm sure you
can because i can hear it like it's
another i think they're gone okay um i
do really enjoy this I this is just a
small sex I came in like a 500-point kit
it's prefer anyway I really like this
this was in my project ease it up but I
have since stopped that so I'm showing
you the empty in here the rest are
perfume and makeup only a couple more
left we'll just go with makeup I finish
up a lil rock behind the scenes I primer
I had this in my kit and it's all the
way gone I did recently purchase the
lorac pro 3 I had to go pick up some
things for set and then I
in there and I get forty percent off and
I just I did it I wanted it so i have a
new one of these in my kit now I do like
this I primer I think it works really
well I like it in the squeezy tube that
makes it easy another thing that I used
up in my kid this is the essence gel
eyeliner and it is all the way gone i
was using this like in school and then
also just finished it up in my kid I
love this eyeliner I think it works
really well it's so inexpensive and it's
a super creamy for forever super black
and pigmented this isn't one of those
ones that like pools like some eyeliners
are just like a thicker formula this is
not one of those I just really like this
it's easy to work with and I don't find
that it transfers once it sets I just
think it's so great for the price way
better than the Maybelline one which I
just bought I hate that one so I do like
this in the last two things i did finish
up the Daisy oh so fresh rollerball this
again was in my project geez it up and I
just wanted to show you guys that it's
finished so another perfume item to add
to my empties for the year and then I
did finish up just a little mini perfume
sprayer on its own this is the olin see
agha Paris I think it's just be belong
Chioggia really like this this is a very
floral scent but I feel like as I wear
it on my skin it turns sweeter and kind
of warms up I do enjoy this I would
think about potentially may be getting
like a rollerball in this at first and
seeing if I really really like it and
get like the full size but I was
surprised at how much I really like this
that's why I picked it out of all my
samples i picked this one out because i
really liked it okay those are all my
empties guys i hope you enjoyed this
video i'm going to be filming next like
a kit what's in my kit and what's in my
set back it'll be two parts so stay
tuned for that I know yours have been
wanting that but it's coming and I will
see you guys in my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
