Lauren we have an empties video today so
many items
yeah we're just going to get into it I
only vamp these playlist link down below
gonna check them out so first off we
have the simple micellar cleansing water
I'm going through these like crazy
because I got a ton of Costco I am
almost done with another one I don't
know why you so much of this but I do so
you will see these in the next couple of
empties I do really like it I just like
micellar waters in general I like
something really gentle and non greasy
to clean my eye makeup and my face
makeup off with so this is wonderful
next I have batiste I always have this
in my empties this is my favorite scent
the tropical one I do feel like this is
leaving a bit of a white cast lately
though even on myself so I might switch
it up and get some other scents to see
if that's a little bit different I know
that Kourtney came in and this one is
like the worst in my cat so I might try
to switch it up and see if I can get
something that doesn't have a white cast
or as bad of a white cast because that's
just like not the cutest even on my hair
I have a million wipes okay so a ton of
my favorite at the AL ones these are all
in the aloe vera I don't know why I went
through so many I don't know if I was
just watching like crazy and also for my
kit I don't even know man and then the
other ones here are from Bioderma
these are the ones that are basically
just filled with the micellar water that
they have and sell separately I did not
like these they are good quality wipes
they were large and they felt nice but
they were not saturated and that for me
definitely don't like him over my one
dollar wipe so I would not hurt
I would not purchase these so yeah I did
get through them though I have another
hair product here this is from bumble
and bumble and this is the full form
mousse I really like this this is my
third bottle of this it works really
well it adds a lot of texture it is a
little bit sticky almost in the hair but
the texture and volume that this gives
is really really nice and I do really
like it we moved on to something from
Big Lots that was like a dollar 50 so
we'll see how that goes I just was being
cheapen didn't want to reverse
this at the moment this is $30 which is
so expensive and even with my discount
it's still really expensive so yeah I
probably will repurchase this at some
point just not yet I have two mics
whispers cotton rounds here I guess
these at Costco and I do really like
them I just bought a new like nine pack
at Costco yesterday so I will repurchase
these I haven't purchased them I do
really like them I have a massive bottle
of brush cleaner here this is the NBS
brush cleaner I get this at Namie's but
I did repurchase the cinema secrets one
I didn't I feel like my brush cleaner I
just like to go back and forth between
them sometimes it's hard to break up
even like lip products and stuff like
stuff that's more waxy but I still do
really like this one it's really
affordable I think this is like 24 or so
dollars for the big one I have a hand
soap here from about the body works this
is the sunlight and apple-trees love the
Sun I love Apple cents
I love that it's turning into fall
although in California it is so freakin
hot I don't even know what's happened in
the last like week it's been blazing hot
like I feel like I'm back in Arizona
like what's going on anyway I can't wait
to burn some false candles and use some
more of my fall scented hand soaps hello
what is it pumpkin latte vanilla latte
what is the one lot last year I have two
of them right now in my backups I did
finish up a candle this is on top of the
candle that I had in my project use it
up so I used up two candles in this last
month this isn't a hot Guinea coconut
this smells really nice I wouldn't
repurchase it though I just like
mahogany teak wood better and if I want
a coconut scent like just get a coconut
scent this one is like an in-between and
although it's not bad it's just like I'm
not in the mood for both I just like
want one or the other but other than
that it was good I have to puff knees
here dude my husband just goes to these
like crazy like Samuel come on this is a
volumizing powder that you spray into
your hair I do really like
we have one more of these left and then
I have a big sexy hair one and then
after that I don't know I feel like we
just go through these so fast so maybe
the ones that you tap-in or with like
that isn't spray would go slower because
you don't have as much like crazy
control just like spraying it like a
madman madman madman anyway if you
really like these I will probably
repurchase them when we're done with
them it's just we go through two a month
even at the really good discount I can
get them at like okay we got to rethink
some priorities I did have one and make
up empty it's just my own hair it's just
my brow pencil from ELF and they love
these I go through these all the time I
love them you know that there are two
dollars in case you didn't know I have a
skin care product here from Kiehl's this
is the daily reviving concentrate I got
this from my mom she just like left it
here because there wasn't much left and
I finished it up I thought this was nice
it smelt really citrusy I've been
actually getting into oils lately
because I feel like my skin is more dry
than ever I don't know why
so oils have been a nice like every
other night type of thing and this one
was good I don't know if I'd repurchase
it but it was nice I have a floss here
this is the reach mint wax floss I get
them at the dollar store I did finish up
my last bath and Bodyworks Wallflower
and the one that I have in now is the
cranberry pear Bellini scent I have a
deodorant here this is the Dove clinical
protection with moisturizer and this is
the revive scent which I believe is like
pomegranate I do like this I like the
more prescription-strength or like
clinical protection ones I just am so
stinky and sweaty and nasty so I find
that I feel more comfortable especially
because I'm gonna be doing people's
makeup hello and I'm like carpets in
their face I definitely need like as
much protection as possible so I did
repurchase these and I continue to use
them we're almost done guys I'm kind of
just like speeding through this sorry
this one I feel like I have some new
things but a lot of it's like old you've
already seen like these things a million
times next is an eye cream this is from
embryo lycée and this is just like
their like I don't know normal eye cream
I really like this though we went
through it kind of fast meat on Sam but
I would definitely repurchase this I
mean
two different night creams at the moment
and don't like either of them as much as
I liked using this just everything about
it the way this feels it's just
moisturizing it doesn't leave Krusty's
in my eyes in the morning doesn't hurt
my eyes if it gets into them it also has
great packaging it's just easy to get
out and it's sanitary like I'm just in
love with it I have a body wash here
from Bath and Body Works this is the
wild Apple daffodil what is happening to
me guys what is happening daffodil it's
like I was trying to like pronounce it
as I said it I don't know daffodil wild
Apple daffodil I just like the sin of
this it was nice it's just old this is
so old though you can never get that and
if you see it at the like semi-annual
sale like don't get it sold
alright guys and last here is a body
scrub from malicious I love this this is
one of my favorite body scripts ever I
have purchased one of these in the past
this when I got through Hockley and it's
gone
oh it's all the way god this smells like
coconut this is a really nice coconut
scent the way that this feels on the
skin is so different than any other body
scrub I've ever used it's like this
whipped really nice moisturizing sugar
scrub so good it does leave a bit of an
oily residue on the skin which is
usually not my thing but something about
this one is really really nice and I
would definitely repurchase I think
these are great to give us like a luxury
gift to someone this is something that I
think most people wouldn't buy for
themselves but would really enjoy using
it's just good it's really good and that
is everything I really hope you enjoyed
this empties video I just wanted to run
through my trash with the elderly really
fast
that is everything thank you so so much
for watching and I will see you in my
next video
