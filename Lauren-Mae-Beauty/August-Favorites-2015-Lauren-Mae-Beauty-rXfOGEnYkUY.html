channel I am gonna be doing a August
favorites video I haven't done a
favorites video in a super long time I
honestly just wasn't using any new
products I just didn't have anything
special to show you and kind of just in
the last couple of weeks and in August
I've been loving some things it's not
even things that I've loved in like June
and July and I just carried them over
like they're all things that I've
recently fallen in love with or
rediscovered in my collection so I
wanted to show you them they're mostly
all beauty and then I have a couple
random Athey and oh let's not start this
video by getting out of breath but let's
get into my favorites for the month okay
so I have a shocker here the first item
is this chlorine or chlorine dry shampoo
now this is theirs this is one of the
green cap and also there's another one I
think it's like a gentle formula this
stuff is super good everyone at work
told me this stuff was amazing and not
that I didn't believe them but you know
how much I love my petite so I was kind
of intrigued to try this but also like
you know nothing can be batiste but this
stuff is freakin awesome I really like
this I kind of think I like it just the
tiniest bit more than batiste I'll
probably still buy booties cuz it is
cheaper at work we sell these for I
believe 18 or 19 dollars a piece but
then we recently had like a shipment
come in that had these in the dual pack
so it was two of them for 30 plus my
discount so I thought it was like the
perfect opportunity to try it out so I
went for it and I really liked it I do
feel like I'm going through it faster
than the petite like in uses but I do
really like it so you might see more of
these and my empties are in hauls
because it's really good stuff so if you
guys are wondering about it I would try
it you can also get it in like
miniatures sizes if you want me to try
it that way but just go for it if you
like direction of who you love this all
the rest of the stuff is makeup stuff so
yeah lots of stuff I have rediscovered
my mac fix+ and I absolutely love this
not only the smell because it smells so
amazing seriously the smell of this I
know they came
with other ones like the coconut and a
couple other scents which I'm sure smell
absolutely amazing as well but the
original Center this just smells so
refreshing
oh I should spray isn't the mist is so
fine you can like lock the cap it's just
so good so I totally recommend this I
actually rediscovered this because for
September I'm trying to use up my Evian
water bottle like spray bottle which you
know I have used it up actually right
out of compressed air before the actual
product was out of it which was annoying
oh that whole thing just frustrates me
but so I've kind of been like getting
used to using the water and then I
didn't have anymore and then I've been
using this and I just like the way it
makes the powder look on my face and I
find that throughout the day when I use
this although it's not meant to
necessarily like prolong your makeup
where I feel like it does keep my makeup
on longer so I've really been loving
this I'm like over halfway done and when
I finish it out buy a new one for sure
I finished up the foundations that I was
using so I've kind of had to rediscover
something else new to use and I have
rediscovered this foundation in my
collection now I was using this quite a
bit before I had already hit pan on it
just the tiniest bit before now I've
even made it bigger but this is the
covergirl and Olay simply ageless
foundation and sunscreen in the shade
210 this stuff with my Beauty Blender is
so nice and honestly I have not been
into cream foundation for a really long
time I just have been using it because
I've been at school and I just don't
usually like a cream foundation but
lately I've been absolutely loving it
like it makes me look flawless if I have
the right primer on which I'm working on
that situation it can stay all day on me
it just looks so good so this is a great
drugstore option if you
wanting something full coverage with the
Beautyblender it just blends out so
nicely too you can really get a sculpted
look and I've just been loving it
keeping with creams I have two other
like products this is a nude sticks
stick it's in the concealer and this is
shade number eight it is like a dark
brown color definitely not my shade for
concealer but I have been using this
contour and I'll just use it like in the
hollows of my cheeks on my temples and
then really that's it I might do a
little bit on the jaw line for the
tiniest bit of definition there and then
on top of that cream foundation I'll
blend it out with my Beauty Blender and
it just looks so fierce me and Sam went
on a date I felt super hot wearing this
I've really just been enjoying not every
day but like on the days I really want
to like beat this face I will use this
and I absolutely love it so I've just
been enjoying like cream contours like
that this is my first one that I've ever
had so I didn't really just have
anything else to try before but now I
have this and I really like it I think
it's just a good one I'm not saying this
is the only one it's just the one I have
in general cream contouring with this
stick specifically because I have it
that's not making any sense but anyway I
really like this product for how I've
been using it and now for two products
that I kind of just got so I probably
shouldn't even include these but I'm
going to anyway because it's my video
and I like these so these are from Stila
they are the CC con let me read the
actual name these are steel is color
correcting stick with SPF 20 I actually
have four shades of this I just went to
Nigel's with my school and I went a
little crazy and I got four different
shades I basically skipped every number
so I kind of feel like I can make any
one shade is what I was hoping I was
going to use these in class we're in TV
so we're doing makeup for TV and it's
supposed to basically like look good but
undetectable and these are really nice
I'll swatch them this is like the fair
one this is the fairest at it they have
and then I do get the darkest ones but
the next darkest one is number seven and
that's it there and again I
using these in a similar way like this
is all over the face this one is like
cream contouring I just really like
these they blend out really nice I'm
gonna bring them to Peru with me too
because you can just kind of dab it on
your face blend it out and they're just
really nice they have SPF in them I
don't know I've just really been
enjoying them I think they just blend
out like that blends out so nicely it
look like skin I feel like you can't
really see product and then with a
primer and everything they're just great
I actually got these at Nigel's instead
of my work because they were half off
there and I only get 30% off at my work
so I saved money on them and I've wanted
them I've been testing them out at work
for a little bit and then I sold it was
someone actually I was selling him to
someone and I was like I was like you're
making me want them and then now I have
four of them so you know that's the life
I live I don't know I just think they're
so nice I can't wait to do people's
makeup with these I just think it's
gonna be easy simple flawless but not
like cakey so yeah I would check them
out if you can swatch them or something
see if they'd work for your lifestyle
but yeah I've really really just have
been liking like this whole cream thing
I don't know I'm into it I really like
contouring because this is the
contouring kit this is Smashbox is
contouring palette this isn't a light
shade that Duke have a deeper shade of
these powders now specifically I've
really been liking this light powder and
I'll use that to set underneath my eyes
and just like I'm in the center of my
face or anywhere where I highlight it
and then I'll use my regular powder on
the rest of my face where it contoured
and I just find that it gives me that
just extra bit of like I don't know move
on what I did underneath my underneath
my powder so it's just emphasizing it a
little bit more than if I set my face
with just the same color powder
everywhere I've really been liking that
though I've been doing that like
everyday for a little bit now so I
probably should use the other colors in
here so I don't just like run out of one
shade but if I use anything up right now
that's success I guess if you leave
in this I think this is a great contour
palette it just has everything you need
it has the light shade which is what I
have been using but the bronzer and then
the contour they're all really nice they
are great quality powder I just think
they're great I'm into this too so it's
a favorites video I'm into it all okay
this has also been a favorite I've
absolutely been loving this Josie Maran
a water I shadow
coconut water eyeshadow the Josie Mann
coconut water I shadow I love this thing
it's so what nice it feels good to be so
like enthusiastic about products because
you know I contemplated making a video
I'm so watching this right now I
contemplated making a video like a
favorites of you for July and June but I
wouldn't have been as passionate you
know like I love this stuff that's it
there stop my heart just died so pretty
I have the shade on my lids right now I
just have been loving it and like one of
the first days I wore this I've got like
two or three compliments on my eyeshadow
color so obviously other people liked it
too it's so pretty and although this is
oh this is in the color Playa del pink
but although it says it's pink it's very
like a baby pink it's so pretty
I just can't seriously I can't totally
worth the investment I basically want
every single color I think this is my
last Beauty favorite so we're getting
there guys this is just a brush from
Sigma this is the large angled contour
f40 I got this in my mr. bunny kit or
mrs. bunny kit I don't know Sam got me
one for Christmas one year and this is
something I really didn't use before for
contouring I usually like like a duo
fiber kind of like fluffier brush that's
like tapered but I have just been really
liking the more precise placement I
don't go super dark on my contour but
you can really just well it's the wrong
way but you can really just get right in
there and then I'll just like blend kind
of up or in circular motions up and I've
really been liking the way that that
defines my contour it's not as big like
of an area that's contoured and I've
just been enjoying that look especially
with the cream underneath so this has
really come in handy and I'm glad that
I'm getting use out of it because I
really wasn't before
the only thing
I don't like is the ferrule is loose on
this and I had a couple brushes from
this set like immediately the ferrule is
loose and I know how to wash my brushes
so it's not user error on my part
because I have tons of brushes like
weight cheaper brushes that have not
like gotten loose like that so fast a
little annoying but overall I really
have been enjoying this brush and my
last two random favorites I have been
really loving The X Files lately I don't
know what possessed me to watch it in
the first place that's an X file all in
itself but I was I wanted to watch it I
saw it on Netflix all nine seasons are
on there and these seasons are like
20-something episodes it's not like Sons
of Anarchy or something like 13 or so
this one has like 25 episodes 22
episodes season oh I'm just like so into
it every single night at dinner if I
have any free time at work if I have any
free time like not while I'm on the
clock but have any like on my lunch at
work or at school when I have lunch like
I'm obsessed with the x-files I just
love it I would love to work on the XL
but if I have to pick a show to do
makeup on it begets Isles I'd totally
pick the x-files but anyway just
obsessed
you know I'm geeking out more and more
as I get older I don't know what it is
and then next my other favorite if you
guys know anything about me I hope that
you know that I love Drake I have
mentioned Drake in like one other video
but I'm still obsessed just as obsessed
as I was in February I loved his new
album well it's not new anymore but his
most recent album I am just in love with
it I wrap in my car all the time it's so
good it's not everyone's type of music
but if you like Drake or if you like rap
I would check out that album if you
haven't already if you haven't already I
don't know where you've been but it's so
good it's so freaking good okay I hope
you got to know um a little
more about me in this video I feel like
I was kind of relaxed or like a little
crazy so sorry but those are all my
favorites guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you like this video
