channel I'm gonna be doing a August
favorites video I haven't done a
favorites video in a super long time I
honestly just wasn't using any new
products I just didn't have anything
special to show you and kind of just in
the last couple of weeks and in August
I've been loving some things it's not
even things that I've loved in like june
and july and I just carried them over
like they're all things that I've
recently fallen in love with or
rediscovered in my collection so I
wanted to show you them they're mostly
all beauty and then I'll have a couple
random athey and oh let's not start this
video by getting out of breath but let's
get into my favorites for the month okay
so i have a shocker here the first item
is this chlorine or chlorine dry shampoo
now this is there's this is one of the
green cap and also there's another one I
think it's like a gentle formula this
stuff is super good everyone at work
told me this stuff was amazing and now
that I didn't believe them but you know
how much I love my petite so I was kind
of intrigued to try this but also like
you know nothing can be petits but this
stuff is freaking awesome I really like
this I kind of think I like it just the
tiniest bit more than Battiste i'll
probably still by Apaches cuz it is
cheaper at work we sell these for I
believe eighteen or nineteen dollars a
piece but then we recently had like a
shipment come in that had these in the
dual pack so it was two of them for 30
plus my discount so I thought it was
like the perfect opportunity to try it
out so I went for it and i really like
it I do feel like I'm going through it
faster than the petites like in uses but
I do really like it so you might see
more of these and my empties or in halls
because it's really good stuff so if you
guys are wondering about it i would try
it you can also get it in like
miniatures sizes if you wanted to try it
that way but just go for it if you like
dry shampoo you'll love this all the
rest of the stuff is makeup stuff so
yeah lots of stuff I have rediscovered
my mac fix+ and I absolutely love this
not only the smell because it smells so
amazing seriously the smell of this I
know that
about with other ones like the coconut
and a couple other scents which I'm sure
smell absolutely amazing as well but the
original Center this just smells so
refreshing oh I should spray it the mist
is so fine you can like lock the cab
it's just so good so I totally recommend
this I actually rediscovered this
because for September I'm trying to use
up my Evian water bottle unlike spray
bottle which you know i have used it up
actually write out of compressed air
before the actual product was out of it
which was annoying oh that whole thing
just frustrates me but so I've kind of
been like getting used to using the
water and then I didn't have any more
and then I've been using this and I just
like the way it makes the powder look on
my face and I find that throughout the
day when I use this although it's not
meant to necessarily like prolong your
makeup where I feel like it does keep my
makeup on longer so I've really been
loving this I'm like over halfway done
and when I finish it out buy a new one
for sure I finished up the foundations
that i was using so I've kind of had to
rediscover something else new to use and
I have rediscovered this foundation in
my collection now I was using this quite
a bit before I had already hit pan on it
just the tiniest bit before now I've
even made it bigger but this is the
covergirl and Olay simply ageless
foundation and sunscreen in the shade to
10 this stuff with my Beauty Blender is
so nice and honestly I have not been
into cream foundation for a really long
time I just had been using it cuz I've
been at school and I just don't usually
like a crane foundation but lately I've
been absolutely loving it like it makes
me look flawless if I have the right
primer on which I'm working on that
situation it can stay all day on me it
just looks so good so this is a great
drugstore option if you are wanting
something full coverage with the Beauty
Blender it just blends out so nicely to
you can really get a sculpted look and
I've just been loving it keeping with
creams I have two other like products
this is a nude sticks stick it's in the
concealer and this is shade number 8 it
is like a dark brown color definitely
not my shade for concealer but i have
been using this contour and i'll just
use it like in the hollows of my cheeks
on my temples and then
really that's it i might do a little bit
on the jaw line for the tiniest bit of
definition there and then on top of that
crane foundation i'll blend it out with
my Beauty Blender and it just looks so
fierce me and salmon on a date I felt
super hot wearing this I've really just
been enjoying not every day but like on
the days I really want to like beat this
face I will use this and I absolutely
love it so I've just been enjoying like
cream contours like that this is my
first one that I've ever had so I didn't
really just have anything else to try
before but now I have this and I really
like it I think it's just a good one I'm
not saying this is the only one it's
just the one I have in general cream
contouring with this stick specifically
because I have it that's not making any
sense but anyway I really like this
product for how I've been using it and
now for two products that I kinda just
got so I probably shouldn't even include
these but I'm going to anyway because
it's my video and I like these so these
are from stila they are the CC con let
me read the actual name these are steel
is color correcting stick with SPF 20 I
actually have four shades of this I just
went to Nigel's with my school and I
went a little crazy and I got four
different shades I basically skipped
every number so I kind of feel like I
can make anyone's shade is what I was
hoping I was going to use these in class
we're in TV so we're doing makeup for TV
and it's supposed to basically like look
good but undetectable and these are
really nice I'll swatch them this is
like the fair one this is the Faris it
they have and then I do get the darkest
ones but the next darkest one is number
seven and that's it there and again I've
just been using these in a similar way
like this is all over the face this one
is like cream contouring I just really
like these they blend out really nice
I'm gonna bring them to Peru with me too
because you can just kind of dab it on
your face blend it out and they're just
really nice they have SPF in them I
don't know I've just really been
enjoying that I think they just blend
out like that blend out so nicely it
looked like skin I feel like you can't
really see product and
and with a primer and everything they're
just great actually got these at Nigel's
instead of my work because they were
half off there and I only get 30 percent
off at my work so I saved money on them
and I've wanted them i've been testing
him out at work for a little bit and i
sold it was someone actually i was
selling them to someone and I was like I
was like you're making me want them and
then now I have four of them so you know
that's the life I live I don't know I
just think they're so nice I can't wait
to do people's makeup with these I just
think it's gonna be easy simple flawless
but not like cakey so yeah I would check
them out if you can swatch them or
something see if they'd work for your
lifestyle but yeah I really really just
have been liking like this whole cream
thing I don't know I'm into it I really
like contouring because this is a
contouring kit this is Smashbox is
contouring palette this isn't a light
shade they do have a deeper shade of
these powders now specifically I've
really been liking this light powder and
i'll use that to set underneath my eyes
and just like um in the center of my
face or anywhere where i highlighted and
then i'll use my regular powder on the
rest of my face where a contoured and I
just find that it gives me that just
extra bit of like I don't know on what I
did underneath my underneath my powder
so it's just emphasizing it a little bit
more than if i set my face with just the
same color powder everywhere i've really
been liking that though i've been doing
that like everyday for a little bit now
so i probably should use the other
colors in here so I don't just like run
out of one shade but if I use anything
up right now that's success i guess i've
really been liking this i think this is
a great contour palette I just has
everything you need it has the light
shade which is what i have been using
but the bronzer and then the contour
they're all really nice they are great
quality powder I just think they're
great I'm into this too so it's a
favorites video I'm into it all okay
this has also been a favorite I've
absolutely been loving this josie maran
a water I shadow coconut water eyeshadow
the Josie man coconut water eyeshadow I
love this thing it's so what nice it
feels good to be so like enthusiastic
about products because you know I
contemplated making a video
watching this right now I contemplated
making a video like a favorite city for
july and june but i wouldn't have been
as passionate you know like i love this
stuff that's it there stop my heart just
died so pretty i have the shade on my
lids right now i just have been loving
it and like one of the first days i wore
this I'm not like two or three
compliments on my eyeshadow color so
obviously other people like it too it's
so pretty and although this is 0 this is
in the color playa del pink but although
it says it's pink it's very like a baby
pink it's so pretty I just can't
seriously I can't totally worth the
investment I basically want every single
color I think this is my last beauty
favorites so we're getting there guys
this is just a brush from Sigma this is
the large angled contour f40 I got this
in my mr. bunny kit or mrs. bunny kit I
don't know Sam got me one for Christmas
one year and this is something I really
didn't use before for contouring i
usually like like a duo fiber kind of
like fluffier brush that's like tapered
but i have just been really liking the
more precise placement I don't go super
dark on my contour but you can really
just well it's the wrong way you can
really just get right in there and then
I'll just like blend kind of up or in
circular motions up and I've really been
liking the way that that defines my
contour it's not as big like of an area
that's contoured and I've just been
enjoying that look especially with the
cream underneath so this has really come
in handy and I'm glad that I'm getting
you said of it because it really wasn't
before the only thing that I don't like
is the ferrule is loose on this and I
had a couple brushes from this set like
immediately the ferrule is loose and I
know how to wash my brushes so it's not
user error on my part because I have
tons of brushes like wait cheaper
brushes that have not like gotten loose
like that so fast a little annoying but
overall I really have been enjoying this
brush and my last two random favourites
I have been really loving the x-files
lately I don't know what possessed me to
watch it in the first place that's an
x-file all in itself but I was I wanted
I thought on netflix all nine seasons
are on there and these seasons are like
20-something episodes it's not like sons
of anarchy or something or it's on like
13 or so this one has like twenty five
episodes 22 episodes season oh I'm just
like so into it every single night at
dinner if I have any free time at work
if I have any free time like not while
I'm on the clock but have any like on my
lunch at work or at school when I have
lunch like I'm obsessed with the x-files
I just love it I would love to work on
the XL look if I have to pick a show to
do makeup on it begets files I totally
pick the Exiles but anyway just obsessed
you know I'm geeking out more and more
as i get older i don't know what it is
and then next my other favorite if you
guys know anything about me i hope that
you know that i love Drake I have
mentioned Drake in like one other video
but I'm still obsessed just as obsessed
as i was in February I love his new
album well it's not new anymore but his
most recent album I am just in love with
it I rap in my car all the time it's so
good it's not everyone's type of music
but if you like drag or if you like rap
I would check out that album if you
haven't already if you haven't already I
don't know where you've been but it's so
good so freaking good okay I hope you
got to know a little bit more about me

relaxed or like a little crazy so sorry
