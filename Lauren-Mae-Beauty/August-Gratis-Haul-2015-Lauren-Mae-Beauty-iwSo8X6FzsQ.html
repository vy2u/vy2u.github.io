it's lauren as i normally do the same
day it's on my empties i also film my
gratis hall for the month so i'm going
to explain it as you guys may know i do
work at a beauty store so in that
environment you get a lot of free
products from different brands so that
you can try out the products and then
let customers know from firsthand
experience how the product works whether
you like it hopefully you like it this
video is just meant for me to be really
transparent and also just let you know
how I got these products let me show you
what's coming into my collection and I
didn't get these from YouTube or
anything it's just because of where I
work and let's get into it if you guys
want to see a review on any of these
parts again that's always the case just
let me know down below or if you want
any extra information and let's get into
it I didn't really address my like dark
lip in the last video but this is kat
von d's liquid lipstick in the color
damned um i like it it's really dark it
looks kind of black in the video monitor
but it's not it's definitely just
slightly not black it's like a really
dark purple a red I know it's not fall
but I just wanted to go for it first
things first I got this room Kate
Somerville she actually came not Kate
herself but we got trained by Kate
Somerville yesterday so I got the
reddest fear micro peel retinol glycolic
treatment now this is a product you're
going to put on your face after you
clean your whole face on dry skin you're
going to put this treatment on just a
thin layer and then you're gonna go to
bed um this has retinol in it so it's
going to help with cell turnover help
with wrinkles and lines I'm a little
scared of this product I'm not gonna lie
because I don't know retinol just kind
of scares me you're supposed to use it
every other night I have pretty
sensitive skin so I'm gonna try to maybe
use it once a week once I decide to use
it but for now it's going to send my
drawer until I'm brave enough to use it
I kind of want to do a little bit more
research just on retinols like she
explained how to use this product
specifically and she did mention that
this retinol isn't going to dry the skin
out because it's like capsulated with
like hyaluronic acid
and all these other things but I don't
know because I've never used him before
it's dull office it still kind of
scares me so anyway I like making it
sound like a horror story it's not
people use these all the time that's
just like my personal thing we had the
bumble humble guy our bumble MMO guys
like super cute but um he came in and he
gave us a couple little sample sizes of
the new thickening line that they're
coming out with so these are the BB full
potential this is the hair preserving
booster spray this is the hair Bruce
hair preserving shampoo and this is the
conditioner that goes with it now if i'm
not mistaken i wasn't like trained on
the line yet because they're going to be
coming in super soon so hopefully we get
more gratis please from bumble and
bumble that's like amazing but these are
supposed to not only give you thickening
in the moment but I believe that also
supposed to prolong like hair like keep
your hair promote hair growth and
promote thicker hair so you don't have
anything in there lying quite like that
right now so I think it's cool if it
works I don't know yet but I'm excited
to try it out that's always my goal is
thicker hair I don't have a lot of hair
it may seem like it in my videos but
trust me like it's all illusion Home
Edition and then as he was leaving we
have stuff that people like return and
then he's like he let me go through and
pick something that we would still get
credit for the return but this was in
there it works and it's like I felt
sanitary because it's like in the
container and then dispenses out there's
no real way to get in but this is the BB
thickening sculpting foam full form
mousse and I wanted to try this out I am
trying to use one up so I'm not going to
use this until I finish up what i'm
trying to use which is huge but i wanted
to give this a try i wanted to give it a
try for a while so I thought why not see
if I like it I just have a couple little
sample packets in a minute throw and
you're usually I don't include these but
i'm going to this is a NUMA product now
I
did hall in my last gratis video quite a
bit of Numa because our new brand we
started carrying their really
sustainable they're like organic and
natural really awesome but this product
specifically is really unique to their
line in general this is the renew scalp
therapy exfoliator so it is an
exfoliator for the scalp I don't know
why there's not more brands that have
this I don't know if I'm just don't I'm
just unaware but I've never really heard
of a scalp exfoliator like this so you
would put this in you'd already have
your hair shampooed you have your
shampoos still in your hair and then
you're going to use this in the hair on
the scalp and scrub your scalp and give
it like a nice scrubbing exfoliation I
use a lot of dry shampoo and I can get a
lot of buildup because of that so I
thought this would be a great way to not
only exfoliate but kind of get rid of
some of that extra I don't know build-up
and since we had samples of it I took
one and if I like it I'll probably
purchase this full size because I just
think like once a week it'd be a really
good way to use it and then just to let
you know the reason you use it with the
shampoo is just so that way you have a
way to move it around and you can use
less product these if you went in just
with like what hair with no real like I
don't know what I want to call matrix or
something to move this product and you
just have to use more and you don't
wanna waste it the other little packets
I have are from pureology these are
their cleansing conditioners that came
out with I think three different ones
but this is the hydrate and this is the
strength cure I'm using the strength
cure line right now in my hair and I
don't know I just kind of wanted to try
out the cleansing conditioner see if I
like it I don't feel like I'm the best
candidate for a cleansing conditioner
because they do have thin fine hair but
we'll see I'm gonna try now you know I
also since their new products I kind of
want to be able to like give my opinion
on them the lady from Jane Eyre iredale
I think it's how you say it came in
today or today she came in this month
and we were working on some stuff I
cover a lot of bruises just in the area
I work that is a normal thing it's not
because people are being beat it's
because of like
medic procedures so I use a lot of like
Jane Iredale products to cover them and
she was like really happy so she gave me
a couple things this is one of their I
shears in the color champagne silk I'm
going to swatch it for you it has like a
little doe foot applicator but you can
also squeeze it out the tube I love
stuff in this format because you can
still squeeze or you can use this and
it's not like getting on your fingers
it's like the best of both worlds that's
it they're on my hand just a really
basic color and then that's it like
sheared out so I'm excited to try this
product out on the eyes you can also use
this potentially on the face anywhere
you want to use it so I think it's just
a cute little guy and this is full size
so it's meant to be used on the eyes
that's why it's such a small size but i
think you know trying to multi purpose
it would be the best thing because then
you have one product that does it all
and then she also just gave me this
little hand lotion it's called the hand
drink SPF 15 i love that it has SPF in
it because when you're driving just in
general your hands are exposed to the
sun a lot and that's why a lot of people
when they get older have a lot of age
spots on their hands because of driving
because of the Sun so if you can use an
SPF hand cream because it's just going
to help keep your skin one soft and
smooth but also long-term effects with
anti-aging the SPF is really going to
help with sun damage this one's really
nice you can't really feel like a greasy
residue it's a great daytime hand cream
to keep in your bag so if you have one
around you to check out I would this is
really nice hand cream I'll just keep on
with like makeup items nude sticks when
they came they left like a big huge box
full of a ton of like goodies for us and
then we could kind of like go through
them when we wanted to and pick new
stuff so I picked two more things from
the basket because I'm working on a lot
of the stuff already and i am using it
so i really just wanted to try out some
new stuff this right here is the mascara
this is the lash lengthening mascara
they did mention that this is like bio
peptides or something in it to help with
lengthening your lashes but it also its
unique feature i guess i won't open it
because i haven't opened it yet but the
unique feature about this is that
it is like a soft mascara so it doesn't
dry crispy it dries like to a flexible
hold so it's a thing that you could
touch up throughout the day like if
you're going out at night you could
retouch up with this and it wouldn't
like flake necessarily that's supposedly
the claims on it I have not used it but
I thought it was interesting and wanted
to try it I believe it's just like a
natural bristle brush it's not plastic
and then I also picked up one of their
concealer pencils this is in the shade
aight i wanted to use it as a contour
like a cream contour I don't really have
anything that really works that way
right now so i thought i would pick up
number 8 i did get the highlighting and
contouring like stick duo but it's too
light the light shade is perfect but the
medium shade is like not dark enough to
contour wife and if i want the other way
than the dark one would work but then
the light like the lighter one wouldn't
highlight enough so yeah i'm excited to
try this out dermalogica came and
trained us on not their whole line
because it's a huge line but just the
ultra calming part of the line and as
our gratis we got the pre cleanse this
is just the travel size this is like a
makeup remover pre cleanse exactly what
it says you take this you put it on your
hands you put on your face dry and then
you work it into your skin getting the
makeup off then you slowly add water and
emulsified product and it will just like
melt your makeup off I have used this
before I'm just not into oil cleansers a
ton so I think that's the reason it's
not my favorite but I'm just going to
keep it close for now and see if I ever
want to bust into it but if you like
those it's a good one I just personally
I'm not really into them I have some
more gratis from naturopath say this is
the c plus C vitamin souffle mask now we
do spiffs on them a lot and I'm excited
to try this out this mask compared to
the line is not that expensive it's
forty dollars this line is quite pricey
like for just the most like basic cream
it's like 80 and then it goes up to like
to something like an eye cream of theirs
to something like they have like a Botox
thing that's like seven hundred and
something so I think 40s
pretty good I'm excited to try this this
one has the vitamin C so it's helping
with like antioxidant it's helping
brighten the skin um make you look more
luminous that type of thing so I'm
excited to use this maybe once a week
we'll see I do want to use this so I
picked it out I had like a certain
amount of money that I could like to
choose any product and I chose this last
item this is the or lon serum firming
serum for the neckline for the neck and
decollete they came in trained us as
well or lon it's a French brand and its
really high-end skin care as well they
have something called royal jelly I
believe is what they call it and it is
quite expensive i think it's like six
hundred and something dollars anyway
this product is meant to be used on like
the decollete and neck and you're like
use upward swipes and it's gonna just
help firm that area so I since I am like
plus-sized I do have like some you know
me going on I mean neck this is like so
tonight but um I don't know I'm gonna
keep this and I'm not going to use it
quite yet but I am excited to
potentially try this product out and not
only give it to my mom or something so
those are all the items that are new to
my collection from work I'm excited to
try some of them others i'm probably
gonna pass along but nonetheless i
wanted to show you guys i hope you
enjoyed this video let me know if any of
these interest you or if you've tried
any of on what you think on them and i
will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
