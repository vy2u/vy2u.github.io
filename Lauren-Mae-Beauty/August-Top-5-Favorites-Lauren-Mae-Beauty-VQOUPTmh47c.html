Lauren I totally forgot to mention in my
last video but yes I did dye my hair
pink again I actually did this by myself
I was just like home alone and just
needed to like do something so i got the
dye out and just dyed my hair i used
actual die not like the shampoo that i
had mentioned in one of my videos i will
actually leave a link down though to
that shampoo I knew if someone had asked
in a comment so if you're wondering what
that is I'll leave it down below can't
think of the name right now anyway this
video is going to be my August top 5
favorites I am a little bit behind but I
know these are some of my favorite
videos to film just because it's fun to
talk about things you've been enjoying
it's fun to look back throughout the
month and just think of the things that
we're really fun to you maybe you forgot
them through all the crap that went on
or whatever but you really it'd just be
like oh that was awesome oh yeah that
was awesome too so let's just get into
some of my favorites the first favorite
i have here is a hand soap um we all
know my love for hand soap so
specifically bath and body works but i
really liked the San soap I had to
mention it this is the marshmallow
pumpkin latte I am NOT a sweet scent
kind of girl I don't necessarily like
I'm like I can do them a little bit but
this one smells really nice I love the
way it smells as soon as I changed it
because we've already gone through like
a Apple sent as soon as I changed its
and was like but his hands up to my face
was like smell I was like I know it
smells so good so I'm really enjoying
this I'm not quite halfway on it yet but
part of me is like tempted to get just a
couple of them just to have around after
the holiday and after like you know
September sons go away and Christmas
son's come in but I've just really been
enjoying this so if you stop by bath and
body works just give it a smell but I
just thought it was interesting that i
actually have been really enjoying this
and really liking it since this is
totally not my scent like profile at all
another thing i've been loving this is
the modern renaissance palette by
anastacio i got this a while ago
actually i feel like it's been a couple
months since i've had it but I just
haven't mentioned it in a video besides
the haul video just because it was in my
kit for a second and then
I really just I don't know I wasn't
playing around with it like probably the
first couple weeks I got it and as much
as I like knew I'd love it I didn't want
to just mention it to mention it so I'm
finally mentioning it because I feel
like I've given the colors quite a bit
of use I mean I think I've used every
single color in this palette you can
tell that there's some dents going on
you can tell by looking at it that you
know I feel like it's gotten some good
love so I've really been enjoying this
you guys really liked my Instagram post
with me wearing like that red eye and I
will be doing like a get ready with me
or tutorial or something on it I'm just
you know give me a second I was thinking
about actually doing like four looks one
pallet or something like that let me
know if you'd like that just because I
just feel like I can get so many
different looks with this and I've
really been just enjoying that so
obviously read warm tones are super
popular right now this one the violet
boss palette the Buddha beauty is a high
say that one else is very similar I
think like in lots coming out like a
spice palette so there's a lot of
different options this is just the one I
happen to pick up because I do like
honest Ostia and I just liked it but
it's permanent so you don't have to rush
out and get it I just have really been
enjoying it the one thing about this
though I will say that's like a downside
to me is that it's very powdery it's
like I feel like I'd see a little bit
worse than lorac sophal rock shadow
formulas like piss you off when you put
your brush in them I feel like you won't
like that about this I was a little bit
surprised because I don't feel like the
other Anasazi of Shadows that I have
like pick up as much powder as these
ones do but personally that's not like a
huge issue to me I love lorac formula
and shadows so I just make sure I tap my
brush off a lot and I try not to be like
just too harsh but I do find like more
stiff brushes or natural hair brushes
they're definitely gonna like get into
that product and like move it around so
anyway I really like this this is
definitely a favorite of mine and I
think that it's like it's just a good
staple palette for me obviously I like
warm and pink tones I have a couple
things that I haven't had for a really
long time but that I definitely have
been enjoying since i've had them so i
want to include them this is the butter
bronzer i was sent this in a friend mail
i filmed that video a little bit before
this but i don't know if it's gonna go
up until after this i think this group
of videos is going to go up before so um
you guys don't know i got this yet in a
friend hall but that video will be
coming this was sent to me by autumn she
has a channel here autumn more i will
leave her channel link down below but i
just have really been enjoying it this
is not a matte bronzer although the
shimmer in it is so fine that it's
really just like a light sheen so it
works in a very similar way as like I
matte bronzer would I just like the
color of this it's just nice that it's
not too over-the-top it doesn't add too
much and it just kind of brings back
some color and life to my face when I
after you know putting powder foundation
all these other things on it just kind
of brings a life back I mentioned in
that video it's so weird because this is
still gonna go first but I mentioned in
that video that the smell of this was
like I like the smell but then there's
like this part of me that just it's like
kind of fake coconut and kind of
chemical II I still kind of feel that
way but not as strongly like I think I
maybe I'm just getting used to it so
maybe my expectation and like hopes were
up here and I it just didn't hit that so
that's why it's a little disappointing
to me but it still smells good I see my
other whoa to break it I see what other
people like it the smell but it's
definitely a favorite i think if you
have really fair or you have light skin
it's really nice this one is in the
light bronzer so I think there is a
darker one if i'm not mistaken but it
this definitely won't show up on someone
probably was like medium or darker skin
like just don't waste your money there's
no reason it just won't show up and if
it does it might look a little even just
a she so it's definitely something that
caters to lighter skin and the other
thing that I kind of just recently
bought but I'm just like in love with
that this is a coconut water hydrating
face miss this is from the brand pearl
lessons I got this at TJ maxx i was
going in there to find some shoes
because i've talked about this before
but I wear the same shoes every single
day all the time and it's about times I
get some new ones I went in there for
shoes didn't find any so of course i
bought Battiste and this one thing i
really like about this one it just looks
expensive it kind of looks like urban
outfitters or something like that I just
liked the way it looked I'm not going to
lie and I like that it's in a glass
bottle I think that's just so nice and
again feels more luxe and luxury
and it's just nice this smells really
good when you spray it on it has a
really nice fine mr. I feel like for
especially like a TJ maxx product and I
wanted to get this to also use on set so
I put this on my set bag it just has
like a nice scent a light coconut it's
hydrating the mist is great just
everything about it was really nice and
it was 799 so I feel really good about
having this at my station something that
I'm like excited to use and even one of
people i do makeup on like sat and it's
like you what's that sprayed on my face
like immediately I just I really like
this i thought that price is really good
I think it's originally only ten dollars
anyway so it's not like you're saving a
ton of money like two dollars I really
like it and I want to reuse this bottle
once this is gone and put like my Koda
Lee one in it cuz my sprayer on that is
stopped working so um anyway I thought I
just talked about this briefly kind of
briefly and then my last favorite for
the month are just TV shows I probably
shouldn't have a ton of TV shows because
I should be reading but I do so we watch
stranger things I believe in august
maybe it was the end of july but
stranger things on Netflix it's a super
great show if you haven't gotten to it
yet it's really great I definitely
suggest it if you haven't seen this
super fruit like version of it I don't
want if you haven't seen the show don't
watch it because it'll spoil it but if
you have seen the show and you haven't
seen that video I will leave it linked
down below it's hilarious it's so funny
to me I really enjoyed that video from
them I hope they do more things like it
but what other shows have you watched
we've watched like mr. robot in the past
which is pretty good i really enjoyed
that show as well and right now i'm
watching Game of Thrones I don't know
why but Sam keeps like falling asleep
it's probably because he's working a lot
but I just had been loving Game of
Thrones I want to watch it all the time
but he's not that he's not into it's
just you've tired in there longer
episodes really been enjoying Game of
Thrones I think it's so funny because
Rita is watching Game of Thrones right
now and it's not like Game of Thrones
like this new show like everyone's
already seen it everyone already knows
what happens so I think it's kind of
interesting and fun that someone else is
like into it and watching it and it's
new to them at the same time as myself
because again everyone's already seen it
so it's like old news those are my
favorites for the month I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you guys in my
next video I'm gonna film one more video
today it's getting
you like kind of like just a talking
video honestly there's just some things
I want to talk about but anyway um
that's for a different video I'll see
you guys hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
