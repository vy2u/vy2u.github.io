Lauren this is going to be another
beauty brand spotlight I received some
products from octave Li from the brand
Dollface and I'd never heard of this
brand the products looked really really
pretty so I put in for a few different
things and got accepted for a couple and
I've been testing them out and I want to
tell you guys how I feel about them just
let you know the products that I was
said this is the Dollface clarifying
balancing tonic this is a toner so you
would use this after washing your face
but before moisturizing or using a serum
the packaging is super cute I told you
it would be cute and then the other
product that I received was a sponge
this is the pretty puff natural cognac
konjac I don't know how to say that so
anyway it's like an natural sponge and
mine is wet right now so yeah before I
get into my thoughts on the products I
want to tell you guys just a little bit
about the brand this is a cruelty free
brand I believe they're only sold online
their website and links to these
products will be listed down below like
always the entire idea behind this brand
is basically retro Hollywood trying to
hearken back to the old glamorous days
of beauty products on their website they
stressed that they want their experience
with their products to be glamorous in
the Beauty aspect and not really about
medicine and the problems with skin so I
feel like if you're looking for
something that's super medicinal if
you're looking for something that like
heels or a brand that's really using the
scientific and the biological and like I
don't know you know those type of brands
this is not for you this is meant to
look pretty it's meant to make you feel
pretty that's its entire thing so I
mentioned their cruelty-free they also
use cleaner formula so they're emitting
products that are known to cause
problems and going for more natural
products they also are using Fairtrade
products whenever possible they're made
in the US and they use recycled products
and their packaging so that's really all
I know about this brand from looking at
the website and everything I did mention
that I put in for other products they
have two products that I was really
wanting to try one is like a cold cream
and they also have a little black mask
so they do have other products and I
feel like more substantial products than
the ones I was sent I'm saying all that
because I feel like these are not
exactly the best products to represent
this entire brand so take my review of
this with a grain of salt I really want
try some of their more expensive stuff
and I feel like that's a better
reflection of what they put into their
product than these products this brand
is more high-end so the products aren't
in drugstore prices by any means let's
just talk about the toner first again
packaging is super cute I think that
that part of their mission is definitely
fulfilled even this bottle it's simple
the coloring though the products pink
the packaging is gold like I really like
it I think it's great I've been using
this product for a little bit and I
think this is okay this is supposed to
be a balancing toner so it's not
supposed to be overly like drying or
clarifying and not overly hydrating it's
just supposed to make your skin look
brighter it has like some fruit enzymes
and things in it to help with you know
giving you brighter skin I didn't notice
any brighter skin using this the smell
of this is really nice and it almost
makes me wish that it was in a spray
because I feel like it'd be super
refreshing but this packaging still
works that's just like a preference
thing overall it's okay I am used to
using more of a clarifying toner soar
something that maybe has a little bit
sting or just feels like it's doing
something this just doesn't feel like
anything on my skin so for me it just i
want the like placebo effect of it doing
something like i want to feel like
something's happening and you're not
gonna get that from this toner and then
the thing that's kind of killing it for
me is that when i put this on my face it
smells good immediately but as it sits
on my face it turns into this sulfur
scent it smells like the Mario Badescu
like acne treatment if you've ever used
that as that dries like it has like this
sulfur type of scent and that's what
this turns on my skin and it's light
enough that I definitely feel like I can
use the rest of this but it's something
that would definitely deter me from
buying it because this is $24 and I just
feel like that's kind of pricey so
overall for me I don't feel like the
price is worth this product I don't know
maybe I'll change my mind as I use more
of this and like grow to love it but
from one of you so far I just don't
think it's worth the price I don't think
it's a bad product but I just don't
think that it's worth $24 and I really
hate that smell that could just be my
skin chemistry mixing with this product
so it might not be
that way for everyone but it's just
that's not pleasant you know so yeah
this isn't my favorite onto the sponge
this is something I actually really
really like I've wanted to try one of
these sponges for the longest time it
came in this packaging so again really
cute I really liked the way it looked
and this actually came it was kind of
wet inside the packaging which kind of
freaked me out
I think it's the fact that there's like
rows I don't know what rows something in
here so that was kind of interesting
this is like such an interesting texture
when it came and almost had this like
sterile scent to it I don't know if that
was supposed to be a rose scent or what
that was it didn't bother me if anything
I was happy it smelt that way instead of
something else but that was just
something I thought I would note this
feels so great on the skin I love that
because it's squishy and malleable I can
really get into areas that have dry
patches and really need exfoliation so
for me that's like right around my nose
area I just I have a really dry nose
area and I feel like my crevices in my
nose are really deep so this can
actually get in there it's gentle enough
that I don't feel like I'm stripping my
skin and really you know making it raw
but it also is able to actually do
something and I can use this every day
just a little note I love a little
string on it so I can keep it in the
shower that's where I've been keeping it
if this doesn't stay wet it does dry out
and get hard but you can easily put this
back underwater and the sponge absorbs
the water again and in a few minutes its
back to its normal state this is just
really awesome I think it's I really
like this this is something that I don't
think you need but this is something
that's going to replace washcloths for
me I usually use a washcloth to help
exfoliate my skin and I feel like this
does it it's but it's a little bit more
gentle and I just prefer this so I think
this is really awesome
this retails for $14 on the website I
feel like that's a little steep I don't
know how long these usually lasts if it
lasts like six months it's not that bad
since this is my first one I don't know
how different these types of sponges are
but overall I'd highly suggest a sponge
like this I think these are really nice
and I really have been enjoying the way
it feels on my skin so I really do like
this those are my experiences with some
of the doll face products that I was
signed
I really wish I could try one of their
hydrating creams were a face mask or
something just a little bit more than
that toner just to get a better
well-rounded idea of what their brand
offers so overall I feel like I'm kind
of just like I think it's an okay brand
I don't think they have anything bad but
I really would like to know if some of
their higher-end skincare is worth it
sorry do not leave this on like a yes or
a no type of thing it's kind of like I'm
in the middle but have like one really
good thing in one just like okay thing /
smelly thing on me that's everything I'm
gonna end this review here I hope you
guys enjoyed let me know if you've tried
anything from them down below I would
love to hear someone's experiences with
those higher-end products
that's everything guys I hope you're
having a wonderful day and I will see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
