learn thanks so much for watching I
don't have a lip product on today
because we were gonna be doing a first
impression slash weird tests of the new
and cosmetics lip lip clowns
where are these fall and the cosmetics
is going through a relaunch they will be
officially relaunching their cosmetics
on the 17th of April so coming up really
soon I don't know when this video will
get posted so I will leave a link to the
website down below if you are interested
in these once we do the review I was
lucky enough to get my hands on these
early she did like a pre-launch and I
was on the reddit group beauty guru
chatter and I saw something about it
there and then from there I just
immediately went and bought them I don't
know why you guys know I'm not a liquid
lipstick girl but I just I was really
intrigued I was really excited that M
Cosmetics is like doing a whole separate
thing I don't think that their first
launch of the products is very good I
hate to be like I don't I'm not trying
to be mean or anything I just I don't
know I just expected more and this so
far is definitely giving it to me I have
tried these each once on my lips but
just in general everything about this
concept wise packaging and how it's
displayed just everything that I've seen
so far I am just like excited for
Michelle Phan and just for M cosmetics
this is going to be a part of my beauty
brand spotlight series so if you want to
check out other brands that are less
known or just don't get a lot of hype
here on YouTube I will leave that
playlist linked down below
I know people know about Michelle Phan
she's the one who started them cosmetics
but I feel like this new launch I
haven't heard anything about this like I
haven't heard anything so I thought it'd
be cool to let you guys know what they
are like how I like them show you the
swatches of the two colors that I got
but first let's talk a little bit about
the brand it's kind of hard I don't know
much about the brand because the website
doesn't have anything you can't even
like look at the liquid lipsticks
anymore I know they did sell out in a
day I was not expecting there to be that
much hype around these products because
like I said I hadn't heard anything but
I'm really glad that I was able to get
my hands on some of the products so it
will tell you what I do know about these
products and just kind of like showing
you packaging and all that these are $16
apiece which I think is
very fair price I was very happy to see
that these weren't like 20 plus dollars
and I think that they're in really
beautiful packaging they do feel a
little bit light but I'm totally fine
with that since I'm not paying a total
high-end price for them I would way
rather spend sixteen dollars and have
packaging that still looks nice but
maybe isn't as waited for colors there
weren't a ton of colors I want to see if
there's like six seven or eight colors I
chose a really dark color because I
wanted to see how it performed and
swatch and then I chose a really pretty
like Mavi cool toned nude this is very
similar to like steel a patina or
anything like that these are the type of
shades that I normally wear so I wanted
to get something that was more everyday
for me when I ordered on the website
they had free shipping with a $30
purchase so I paid nothing for shipping
which I think was great I ordered on
March 30th I got a email saying that it
was processed and out for shipment on
April 1st and then I do get my product
though until April 7th three to seven
days was what the shipping time was and
it definitely was in that range it just
took a while it's definitely not the
fastest shipping I've ever had I want to
show you the box that it came in because
this is one of the things I'm most
excited for it with the brand said
everything is just so stylized and it
just feels more like her then I feel
like the original and cosmetics launch
was so this is the box that it came in
even the tape that they used to like
tape the box is with they're kind of
like prismatic looking symbol which i
think is so awesome this is what the
inside of the box looks like it says
good luck which is like the thing she
says at the end of all of her videos if
you haven't seen any of michelle Fong's
videos i don't know what you're doing
but i'll leave a link down below yeah
you probably heard of her though and
then inside it came in tissue paper
again it has their logo printed on the
paper this sticker used on it is gold
and it's embossed with their logo too
this just has so much detail and just so
much thought put into it I really really
like that about it again more of the
symbol and then it came with a little
card here again she's really branding
herself I love it it says hello
beautiful thank you for welcoming em
into your beauty collection much love
and care went into all aspects of this
brand from design product and color and
I cannot wait to see the looks you'll
create please be sure to
me and Emma Cosmetics so that I can see
your beauty and magic much love thanks
and good luck
michelle phan i just wanted to show that
because i really feel like that's a big
part of this new launch and I'm really
I'm digging it I'm into it
you want to like see swatches now we'll
start with the darkest one I don't think
this is the one I'm gonna do my wear
test today I kind of thought about it
but I just I might eat pizza later and I
just don't feel like that's a fair test
so the dark one here is called Spanish
earth and these are called their
infinite lip clouds now like I said I
could not like get to the product
information on these so I can't tell you
like what the claims are exactly this is
obviously a liquid lipstick and it's
supposed to be very comfortable that's
why it's called the infinite lip cloud
so must be lightweight and not super
drying let me just watch it here for you
I'll also have close-up so you guys can
see the reason that I got this dark
colors because I really wanted to see
how this would like look on the lips
dark colors are really hard this is a
very light moosie formula so it's not a
heavy mousse it's like a very light
weight and almost feels kind of like
powdery I want to say which is really
nice I do think that this potentially
can get streaky I have worn this one
time so from the one time I wore it I
could get a nice coverage on my lips it
definitely took a little bit of work
nothing insane though this doesn't like
dry down crazy matte so so it's not one
of those ones where like you start
layering it and it gets all crazy
definitely nothing like my Kat Von D
damned nothing like that I've weighed
prefer this even the way that this feels
on the lips is just so much nicer too so
that's the first one I'll have insert
swatches for you guys to see packaging
and what the doe foot applicator looks
like this is a it's kind of like a chair
I believe this is very similar to like
Jeffrey stars I've never tried this but
this is my first one with that kind of
dough foot applicator and it was really
easy to get that off again it's not
those liquid lipsticks that's gonna dry
down and suck the life out of your lips
which i think will be a turn-off for a
lot of people but for me I love it I
love that it's not like that because I
don't like that I don't want a dry lip I
would way rather have something that is
a little less movable this is still
really matte and it's not gonna transfer
a ton but it's not like making me feel
like I'm in a desert the next color I
have here is muted mauve a really
fitting name this is definitely a me
color I love it so this is the one I'm
going to be wearing today they also had
a color on the website that was similar
in like color but different tones so it
was a little bit more brownie warm-toned
whereas this is like more Mavi cool
toned but it was still like that darker
nato's really beautiful but that one was
sold out by the time I got to the
website this is what I'm gonna be
wearing today on my lips I am going to
be using a lip liner because I just
normally would I'm not someone who's a
pro at applying liquid lipsticks because
I don't wear liquid lipsticks very often
and I'd rather have kind of like a nice
soft finish and being control of my lip
line so I will be using a NARS lip
pencil this is the color Marie he Island
Beach and then just so you guys have an
idea of the color that is it there so it
is very similar in tone and color and
it's just a little bit darker which I
prefer in a lip liner tough the darkness
on the outside so I'm gonna be lining my
lips with this and I'll speed that up so
you guys don't have to be here for seven
hours
I think that's pretty good for me I'm
pretty happy with it I kind of filled in
the outer portions as well so I'm going
to go in with this like I mentioned
before it does have that kind of like
chair doe foot applicator which
definitely pulls the product there so
we'll see how this goes I have worn this
one time but I did not wear it for a
long time so that's why this kind of
wear test will definitely be a good
first impression to see how it looks
this is definitely lighter than the lip
liner use
I feel like you can see the lip liner so
these definitely don't have like a full
opacity smell lies these smell kind of
just like a vanilla chocolate but not
too overpowering actually they taste
almost like they taste almost exactly
like this Stila ones for the doe foot
applicator I feel like it does give you
quite a bit of product um and it gives
me a lot of precision I feel like I
maybe wouldn't even need the lip liner
so I will definitely be testing that out
before I upload this so if I have any
different thoughts or just updated
thoughts they will be in the description
box so check that out but I feel like if
you are good at doing lip liner or even
if you're not definitely try without the
lip liner first because I could get
pretty precise I feel like with this I
feel like I definitely have a bit of
that like ombre lip going on I don't
know how much I like it
um so I'm just gonna go in and try to
make it a little bit more I don't know
blended I guess maybe it was a mistake
using this but that's what a first
impression is I guess so that's what it
looks like definitely is a matte on the
hand so you guys know this is the swatch
I put on earlier and I can rub it it's
definitely not kiss proof but it's not
like super runny or sticky or anything
so if you're not like moving your lips
around I think it's gonna stay I like
that it's not crazy full coverage again
I'm someone who likes a more natural lip
this is very intense for me personally
in my everyday life so I like that it's
a little bit sheer I'm excited to try it
out without the lip liner I like the
color of it and I like that it doesn't
dry down so I feel comfortable that this
is gonna stay put where I have it but
that I'm not gonna be like you know
wanting to peel my lips from my face
later on in the day I forgot to show you
guys the boxes I thought these were so
cute - I saved them so this is the box
again with the black and white theme it
has her logo on it and then on the top
it does have a color swatch so you guys
can see it so they don't come just like
in the tube they do have boxes I just
feel like for the price I wasn't
expecting to get so much extra awesome
stuff and to see something so well
branded and packaged well that's
everything I feel like I have for the
lip I will take you guys along with me
I'll do some check-ins I'll let you know
when I eat anything as well it's three
oh nine that's super late in the day
today when I'm getting started I'm gonna
try to keep it on for as long as I can
till the end of the day and then I will
let you guys know how where's what I
think overall though first impressions
I'm really happy with them and I think
that if you were actually really
interested in it and you wanted to try
something I would try one of them maybe
two to get free shipping and to see how
you like them but these aren't gonna be
permanent I believe so there's no reason
to like hurry if you don't make the
first launch you can always get them you
know later on she's gonna be having her
products for a while she wants to have a
makeup company I will let you know if
any of that changes in the description
and I will check in with you later in
the day hi guys I'm just doing a
check-in because we're at Costco and I'm
about to eat some pizza um so this is
what the lip looks like right now what
time is it it's 556 so that means it's
been on almost three hours I definitely
have somewhere in the center of the lip
basically where I don't have my lip
liner I'm really sorry if you can't hear
me it's kind of crazy here so I don't
know if the lip liner is affecting the
wear or not I don't know how long
lasting these are supposed to be because
the website didn't have like the
description of them but since they don't
dry down all the way I'm not expecting
this to last all day without some
touch-ups so I'll probably touch-up
after I eat but I will check in with you
guys good hey guys they just ate so this
is the
I don't know if there's like food on my
lung so play not you can definitely see
the ring of where my lip liner is and
then inside of that is definitely worn
away it's stained though which is kind
of nice I guess if you don't want
something wearing away I don't know if
it would wear way more evenly and if I
didn't have the lip liner and it was
just the actual lip product from em
cosmetics so there's that I kind of feel
like I was gonna like wipe it all off I
honestly feel like this is about a three
hour wear time and then you'd want to
reapply I am gonna test this more before
I upload this video so again look in the
description box but I think that's
everything for me for this video I'm
just gonna cut it short because I really
don't think it's that long wearing and I
want to wipe this off my lips it's not
uncomfortably dry or anything I just
want to have free lips guys okay that's
everything I'll see you in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
