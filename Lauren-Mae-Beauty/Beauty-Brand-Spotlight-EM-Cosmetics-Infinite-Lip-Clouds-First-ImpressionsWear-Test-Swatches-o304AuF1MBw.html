learn thanks so much for watching I
under the lip product on today because
we were going to be doing a first
impression / where test of the new and
cosmetics lip lip sprouts where is it
salt and the cosmetics is going through
a relaunch they will be officially
relaunching their cosmetics on the
seventeenth of April so coming up really
soon I don't know when this video will
get posted so i will leave a link to the
website down below if you are interested
in these once we do the review i was
lucky enough to get my hands on these
early she did like a pre-launch and I
was on the reddit group beauty guru
chatter and I software without it there
and then from there is immediately went
and bought them I don't know why you
guys know no liquid lipstick girl but I
just I was really intrigued I was really
excited that and the cosmetics is like
doing a whole separate thing I don't
think that their first launch of the
products is very good I hate could be
like I don't I'm not trying to be mean
or anything I just I don't know I just
expected more and this so far is
definitely giving it to me I have tried
Z's each once on my lips but just in
general everything about this concept
wise packaging and how its displayed
just everything that I've seen so far I
am just like excited for Michelle Phan
and just for em cosmetics this is going
to be a part of my beauty brand
spotlight series so if you want to check
out other brands that are less known or
just don't get a lot of pipes here on
YouTube I will leave that place looks
like down below I know people know about
Michelle Phan she's the one who started
on cosmetics but I feel like this new
launch I haven't heard anything about
this like I haven't heard anything so I
thought it'd be cool to let you guys
know what they are like how I like them
show you the swatches are the two colors
that I got but first let's talk a little
bit about the brand it's kind of hard I
don't know much about the brand because
the website doesn't have anything you
can't even like look at the liquid
lipsticks anymore I know they just sell
out in a day I was not expecting there
to be that much hype around this product
because like I said I hadn't heard
anything but in really glad that I was
able to get my hands on some of the
product so it will tell you what I do
know about these products and just kind
of like showing you packaging and all
that these are sixteen dollars apiece
which i think is a very fair price
I was very happy to see that these
weren't like 20 plus dollars and I think
that they're in really beautiful
packaging they do feel a little bit
light but I'm totally finding that since
i'm not paying a total high-end price
for them i would way rather spend $15
and have packaging that still looks nice
but maybe isn't as waited for colors
there weren't a ton of color i want to
sit there's like six seven or eight
colors i chose a really dark color than
i wanted to see how it performs and
swatch and then i chose a really pretty
like mommy cool toned new it is very
similar to lexi lapetina or anything
like that these did the tattoo shades
that I normally wear so I wanted to get
something that was more everyday for me
when I ordered on the website they had
free shipping with a thirty dollar
purchase so I paid nothing for shipping
which I think was great i ordered
unmarked 30th i bought a email saying
that it was processed and out for
shipment on april first and then i
didn't get my product though until april
seven three to seven days was what the
shipping time was and it definitely was
in that range it just took a while it's
definitely not the fastest shipping I've
ever had I want to show you the box that
I came in because this is one of the
things I'm most excited work with the
brand that everything is just so
stylized and it just feels more like her
than I feel like the original and
cosmetics launch was so this is the box
that it came in even the tape that they
used to like take the box is with their
kind of like prismatic looking symbol
which i think is so awesome this is what
the inside of the box looks like it says
good luck which is like the thing she
serves at the end of all of her videos
you haven't seen any in the shell songs
videos I don't know what you're doing
but i'll leave a link down below yeah
you probably heard of her though and
then inside it came in tissue paper
again it has their logo printed on the
paper the sticker used on it is gold and
it's in boss with their logo to this
just has so much detail and just so much
thought put into it I really really like
that about it again more of the symbol
and then it came with a little card here
again she's really branding herself I
love it is it so beautiful thank you for
welcoming and into your beauty
collection much love and care went into
all aspects of this brand from design to
prod
in color and I cannot wait to see the
look feel create please be sure to tag
me at em cosmetics so that I can see
your beauty and magic much love thanks
and good luck on the shelf on I prefer
to show that because I really feel like
that's a big part of this new launch and
I'm really I'm digging it I'm into it
you want to like see swatches narrow
will serve us the darkest one I don't
think this is the one I'm going to do my
where test today I kind of thought about
it but I just I might eat pizza later
and I still feel like that's a fair test
so the dark one here is called Spanish
earth and these are called their
infinite list clouds now like I said I
could not like get to the product
information on me so I can't tell you
like what the claims are exactly this is
obviously a liquid lipstick and it's
supposed to be very comfortable that's
why it's called the infinite list cloud
so if you light weight and not super dry
let me just watch it here for you also
have closed up so you guys can see the
reason I got this dark colors because I
really wanted to see how this would like
look on the lips dark colors are really
hard this is a very light musii formula
so it's not a heavy moose it's like very
lightweight and almost feels kind of
like powdery i want to say which is
really nice i do think that this
potentially can get streaky i have won
this one time so from the one time I
wore it I could get a nice coverage on
my lips it definitely took a little bit
of work nothing insane though this isn't
like dried down crazy Matt so so it's
not one of those ones where like you
start layering it and it gets all crazy
definitely nothing like my Kat Von D
damned nothing like that way prefer this
even the way this feels on the lips is
just so much nicer too so that's the
first one I'll have inserts watches for
you guys to see packaging and what the
joke foot applicator looks like this is
a it's kind of like a chair I believe
this is very so much less Jeffrey start
I've never tried this but this is my
first one with that kind of doe foot
applicator and it was really easy to get
that off again it's not
liquid lipsticks that's going to dry
down and suck the life out of your lips
which I think will be a turn-off for a
lot of people for me i love it i love
that it smell like that because i don't
like that i don't want a dry lips i
would way rather have something that is
a little less movable this is still
really mad and it's not going to
transfer a ton but it's not like making
me feel like i'm in a desert the next
quarter hatch here is muted mob a really
fitting name this is definitely a mean
color I love it so this is what I'm
going to be wearing today they also have
a color on the website that was similar
in my color but different tone so it's a
little bit more brownie warm tone
where's this is like more ma be cool
tones but it would still like that
darker nato's really beautiful but that
one was sold out by the time I got to
the website this is what I may be
wearing today on my list I am going to
be using a lip liner because I just
normally would I'm not the one who's a
pro at applying liquid lipsticks because
I don't wear liquid lipsticks very often
and I'd rather have kind of like a nice
soft finish and be in control of my lip
line so i will be using a nard Tunsil
this is the color Mary ki Island Beach
and then just you guys have an idea of
the color that is it there so it is very
similar in tone and color and it's just
a little bit darker which I prefer in a
lip liner toss the darkness on the
outside so I'm going to be minding my
lips with this and I'll speed that up to
you guys don't have to be here for seven
hours
I think that's pretty good for me I'm
pretty happy with it I kind of filled in
the outer portions as well so I'm going
to go in with this like I mentioned
before it does have that kind of like
chair doe foot applicator which
definitely pulls a product there so
we'll see how this goes i have worn is
one time but i do not wear it for a long
time so that's why this kind of where
test it will definitely be a good first
impression to see how it looks
this is definitely lighter than the lip
liner use
I feel like you can see the lip liner so
these definitely don't have like a full
opacity smell lines these smell kinda
just like a vanilla chocolate but not
too overpowering actually they taste
almost like they taste almost exactly
like this Stila one for the doe foot
applicator to like it does give you
quite a bit of product and it gave me a
lot of precision I feel like I maybe
wouldn't even need the lip liner so I
will definitely be testing that out
before i upload this so if i have any
different thought so we're just updated
thoughts they will be in the description
box to check that out but I feel like if
you are good at doing lip liner or even
if you're not definitely try without the
lip liner first because I could get
pretty precise I feel like with it I
feel like I definitely have a bit of
that like ombre lip going on I don't
know how much I like it I'm so I'm just
going to go in and try to make it a
little bit more I don't know blended I
guess maybe it was a mistake using this
but that's what the first regression is
I guess so that's what it looks like
definitely is a match on the hand so you
know this is the swatch I put on earlier
and I can rub it it's definitely not
kiss brutal but it's not like super
runny or sticky or anything so if you're
not like moving your lips around I think
it's going to stay I like that it's not
crazy full coverage again I'm someone
who likes a more natural lip this is
very intense for me personally in my
everyday life so I like that it's a
little bit sheer I'm excited to try it
out without the lip liner I like the
color of it and i like that it doesn't
write down so i feel comfortable that
this is going to stay put where I have
it but that I'm not going to be like you
know wanting to peel my lips tournaments
face later on in the day I forgot to
show there's the boxes I thought these
were so cute too I saved them so this is
the box again with the black and white
theme it has her logo on it and then on
the top it does have a color swatch so
you guys can see it so they don't come
just like in the tube they do have boxes
I just feel like for the price I wasn't
expecting to get so much extra awesome
stuff and to see something so well
branded and packaged well that's
everything I feel like I have for this
lip I will take you guys along with me
I'll do some check-ins I'll let you know
when I eat anything as well it's 30
super late in the day today when i'm
getting started i'm going to try to keep
it on for as long as I can till the end
of the day and then I will let you guys
know how where is what I think overall
though first impressions I'm really
happy with them and I think that if you
were actually really interested in it
and you wanted to try something I would
try one of them maybe two to get free
shipping and see how you like them but
these are going to be permanent i
believe so there's no reason to like
hurry if you don't make the first launch
you can always get them you know later
on she's going to be having her products
for a while she wants to have a makeup
company I will let you know if any of
that changes in the description and I
will check in with you later in the day
hi guys I'm just doing a check-in
because we're at costco and I'm about to
eat some pizza so this is what the lip
looks like right now what time is it 5
50 60 that means it's been on almost
three hours I definitely have somewhere
in the center of the lid basically where
I don't have my lip liner I'm really
sorry if you can't hear me at Santa
crazy here so I don't know if the lip
liner is affecting the wear or not I
don't know how long lasting these are
supposed to be because the website
didn't have like the description of them
but since they don't dry down all the
way I'm not expecting this to last all
day without some touch-ups so I'll
probably touch up after i eat but i will
check in with you guys soon hey guys we
just say so this is the result I don't
know if there's like food on my level so
pulling on you can definitely see the
ring of where my lip liner is and then
inside of that is definitely ward away
it's Jane though which is kind of nice i
guess if you don't want something
wearing away I don't know if it would
wear way more evenly if I don't have the
lip liner and it was just the actual lip
product from Memphis Maddox so
there's that I kind of feel like it was
kind of like wipe it all off I honestly
feel like this is about a three-hour
where time and then you'd want to
reapply i am going to test this more
before i upload this video so again look
in the description box but i think
that's everything for me for this video
I'm just going to cut it short because I
really don't think it's that long
wearing and I want to watch this off my
lips it's not uncomfortably dry or
anything I just want to have free lips
guys ok that's everything i'll see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
