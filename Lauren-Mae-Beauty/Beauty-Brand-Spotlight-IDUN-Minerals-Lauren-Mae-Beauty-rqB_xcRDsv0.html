Lauren thanks so much for watching I'm
really excited to bring you guys this
video because it is a start of a new
series here on my channel this is going
to be called beauty brand spotlight and
the whole premise and the inspiration
behind this is just showcasing different
brands and what we hear about all the
time
I'm not gonna lie I'm just kind of sick
of hearing about the same five brands
over and over and over it doesn't mean I
hate those brands it's just I think
we're all beauty lovers here in this
community and I'm ready to just talk
about other brands that maybe don't get
as much love even if they're known or
brands that we've maybe never heard of
or indie brands or just just different
stuff we don't all have to use the same
makeup and I think it's fun to explore I
think that's part of the reason why we
you know have gravitated to the beauty
community online I just want to have a
place to showcase different beauty
brands so sometimes these will be sent
to me sometimes they'll be just what I
bought and they won't have a similar
format like it might be reviews it might
be a haul it might be a tutorial using
them it's just in some way focusing on a
brand that maybe everyone doesn't know
I'm just kind of sick of hearing about
morphe and two-faced let's be real right
anyway I hope you guys enjoy this idea
and series if you have any brands that
you think would be awesome or you want
me to test out or whatever definitely
let me know down below anyway let's get
into this brand I was sent these items
from octa Lee if you guys don't know
about actually I will leave a link down
below there's one always down below
there's a lot of stuff on actually all
the time and I kind of went through
stuff that's been on there a while and I
found the brand Eden minerals and I was
really excited to try out a bunch of
different things from their range and
these are my opinions on them you'll see
in this video that just because it's a
new Beauty brand and I'm excited to try
it doesn't mean that the products are
always gonna be amazing or work out for
me I will always give you guys a hundred
percent honest review whether it's scent
whether I bought it it doesn't matter
it's just what I think about it right so
I do want to give you a little bit of
background on the brand because I think
that that's super important I always
find when I know a little bit more about
a brand that I'm just more connected to
it and it just puts everything in a
different perspective to me and I kind
of enjoy that I just like
hearing about brands and where they
started and like their idea behind the
products and why they look the way they
look I think that's really cool as
someone who wants to eventually have my
own beauty brand I think it's just
interesting I don't know hopefully you
guys like it too so I will leave
timestamps down below if you just want
to get into the review or certain
products but let's get into a little bit
about the brand this is a Swedish brand
and these products are actually sold in
Swedish pharmacies so in Europe a lot of
beauty brands and makeup are sold at
like pharmacies where you can get like
kind of like a Walgreens but it's a
little bit more like a medicine base and
skincare base even the makeup that's
sold there is a lot more natural there's
no way you're gonna go in and find like
a bright pink eyeshadow usually I feel
like it's more mineral based skincare
base and that's exactly what this brand
is there are stricter rules for them to
go through to be sold in these
pharmacies so that's a huge base of this
brand because of those restrictions on
what they can have in their products and
what they can sell in a pharmacy this
brain has no artificial ingredients
no talc oils silicones fragrances
bismuth oxychloride I think that's how
you say it it has no parabens and no
nanoparticles in it it is more of like a
clean line and for your skin so it's
supposed to be helping your skin not
just covering up whatever you're trying
to perfect this is also a cruelty-free
brand if any of you guys are wondering I
know a lot of people in the project
panic community are cruelty free and
that being said this also is a high-end
brand to me price-wise it definitely
rings higher I feel like the reason for
that is one the packaging is really
pretty you'll see in a second but it
also just has better ingredients in it
so that can raise the cost the name even
is a Norse goddess and she is the
goddess of immortality and beauty she is
featured all on the packaging so this is
one of the compacts this is the blush
and the woman on the front here is a
depiction of the goddess this is another
compact this is the eye shadow and
here's another just different depiction
and then just to show you some packaging
this is an
other one I think that's really cool how
they have integrated that into the
packaging I don't know I just I really
like this really artsy feel of the
packaging I think it's so pretty so
different and really ties in their whole
message of like beauty so let's just get
into the review I have been using these
products for a little bit now I
definitely have some opinions on them I
want to start off with the foundation
this is the north skin pure mineral
illuminating foundation now
someone told me on my Instagram post
because I did post about this on
Instagram that noir skin means Northern
Lights and I think that's really cool
since it is an illuminating foundation I
just really like that I don't know why I
think the Northern Lights are so
romantic to me so anyway let's talk
about packaging this is really beautiful
packaging it's in a frosted glass
container this is a plastic lid and then
it does have a pump this reminds me of
the Dior foundation I don't know it just
looks like the Dior foundation I love
that this does retail for 35 dollars so
it is pricey so I'm glad the packaging
is really nice I have the shade Ingrid
212 I will say they don't have the
largest amount of shades in their range
so if you can never find a foundation
light enough for you
this shade range should have something
for you
this one's too dark for me they didn't
have a ton left on octoly so I just did
the best that I could
that's it there I know it doesn't look
like it's that dark for me but when I
was wearing it it just didn't it didn't
look good hot in my face I needed
something just a little bit lighter so I
really like this foundation I really
really wish that I had my right skin
tone color because I would love to just
wear this foundation by itself I love
the way this looks on the skin it's
super illuminating I feel like it gives
you that dewy radiant finish it's not
greasy looking and the way it looks on
the skin is just beautiful and flawless
it just looks like your skin is better
than it is but doesn't look cakey or
noticeable I just really like the finish
of this foundation I get a solid medium
coverage when I use this but you can
definitely if you wanted to share it out
I personally don't like adding too much
of this I like just doing like an easy
layer maybe going back over in a couple
places I just like to keep that
natural look going with it so I really
enjoy this foundation it does have a
smell to it so be prepared for that it's
a little bit floral it just reminds me
of like I don't know how I imagined ooh
how I imagined almost like your perfumes
to smell
I don't smell it throughout the day but
when I am applying it I definitely do
smell it so that is just something to
keep in mind but other than that
formulation wise I really do like it I
definitely suggest this for people with
dry skin or normal skin or someone
looking for that really dewy complexion
I think this is just a beautiful
foundation and I would love to have it
in my color I do mix it right now and it
works that way too I just a lot of my
foundations that are light enough to mix
in with this are mattifying and it just
kind of takes away from the entire
purpose of this foundation I feel like
but highly suggest this if you can get
over the scent and if you can find your
color I love it next I picked up the
concealer and this is the concealer in
the shade Harv have its havr II and this
is a traditional like pen click up style
concealer now this concealer is actually
light enough for me which is amazing and
this gives a just nice light coverage to
the skin it's definitely not gonna cover
super dark circles but if you're looking
for just something easy natural nothing
too heavy on the skin I think this is
really beautiful I love the luminosity
it gives I don't like using this with
the foundation just as preference
because sometimes I don't want a super
Dewey complexion and so this is just
nice under the eyes so that I can kind
of have like maybe heavier skin but not
heavy under the eyes it just kind of
balances it out for me now this also has
a smell to it but this smells almost
like a crayon to me and I don't know if
that's just the smell of it or if it's
off it obviously was sent to me brand
new so I'm hoping that it just is the
smell of it but it does have kind of a
strange scent to me as well yeah it just
smells kind of like a crayon to me so I
do really like the formula again it's
just the smell this brand keep in mind
it's just very much the everyday woman
someone who wants to just look a little
bit better than they normally do or
naturally do but still wants to look at
themselves still wants to look natural
and I think that they do that woman
do make up for that woman super well
let's move on to the compacts these are
so beautiful I absolutely love them I
have the blush here in half torn and
this one is so beautiful it's just a
peachy pink and the reason they have
apples all over I don't know if you've
noticed but they have an apple on all
their products because there is a myth
with the goddess about her apples of
immortality it's a whole story
which explains why we have the different
seasons and so I just like seeing that
imagery throughout their products and
also knowing the story behind it I think
is really cool anyway I feel like the
pigmentation on this is perfect it's not
too pigmented but it's not so sure that
you continuously have to build it up it
has a slight sheen to it but nothing too
sparkly I will say with my powder brush
when I dip it in it does kick up quite a
bit of powder that's not the biggest
problem for me I don't mind that but I
know a lot of people don't like that so
keep that in mind but I think this is
just such a beautiful color every day
they have so many beautiful colors on
the website obviously that will be
linked down below but I really enjoyed
this blush and some of my favorite
products that I picked up next we have
the eye shadows and I got the eye shadow
quad in 405 I cannot even begin to
pronounce the actual name of this quad
so I won't but this is it here I picked
it because it has this really pretty
purple color and I really just wanted to
try it out and do something a little bit
out of the box they have a lot of great
neutrals on their site this is probably
the most crazy that they have these are
super pigmented shadows they're really
buttery and I was so excited to try
these out I don't know what it is but I
cannot make these work on my eyes I feel
like this might be the situation that's
deafening the poll talks about with the
Mario palette you just do one all over
the lid and just kind of leave it or two
but you don't get too crazy with
blending because it just becomes crazy
muddy mess that's just what I kept
getting with this so which is so sad
because I had the highest hopes and knew
I would love this like as long as it was
pigmented I knew I was gonna love this
and I just can't quite make them work I
feel like every time I try to do a look
with these I just don't like the way my
eyeshadow
looks so I don't know I really like this
color here that's like light shimmery
shade I was using it as a highlight and
it's really pretty it's kind of intense
but really pretty I feel like if you
just like really simple eye shadow maybe
sweeping one color across the lid you'll
really like this this taupe color is
really pretty I just personally couldn't
make it work it also has no mattes in it
so if that's something that's a no-go
for you these are all shimmery I find
that with mineral cosmetics a lot of the
times that's how quads are so it's
beautiful but I just couldn't make it
work and I couldn't make any of the
looks that I tried with this work which
made me so sad because again quality
wise they're really pretty so I don't
know if it's just me or what was up with
that it was like this weird Bermuda
Triangle of eyeshadow looks for me on
that one
I have two more products to talk about I
will say right now cuz I just remembered
but I do have a coupon code that they
let me have it's not an affiliate link I
think you can just get this if you go to
the u.s. website it's like on the top of
the banner cuz I was checking out the
website before I film this so I will
leave it linked down below if you're
interested I think it's 20% off or 25%
off obviously all of it will be linked
down below but again it's not an
affiliate link I'm not making any money
off that link it's just a code that they
have for you guys / I think that they're
just doing to promote their website
because they just opened up a u.s.
website so anyway moving on let's talk
about the mascara the packaging on this
is absolutely stunning I love this it's
heavy its metal it's rose gold it's
beautiful this is their her mascara er
and it's the ultimate volume buildable
care mascara this reminds me of the
realist all mascaras that I use because
of the fact that opthamologist tested
it's sold in pharmacies just like real
estill is I really like that about it
but it's like good for your eye you know
it's good for your eyes it doesn't have
any claims of like lengthening your
lashes or anything but here is the wand
it's a pretty large wand I really do
like this mascara that's what's on my
lashes though brush was a little big for
me to get used to at first but I am used
to it now I find that most mascaras work
on me really well I don't get any
flaking or
our product underneath my eyes and it
doesn't irritate my eyes so I really do
like this mascara I don't know if I'd
pay the price for it but I'm definitely
gonna use it up and finish it if you
were like wanting to try it I think it's
really good and the last is their lip
gloss this is the lip gloss in josephine
and the color of this I think it's
absolutely stunning and beautiful it's
this cool toned dusty Mavi purple color
and these have quite a bit of
pigmentation to them I think that
they're really nice they're not too
sticky but they're not not sticky
they're kind of an in-between so they do
last on your lips for a good amount of
time I feel like the color range is
their number one most positive attribute
about this product they just have really
pretty colors I definitely suggest
checking them out if you're interested I
just did not like this smell of this
product this has a rose and floral scent
to it so that's just like why why did
you have to do that why couldn't you
make that not happen I'd rather it be
nothing or sweet or vanilla or mint just
anything other than floral so that kind
of kills it for me I do think it's
really beautiful though I think it's a
pretty product but again with the scent
what's up with these scents come on so
those are my individual product reviews
on the brand
Ethan minerals overall I think the
quality of the products are really nice
I definitely can see why people would
like them I just feel like they're more
fitted for the everyday consumer someone
who doesn't spend a lot of time in their
makeup maybe just has one makeup bag
that they bring with them like something
more natural can get over the smell of
the products I just feel like the people
on the beauty community here on YouTube
maybe if you have a lot of makeup or if
you're more experienced with makeup it
might not be the best to you because you
already have a million things like this
you don't need basics or staples and
you're ready for something new and
exciting and I just don't know if that's
it so for me I highly suggest the
foundation portions especially if you're
wanting something more natural even if
you do more intense eye looks or
whatever
my least favorite product is probably
the eyeshadow is just because they were
the most disappointing for me but
overall I think the brand is really
great and I was really excited to try it
out let me know if you've tried this
brand before
what your thoughts are or if there's
anything that was interesting to you
also again if there's anything that you
want me to test out or any brand
suggestions that you have for me
definitely let me know down below and
that's everything I hope yours are
having a wonderful day and I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
