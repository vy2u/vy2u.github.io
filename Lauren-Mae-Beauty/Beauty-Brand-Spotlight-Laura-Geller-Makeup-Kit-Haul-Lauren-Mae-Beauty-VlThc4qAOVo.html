Lauren I'm super excited to be bringing
you this video because this is my second
installment of my beauty brand spotlight
this is going to be a haul of different
laura geller products that i picked up
recently I kind of went a little crazy
on the website I do get a pro discount
on our website which is another reason I
love Laura Geller I know Laura is not
the most unheard-of brand but the series
is all about giving kudos where it's due
and I thought it would be really fun to
talk about Laura Geller while hauling
some of her products because I truly
like Laura Keller products and I feel
like they just don't get enough hype I
don't feel like they get enough love and
they're really good
I know gilded honey is really popular
but on YouTube I just don't see your
products enough and I want to see them
more so here I am creating a whole video
dedicated like before I will have a time
stamp or let you know when the actual
haul starts but I did want to let you
know a little bit about laura geller
products I think that's really
interesting and fun to know a little bit
of background on products and brands
that you're going to be buying and
spending your money on this is just like
a quick little background laura geller
is a pro makeup artist she lives in New
York City she started doing like
Broadway stuff and then had like
celebrity clients and through that and
her love of makeup she decided that she
wanted to create a line for the everyday
woman something that's going to be fun
and easy to use it's going to make
beauty and makeup more accessible to
everyone and that's kind of the
inspiration behind it something else I
really love about the brand it is
cruelty free which is great I know a lot
of you guys will love that also all of
her baked products are gluten free which
is great Laura Geller herself also gives
a lot of money to charities she's really
involved with fighting cancer and
helping support charities that do
research for cancer cures and things
like that which i think is really
awesome it always feels good to hear
about how people spend their money how
they like to donate their time and I
think that's really amazing you can find
laura geller products online at Ulta on
QVC she started with QVC 20 years ago
which is insane and she's one of the top
three color cosmetic brands selling on
there so QVC Ulta and obviously her
website there are other websites as well
but those are like
three main places to find your products
anyway let's get into it
I've been keeping these boxes around so
that I can show you and it can be like
look a little bit nicer since a lot of
these products I have been trying or
putting in my kit or whatnot so if I've
used something I have a little bit of a
review I'll talk about it
stop talking Lauren let's get into the
products I thought I would just start
out with a bang this is the so
scrumptious kit laura geller does a ton
of kits which I feel like if you don't
have a pro discount these are the best
ways to try it a lot of products try out
full sizes of products and save a ton of
money so this is a $59 value again I did
get it on sale too she had like a really
good sale going on and then I got the
discount on top of that so that's
seriously why I went so crazy I also
bought my mom some stuff she got so much
stuff for $50 it was crazy
anyway this came with five different
products plus a brush and what they're
known for the most would be their baked
products and their spackle I really
wanted to have the spackle in my kit I
feel like I usually need something
that's a little bit in the middle
nothing too drying or poor filling and
nothing too hydrating and I feel like
this is a nice one so specifically this
is the spackle treatment even tone
makeup primer as you will see from this
haul there's a lot of spackle it also
came with a lip gloss a really pretty
color these are the types of colors I
used to make it all the time so that's
where I will be putting this the brush
is not my favorite one side is like
actually a brush and the other side is a
sponge so this is the brush it's okay
and this is the sponge not my favorite
though I probably will just pass this on
and then the main three products this is
the baked eyeshadow sensation trio and
tiramisu and I really mostly want to use
this as a highlighter actually I think
that both of these mixed together look
really pretty and give just a nice glow
to the skin it has almost like this
pinky shift that's how I'm going to use
it I'm gonna keep it in my kit that way
I can always use this as like an
eyeshadow or a bronzer or whatever I
really want to and that's
really like to watch a bit there so
that's how I'm going to be using that it
is for eyeshadow though I've never
really used any of her eyeshadow
products I'm mostly just like her face
products maybe I should try a palette
though and do a first impression next to
have be balanced and brighten the
foundation in medium her powder
foundations are something that's really
popular they give really nice coverage
but still look really natural on the
skin it's kind of hard to swatch a
foundation but it's down here I really
want to have this in my kit just to put
on for a really easy makeup something is
supposed to look maybe more natural but
just gives a little bit of coverage and
so I got this one in medium even though
it doesn't fit me for my clients and the
last thing in this kit I can't believe
we're only on the first kit here this is
a blush in the color traffic hues this
is a permanent blush so you can just buy
the blush if you want to I think that
her blushes are like almost $30 so you
might as well find a kit with a lot of
products you like in it or even in just
a couple and it'll be worth it here is a
really nice light swatch of it they're
really pretty warm Corley kind of golden
need pink blushes are some my favorite
products from her I think that they just
look so nice and radiant on the skin you
look healthy and natural and nothing too
much and they probably are one of the
products I suggest the most let me wash
my hand and I'll also give you a swatch
really fast of that lip gloss this is
exactly the type of gloss that like I
just like something that definitely will
change the color of the lips but isn't
gonna look messy or too opaque where
things can get crazy real fast I can't
wait to throw all these boxes in the
garbage we got to keep this thing going
because it this is going to be alone
along a video next we have another
little set this is the berry glow trio
this has another sparkle in it it has
another lip gloss and then it has a
blush and this is a different formula
blush this is their big gelato swirl
blush in plum berry
I mostly got this because I just thought
it was a good value and I really wanted
to try one of these blushes I feel like
out of the things talked about these
blushes and also the highlighters that
are in the same formula are very popular
so I wanted to at least get one this
will be a great blush to have in my kit
for deeper skin tones it's going to be
rich enough to really pop and look just
nice and vibrant I think it'd also be
just a beautiful eyeshadow so
really happy with this I have another
spackle this is the champagne one so it
has a little bit more of a glow to it
I'm excited to also have another option
of this in my kit last again is that lip
gloss this is in the color strawberry
cake no this isn't the color strawberry
cream this is also a color I would use
so much in my kit these natural nudie
pinky type of colors are just the most
popular I've gotten new stuff for my kit
I have like this big old zip Rolly case
now instead of my original train case so
if you guys want like an updated my
makeup kit video or something let me
know this is a really tiny kit but this
is the French vanilla
baked highlighter with an applicator
again with the brush I'm just gonna
totally check that I'm not really into
the sponge tip she does kind of a lot of
those I can see the value in them I know
a lot of people just hate them I just I
find that they're hard to clean so I
definitely would not use these for
clients they're just it's too much of a
hassle honestly so basically in this
huge box all I really wanted was this
little highlighter and this is my
absolute favorite this was in my 2016
beauty favorites and I just love it i
think this highlighter is just stunning
it's a very natural nice highlight
without looking too metallic or glittery
so i really wanted to have this in my
kit i'm also almost done with the one
i'm using i figure it'll be nice to have
this weather in my kit or for myself
we'll see now it's kind of a
free-for-all
because not a lot of this stuff is like
in kids or anything anymore so let's
start off with like foundations and face
products she had some of the luminous
veil stick cream foundations on sale and
i thought that these would be great
additions to my kit so i picked them up
this is the box that they came in i got
three different colors the first one is
golden medium that's what it looks like
I really like this formula I think it
works really nice on the skin and I
personally like cream foundations when
I'm working on set liquid is nice too
but cream it's just easy to mix it's
easy it's just easier for whatever
reason for me the next color is medium
these have almost like a core that's a
different than the outside I'm still
playing around with these but I have
been you
I'm on set and I do really like them I
do think that these run a little bit
light so on here this is the color light
this is the color medium and this is
golden medium
I feel like usually light is a little
bit dark on me and this light is almost
too like for my own skin tone so I think
that these are really nice I almost wish
they came a little bit darker though
when I bought them online I just thought
that they would be darker and that's why
I got the medium and the golden medium
most of the people I work on are darker
whether they're tan or just not super
fair so I do really like them I almost
just wish I got the color like tan or
something a little bit darker I did pick
up one concealer this is the easy cover
up hydrating concealer crayon I would
have picked this up in other colors but
the only one that they had left on the
site was the color tan and I loved it
this is like the perfect color for a lot
of people that I work on it's quite dark
but it's really warm
it just works really well and I also
find that I can mix this you can see
that I've been using my spatula on it
but I can mix this with lighter
concealers to just kind of give them a
little bit of warmth give them a little
bit darker pigmentation and it just
works really well so I'm really happy
with this I've really been enjoying this
I wish it came in more colors I think
that it's just a really nice formula
looks great on the skin and not too
heavy really happy with this I have a
feeling that some of these products
because they were on the sale either
getting repackaged or they are being
discontinued because they were on such
like a super sale and usually you know
that's when brands are trying to like
clear stuff out because they don't want
anymore for whatever reason but I didn't
really like that concealer I thought it
was really good especially because it's
kind of scared of it being in a stick
like that that it might be dry but it's
really nice I'm really happy with that I
have a few more powders here now there's
a mix of stuff here so we'll just get
into it the first one in this packaging
is just a mattifying a translucent
powder but it's pressed I really like
having a pressed translucent powder on
set loose powder is great but if you're
just trying to touch-up write them in
there sometimes it just doesn't work out
well so I did pick this up and I just
have this and makes up
it works nicely it definitely can leave
a white cast on darker skin tones them
so it's not like the best for really
dark skin tones I also picked up two
other colors of the balance and brighten
like powder foundation I picked up the
color tan so this is for a little bit of
deeper skin tones I also like using
darker powders like this to kind of warm
up the skin if I'm working on someone
who is of like a light medium skin tone
and I find that once I kind of like go
in and even out their skin tone they're
just looking like a little too one tone
I can go in and kind of Pat this on the
temples on the perimeters of the face a
little bit in the hollow of the cheek
and it just kind of brings some life
back to their face gives it a little bit
of dimension and it's not like contoured
but just looks like alive and I really
like that so I was thinking that's how I
could use this and then the other color
I got was porcelain now this is like
really like once again it's great that
these are so fair but this powder is a
little bit fair for my entire skin so
I've been using this more under the eyes
this is something that I think I might
actually have to put in my kit I was
thinking about using it for myself but
I'm definitely a light and not a
porcelain it is find that these colors
are running a little bit light and the
last powder that I have here this is the
baked setting powder in tan I picked
this up because I thought this would
work really similarly to the medium
powder and this has just a really nice
consistency to it this is not overly
pigmented so I feel like it'll be nice
for a light dusting if I find that
someone's looking a little ashy or just
you know too washed out this will be a
nice color to kind of pop on the skin
and give them a little bit of life let's
finish up with like base products
primers those types of things I picked
up a couple different primers this is
the real deal remedy stick and this is a
mattifying primer this comes in quite
interesting packaging you like twist it
up like this and it's in a stick I got
this because I figured this is going to
be one of those super mattifying primers
that you can put on the skin and
instantly make someone mad I'm going to
be using this mostly for men
I find that guys a lot of the
have a lot of shine on their foreheads
and it's almost the shine that powder
cannot kick it's just really shiny nice
skin and it's not like they're oily and
powder just doesn't stick to it so
primers like this and modifiers like
this have worked really well on those so
that's I'm gonna be using that and I'm
excited to have it on my kit there was a
pack on there for two primers coming
together for like $25 which is an
amazing deal and then again my discount
on top of it so it came with a bran
spackle treatment and an SPF 30 speckle
treatment now I'm a little disappointed
in this one and I'll tell you why the
packaging on this is super nice but
inside this is like older looking
packaging so I don't know why that is
whatever I'd be fine with that I'm
excited to try the bronze but for the
SPF 31 this expired on 1016 so it's not
super expired and I'm sure it's just the
SPF but it's kind of frustrating to get
sent an expired product no matter if
it's on like a crazy good clearance or
whatever like I don't think a branch
should be selling that so I'm going to
be contacting customer service and
hopefully they'll be really helpful and
you know trade this out for me or do
something for me because that's not
exactly good I really like regular but I
am definitely disappointed in that and I
you mostly just hope that her customer
service will handle it really well for
me and that it won't be an issue I
didn't want to have to talk about that
but you know that's how it is and that's
the truth moving on to other primers
these are for the eye I got these Bakkal
eyelid primer and I just needed a new
primer for my kit I really like the
lorac one but I'm almost running out and
I've used that twice but I just don't
like if I can like get it on a good deal
primer so expensive and I like that this
is a higher-end brand so I got that for
my kit and then I also got an under eye
primer I've never tried an under eye
primer but again this was on a good sale
and I was kind of excited to kind of try
and see if this will work I thought
maybe I could use this I wouldn't
obviously put it on the eye like that
but I thought I could use this under the
eye to maybe stop creasing cuz I do find
that some people just have an issue with
creasing so I'm gonna try this out see
if it works it might be great it might
not be we'll see hopefully it's really
awesome though and
with creasing because that's why about
it we have some face products left but
these are all like more color cosmetics
so I decided to get a big old disc this
is the Laura Geller sunset glow baked
color and contour like palette almost
same tone and this has a bronzer a
highlighter and a blush in it I thought
this would be really nice for in my kids
/ just for myself something that has a
lot of products in it all in one place I
also thought this would be great for
more like Bridal makeup or something
like that these are really easy to use
colors and nothing's crazy pigmented
that's gonna look like a natural and to
me that's like the best part about this
brand that you can just easily do this
you don't don't worry about over
applying and looking crazy I picked up
this matte bronzer for myself this is
the baked impressions bronzer and this
is a water-resistant matte bronzer in
the shade light I believe there were
three shades of this I thought this
would be exciting to try out to see how
light it really was since I'm obviously
quite pale and I am pretty dang happy
with the way that this bronzer looks
it's not too warm it's not too cool it
doing really great so if you find that
you're looking for a bronzer that's not
gonna look too just dark on your skin if
you're really fair I haven't suggest
this it's nice that this is matte
because a lot of these baked products
aren't matte for another face type of
product this is the big toy letter in
golden rose and this is such a pretty
color it's very similar to french
vanilla but this is more pink toned I
find this also has a bit more shine on
it this was in my recent top 5 picks for
January and I I just highly suggested
they also have one other color and stock
that's a little bit deeper so if you
have a deeper skin tone
I suggest that one but they're the are
swatch next to each other so this is the
golden rose and this one's French
vanilla so this one definitely has a
higher shine on it but they're both
really pretty definitely nothing
metallic still highly suggestive
separating and you know because they
love the blushes I wanted to pick up
more of the blushes so I picked up this
a baked art blush and highlighter in
pink Valentine
I've actually been seeing this around
unlike all cosmetics wholesale in
different places and I've wanted to get
it because want it's a blush to as a
Hearton it's so key
this is a really pretty color it reminds
me of Milani Luminoso because it's quite
shiny that highlighter in the middle
definitely adds quite a bit of shine to
it I just think that this is really
pretty eye this is it swirl together
this is the blush and this is just the
highlight really like this I'm excited
to have another one to kind of play
around with and check out and the last
blush that I got is the baked flambe
blush in peach crumble
this isn't like different packaging so
that's interesting but it's a kind of a
similar color it's a little bit deeper
though i swatched it on the top here so
how does just like a little bit of a
deeper almost brown tone to it and it
definitely doesn't have as high of a
sheen as the last one this is probably
gonna be more of like a personal one
seeing with this in my collection and
not necessarily in my kit last - kind of
like product sets these are all lip
products they had a really good deal on
their lip liners and I find that I just
I want like so many lip liners for my
kit I don't know what it is I just
really like having lip liners in my kit
just in case someone wants a really
defined dark lip um I could do that for
them so this kit had three different lip
liners in it I do have a lip liner in
the color fawn and I really like that
color and formula so I thought I would
give these a try
this first color here is in the color
nude it also came with the color Ruby
which is a nice red right there it
almost has like a pinky undertone if you
were to like share it out the last one
is called Cheyenne T its CH Insp I
interesting name and it's a really nice
purpley plum color thought that was a
nice variety again it's nice to have lip
liners I don't know why that's just
something I like wanna have a million of
em I ain't kit and last was another
little set this is the love me do kit
and it had two minis I believe these are
minis of the lemme do lip crayons this
one is in the color fig and it's the
more natural of the two these are the
perfect type of lip colors a for my kit
especially when I'm doing things that
require people to look really natural
and not super made up it has a nice like
Sheen to it it's more glossy and it's
like a medium opacity I'll definitely
give the lips color but it's not gonna
look too made-up those are the colors I
appreciate the most same with this one
although it looks deep and dark in the
tube it has more of this like glossy
natural look to it I find that these
colors just look so good on the lips and
again if you're in a close-up or
something it just doesn't look like
straight-up like lip product the
translucency of it really reads well to
me I like it a lot so whoa that's
everything that I picked up I'm really
happy with mostly everything that I got
except for that one little thing I will
let you know in the description box once
I call them and get that figured out how
that all went but overall I just highly
suggest checking out her products
especially if you're just wanting to try
something new or if you are someone who
likes a little bit more of like the
natural look I think that these products
are going to be really great
they have great ingredients it's a great
company and they perform really well and
they're still really luxurious and easy
to use so anyway that's everything I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
I have a few I have some more video
ideas for the series coming up soon
hopefully I did have a comment on my
last video about doing some like Korean
beauty brands or doing some or doing
some beauty brands that are more
all-natural or sold at Whole Foods or
sprouts or even like Trader Joe's or
just something like that so I will be
working on that as well
that all being said I hope you guys have
a great rest of your day I will see you
in my next video and that's everything
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
