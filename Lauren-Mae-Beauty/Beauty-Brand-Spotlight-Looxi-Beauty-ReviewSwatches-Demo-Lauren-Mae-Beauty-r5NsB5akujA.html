that's Lauren thanks so much for
watching today is gonna be another
beauty brand spotlight I haven't done
one of these in a while
this is a series that I started to talk
about brands that don't get enough love
that you don't care a lot of reviews on
they're not the mainstream brands that
you can get in Sephora or Ulta
I just wanted to place on my channel to
feature those brands talk about them
give honest reviews not every single
video is necessarily a straight-up
review video sometimes it's like a haul
of something you haven't seen a lot of I
don't know I just really wanted to place
on my channel I love indie brands and
something I always find that's lacking
with bigger youtubers are just diversity
of products they get sent a lot of
product which is awesome but you know
I'd like to see other stuff I'm
interested I love makeup and I want to
see other brands so that's what I try to
do with this before we get started I
want to mention this is the same day as
like other videos I've done obviously my
makeups insane but I had to stop filming
kissed and at home and I just had a
break in between and that white shirt I
felt salsa on I when I was eating chips
and salsa so we're back to black we're
back to black yeah I'm not trying to
like pull it over around guys it's the
same day kinda like redid my hair and
hopefully my makeup still it's okay
because it's been all day anyway so
today's brand is a looksie beauty and
this is an indie brand that specializes
in eyeshadows and highlighters that's
everything is on a side it's just a
shadow and highlighters in these videos
I like to give you a little rundown of
what I can on the brand so I have some
notes here I'll read off for you guys
look see was started in June of 2015 so
it's about two years old now this is
created by a woman named Jessica D and
the reason an inspiration behind her
brand was that she wanted to invent
trends and not follow them another
driving force behind the brand is just
having unique colors and creating makeup
from a makeup lovers perspective instead
of just by labs nothing is private label
it's all 100% cruelty free and another
thing she prides herself on is great
customer service
and a great customer shopping experience
which I can 100% attest to that
and then last circle more like specific
details if you're going to be on a site
and you're in the US
shipping is $2.99 which is super
reasonable and cheap and then you get
free shipping over $35 I really love
that I know it sucks for people who are
international I don't know what
the shipping is on that but for people
in the u.s. that's an awesome shipping
rate I'm really happy about that
silver highlighters you can buy three
separate types of highlighters they're
either a pan only a pan and a compact or
I think a bigger size in a compact I
believe so for the Jets the pan it's 750
for the pan and the compact is 12 and
then for the bigger size I believe is
1650 I'm not sure about sizes I don't
have any of the highlighters to show you
guys today and then for eyeshadows all
of her eyeshadows are $5 and she has a
ton of different finishes she has mask
she is really awesome duochrome that's
what brought me to this I'm going to
link all of the social media links down
below for let's see so like the site
also instagrams because that is what
sucked me into this the pictures of
their eyeshadows on Instagram are like
banging in it um they have some really
awesome do Chrome's and I was so
intrigued then to see that the price is
only $5 was like absolutely amazing any
guys know I like order to ordered I just
I'm going to go a go ham and like go
all-in
I don't like test the waters and you're
like five eyeshadows I get like sixty so
that's all the information I really have
these are the shadows that I purchased
so I feel that the whole Z palette here
and that's what they look like super
pretty I love this color and spa going
on I love that there is some neutral but
also some really fun pops of color the
look I have today is going to be at the
end there's a demo I will also do just
like a run-through of swatches for you
guys as well and then I didn't have
enough room in the other palette so
there's just three little loners in here
I have had these shadows for quite a
while I really wanted to give you guys a
good review I was expecting to just
automatically love these fall in love
just be sold basically be stopping
website buying everything and it's not
quite the case so it's kind of like a
complicated review I feel like so I
really wanted to take my time really
feel out the shadows get an idea of how
they works on the eye after multiple
uses how they compared to other shadows
yeah and just give you the most honest
best thought-out review that I cut
so we'll just get into it I do overall
really like these shadows I think the
price point is really good I think the
quality is really nice they're all very
pigmented I
have a few issues if you're looking for
shadows that are going to be soft and
velvety to the touch and they're just
going to feel like you know you could
sleep on them they're heaven these are
about them they have a definitely dry
feel to them I don't find that that is
any issue though when it comes to
blending or pigmentation especially with
the mask
they're very pigmented they blend out
very nicely you can see this is the
eyelid I created and all the other eye
lists I've done some have been wonderful
super pigmented so that just kind of
like throws me off like they look great
but just the texture of them throws me
off when I swatch them with my fingers
and then back to the dryness I'm mostly
talking about the mattes here but
because they're so dry and not chalky
because they don't perform chalky they
tend to break so as you can see in the
swatches once we get to those you will
see that some of these pants have like
breaks in them
and that is not because I've done
anything to them it's just because
they're very dry and very fragile I
would never travel with this palette it
would just turn into like literally dust
um because they are very very fragile I
shadowed specifically I had issues in
shipping with one shadow these two brown
shades in my first initial order both
came totally cracked so I sent them a
message and email sent them a picture
they gladly replace them for me so they
sent me two replacements one of them was
fine the other one was broken and I was
like what the Freak you know in the
second package I got with the
replacements the packaging was like
extra padded I mean they definitely took
care to make sure that these weren't
going to get broken again so one of the
shadows was good to go the other shadow
truffle was still broken so I was like
hey I know you guys took a lot of care I
appreciate it but this one is still
broken and Jessica D herself emailed me
back and was like I'm so sorry about
that
she refunded me for that shadow and then
she sent out a replacement had that
shadow as well so that was really
awesome like the customer service was
amazing she's like it's not your fault
I'm so sorry about that so I really love
that and I love everything about the
brand but that still leaves my taste in
my mouth and now
and I get truffle and it still I mean
this one of the least shattered out of
everything but it just is so do you see
that it's cracked you'll see Ternes
watches its it cracked to because it's I
think the formulas just so dry it's very
very fragile and just is so prone to
cracking even without you doing anything
it's kind of like a time bomb waiting to
go so that is something I just oh why I
just wish that they had a little bit
more of a creamy texture not even just
for like the sense of feeling them with
my fingers because that doesn't matter
swatches on the hands don't matter it's
how it performs on the eye but I do
think that part of the dryness that you
feel with your finger lends itself to
being easily cracked and turning into
dust and that really sucks because I
want to use it these are awesome shades
I want to use them on the eye and I hate
seeing a bunch of like cracked eyeshadow
pans so wasted product it gets
everything dirty and it's just that's
not how the products of these other than
those things so I do really like the
matte I think very nice it's it's kind
of just down the middle it's what do you
want to deal with that do you want to
risk it it's up to you guys
it still is only five dollars it's not
like I'm paying twenty dollars of shadow
I definitely will still use what I have
I like them all using the tutorials but
those are kind of my thoughts on the
mask now getting down to these colors
here these are all shimmery duochrome
like really foiled shades I also have
one in this palette here this gray one
like I mentioned they have so many
different duochrome again if you're on
their Instagram you will see all the
different cool swatches like it was hard
to narrow it down to this money now once
again with these I like them but it's
like everything's like I really like
them but I just want to let you guys
know what you're going to get into like
if you order these what to actually
expect they're all very beautiful I
think that these Watts really pretty but
they definitely need to be patted on
with a finger in fingers watches they
look great this is the color noir look
at the shine on that it's so pretty
but it's just kind of like a sinner
formula you're definitely not getting
like a really mu C kind of like a makeup
geek foiled or the make up forevers
shadows how they feel kind of like
ethically and like heavy on the finger
means you not feel like that they are
very very thin I find this a work best
if you use your finger to apply them or
a tacky base or bowls like if you do
both you're definitely going to get a
good product if you just try to go in
with a brush you're going to get just
more like a flaky look it's just not
going to look nearly like the swatches
that you see online and you'll be
definitely disappointed but other than
that they're super blinding super pretty
I don't find that there's that much like
glitter at any of these which I really
appreciate like look how shiny that is
it's crazy so I do suggest them honestly
again with the price these are only five
dollars where makeup geek foils are
getting up to ten dollars and other
brands obviously that are more expensive
are going to be more expensive so I love
that the five dollar price point still
stays true for these more glittery
shimmery shades I just wish once again
that they had a little bit more like
moisture almost to them or like a
binding agent of some sort so that they
were a bit creamier and could perform
better without so much finessing that's
just a little my opinion if I had to
suggest one formula over the other I
don't even know I like them both evenly
for different reasons but I think the
most unique would be the Aurora's which
are kind of like their dual chrome and
the shimmery shades they are very very
beautiful I kind of think that's it for
the review portion of this I hope you're
going to understand anything again I'm
not saying that you won't like these I'm
going to leave below some different
reviews I know that they do an affiliate
program it's very small it's nothing
like morphine and I believe that it is
like the affiliate code does earn the
person a commission I do not have one of
those I bought all this with my own
money so some of the videos that I saw
and a lot of the times the posts that I
see are people with those affiliate
codes not that that means anything I'm
just throwing that out there but I will
leave other videos that I love death of
their swatches and you can see their
reviews and kind of get a feel I watched
Brianna Fox she is a youtuber a leaper
video went down below I just bought all
of these and I think they were still
being shipped to me and she put in her
favorite and misses video for months how
she did not like the shadows she thought
they were the worst ever
crappy and so that really freaks me out
and I do not agree that there's that bad
like they're not I don't think that
they're bad I just think that they're
definitely their own formula and they're
definitely you're definitely not getting
like makeup geek and you're not getting
color pop it's just it's just different
you know this Jessica Dee's formula and
I think that you can get the swatches
that you see on people's hands I think
you can get the looks on people's eyes
that you see on their Instagram I
definitely just think it takes a little
bit more finessing than you'd expect
when you just you know see those that is
everything so if you guys want to see
the swatches stay tuned and then after
that will be the demo of this I love I
hope you guys enjoyed this review let me
know if you've tried look-see yourself I
would love to know and what your
thoughts are and that's everything if
you have any other brands that you want
me to review or look into definitely let
me know down below I know I have one
other video coming up in this series
hopefully soon once I try it out a
little bit more for skincare and I'm
really excited for that so onto swatches
on to the demo
Oh
I
Oh
Oh
me
yeah
No
you
we are going to move on to the demo
portion of this I obviously have nothing
on my face you've already done my
foundation and my brows I've already put
primer on my lids if you want to know
how I did this face
I will leave that video linked down
below when it's up if this one's up or
that one's at first I don't know hundred
percent know what I want to do today I
kind of want to use this blue I don't
know why I've been feeling Blues lately
but I have and I'm going to go with it
because usually I'm a pink and purple
girl or really warm tones so I'm still
using warm tones but you know I'm going
to go into this shade here this is the
color sorbet and I'm going to be using
this as my transition this is very
similar to orange soda it has a very
nice orange look to it and it definitely
pulls up orange I feel like it looks a
lot more orange on the skin than it does
in the pan which I don't mind I like
that I think in my Sigma e-40 you guys
know I love this brush to just get a
nice light transition going these do
kick up a bit of product and they're
kind of dry so you will see when I go in
with the lid color I'm going to be using
like a sticky base just to make sure I
get the best color payoff and probably
also beneath my fingers that isn't
anything new for me I do that a lot with
shadows but it's just something to
mention which I'm sure I've mentioned
already in the other part of this with
you all right I'm liking the way that
looks so I'm going to be moving on I'm
going to keep using this brush and I'm
going to be moving into this color here
I believe this is called honey buns and
I'm good yes honey buns and I'm going to
be keeping this to the outer portion of
the eye and a little bit lower than
where we blended sorbet so we can keep
that nice transition that we worked on
alright I'm going to go back in with
sorbet and just kind of sweep over
everything to make sure you have a nice
blend and then kind of messy with it I
have hooded eye so I tend to like to
bring shadow up a little bit higher so
that way when my eyes are open you can
still see shadow now I'm going to go in
with this color here this is the color
pumpkin spice life it's very yellow and
I'm going to just lightly put that more
on the inner portion here
I just want it to be a little fun and
I'm bringing it into the brow a bit but
I just love that yellow kind of look up
in my brow and that's always good for
putting and we're not putting it on this
portion at all and I just flick it even
like into my briar
I like the way that's looking I'm gonna
go in with the lid color I'm going to be
using this shade here this is the color
noir it's a really pretty cool toned
blue it's almost like a periwinkle level
it's super shiny so I'm going to be
before I do that I am going to put a
face down just to try to get the best
pigmentation I can so I'm going to go in
with this Rimmel scandaleyes this is in
the color bulletproof beige and I'm just
going to put that down and I'm going to
do one eye at a time just so that way
it's the most sticky when I apply the
base that way the most sticky when I
apply the eyeshadow and I'm just going
in with my finger on top of that shadow
and pressing it
okay that looks really good I'm going to
do that to the other eye I'm really
liking the way that looks so I'm going
to go in now with my color pop blending
brush and we're going to start working
on the outer portion I'm going to go on
with this color here this is the color
Faro
and I'm just going to start blending
that into the outer corner and I'm just
going to start warming up and deepening
up that outer shape
so now I'm going to go back in with a
mix of honey buns and sorbet and just
kind of blend Oh Sara I'm also going to
take this small little brush and take
honey buns and go in right on this
corner and just make sure it's blended
I'm also going to go back in with my
finger and just kind of Pat on more of
the blue colors so that way we have the
most pigmentation on the inner corner
and it kind of fades out I really like
the way that turned out I'm super happy
I'm now going to go on with this like
bright pink shade and put this on my
brow bone hopefully it looks okay I'm
just lightly doing that I have the
tiniest amount of fallout like barely
anything but I'm going to take my brush
and some powder and just kind of sweep
it away for the inner corner I'm going
to keep it kind of ethereal I'm going to
go in with this shade here this is
called lime light I love the shade I
used it as an inner corner all the time
I also use it on my face all the time
super pretty and it's just going to add
a little something something more to
this look it's like has a really pretty
almost like lime green and mint shift at
the same time I'm going to tightline
with Max Costa reach and I'm going to
put some white on my waterline and I'll
be back for the lower lash line I'm
going to start by just buffing a lot of
sorbet which is upside down but sorbet
all on the bottom lashline kind of
roughly I get end up putting a little
bit of Costa reach on the bottom and
then blended it out I'm now going to go
in with Honeybuns and do the same thing
but just a little bit closer and again I
like to keep the darker color to the
outside so not going in quite as far and
then last Italian the kind of red shade
I'm going to go in with Faro and I'm
just going to keep that on the very
outer half and last I'm going to go in
with some mascara so I'm going to put
that on and also put a lip color on and
I will be back to show you the final
look okay guys so this is the final look
I hope you enjoyed my lips to have a
little bit of NARS rakubian nothing too
much I wanted to make sure
I came out wait because it ordered some
colourpop lip glosses as well as their
new palette and I can't wait together
the mail because I just don't like
opaque lip colors like I don't like them
anyway I think that looks really good
I'm really happy with how it turned out
I've never used noir before and it looks
really cool I'm happy with it
so then thank you so much for watching
and I will see you guys in my next video
