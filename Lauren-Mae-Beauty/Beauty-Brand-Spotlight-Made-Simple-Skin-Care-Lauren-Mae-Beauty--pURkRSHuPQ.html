Lauren thank you so much for watching um
you've a very natural look going on
today um no but we are talking about
natural skincare today add a couple
videos wanted to film and this is the
look that I came up with and I don't
care this is what I'm wearing and I hope
you guys don't hate it that's kind of
like the goalie can you don't hate it
off and we're good anyway this video is
going to be another beauty brand
spotlight this is a series that I do on
my channel to focus on brands that maybe
aren't as well known and they don't get
as much love and just kind of bringing
attention to them in whatever way as he
said this is going to be a review of the
brand made simple skincare I was
contacted by Julianne who I believe is
the owner of the company and she wanted
to send out some products to me these
are natural non-gmo organic raw skin
care products and I just was really
drawn to that I was excited to give him
a shot see how they worked on my skin I
have been texting these products out a
good two months and I definitely have
some opinions on them something that I
really love about Julianne is that she
just gets it she was such a great person
to talk to I told her up front that I'm
going to review your products good or
bad and she thought it was great that I
was honest with my subscribers she also
totally gets that the skin care line
isn't going to be for everyone and
that's just something I really respected
her saying and I also think that the
brand is just doing so many amazing
things so although I did not love
everything I really do like the brand
and I definitely overall suggest it for
you guys to check out if this is
something you think you would like
anyway I'm going to talk a little bit
more about the brand before we get into
product timestamps will be listed down
below as well as the playlist for this
series if you want to check out some
other unknown brands so how many notes
here but made simple skincare is an
organic skincare line that does raw
vegan and food grade skincare products
and by raw that means that none of the
ingredients in the skincare products are
heated to over a hundred degrees
Fahrenheit so everything is still has
the nutrients and
in tact and isn't overheated these also
have no water or filler ingredients in
them so all of the oils are just 100%
pure so they're not going to go bad and
spoil which is nice and then last kind
of that I wanted to hit on is that
everything is made in small batches in
handmade so you know these aren't going
to be these huge batch numbers and then
they're going to sent out this is a
small homemade little business and they
are bringing people natural skincare
something else that I really liked about
the brand was the prices I believe one
of the most expensive items is like
forty two dollars for a serum and I
guess that that is a bit pricey but for
being homemade small batches all natural
like high quality ingredients I really
feel like that is such a great price
there are so many other products out on
the market especially when it comes to
skincare and especially when it comes to
things like serums that are so much more
expensive so I love that they are
keeping an affordable price range for
the quality that you're getting I think
that's everything that I want to talk
about with the brand at this moment I'm
going to go into reviews and then at the
end I'm going to go into things that
Julian wants to do to kind of expand the
brand new ideas that she has and I think
that would be kind of fun to talk about
so I'm going to start off with my
favorite things and then move into the
things that didn't really work out for
me so let's just get into it
my favorite products that she sent me
which I have seven different things she
was very generous are the face serums my
absolute favorite one is the one in the
sensitive skin range which is a row tip
and chamomile this smells really really
nice it just has a really natural like
herbal scent to it this is just such a
nice product I really feel like it's
helped my skin and I'm not an oil person
so it was very surprising to me that I
actually liked this once I got these
products I was like oh crap they're all
oils I didn't really I don't know why I
didn't realize I just thought it was
going to be more like moisturizers but
most of these products are oil-based but
I still love this despite the fact that
I don't really like oils to smell
everything about this is just such a
nice night routine for me I really do
think that it helps hydrate my skin my
skin is in a really good place right now
and I do think that a lot of it is
because
this I do really like it so out of all
of the stuff that I've tried this is the
number one product that I recommend the
other serum that I have here is the
pumpkin and juniper this is for oily
skin and this one still smells okay it's
not as good as the other one it just
kind of smells like grass and dirt
almost I just fresh you know but like
earth fresh but I feel like it I think
this still works really nice this has
more of like a green color to it whereas
this one is like a bright yellow I do
like this I will definitely continue to
use it use it up but if I were to
repurchase I would definitely get the
row tip one I'm going to continue on
with skincare because I do have some
oral care products and I'll talk about
this after so the parts I liked next
when it came to the skincare line was
the face toner in the orange blossom and
bergamot this is for oily skin and again
it's in the glass bottle it has the pump
I love toners and spray char's I love
that it's in this form but for me the
break the deal breaker on this was the
smell it's not the worst but for me it's
also look like orange and tamales like I
know that's so weird but that's kind of
the vibe I get from it like something
about as I kind of corn I don't know if
that's the bergamont so it's just not a
good smell to me and it's hard to use
it's not so bad that I wouldn't be able
to use this whole thing up but if I have
spent my money on it for me personally I
wouldn't love it but I also I didn't
realize how finicky it was the smells
until I was trying these products
because some of them again just aren't
my favorite smell and I'm not at the
place right now where it's worth it to
me to use something that I just take the
smell of I needed to be a better
experience at night when I'm getting
ready and again I love the smell of this
one so it's all about taste and
preference and what you smell and what
you like because this smells so good and
I love the routine of this at night with
this smell but this one is looks like I
feel stressed out using it because I
don't like to smell other than that
toner wise I think it's a nice toner I
wish it was a bit bigger this is a 2
ounce bottle but the price on this is
$15 so it's not like
in the $30.00 range or anything I just
think it would be nice to have a bigger
bottle of this you could have it at home
and not run through it as fast I have
two more skincare products to talk about
next I want to talk about the mask this
is this bit ruling a tense
face mask I think this may be how you
say it not really sure it's really hard
for me and this is actually a dry powder
map I've never used a mask like that
before so I was really excited to try it
out that is what it looks like and I'm
going to insert a picture of me wearing
this because this turns like really kind
of like this bright dark green when you
add the water to it which is really
interesting it almost looks like like I
don't know like velvet Moss that's what
I think of every time I use it the smell
on this isn't overpowering anything bad
I kind of like it it smells just like
nice and natural and fresh
I do find this a bit hard to smooth on
to the skin so it's not like you're
going to add the water and this becomes
a creamy texture that when you then put
it on the skin you can get a nice even
coat it kind of is a little splotchy and
whatever which is fine it's just
definitely know that going in this dries
down kind of hard and the feeling on
this face is kind of like a clay mask
that's the best thing I can compare it
to it's going to feel just yet kind of
like dry and tight and then you wash it
off it's a bit hard to get off I felt
like I really have to scrub kind of like
a clay mask again I didn't find that
this did that many amazing things for my
skin personally I felt like it had
definitely like exfoliating properties
and my skin did feel smooth but it
definitely wasn't a mask that I felt
like oh my gosh I definitely can see the
difference I just really didn't see any
of that I also feel like because of the
way this tightens on my skin and how
hard I have to rub to get it off I was
totally my skin was a little irritated
and that kind of sucked it's like the
benefits in that way how irritated I
felt like my skin was so I personally
didn't like this I really wanted to like
this one too this was like the thing
that started it all because I really in
the mask and I was so excited to try
this but it just didn't quite work out
for
and last for skincare is something that
I wasn't even able to use I tried using
this once and the smell of it to me I
just couldn't even do it this is the
chamomile in Palmer Rosa a face wash oil
so again I'm not someone who usually
uses oils but this would be a great
product to like remove your makeup or
anything like that because those oils
are going to be able to break down the
product I just was not able to do with
this smell the smell on this for me
personally is just too much to handle
and not worth it so yeah I can't even
give you a review I'm sorry I wish I
could I just couldn't do it that's just
me again some people might not have any
problems with that smell and be like
what are you talking about you're crazy
everyone has different like olfactory
bulbs but um for me it was just too much
and I was doing in shower and I just was
like oh my gosh wash it off immediately
I thought I'd mentioned really fast too
I did save all the boxes I've had these
boxes in my house for like two months I
just wanted to show you that they do
come in boxes they're really nicely
printed I mean as much as this is a
smaller company it's like a homegrown
business it's also like nice they have
nice packaging they're printed I mean
it's still legit if that makes sense
anyway I just wanted to bring that up
I thought the packaging was cute I like
that they did it like color themed by
like type for sensitive skin or oily
skin or whatnot next we're going to get
into the oral care products that I was
sent these are their number one best
seller on the website so I was really
excited to try these out the first one
I'm going to talk about is the tooth and
gum tonic this isn't a flavor experiment
clove it's the only one that they have
and this retails for I believe $10 yes
$10 this too is an oil and the
instructions on this are to spray six to
eight pumps into your mouth then you
take this to the water and you just kind
of swish it around for a minute or two
and then you spit it out the whole idea
of this is definitely rooted in oil
pulling if you haven't heard about oil
pulling I will leave a video link down
below as well as an article link down
below if you want to check it out my mom
did oil pulling for a while and she
absolutely loved it she felt like it
really did get rid of a lot of the
toxins her bad breath her teeth were
whiter again check out those videos if
you want to know more but I really
did like this product it's just a weird
of the texture you're like getting used
to it but overall I do think that it
worked really well and if you're looking
for something that's oil pulling or
something like that this is a great kind
of alternative it's not going to be as
intense as putting coconut oil in your
mouth and swishing around for 20 minutes
but the thing that I love the most about
this is when I eat salsa I don't know
what it is but the garlic or the onion
or something but I cannot get rid of
salsa breath no matter what I do and
every time I use this I really feel like
I can get rid of that like stink out of
the back of my throat even when I brush
my teeth I scrub my tongue I you know
use even like Listerine I still have the
taste of salt in my mouth it's crazy but
I did feel like this really helped it
and almost got rid of it entirely I will
definitely be finishing up the rest of
this I almost wish that this one's just
spearmint though the clove in it is
definitely a different taste and I think
they go well together but just for a
personal preference I think it would be
great for it to just be spearmint and I
also want to set you up for what this is
going to be like because although it
says spearmint and clove it's not going
to be sweet at all
there's no sweetness to it it just has
this like faint spearmint taste once you
spit it out I feel like is when you can
kind of feel it the most in your mouth
so just be prepared for that it's not
going to be like your classic mouth
washes and last I have the toothpaste
here now this is what be toothpaste
usually comes in this is the made simple
toothpaste in the mint sweet orange this
is not sweet but it doesn't only have
the flavor of more of a sweet mint like
gum than a spearmint or peppermint if
that makes sense so you're not going to
get any sugar taste but it's a sweet
mint and it's not a Harshman anyway this
is what it comes like and this is I
believe coconut oil let me check here
yeah unrefined virgin coconut oil sesame
oil coconut so oilmen experiment
peppermint sweet orange
certified organic non-gmo this will melt
at a certain temperature and so if it's
like 70 degrees or over it's going to
melt so when I got it it was like liquid
and it's
on the top to put it into the fridge so
I did that but it really was still kind
of liquidy and so I like this product
I think it's fine and dandy I think the
two of them worked really nice together
I don't know if I'd repurchase it but I
definitely would finish using them up
and would enjoy using them but the
packaging on this is like the biggest
downfall for me it's just so messy
especially when it's liquid I don't like
that it's there's not like an easy way
to dispense the products onto my
toothbrush and like I said at the
beginning since there is no water on
these products you could just dip your
toothbrush in and it shouldn't breed any
bacteria and you know shouldn't spoil in
any way but I just personally don't like
that like I don't know it just kind of
grosses me out to do that so I did
decide to decant mine into this which is
just a plastic bottle which is kind of
defeating the purpose of all the glass
but this is just an easier way for me it
just has a little top and I can kind of
just like put a little bit on my
toothbrush shake it up and use it that
way so those are kind of my opinions on
the oral care and the different products
that I tried out the oral care is
definitely really affordable the
toothpaste is $10 the tonic is 12 for
all natural ingredients I think those
are pretty good they come in glass
packaging like there aren't any like
corners cut which i think is nice I hope
these reviews helped you at all if you
are interested in his brand or if you
are interested in more natural skincare
I want to take a look at this brand I
wanted to take the end of this video
really fast to talk about something that
Julian wants to do for the company
and do for the brands in the future I'm
going to leave all of the links down
below for the website as well as their
Instagram and I'm also going to leave
Julian's email so that way if you have
any ideas or if you do decide to order
and have ideas or want to you know reach
out you guys can do that I know she'd
love to hear from you if you have any
opinions on how she could make these
things happen first since all the
products are in glass it's often because
they're easy to recycle but she wants to
start a send back program kind of like
back to Mac but it would just be a way
to reuse the products which i think is
really awesome and it just shows you
that this brand isn't about just getting
the money for being like organic or
sending the money for saying
they're rough they really are wanting to
do things that are good for the
environment that are good for your skin
and good for the earth I just really
like that another thing that they want
to do is start a sampled Club so people
who purchase a certain amount of money
throughout the year can kind of get
first dibs on sampled and they can get
feedback on the product and kind of have
a really good dialogue between the
customers and the company which i think
is really cool as well and then last
Julia is working on a way to donate a
portion of the proceeds that they make
to certain charities which i think is so
cool once again I just feel like this is
such a community-based thing I just love
that it's about more than just being a
business she just gives me so many good
vibes I love it let me look at my email
that she sent me this would be called a
gift bag program and they want to pick a
small progressive charity choosing about
accepting nominations from the customers
in the area of plastic pollution
criminal justice reform and the arts she
has the master's in theatre which i
think is so cool sam got his degree in
theatre and we're all about the arts
were all about the creative and I think
it's just so cool I'm also very much
into criminal justice reform I think
that is a I'm very passionate about that
so so much of it is just like a yes to
me and then they could either donate
directly or the customer can elect to be
included in a pool anyway I don't want
to get too technical at the end here but
I just wanted to bring those up but
these are things that she's working on
implementing into her company and I
think that is so cool and if you have
any ideas or you've bought from them
before and you didn't know this and just
want to like talk it out or help them
out or whatever you want to do I will
leave all that information down below I
think this video is long enough just
kind of took a long time I really wish I
would have liked more of the products
and that more than would be a Holy Grail
but I'm still glad that I do like the
face serum and I'm really glad that I
could try these products out and if
anything bring awareness for people that
really would like this brand that this
would be a great fit for them and it's
something that they're looking for and
they don't see on the market near them
or in Ulta or Sephora or any of the big
chain stores that is everything thank
you so much for watching guys and I will
see you in my next video
