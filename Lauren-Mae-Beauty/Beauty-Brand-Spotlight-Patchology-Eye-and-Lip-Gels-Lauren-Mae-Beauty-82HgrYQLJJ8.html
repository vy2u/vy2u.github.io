Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be another episode of beauty
brand spotlight and today I'm going to
be featuring Pathology petrology
you guessed it is a brand that focuses
on different types of patches so they
have like eye gel lips gels they also do
face masks they have some foot stuff
kind of very specific but I'm really
excited to talk about this with you guys
today this was sent to me from pathology
through optilead you guys have heard me
talk about Oesterle a million times if
you want to check it out I'll leave the
link down below I want to talk about the
company a little bit before we get into
reviews so let's get into it
obviously since the name of the brand is
tetralogy they're very heavily
influenced by the idea of having like
skin care packages essentially and
they're kind of mission statement is
skin care that delivers at the speed of
you so the entire idea behind this brand
is to create a product that's going to
get you the skincare benefits that you
want from a product but in a very fast
way they first develop their patches to
be used in the medical field and since
then they've continued to develop things
for skincare so the two products that I
have here the eye patches and the lip
patches these are each supposed to be
used for five minutes so that is
something I absolutely love about this
again they're keeping true what they're
kind of like quick skin care philosophy
you only need to have these on for five
minutes to get the benefit and you can
move on with your life which is awesome
for me because honestly I don't put a
ton of time into my skincare routine and
I really do like being better it's like
faster easy I also wanted to mention
that these products are latex free and
biodegradable and I wanted to mention
just that friend here that when it comes
to the status of cruelty free logical
harmony it's still pending so I kind of
like they're not it looks all over the
website I couldn't find it so if that
changes or if I find anything out
different I will leave a link in the
description box yeah that's kind of all
I have on the brand there wasn't a lot
about them on the about me page on their
website so let's just get into the
review I think I'm going to first start
off with the IMS so these are the
pathology slash pack idols and they come
a-knockin
like this another thing besides
something only five minutes which is
great
these have 30 pairs in here now if you
buy a gel often then you know that's a
lot of pairs because usually you can get
about I want to say 8 to 10 in a pack
and the price might be a little bit
cheaper these do cost $50 but you get 30
pairs so that breaks down we've done a
little math for us that breaks down to a
dollar 66 a pair yeah I like I just like
right now with like wait is that right
but yeah that's crazy right a dollar 66
a pair so if you're scared away by the
price it's understandable when you look
at it but if you break this down you
really are getting a great value
especially if you want this to be a
bigger part of your skincare routine
these patches are supposed to reduce
puffiness fatigue and drying it and they
use caffeine and hydrolyzed collagen to
do that I use these quite a few times
that has Sam use them I've used them on
Katie one of my makeup clients I've had
my mom use am I brought them with me to
Arizona so I feel like I have a pretty
good idea of how I feel about these I
love them I can feel really awesome I
will have a clip floating around at Mia
finally so you can see what they look
like and how I put them on these feels
super cooling on the skin they're just
so refreshing and again you just have to
leave them on for five minutes they
definitely stay on well for five minutes
I have even worn them a little bit
longer I just kind of wear them as long
as I watch you and then just rip them
off I just love that it's that simple
these are very well saturated in the
pack I'm going to open it up so you guys
can see it does have like a little thing
on it like this in my cap I got stuck
but they do have a little tool that they
have in each pack so that you can get
out see gels sanitary which I really
appreciate because I do use these in my
kit so I don't put my fingers in them
and that's what it looks like inside so
they fit in really cute and everything
something that doesn't mean really
anything but I think it's kind of cute
these have like a glitter or shimmer
suspended in the jelly matrix of the
iMac so they just look kind of pretty
and I just think that's like a nice
little touch I don't know if that does
anything for you I just like it overall
I really like these I highly suggest
them I can see myself for purchasing
these to keep in my kit because I really
like offering something like this
to my clients it's just something a
little bit extra a little bit special
and honestly I do find that anyone who
has some you know puffiness or maybe
dryer eyes
these patches can really help to just
give you a better canvas to work on I
guess I have a few cons Oh one I do find
that when I put this on the eye I like
to kind of remove the liquid afterward
if I'm going to be going on with makeup
because one of the times I use is my
primer did not sit well with it to a
kind of balled up so if you're going to
try it with your primer and moisturizer
and make sure it works just be aware of
that or remove it and then move on with
your skincare and makeup steps
another thing is these are very thin and
I personally don't mind it but something
to just keep in mind is that these can
rip pretty easily just be gentle with
them try not to really move them around
too much once they're on your face you
can like position them where you need to
inside them but they are a bit fragile
nothing too fragile but just something
to keep in mind
they aren't insanely sturdy because you
do get thirty of them in here fit is
great then you can see that in my demo
and the last kind of I guess cotton to
me I just wish the shape bombings was
slightly different as you can tell
they're meant to fit into this container
so they are kind of like a yin and the
yang type of situation and I find that
that makes them kind of dig down a bit
more instead of being a little bit more
flat against the eye I wish that they
just kind of were a little bit more oval
instead of circular so you could get
them even closer under the eye here I'm
still think they work super well and I
have gotten these pretty close to my eye
and a little bit of the juice or serum I
can do what the heck a little bit of the
serum did get in my eye and it didn't
burn or anything so it's not like a huge
problem I still think they're great it's
just more like if I was making these
masks that's something I would change so
overall with these I highly suggest them
and back to pricing I thought I would
just mention I did do a little bit of
research some of the most popular brands
or just more well-known ones that I
could find skinned Iceland has eight
pairs for $30
Karuna has I masks four pairs for $36
and then chlorine has seven pairs for 24
that one is the most reasonable out of
the three
I mentioned and even that one if you
were to double it is these fifty dollars
for 14 pairs and you're going to be
getting over double the pairs for that
price in this one so to me when I first
saw that these are fifty dollars a piece
I was just like that is so expensive but
when you really break it down and you
see how many pairs are getting it's a
great value and I like it because you
can kind of use them how they're meant
to be used like when you need to pick me
up when you you know we're feeling a
little tired that's what I personally
like to use them the most for when you
just want to feel a little refresh
you're watching TV and maybe and I just
aren't feeling that great I don't know I
love just that cooling sensation I
definitely feel like it does helps with
puffiness it does help with dryness and
I really do feel like revitalized after
using them I use them right before this
video to show you guys the demos and it
was a very nice pampering experience and
let's talk about the lift map these are
the flash patch lift gels and these only
have 24 in them at the post to the 30
but these still cost fifty dollars out
of the two I feel like this is the one
that is the most extra like you don't
need this in your routine but I
definitely feel like it is fun it's
pampering now for claims on this this is
supposed to help moisturize soften and
prep the llege as well as diminish
vertical lines so that's kind of crazy
this is using peptides and green tea
extract to help do those things now I'll
show you guys what it looks like inside
super cute right this is like you know
all your Instagram dreams coming true
right here these are tinted pink and
again they have that shimmer suspended
in it which i think is just so cute as
you can see from my demo they have a bit
of a slit in it so you can like open
around slightly honestly I don't feel
like that really helps that much but I
did have to kind of move it around a
little bit once you find though your
right positioning it feels very secure
on the lips it sucks down on all sides
for me which I thought was really
awesome and again it has that really
cool and refreshing feeling like I said
this isn't something that I think
everyone will need or want but for me in
my kit this is another thing that's just
extra step to give someone that extra
pampering feeling so I really like this
and again I want to have these in my kit
I've tried to lick masks a couple
different ways one with nothing on
little wipes and when you take off the
lip mask after five minutes if there's
any serum you're supposed to just kind
of like tap it into the lips and then
let it soak in when I did that and I
didn't have any products on my lips it
did feel a bit tacky and I didn't
personally enjoy that feeling so just
keep that in mind try different ways I
did try it with just a tiny bit of lip
balm underneath it and I really liked
the way back felt I really felt like it
walked in that lip balm it helps just
moisturize overall and when I took them
off I didn't feel that same stickiness I
didn't feel like I needed to rinse my
mouth in any way I personally will
probably do it that way just like with a
little bit of lip balm and putting the
mask on so as for helping plump vertical
lines I don't have vertical lines in my
lips and I've used these on Katy again
she doesn't have them either so I didn't
see any improvement or change with that
but I do think that in all the other
ways smoothing and hydrating and
prepping the lips I do think it is a
good first step not needed but it's a
nice step I think it does work to help
give you a better canvas to work on when
it comes to your lips those patches are
the same as the eye patches in thickness
so again with that split in the middle
of lip ones are easier to rip so just be
careful it's nothing we're like oh
you're ripping them over and over it's
just something I want to warn you guys
about just to be careful so that way
you're not wasting your money I did
break these down in price to for you
guys it's 24 patches for fifty dollars
which comes up to two dollars and eight
cents per patch and I did go ahead and
find some other skin care brands that
offer lip patches - so you guys can get
an idea for the skin Iceland you get two
patches for $15 for Sephora you get one
patch for $3 the closest I found there's
the Tony moly one where you get a patch
for $4 so if you want to kind of see if
flip patches are your thing maybe you
could go with one of those but I know
that patch ology also does individual
packs so if you just want to try a
couple packs you don't want to invest
fifty dollars in the full one you can
just try a couple of them
and you know see if there's something
that would work in your routine that's
basically everything I'm going to leave
tautology link down below if you want to
check them out while I was browsing the
site and looking at the different things
they offer and checking out what their
company's about on the screen and
popping up for 15% off so if you're
going to buy definitely make sure you're
getting at least 15% off from their site
I'm not affiliated with that at all guys
I'm just giving you a helpful little tip
that I saw while I was looking at the
website just if you're going to go for
it try to save some money on it and
that's it guys I hope you enjoy I really
do like this brand and these two things
specifically I think work really well I
love that they're super fast and easy
and I'm excited to use them in my own
skincare routine but also keep them in
my kit that's what I'm honestly most
excited for I think they're a great way
to offer my clients some really nice
pampering that's going to be fast and
effective
thanks so much for watching I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
