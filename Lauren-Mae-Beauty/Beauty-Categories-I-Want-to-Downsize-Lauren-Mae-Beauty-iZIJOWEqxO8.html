a wonderful day I'm so sorry if you're
tired of seeing this face I promise this
is the last video I'm going to film
today I was going to wait but I'm having
a very busy week next week so that's why
I filmed so much I just have so much
with school and then every single day
other than that I have like I'm working
outside of school doing makeup looks I'm
Adam doing my makeup look and then I'm
going to be working on a set so yeah i
just thought i'd rather have consistent
videos for you coming up the next couple
of weeks and i'll just film so hopefully
you guys are okay with that this video
is going to be kind of my goals in
categories to downsize this isn't even
making sense already but i want to
downsize some categories in my
collection other than makeup i just put
up a makeup inventory i'll leave that
link down below and in that video i
decided that i didn't want to put a goal
on my collection for makeup because it's
kind of always going to be growing and
constricting and as i use things up and
depending on what I'm into or what the
trends are it's just going to be kind of
moving around and it's like a living
thing so I didn't want to give myself
goals and then feel guilty if I didn't
hit those goals or whatever my goal is
just to keep track of my collection and
for the most part downsize it where I
can and where I feel comfortable but
that video got me thinking and I love
makeup and that's why I'm okay with
having a ton of makeup because I love it
I I don't feel ashamed I feel happy I
feel just joy when I see my collection
for makeup and although I'm again
working on getting it down it's just
something I love but I have a lot of
other stuff in a lot of other categories
that I don't feel that same passion for
and so I do want to downsize those areas
I haven't set goals for myself but I
decided to kind of inventory those items
and I just want to kind of check up on
myself throughout the year maybe four
times this year and see where I'm at and
just keep downsizing those collections I
don't need them as large I don't want to
keep them as large or sustain them to
keep them as big as they are so this
video is just a way for
kind of pinpoint those items that I
don't want to have a lot of and
hopefully since i'm making this video
actually stay on track with it this is
my paper i decided to write it on and it
just says categories to downsize I kind
of took curious sparkles or Maggie here
on YouTube I took her a little like box
method because I thought it'd be really
fulfilling to like check those boxes off
so first category body scrubs currently
I have five body scrubs and I don't
really need that many at a time it takes
about three weeks to a month to really
go through a body scrub for me if I'm
using it every time I'm in the shower so
that's like five months worth of body
scrubs and I don't need that many so I'd
like to keep that always at like two or
three if there's a deal on something
like buy two get one free then obviously
I'd have three but I really don't want
any more than that so I guess I'm kind
of having goals uh so I guess I'm kind
of putting just like very loose goals
that I'm just speaking to you about but
I don't really want more than three body
scrubs at a time with one being in
current use shower gels that's the next
category I have a lot of shower gels I
have 27 currently to let you guys know I
am counting like mini sizes and things
as normal just like I do in my makeup
collection as well so just if it's an
item it counts as one it doesn't count
as less than something because it's tiny
anyway shower gels I have 27 that's
absolutely insane I don't need more than
like three at a time so I'm working on
it bath products now these are anything
from like lush bath bombs to bath salts
to a bubble bath or anything like that I
have six products currently and I really
just want to have like one at a time
maybe two I don't take baths like I used
to so there's really just no reason for
me to have them hand soaps I can't wash
my hands any more than we already do
here but I did have an insane stash of
hand soaps for a really long time I have
since worked through that I haven't
bought any hand soaps all last year I
didn't find any hands up to 2015 and i
still have 11 left yeah i still have 11
left so i just want to work on those and
i don't really want to have more than
five at
I buy my hand soaps from Bath and Body
Works and usually they'll have the deal
five for eighteen dollars so I'm okay
with buying them like five at a time
like that but I really don't need to buy
more than that because by the time I
finished those five up the seasons have
changed and I want to try the new ones
that are out so I think it'll just be
more fun for me to only have five at a
time so i can constantly be getting new
sense and not feeling like i have to use
up these old sense that because i bought
you know 20 at one time hand cream these
i'm only counting things that are actual
hand creams and i still have 11 so hand
creams need who move out i love hand
creams and they feel so nice but 11 is
obsessive so i am trying to work on
those body lotions I have 16 body
lotions i will say that a lot of those
are small sizes so if I really work on
them this year I do think I'm sorry
about that place if I really do work on
them this year I think that I will be
able to really condense down my
collection quite a bit this year and I
don't want more than like one lotion at
a time I'm not a lotion person I don't
like lotion I want to have one cuz if my
legs are actually or I need it I need I
want to have it but I do not want to
have back stock at all body sprays I
have a lot of body sprays from Bath and
Body Works I don't think I want any
maybe one and travel size but i don't
use body sprays I just think they smell
cheap they smell good but they just I'd
rather and I feel better wearing a nice
perfume than I do a body splash so I'd
rather save all the money I've ever
spent on bodies frozen by one really
nice perfume so currently I have 12 body
sprays in big sizes little sizes all
together I have 12 and I want to just
work on that as much as possible
perfumes i also have a lot of perfumes i
have done a really great job in 2015 to
downsize my collection of perfume and
work on things but I kind of recount in
my collection and counted it differently
than i ever have before so oh my gosh
it's like a demonstration outside
planes so for perfumes I decided to
count all my roller balls any size
roller ball and then anything that has a
spray on it so I didn't count any of my
tiny little vials I kind of just collect
those because I'm a collector at heart
and then any of the ones that are like a
you know you pull out and you have to
like drop on you I didn't count any of
those either as perfumes in my
collection because again i kind of just
collect those i don't i don't intend on
using them so with my roller balls
counted up in any of my spray perfumes
counted up I have 28 perfumes and that's
a lot of perfumes I think I can go
through and declutter a couple of them
because I was counting them in a
different area it's kind of a long story
but I think you can to clutter some of
them and then the other ones they just
really need to work on using up this
year huh I think 12 of them are roller
balls alone and various sizes so i
definitely want to work on that so that
way i can really just have a really
edited version of my perfumes because
right now i'm trying to use them up and
i hate the feeling like if I'm going
somewhere like on a job or something I
don't want to wear that perfume because
I want I don't want people think that's
what I like to smell like and I don't
want any of my perfumes to be in that
situation if that makes sense two more
categories the next category is candles
right now I have 23 candles in all sizes
and I really want to just you know only
have like seven candles at a time 23 is
a lot but I even had more than this I
haven't bought candles in a while I
bought one for Christmas and that's it I
haven't I just have stopped going in the
bath and body works really and I really
want to work through my candles this
year and then just have a group of like
seven at a time I it takes a long time
to burn a candle up if you're bringing
it every single day for a couple hours a
day it would still take you at least a
couple weeks if not like a month and if
you had seven candles at seven months
worth of candles and that's plenty to
have on hand at one get
helmut last is skincare i decided to
count up all my skincare items I am NOT
super big on skincare only because
personally spending money on skincare
right now is just not something that I
personally like I also have a lot of
skincare currently because I did work at
a beauty store and we got a lot of
gratis so I have a lot of just like many
sizes and full sizes of a lot of random
things so I just counted everything
together serums and moisturizers and
masks and everything I'll count of
skincare and I have I have 47 items
currently because a lot of those are
minis I'm hoping I can really focus and
get those items out either by declutter
Anor using them with the skin care
category I just want to decrease what I
have because I know a lot of it is
clutter and not stuff that's like part
of my everyday Holy Grail routine so I
just kind of want to put this on the
list so that it can really focus on
using up some things before I go and
just purchase new things i hope this
video made sense it's a little bit
different but this is just me being
accountable to someone to kind of get
these categories down and i really
wanted to write these down on paper so
that throughout the year i could really
see my progress and feel happy and know
that i did actually use things up
because i've noticed that even with the
makeup i used up in 2015 if I didn't
save all those makeup empties I would
not have believed how much makeup I've
used up so it's just kind of a way for
me to see that progress visually and
keep myself motivated in those
categories to use items up I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I promise
I'm done for today so i will see you
next time in a different outfit and hair
and on a different day so i will see you
then bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
