Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a video all about
beauty products that I get really
excited about there are a couple of
products specifically I'm gonna mention
that inspired this video because I was
like Lauren you were getting way too
excited about this that's weird
and you're weird I just thought it would
be fun to talk about some things that
don't normally get talked about a ton or
I don't know I'm just I'm excited about
these products these are things when I
see them on trend mood or on Instagram
or there are new releases that I get
like excited about for weird reasons I
don't even really know why these things
really call to me and I'm not gonna be
talking about basically any makeup
products these are just like other
beauty products because basically I'll
make up I'm pretty excited about and I
don't think that's a weird anyways let's
just get into the five products that I
have here and in the comments I would
love to know what products you get
weirdly excited about that maybe no one
else does you think you're kind of like
it's strange that you're that excited
but you are I would love to know them oh
my gosh see I get the ring I'm so pissed
why does that happen can we get a
scientific study as to why that happens
I'd love to know I'm really sorry if
it's been in like all my past videos
that's so disgusting I'm so sorry anyway
back to this video the first thing I
want to talk about our hand soaps if
you've been with my channel for a while
you guys know that I'm like really into
hand soaps I really mostly love the
bathroom Body Works ones so I brought
out a couple different scents to show
you guys so the first one here is French
balsam this is a Christmas scent or
holiday scent but I like it all year
round
I just love balsam the candle smells
great I love that like Christmas tree
scent but it doesn't have any like
cinnamon in it so this is a great one
this is in the foaming hand soap
I like the foaming hand soap but I find
it goes a lot faster than the regular
hand soap so yeah I kind of pick and
choose I buy some of the regular I buy
some of the foam I just kind of go back
and forth another scent that I have is
lavender and birch this one smells
really nice it's in like a limited
edition cool kind of packaging I bought
most of my soaps that I have currently
where they were all like 250 each every
hand soap in the whole store and then on
top of that I had a 10 off at $30 coupon
it was like crazy good so I highly
suggest if you're gonna be doing bath
and Bodyworks to wait for good sales and
kind of stock up
I like to make sure I don't stock up on
the same seasoned scent that that's the
season we're actually in because you
won't be able to get through all those
by the time you get to summer and you'll
want summer scents and they'll go buy
some and then you have a stockpile and I
like having a lot of soaps on hand
because we have a kitchen in the
bathroom and we go through about one a
month but yeah you don't want to too
many this is one of my all-time favorite
scents ever
this is marshmallow pumpkin latte and
this is some kind of weird packaging but
this is a great smell love this
definitely not my normal scent profile
this one's really sweet it smells kind
of like I don't know not not like a
pumpkin latte to me at all it's just
like a bakery kind of scent but it
smells so good oh this just gives me
memories because it's like it'll be the
third year that I use it next October I
only have two more to talk about but hey
you were warned we're gonna be talking
about some beauty products that you know
why is anyone this excited so the next
one is bergamont waters and this is a
really nice scent as well I have this in
a candle too and I really like a clean
kind of unisex scent if you can't tell
that is something I really like I also
like Apple scents and like a fig sense I
like citrus scents clean things and then
last year this one is an exfoliating
hand soap and this is again from Bath
and Body Works it's in the ice blue sage
it was just in my favorites video and I
love this I love that it exfoli it works
really nicely I didn't know how this
would work with it pumping through and
if it would be too rough for every time
you wash your hands cuz I feel like I
watched my hands quite a lot but it
works really nice I find that my hands
are softer they're not irritated it's
kind of like a refreshing moment in the
bathroom and I really love it so with
this video I thought I would talk about
the things that I have things that I
used to have that I really loved but
maybe I've used up and things that I
want to purchase and I'm excited for so
the soap that I really really want to
try is from Aesop it's like $39 it's
insanely expensive I was on set and in
the bathroom it was just in a house but
in the bathroom they had an esop hand
wash and again it was exfoliating so one
I'm like super excited for that and the
scent was just kind of herbal I know it
was just
nice and just it felt nice using it and
I don't love to spend my money on a lot
of luxurious things but something that
I've realized and I'm coming to terms
with that sometimes even if you spent a
lot of money on it it's like you
treasure that that product more you
enjoy it more it brings more fulfillment
to your life not everything is like that
not every product is like that but some
of these like higher-end Beauty things
it's like I'd rather have one of those
in 700 bath and Bodyworks ones so I mean
I don't know if that's true but I'm just
saying sometimes that can be the case
and it's like worth it then to spend
that money like in the end you're happy
you did it anyway I'm not saying
everyone should buy a $40 soap because
it's kind of ridiculous but that is
something I really want to try when it
comes to hand soaps next product that
I've recently been getting weirdly
excited about our facial mist and
setting sprays I don't think I was
really a setting spray girl I know this
has been a thing for a while and
everyone's been spraying their face down
with the Tasha setting spray and all
that stuff but for me I just never
really got into it it was just something
that I couldn't just get into the habit
of adding to my routine and lately I
have been which is been really exciting
so I thought I would show you the
different ones that I have because I
only have like four at the moment but
I'm excited to get some other ones I'll
talk about makeup setting sprays first
this one is from kiss and it's the pro
touch makeup setting spray
I enjoy this I think it's okay but I
really like the scent experience of
these and this one doesn't have a nice
scent so it's kind of just like whatever
I also find that I'm not necessarily a
huge fan of like mattifying setting
sprays I don't necessarily want it to
mattify my skin I don't really like the
look of a setting spray that mattifies
the skin I'd rather have it just kind of
make my powders not look so powdery
that's like what I'm looking for and
again that scent and just feeling
experienced so this one's okay would not
purchase don't necessarily recommend it
this one from Milani I do like
definitely more than this this is the
make it last setting spray I don't find
that this makes my skin matte really in
any way it's very fast going it's about
ten dollars I really enjoy the smell of
this so that's a plus the sprayer is
nice although I've talked about this
before but my sprayer is I think messed
up so I would be willing to give this
another chance with another
one though because I'm pretty sure it's
just this defective one not how all the
sprayers are but those are the two
specifically makeup setting sprays and
then the other two that I have are more
you can use them for more purposes they
aren't necessarily for makeup
this one's from Saturday skin I'm almost
done with it I have about a quarter of
it left and this is the daily do
hydrating essence mist I've been using
this kind of as a toner after I cleanse
my face and before I put on moisturizer
also whenever I get out of the shower I
think this is nice but again I wish
there was a scent aspect to this or just
something it just doesn't smell nice
it's not like a bad scent but it doesn't
smell good at all either I don't
necessarily need it to be super fragrant
I feel like it's making it like I'm
spraying perfume on my face I just want
it to be nice and this doesn't
necessarily have that so it's just okay
I haven't never said anything amazing
but it's not bad and then my all-time
favorite out of all of these is the mac
fix+ which I've talked about in like
every video I filmed the last week so
love this would repurchase have your
purchased it's a great setting spray and
just everything it foils eyeshadows and
this is the only one out of all of these
products that I do think foils eye
shadow as well these ones don't really
do anything it's just like wetting it
with water this one actually does
something to make it more metallic so
highly suggest mac fix+
next we're going to talk about hand
creams because I got a lot of them these
ones all are from Crabtree and Evelyn
and I bought them all in a set so if I
can find that set I will leave it linked
down below if you're interested in it
I'm not gonna read these all off by name
because it's really way too many but
I've used up two of them and I think it
came with 16 it was like four times four
yeah I believe it came with 16 of these
mini hand creams which I love the mini
hand creams because it's enough to try
it know if you like it and if you want
to repurchase it but if you want to try
different scents or different ones you
can kind of move on fast and I don't
know I feel like the values there for
everyone so I really do like this
formula of hand cream they called them
they're ultra moisturizing hand
therapies they're great I think they
have some really unique cents and
something that I love about these ones
as well as the lots of tan ones which I
will get into in a second they just have
a nice light refreshing scent it's
nothing overpowering sometimes with
something like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works those
scents can just be so artificial and
just so invasive and just like
aggressive and these ones are definitely
a bit lighter if you're used about the
body work sense you might be like these
don't even smell but as your olfactory
bulb gets used to something a little bit
more subtle you can really pick up the
differences of this and I've just really
been enjoying these so I can't wait to
just try these out it's something really
fun I'm just way too into hand creams
that's the only brand to have at the
moment some brands have tried in the
past that I've really really enjoyed I
love the co de lis hand and nail cream i
think is what it's called has a very
nice light refreshing scent again very
similar to this it's a French brand so
it's not super perfumey smelling it just
feels great on the hands it's very
moisturizing it feels nourishing I love
that one it's great I don't even think
it's too too expensive anything it's
right around the $15 mark L'Occitane
also has some great hand creams they
have like two different types of
formulas they have their 20% shea butter
one which i think is really really nice
that's something that I like to use in
winter or at nighttime if you're someone
who has really dry hands that's the one
I would go for it's just a lot thicker
it's more moisturizing it just is going
to do the job for you better but if you
don't want something too heavy or
moisturizing I would go
not that formula I know they have a rose
hand cream that's a lot lighter and that
one's really great for everyday when
you're at your desk or when you're at
work or whatever it is and you don't
need greasy hands that one sinks into
the skin really fast especially if you
don't use too much of it and can you
know nourish your hands without it's
just getting all over your keyboard or
whatever you're doing I think it's
really funny because I really don't like
lotions but I love hand creams it's so
strange so anyway some hand creams that
I do want to try out I really want to
get the curly one again
but I really really want to try out the
sol de janeiro one I love Sol de Janeiro
products I think they're really great
they're expensive but I don't know
there's something about them I'm just in
love with so they just came out with a
hand cream and I cannot wait to try it
it's on my makeup wish list which I'll
be doing a video on soon and I cannot
wait I cannot wait to try that one out I
think the smell is gonna be amazing it's
definitely gonna be very potent but I
think it'll be fun that's the one I
think on my wish list the most oh and
you know another one I really want to
try scent bird scent bird has like hand
creams now and I really want to try the
scent for hand cream the scents look
really interesting I like the packaging
everything about it I'm really into so I
want to try those too let's get into the
products that inspired this whole video
and those are world care products
specifically floss yes
floss was the inspiration for this video
these are flosses from cocoa floss I
believe you can get these at Sephora but
I did get mine sent to me from octoly
and when these came on the website I was
so excited to try them I love the
colored packaging like everything about
this brand aesthetically is something
I'm totally drawn to and I find that a
lot of oral care brands on Instagram and
stuff have this like really slim sleek
cool girl aesthetic that I just like I
want that floss I want that tooth polish
anyway I really wanted to try these out
because they had some interesting
flavors I have fresh coconut I have
delicious mint and then I also have cara
cara orange and I've really been
enjoying these these are more robust
floss than I'm used to using I love my
dollar store breech floss that is what I
use all the time I usually go through
about
one of those a month with me and my
husband we really like to floss I can't
imagine not flossing seriously if you
don't floss I'm not judging you but I
definitely suggest flossing it's really
good for your gums it feels really good
to get gunk out of your teeth and once
you start doing it like you cannot go
back and if it hurts just keep doing it
because your gums aren't healthy and you
need to kind of like yeah work on it I'm
telling you just please floss so out of
all of those three scents my favorite
one is the fresh coconut it smells
really great it smells really great just
from the bottle which I know is just
like a silly thing but there's something
about it it's like a scent experience
because you are putting it so close to
your nose which I love um you don't
taste anything that was something I was
worried about because with the orange
scent after like brushing your teeth I
was like oh I'm gonna put the orange on
and then it's going to be weird at the
mint but you don't taste really any of
the flavors this one is definitely the
most potent along with the mint but it's
just kind of like a fun thing I don't
know I really enjoyed it I liked the
design of the container it's
ergonomically to my hand again I was
saying this is kind of a robust flawless
and it's a little bit thicker than I'm
used to which has been kind of nice I've
been enjoying it all of these have
coconut oil as well which is like a
really nice ingredient for the mouth so
yeah I've really been enjoying it I
really like them I think these retail
for eight dollars each though so it's
definitely a steeper price than what I'm
used to paying for a floss but if you
need maybe an extra push to use floss
and maybe having something fun like it
smelling like coconuts or something
would make you get into the habit it
might be worth it to you because you
only get one set of teeth y'all and the
other oral product that I wanted to talk
about is quit now I also got this sent
to me from oculi because again I saw
this on the site and I was like I really
want to try that out and it's just a
toothbrush I have mine in the travelpod
and this is how it comes to you I've
been using this for I think almost three
months now because this is the
toothpaste and it's gone so this isn't
like I just got it this is like a legit
review because I've been using this for
a really long time I've been traveling
with this yeah I traveled to Arizona
with this during Thanksgiving and then
for Christmas and then to Vegas I
brought it so I'll talk about the
toothpaste
I love the toothpaste on my
I'm pretty picky when it comes to
toothpaste for whatever reason and I
really like this one so this is
something I would repurchase I'm gonna
get one of these for Sam like I'm gonna
purchase one for Sam because it's a
great little electronic toothbrush I
love it so much how this goes you can
either have this in the stand and just
have it on your counter like that or you
can take this off and like close this up
so that way when you travel you have it
but there's a little thing on the back
you could put this straight onto your
mirror or really like shiny surface it
doesn't work on like a regular wall just
so you know and this isn't something
looks like sticky it's like a suction
cup which is great so even though I have
it off now and I'm touching it I'm not
like ruining it it's not like a one time
you place it and you can't place it
somewhere else which I love also this is
like the cutest toothbrush ever I love
this one I have mine in the copper and
this is kind of like a subscription
service or at least you can do it that
way where you get a new head sent to you
every three months and you can get
toothpaste sent to you as well if you
want it's an electronic toothbrush so it
vibrates and then it also will like
pulse every 30 seconds so you can move
it around your mouth for a full two
minutes
it's just I'm excited to brush my teeth
with this and I've just really enjoyed
it I think that it gets my teeth cleaner
then when I use a regular toothbrush
really enjoyed it and this has me so
I've been on Instagram and I've been
looking at a lot of different brands and
I'm so excited to try other oral care
brands I'm gonna leave some like
screenshots of things cuz anytime I get
sponsored like a sponsored ad but it's
for makeup or for oral Karen it seems
like something I might like I will go to
the page and then I'll screenshot the
page for later and I really want to do a
series where I try out like Instagram
brand makeup and I'm not talking about
like popular Instagram brand makeup
basically just make up I was introduced
to or beauty products I was introduced
to because of either ads on Instagram or
however I found it and things that
aren't really talked about but anyway so
I saved those screen shots and there are
a lot of oral care brands probably
because I keep clicking on these ads but
there are a lot of
one's out there I've heard that quip is
the best and I will say I'm very very
happy with this but I kind of want to
try a couple other ones just to see
which one I like the best so I don't
know if you would ever be interested in
a video comparing them let me know the
biggest thing I love about this and I
know and we're going on and on about
this toothbrush is that it comes in this
pod so when I travel
it's so nice guys it's so sanitary and I
just I love how easy it is it's like oh
let me get my thing put it in let's go
we're traveling if you are someone who
wants to take your toothbrush with you
to work or whatever it is you could have
one in your work bag or whatever I just
really like it I only think it's a great
system it's just so good it's so good
guys and the last category of things
that I get weirdly excited about our lip
balms and lip scrubs I am NOT someone
who likes liquid lips I don't even
really like putting on too many lip
products in general I'm mostly a lip
balm girl and now kind of a gloss girl
so lip balms get me so excited I love
seeing new releases I want to try like
every lip balm ever i I just love them I
would have a lip balm collection way
sooner than I would a lipstick
collection I thought I would talk about
some of my favorites that I have
currently these haven't been talked
about for a while on my channel and
these are from Revlon these are the
Revlon kiss lip balms I have the flavor
juicy peach and they also have the
tropical coconut I do have an apple one
but I never use it and it's tinted red
so I tend not to reach for it so I
really only wanted to show you the
shades I love these are so great I love
them a lot
I can't wait to bust these out I need to
bust them out I think the caps were kind
of coming off in my purse which my purse
is a crazy vortex of disaster so it's
not even necessarily fault of this it's
just like chaos in my purse so that's
why I took them out and I haven't been
using them but these are really nice
they're pretty affordable I mean all the
drugstore stuff is kind of expensive now
I believe these are about ten nine ten
dollars but I do think they're worth it
I think they're nice a lip balm that I
like to use in my kit and I think is
really good this is from Jack Black I
have the lemon one here but I have the
mint one the shea butter one and I think
I have like a cherry black cherry one I
like these because they're in a squeeze
tube so they're very sanitary
I also like that these don't make your
lips overly glossy so I can use them on
men and it's not going to look like a
lipgloss on camera or anything so I
highly suggest these lip balms if you
have a guy in your life who needs one or
if you want something that's
low-maintenance and you like a squeeze
tube this is a great formula just beware
that the mint does tend to tingle some
things that I've liked in the past and
probably my all-time favorite lip balm I
know I have a lot I love the fresh sugar
lip balms it's probably my all-time
favorite I gave those out to basically
all the girls in the family this year I
think I gave out three or four of those
to people for Christmas so I loved that
one just the regular one not the
treatment just the regular original lip
balm it has a lemon scent it's amazing
it's expensive I think they're up to 26
dollars now that used to be 2250 and now
they're $26 but honestly they're one of
those products that they hurt to buy it
first but you're so happy you have them
Sam loves it too he's like when we're
buying them for Christmas he was like
can I get one like wait wait are we
getting one so that one's definitely a
really great lip balm I also love the
nooks lip balm it lasts forever it's not
too expensive the shelf life on it is
kind of short though it's like six
months so that one's good though I do
really like it it's a great one for
night time okay and now onto some lip
balms I really want to try the biggest
one I wanted transfer Moroccan oil which
I love the brand Moroccan oil and it's a
lip balm it was on Sephora it sold out
in like two seconds so that's something
I'm like I really want to try that lip
balm so bad and then I think there's
like some hydrating mask lip mask I know
I've heard Emily Noelle talk about it
it's like a pink tub I think it's from
pur Lisse I don't know that is something
I really want to try though whatever she
was talking about it might be a lineage
though I don't know which one that one
looks interesting I'm interested and
then when it comes to lip scrubs I have
one here I only have one in my personal
collection this is from ELF and it's in
the mint scent I'm not going to show you
this thing because it's disgusting
because I use it a lot and I like to use
this when I am done doing my full things
to make up and I'm about to put my lip
on I like to scrub my lips get all the
like Foundation and gunk and just prep
them for my lip product I don't like
applying a lip
/ foundation it just gets gunky and I
find that you're gonna get the ring ten
times worse than you would otherwise so
this is really great $3 and they have a
ton of different scent or flavor options
so this is a great affordable one I also
really love the lush sugar scrub that
one's really nice as well it's in a pot
and I like to even lick that one off my
lips like this one I don't like licking
off it's just kind of weird to me but
that one for whatever reason I just you
can easily look that one off if you want
a little treat alright guys and that is
everything for my weird beauty products
if you have any suggestions of things
that you love in these categories please
leave them in the comments I would love
to know them and I would love to know if
you are weird about any of these
products too if you have like a weird
fascination or love these are just
things that get me really excited and I
don't know why like why hand so why
floss it's something that goes in
between your teeth anyway that is
everything I know this is a long video
so if you're here thank you so much for
watching guys and I will see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
