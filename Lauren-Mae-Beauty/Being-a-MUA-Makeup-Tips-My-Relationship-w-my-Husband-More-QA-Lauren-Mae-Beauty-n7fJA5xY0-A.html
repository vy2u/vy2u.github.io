Lauren thank you so much for watching it
today I'm gonna be doing a QA oh I'm
super excited to be doing this I asked
in a couple different videos it was like
it get ready with me and then another
kind of like my creative process video
and I asked you guys if you had any
questions if you wanted me to do a QA to
leave any there and I got quite a few
questions so this might be a long video
so it's just gonna be fun or me chatting
or gonna be talking a lot of the
questions we're even about my hair me
and Samms our relationship and also
about me as a makeup artist so a lot of
the questions are gonna be back but
there are other questions in between
there and I have them all on this list I
printed them all out I like went through
the comments and I put everyone's name
and the comment so I'm gonna try to save
them ones name if I butcher it I'm so so
sorry
I'm trying we all know this about me
yeah so I definitely suggest that like
you're doing laundry while you do this
or you're doing something maybe and
you're just like listening or you're
like eating food or like that's
definitely what this video is gonna be
I'm gonna try my best to answer all
these questions we'll see how long that
actually takes but other than that we'll
stop the intro let's just get into the
first question so the first question
comes from Alex Payton and I believe
it's a couple different questions it
says since you live in LA have you had
any notable celebrity encounters how did
you and Sam meet there's a lot ok there
were a lot of questions on this so we'll
just go one by one so I do live in LA if
you guys didn't know and I have had a
few celebrity encounters when I used to
work at my Beauty job in West Hollywood
a lot of different people would come in
there it's like in LA I'm telling you
right now like you see celebrities quite
often I feel like we live in an area
where we're really close to studios and
different things and so it it happens
like you go to the grocery store I saw
the I don't know if this guy's a
celebrity but I saw the catch me outside
girl I saw her at the grocery store me
and Sam Sam's actually the one that was
like hey isn't that her and I was like
yeah that's like let's stay away
I don't want an altercation today but
when I worked at the beauty store I had
Sharon Osbourne come in and she was like
shopping around I've met Sarah Paulson I
rang her up she's super awesome so sweet
so nice I love her actually she would
come in quite often
and then Janice Dickinson came in one
time she was like looking for pasties
and stuff so yeah I have had a few not a
ton
I'd like someone who gets kind of
weirded out by celebrity sightings like
cuz in my head I'm like I know they're
celebrities but they're also just people
and so like I am the opposite of like
other people wanting to get pictures I'm
like avoid oh boy like get away so yeah
I just like don't ever want to be too
weird the next question was how did you
and Sam meet me and Sam we met in high
school we've been together since I was
15 years old and my first boyfriend my
first love yeah we met in high school so
there are more questions so I'll just
I'll leave it there because we'll
probably get into more next was talking
about like a patchy eye shadow so when
you find that your eye shadows turn
patchy what do you do to try to fix it
and for me I think fixing a patchy eye
shadow usually that means I'll just have
to go darker like depending on what's
going on just trying to add opacity to
that also if it's like something on the
outer edge you can use instead of going
darker use like a light cream shade to
kind of buff shadow and try to fix it
that way I also think trying to play
around with the amount of pressure
you're putting on your brush or how
you're applying it in that way will help
make it less patchy or more patchy
depending on the eyeshadow and the
formula and all of that I mean
definitely be using a primer and if you
have to sometimes you can stipple just
in the one area you need it and then
kind of like Pat and barely blend that
out yeah I try to miss patchy you just
do your best to try to like eliminate as
much patch as possible and I feel like
pressure and just adding more product to
specific areas is the best way to do
that I think to over blended can
sometimes happen and then things are
getting bad so just like sometimes you
have to just know when to leave it and
then the last question she had was what
makeup artist related goals do you have
and honestly I don't have a ton of goals
when it comes to being a makeup artist I
went to makeup school but the reason I
went to makeup school was to know more
about the industry to make connections
here in LA and we had just moved here I
think we had lived here a month before I
started going to makeup school and I
always knew like my goal is I'm always
someone who wanted to have my own
business when I was younger
to open like a thirst shop like a
secondhand store that was like my bowl
all through high school like I was like
I'm gonna have a secondhand shop it's
gonna be so cool and so as I fell in
love with makeup I decided that I wanna
have my own makeup line so that is my
ultimate goal in my career is to have my
own line and have products and I
definitely think that's going to happen
in the future but I just don't know when
but that's my ultimate goal so as a
makeup artist long-term I don't have a
ton of goals but I guess individually
for each like set and client in
situation I just want to do the best job
I can with the time I've given and I
really like to just make sure that I'm
the best person I can be on set and I'm
like you know being the best aide I can
to talent in any way that is whether
it's actually with makeup or helping
them get water like in that way or just
emotionally - before they go on and have
to do with that to do so yeah hopefully
that answered your questions
next is doo de Ville poto hopefully I
said that right her question was if you
had to choose between never eating
popcorn or never eating ice cream which
one would you choose I would probably
give up popcorn ice cream is just so
good gelato 2 is so good and as much as
I love popcorn especially if you're like
going to a movie I could give it up I
would take ice cream Elizabeth Klein
Crammer said how long have you had your
pink hair have you considered dying in a
different color
I've been pink now for probably like two
years it's been a long time it's super
weird I'm just so used to it but like we
were at the show last night and I was
like well am I the only one with pink
hair in here like I'm so used to it and
I realized like oh yeah it is really
weird that my hair is like bright pink I
love it and I honestly don't see myself
switching anytime soon you guys can
probably tell that I go from like a
darker pink to a lighter pink depending
on how often I'm using my shampoo but
yeah other than that I still love love
the spectrum of pink I have had my hair
purple though before if you go really
far back on my extra gram you can see me
with purple hair and I do like that like
ashy purple that lavender super
beautiful the only thing is it just
makes my hair darker and I just didn't
it's weird to see me with dark hair I
just I'd rather have something light and
bright like the pink then I would
something darker and pastel like the
lavender so
yeah I also like the pink cuz it's a
little bit warmer whereas the purple is
more ashy and cool and I'm just like
with my skin tone and everything I just
like the pink better next is a question
from Mia Tejeda I think that's how you
say it has a J in it but I'm assuming it
makes an H down hopefully that's right
great look will you talk about the
upkeep of your hair how often do you
redo it and what do you do to keep it
looking fresh things love your channel
your two cups are quite
thought-provoking oh thank you so much
so my hair definitely I feel like I'm
lucky I do have quite light hair
naturally this is like my natural hair
color I definitely don't have to do as
much as someone who has super dark hair
to get it light and then be able to diet
the pink my mom's a hairdresser so
whenever I go home to see her or she's
in town she always dives my hair and
that's how I get like the lighter colour
and you can see like my roots grow out
my videos go you can see it's like it's
time to get my hair done so that's what
I do to like lighten it so that my hair
can actually take the color because the
lighter your base color is the more the
actual color of whatever you're putting
on is gonna show up and then ask for
like the actual color when I'm with my
mom she'll actually use like a dye we've
been using the fram easy bold color in
bold pink or something lately and I
really enjoy that but for actual upkeep
every day and like throughout the times
when I go and see my mom I use a color
shampoo so I'm gonna leave a picture
here I'll leave a link down below I
suggested so much it's amazing the one I
use is hot pink it's from viral celeb
EULEX whatever I don't know the names
like super long but it makes it so easy
to dye my hair and keep it up the color
I want I usually will go like every
third time I wash my hair or second time
I washed my hair depending on how pink I
want it and I let that kind of sit in my
hair I will warn you now the hot pink
one dusty in your hand so I like to work
really fast with it I try to kind of get
it off my hands as fast as possible but
it will leave a tiny bit of a stain but
I'll put it on this part of my hair and
I'll put on this part of my hair and
I'll let it sit while I wash my body and
do whatever else I'm gonna do and then
I'll wash it out and that's just been
like the easiest way for me to upkeep it
and I really enjoy it I've gone through
probably three or four bottles of it
it's great next repent a buga ball she
said what are your Holy Grail beauty and
makeup products it's kind of hard to
talk about like
your holy girl products there's so many
of them that I really do enjoy and I
don't know I have a tack video I just
did with like if I could only choose one
I'm gonna like link back down below so
you can see everything but just to give
you guys some answers I love the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD I think that one's
really great for me for my kid it's just
amazing I love the shade ring I also
love that Milani concealer it's just so
good I don't know what it is about it
it's great I've been really liking the
benefit roller lash mascara lately but I
have the mini size and who knows but I
love that where the perversion those
have been like my two favorites lately
and then probably my ELF brow pencil I
think those are the things that I would
like 100% recommend to anyone like if
they were like hey what do you use or
what should I use those of you my first
go-to answers next from NAT tea the
question she has is she's super
fair-skinned and it's really hard to
find makeup techniques and looks that
look good on her skin do I have any tips
tricks hacks for wearing makeup as a
ghostly pale person she mostly just
wants to know what kind of colors are
gonna look best and compliment her skin
tone the most and I think my biggest tip
for people with super pale skin is one
be aware of undertone because it's super
important like it's gonna show up the
most on you and also almost like always
going really really light color is very
relative if you're putting something on
a really light skin tone it's going to
show up so so much more so if you're
going for a bronzer making sure it has
more neutral tones nothing too orange
nothing too yellow and I honestly don't
think anything too gray I know gray for
contouring is important and if you're
doing like that really chiseled look yes
but sometimes that can look a little bit
gray too so I think just finding
something more neutral and using a
really light hand having good brushes
that are gonna blend and not leave
things to patchy I think that's really
important I also really love cream
contouring if you're having a problem
with like let's say bronze are not
blending out I love the milk make up
stick I think that it just melts into
the skin so well and when you put that
on you put your foundation and then you
use that I if you blend it in with a
brush I'm telling you it's like seamless
and it just looks so good so I think
just yeah going as light as possible and
being aware of those undertones because
on fair skin the orange is going to pop
out where someone with the medium skin
tone can handle that color and that
duration I hope that helps you don't
have specific products but hopefully
depending on your preferences - that
helps a little bit hopefully next
question is from Katrina Liz on and it
said do you ever run into any of your
subscribers how does it feel when that
happens I actually have met subscribers
twice so I met a subscriber once where I
was just like out in back she like
recognized me which was like so weird it
was very exciting it's super awesome but
I just it's I'm awkward and it's it
feels weird that someone like knows
about you and knows who you are and it's
just like oh I don't know it makes
everything that I do here not that this
isn't real but like I'm here in my
living room right now talking to a
camera and then you know obviously you
have subscribers and you have views and
all this stuff but it just makes it so
much more real when you meet someone
who's like I watch you and I like your
videos and then it's like it's just a
crazy feeling it's so weird it's it's
very odd and then I've also got a
subscriber because she actually
contacted me to do her makeup for her
demo reel which is really really cool
and a good time so yeah not a ton of
instances which I'm kind of okay with
not that I don't want to meet you guys
I just I definitely need to work on on
that and just be like oh hey and excited
and like not like oh I'm weird oh I'm
sorry you know yeah next question is
from Miss Ashley C and said what's the
best way to start working color into
your eyeshadow I have some really fun
colors and palettes but I never use them
because I'm afraid of looking like a
clown you do such great looks with
bright colors and I don't know what the
best way to get comfortable with them is
maybe I have to dye my hair pink so then
I can just match them you can definitely
do that
I suggest like if anyone ever mentions
dyeing their pink I'm like yes do it
you'll love it you'll never regret it
hair is just hair like if you want to
die in here I get that people can't in
certain situations depending on your job
like I understand that but I would never
want to live with the regret that like I
didn't dye my hair pink because I've
kept it for so long now anyway when it
comes to color and eyeshadow I think you
should just take the plunge and find a
look that inspires you and maybe try to
copy it in some way or take inspiration
from it I also think practicing makeup
and doing it at times where there's kind
of like low risk or no risk like you're
not going out anywhere if you hate it
you can just wash off your face you're
not like
getting ready to go out I think the
pressure of that is always like never do
new makeup when you're like have to go
to something important where you really
want to look good I just it usually
doesn't end up going well or you know
you're just risking too much and then
you can kind of put a damper on
everything so do something where there's
low risk and honestly I would start with
a pop of like color on the lower
lashline maybe on the inner corner you
could do if you're more adventurous like
the inner brow thing that I like to do a
lot that's always a fun way to do it and
for me I like to stick with like lighter
brighter colors as opposed to like
darker bolder colors and that helps me
and makes me still feel pretty if you're
used to a more lighter I look and I find
that having the same amount of depth
when it comes to colors even though
they're different colors makes it feel
more safe than if I'm doing something
like dark bold and blue it's like whoa
okay that's a lot I honestly think that
when it comes to these types of things
in makeup that one it just takes
practice and two you have to get used to
seeing yourself in these colors I
remember when I first started doing my
brows I remember in high school I would
like put a little bit in and I thought I
looked so insane like oh my gosh my
eyebrows are so dark and like if I look
back now it's like oh my gosh there's
like nothing in my brows so getting used
to seeing yourself in color makes you
more comfortable with it whereas if you
never do it and you never practice it
you aren't used to having any type of
color and it just you feel strange and
weird you just have to let yourself be
comfortable in that so I feel like the
more you do it the more comfortable
you'll get with it and the better you'll
get at the skills and find your
technique and what you like and fits
your eye shape and your preferences next
from black &amp;amp; nerdy she asks I'd love to
know what you do with your hair it's
tight but it has volume I am going to do
a hair video soon I just honestly guys
like my hair is probably one of my
biggest insecurities because it's so
thin I just don't have a lot I know you
guys don't see it but like you don't see
the back of my head okay like we pushed
everything to the front make it look at
on-camera and I'm telling you in the
back it's just it's just like the one
thing man like why can I do that thicker
hair but I will be doing a video I'll do
a video where I kind of show this I did
something where I showed you how to do
glitter roots and I
did show how I do this hairstyle in that
if I'm not mistaken so if I find that
video I'll leave it link and then when
it comes to the bun honestly my biggest
tip number one is just have like dirty
hair like second day hair with dry
shampoo is how I get the volume that I
need in kind of the grit and texture to
make the bun look kind of full on the
side and then but I still have it like a
top knot and have enough hair in my bun
at least to like make it look like I
have more than two hairs on my head and
then she did have a second question
which was how do I get my makeup to be
transfer / resistant proof is drugstore
foundation too inexpensive to get a
transfer resistant look or is their tip
or tips you could share I don't think
that inexpensive necessarily has
anything to do with being transfer proof
I think it's all about the formulas and
what they're claiming to do liquid to
powder foundations tend to be more
resistant something that has like a
water proof you know claim to it is
going to be more transfer resistant and
then overall I just think using a powder
for sure it's going to help make your
makeup stay on your skin I remember when
I first started makeup school we did
this project with cream paints and we
had to like paint a hibiscus on us and
then we powdered the out of it like
I'm telling you we like so much powder
on this thing and when we brushed it off
I'm telling you it lasted all day on me
and these are just normal creams they
don't drag down they don't do any of
that and stayed on basically all day and
so I'm not saying you need to do that
with your face but I'm just giving that
as an example that powder definitely
helps any type of foundation liquid
cream sit on the skin and stay better so
if you aren't powdering I definitely
suggest it I would play around with a
bunch of different powders though find
one that works the best for your skin if
your oily - I think using a good primer
that's gonna keep you matte will also
help with things not sliding off
throughout the day I won't lie though
for me my preference when it comes to
foundations isn't necessarily resistant
proof I like something that has a more
dewy or skin like finish a satin finish
and I find
those aren't necessarily the most
resistant on top of the fact that I have
oily skin and throughout the day since I
don't really touch up it does get oily
and I kind of like that I can just use
my finger throughout the day and like
you know kind of like clean up some oils
resprayed out my product and that's like
the opposite of resistant proof so
hopefully those tips help if you don't
powder that's gonna help the most and
maybe just looking for formulas that are
more matte looking for formulas that
maybe dry down to a powder finish and
just staying away from more duty
foundations we have a lot of questions
to go guys
okay next is from Chloe EOS I absolutely
love your makeup style I find it really
inspiring and unique thank you so much
and my question is where do you get your
makeup inspiration from from the makeup
itself or from any specific other
artists or from something else I would
say that it's kind of a mix of
everything I like looking at nature a
lot to get inspired I don't know like I
am just someone who gets inspired by a
lot of things I love just color in
general I've always been someone who
loved to color and be artistic and
creative throughout my childhood and
even now so I love just like I can look
at a picture I can see a theme I can see
like a movie poster and get inspired by
colors and just different things like
that I love textures I love shapes
I mean honestly so much like a Pinterest
board of not even like a makeup looks
just like different things can be so
inspiring to me
I do have artists that I really liked -
I really loved ELISA let me look on my
Instagram really fast so I can tell you
some of the artists I really really
enjoy of course it's like the time you
know you can't remember everyone's name
and then you're like how do you look
them up if you don't know their name
entirely okay let me see I know it's
like Alyssa something Alyssa Marie
artistry she's one of my all-time
favorites I think she's so great she
works with anastacio a lot so I think
she actually works for them she's just
she's great her eye looks are amazing I
think she does some awesome stuff so if
you don't follow her and Instagram I'll
leave her down below I also really like
Kelsey Anna she's part of the Kat Von D
Beauty team she just does some really
cool grungy different looks and that's
the type of stuff that I like when it
comes to makeup like I can't respect a
really blended neutral eye that looks
like a great date night look or just an
everyday natural look I can I respect
that so much and I think it's beautiful
but when it comes to really inspiring me
with makeup I love something different
when it comes to placement when it comes
to like shading just like all of that
that's what really like I'm like oh I
love that so um those two are like the
two I have right now but there are a lot
of others so if I can remember I will
leave other people linked down below if
you want to check out new accounts on
Instagram the next question comes from
Katrin H and the first question is how
many languages can you speak just
English I took French in high school and
I also took a little bit in college and
I can say Janice if I which is I don't
know mais je m'appelle Lauren Lauren I
don't know and then in college my first
semester of college I was super
ambitious and I was like I'm taking
Hindi so I took Hindi in college just
one semester and so I can say mera naam
Lauren hey that means my name is Lauren
I also know like gar means house so yeah
I'm really bad at learning languages and
I'm really horrible at the English
language so I think that is why I'm not
very good at the other languages as well
like I can speak fine I guess I just
don't know what things are called I
don't know the construction of a
sentence and all that so it's hard to
learn another language if you don't know
that about your own you just kind of
like know that like no it's not ran it's
running because it sounds better like
that's what I know
so yeah some other questions she asked
where would be your favorite place to
live me and Sam asked that of each other
all the time like where would we live
but honestly LA like right now for what
I wanted my career what I wanted my life
la is wearing where I love I love it
with what brand would you love to bring
out a product and what products would it
be I would love to bring out my own
brand and my own products um but I don't
know I mean I love I shadow so I mean
that's my natural first instinct is to
come out with an eyeshadow palette and
if it wasn't with my own brand it'd
probably be with color pop I love their
stuff
I think it's affordable and accessible
which is something that's really
important to me yeah and I think they do
like fun trendy stuff as well it's not
just all old so if I had
something it probably be colour-pop yeah
I think like off the top of my head
that's like the number one that I can
think of the next question is from Elise
on makeup she said I want you to your
favorite TV shows to stream now I watch
a lot of TV shows me and Sam love love a
good TV show so right now currently
we're watching veep we just finished
Westworld
and that's it we haven't started
anything new we need to start a new
drama I love Game of Thrones Oh probably
one of my all-time favorites I'm like an
oldie but a goodie
I love True Blood like I don't know why
I love True Blood so much but like I
freaking love it I would reach the show
I just like I really liked it and I
wonder going back if I would like it as
much now but I just have really good
memories with True Blood so yeah
vampires and like that when it comes to
more dramatic things I really love big
little lies I really loved the night
manager those are the ones I can think
of off the top of my head I mean we have
classics like The Office and like Parks
and Rec and things I love those too for
just like fun comedies yeah I like a lot
of stuff I feel like next is nut insula
bet I'm so bad I know that's how you say
it I'm so sorry but her question was how
old were you when you first started
playing with makeup and do you remember
what your first products were I was
about oh I don't even know I think I was
going into sixth grade and all my
friends were eyeliner and I didn't wear
anything I was just like natural nothing
and I was starting to get into my email
and so I remember they literally put it
on for me one of them held my eye down
and when it's them put it on my
waterline and that's where you wear your
eyeliner when you're young just like in
your waterline on your lower lashline
which is like the worst way I could
think of wearing eyeliner nowadays it's
like make sure I look heavy and
closed-off especially for my specific
high and yeah so I remember a couple
specific products I had this flirt I
shadow in a bronze color which I think
you could get at Kohl's and I use that
like every single day and then I also
remember going into Ulta and this was
like a long time ago when to face was
still like old a little old packaging
and they had this lava eyeliner
and I bought it it was so expensive I
remember being like I was so beyond
myself that this island was like $18 and
it was so black and cream Evo and like
that was like all me and my friends
favorite eyeliner so yeah the next
question is from Ella's hi Elle if you
guys don't know her she has a channel
here I'm gonna leave a link she's
awesome I love her but she said I would
love to know to some of your favorite
makeup artists art and what inspires you
so I kind of talked about the inspiring
things so we'll just talk about my
favorite makeup artist and I actually
was like I read this question and I was
like who inspires me as a makeup artist
who I love to watch and I realized that
and honestly like when I think of artist
I like know about Pat McGrath I know
about Kevin crine know about all these
other people but they aren't I I'd be
lying if I said I thought I read their
books and I did this and I got so much
inspiration there why I wanted to become
a makeup artist not true like I know
about them because of their brands not
sri honestly it for me when it comes to
makeup artists the people that inspired
me our special effects makeup artist in
my makeup school it was mostly about you
know beauty makeup and high fashion all
these are the things but we did do
special effects TV and film makeup and
it's something that I don't consider
myself to be very good at I don't feel
confident in it I can do like little
things here and there if you've seen my
Instagram like I'm proud of those looks
I just did something that definitely I
guess intimidates me so when I hear
about and see things from people who are
like the Masters of special effects it
is so inspiring to me and I just give
them the most mad props ever so some of
these people are Dick Smith he is like
the godfather of makeup he did the make
a for the Godfather he also did the
makeup for Amadeus which he won an Oscar
for he did the makeup in The Exorcist
and yeah he's just like a classic og
special effects artist he taught himself
he has created so many techniques that
we use today from his own brain like
they weren't taught he came up with them
and now they're like industry standards
another one is Rick Baker he's done
things like the 2001 planet of the apes
he's done How the Grinch Stole Christmas
he also worked on the exercise with Dick
Smith he's won like seven Oscars for
makeup which is crazy he did the
American Werewolf in London which is
like a huge feat in special effects it
practical effects of like him turning
into a werewolf it's not CGI
it's practical special effects they came
up with that contraption and created it
and those are the things that to me are
just like mind-blowing because I know
how much time and energy and work went
into creating that gag that you see on
screen for however long I mean took so
long so much money so many resources and
so much effort and that's what I really
respect another special effects artists
that I really respect is Richard red
Liston he is someone who actually went
to my school and so I think I have like
a special connection to him that way he
came into a demo for us at the school
which was like a beat up makeup which is
really awesome and I've also seen him do
some things that I mattes but I think
he's just super talented he inspires me
because you know like I just can see
myself in him in the sense that like he
went where I went and I just think it's
really cool he's worked on a ton of
things but he was like the key makeup
artist on Batman vs Superman he was also
the key makeup artist on the new Twin
Peaks like TV series so yeah if you go
to his IMDB which I'll link all three of
their IMDb's they have so many credits
they're amazing just true artists and
just so skilled and talented I just
respect their hard work I know it takes
a ton of time and yeah I think they're
really awesome when it comes to makeup
artist next is a question from Mac we
see enta maybe that's how you say it she
asked if you would only be allowed to
pick three beauty products for the rest
of your life what products would you
choose I admire you lots well thank you
so much I
oh if I could only pick three products I
would probably pick a mascara I would
probably pick an eyebrow pencil and then
I would probably pick like a concealer
and I would obviously stop skincare
because that's not makeup but those are
the three oh do like concealer you can
kind of like spread out throughout the
whole face if you really wanted to or
just under your eyes or ever you have
problem areas mascara because my
eyelashes are blonde and it just gives
me a little bit of definition and then
same with the eyebrows I just need a
little bit of definition so those are
the three things I think next is a
question from Jamie McNulty it says in
terms of whether or not you want to
start Instagram stories oh this is like
it's her whole comments so sorry if it
brings you joy then share it with us I
know I'd love it but if you're not up to
it it's okay and for the
lqa what are you doing when you're
happiest oh this is a cool question when
I'm happiest I think I'm one inspired by
whatever it is I'm doing so like if it's
with my channel it's like I have a lot
of ideas I'm excited about
I always feel the most happy filming and
the most happy uploading and editing and
doing all of that when I'm just inspired
and then when it comes to other things
in my life I think one just hanging out
with my husband he inspires me I respect
him so much I just love him so much so
yeah that is something and I think with
our relationship he respects me so much
he's so supportive which gives me an
environment to be myself and be creative
I can be 100% myself with him and that's
something I love and then probably I'm
the most happy when I'm traveling so you
know me and Sam traveling is like the
best but yeah when I'm basically
whenever I'm with Sam I am
I feel be happiest I've tried to read
this 700 times okay next is a question
from Sabrina Sherman she says hey girl I
just wanted to know what made you want
to start making YouTube videos your
channel is my new 2018 fave thanks for
giving me something to look forward to
every day oh thank you so much I'm so
glad you like the channel that you found
it for me I was watching YouTube for a
long time before I started my channel
and I've had my channel a little over
three years now and I would say it
probably watched videos for a good two
to three years before I started and it
was just something I was like I think
I'd be good at it I think I'd really
enjoy it I want to give my two cents on
products and I had so much makeup I was
very much into buying like literally
every new release and so I just felt
like I had all the stuff already like
the only thing I wasn't doing was like
the actual filming and uploading to
YouTube part and so when we moved here
to LA from Arizona I just was like I'm
gonna do it and really it was my empties
trash that forced me to do it I would
save my empties and project pan and do
all that stuff off-camera like I'm
telling you I lived the life of a beauty
guru outside of filming it even though
most beauty gurus do not project man so
because I was moving here I didn't want
to bring all my empty trash with me but
I wanted to fill my empties video so
that was like my push and then I think
just starting a new chapter kind of just
gave me some that little bit of extra
courage I needed to actually do it
have quite a few questions from
Alexandria Sutton she said I could do it
in they get ready with me which I
totally didn't do because I would be
blending foundation or putting powder on
for like seven hundred years I just
wanted to focus on the questions and
knew it was already gonna be a long time
girl she says do you have any pets no I
don't I'm gonna I'm gonna say something
that I think a lot of people I know
aren't gonna relate to me I'm just not a
pet person I love dogs I love cats if I
had to pick a pet I'd probably pick a
cat but Sam's allergic so that's an
impossibility I think one I'm just too
busy currently in my life like I just
don't have the time and I don't honestly
want to make the time but I love dogs
like I love like hanging out with them
like when it's going to be for a short
amount of time but I don't want them to
like I I don't know I know a lot of guys
are dog people I know a lot of people
that's earth or dog people I think
they're so cute and I love them I love
animals I just don't want to own them
like I don't want all the responsibility
that comes if I'm being honest like
that's why I tried to I keep it honest
with you so no I don't have any I want
one and I tell Sam sometimes like I want
a dog but then I know deep down in my
heart like no not yet not yet maybe once
we have kids or I don't know we have
more space I feel like I could have I
could have more space to share with them
but right now like I can barely live
here you cannot live here - the next
question she asked what kind what kind
are they and how long have you had them
non-existent at my mom's house we have
two dogs in a cat though what are your
favorite videos to watch I love Beauty
videos and I like things that are like
more opinion-based I guess you could say
so whether it's on a topic in the beauty
community or someone's favorite this or
at least favorite that so something
that's more opinion like that like a
talking video about makeup and then I
also do like reviews if it's a product
that I am interested in I like watching
those types of reviews but more than
anything I think I am drawn to people's
personalities so if it's someone I enjoy
watching I'll probably watch a lot of
their videos the next question was you
find it's hard to make friends as an
adult definitely for sure I think to
being married sometimes makes it a
little bit more difficult like if you
don't have other friends that are
married or whatever
moving to LA was kind of rough at first
because we came out here just me and Sam
no friends no family like just starting
a brand new life
and we're finally at the place where we
have friends that I've made through work
and then you know we've just had common
interest and that's amazing like we're
gonna go to an Oscars party and stuff so
that's great but I definitely think you
have to try harder when it comes to
being an adult you aren't put in as many
situations to meet new people and I
definitely think it's worth it like
being more out there and trying to just
you know be more carefree just like say
hi to people and and whatever I don't
feel like I'm the best at making new
friends I think I'm a fun person I just
it's like more the initial like I need
to meet people and a lot of the times
I'm working from home or I'm on set and
it's like kind of business so yeah
definitely harder for sure than like in
high school or in college even though in
college I worked full-time and so I
wasn't making a ton of friends next
question was how do you find balance
with work your husband and YouTube I'm
gonna have to like save some of these
guys I didn't realize how many they were
and how much this was so I'm gonna keep
going but it's gonna probably be appart
to later on but the next question from
her was how do you find balance between
work your husband and YouTube and
honestly so I'm a makeup artist but that
means I do gig work so I don't have like
a nine-to-five I do gigs when they come
up I have a music video here I have a
shoot here I have whatever it is a
private client or whatever and so that
gives me a lot of time to do YouTube so
for me it's like when I have jobs a lot
of jobs I have a lot of jobs and then
when I don't I have a lot of time for
YouTube and so yeah I like to fact film
so I film multiple videos in one take
that's how I can also make YouTube work
so well for me is because I just you
know will sit down film two three four
ideas and then I have footage four times
when I am on set or I'm doing other
things or me and say I want to have a
day to ourselves because we're both off
so that definitely helps me just use my
time than most wisely like I don't have
a permanent setup of my situation so I
don't to put up and tear down my lights
every single time for each new video
that would be so much extra time instead
I can kind of collect all my thoughts do
multiple videos and that
helps and they'll say like me and Sam
work really hard right now and we're
hustling a lot too um yeah get get
things going make our dreams happen so
we hang out when we can but I think
we're also very supportive of each other
doing what we need to do and so
sometimes you know even if he's you know
worked 50 hours for one week at his
normal job and he still has class his
acting class he's on sets and doing
different things and so you know we just
try to make as much time to see each
other as possible and we really enjoy
spending the time that we do have with
each other but we also I think right now
just currently at this point in our
lives we just have an agreed
understanding that it's like let's do
this you know the next question is when
is your birthday my birthday is January
21st and then she said how do you seem
so relatable and so cool I don't know um
no I don't know just just a person you
know but thank you not that I'm honestly
not that cool I'm I would say relatable
is more than the cool part we'll move on
to some other questions this one is from
crushed Bella and it says it'd be nice
to do Q&amp;amp;A she said this might cause
drama but have you ever tried chantix no
products her brand and her palate with
BH Cosmetics and did you like it she's
not necessarily a big fan of sanik so I
haven't not tried any of her products
and I know she has her collaboration
with BH she's like done two different
ones I haven't tried those I really
haven't tried much from BH Cosmetics and
then I know that she's had her own line
of brushes for forever I remember before
I even had a channel she was using her
own brushes that's so beauty line and
yeah I don't I mean it's not that I
don't want to try them I just they're
not necessarily on my radar at the
moment they seemed fine she's been using
them for a long time I like Shannon so I
think she's really sweet and nice and I
think that she's someone who truly loves
makeup is actually inspired and she does
the content that she wants to do and I
enjoy her channel so I don't know about
the quality of her makeup products or
anything but yeah that's my two cents on
that I'm gonna answer like three more
sets of people's questions and then I'm
gonna do like a separate QA a little bit
later at some other point with the rest
of the questions on here next I have
questions what's your favorite palette
this is really hard for me because I
feel like I'm someone
when I do my makeup I want to be
inspired and so like different things
inspire me at different times and one
palette can be really great for specific
day or time of like my life and then
other palettes wouldn't but if I had to
pick one I think I always go with the
modern Renaissance because I love the
formula I like the colours I can do a
lot of different looks with it it's just
something that is like a good go-to if
I'm traveling or whatever I know I can
use that palette and get a multitude of
different looks that I know I'll be
happy with next is what's the best
makeup tip you would give I really like
your channel very informative thank you
so much if I could give one makeup tip I
think it would just be that like I don't
think you should let any type of rules
or what's trendy or what you see other
people doing stop you from doing
something like some idea that you have
or being creative with your makeup even
if it's not conventionally pretty or
beautiful I'm just like experimenting
and playing around and practicing I
think will help you grow as an artist it
will help you with your technique and it
helps you just find your own personality
and like space in the world when it
comes to makeup and I think just in
general I think it's like a great way to
get to know yourself and your
preferences so yeah not letting someone
tell you you can't do this you can do
this like trying out for yourself and
realizing like I don't do that because I
don't like the way it looks or I do this
when I want to look like whatever I
don't know I don't know I just think
like having your own opinions and
forming your own opinions based off of
trial and error is really important and
that question was from makeup by Co V
next Kara II asked how to do and your
husband meet and was it an instant love
feeling or did it need time to grow like
I said me and Sam met in high school he
was a senior I was a sophomore I just
loved him he was just the nicest guy and
the sweetest guy and I think he's still
the cutest guy ever and I knew that I
loved Sam three weeks into our
relationship we said I love you you know
I feel like we kind of are people that
got lucky like I think we're special
because it's us but um like I think our
love is special but I also a lot of the
times think like there's so many times I
feel like people think that they loved
each other three weeks into a
relationship and like I can tell you and
sit here and be like no I knew it was
love but I haven't had any other
experiences to really base that off of
sometimes I feel a little naive when it
comes to relationships because of the
fact that like I got so
and I realized that I've got like
insanely lucky to find the love of my
life when I was 15 years old and to have
a person who Sam is just such a good
person like even my mom my grandma like
you know I think sometimes people get
into relationships and get married and
you know everyone's like happy for them
but they're kind of like I don't know
you know you have like maybe a couple
naysayers they're just like okay do what
you want like I'm happy for you if
that's what you want and in with Sam
it's like it wasn't like that everyone
is like a hundred percent like he's the
best person ever he's I I promise I'm
sorry if I'm like talking my
relationship up too much but um this is
like really honestly how I feel he's
just an amazing person and like my mom
is like we all need to say I'm not life
and my grandma's like you know I just am
so happy that you guys are truly in love
like I can tell you guys are so in love
and perfect for each other and um you
know that doesn't mean that we don't
fight or anything but yeah it was kind
of instant love I mean I didn't like a
look at him and then like we've looked
at each other and locked eyes but it
definitely has been a spark that's been
there since the very beginning and as
much as we've grown and changed and you
know our relationship has changed so
much when we first started dating I mean
we were obsessed with each other we
would hang out every single day yeah it
was like it's just hardcore from the
beginning you know and I think as we've
grown older we've we've had to change a
lot and we've been able to do that and
grow together in our beliefs in the
world and as people and not so amazing
and yeah I don't know where I'm going
with that but um just you guys know
we've been together in October our
anniversary for dating is October 13th
2007 yeah 2007 so this year will be 11
years we'll be together and then I
believe we'll be married four years in
November of this year so yeah we've been
together quite a while I'm gonna leave
this off with brandy James questions
because she has quite a few here and
then again we'll do the second part so
she said I love how this look came out
because it was like a get ready with me
and she says as long as it looks good it
works I'd be fine as wearing two
different eye colors out for the Q&amp;amp;A she
has quite a few listed here so the first
what's your favorite fast-food place or
restaurant I love chick-fil-a so much
like me and Sam always get the calendars
for each other for Christmas I would say
the last two years we haven't really
gotten each other gifts but well liked
by the calendars and that's like our
gift to each other I would say
chick-fil-a is probably my number one
favorite but then after that it's like
Taco Bell or in and out and those are
kind of like the only fast-food places
we go to number two if you had to dye
your hair a new non-traditional hair
color tomorrow what would it be I'd
probably go with like the yellow trend
honestly I think one I like that it's
warm toned I just like warm tones on me
I think it's kind of fun and different
and cool so probably something yellow
maybe bordering on like turning green
but green is just can be scary because
you know if it's fading out it can look
kind of bad depending but probably
yellow I think that that looks so cool
so number three is if you could only buy
new makeup products or skincare products
for the next year which would you choose
so I had to start over from nothing I
would honestly probably try new brands
so like when it comes to skincare at
college buy some glossy a stuff yeah I
think that's the most I can think of for
now well honestly it's glossy a stuff
and then when it comes to foundation I
mean I would pick up like my staple
stuff again just because I know it works
but I would just you know be more
experimental I would say like when it
comes to the powders in my collection
they are kind of like my old school way
of doing my foundation and stuff like
things I would do like a year ago and
I've kind of changed how I am so I would
probably like only pick up loose powders
instead of pressed ones and things like
that I don't have anything specific I
feel like I have a lot of great things
in my collection I'm using currently and
would repurchase those first and then
anything that's already on my list is
probably on my list currently to number
four is how often do you go out with
friends and what do you do often I would
say that I'm someone who hangs out with
friends like once twice maybe three
times a month three times is like
pushing it but I try to have like some
type of experience with people other
than like me and my husband every month
at least once if not twice I try but me
and Sam hang out a lot I know
it makes me sound like I'm such a
recluse I promise I'm not I think just
like a lot of my friends here in LA are
super busy too they might be in
relationships as well so I feel like we
get together for work sometimes and then
we try to get together but you know
we're all kind of busy doing things for
me too I'm the type of person that has a
lot of relationships with people like I
have a really core group of friends from
high school that me and Sam are both
really good friends with because we were
mutual friends because we started dating
in high school and we're the type of
people that we cannot see each other for
three years and then like we go home for
holiday and we'll like go out to dinner
and we're back exactly where we were
like it's like nothing we didn't skip a
beat we didn't miss anything and that's
something I really appreciate with my
friends and it's a type of friend I am
it's like even with all this distance
and space and time we haven't seen each
other we just we click right back up so
and then the other part of that question
was what do you often do movies we go to
movies all the time movie pass makes
that possible for us here in LA so I
love going to movies me and Sam I guess
go out to eat that's something we like
to do is like an activity and then I
don't know like I'm not a club person or
a bar person me and Sam really don't
drink that much alcohol even like the
times I drink I drink specifically
because we're going out friends or doing
something like that I don't like drink
in my everyday life we also like to
travel so we'll take like a day trip
here or plan trips and stuff so yeah
those are like the biggest things we do
there were like nine questions so number
five is what clothing stores your
favorite how much are you willing to pay
for an item of clothing I would say my
absolute favorite clothing store is
forever 21 plus I think that it's
affordable and they have some cute stuff
so like that's like my go-to place I
would say a majority of my clothing is
from forever 21 I don't spend a lot of
money on clothes because I just
currently don't have a ton of money to
spend on clothing like it's just not in
the budget that doesn't mean that I
don't want to ever or I wouldn't it's
just not in the cards currently I'm also
the type of person that wears the same
thing over and over I don't care how
much it is if I like it I'd like it you
know like I don't care if it's cheap I
kind of like the t-shirt look like I'm
the cheque person I would be in a band
tea and sweats like whole sweats that
are cute or like a pair of jeans like
every single day of my life I think
that's just my style and what I
yeah I'm just not like a fancy girl I
like to do makeup that's what I like to
do I would say though overall I'm
definitely a little bit cheap when it
comes to clothing next number six who is
your male and female celebrity crush oh
okay so for male my male celebrity crush
is Ryan Gosling a hundred percent I like
to think Sam looks like him so you know
I just love him so much and then for a
female that's so tough I think there's
so many beautiful women in Hollywood I
would say like Janelle Monae is like
someone I think is just absolutely
beautiful
I think she's stunning so she's
definitely one of my celebrity crush
women yeah she's like the person that
comes to mind honestly right now I think
she's beautiful
number seven is what was your most
embarrassing moment or just a fun one I
don't know I don't feel like I've been
insanely embarrassed before I remember
in grade school I did have my pants rip
on me but it was at a time when I used
to wear like jackets all the time to
school because I'm sure it was like a
self-conscious thing but I would always
have a sweatshirt on and so I actually
had it tighter on my waist when I was in
class and like jumping around or
whatever I did to make my pants rip and
so yeah luckily that stopped it and then
I could go to the thing but I felt so
mortally embarrassed I feel like I have
this like level of anxiety all the time
that like it's hard to have something
like super embarrassing because I'm
always at this like high level of like
feeling like nervous about this or like
anxious that someone's looking at me
this way or that or whatever you know so
yeah number eight what is something
about you that people usually don't
guess / get wrong I don't know I think
that maybe I can come off a little
intimidating in person I don't know
maybe not though I feel like I can't
like strike up conversations like random
people like - your worker or this or
whatever but I think sometimes that can
come off wrong like I'm a pretty strong
person and so sometimes that can be
taken as like like a little scary or I'm
just a very honest person I'm not very
good at like hiding how I feel like if I
feel it
wait I feel like I'm trying to and I'm
not so yeah and then number nine what
was the rudest customer experience
you've ever had at work I'm working
retail you get just so many rude people
I mean there are so many great people
but there are a lot of rude people and I
don't have a specific situation that
comes up to mind at the moment just
because it's been a while since I've
worked retail I will say though being
someone the customer and having some
employee be rude to me oh my gosh so for
the situation I'd bought some items from
Claire's for set and we didn't end up
using it so I had the item it wasn't
used I didn't have my receipt anymore
though and I was like oh can I return
these and she was like oh no you can't
return this I wasn't expecting to get
like cash back or anything like that
like I knew I would get store credit but
I was like why can't I return this you
know and she was like no you just can't
and it was one of those situations where
you could tell that they don't know what
they're talking about like sometimes you
get up to a counter and you're talking
to someone and they are telling you
something maybe you don't hear but you
know that they know what you're talking
about this was not that case and they're
just like a media attention like I could
just tally mm-hmm and Sam I felt so bad
for him he's just sitting there like
please don't please don't do this so I
was like oh well what if someone got
like an item for their birthday and
didn't get like a gift receipt they
can't return that item and she's like no
I'm like this is Claire's this is a
store for children what are you talking
about so I asked to see the return
policy and I looked next to the cash
register and actually headed up so I
read her the return policy to her own
store and I was like it says right here
you can and then she was like let me
call my manager yeah so I was sitting
there just baffled at how rude she was
to me and how I'm just I think the thing
for me like why this situation just irks
me so much is I am the type person if I
don't know something I cannot sit there
and be like definitively be like no I
would be like I'm not sure let me check
even if I knew I'd probably be like let
me check again unless it's like
something that I had like down pat and
so for someone to just like not know
 but act like they know is such
a pet peeve of mine and it just like
rubbed me
wrong way it was so and that's what I
was like I will wait here I will
I'm getting my $8 back damn it that was
like a more recent one it wasn't that
recent but that's like one that sticks
out in my mind because I just I can't
it's more of the principle of it like at
that point I was like I'm gonna return
this for the principle of it because you
do have a frickin return policy actually
maybe I could teach you something or
anyway so I think there's one more
question and then one this oh no all
right so we're leaving it off that no
it's alright it's a little bit negative
I'm sorry thank you so much to everyone
who asked a question I seriously
appreciate it it's insane to me that
anyone even cares about anything I have
to say if you want to see the part 2 to
this QA definitely let me know down
below and that's everything thank you so
so much for watching guys and I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
