born thank you so much for watching this
is going to be my top 15 Coastal Scents
eyeshadows you guys know from my lips
stupid series I'll leave that playlist
link down below and just in general I
love single shadows I love them they're
my favorite I'm really into them I love
it you can create your own palette I
love that you can rearrange shadows and
get inspired by different color
combinations and a palette and then on
top of that Coastal Scents is one of the
most inexpensive places you can go to
get single shadows and honestly the
quality of the shadows for the price is
amazing so I went through my collection
I have quite a few shadows I'm working
on swatching my palette today as well
it's all about single shadows today but
I went through my collection oh my gosh
No
well one of mine just cracked the best
exciting but these are V shadows that I
picked out my top 15 shadows from
Coastal Scents I picked these for a
variety of reasons either they're my
most loved my most use so they have like
pan on them I use them all the time I
love them or they're from the
pigmentation like you just can't beat
the pigmentation and how beautifully
metallic they are for the price and then
some of them are just quality like I
just feel like this is a high-end
eyeshadow that's what it feels like on
the hands it's how it performs I don't
necessarily use all these together as a
palette but you definitely could create
some really fun looks with these I hope
this helps I know that it can be kind of
overwhelming on the website there's a
million hot pots and when I say a
million I mean like 350 like
legitimately 350 of them or so so it can
be overwhelming to look at all those
what's going to be good what's not and
from everything I have these are just
the ones that I can tell you like you're
going to be golden if you get these last
before we get into colors I just want to
say I definitely suggest signing up for
their email so that way you guys can be
informed when they do their sale I think
they do it like two or three times a
year or their hotpots will go on sale
for a dollar a piece like 99 cents
that's when I suggest buying a few of
them you just can't be a dollar shadow
it can't be it I'm just going to talk
about these really fast and I'll show
swatches you know as I'm talking the
first rate here is sham LAN nude from
ETS at Coastal Scents this is just a
matte cream shade this one is a bit dark
for me it isn't quite as bright as I
would like but I think it would work for
so many skin tones I find that I run
through the shades the most so if I can
get it for
expensive I think it's worth it I
definitely suggest this shade I think
you'll get a lot of use out of it next I
have the color peach fuzz and this is
kind of a classic pink champagne color
mine is a bit crumbly
I dropped it a long time ago so I don't
know if it's partially because I
couldn't press it really hard back in
the pan or if it is just kind of more of
a soft press and so it can be a little
bit crumbly the pigmentation on this is
really nice this has a nice creamy
texture and it's very metallic I really
enjoy the shade this is the perfect lid
shade it's a perfect like Bridal type of
love just an everyday look I feel like a
lot of people like these types of shades
you could also use it as an inner corner
highlight again just a nice basic shadow
the next two shadows are kind of similar
but I wanted to suggest both of them the
first one here is pumpkin pie as you can
tell I've already hit pan on the shades
because I love it I love using this all
over the eye as a one shadow look so
I'll put it in the crease I'll buff it
on the lid it just gives me some
definition but it's still light looking
I still look fresh which is definitely a
look I like I mean I look really made-up
two days but I usually like just a very
light look it is not just great I love
it it's pigmented but it's also not like
so pigmented or dark that it's like you
know things that crazy way too fast
that's what I like I like something you
can kind of build up and so I really do
enjoyed this shadow the next shadow I
have I told you it's very similar this
is the color mo7 also known as oatmeal
tan some of my shadows I've had for so
long that I bought them before they
changed over to actually having names
for their shadows they were just all
numbers which is an awesome improvement
I love names like it's just more fun
right this is another just matte kind of
mid-tone warm Brown I've used this a lot
to do peanut butter in like the Too
Faced peanut butter and jelly palette
it's a little powdery but I don't find
it to be like an issue at all it's not
like patchy or chalky in any way really
enjoy using this again I've used it all
over the lid or just in the crease as a
transition and last for my top row here
is the color my type this is a really
pretty kind of like satin taupe type of
color I'm not the biggest fan of cool
tone colors but I do think that this is
a nice one if you are it has a bit of a
purple undertone to it
have a nice shine to it it feels nice
and smooth to the touch it's very
pigmented I tend to like to apply these
shadows with my finger just to get the
best pigmentation I'm like that with all
my shadows high-end low-end whatever but
I do really like this one and I think
you'd really enjoy it if you like these
types of colors the next three shadows
are all quite metallic this is dark
goldenrod and this is a duochrome shadow
it's like a green gold and then it has
unless this like red flash to it as well
really really cool definitely just an
interesting shade I don't see this all
the time and that's part of the reason I
wanted to put it in here cuz it's just
one of the cooler shadows that they have
to offer on top of that I feel like the
formulation is beautiful it feels like a
high-end shadow I definitely suggest
this one if you're looking for something
a little bit more fun or you like these
like golden olive type of colors the
next shadow I have here is one I use use
all the time it's called bright copper
or in my case and the zero three it's
super super soft to the touch and it's
so pigmented I still have to use almost
like a sticky basis because although
it's pigmented I find it just works the
best and just like stays on the eye and
just looks the most foiled it can on top
of a base or foil if you like those warm
fiery colors this definitely would be up
your alley and on top of that it's just
a beautiful formulation I really do like
the plum it's beautiful next is the
color that actually just broke on me in
the palette I just pressed it back in
it's called new penny or any 23 this is
another one just like that last one it's
just absolutely beautiful
super super pigmented super shiny and
metallic I don't know if it's because I
just had these a long time that they
just are you know falling apart Lourdes
I'm just beat them up and it's just been
a long time that way or what or if
they're just soft formulations because a
lot of my makeup ink also fall apart I
don't know if it's just me like damn if
you're looking for something that's a
little bit more like golden bronze
instead of copper I definitely suggest
the shade absolutely stunning I have two
maps to finish out the next row this
here is called fine wine and it's a
medium wine shade it's not gonna swatch
very great but I love this for it kind
of differ
almost transition color it reminds me of
very smoothy I believe or blueberry
swirl one of the shades in my dose of
colors ice cream palette I think it is
really really pretty it just is like a
bit of a different take it's not too
bright where it just looks crazy but it
gives your eyes something I think this
would look great on green eyes like
definitely make them pop because of that
purple undertone on brown eyes though -
it would really bring them out I just
really like the shade for just a little
bit of a different transition color you
can definitely build it up to get a more
opaque look or you can have almost like
a nice soft with of this as your
transition it's really beautiful next is
Oktoberfest and this is going to be a
very popular trendy color it's a nice
warm brown it reminds me of honest Razia
Sienna I love using this as kind of like
my deeper shade I'm very fair so I don't
want to go to too dark so this gives me
that perfect amount of depth in the
outer corner if I'm doing like let's say
I'm doing a wheel tan in like the
transition increase and then I can put
this on the outer corner with a little
bit of peach fuzz on the lid that's such
a beautiful look just classes easy
effortless you just feel pretty in it I
feel like it can swatch a little patchy
but I feel like on the eye is lent out
really nice and it's really beautiful
we are onto the last five shadows and
all of these are a bit more colorful so
if you like a little more spice in your
life this row is for you the first day
they have to mention is cantaloupe size
this is a matte kind of golden yellow so
pretty I love using yellows and kind of
like unexpected ways all over the lid up
into the brow bone as a soft transition
where you just kind of don't know what's
different about the look but it's this
it's yellow it's like popping out at you
if you kind of just want to explore
yellow but don't want to commit too much
it's such a good price point this is a
bit sheer but you can build it up I kind
of like that about it I like sheer
things that you can build up and kind of
do what you want and be the artist you
know the shadow and they're doing all
the work for you you kind of have to
decide what you want to do pick your
opacity and go from there next is an
absolute beauty this is the color Lake
Shore and this is probably the best
feeling best formulated shatter that
I've ever felt from coastal friends this
is a dual chrome so it's like a blue
with a golden ship it is just so nice if
this was an Anasazi palette I believe it
if this was a
forever single I believe it I mean it's
absolutely beautiful I'm not a huge fan
of Blues I have like a periwinkle blue
on my eyes today but this one is really
really pretty if you do like blues or
you want to explore this one's great
whoo this next one is so pretty - I love
this on the back it says n08 and on this
site that either is magenta or cinnabar
Rose I don't know which one I kind of
think of cinnabar Rose though because I
don't know I don't think it's magenta
anyway absolutely beautiful it is a
matte shade and I think this is just
stronger mine is very crumbly again I
don't know if that's the age or just my
shadow or what it looks like a little
powdery but it's so beautiful if you
blend this out your it's going to look
great don't worry
like I love this type of shade I think
this looks so good with neutral with
like a really pretty metallic it just
kind of brings that pop I also love that
although this is a bit deeper it still
has that brightness about it I feel like
sometimes you can shave your legs on
with a nice purple but by the time you
get on the eye and you blend it out it
just kind of almost looks a neutral or
it looks really dark but this one is
going to stay bright but also give you
that pop of color just pretty love it
love it love it we have another blue I
know I don't wear a lot of Blues but
these blues are just formulated so good
this is blue Hawaiian
if you want like that really fun kind of
pop of blue on the lower lash line this
is going to give it to you without all
the work of like finessing and trying to
build up a color it is so pretty I
wouldn't call this a duochrome
it packed the tiniest amount of like a
sheen to it that's like almost purple
like almost quite I don't want to get
you too excited because like maybe
you'll look at it and be like Lauren
it's just kind of like a satin blue but
I definitely see this bit of iridescent
to it really really beautiful again I
think this would be just pretty as a pop
of blue on the bottom lashline and you
don't need to like build it up I feel
like a lot of Blues and palettes it's
like you know yeah I really build up
that lash line and the last shadow has
to talk to you guys about is the color n
e 12 and let me look that up and tell
you what that actually means so this is
also known as coral rose and this is
just a really pretty pink color you guys
know I had to throw in a pink this
almost has a similar kind of look as
blue Hawaiian where it has like almost a
sphere
add essence to it it can be a little
powdery but I find that if you work it
on the lid with your finger it's not
going to look patchy or chalky or
anything really like this color though I
can get just a fun pop of pink it's not
too hot pink it's not too like dark pink
it's kind of just in the middle and I
just really like it it's a nice one for
like on a lid or just something fun I
mean look how pretty that is this is
like summer collection right alright
guys that is everything I hope this
helped um I have a definitely different
style though I'm not a super neutral
girl necessarily I definitely suggest
checking them out and getting them for
that good price so even if you do pick
up some shadows that you aren't the
biggest fan of you're not a bunch of
money also if you have some favorite
shadows from Coastal Scents leave them

know what your favorites are and kind of
get even more suggestions from you guys
