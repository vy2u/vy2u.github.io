my channel I've been seeing a lot of
people do like makeup baskets and a lot
of people do that on the regular and
I've decided that since I'm in the ton
of projects I think this would be a
really good way for me to focus in on
things and make sure that the things in
my mood drawers which is what I have are
things that I'm actually wanting to use
up or things i can focus on and then
adding a few pops of colors or things
i'm going to focus on now some people do
a weekly 1 i'm going to actually do a
biweekly one so every two weeks yeah um
just because i want to give myself time
to use products and i personally just
don't change up my makeup that much i
usually stick to products they're about
two weeks or so so I thought that'd be
good and I could just show you guys what
I'm using some of it is going to be a
lot of repeats especially if it's like
in a project or something it's probably
gonna just always be in there but other
things are flipping in and out and I'm
trying to use different things or just
explore and rediscover things in my
collection i'm going to show you guys
like a whole different like ankle for
this video of just my drawers but I
wanted to give like a little bit of a
face intro let's get into my makeup
drawers and see what I'm going to use
for the next two weeks so here's a
close-up of my drawers I organize these
in a very specific way I guess so this
top drawer here is face products that's
like my base these are face products
like blush and bronzer highlighter and
also brow products these are going to be
I shadows these are like liners and
anything in like a stick form for your
eye mascara anything like that and then
in the bottom line of lips so let's just
get into this top drawer here this is my
chart um powder that I'm trying to use
up for the year I'm almost done with
that but that's in here because I've
been using that regularly I have my
Rimmel stay matte powder i use this on
top of that powder or just if I need to
just any fallout off of my cheeks from I
shot or anything like that so I keep
that in there this is the benefit boring
concealer I've been using as my mom gave
it to me when she was here because she
didn't like it and i've been using this
kind of for my eyebrows but also just on
any acne spots i have just for like spot
concealing this is the Maybelline Baby
skin primer this is what
been using now that I've used up the
benefit one that I was using and this is
also in my yearly project pan this is
the Laura behind the scenes I primer
this is just in here in case I want
something that is in a shimmery base for
an eye primer I just have it in the
store even though I don't need to I
guess this is the pixi flawless and
poreless primer I've been using this
kind of almost as like a pre moisturizer
before primer just because it doesn't
pry my skin well enough for how I like
to prime it and but this isn't another
project i have just my real in the
project pan going on right now i also
have the hourglass ambient lighting
powder palette in there so this is you
know all the powders I've mostly just
been using the middle one here which is
called incandescent light as a
highlighter it's been so beautiful I've
been absolutely loving it so that's
really the whole reason the whole
pallets in there is just for that one
shade lately this is the bare minerals
bisque powder concealer I've been using
this under my eyes I set my under eye
concealer and I'm just doing that
because I'm trying to use this up in a
project it doesn't do any brightening or
anything so I'm just trying to work
through it so i can get it gone these
are two samples i have in my sample
round up this is the benefit bigger than
BB Big Easy liquid to powder foundation
I've been using that and then this I
have not used yet but this is the coach
n doe moisture foundations a sample of
that the last thing in here is my
Maybelline concealer in the fair shade
this is one of my favorite concealers
ever and yeah I use it under my eyes
mostly also for a face foundation type
thing I have this organic we're from
physicians formula trying to use up by
Cinco de Mayo this just doesn't fit into
the drawer so I actually keep this out
on top but this is also part of that
same category of like face priming and
faces this is my second drawer this is
all going to be mostly face products and
also um eyebrow stuff so first thing I
have this tart flushed cheek stain this
is also my Cinco de Mayo finish five by
Cinco de Mayo so I'm just trying to use
that up this is my benefit what's up
highlighter this is just a small version
i'm trying to use that up by the end of
May in a different project pan so I keep
it in there this is my too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer I'm trying to
use that up it's in a broad
japan so that's in here this is a stila
the Stila kitten shimmer duo it's the
highlighting duo in the small version
and I'm trying to use that up by the end
of the year so i just have been keeping
it in there so I could reach for it and
then I also include it this week this is
something like new or that I switch out
this is the Sephora pantone universe
marsala blush trio that came out limited
edition and I just wanted to get some
nice we're out of that and it's such
pretty color so that's in there if I
want to reach for one of those blushes
and besides like what i already have
here or highlighter i also have this I
base this is the tart shimmering golden
beige cream shadow I'm trying to use
this up by Cinco two-mile I'm telling
you all this stuff is like project pan
stuff because I'm really trying to focus
and what's great is it only gives me the
option to use these items instead of
like you know having everything and then
choosing something else but anyway
trying to use that up so that's in here
the rest your brow products which is oh
no this isn't this is the two-faced
glitter glue shadow insurance I just
have this in here because I never know
what I'm going to use glitter I love
using glitter so it's just nice to have
it handy at any time I have my naked
basics in here by urban decay just
because I've been using this shade for
my brows lately and I've been using my
other brow quad in my kit when I bring
it to school and stuff so I just don't
want to have to keep taking it in and
out so I've just been putting this in
there and using that lately this is
Anastasia honest hacia Beverly Hills
clear brow gel i love this this is great
this is the Milani brow and I
highlighter one as a cream side and one
is a shimmer side I've been using this
just to kind of define underneath my
brow if I'm not using the bowling one I
don't use this all the time but I just
like to have it handy just in case and
then I have to brow pencils here this is
the Anasazi eyebrow was in the shade
dark brown something insane yeah I got
this in a kit so that's why it's in that
color so that's that and then I also
have this clinique I pencil which I just
got it's an
brought one in the color soft blonde and
yeah so give me more of a natural look
or it can mix the two however I want to
do it so that's all the things in drawer
too now this is drawer 3 these are going
to be all of mostly just my eyeshadows
just straight-up eyeshadows I have my
color pop I shadow on the color lovely
i've been using this for my year-long
project pan so that's just in here so i
can easily get to it this is the josie
maran coconut water eyeshadow this is in
the color Rio de rose gold I love this
and I just like to have it in there when
I want to reach for it this is a steal
on mind palette it's all mad so I just
like to keep that in there if I need any
type of matte shade it's here for me and
it's not like a big deal and I just got
this palette as well so it's nice to
reach for it this palette I actually
made these are all to face shadows from
like different palettes that they've had
like the bonbon one and just different
ones like that so I just think these are
great like everyday neutral colors and I
just want to get some more wear out of
them I love this shade here it has just
a great mix I could just use this
palette but I have this one if I want to
bring from it so this is just a great
everyday whatever type of look I'm going
for I can do it with that palette and
then I decided to throw in three of
these quads from Maybelline now I have a
lot of these quads for Maybelline
because I went kind of crazy and bought
a ton of like limited edition ones and
stuff off of amazon as well as well as
all cosmetics wholesale so i just want
to get actual wear out of them i don't
think i've used nearly that many of them
like semi views but i want to just get
more aware of them they're great
drugstore eyeshadows and i think that
they do a great job in like putting the
colors together i think they're
interesting but still fun and it's
definitely still wearable so anyway this
first one is in the color desert fantasy
I thought this like Goldie green would
be so pretty and you could do like a
dark smokey eye or something I just
thought this be fun to play around with
the next one I have here is all of
martini I really love this duochrome
color there I just love the whole look
of this I think will look really good
for an eye look as well and then the
last one here is spirited sees this is
going to be so pretty we're going into
spring and summer we're in spring I
don't like you saying we're going into
we are in spring
and I just love the blues and that
bronzy brown as well as this like golden
cream I just think this will look really
good again altogether they do a great
job of picking those colors to really
just create a really finished I look
without being too crazy but still like
something interesting anyway I just do
those in here to use them up and get
some use out a lot this is the fourth
drawer here these are liners and
mascaras and just random type of stuff
like that if that makes sense these are
all of my Sephora glitter eyeliners I
got these in a son and I just like to
keep them in here in case I feel
inspired to use glitter they're here
ready to go and it just makes it easier
for me to do a look like that especially
on the inner corner I like that look
this is a next purple mascara I just
like this i've been using this a lot
lately either in my brows or on my
bottom lash line or whatever I just like
to have it in here again in case it
inspires me this is a stool eyeliner in
the color mint julep I just bought this
and I just want it in here because we
are going to be having some fun looks
and I love teal on the bottom lash line
or mint and this is perfect for doing
that this is my eve pearl liquid I pen
I'm just trying to use this up I've had
this for forever and it's still just
going strong I just like this in here in
case I want to do a cat eye this is the
Makeup Forever aqua eyes little mini
liner I'm just trying to use this up
it's in a year-long project so this is
the black liner I'm working on currently
to tightline wise and things like that
this is benefits roller lash mascara I'm
just trying to use this up i started the
sample whenever I got it when it like
pretty released as a sample anyway it's
okay i'm just using it up so that's just
the one I like to work on just one
that's the type of person I am I don't
like mix my mascaras really just stick
with the one this is steel as oscar fish
um I pencil and I'm just trying to use
this up as well and another project I'm
telling you again I'm sorry if that's
boring but that's truth I'm just trying
to use this guy up this is clinic bottom
lash mascara I have this in here just in
case I want to use it on my bottom
lashes I'm honestly not that into this
mascara it's just a little too wet for
me but I have let it dry out so I'm
going to reuse this and see if I like it
on the bottom
washes and then this is the lorac lesser
drops and gold I just am using this up
for the year so again if I feel inspired
