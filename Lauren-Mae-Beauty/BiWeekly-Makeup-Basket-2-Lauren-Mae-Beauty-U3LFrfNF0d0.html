channel this is going to be my bi-weekly
makeup basket number two this is the
second one I've done so i thought i
would just update you guys on what i am
going to be using for the next two weeks
or so and kind of my plans for them or
so I'm going to try filming this a
different way than last time in the
comments let me know if you like it
where you're just seeing the products in
the drawer if you like me like talking
about them and holding them up and
everything just let me know whatever
style you guys prefers 1 i'll do that
being said let's get into the products I
always have my mac fix+ so I will be
having this and sits on top of my muji
drawers because it doesn't fit inside of
them I like to use this for pigments if
I want them to be more foiled or even
just regular eyeshadows and then I also
sometimes use this if I feel like I got
a little powdery with my makeup so that
will be in there I'm gonna have my
number 7 beautifully matte foundation in
the color cool beige cool library cool
vanilla mm-hmm cool vanilla I always
have this basically on hand it's my
favorite foundation from the drugstore
just ever so I am going to have this
there but I don't think that I will use
it too much I'm gonna try not to but I
like to just have it in case I want to
use it this is the foundation I'm really
going to focus on this one is the mary
kay timewise matt where liquid
foundation this is in the color ivory
for this is a very light foundation i
kind of want to use it up before get too
tan and i will be using this in
conjunction with the tinted moisturizer
that i did not finish up in my finish
five by Cinco de Mayo so I'm going to
kind of be using these in the next two
weeks seeing if I can kind of finish
this one off and make some progress on
this one this one I think I'm almost
done with like it's really close so it
would be awesome to kind of finish these
at the same time and then have a new
kind of like foundation routine once
summer really hits us I'm going to be
using my baby skin primer I've been
making really good progress on this and
I'm kind of still deciding how i like to
wear it or how I like if I like how it
wears I'm still kind of deciding on that
it is nice i like the fact that it does
feel like it fills in my pores like it
smooths out my skin I just don't know if
it actually keeps me from getting oily
throughout the day which I
get claims to do but I feel like a
primer should do um but i also don't
feel like I look super oily so I don't
know if it just feels oily but doesn't
look oily I don't know I'm still
deciding on this but i will be using
this because i'm trying to use it up
this pixie ones also going to be there
it's in a project i just want to try to
finish this guy up i only have like four
uses are so left on it so it'll be in
there to use up this is the concealer
i'm using currently this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the color
fair I really like this and I'm going to
keep using it mostly use this for under
my eyes and a little bit of spot
concealing but if there is a spot that
is just a little too crazy I will use
this Boing concealer on it this is the
Boyne concealer in number one and I will
Pat this on there and I won't even use a
brush or anything I'll just Pat it and
then Pat around it to kind of blend it
and give it a little bit more coverage
over a blemish because I've been
breaking out so much lately but I'm
hoping it will subside now that I
shouldn't be stressed about not having a
job or anything like that kind of
getting more used to my surroundings and
living here so this is what I use for
like spot concealing though this is the
Maybelline fit me powder this is in the
color 135 creamy natural I did repress
this and I use this to set my under eye
concealer I really like it for that i
also like it on the face i love the way
this powder looks but it just doesn't
last throughout the day on me so i will
be just using this underneath my eyes
and I'm almost done with that so that's
exciting I have my bare minerals little
powder concealer in the color bisque in
there just to use in case I want to use
it up i have not been using this as much
as I should but I wanted in there
because I'm trying to use it up for the
year I want to be able to reach for it
powders for my face I have to this is a
Maybelline one this is a loose powder
shine-free loose powder in the color
light I've had this for a little bit it
was really cheap so i bought it and i
really i don't know i just pulled it out
the couple days ago and I've decided
that I'm going to try to use this up
because I did finish up my chart powder
i was using to set my whole face so i
thought i might as well give this one a
try and then i'm also going to keep my
Rimmel stay matte in there just because
this is like my favorite tried and true
one so I like to have this in there
jeez I'm going somewhere where I really
wanted to be mad I can put this on so in
my top drawer these are all the products
that are like face products in my top
drawer just to throw it out there i
guess i'll say that from now on but this
is Laura behind the scenes I primer I
just have this in there in case I want
to use it and started using like a cream
shadow as a primer but that's just
hanging out in there the last thing in
that drawer is the hourglass ambient
lighting palette and i will be using
mostly well all the powders but the
bronzer kind of color which is called
radiant light and as well as this
highlighting shade in the middle i
absolutely love called incandescent
light so those are in there and that's
all the things in my first door / on top
of it because some of these things don't
fit because they're too big so the
second or house is kind of like my other
face like color cosmetic face products
as well as my eyebrow things so for
blushes i'm keeping my bobby brown to my
bobby brown cheek palette in here the
first one is the Calypso cheek palette
and this is more Coralie colors and then
the second one here this is the pink
cheek palette and these are more like
pink colors like just classic pink ones
I just want to use these even more i
really like these and i used on just a
little bit when i first got them and
then I kind of got a lot of stuff I was
buying a lot of stuff and now I've kind
of slowed down on buying and I really
want to get back to using these in
trying these and loving me since I spent
a lot of money on them I'm going to be
having my what's up highlighter in here
this is in my project pan that's ending
the end of may so I want to try to get
some more use out of that item another
highlighter though that I have in there
this one is the bare minerals the 11 and
I was gonna get rid of this during my
clean out to clutter video but I just
couldn't do it so um I thought I would
try to get some use out of it and see
how much I really like it I think it's
so pretty and I am getting a little bit
darker which means I'm not really but
just a little just not as pale and so I
think this might look really nice and I
just want to give it a go I haven't
given it a fair shot on my skin so I
thought I would do that in this basket
I'm also keeping my trinitarian
no cheek blush in the color Neapolitan
lane because I just love it this is my
like go to blush if I don't know what to
wear more from doing crazy lip this
looks great I love it I love it I've
raved about this blush so much and it's
just perfect so I'm going to keep this
on there this will probably be in there
seriously every single week because it's
just one of those items that I want in
there to reach for in case I don't want
whatever else is in there like this one
I could always go to with any luck i
also have the Stila kitten highlighting
duo because i am trying to pin this for
the year so i have hit pan on the
lighter shade and i'm hoping to hit some
more pant on the golden shade now that
we're going in the summer and stuff so
that's going to be in there so I can
reach for it and then for a bronzer I
will be continuing to use my too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer which again has
was in my project sink finish five bison
go to my oh why can't I think of that
it's been in there and I have hit pan
and stuff so that's going to be in the
drawers so that i can try to finish that
one up get it finished off now the rest
of these are basically all brow products
or what i'll probably be using them for
I have my naked basics this is just the
regular one and I use that middle shade
for my brows for powder and I'm just
going to have that in there that's
probably the only reason I'll use it but
it is nice to have those matte shades in
case I want to use them floor brow
pencil i'm using the Clinique soft
blonde brow pencil because that's the
one I'm using right now I just bought
this it's okay it's not my favorite I
wouldn't repurchase it but I want to get
through it and I feel like it's gonna go
so fast like I wouldn't be surprised if
I finished that by the time the next
basket I upload the next basket video
this is the Ulta brow tint in the color
light I really like this product this is
an my monthly favorites for April and
I'm going to keep that in there to kind
of run through my brows whenever I feel
like they're a little too cool tone or
if I want to do something easier I also
have my clear brow gel by Anastasio
which I love and then I
I Anasazi brow was in here just because
of the spoolie i finished the product
but this movie is so good so it's also
in there still and that's everything for
drawer number to draw number three these
are going to be basically all the
eyeshadows yeah they're all like shadows
so I did choose to put any bit pallets
in my makeup basket for the next two
weeks just because I wanted to focus on
some smaller quads and give attention to
those I feel like they don't get enough
love for me so I thought this would be a
great opportunity for me to kind of put
those aside and focus on some other
things I haven't been using very much up
so this one is just in there because if
I want to use it it'll be in there this
is the color pops super shop eyeshadow
in the color lovely and this is just in
a project pan so or this is my project
pan for the year so I'm just trying to
use this up in the year and I just want
it in there in case I how the hankering
to use it this is the bare minerals
pigment eyeshadow in the color silk rose
this is a swatch of it there I thought
this would just be a great color to put
all over the lid and to just have a
really easy I look that also looks like
chic and put together now that I'm
starting work I will we have them to
make up every single day which I like to
do my makeup everyday I don't think of
it as something like I want to hurry and
get out the door I usually go
extravagant or a day but I thought this
would be a really great way to kind of
do something a little more simple so I
can maybe do a boulder lip or do a nude
lip whatever and try this one out I
think this I saved the shadow forming
too cluttered so I wanted to get some
use out of it and see how it looked I
think it'll really make my eyes look
super blue super pretty I really hope
that shadow works out the way I wanted
to I have three of the Maybelline quads
that I'm going to be kind of
experimenting with during this basket
the first one here is in the color
violet bolt I just I love violet colors
I thought this would be really pretty so
that one I want to try out this one's in
the color violet violet fems which these
are both these two were limited edition
ones but again you can get these off of
amazon and these are another like quanta
violet colors these are a little more
warm toned though and then I decided to
keep in here all of martini I did not
get the chance to play with this last
time I use
the other two for my last basket but not
this one so I thought I'd keep it in
there so I could use it and have a fun
look and then the last two things I have
in there for eyeshadows are these two
feasts like little round compacts so the
first one here this is the two-faced
natural beauty collection it has two
eyeshadows and a bronzer these on this
one is a very neutral one I thought I'd
be really pretty i just want to get more
use out of them the pigmentation on
these is oh so nice that one there that
really pretty hi i just love it i really
wanted to just get use out of them and i
really like to face shadows i think
they're some of the best ones out there
so want to use this up not up but i'm
gonna use this and then the other one is
this fairy one it's called pixie perfect
and I when I swatch this in my small
palette declutter I was just blown away
i thought the colors in here we're so
pretty and I thought why am I not using
that so I again thought this would be a
perfect opportunity to use this quad I
think it's so pretty the quality on this
is absolutely amazing and yeah I'm gonna
get some use out of it and do some
pretty looks so the next door are all
like liners and mascaras and those types
of eye products so or like regular
liners I have this Stila one in here
it's a convertible color in the color
lilac I believe yeah lilac I haven't
used this yet I didn't use it last time
but I wanted in there just in case I do
it might look nice with that silk rose
color this is the Stila oscar fish liner
again just try and use it up it's like a
brown bronze color I have my Elizabeth
Mont pearl eyeshadow stick which it's
just like a liner used on the inner
corners and kind of like just to
brighten up the inner like bottom lash
line as well so I have that in there to
use I didn't use it up during my finish
five nice to go to my oh so I'm still
just kind of working on it this is my
small little black eyeliner this is make
up forever aqua eyes in the color black
I'm just trying to use this up I'm
trying to ease up so many liners this
year so that is one of them I'm getting
close it's becoming a little nub and
then I
have my e / liquid liner in case I want
to do any cat eyes or anything that's in
there I also always keep these in there
these are all glitter liners these ones
are like a five pack from Sephora that I
got and I just like to put these in here
in case they feel inspired they were in
here last time they kind of just go in
there and this is just another gold one
this is from urban decay in the color
baked it's like a gold glitter so I have
those in there just in case I'm inspired
same with this next one um this is a
knicks colored mascara and
forget-me-nots it's like a purple color
I like to use this on like the bottom
lash line or if I want in my brows or
whatever I just like to have it in there
this is my lorac 3d liquid lustre in the
color cold I have this in there just in
case I can I have the inkling of Chinese
is up for the year all that's left in
here are mascaras so I have benefits
roller lash that I'm trying to work on I
have clinics bottom lash mascara and
then this one I just got in my Bella
voxbox video i will link that down below
and i'll link my original first make a
basket just in case you want to see it
down below as well but this is the rebel
kate moss broken heart mascara that's
what the wand looks like kind of crazy
I've been trying this one out I might do
a review on it let me know if you want
to see that um yeah because I think
these are like a dollar 79 on alt his
website and I think that's a really good
price but if you want me to do a review
on this let me know I thought I just so
it's in there because i forgot to put it
in this is my tart shimmering golden
beige cream eyeshadow i'm going to be
using this as like a primer and yeah
again it was in my finish man facing
good a mile and I didn't finish it up so
I'm just trying to work through that one
and still use it in my everyday routine
last but not least we have lip products
so whoo I have quite a few lip products
in here I have two of the tarte
lipsurgence ones i have the exposed one
which is actually a matte color i'll try
to watch that for you that's it there
it's really pretty like kylie jenner
nude color i really like this one and I
thought I'd get some use out of it this
is the one in glisten this is basically
sheer well it's like PG but it's like
really sheer I'm just trying to use it
up for the year so i thought i'd throw
here I have to face melted liquefied
lipstick in the color peony I have been
obsessed with the one in fuchsia I want
to get so many of these we sell this
these at my work so you know and we use
in my discount on these that's the
painting color um i just thought i would
put this in here i really like them i
have two glasses in here which I have
decided to ditch most my glosses um from
my project pans just if I don't like
them so I thought I'd use ones that I do
like this is the marvelous Moxie one
from bareMinerals in the color rubble
it's just a mini and this is the buxom
one and white russian so i thought i'd
throw those in there I have two NARS
pencils in here this one is in the color
I bear co I don't know it's ibe r.i.c.o
it's really pretty red but like a really
warm orangi red color that's it there
sorry for my swatches it's really
beautiful I wore this the other day and
I just love it it makes my eyes so blue
it's beautiful and then this one's a
little bit more neutral this is in the
color patina and I really like this one
as well I'll swatch it next to that it's
right next to it this one is really
pretty and I thought this one would be
nice if I want to do something more
neutral I have my Kat Von D little mini
lipstick in here just to try to keep
using that up I also have my Too Faced
lip injection little mini in there to
use up I have my Jordana easy liner for
lips in the color tawny this is in my
April favorite to absolutely love it
it's gonna probably always be in here
because I love this thing I decided to
keep this Kate Moss one that I got um
it's a rebel Kate Moss lipstick in the
color 33 I thought I'd keep it in there
just to maybe get some use out of it
although oh gosh awkwards watching
that's it there and I don't know how I
feel about the color yet so I thought
I'd keep it in here and see if I felt
courageous enough to wear it or you know
tried it on with a look or something two
more lip products that's it I promise um
I am gonna keep my Revlon juicy papaya
in there just to try to use it up
because I want to use it up for the year
or me maybe for the I think for the year
it could be for my project panel
her and then last but not least this is
the buxom lip I don't even know if these
are called full on lipstick this is a
matte lipstick and it's like minty it's
so pretty it's what i'm wearing on my
lips right now this is in the color Oh
dolly and that's it there again a very
new d-dark mom nude color very Kylie
