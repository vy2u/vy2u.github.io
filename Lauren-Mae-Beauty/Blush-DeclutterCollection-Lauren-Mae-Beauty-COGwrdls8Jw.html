are decluttering blushes today there's a
lot of stuff I'm really excited to do
this I have felt so empowered doing my
highlighters and bronzers getting rid of
things that I've held onto for quite a
while I'm really hoping I can make some
really good progress on my blushes
because something I've learned is that
um I love blushes but also I love the
same blushes like I can use the same
like tonal blushes I don't need a bunch
of different colors for my personal self
and for my kids I usually use like a
palette maybe two different ones so I
don't need to keep a ton of stuff for my
kit either that's not like realistic for
what I actually know I use and do on set
so I am excited I'm really hoping we can
make some good progress fingers crossed
guys if you haven't seen my other two
colors I'll leave a link down below and
also yeah you can watch all this glamour
there I'm just going to get into it I
don't want to explain everything 500
times we're going to start off with
laura geller blushes you guys know
they're like my favorite so this
probably won't be a ton of getting rid
of but these are like the ones I love
the most but I thought not laura geller
this is our gloss and I actually like
using this in my kit really really
pretty colors it's just that like
original one that came out this is great
if you're looking for just like a little
bit of color you want something more
like natural really like it so I am
going to be keeping that for my kids
this is the Laura Geller blush in
bora-bora I love that I hit pan on this
I'm keeping that I love it I'll be
swatches of it so that's it there if you
can see this is the blush in Sun flip it
is very very shimmery this one I think
I'm gonna pass on that it's kind of more
like a highlighter it's a little too
dark to actually highlight I just don't
think I'm going to use this time to pack
that one on we'll have our pads on pile
here this is the blush in voice' vary
and it's actually on that one I think
this is so pretty
I like this all the time but install
thing is especially pretty so I will be
keeping that this is one that I really
like it's a newer one for me this is
tropic use this is one of their like
permanent blushes and it just has a nice
bit of shimmer not like overly shimmery
have a little bit of Sheerness to it
it's kind of a mix between boysenberry
and Bora Bora actually so I'm going to
keep that this is the base flambe blush
in the color peach crumble again
super pretty I just I really like baked
stuff I know so many people love like
the idea of the most pigmented blushes
in the world but that's definitely not
my style I like something I can share
out I don't have to worry about like
looking crazy with and yeah love this
keeping that this one actually got sent
over to me from autumn this is in pink
grapefruit and it's really pretty it's
kind of more of like a nudie color
unlike I'm keeping and then last year
this is the baked heart blush and
highlighter in pink Valentine I'm going
to just rub them together this is quite
intense but I kind of like it
so I'm going to keep that one up it
swirls but you could just do the
highlighter if you wanted which is there
you could just do the blush this one's
definitely a bit more like you know
house like a golden shift to it which I
do like I'm going to keep it well I got
rid of one laura geller blush didn't
know if I'd be able to do that I didn't
want to like be like oil or Bella
blushes I'm cheap and although I really
want to like look at individual colors
because it's not about a brand or a
formula it's about like all of it you
know like it is a brand the formula and
the color and do I use it perfect but if
it's not even if it's a Wardell or
blushes I mean achieve it so let's move
on to this one since it's right here
wants to do this we can do this one it's
okay okay this is a blush from lay
immersed a murmur I don't know gosh dang
it a try so usually I name a try I'll
have it in the description box
I am panning this right now I'm trying
to like get rid of the face it's just a
light pink like blush it's Mac it's not
my favorite but I got it in France with
Sam so I will be keeping that this one
is sentimental it's pretty and I am
trying to get use out of it another
laura geller thing I just got this this
is a big old disc really really pretty I
am going to be keeping that I think this
is actually great for my kids
potentially or for myself and it's newer
it's my type of product and the thing I
like to do so
I'm going to keep that I have these two
blushes from two-faced
they say something I bought a long time
ago I can't believe I spent 30 freaking
doll hairs on this this is just not in a
color that I would use it's SuperDuper
shimmery it has like sparkle throughout
so I'm going to actually get rid of this
which I'm kind of sad the packaging cute
and you know just reminds me of old
times man like beginning watching
YouTube and Bing so until all the makeup
and getting everything and as much as
like I hate that I bought so much it was
so fun time like there's no denying it's
fun buying makeup but I need to get rid
of it because I'm actually using it this
is something I bought like a couple like
a bit later after that word because I
like that one so much I did actually
like that one but I haven't really used
it but it is really pretty and it's nice
and sheer I don't know like I kind of
want to keep it and give it a chance but
it also has like glitter in it so I'm
just you're in it I don't think I'll
miss it I'm just going to get rid of it
don't overthink it I can count maybe
once that I've used that so I think it's
good I'm getting rid of it this is a
blush from benefit in rocket or I am try
and hit pan on this this year I'm doing
a good job I really like this I think
it's a really nice blush I highly
suggest it for anyone who very simple
with their blushes doesn't know what
they want doesn't want to have a ton
really really pretty it is shimmery but
it's not overly shimmery but have a
little bit of dimension I think it's a
good one I like this I'm keeping it this
is a blush for Michael Todd that I got
from all cosmetics wholesale I don't
think they even sell makeup anymore
it's a pretty color my hands wet so
nothing happened there but I'm going to
be getting rid of it just tool this is a
really pretty one from Maybelline again
it's just getting old so I need to go
but it's like look how pigmented it is
really pretty
um but yeah I'm going to get rid of that
so far I'm doing I'm doing well guys I'm
doing well dog did it did it did it by
myself
so that's my folks home anyway I have
some blushes here from Too Faced that I
got in a kid I think lot mmm maybe two
Christmases ago not sure I do really
like that
I almost have pan on it I'm gonna keep
that one that was a McCullar love
hangover disease - I haven't you a ton I
like that they're minis because it just
like I don't know I just like that about
them I don't feel overwhelmed they're
just tiny I don't know check one thing
I'm going to check that boysenberry one
from laura geller just to make sure it's
not like we were similar to this one on
the top because if it is I won't meet
that one oh yeah they're pretty similar
I just think I'll reach it out and I'm
going to get rid of that one and then
this one I don't really have anything
quite that bright and pink so I'm going
to keep it because sometimes I do like
to do a break pain especially when my
hair is purple so I'll keep that this is
your Eden minerals and this is really
pretty it just like peachy gosh it's not
like nudie peach very natural I'm going
to keep it I like this one definitely
like my style you know what I mean I
have three blushes from the balm
frat-boy
I know I'm going to keep because I think
this is a really nice blush it's just
super pretty
yeah I do like that one so I'll keep
frat boy for sure cabana boy is pretty
but I've never really used this ever in
my life again I feel like it's similar
to the boysenberry and I think I'll just
reach for that one over this I'm going
to get rid of that this is down boy this
is like a nice hot pink I'm going to put
this in the maybe pile I'm going to see
what other Pink's at have that are
similar to this this isn't something I
reach for all the time but I do want to
have a couple because sometimes it's
nice to have that like nice bright
powder pink so we'll do like a show off
at the end and see if there's anything
else that can eliminate this is from Eve
pearl and it's a trio I really do like
this I'm going to keep this I'm going to
try not to keep too many other like
nudie blushes I mean I'm going to
because of Lee my favorite but anyway I
am going to keep this and get some more
use out of it really great for like a
natural look this is like when I keep in
my personal collection we're doing a
fantastic job I'm really really proud
and the last thing in here is from Estee
Lauder and this is something I got when
me and Sam were traveling to California
before Latur so definitely old and it's
freaking great
I don't even know red orange I've kept
this for so long because it's something
like I only have it in this color and
like part of me wants to keep it to have
for darker skin tones but the type of
stuff I do I don't really need a blush
like this even if I am working on our
I'm not doing a ton of editorial work so
I'm going to pass this on I feel like by
the time I would even need that I
probably should have a new one in my
collection you know as in like time so I
can't hold on to anymore guys I'm going
to move all the ones I'm keeping back in
the box
I am really proud to help this present
you entertain you look at how good that
looks like I'm going to put this in
there for now but I'm very happy about
that I like to put it in half guys we'll
move on to some pallets really soft this
is something that's new and I use in my
kids from Tarte and I love it because it
has all these different blushes they
don't need to reach for a bunch of stuff
so I really love having this I'm keeping
that this is for NARS and I got this a
couple years ago wasn't last Christmas I
think it was like two three frames ago I
don't know why NARS uh these fricking
pallets totally sucked me in every time
I am going to keep this one I want to
finish up the live in a bronzer I do
like that bronzer these are pretty
blushes this highlight is psychotically
glittery so I won't use that and this is
too weird so I won't use that either but
I do want to like try to use this up
before I get rid of the palette so I'm
gonna keep this but yeah that I'm
getting a little old so that hopefully I
can work through that like this year or
next year something like that it's not
one that I would use in my kit though
this is the NARS gebe organ or however
you say it I was so excited to get this
I was so happy because I missed the one
before that was like the del Del Mar II
the del Hari I don't even know what the
Freak mouthal was called but had sit in
it and everyone had it everyone had it I
was so sad that I missed out on that one
so I was so happy the next year when
this one came out it was a joke getting
it oh I love it on yeah no I how many
times I may use this as force to myself
to use this every time I have I am going
to be getting rid of this it's getting
too old I would never use it in my kit
and yeah I don't use it on myself so I'm
going to be getting rid of that another
sad one
I actually was using this in my kit but
it's just getting too old and I hit pan
on the bronzer which I'm happy about
this is starting to crack I love the
shades in here these two are perfect to
like bring a pop of color to the face
and these ones are nice and nude so not
too much like I just feel like this
such a nice palette I love the formula I
got so much use out of this in the kit
but it's just getting old it's getting
kind of gross from like me sanitizing it
so much it's like ruining the packaging
so it's just time I'm sad I feel like
this is kind of the end of an era here -
is like the first like palette I think
they came out with like this is
off-the-cuff palette and then they just
like recreated this ever since they came
out with this so I am sad but it is time
it's time for this guy to go and then
this is a palette here with all of like
my personal like blushes and things that
have been be potted
I was hoping it to do better with it but
looking at it it's going to be a
difficult task I feel like I don't know
I really don't reach into this that much
but I don't know how much harm I'm doing
by just keeping it either this is like
peach nuance from Estee Lauder like part
of me feels are going to get rid of all
these and not even notice because I have
my other blushes so maybe I'll do that
yeah I'm kind of sad this one's so
pretty - Papa don't peach from Too Faced
with us old everything in here is a
little these are really nice
highlighters but again I don't need them
so I'm going to get rid of everything in
here I'm just going to trash it all wow
that's kind of crazy I'm just going to
take everything out of here so that we
can have it as like I'm getting rid of
the proof and then I don't know what I'm
going to do at this palette I feel so
like freed up these are nice these are
from bareMinerals
I feel like I'm starting to get into
like these like natural brands it's so
funny like bare minerals Jane Iredale I
always buxom suffragette I think just
weird or brands I feel like them so many
other people are like talking about our
youth anyway
this palette is now open and I can put
other stuff in it it's so pretty I love
this is like a custom-made one so pretty
super happy guys like this is crazy I'm
very I'm shocked by myself
okay I am going to moving on to
and this huge guy here see that the
things like oh my gosh you still have
all this war that's crazy yeah I know so
let's go through this step Wow start off
with some cream blushes I just have on
top this is from Smashbox I got this
when I did a Vanderpump shoot after
Smashbox Studios I'm going to keep this
as a cream product for my kit it's
really nice it's a pretty color I like
that smell something like insane and if
you want to have some cream products
again for my kit on hand so I'm going to
keep that this is something from miracle
skin and my mom loves this brand I've
given her quite a few things from it and
so I'm probably going to pass this along
to her as well she wants to try this
cream blush it's pretty I just I don't
know I prefer the Smashbox one and yeah
I don't want to have a ton of stuff just
to have it so you pass that on this is
another one from Smashbox this is the OH
glow cheek color I think it's like
supposed to change with your skin or
whatever I've never used this I kind of
want to see what it's like oh it's like
one of those silicon ones look and it's
like falling up no I getting rid of that
I don't know if it's like expired I
don't know what that's with that guy I'm
getting rid of it though like imagine
you just did someone's makeup and then
you go to like put on this cream blush
and it's just like peels everything away
and like destroys everything and you
hate yourself and you hate it okay this
is a blush from Dalton and I'm going to
keep it it's a cream one Michelle our
teamwork with Dalton products and their
brands like we they send us stuff that
we can use on our clients and stuff so
I'm going to keep this one it's a pretty
color again I'll have like a second
option for a cream board the last creams
watch I have here is from Stila and this
is in rose water I am also going to keep
this I bought this when I lived here so
it's not as old as it could be this is
just so pretty I love the formula of
this I love that it just breeds like the
softest tint like can you see that maybe
it's definitely not going to be too
intense a key to the do to the skin so
I'm going to be keeping this as well
this is a blush form Australis and it's
very pretty it's a really pretty like
nude color I just never
use it and I'm not going to use it so
I'm going to pass that on I have some
swatches here from Ben Nye and they're
pretty colors again but I have so many
blushes on Ebony's Ben Nye blushes so
I'm going to get rid of those Oh another
cream blush this I got from Heather from
love Heather edge she sent this over
I haven't tried this color pop blush out
actually so I'm going to keep this this
is something I'm just going to keep in
my personal collection obviously aside I
want to try this out maybe one of my
color pop like tutorial videos going to
keep that we have two blushes from
Milani I have luminoso from Milani which
is like an all-time favorite from people
and I used to really like this as well
but it is like too orange it's like
orange and it's very shimmery I'm not
going to use this I think other colors
would suit me better and my preference
and I'm not saying to go buy them but
this one just isn't me anymore and it's
so shimmery it literally looks like a
highlighter so I'm the Papa on this one
now I love this is the Milani blush in
rose romantic rose I love this blush I
love the color of it it's going to keep
it with us I have one lorac blush is a
lot of baked ones I don't believe they
make these anymore this is in the shade
Hollywood and it's beautiful it's super
shimmering like it's beautiful but I
just don't use it enough and yeah it's
not really my style I'm going to get rid
of it so much as I know I want to keep
my lover blush from Illamasqua I love
this so pretty such a great formula a
super pretty color everything about it I
love I also love this color of blush
from girl lactic in Milan it's like a
really pretty cool tone like dusty mauve
purple that's on my wet hand but such a
nice formula is such a pretty color it's
matte I love it I have a lot of tart
blushes so I'm going to go through those
really fast off the top I know I need to
get rid of these these are the Tarte
blushes in magic and fantastic these
were in like the first kit I ever got
like of all the little mini blushes and
the last two I've kept I've hit pan on
this one so pretty they are still nice
like I still like them it's the old
that's why I'm getting around because
they're just too old I don't feel
comfortable using along my face anymore
I shouldn't feel comfortable using them
all my face anymore is really what it
shows
I would never use a mic hit ever ever
ever it's just I'm so yeah I'm sad that
they gotta go now these are the ones
that are left I love these two this is
the tarte exposed i have the old
packaging so it's definitely an older
blush i would love your replacement soon
but I still really like it I'm going to
keep it this is my Tarte tartlet
celebrated um blush I also really love
this the color that's beautiful yeah
I've used this one quite a bit as well
it almost looks like nothing that it's
beautiful
and then on to before many blushes I've
had I've gotten rid of so many of these
over the years but let's see this one's
pretty but it has hardpan so I'm going
to get rid of that
that one's in the color ethic this one
in classic is really beautiful I'm going
to keep that one this one also is super
pretty I'm going to keep it in ecstatic
and then last here this is the one I got
from the birthday kit and from the
birthday gift from Sephora this is the
color part egg to keep that really like
that actually I think that's like one of
I feel like this year's gift was like
the best gift we've ever gotten at least
for my face I really liked it I have
some blush palette here these are really
nice I do like them I don't know
okay let's go get them this one's from
Becca I was keeping this in my kit and
beautiful I love it I think I might take
it out of my kit for a little bit and
try to get some use out of it on myself
but they're super pigmented super pretty
so I'm going to keep the afterglow
palette these are from Sephora and
Pantone I just like these two guys so
this one is one marks all over the color
of the year I'm going to keep it I think
it's so pretty I love the highlighter in
these even though it's a same
highlighter it is a really pretty
highlighter I've obviously hit pan on
this one I love this one here this blush
that's in the palette this one I don't
use that much but I mean it's just part
of the palette some to keep it yeah I'm
gonna keep these I have two number seven
blushes I think I'm going to get rid of
both of these this one is really pretty
autumn also sent me this one and I've
used it couple of times and I think it's
nice but I just have the Tarte ones that
are very similar so I don't really need
this one plus this is like discontinued
I believe I try to look it up to like
link it in a video and I can
is so it's probably older I liked it I
like the color but I just have similar
colors and I don't think I would reach
for this one over those and then this
one I bought it's in the color soft
dancin it's pretty it's soft before the
line is nice like I like it but I just
don't think I need it
I don't know I'm represented in Jersey
maybe I'll decide between that in cabana
boy yeah I think that's on I do so I'll
put there maybe with cabana boy actually
let's just do it now let's just do it
so that's cabana boy and that's soft
dancin I think I'm actually going to
keep soft dancin and get rid of Caban
bloody divisions like a little more
powdery so yeah it's a little brighter
too but this is a blush from Mac this is
in the color film noir I have this to
contour deeper skin tones so this is
like a kit thing I am going to be
keeping that y'all know I love this as a
night arena Tarantino blush in the color
Neapolitan Lane beautiful like I love
this lush definitely keeping it this is
a blush from amazing cosmetics in the
color mucho mango and I really like this
I think I'm going to keep this - it's
one of like my brighter blushes and I
just like it I know it's older but um
I'm going to keep it for myself
we're left with clink and Bobby Brown Oh
a laura geller let me do that one this
one actually got recently and I bought
it mostly for my kit for like super skin
tones I think it's just so pretty like a
pop of really pretty color so I'm going
to keep that one I really want to get
maybe like a blush palette for deeper
skin tones just to have it I might want
to get one of those like julius places
ones if you have that and you like it
let me know I just thought that those
might be nice to have like then I won't
have to carry individual colors I'll
have some just in case but I don't run
into it enough where it's like you know
crazy I don't know let me know what you
think of those if you have a climbing I
love the clinic chica pop blushes I
think they're so nice I love the formula
I love the way they look on the skin
this is the color nude I've obviously
use this the most I'm keeping that this
is the color
koulikov I'm going to keep this as well
it did quite dark I really want to do it
I'll work with
I think if you want to see that let me
know I just think it'd be so pretty like
a one shadow all over the I smoked out
looking like kind of like vampire I
don't know I'm just into it I think it's
so great okay these two are so similar
this one is peach pop and this one is
ginger pop I'm just watching next to
each other I just don't feel like I need
both I mean I guess okay where they look
a little different but in a very very
similar I don't know I mean I guess
they're different I'm going to keep both
for now and then use them and if there
isn't like a big difference on the
cheeks like of using them then I'm going
to get rid of one or the other and this
is plum pop so great I love this one too
this is like my bright color so and then
last here I have my Bobbi Brown palette
I use these in my kit so I don't really
use these by myself this one is either
limited edition and this is the color
the very cheek palette really really
pretty
the pink palette is like cool tongue
seen the two outside are matte in the
one in the middle of shimmery and then
this is the Calypso one it's like corals
really pretty I really like these
blushes they just blend really nicely
they look almost kind of powdery but
they blend really nicely onto the skin
they're pigmented stopping to pigment in
it I really do like them so I will be
keeping those okay guys how money a
movie come back and we'll see what I all
got rid of so these are most of my
blushes is like a lot of them you know
whatever but it's not as overflowing
there's quite a bit in there then I have
these are just like my cream ones that I
have left
I have my palette they were just like on
their own because there wasn't it speaks
for them in something so I have my
palettes here and then I guess I'm Laura
Geller ones here I'm going to try to
find a way to like condense these into
the other container so that way I don't
have to have the extra one and then the
most exciting thing guys I'm getting rid
of all of these blushes I'm going to
count them up right now including the
pan because I think that as much as it
just pans super still a success so I'm
going to count these up and let you know
