Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing a tag video
this is something that I should have
done a while ago it's been a while since
it came out this is a tag created by
Danny Bo as well as Natisha n so I'm
gonna leave them both link down below
they did a collab video and came up with
the blushes bay tag I was tagged in this
a while ago and I feel bad but it's the
perfect video to film while I'm away and
Italy this video should be up while I'm
in Italy so this is all pre-recorded
stuff but if you guys want to follow me
on Instagram I'm going to be trying to
do some Instagram stories showing you
guys where I'm at also you can see
pictures and kind of keep up with me
more in real time there but anyway you
know just had to throw that one in there
so I hope you guys enjoy the tag let's
talk about some blushes there
inspiration from this was kind of the
old blush tag but then they added some
of their own twist on it and I did do
the old blush tag so I'm gonna leave
that link down below I haven't watched
it so I don't know how different my
blush choices are gonna be but I think
that will be interesting maybe I'll
watch it back a little later also with
that I'm gonna link my old blush to
cutter because I think that more than
anything something that I realized as I
was going through my blushes with this
one I realized that a lot of the blushes
I have are older things that I've had
for a long time and I've just declutter
Dalat so a lot has gone away and you can
kind of see where I started with my
blush collection so I'm gonna leave
maybe all my blush declutter so you can
kind of see the evolution of it all but
all that being said this is kind of long
tag it has 15 questions so check out
their videos go show them some love and
let's get into the blushes Bay attack
the first question is cream or powder
blush which do you prefer and I'm a
powder blush girl but I can I respect
the creams I understand why they're
there I think that you can get different
makeup looks with creams and if you have
drier skin or more mature skin I
definitely think that they can flatter
in ways that maybe powder doesn't so I
can appreciate both but in my daily life
of what I gravitate to what I'm excited
to use and what I use the most
are definitely in powder blushes number
two is what is the weirdest color blush
in your collection and I kind of have
two for this one I feel like I used to
have a lot more crazy color blushes
because I was kind of a collector and it
was like oh I don't have this color so
I'm gonna grab it you know
and I never really used them so I ended
up decluttering some but I think the
craziest one would have to be this one
from the Sephora Pantone universe rush
lustre cheek sweep it's funny Natisha
also had this in her collection she used
this for a different answer it was fun
seeing someone else have this palette
and this is the color radiant orchid
this came out when radiant orchid was
the color of the year with Sephora and
Pantone so I really love this palette
obviously I hit pan in a highlighter in
here I really use the other blush a lot
more than I do the radiant orchid but
that one's pretty dang crazy as much as
it's purple though I do think that it
kind of you know it works on the cheek
especially if you use a light hand and
then the other one I wanted to mention
is just one that's really vibrant I got
this in a boxycharm and this is from
pretty vulgar it's in the shade prim
vixen and this is a hot pink blush the
formula is really nice it does blend out
really nicely and you can you know go
more subtle and sheer or build it up and
go a little more crazy so that one's
pretty wild not in color but more of the
saturation of the color question number
three is do you prefer high-end or
drugstore blushes honestly I don't
really necessarily have a preference I
just like good stuff I would say when it
comes to my wallet what I like to pay
for our drugstore things but when I look
at my collection I will ajith Amenti
Road rug store blushes I have a couple
coming to me in that wet-and-wild kit so
I will have those I will probably have a
review of those up before I even post
this video but I just don't have them
and it's not because I don't want to buy
them honestly in the last year and a
half I really haven't bought that many
blushes I haven't brought that much new
into my collection most of the new
blushes that I have have come somehow
via PR or sent to me from the brands and
so with my de clutters I've gotten rid
of a lot of things that I haven't used
and the things that I have here are
mostly high-end so I would say in theory
I like drugstore / whatever works but in
my actual collection right now I only
have high-end blushes so yeah kind of a
long explanation for a short little
question right moving on to number four
what is the most expensive blush in your
collection I feel like most of mine
in a very similar price range but this
by far kind of beats everything out this
is from Kevyn Aucoin and this is the neo
bronzer and it's in Capri cool pink this
is technically like a bronzer a blush
and a highlight but it's pretty small
compared to most palates and again it
was just the one that was the most
expensive this retails for $58 I was
lucky enough to get this sent to me from
the brand through octa Lee and I like it
okay it's not my favorite honestly I
think the pink in the middle is just not
my favorite type of pink for blush I
like something that's a little bit more
cool toned or something that's a little
bit more peachy not something that's
kind of like right in the middle I feel
like this is like the classic pink blush
and that's not my favorite color
so yeah that's my most expensive and you
guessed it number five is what is your
most inexpensive blush and because I
don't have any drugs for blushes here I
feel like that was kind of hard for me
honestly again they're kind of all in a
very similar price range but I decided
to pick something that we all got for
free that's my most inexpensive this is
the Tarte blush in party this is one of
the options for this for birthday gift I
believe in 2017 and it's one of my
favorite blushes so obviously if I get
PR that is sent to me and I got it
technically for free but I thought
putting in something that we all could
have got for free was again you know a
little twist on this flippin and yeah so
the Tarte party blush I love it it's so
beautiful yeah it's great a lot of
people like this blush number six what
is your favorite blush single I feel
like if you've been with my channel for
a while you probably can guess this but
out of the colors that I have I really
do like benefits rocket or it's my
favorite one
I have pan on this I use it all the time
it's a great one that will go with any
look that you have going on it's not too
warm it's not too cool it's not too
highly metallic but it's not matte I
just find that this works with like
everything I like that it's a sheer
buildable formula so you can kind of be
you know kind of reckless with it as
you're getting ready in the morning you
don't feel like you have to put all your
concentration into putting your blush on
or you're gonna screw up your look and
you're just you know screwed I would say
that's definitely my favorite one and
the one I use the most out of the
blushes in my collection next is number
seven and this is favorite blush palette
now I was looking at my
and only in terms of the items that are
my own instead of things I use in my kit
because I tend to use pallets more in my
kit because they work for multiple
people and multiple skin tones or
multiple looks but when I was looking
through my collection these are the
things that kind of like struck out to
me or stirred out to me yeah stood out
to me for this
question and these are from Bobby Brown
these were part of a limited edition
release I believe in 2015 and so I just
love these I thought these are really
well put together
I think they retails for like $45 which
is super expensive looking back now I
probably wouldn't have purchased them
but I do like the Bobby Brown formula so
this one is in the shade Calypso and
this is probably my favorite one because
again it has those warm shades and these
all have to mattes and then a shimmer
blush in the center this one here is a
little bit deeper so it'd be a beautiful
on darker skin tones this is the Barry
cheek palette and then last there's like
this cool toned baby pink one which is
called the pink cheek palette so these
ones I just I think they're really nice
I feel like they're compact they put a
lot in here and they're actually like
good options for blushes so out of
everything I have that's the one I guess
I'll go with my favorite blush palette
although I do wish I use them more than
I do alright question 8 is oldest blush
in your collection um and this is kind
of difficult because I feel like again
mine are all very similar in age they're
all kind of I like to use when I moved
to California from Arizona as like a
determining factor of how old things are
because I know I've been here about
three a little over three years now so
if I got anything before that I know
it's like getting up there in age and so
something that kind of sticks out to me
are the support and Pantone universe
palettes I know that these came out when
I was still in Arizona and I do have the
Marsala one as well actually and I but I
think this one was the original one they
don't do these anymore
I never see really anyone talk about him
I think that's why I was like so happy
to see Natisha have hers because it's a
beautiful palette and I kind of wish
they continued to do it but I guess as
things were like I don't know the
emerald color can't really make like a
blush palette I guess with that color
yeah they could they could get creative
I don't know anyway this one's pretty
old in my collection but so are some
other things along with that one number
nine is what is the newest blush in your
collection and as I'm filming this video
right now the newest blush to me is from
ciate London and this is the shade a
baby doll these are kind of a glowy
blush so they have a bit of a shimmer to
them but they do have a lot of pigment
it's not like a blush topper or a
highlighter that's you know in a
different color so that's a little
swatch of it really really pretty just
kind of a classic color I think that
there's one called summer love maybe
that's a bit more peachy and I think
that one would be beautiful this one was
sent to me which I'm appreciative of and
I definitely need to try it out a little
bit more to give you guys a review on it
but I I have been enjoying it the times
I've used it number 10
what's your party blush I believe this
was from the original tag and how I
interpret this question because there's
a lot of different ways that you can is
what blush are you gonna wear - if
you're going to an event or going out or
doing something you know kind of out
there and for me I want to wear
something that I know I look freaking
hot in that I know is gonna look good
with my look that's gonna blend out easy
a tried-and-true product and also
something that's going to be kind of
neutral that kind of goes with
everything unless I'm doing a specific
look a lot of the times when I'm going
out I just want to feel beautiful and
that usually tends to be in a look that
I've tried multiple times so with all
that explanation I have two different
options here for you I'm going to start
with the older one in my collection this
is a limited edition Tarte blush in the
color celebrated and it looks like
nothing in the packaging it looks like
will that even show up but on the cheeks
it just gives the perfect amount of like
warmth and color without taking over a
look if you go really heavy with your
eyes this is gonna look really pretty if
you do something simple this is going to
complement it really well too so I love
this one but you can't get it anymore so
sorry about that I told you with my
stuff sold y'all and then more recently
is a blush from Oprah I got this sent to
me from gopher through octa Lee and I
you really really like it this is the
one I've been wearing to the parties
that I've been going to probably since I
got it really it's a beautiful matte
blush and I just I love warm peachy
tones on my skin I think that they go
with every single eye look I'm not
someone who does like a cool toned blush
with a cool toned I look I like bringing
that warmth to my face no matter what
kind of ilyich I do so to me peachy
colors are a neutral and this one's just
really nice I'm wearing it on my cheeks
today and I really enjoy it so those
would be my two party blushes because it
just feels so comfortable in them and I
know they're gonna look good
number eleven what are some brands that
you have four or more whether it's the
brand itself or a specific line of
blushes which one you have four or more
of and I only have two that I have four
or more of the first one all right laura
geller blushes I have a lot of these
let's see I have seven of them I've
since too cluttered like one of them
which was in my last two clutter I
really like these I don't think they get
enough love here on YouTube baked
products in general don't get enough
love but I think these are absolutely
stunning this one has like a heart in
the middle it's a little bit more of a
glowy blush this is a shade pink
grapefruit which has a glow as well
this is one that's a little bit
different I really like it it is the
shade cherry truffle and this one's
really great for a berry blush in the
winter I would say overall my favorite
is this one it's called Bora Bora and
it's a nice like peachy subtle color
it's beautiful
so obviously I really love those blushes
and then the other brand that I have are
the Clinique cheek pop blushes I have
four of them here I think that I used to
have like five or six of them at one
point and these are so beautiful I love
the finish of these on the skin they
give a nice like satin look again
nothing too shimmery but they aren't a
matte they just look like skin so I have
a really nice brighter peach my favorite
one is the nude one because it's a nude
and it goes with everything I really
loved plum pop this one is so beautiful
and a lot of the times when I do a
really pink look I gravitate to this and
put it on the eyes put it on my nose
just put it everywhere this is the shade
Cola pop and it's definitely a bit
deeper it's beautiful though really love
that I've done
I look with this blush before I believe
it linked it's pretty old though so
sorry if the quality is bad I don't even
know if my quality is not much better
now anyway so those are the brands that
have four or more of number twelve is do
you have any blush buying regrets I have
one blush in my collection currently
that I do regret fine if I could go back
I wouldn't have made this purchase and
this is from a pearl it's the blush trio
in sweet cheeks and it's the light
version I don't really know much about
eath pearl I got this off of hautelook I
know I had heard like a few things about
their salmon concealer I bought an
eyeliner pencil at the time and I bought
this because it looks so pretty and the
colors are you would think they're right
up my alley they're like warmer you know
soft colors but I never reach for this I
hate the size of the pans you can't
really get a blush brush in here I end
up just swirling everything together but
then there's plastic pieces in the
middle I just I don't reach for this
enough I probably should declutter it
it's just something that's been hard for
me to let go for whatever reason and
then other than that just in general I
think overall with my collection in its
entirety but specifically with blushes
and where I'm at now
I really regret just being a collector
I'm getting every shade of a collection
just because I like that formula for
example the Milani like rose blushes I
loved romantic rose I think that's what
it was the one that's the most popular
and I loved that one so I bought like
two other ones and of course I was
pining after all the other variations
that came out but I never used the other
ones ever I only used romantic rose
because I liked that one
and I think something with me is just
like not trying to collect everything
just to have it just to like be your own
store instead just being satisfied and
okay with having that one color that
works for me and not needing the rest of
the line same with like trying to get
every color of the rainbow when it comes
to blush it's like I'm okay right now
with liking peaches and nudes and like
Mavi colors that's what I like that's
what I wear and I'm okay with even
having multiple of those colors I'd
rather have multiples of those than
having a red and a purple and a you know
really hot Orange that I never used but
have just in case you know what I mean
I'd rather have more of what I actually
use and I'm not sure
of being a peach lovin blush girl okay
but yeah those are just some of my
regrets that I've had after like
collecting for years now and just kind
of decluttering and getting rid of
things also blush takes forever to
freakin use up so I try not to have too
much in my collection and if I bring
something new in maybe pass something
else along so other people can use it
because I tend to stick with my blushes
the most out of my collection like I
will use a blush every single day
whereas I will switch up my eyeshadows I
will even switch up my bronzer more than
I do my blush moving on let's go to
number 13 this is a blush you purchase
because of a youtuber so there's really
only one that I can think of for this
and this is an oldie but a goodie this
one's pretty old as well I definitely
bought this when I lived in Arizona and
I bought this one Illamasqua was still
sold at Sephora so you know it's old
this is the blush in lover and I
remember makeup by Ali she loved this
blush she talked about all the time and
so from that video I was like I want
that blush too it's so pretty it's so
different this is the softest blush I
have ever felt it's so like so velvety
soft I love it so much this is something
I use a lot it's very similar to Oprah's
Bellini I find this one just has a bit
more of a vibrancy to it but I love it
it's something I probably won't really
ever declutter unless it like goes off
because it's something I just enjoy I
love the color it's orange but it's soft
and still wearable we are so close guys
question number fourteen is there a
blush from a brand you haven't tried
that's on your wish list I have two here
I did a high-end and a drugstore brand
so one on my wish list for awhile now is
the Marc Jacobs air blush in flesh and
fantasy this is like the lightest one I
believe out of the six or so that are
available I just think this is so pretty
I love it packaging I think the color
looks nice I've only heard really
amazing things so it's on my like luxury
wishlist like in the future at some
point and then the other blush on my
wish list that I've had on it for just
as long I really wanted this blush is
from covergirl it's one of their true
blend baked blushes it's like marbled
and I remember high
I remember seeing this and just look so
pretty there's three different colors
and honestly all of them look beautiful
I think I'd go with the lightest one I
think that Taylor really likes it too so
that kind of like made me want it even
more but just the way that one looks
just intrigues me and it's something
that's been on my wish list for a while
now and last we're gonna talk about some
blush brushes so this is what are your
favorite blush brushes and I am a simple
girl I just need my Sigma large angled
f40 brush I love this so much this is
what I use all the time and then this is
a cheaper option just to give you guys
in its from AOA studio which is the shop
miss a brand but it's very similar it's
an angled blush brush I love an angled
blush brush boom boom boom done boom
boom boom tap and blend tap and blend
and you're good to go so that's all I
need
that's all I use right now maybe at some
point in the future I will change but
it's been a good five six years strung
with these types of brushes so yeah
alright guys so that is the blushes BAE
tag let me know what some of your
favorite blushes are in the comments or
if you think there's a blush that I
might really like cuz of all of the
blushes in this video let me know as
well I might have to check it out also
if your creator and you want to make a
video with this tag do it and let them
know that you made it I love doing tags
first off and I think it's so cool that
they created their own and kind of put
their own spin on this plus I think the
names cute so you know anyway that's
everything guys I hope you're having an
amazing day and I will see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
