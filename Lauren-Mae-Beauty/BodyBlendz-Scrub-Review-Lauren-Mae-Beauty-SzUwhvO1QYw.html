Lauren I have a review today on the body
blend oats oats baby body scrub now I
was sent this for PR and I've been
trying it out so i thought i would let
you guys know how I felt about it what I
thought some things about the brand as
well as some pros and cons and let you
guys know what my overall opinion is so
I thought I would start off with a few
things about the brand it is an
australian brand it started in 2014 and
they're kind of mission statement their
goal is to produce high-quality really
great ingredients products at a low
price so all their stuff uses only
natural ingredients its paraben free it
has no artificial colors and that's
something that i really like about this
brand I feel like if you can get as
natural as possible that's always a
positive especially if the product still
works and is really nice all the scripts
in their line have the arabica being in
it which is like a coffee bean so I
believe all of them have that as their
base and it's supposed to help fight
cellulite it's supposed to help with
stretch marks it's supposed to help with
acne as well as eczema so not only is it
supposed to be just like a nice scrub
but it is supposed to have those
benefits to it as well for a few like
product details this is 200 grams and on
the website if you were to buy this it's
1949 and then they also offer a
subscription service so if you do that
it would be 1495 a month they have three
other options of scrubs on the website
besides the oats oats baby there's like
a coconut one I think a sugar scrub one
and one other you can also choose to do
like a deal with all four of the scrubs
plus a mint for like $77 now I feel like
that's a little bit pricey although it
is nice you're getting the natural
ingredients and there is quite a bit of
product in here at the same time one of
my favorite scrubs is the licious scrub
and that scripts like thirty-five
dollars for a jar of it so 1495 you did
the subscription or even just 20 is
definitely cheaper than that plus they
always have some type of code so if you
go to the website there's a code I also
have one listed down below it's YouTube
20 you'll get twenty percent off at
checkout I don't get anything off of
that it's just a code for you guys to
save money so definitely make sure if
you shop on this website that you you
have a code of some sort out there you
definitely should be able to find one
one last thing they do
worldwide free worldwide shipping on all
their products so that's something
that's really awesome no matter where
you are you can get free shipping that's
always nice not all companies do that so
I've used this a couple times now and I
definitely think I have a good opinion
on it I have some pros some cons overall
though I really do like this product I
think it works really well you're
supposed to use it two to three times a
week to get like those benefits of the
cellulite and with the stretch marks I
feel like in general with anything that
has this claims it takes a lot of time
to really use the product to see results
like that so that's not something that I
hold against this product for not saying
because it has the caffeine from the
coffee I definitely think that it has
the potential to help with cellulite
because that's one of the things that
helps what cellulite is caffeine let's
talk about some pros and things I really
like about this I already mentioned I
like that it has like more natural
ingredients I think that's really nice
if you're gonna be putting that on your
body and because you get to like scoop
out whatever you want and it's just a
dry ingredients inside the bag you can
kind of choose your exfoliation level
you can just go straight on with like a
scoop of this onto your what skin and
start buffing you could put this into
your shower gel as little or as much as
you want to kind of get whatever level
of exfoliation you really like another
great thing is this definitely
exfoliates this is pretty intense I just
go straight on my skin and it's a very
intense scrub definitely gonna get your
skin ready for shaving or for self
tanning or anything like that definitely
has a great scrubbing power and with
that though it doesn't just leave your
skin like dry and raw afterward this has
extra virgin olive oil sweet almond oil
macadamia oil and oil that's inside so
once you're washing it off it really
does leave a nice moisturize feeling
it's a little bit of like this heavy
moisturize feeling but not in a bad way
and you guys know me I don't like
something that's too greasy feeling or
that just feels like yeah just gross or
like leaves a film this is just a nice
level of moisturization I like
cousin I don't feel like I need to put
lotion on where I get out of the shower
I feel like this is enough to like
replenish my skin after giving it a nice
scrub and then the other thing I really
like about it is just the fact that it
smells like coffee because it's coffee
grounds it has a nice talking aroma
which is nice it feels like you're at
Starbucks a few things to consider or
like cons I guess the smell of coffee is
really nice but that does stick on your
skin a little bit i had Sam smell me
when I got out of the shower last night
because I thought I could smell it I
can't smell it now but I thought I could
smell it and he could smell it too so
that's just something to consider it
does leave a little bit of that like
coffee scent behind which can be a
little weird or nice just depends on on
your preference although I love the
packaging because it's unique and I
don't know to me the packaging alone on
this was like yeah I want to try that
out I've never tried to scrub in like a
pouch it's kind of hard to get the
product out and because this is like a
dry product and you don't want to like
get water in it i just am sometimes
worried that the water will get in it or
that you know moisture will get inside
so this is definitely something i would
want to use up quite fast and you're not
supposed to leave it in the shower with
you just so it doesn't go bad i'm sure
with all the moisture so I feel like
maybe a tub could be a little bit better
a little bit easier but I'm sure having
it in a pouch also keeps the cost down
and then the last thing that it's just
something to consider when you're using
this is the fact that you do have to
clean out your tub after you use this so
the little granules are great because
they don't like dissolve in water if you
use like a sugar scrub you only have so
much time to exfoliate before the sugar
particles are completely dissolved and
there's nothing left with this because
it's coffee it does well it's coffee and
sea salt the sea salt dissolves but the
coffee grounds stay so you could scrub
all day long and it's still going to be
there but that also means that you do
have to take a little bit more time to
make sure that there aren't any like
speckles in your tub I did have to make
the extra time and effort just to like
clean out my tub so that's just like a
little bit of a different routine than
with other scripts that I've used
overall I think it's really nice I think
it's a little bit pricey but I do like
that it's more natural and I feel like
more natural products usually tend to be
a little more expensive I'm definitely
going to finish
this up and if I ran out of scrubs and
really needed something or was going to
get a gift for someone this is
definitely something i would consider
overall I do really like it and think
it's a good product I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and I will see you
guys in my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
