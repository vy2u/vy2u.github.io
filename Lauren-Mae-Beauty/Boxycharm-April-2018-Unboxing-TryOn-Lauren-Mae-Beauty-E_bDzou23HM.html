Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be unboxing my boxy
turn box I believe this is for the month
of April yeah yeah
April obviously I have nothing on my
face because I'm wanting to open this up
on camera I got this and showed it in my
last video I believe which was a PR haul
but that was all pre filmed and I'm back
today finally back from Oregon if you
guys follow me on Instagram you saw me
post just like one little post I'm not
very good at Instagram y'all well I
waited before I opened this because I
wanted to do the Tryon with you guys and
so that's what we're gonna do today I do
have a boxy charm like recap on the last
two boxes that I have got coming up soon
so just stay tuned to that I was gonna
post them on the same day but getting
back it just wasn't a possibility and I
don't know what my issue is with trying
to upload multiple videos on one day
like one video is hard enough a day why
do I try to like add multiple videos a
day I don't know but anyway this little
card we don't really care too much about
this but everyone's making a big deal of
how this is like a different thing than
normal this is the eye candy box or at
least that's the theme of this box I
know everyone was really excited so I am
excited to get in on top the first
things these are two brushes from the
brand oh they're boxycharm brushes Wow
okay so I'm really excited these are
very interesting so one of them is one
I'm really excited about because it is a
blending brush and it has like two
little jewels in it so that one should
be fun to use and then the other one is
pink with some pink rhinestones and kind
of just like a fluffy shader or
something so those seem really nice and
excited to get those especially that
blending brush because I talked about
that last time how I feel like you don't
really get blending brushes and I wish
you did so that one I'm excited about
something I'm so excited about is the
element of surprise palette from
colour-pop this is actually a palette I
really really wanted to buy and I just
kind of like held off on it and then it
kind of the newness of it and all that
went away so I am very excited that I
got it in the box I decided I didn't
want to purchase this anymore but I
would get it in my box etern box so I am
excited to try this
I loved the pink in it it has some fun
do Chrome's here so those are some of
the colors we are going to be playing
with that on the ice today next in here
I have a brow thing this is the brow gal
from Tanya crooks and it's the light
hair o3 tinted brow with microfibers so
I'm excited for that I really love a
good brow gel so I think this one
oh my wands all bent it's kind of weird
color wise it looks nice so I am willing
to try that out I was super excited to
see a Mac item in here this is the burnt
violet mac lipstick oh wow okay really
dark and deep looking looking deep I'm
gonna swatch it for you guys oh wow okay
really dark so interesting not the
normal formula or anything but I'm
excited to try that this is the lip
density lipstick and then the last item
in here is the pores no more from dr.
Brandt it's the vacuum cleaner pore
purifying mask so I'm willing to try
this out I wish it was the scrub I know
a lot of people got the scrub before I
started boxycharm and everyone raves
about it and says it's really great and
it's super expensive but I'm willing to
give the masks a try I'm just not very
good at making myself use them so
hopefully I can actually get to using it
oh wait oh I should do the mask now
that's kinda what I do in these Tryon
videos isn't it so I guess we're going
for it we're gonna be putting on the
mask I guess first oh I really don't you
guys will you forgive me if I don't do
this right now I just know my skin is
not ready for this right now we're not
doing it I'm sorry if that really bugs
you out but I will come back to you and
let you know what that's like I'm going
to be doing a like current skincare
video I have a couple of those where I
just give some like collective reviews
on things I've been using so that will
be coming soon and I will try that out a
couple times and let you know in that
video how it goes alright so that all
being said I'm gonna zoom us in and
we're gonna get started I think I'm
going to get my eyebrows on and then we
can move on to eyes because this is kind
of glittery and I don't want it to get
everywhere but let's zoom in first we
are nice and zoomed in I'm gonna go in
and fill in my eyebrows with the
covergirl brow pencil in taupe this is
something I've been trying out recently
and I like it pretty well so I'm going
to fill them in and then we'll come in
and do the brow gel
so I'm eyebrows on I find that when I
use that pencil they turn out kind of
skinny which is kind of cool but we're
going to move on to the brow product
that we got in the box again it's from
Tanya crooks and it's the brow bow yeah
we're gonna go for it I don't know why
the brush is like bent in there but it
was so I'm just going to be starting at
the outer portion of my brows because I
find a lot of times bullies can have too
much product and if you go into the
front it can really dampen the
application like it's just too much
product so I always start in the middle
and work to the tail and then go back
into the front portion with less product
on my spoolie so far I think it looks
pretty nice it's a really nice and small
wand which I like so that's good and I
like brushing my brow hairs up and kind
of giving them a wispy look so I think
this is doing a good job at that all
right so those are the brows done so far
so good I'll let you guys know as I
continue to use that product how I like
it I'm just gonna prime my lids I'm
using the covergirl one I'm sorry for
all the shadows on my eyes guys I'm
gonna be working on lighting now that I
have my new camera I know so many of you
guys like it which is amazing I'm so
happy and I also love how clear it is so
I'm excited to edit back this footage
all right so let's take a look at the
palette as you can see there aren't any
like matte cream shades this is a really
nice peach that we'll be using so I'm
going to actually set down my lid using
just a nice bright white and this smoked
palette from covergirl just cuz it's
what's next to me right now and I'm just
setting my like crease area and not
necessarily a ton on my lid because I
find that that covergirl primer is
pretty sticky which does help color and
like lid colors that have glitter stick
to it better which is kind of nice so
I'm just doing it where I really need to
for blending purposes so starting off
with the palette I'm gonna of course use
the pop of pink but I think I'm gonna do
kind of a purple on top like this purple
on top and the pink on the bottom that's
what I was thinking about anyway so I'm
going to go in first with this matte
peach shade it
is the color go with the flow I think
and I'm gonna be putting that into the
crease I know I haven't talked much
about the box but I really do like this
month's I think it came with a lot of
really great products and I'm excited
for this palette whereas the palette
last month I was excited for but y'all
know I didn't really like that palette
so this one I'm hoping will perform
better if you want a four looks one
palette with this let me know I'll try
to do it alright so I just buff that
really sloppily into the crease I'm
gonna go in with this shade here this
matte color which I believe is the shade
labyrinth and I'm just going to be
putting that also in the crease a little
bit lower
I feel like this Brown is turning a lot
more pink than I thought but it'll be
hard for me to give any opinions on this
look until I have my foundation on
because I really hate the way that my
eyes look done without foundation since
I have so much redness and tonal
variation it just I feel like I just
looked kind of like a mess until I get
everything put together and just for fun
we're gonna put another color in the
crease we're gonna go in with this kind
of like yellow brown and that is the
color see stars oh I have this shade
that is actually a color I already own
in a single shadow and we're just
bringing that also into the crease I
just feel like I wanted a little bit
more of something other than the pink
because that was what was really coming
out and I didn't want that oh my gosh
what is my problem I didn't use any of
the blending brushes I like lost the
brushes I can't find them why is this
video such a mess
I found the freaking brushes so sorry
guys sorry about that I'm gonna just
kind of buff out with a clean blending
brush the edges just so I can say I used
it you guys know though I always do come
back or I'm going to start because I
haven't technically done one yet but
come back and let you guys know what I
think of products after the box has been
used for a while
this one's really soft it's like
lightweight but I think it works well
I'm really happy about that
so I'm gonna take the shader brush which
is not normally what I would use but I'm
gonna use it for the sake of using it
for the box
I'm gonna spray it with some mac fix+
pretty heavily
just so that way I can really soak it
and get the color on the
brush and we're gonna be going in with
this purple shade it's called subdue and
I'm just going straight on with the mac
fix+ all over on that brush and we're
gonna put it straight on the lid I'm
using the other side that I didn't what
to pack on some more color and then I'm
gonna go in with my finger now and
really try to put the most color on the
center of the eye and the inner lid I
think that looks really really pretty
I'm really happy with how it turned out
considering I don't have any base on
underneath but I really do think the mac
fix+ is helping and I basically am like
almost liquefying my eyeshadow at this
point like that's how much products on
it just so you guys are aware next I'm
gonna go in with this darker purple on
the outer corner and we're just going to
kind of deepen up that outer portion of
the eye I definitely think you should
wait until the color is dry before you
go in so it doesn't stick weird and I'm
just going over where I put some of that
color the lighter purple on the lid and
just blending on top of it with that
berry shade and I'm bringing a little
bit through the crease but not too much
just enough to tie it in and to make
sure everything's blended I'm gonna be
going in with a mix of the this Brown
and the peach shade and just going over
the edges of those shadows and then just
to make sure I didn't lose anything on
the lid I'm going in with my finger once
again on the inner portion and just
stamping that on with my finger
for under the eye I think at first I'm
gonna go in with this brown shade the
light brown it's kind of like a rosy and
I'm gonna put that down first and kind
of buff it and now I'm gonna go in with
the brown the yellow brown sea stars I'm
gonna buff that as well and then I'm
gonna lightly buff this pink at first
and see where this goes on the bottom
lashline oh I should have done my
mascara you guys I'm a mess I'm a mess a
mess well I realized I might as well
just take off all that work so I'm gonna
clean up under my eyes do my foundation
do you want
stuff come back and we will get started
on the bottom lash line and do the lips
and stuff kale sorry guys sorry okay so
I had a minute did my face I'm like
feeling better I feel a little more
together let's move on to the lower lash
line
shall we actually this time I seriously
don't know what is wrong with me what is
my problem guys I did decide though to
switch it up so I'm gonna go in with the
peach first on a lower lash line really
just buffing that lightly and keeping it
toward the outer portion of the eye I
don't think I'm actually gonna use the
pink I know
Who am I I'm not sure I'm now going in
with seastars and kind of just going
over that again but keeping it even more
on the outer corner and then last I'm
going in with that berry shade the matte
berry we have on the outer corner and
just putting this on the very outer
portion and blending it up into the
outer corner for an inner corner I'm
gonna go in with this light shade here
it is the color feels I believe it's
like a duochrome glittery type of shade
I'm gonna be putting that on the inner
corner it doesn't do much so let's try
it with some mac fix+ oh yeah that kind
of brightens it up it's definitely has
that pink reflex and then for fun today
I'm going to be using that color also
for my highlight today so I'm gonna take
feels and just kind of dust it lightly
on my cheekbones a little bit down my
nose Cupid's bow I had some on my
temples and the Chinese bit on my chin
really fast off camera I'm gonna do my
mascara I'm going to do the white liner
and I'm gonna do the black liner on a
tight line and I will be back so we can
do the lips I'll show you the final look
and then I'll go over the items how much
they are if I think they were worth it
off of first impressions and then we'll
finish this video out so that is the
eyes done and we're gonna move on to the
lips now again this is the shade burnt
violet from Mac in the lip tensity
lipstick I probably wouldn't normally
pair these what like this lip and this
eye together but for the sake of this
video that's what we're doing it's very
dark
okay so I am going to try to go over my
lip line oh I think this is the best lip
that I can do so I'm gonna zoom us out
and I will show you the final look that
way with everything else on my face and
then I'm gonna go through the products
really fast and let you guys know what I
think
so let's go over the things in the Box I
do like the look it's a little bit more
vampy than I was kind of going for it
coz that lip alone I mean what else can
you do with it this is a $21 value and
although I'm super excited to get a Mac
product in here this is not something
that is like my favorite I don't like
the color in this formula it's a very
like lip balm feeling like comfortable
formula which is great but I just find
that I know that I would be worried all
day if this isn't gonna go over here go
over there so it's not my favorite I
wouldn't have purchased this I would
have liked this and more of like a
natural color or something a little bit
lighter just so it's not as easily to
just get everywhere I also found that
with this product with the way that it
applies it just is very like bulky and
it's hard to get a precise line and
since it's such a dark color that's
something you kinda need so am i happy
to get it yes would I purchased it no
it's okay it's okay next let's talk
about the color pop palette this is the
element of surprise you guys know that I
really like the eye look I came up with
I wanted this originally anyway so this
is an amazing value it retails for $16 I
did decide later on I wouldn't have
purchased this product so it probably
would have been something that never
came into my collection if it wasn't for
this box so that all being said I did
like this product I'm happy I have it
and this was great I'm really excited
for it next for the mask this is a forty
seven dollar value obviously I haven't
used it yet sorry guys I'll let you know
that is so expensive I just feel like
this is such a small amount of product
it's one ounce of product for forty
seven dollars so hopefully this is
really good
I think that getting a really high in
skincare brand like dr. Brandt is really
awesome to get in the box and I'm
excited to try this out so I think it's
a positive for now the brow gaol product
this is a $22 value which is pretty
expensive I'm excited to continue trying
this
this was really nice I feel like the
color matches my brows well I like that
these bully is so tiny I think it really
can get into your eyebrows and not go
everywhere and give you some precise
application while still doing the job so
I will be trying this other ways without
product with product and seeing how this
like holds my eyebrows throughout the
day so I do like this one a lot and last
we have the brushes and these are the
brush duo the ls miss glam brush duo so
maybe they're miss glam LS miss glam
mixed with boxycharm maybe they're not
boxy charms brushes the retail value on
this duo is 38 50 which is a big ol BS
laughs come on come on come on we all
know this is not $38 please homie please
this is like max this should be $10 for
these two these are really cheap feeling
even though little rhinestones are cheap
like you know I'm not saying these
aren't good brushes I really do like the
blending brush I think this one's really
nice but this one is like the same shape
I've gotten three times so far in the
boxes and I've gotten the boxes three
times so it's just kind of like don't
try to lie to me and say the value of
this is $38 because it's not it's not
$38 but I am glad to have the blending
brush in the mix I just hate when you
find that one product you know that's
like giving the Box its value but it's
like okay wink wink we get it overall
though I am very happy with this month's
box I really like the palette that's in
here and the fact that it is like a nice
performing palette so I'm excited just
alone for that I know that doesn't make
up the entire cost of the box but all
these other products to get to try out
for what is that six six dollars yeah
six more dollars to try out the rest of
those I think that's still a great value
so I am happy with this month's box and
I'm happy with the look I created so let
me know if you want to see anything in
here specifically in other videos sorry
it's too mess it's because I haven't
filmed in like five days and I don't
know what to do with myself and it's
like just different it's feeling a
little different than normal for me so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the video
let me know what you thought of this
month's boxycharm in the calm
and that's it thanks so much for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
