Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a very very
very very late boxycharm
unboxing for the month of May I have my
box here I haven't opened it up at all
so we're gonna go through this and how
I've been doing my box C terms is that I
go through it and show you guys what I
got but I also try it on
hence the bear face so I'm just gonna
dig straight in I'm sure a lot of you
guys have seen this because I know I
have tried so hard to avoid spoilers I
think I do know a couple of things in
here but overall I tried to be pretty
good about not really like watching it
but I don't know it's hard I'm still so
excited about what's gonna be in the box
let's open this thing up alright first
off we're back to the normal post cards
no more opening flaps this is the Boxee
bash box oh yeah okay so I think it's
like their birthday or something I think
it's the birthday one there's all these
birthday presents and cakes on end stuff
so yeah let's just get into the products
before we get too excited I'm so excited
already okay we'll start off with the
brushes because every single time I've
done an unboxing we've gotten brushes
and these ones look a little bit
different so first off there's this set
of three and these are all eye brushes
one is a spoolie one is like a liner
brush and then one is like an angle but
it's kind of big so those are kind of
interesting I think the liner brush
looks kind of promising actually and
then the spoolie is kind of nice to have
like just a separate spoolie and also
these are different than I feel like the
other brushes we've gotten in the boxes
before so at least if you didn't have a
big brush collection you would be
getting different brushes instead of
like the same ones but this other brush
is the one I'm excited about oh I'm like
bending it this one is like a big space
brush and it looks like a tapered brush
which is my thing so this is the other
one it's a nice tapered brush these are
from the brand Aesthetica and this is
the p12 it's soft it's kind of like
fluffy so we'll use this to probably
probably bronzer that's kind of what I
do with brushes like this so that's what
I will probably do with this looking at
the card the Aesthetica face brush
retails for twenty seven dollars and
then the other three brushes which are
from Aesthetica as well retail for 45
for the set
that is very pricey for those specific
brushes because they are kind of dinky
so I mean the face brush I can at least
kind of understand because it's like at
least it's beefier you know but yeah so
right there alone for a retail value are
$72 moving on let's pick out something
else from the box right here I have a
cover effects blurring primer I actually
have a many of this and I guess we'll
try this out again today I'm kind of
excited to see what it's like in the big
size and I think this might be something
I actually move into my kit after I use
it today so that one's really nice this
retails for $38 so far this is like my
favorite thing we've pulled out I think
it's a really great value for the box
it's something that I think a lot of
people could get a lot of value out of
so that's awesome next there was a
liquid lipstick in here this is the
matte lip gloss and it looks like it's
from the brand Beauty creations but then
it also has boxycharm on the top here so
I'm not sure not sure who this is but it
looks like a promising color if the
outside of the box is telling up the
inside which it is this is the shade
sweetheart number 17 has like a nice I
don't know is it bubblegum but then it
kind of isn't nice I don't know it's
okay so that's a swatch of it there
we'll see if it dries down as I open
other things the beauty creation so it's
from the brand Beauty creations it
retails for $10 I think that's a fair
price that one makes sense to me the
last thing on the top here is something
that is super duper cool oh shoot I
forgot I would need to do eyeliner today
mmm anyway I'll need to find a brush for
that oh I can use the brush we got oh my
god okay so this is from pretty vulgar
and it is the ink blacklist gel eyeliner
it's very interesting okay so I thought
this was gonna be like ink like one of
those cushions but it's just like a gel
in there so that's interesting this is
super heavy it almost feels like glass
it's super cool packaging I think pretty
vulgar does their packaging really
really well for their brand and like you
know the whole look of them this retails
for $24 I think that's a pretty good
price I thought this would be more just
because the packaging is so like extra
but we will be doing some gel liner
today and then I know that it looks like
there's nothing in here but I know that
there is a pallet in here it's another
pure pallet but this time we didn't get
an eye palette this month which I'm kind
of excited about I've been doing looks
with the other eye palettes and as much
as I liked one of them didn't like the
other I'm excited to just get something
other than an eyeshadow palette this is
the pure sculptor I have a few little
powders on the outside I hope none of
mine came broken
oh there's stickers on the outside why'd
you season a little razor to cut the
sticker instead of peeling it off all
right
none of its broken so we are successful
there this is a look at the palette so I
think this is pretty basic definitely
more cool toned but at the same time
these are pretty dark powders so we'll
see how these will work on my more fair
skin yeah I think that's kind of
exciting something a little bit
different for the box like I said
instead of it being an eye palette and
then this sculptor palette retails for
$30 and there is a code for 20% off your
cover effects order I'll leave that down
below and also 15% off pure so I will
leave that code down below just in case
you were shopping off the website I
don't think these are like one-time used
ones they're kind of like generic codes
so share that with y'all overall a ton
of stuff in this box so I am excited
let's just get into it
we're gonna start off with priming our
faces so we're gonna be using the blur
primer ooh
and this did dry matte and it's transfer
proof so that's great if you're into
liquid lipsticks I'm not the most into
them but you know it's still nice that
if it's a liquid lipstick that's
supposed to dry down matte but it
actually does that so I'm gonna be
putting the primer on my face I like
using this primer in like the center
where I have the most pores this is very
similar to me to the Make Up For Ever
smoothing primer so if you have that
this is similar I find that this does
like fill in pores and like smooth out
some texture but it's not - it still
spreads easy I guess but it's not going
to add like any moisture so if you have
any dry spots I don't feel like this
really helps or it can
times pick up those places so just be
aware of that I think the next product
we can use basically is the sculpting
palette so I'm going to do the rest of
my face up until that point and I will
be right back guys so I have my
foundation on I use the covergirl and
Olay simply ageless I talked about in a
video kind of recently that I had wanted
to pick this up again so I did it's
looking a little bit light on camera but
it's always so funny to me how things
translate because in person I feel like
this almost looks a little dark so yeah
I have that on this is in the shade 210
classic ivory as a concealer I use my
Maybelline fit me and fair and then I
used the AOA studio perfect setting
powder in the mat translucent to said it
all so we are ready for bronzer I'm
gonna Zuma sin no sorry guys
I won't Dumas in all the way up close
quite yet though just so that way we can
actually see what's going on when we're
adding this bronzer in contour okay so
we're gonna go in with the pur palette
and we're also gonna be taking the brush
I'm scared cuz these are really really
pigmented so I'm going to be very light
handed I'm just tapping in these kind of
smell I don't know kind of smelt like
chocolate and then it smell really gross
so I don't really know let's pray that
this isn't too intense and I like chop
off my brush on like a different area to
to like even get more powder off this is
a super fluffy brush I'm not sure how I
feel about this so far I'm not sure how
it's translating on camera but like to
me I feel almost like a little dirty or
something just because of the tone first
impressions on the color I don't really
like the color I feel like I look a
little like dead or dirty or something I
don't know it's just really really dark
and hard to control so I'm not a super
big fan so far I don't feel like it's
blended out poorly but I also will see
once I see the footage because sometimes
what I see in real life translates again
differently on camera brush wise I do
like it though this is something I
definitely want to keep using and kind
of playing with this is very floppy
though like a bit different than the
other ones I have that are similar to
this so I am really liking the brush I'm
gonna put a little blush on I'm gonna be
using the Tarte party blush you guys
know I'm trying to
Hanne on this so I'm really working hard
and now let's go in with the highlighter
I feel like the only one that might work
for me is this lighter shade here that's
called originator and I'm just gonna
take my normal highlighter brush and dip
that in and see what we get oh yeah
there is some shine to it I feel like
this is just barely light enough for my
skin so that's awesome and it definitely
has a lot of shine to it if you're
someone who wants a more like you know
blinding or metallic highlight I think
you would really like this so I'm gonna
have to play around with that
highlighter a little bit more in
different lighting whatnot to see if
it'll work for me overall though this is
not my favorite palette for my own skin
tone but I think it could work on a lot
of darker skin tones which is nice
we have some eye brushes to use as well
as the gel liner so I'm gonna put some
eyebrows on I'm gonna put a base I'll
look on so that we can put a little wing
on and then I won't be back okay so we
have some eyes on we're going pretty
intense tonight didn't expect that
exactly but okay we're gonna go in with
the gel liner I'm not oh my gosh and
just drop the lid I'm not sure if I want
to do like how much of a wing but we'll
just we'll see I'm gonna put a little
bit of this actually out on my hand and
work from that in case I want to use
this in my kit so it doesn't get
contaminated I'm using the brush we got
in the box and we're just gonna see if
we can create just a cutesy little wing
all right so we got one wing down I
think that looks pretty good this is a
super creamy eyeliner like it's like I
don't know if it's with the back of my
hand it's like heating up but it's not
like at all like thick it doesn't drag
it all so that's kind of nice we're
gonna hope to match the other eye all
right so that's the liner done I think
it looks pretty good I hope it's pretty
even fingers crossed but that's what
we're gonna do the brush was okay I
think I would prefer my Sigma one it's
like the eo5 or yo6 it's like a really
small winged liner brush really like it
when it comes to the eyeliner though I
think it worked well I think it was easy
to control and it was easy to like get
that inner portion really thin which was
nice and if you guys are wondering what
is on my eyes right now I'm using an
oldie but a goodie this is the Anastasia
tamanna palette and I used like Bengal I
used some of the shade the black I used
the dark brown that's mostly what I use
and then on my lid I'm using a pigment
from gorgeous cosmetics this is the
shade mousse and that's all over my lids
so we can use the other brush that we
have here I'm just going to go into a
couple different shades in this palette
we're gonna go into bangle and we're
gonna take that on the lower lash line
and this one we're kind of even though
this is a bit more detailed we're gonna
kind of smoke it out on the bottom lash
line and then we're gonna go into the
dark brown which is called chocolate and
then last we're gonna go into the black
this is blending out pretty nicely
I think this brush is fine it's not like
my favorite but I don't like hate it and
I'm kind of like blending this black
into the wing I feel like honestly the
black shadow has like made the eyeliner
almost like you can't see that I have
actual eyeliner on so I will have to get
back to you and let you know how it
looks with like other shadows and
whatnot oh my gosh I'm trying to get
this liquid lipstick off and it's like
impossible so that's gonna be on there
further okay
I'm gonna finish my eyes off-camera I'm
gonna put some mascara on I'm gonna add
some black liner as well as some white
liner and I will be back so we can
finish up the lips and I can show you
the final look using the box items so my
white liner just like fell on the floor
like whatever was left so we're just
gonna
on the waterline today can go all the
way smokey I feel like whenever I go all
the way black in my waterline my mom is
like were you crying like no it's just
what my eyes look like and that's why I
almost never put black in the waterline
but we went for it today let me know
what you guys think do you like the
white or do you like the black in the
waterline let's finish up this look
let's put on the lid this is that matte
gloss in sweetheart so I'm going to be
putting this on this is a very popular
color but I don't love this color
honestly on myself okay so that's the
best we can do for the lip it's drying
down now as it's drying it is kind of
sticky the DOE foot was pretty easy to
apply it it doesn't have a ton of
product on it so I was able to like
maneuver it pretty well I thought I feel
like the colors drying down a little bit
which is nice but it's not my favorite
color so I'm gonna zoom us out to show
you guys the final look and I'll give
you guys a few little final thoughts on
the box okay so this is the final look
zoomed out it's kind of dark and smoky
definitely I'm wearing makeup kind of
day overall I think this month's box is
really really nice I think you got a lot
of products for your money I especially
like this product in here this isn't
necessarily my particular favorite for
my skin but I do think it's nice it's
gonna be great for my kit and it's a
full-sized product that it saves me from
buying plus I think a lot of other
people would really enjoy trying that
when I look at the box as a whole the
liquid lipstick isn't my favorite but I
know a lot of people might enjoy this
the contour palette doesn't work for me
but I think it might work for other
people I don't think the quality's bad
it's just the colors on my skin might
not work and then when it comes to the
brushes I really like this brush but
instead of these brushes I wish we would
have gotten another makeup item I think
that would have been better but you know
I'm at least happy we got one really
nice brush even if the other ones aren't
like the best they're not bad but
they're just kind of basic and then I
think that this gel eyeliner is a really
really great one it's in the color black
so a lot of people will actually use it
it's not like royal blue or something
which would be fun but I feel like kind
of would cut down the practicality it's
in a really cool potted form I think
like presentation and practicality is
like a win on this one so this is like
the perfect product I feel like to get
in a box like this it also dries down
I don't think that it's gonna transfer
anything so I will obviously let you
guys know about this in the review video
to come but overall I think this is a
great box and I'm really happy with this
month so let me know what you guys think
of the products in the May box did you
guys like them did you not I know there
are different variations but if you got
anything similar to mine let me know
what you think and with this video I do
have my review up of the April box so I
will leave that link down below I upload
them on the same day but they are just
in different videos so if you want to
check out what I think about the
products that we got in April's box
after testing them for a month
definitely go check that video out and
other than that thank you guys so so
much for watching I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
