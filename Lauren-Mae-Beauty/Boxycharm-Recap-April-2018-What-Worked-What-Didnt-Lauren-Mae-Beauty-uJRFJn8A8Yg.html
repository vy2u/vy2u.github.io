Lauren thank you so much for watching
today is gonna be a boxycharm interview
this is for the month of April so I've
already done an unboxing and Tryon so I
will leave that video link down below so
I've been trying these items for the
past month and I'm gonna give you guys
some more in-depth reviews than
obviously a first impression let you
guys know what I think was it worth it
kind of just my thoughts after testing
them out for a lot longer so the month
of April's theme was eye candy and so
all of these were supposed to somehow
relate to that I'm not sure how much
that theme really played into this box
but you know I'm not really necessarily
super into the theme I get that you know
how many themes can you have and
obviously they're picking products that
they can get and put in the box anyway
that's not what this is about let's get
into the first item this is the product
that they didn't test out on camera cuz
they just didn't feel like putting it on
and if I had who the first impressions
would have been real because this
product smells disgusting okay this is
the vacuum cleaner pores no more pore
purifying mask from dr. Brandt this is a
very pricey item and this is the
full-size cuz it's boxycharm and they
send you full-size products this retails
for 47 dollars and when I tell you this
smells gross it smells like a mix of
sulfur and mint and like menthol it's
like so weird I hate it so much I've
used it three times every time I use it
I hate the smell I just I can't I don't
know if I can do it guys I really
honestly haven't seen any results when
it comes to this like actually cleaning
out my pores and getting rid of like
gunk in them so I'm gonna try to maybe
use this like three more times
consistently in one week span see if I
can see any difference and if not I'm
gonna pass it on this is a pretty small
size I feel like it's one ounce but you
do only have to use it in the areas that
are like problem areas for your pores so
you don't put this over your entire face
but honestly that smell it's almost too
much for me it honestly smells like my
skin is like dying on my face or
something and it's it's a it's an
intense situation I know that sulfur and
that's like sulfur II smell isn't a lot
of like kind of like acne products like
the Mario Badescu one kind of smells
like this when it dries and everything
but this is just so intense especially
because my largest pore issue area is my
nose so it smells pretty gross a couple
of you guys warned me in the comments
and yeah it's intense so if you're very
sensitive to smells you will hate this
hate hate hate hate hate it as it dries
though it does have kind of like this
cooling burning sensation so I feel like
maybe it's working but that also could
just be like the mint in it so I don't
know I don't know I haven't seen enough
good results that make me want to keep
using it despite the smell and I feel
like if the results were amazing I
honestly would be like this is great
even with the nasty smell but since I
just haven't seen any change it's like
is it worth it is it worth the little
part of me that dies every time I visit
next let's talk about the brushes I feel
like I'm kind of harsh on the brushes
I'll give it that I've gotten brushes in
every single one in my boxycharm so far
these are really expensive the set of
these brushes it says retails for 3850 a
lot of you guys were telling me in the
comments that you hadn't seen anyone get
these brushes and I think they're really
cute I wouldn't ever pay $40 I would say
that so far with everything that I've
tested these are definitely my favorite
brushes that I've got in the boxycharm
boxes so that's a plus I'm really happy
with these let's talk about the
eyeshadow palette I did a four looks one
palette on this so I will leave that
link down below I feel like a lot of my
looks turned out the same which I will
say I was using a lot of the same colors
like sea stars but I feel like when it
comes to this palette there's basically
two transition shades for my skin tone
in here one kind of mid-tone color and
then there are like three darker this
dark brown has like a shimmer in it
which isn't the my favorite but it still
works fine and then these two colors
there's like a purpley and like a red I
feel like they look kind of similar on
the eye this is gonna give you a very
like a berry toned look so keep that in
mind it's just definitely gonna be warm
and red berry there are a couple duo
crumbs in here which are really pretty I
did a look with the purple one in the
actual unboxing so again that'll be
linked I love the look I created with
this shade here and that cut crease
during the tutorial while I was doing it
I really didn't like it but every time I
look back at that footage I have a
couple of pictures I'll actually insert
some of my screenshots I just feel so
forgetting pretty I'm like man I should
do so
more intense makeup more often so I
really like that I haven't tried this
shape yet honestly it's one of the
duochrome so I need to try that the pink
is absolutely stunning I love the pink
so so much
I just kept wanting to use and every
time I open this palette I just feel
like it calls to me it's kind of that
pop in the middle of this palette but if
you were to take this pink away it's
pretty neutral and I enjoy the quality
of this I would not purchase this
palette and I wouldn't feel like I'd be
missing really anything in my collection
with what I already have but I do enjoy
having this palette and I will continue
using this either putting it in my kit
or keeping it for myself so it was a
nice thing to get into the box
I feel like it was good quality and the
color selection works well for me
something I wasn't the biggest fan of
this is the MAC lipstick and this is the
lip density lipstick in burnt violet
this is just so dark if I'm being honest
I haven't worn it since that video I
doubt I'll wear it until maybe fall time
maybe I'll wear it then but this just
isn't my type of lip color on the daily
on top of that the formula of this is
one of those like more creamy
moisturizing formulas which I like but
in a dark color like this it just makes
it kind of precarious you might like you
know your hair gets in it it's all over
your face before you know it it's like a
past your eyebrow you don't know how it
happened
these just tend to migrate so yeah I'm
not sure how much I'm gonna use this a
lot of you guys mentioned that you could
like blot this on and not do as
intensive a lip and that's definitely an
option but again I tend to just go for
more of like a lighter gloss on the
everyday so that's still not an everyday
thing for me I'm probably gonna add this
to my kit I don't necessarily think this
is a bad thing to have in the box
because everyone's skin tone is
different everyone's preferences are
different that's kind of the gamble you
take with a subscription box but for me
personally this one just didn't work out
and just you guys know that retails for
$21 and the colour-pop palette retails
for 16 the last item here is something
that I actually really like and it kind
of works the opposite of that MAC
lipstick this is something that a lot of
people got in the same color boxy time I
don't believe takes any type of
consideration of like what your hair
color is your eye color anything like
they just send you out products so it's
interesting to me that they even would
send out a brow product that isn't a
clear like gel or something because I
mean not everyone's going to be blonde
but this works for me and I really
really like it this is the brow gel the
instant light hair o3 tinted brow gel
with microfibers really love this a
habit of my brows today I've been using
it off and on this is pretty expensive I
believe it retails for $21 so I don't
think I'd pay the price but it's
definitely something that I enjoy and
get use out of from getting it through
the subscription I really like the color
in my brows I also love how small this
spoolie is I talk a lot about different
brow gels I feel like a lot of them I
really like but something I usually say
is like when you take it out like scrape
it off and start in the center but this
brush honestly just picks up so little
product which is so nice so you can
really have some control over how much
you're applying to the brows it almost
seems dried out which this sounds really
negative but it's not if you use these
types of products it's like there's this
sweet spot where you've used enough of
it where when you take out the spoolie
it has the perfect amount of product on
it instead of too much and you don't
have to worry about like looping it on I
feel like that's how this products been
since the beginning which is really
really nice so yeah this has worked
really well for me the color just
happened to work I feel really lucky and
I honestly really enjoy this it's again
it's not something I would purchase but
from the box it's something I really
really did enjoy so for me these three
items made the box worth it this is like
basically $40 $16 and another $21 so I
definitely got over my $22 worth for the
box these are things that are gonna last
me a super long time I mean the brow gel
has a 12-month lifespan on it it
probably would last that long if I use
it like every single day palettes gonna
last me forever and then the brushes I
could have for years to come so I think
that overall this was a great box
although I didn't like everything in the
box that's just again how subscription
boxes work there's this gamble which
kind of adds to the fun and excitement
the mystery of it all so as long as you
get some items that are gonna at least
recoup your money back and are things
that you're going to use in your
collection and actually enjoy I think
that they're worth it and I've been
really enjoying boxes in general I know
I have done quite a few unboxings I have
another one
coming up and then I have a couple that
I'm interested in so let me know if you
like the unboxings I know like I'm not
trying to like make my channel an
unboxing channel but yeah I just I've
been enjoying boxes kind of being the
one that can maybe show you some other
ones out there in case it's something
that you're interested in I definitely
don't think that every single box is for
everyone and that you should have like a
million subscriptions to them but I
think that subscription boxes are kind
of this fun thing especially if you can
find one that fits your budget and that
you feel like you're getting your value
from it's kind of fun so anyway that's
my review on the April boxycharm box
that I received
I'm gonna leave my may unboxing link
down below I uploaded it on the same day
so it's just on a separate video instead
of making one like massive video so if
you are interested to see what I got in
the mail box definitely go check that
out and other than that thank you guys
so so much for watching I hope you're
having an amazing day and I will see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
