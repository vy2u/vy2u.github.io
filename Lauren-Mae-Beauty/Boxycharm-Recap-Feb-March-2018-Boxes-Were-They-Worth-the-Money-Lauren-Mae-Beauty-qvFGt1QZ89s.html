to learn thank you so much for watching
today I want to recap with you some of
the past boxycharm boxes that have
gotten in the future I am going to be
uploading this on the same day I do my
unboxing it'll be like two videos in one
on that day that way you guys can get
the recap of the month before in its own
video and then the unboxing in its own
video it just didn't work out for this
one because let's get it back into town
getting into the swing of things but
just you guys know going in the future
that'll be kind of like all one video
just so I don't have too many boxycharm
videos because I know not everyone loves
the Bobbsey charm but a lot of you guys
really do so that's awesome too that all
being said I have two boxes worth of
recaps here for you so I've been trying
this stuff out and with this recap I
want to just tell you guys like if I
think it's worth it if I think it's a
good product will I be using it in my
collection with boxycharm items like I
think that the value a lot of the times
is for that surprise it's like this fun
thing so as long as you get like one
maybe two items that you get some use
out of I think it potentially could be
worth it obviously what people want out
of the box is different and what people
consider worth it can be different but
that's kind of where my parameters are
but anyway let's just get into the items
so this video isn't linked to long so I
saved the little cars I'm so organized
so the first one I ever got was called
galaxy glow this was for the February
2018 box so we're gonna go through I
also want to kind of talk about like if
it matched the theme because I think
that's kind of like a good point so the
first item on the list was the Naked
cosmetics holographic highlighter
palette or collection is what they say
this is what it looks like it has six
different shades in it and they're all
like a duochrome
highlighter situation in the unboxing
video I always try the things on and I
have used this it sends that video as
well I do really like this I think it's
nice I would never pay for this they
claim that this retails for $40 and
that's like way too expensive for how
cheap the packaging feels and honestly
the quality of the powders these are a
bit chunky but you can like blend them
out nicely they kind of have the
situation where if you really blend them
in enough you don't see them necessarily
straight on but then when you turn
that's when the flash happens and I
think that's something a bit unique like
not all highlighters do that usually
they're always flashing somewhere but
these ones are only
in like a certain light where they'll
show that duochrome and I think that's
kind of nice so this is something that I
will keep in my collection I did utilize
this in other ways than just on the face
I liked using these as Stoppers as inner
corner highlight so it's kind of like my
favorite way to use them honestly which
is you know for how big these pants are
and all that obviously not its intended
purpose but that's how I like to use it
and I have been enjoying this so I don't
think it's worth the $40 but I'm happy
to have it in the box I will continue to
use this and keep it this is a different
formula than the other like holographic
highlighting palette to have like the
kat von d palette like the moon child
palette from Anastasia this is
definitely a different formula I prefer
that formula but these are a bit of
different colors so there is a bit of a
difference there so overall I like this
I thought it went with the theme well
it's nice
definitely gel go pay $40 worth the next
item in here was the cover effects
shimmervale and this is in the shade
amethyst it's beautiful I really really
like this I had no problems with this is
one of my favorite items I've ever gone
in a boxycharm
not only because it's high-end and I
know it's really expensive and it's
actually a brand I know but because I
actually like this product this is a
product that I would be at least
interested in trying I probably would
have never pulled the trigger because
this retails for $28 and that's pretty
expensive when there are other like less
expensive options on the market now but
like that all being said I really do
like this I've worn this a couple
different times since that video and I
love the color this is a bit sheer so I
definitely suggest like either using a
base or just I don't know I like that
about it though I think you can
definitely still get an impactful
beautiful look with this on the lid
you're just not gonna get crazy opacity
it's not gonna look like you put a loose
glitter on your lids if that makes sense
it has just more of a subtlety than that
and I like that about it I didn't find
that this gave me like crazy fallout I
feel like with every single liquid
eyeshadow that I've ever used it has
like that sparkling glitter to it it's
gonna have a little bit of followed by
the end of the day like even the Stila
wands like everything I've ever tried
has a little bit so this was nothing
that like causes me concerned or makes
me like hate my makeup or makes me not
want to wear it so yeah I enjoy this do
I think you should buy it wait I don't
know I don't even know if I would
purchase another one but I definitely
highly enjoyed this one and this
definitely made the box worth it and I
think it goes with the galaxy colloseum
really well next let's talk about the
vintage cosmetics eyeliner this is just
a black eyeliner in jet black this isn't
the best quality eyeliner I've ever used
when you just watch this it's not like
one of those ones it just glides and
you're like you melt a little bit
because it's melting on your hand and
you're just like crying tears of joy
definitely not the consistency of the
sack liner as you can tell I've used a
lot of this though I've used it a lot in
different tutorials get ready with me
like just a ton if you've been watching
a lot of my videos you've probably seen
this quite a few times I don't know what
it is I like this does it stay in place
no it doesn't even really set so it does
get a little bit of transfer I get a
little bit of that like collection of
gunk I guess on the outer corner in the
inner corner if I'm not like paying
attention throughout the day but I don't
know I don't I guess I don't really have
like a ton of black eyeliners and I like
the consistency of this the fact that it
isn't super gliding I just I kind of
like that about it but it still has I
mean I'm not like tugging at my eye it
still has a nice Glide it's just not
like that really glide a formula you
know what I'm talking about
so overall I've been enjoying it I would
never pay the money for it I don't think
this is the best eyeliner ever yeah it
does smudge it doesn't stay in place all
day it's not like the black is black but
for whatever reason I've been reaching
for it and using it the most out of
everything I think I've gotten from my
boxy terms so whether that's just it was
filling a hole in my collection that I
didn't know I really had or what and I
don't know if it's it's not necessarily
because of this product it's just like
I've kind of think about any black
eyeliner I would have got in the box
would have served this purpose but I
have been enjoying it so it's it's given
me a lot of value this does not
necessarily go with galaxy glow but it's
a staple product and that retails for
$21 and no I would never pay that and
the last two items in the galaxy glow
box
yeah these are fails for me the first
one here is from pure and this is the
EXFO lips it's an exfoliating lip like
thing I do not like this I don't like
the texture on my lips I don't like the
consistency I just I don't like it I
know a lot of you guys were saying you
really enjoy it and I think that's great
there's just something weird about it to
me and I'm a texture person so I think
that's part of what's freaking me out
about this but I just do not enjoy it I
will be passing this on to my mom
most likely hey yeah I did not enjoy it
I just I wish there were more gritty
particles per moisturizing matrix it
just it doesn't work for me
it has like this sweet scent but the
bomb itself in there just it feels
greasy and gross like as immediately as
they put on my lips I don't like the
feeling it just kind of like skeeves me
out and I've found with some lip balms
that are like too thin like the Moroccan
oil one I had to return that cuz it just
I didn't like the feeling on my lips
like I knew as soon as I put it on I was
like no oh yeah sometimes I just get
weirded out and this is one of those
products don't enjoy it it's 17 dollars
retail which i think is a lot of money
for this product I wouldn't pay it
didn't like it but for the other
products I still think the box is worth
it and that didn't really go with the
theme either you know they could have
done like a glittery lip gloss or
something that would have gone better
but whatever and last for the books we
have some brushes these are from crown
and these retail for $29.99 for this
trio oh I just don't like this these are
soft I don't think that whoa lots of
powder on that one I don't think that
$30 is like a good price for these these
feel cheap I don't like how the ferrule
and I just don't like them I don't like
them I don't reach for them I thought
that this shape looked a little
promising at first but it just is a
little more dense than I like this brush
is one I really love with that tapered
you know feel to it
this is from Coastal Scents it's like in
a kit and I love it I've been using it
ever since I got it it's like the only
bronzer brush I use and I love it so
much and I was hoping that this would be
a similar thing but it's just not so I'm
gonna wash these and pass them on the
eye brush is probably the thing that I
get the most use out of but I have like
10 million brushes like this so I don't
need it so I'm gonna pass these on as
well overall for the galaxy glow box
I think it was worth it because I did
like three out of the five items so
overall it was decent obviously it would
be amazing for me to love all of the
items but I think again for the twenty
two dollar price tag getting a $28
liquid eyeshadow already pays for the
box itself so I do think it's still
worth it next let's talk about vacation
I feel like this went in line with that
whole boxycharm trip that they took I
know Rob Beauty Christie went
super happy for her so anyway this was
an exciting bucks because it came with a
pallet I was so pumped from pallet I'd
only had the one other box before so I
was trying not to get sneak peeks but
like I couldn't help it come on
so the boxy charm and pure pallet so
exciting
you see sneak previews of this and
you're like whoa so pretty man has a
blue has a pink we got some peaches but
we have some neutrals like I was down
for this palette color story wise now if
you watched my four looks one palette
with this you will know that I do not
like this palette I tried guys I tried
so many looks I've done at least five
different looks I've used every single
shadow in this palette and I just don't
like it
I think the shade nakey which on their
own website they call naked on the
swatch picture even though it's Nikki in
the palette anyway just just a little
shade there sorry but anyway that's like
the only shadow I really like I mean the
cream ones kind of nice too but honestly
I just feel like the texture of these
shadows is off they don't have a
metallic sheen to them like they should
they're just freaking weird
this blue you think is gonna be so great
you even swatch it and you're like oh
yeah pigment baby but it has these like
flakies in it
that suck and so then it turns into a
basically like a matte shadow I just I
really dislike this I really really did
so hopefully if you have the boxycharm
you like it that would be awesome
obviously that's the goal but for me
horrible horrible horrible horrible and
this retails for $36 like seriously no
colour-pop has such better eyeshadows
for I mean literally less than half the
price of that so I was disappointed I
was so disappointed with that I do think
that one with the theme know that's the
pasta moving on to the next item on the
sheet here this is the bella pierre
volumizing mascara now you could either
get this one or a butter LONDON one and
i really wish i got the butter LONDON
one because that one seems like
something that a lot of people actually
enjoyed this one is sex I've used it
look at that what what's going on here
what's going on it's just basic this is
such a basic mascara
it smells basic just everything about it
it feels
cheap it doesn't do anything for your
lashes I've used this maybe only twice
and then after that I was like f that
like I'm done using it I'm not you know
I know I don't like this thing this
retails for $20 definitely not with $20
alone just like I just don't like this I
don't like it at all
I wish I did it's a alright this box is
not doing well also vacation that
doesn't really go with it I wish it was
like a waterproof mascara that would
make sense with like a vacation right I
think that would have been a good choice
but I didn't curate the box I didn't
curate the box okay next let's talk
about the South main three I gel packs
now I use these in the video but I only
kept them on like 10 ish minutes and
then a lot of people in the comments
were saying like you're supposed to use
them every single day and I didn't I
didn't use these like that day and then
the next day I've only used two of them
I have one left still this is my idea of
patches I don't notice anything that's
going to be like super long term
honestly to me these are more of like a
topical thing to help deep Huff to make
you feel nice yeah get rid of any
puffiness tiredness just kind of refresh
you and revive you so you just look
better than maybe you would have if you
hadn't use them these take forever these
are a 30-minute eye patch or eye mask
and they're a thicker pink gel overall I
do like these I think these are a really
reasonable price as well they retail for
ten dollars for three of them which i
think is great so it'd be nice little
gift a little stocking stuffer I don't
know whatever I think these are nice you
can't get them everywhere like if they
were readily accessible I could see
myself purchasing them again but since
they're not I probably wouldn't ever
like go out of my way to go to the
website something I really liked about
these though is that they stayed in
place on my eyes for the 30 minutes I
wasn't like up around doing stuff but I
was just like on my phone whatever but
they also stayed cool the whole time
which was very intense so if you are
sensitive maybe you won't want to keep
them on but like I literally felt the
cooling effects of these masks on my the
entire 30 minutes whereas with my number
7
you know after they're on for a little
bit they just are kind of there I don't
feel this cooling effect and these like
stayed cooling the entire time so that's
just something I've noticed different
that I don't know if it's the thickness
of these because these are thicker than
a lot of the other ones I've used but
overall I did enjoy them I didn't notice
any like
darkness or anything like that my eyes
felt super refreshed after I used it for
the 30 minutes though like I definitely
did feel like there was less puffiness
so yeah I think these are nice I did
enjoy them for how I use and expect the
results for those products we have two
more products to talk about next I have
the pretty vulgar blush and this is in
the shade prim vixen I got the super hot
pink which I was kind of excited for if
you guys saw that video if you haven't
I'll leave the two unboxings down below
but I did a more avant-garde look where
I put the pink into like my sides of my
face and stuff so I really enjoyed that
look I have used it since and you can
use this in a very like subtle way as
much as this is pigmented it blends out
very nicely and it looks really great
someone pointed out in that video and I
think it's a good point to make that you
know for me this isn't something I want
to wear on the everyday but you know not
everyone is my skin tone so for me this
is a really crazy blush but for someone
else of a darker skin tone this might be
like that perfect pop of like some color
but it's obviously not going to be as
intense as it is on my fair skin so I
think it is nice that they have you know
options that are gonna work for multiple
skin tones so that is a positive overall
it's something I will keep in my
collection this retails for $26 so it's
very expensive I wouldn't have paid for
this myself but pretty vulgar is a brand
that I've been you know I've been
curious about their packaging is really
pretty so to me regardless of the color
I thought this was something I was
excited to get in the box because it was
something I was already you know kind of
thinking about I already had my eye on
before getting it in the subscription so
that was a win for me I will say though
I do tend to use that more on my eyes or
it's just more of an inspiring blush to
me so I never really do like everyday
looks with that blush instead I just I
always go crazy
me and Sam went out to dinner the other
night and I put a little bit of the pink
on my nose like I don't know yeah so
that's what it inspires me to do though
are more like fun bright different looks
with it and I do like that so I will
keep that in my collection at least for
now and then last year we have a brush
set from the vintage cosmetics company
so there are three different brushes
here different shapes and whatnot it's
supposed to be a set that you can like
you know step one step two step three
I wish there was a blending brush in
here but you know I can't really choose
it though this retails for I'm not
really sure I think this is like a
British company so it says on here that
it retails for oh yeah it's because of
the exchange rate okay it says it
retails for 2315 at least at the time of
this box with the exchange rate and
everything I feel like that's really
expensive this is a brand I've seen that
like Ross and TJ Maxx so I know that
that's not really what people are
necessarily paying for this product as
you see we have the classic this one in
the middle that is the classic brush you
get in this subscription box I guess as
you can see it's very similar to the one
in the last box from crown overall with
these brushes I don't think they're bad
I don't think they're great I don't
think the cuts are that amazing like
they're kind of wonky they're soft but
not like amazingly soft like they're
whatever these are things that I will
probably keep in my collection at least
for now but I would have never purchased
these I definitely don't think they're
worth the price they don't necessarily
go with the theme they're just brushes
like a brush can go with anything I
guess those are just kind of like a mint
item I feel like the vacation one was
something that I was super excited for I
thought was gonna be an amazing value
but since I ended up not liking that
palette it wasn't the best value for me
personally the only things I liked were
the blush and the eye gels so I mean
that still right there is a $36 value if
I were to go buy those but I wouldn't
have so I wish there was one other item
that I really liked out of here but
there really wasn't all right guys so
those are my boxycharm recaps I hope you
enjoyed the video if you got these boxes
let me know what you thought down below
something that's really interesting
about boxycharm is the fact that you
don't get the same items as someone else
necessarily who gets the Box it's not
like a set amount of items so you know
just getting a slight change in color
can totally change the value of the box
for yourself personally as we can see
with the last unboxing I did which was
April's box I got that matte lipstick
super dark and I wish I had gotten a
lighter one at work maybe even just
something else like but you know it's
still Mac which is exciting but the
color of it is what really made it a
damper for me anyway that's everything
guys thank you so so much for watching
and
I will hit you up with one of these
videos though on my next and boxing I
mean who doesn't love to videos in one
day right thanks guys I'll talk to you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
