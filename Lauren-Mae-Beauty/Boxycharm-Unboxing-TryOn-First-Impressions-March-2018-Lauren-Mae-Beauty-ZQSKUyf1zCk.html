channel it's Lauren that was a different
intro for me but I think we're gonna
stick with it today I'm super excited
because I'm gonna be bringing you my new
boxycharm box I know I just did one of
these videos but it's because I got
February's box
SuperDuper late so this is a March 2018
s box I'm sure you guys have seen some
of the unboxings already because I
already have I could not resist I'm
still super excited about getting a
monthly subscription box so I just can't
I can't resist I want to see what's in
the box so I think I know a few of the
items that are gonna be in here but I
have not opened it yet the seal is still
closed so let's open this up I'm gonna
show you guys what I got I do pay for
about to try myself it is $21.99 a month
and you get fortified full-size products
the box always values over $100 which is
awesome and yeah let's just get into it
I'm bare face because we will be doing a
Tryon and the last thing that I want to
mention before I get into the box is
that I do want to do a boxycharm like in
review video but since I only had the
products from my last boss u-turn for
like a couple of weeks not even two
weeks I don't think I don't want to be
able to give you guys better reviews
like I want to be able to wash the
brushes I want to use things more than
like one or two times so I will be
reviewing this box and February's box
next time I do my unboxing there'll be
separate videos but they'll be uploaded
at the same time so you can have that
information at the same time anything
that's all I wanted to say so let's just
get into it
okay so this is vacation and I already
knew some of the stuff that was going to
be in here because Rob Beauty Christy
she went on that vacation so happy for
her and so I knew pure stuff was gonna
be in here I saw that palette and loaded
so I'm not really gonna check this out
and I'm just gonna read you off prices
from it the first product right on top
is a blush from pretty vulgar I'm super
excited because this is a brand that
I've always been attracted to from
Sephora because it's in such beautiful
packaging but I had never tried before
so this is the make them blush blush in
prim vixen off the bat I will say the
packaging is pretty but very lightweight
I thought it'd weigh a little bit more
since I know this is a pricy product but
this is a hot hot pink I am excited for
this I know this is not a blush that
everyone's gonna like oh it's so silky
but you guys know me I love pink so I
can see myself using this
my eyes as well and I think for the look
I'm gonna do today I'm not gonna lie
like first thing everyone's thinking
like Oh what would I do with all those
products so I kind of have an idea of
what I'm gonna do we'll see you know
what's actually a box everything but
let's see this blush retails for $26
whoa that's a lot of money I would not
pay that much for this blush but I'm
excited to try it out next on top here
these are the three ijx from South Maine
so that's kind of a cool one I love this
type of stuff for my kit for other
people oh when they come individually
wrapped like that how nice I love using
these on people like if they've had like
a rough night or whatever they're a
little bit puffy in my kit they're
really great for that and then also like
for me in the same way so I think these
are really useful and they're fun I feel
like these can get a little bit pricey
so it's nice to get three of them
instead of just like a one pack and the
retail value of these is $10 which i
think is a really good price for three
of them I think if you just want to like
have them for like emergency situations
or when you really want to pamper
yourself you can keep a couple on hand
but you're not gonna be like spending
$30 like a lot of other ones next I
think this is a mascara yeah from
bellapierre this is the volumizing
mascara retails for $20 and I'm gonna
open it up because I am going to be
using it today to show you guys umm so
let's see packaging is pretty basic and
the wand is also pretty basic I'm a
little scared we'll try this out I will
say though with mascaras I'm not sold
and then I have to use it for like two
weeks and then I'm like okay I figured
out how to work with it so whether my
first impressions are good or bad I
think the real test for me with mascaras
is like using them consistently for a
while to really understand how to make
them best work for my lashes so Lizzie I
don't know next in the box before our
last item or just the boots exciting
this is from the vintage cosmetics it's
a little brush set this retails for
23:15 I don't think that's true I know I
see this brand a lot I like Ross and
like Marshalls and TJ Maxx and stuff I
actually have some like Clippers like
toenail clippers and stuff from them and
I feel like you could always get this on
sale like never at the retail price so I
feel like that's a little misleading
that's something I realized what this
box is like they
obviously put the highest price that
anyone would ever possibly pay but not
necessarily the actual price people
mostly go to kind of up the value but I
don't care as long as the products are
good so it comes with three different
brushes this is like a angled eyeshadow
brush these are really hard to get out I
thought they'd just like slide out but
now this one is similar to the brush we
got last time like a classic just like
fluffy shader and we have a smaller
fluffy shader off the bat first
impressions I want to say that I like
getting the brushes I think they're a
really awesome value in a subscription
box because it's something that's a non
consumable like you can use this for a
long time they're not gonna go bad and
all of that but I will say it's like I
want brushes that are great cuts
actually popular cuts like fluffy
blending brushes I feel like are what a
lot of us use and I've yet to get
something like that like these are all
just like standard basic brushes that I
feel like you have to try to figure out
how to use or maybe you use before you
had the right brushes type of thing I
just feel like I have all of these so
it's just kind of clutter in a way but
anyway I mean they seem really soft they
seem nice it's just when I look at my
own collection and how these will fit in
same with the brushes last time it's
kind of like I don't know from that note
let's get into the awesome thing this is
a palette and this is the pure and
boxycharm palette and I love our shadows
you guys know that let's pray that none
of these are broken
let's pray I can open it I was so
excited when I saw this it's like a
pretty neutral and I know it has that
pop of blue can we open it okay oh my
gosh I has a sticker on both sides I
just hope these are pigmented and
beautiful and not broken
no brokens yeah I don't I haven't seen
anyone haven't broken one but I just was
scared so this is the palette SuperDuper
fun I love this I'm super excited to try
it it's not something that I would ever
purchase but in the box I'm excited to
get it type of thing you know what I
mean so it has some really nice like
peachy shades and then I love the pinks
and the blues I think this color looks
beautiful so I know that this box isn't
free I obviously pay $22 to get it but
this feels like a fun free palette you
know so
I am excited to try that out and make
some cool looks with it and today
hopefully we'll do something but I'm
sorry if you can hear all the creaking
upstairs I'm gonna swatch a few of these
this one's kind of disappointing on
swatch oh the blue is pretty nice though
just some first impression swatches I
feel like this magenta this is a matte I
really had to like grind my finger in so
yeah I think it still has a lot of good
potential I am super excited I think
this will kind of like be something fun
for everyone where if you only like
neutrals you definitely have neutrals in
there but if you like color you have
some options so that was my box I'm
going to get into the trying portion of
this now so I'm gonna start off with the
i jealous because I can't put these on
with makeup on it says instruction wise
to thoroughly cleanse the eye area apply
this product under the eye leave on for
30 minutes oh wow so this is what they
look like I just built oh the juice on
me again gosh dang it okay so these are
very messy I'm just gonna take this out
very slimy this is not as easy like that
I don't know if I'm gonna have these on
for 30 minutes my goodness oh they
already feels so good I feel like these
are something that they just okay I look
crazy is this the way you do it I saw
someone put them on the other way where
do they put this skinny part like you
did this skinny part here I'm gonna try
that is that how you do it or do you put
the fat part let me know what you guys
do because it like I was like oh my gosh
I never even thought about doing it a
different way
I just think 30 minutes is kind of a
long time right I'm gonna try to leave
these on as long as possible I look like
I have like really red swollen eyes
right now but they seem to be sticking
on pretty well feeling really nice and
cool they're kind of just like classic
ones I just the serum and they're kind
of got all over everything and I also
feel like the serum really wasn't on the
pad very much it's just like a gel like
there's nothing on here it's just all
this liquid in this container well there
isn't much to say about these so I will
be back after about 30 minutes I'll let
you guys know how long I have them on
and then
and we'll move on to the rest of the
makeup alright what's up guys it's been
like 10 minutes and I'm done like I
don't know let me know if you guys like
if it's a 30 minutes would you do it
because I've used the patch ology ones
and they're like a 5 minute thing and
like that's what I'm talking about
I just I'm thinking about like
realistically like if I was getting
ready there's no way I'd have 30 min
like unless I'm going to like the
freaking Oscars I'm not like spending 30
minutes on these things but I still
think you'll get your money's worth out
of it like I still feel like it was
really cooling and it felt really nice
for the 10 minutes I did have it on I
just there's just no way personally I
would do it the thing that I liked about
these is that they didn't slide down at
all I wasn't like moving around I guess
but still that was nice they're very
thick and they feel like qualities some
of them are really really thin like even
the Pathology ones are a bit thinner
than this so yeah I liked him I liked
that they were pink
they also smelled like roses so that was
kind of nice and more than anything I
feel like these definitely just like
deep puffed and like made that under I
feel really nice and cool which is great
so I feel refreshed I'm gonna go do my
base makeup and get ready so we can try
on the rest of these products and I'll
be right back alright hi guys I'm back
don't mind my chapped lips they are so
chapped right now I was on the beach I
did a shoot for a music video on the
beach this weekend and I was too
dehydrated and I think the wind and the
Sun got me got me good I have my base on
I'm going to start off with the blush
today I'm oh maybe I shouldn't actually
let's start off with the eyeshadows two
eyeshadows umm I am excited to try this
out so first off I am going to go in and
just set my lid I already have primer
down and everything but I want to have
this cream matte all over the lid I'm
gonna be doing something a little bit
more I guess avant-garde I I was
thinking about how I'm gonna incorporate
the blue and then this also hot pink
blush like that's the hard part I feel
like those are such like rich colors
both of them and then trying to find a
way to put them together so far the
shades really pigmented and creamy
there's a little bit of kick up
pan and I personally don't mind that I
just like to tell you guys so yeah I
like the way that went on I probably
should have used one of the new brushes
for that step but I didn't so next I'm
going to go in with a blending brush and
the next shade over with a peach shade
this one here it's called nakey and I
believe it's it's like a matte it's kind
of like I said and I'm gonna be putting
that into the crease if you guys have
seen any of my more recent tutorials or
videos you guys have probably seen quite
a few peaches I feel like going on
somewhere whether it's a blush or
eyeshadow or a lip I just have been
enjoying the peach it looks so pretty
let me know if you guys want to see a
four looks one palette with this palette
since if you guys get the palette it
would be fun since you guys have it I
have it and we could you know have some
fun looks using this palette only so if
you want that let me know in the
comments next I'm going to deepen it up
with this shade here and I'm gonna be
using one of the what is my problem
today I'm having I'm having some issues
alright I'm gonna take the angled fluffy
brush and I'm just gonna be placing the
next shade over in the outer portion of
my eye I really hope I'm in focus guys
I'm sorry I try my best but I have
manual focus and so it can be difficult
when I'm alone trying to figure it out
okay so that's deepening it up a little
bit but honestly not that much so I wish
there was maybe a little bit more of a
difference in color for those two also
don't mind this like pimple I have on my
eye
what the Freak who gets that so
irritating I know it's because I plucked
my eyebrows I know it and that's why you
never pluck your eyebrows and that's why
you always leave a note I'm now gonna go
into the pink shade here I'm going to be
using another one of the brushes this is
just the fluffy shader brush we're going
into BFF sorry I'm not telling your
names so pretty this is going to be
sticking to the outer portion of the eye
this shade I don't know
I just want there to be a little bit
more payoff it's pretty I love Pink's
you guys know that and yes we will be
using the blue today I got you the shade
is blending really nice I like the way
that these are all looking together and
for the lid I'm just going in with my
finger and the shade charmer you like
that I'm just gonna be putting that on
my lid with my finger I feel like it
looked so pretty my finger and it's not
quite translating so I'm gonna go in
with the wet brush I don't actually have
a wet brush out here I do not have
anything too wet that right now so maybe
we'll just move on to the next step all
right taking the last brush that we got
this one is a little bit short
like smudger brush we're gonna take the
shade m.i.a and that's the blue and
we're gonna be running that on the lower
lash line I mean it's not that creative
of placement but I'm trying to
incorporate that blush and that was
really the hard thing so we're just
gonna smudge this underneath the eye I
really like the pigmentation of this I
will say though I'm nervous it's going
to stain and this has like a lot of blue
shimmer like glitter shimmer in it and I
wish it didn't I do like the way this
brush is applying it though this is
probably my favorite brush out of all of
them I like that it's small and detailed
and dense I think it does its job really
well I'm gonna try to punch up some of
that pink that we use the magenta in the
outer corner okay for now I'm gonna stop
on the eyes and we're gonna move on to
the blush I already have bronzer and
everything on still for the blush I was
thinking about kind of like doing some
is it called draping so since this is
such a bright pink I'm gonna put it more
on the cheekbones I should have just
gone like full-on Marie Antoinette or
something weird is gonna be putting it
in like a c-shape around the eye and
then I think I'm gonna try to
incorporate this blush like into the eye
shadow look a little bit too and bring
it down
I don't know this isn't going how I
wanted it to I'm not
gonna lie to you but that's okay I just
wanted to look like it's kind of like
coming out of the eye I will say I think
this is a pretty nice blush I kind of
expected it to be a little bit more
pigmented um so that's kind of nice if
you want a subtle look but yeah I'm just
building it up so it looks like it's
kind of like coming out of the eye and
then fading into up here and down here
and I'm gonna make sure I really work it
into the hairline so we don't have like
a stark line it's drawing on me a little
bit now that I've kind of like blended
it out and I don't have like a ring of
nothing here so that's good I am going
to go in back into the palate and that
pink shade just so I can kind of blend
the two Pink's together I'm just kind of
blending this out into the blush I'm
also gonna punch in this peach the first
peach we use in this front portion of
the brow not like into the brow just in
that like crease area right below it I'm
gonna go get a setting spray and also a
glitter glue so we can really punch in
that shadow on the lid and I'll be right
back I hope I'm better in focus now but
this got Cirque du Soleil really fast I
kind of like it though I thought I did
it at first but I think I've changed my
mind and I do like it
alright so I'm gonna be spraying a brush
this is not like the ideal brush but I
need to clean my brushes so I'm gonna be
taking this and dipping it into the
charmer shade hopefully we can get
something that pops a little bit more
than what we had going on I thought that
it would go on really nicely with the
finger but it didn't and now all that's
still what I'm going in with my finger
there we go
there's some more pigment I definitely
have some like sparkle fallout from that
shadow but it's pretty good what's going
with highlighter i'm using my dior one
this is in 0-2 i'm gonna be putting this
on top of where we put all that blush i
think it's gonna give a nice like sheen
i'm also gonna put it on the normal
places you would highlight and then i'm
also gonna take this highlighter on my
inner corner I feel like the charmer
shade is kind of like the lightest
shimmer shade in there and so that's not
gonna work for me on an inner corner
because it barely worked on the lid I'm
gonna go off camera and I'm going to put
on some liners I'm using the black
vintage one on my tight line and I'm
using this white one on my lower lash
line I decided I want to punch up the
blue just a little bit so I'm gonna go
back in let's do some mascara this is
that bellapierre one I'm nervous I hope
this is good so far I don't know man all
right I touched it to that eyeball I
also touched it all on my inner corner
so this is it with one coat it's not
that great it's not like horrible I'd
rather have more natural looking lashes
then have them clump together so I like
that this isn't clumping but I don't
like that it's not like giving any
definition to the longer parts of my
lashes it's just kind of giving me a
nice piece of lashes if that makes sense
so that's kind of like two coats I'm
gonna have to get back to you on this
just because again I know how I am with
mascaras and I don't think it's fair to
say yes or no because there's been
things that I loved and then hated and
then hated and loved so I'm gonna try to
get off some of those corner here yeah
there's a lot of sparkle all over my
face right now so as you guys can
probably tell my lips are disgusting
they're super chapped it's crazy so for
today I don't want to really do anything
that's going to hurt them anymore so I'm
just going to be putting on some lip
gloss I think I'm gonna go with a Fenty
Beauty one yeah I think that's nice it
almost adds a peach alright so that is
the look so far and I'm gonna zoom out
and give you guys a review on all the
stuff it's like a boxing thing I don't
know all right guys so we're zoomed out
this is the final look I'm really happy
with it I was a little bit scared of the
blush effort so I'm not gonna lie when I
started doing the whole draping but I
think it looks really pretty it's
definitely a bit out there a little bit
avant-garde I know a lot of people
wouldn't do this but I think it's really
pretty and I'm still gonna film my next
video like this
you know let's do a little recap of the
items and what I think about them now
that I've tried them and then we can
wrap this video up I feel like it's
gonna be a long one so I'm sorry
overall I don't think there's anything
in this box that I would probably pay
for except for these I do think these
are nice I think they're great price
these are the under-eye gels you get
three of them for again ten dollars I
think that's a good price I would
suggest these for someone who's looking
for a cheap alternative to trying these
and I thought they were good quality for
the price so I did like these I just
would have wear them for 30 minutes so
this is probably one of my favorite
items in the sense of like use and
practicality and price and hitting all
the check marks for me so I do really
like these blush I do like the blush I
think it's really pretty I think it
blended out really nice I think
something that I don't like about it is
that the packaging is a little bit light
for it being so expensive so there's no
way I would pay $26 for this blush I
also think that it's a very classic
subscription box move where they give
you a really bright color something
that's not as wearable in the box
and I wish they would have given out a
nude or something like that because
those are the colors that people mostly
wear I like wearing a bunch of colors
but I think that that kind of brings
down the value of it because it's such a
bright pink and there's positives to the
fact that you might not have a color
like this but there's also probably a
reason you don't have a color like this
in your collection so I wish that it was
just maybe a bit more wearable of a
color for the value of the box but it is
a nice quality blush
I just wouldn't pay for it mascara I
will let you guys know more first
impressions though it's not that great
it's not like horrible but it's on the
best brushes I kind of feel the same way
about the brushes I think that the price
isn't correct like you could probably
get this set for like ten dollars or so
at one of those stores I mentioned Ross
t.j.maxx or something like that quality
wise these are really soft they blended
fine on the eyes I just don't love the
shapes I do like the one I use for the
blue under the eyes the best and can see
myself using that a lot more and I mean
it's not like I won't use these I will
use them I just you know it'll be like
after all my other brushes are dirty or
something it's just not I don't see
these becoming like Holy Grail or
anything and last I didn't even tell you
how much it's retails for this is $36 if
you were to just buy this so you might
as well get the box because it's cheaper
so obviously you guys saw me create this
I look and I like the color combination
of these shades I will say I'm a little
bit disappointed I thought that these
two shades worked really nicely and
enjoyed those this I feel like these are
all just very similar like maybe pick
this and this and then do something
darker or deeper they do have different
finishes but I just find that you know
they they could have just had more depth
in those colors I think and it would
have been better the blue went on really
pigmented I am scared it's gonna sting
but I will let you guys know in my
review video later on I was disappointed
with this purple that's what I have on
the outer corner and I felt like I
really did try to build it up let me
make sure my eyes are even I feel like
the other side's a little darker um I
just don't think that this built up as
nicely as it should've for how dark it
looks in the panic I just wish it was
more pigmented this black has like a ton
of sparkle in it you can see it there I
wish it didn't and then even the blue
has like really chunky like flaky
glitter in it and I wish it was just
like a shimmer super pigmented though I
mean it looks great under the eye just a
few problems also this one on the lid it
didn't like it looks so pretty on my
finger I just don't feel like it really
translated onto the lid well so that's
kind of disappointing I still think it's
nice for getting it in the box but again
I would not pay for it and I think
that's kind of the theme for this one I
would not pay for any of this stuff
separately after using it it's it's not
that great but I do think the value of
the 22 dollars to try it all out was
still good I'm excited to see what's in
next month for me this is like a fun
grab bag of makeup to try out and
hopefully I can find some really cool
things from it but this month honestly
I'm not like disappointed but it's not
as great as I thought it was gonna be
with that palette in it I do like the
look that I was forced to create with
all of these more colorful colors but uh
yeah that's it I think that's everything
I will get back to you guys again in the
review and with next month's video but
let me know what you thought of this
month's box did you like it did you not
