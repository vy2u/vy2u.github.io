is going to be my bronzer collection if
you haven't seen the other collection
videos that I've done this year I will
leave a link down below but I am doing
this because I am a part of the project
paint community which is a community
that is just focused on getting use out
of the makeup we actually have and
trying to just control spending not just
buying every product ever out there so
as much as this is to show you guys what
I have because we all love collection
videos it's also a way for me to really
explore my collection and kind of reshot
my stash and get excited about the
products that I already own and love and
have invested in so let's just get into
my bronzers I hope you guys enjoy the
video I have quite a few bronzers but
also I feel like I could have more I'm
honestly working on quite a few right
now so I know by the end of the year
I'll have a couple out so the first one
I'm going to show you is my Smashbox
contour trio and I've already used up
the highlight and I'm working on the
bronzer and the contour so yeah I feel
really good about these I love this
contour palette I think it's amazing if
you're looking for something that's like
a one and done type of thing I think
this is great I think it's good for the
money it blends out really nice and I
feel like the tones are really nice
really really great I definitely suggest
it I don't feel like it gets talked
about enough this is a product I'm
actually wearing today this is from
orlon and this is a bronzed compact it's
absolutely massive and it is quite warm
which if you're using this as a bronzer
isn't necessarily a bad thing it's just
about how you apply it and how heavy you
apply it where you apply it obviously
you're not gonna contour what's
something like this I've been playing
with it lately I got this for I got this
from my friend you've got it for free as
part of like gratis from a show she
worked I'm working on seeing how I like
this product since I hadn't used it
before just to see if I want to keep it
in my collection so far it's nothing
like you have to have but I do have it
in my collection that one is probably
pretty expensive because orlon is pretty
expensive it's mostly like a skincare
brand why not do another expensive one
this is as you wash a high bronzer and
this is in too this is part of like a
limited edition thing a couple years ago
the pattern on it is what like sold me
immediately but as you can tell
I have used it because the pop pattern
is gone this has a slight sheen to it
but nothing glittery which I really
actually enjoy I think it brings a nice
luminosity to the skin again I know a
lot of people use bronzers as contours
but a bronzer is something different so
it can be warm and it can have shimmer
um you know you're using it to warm up
your face give it some definition and
give it some life after using powders
and you know foundation so really really
beautiful I really like this one this
one is one from Sephora this is also
limited edition and this is the SOL Del
Rio matte bronzer this was on a project
pan a while ago as you can tell this
one's a lot cooler you can use this as a
bronzer or a contour I really enjoy this
product I wish it wasn't limited edition
it has since I hit pan on it because it
has ridges in it started to crack so
it's definitely not one I can really
bring with me anymore I should probably
just kind of finish it up not that it'll
take no time at all it took a while but
I probably should finish it up just so
it doesn't crack unexpectedly and almost
become like unusable I could repress it
but I really really enjoy this one if
you bought this when kathleenlights was
like raving about it you know how much
you love this and how awesome it is this
is a bronzer from laura geller
and this one is crazy glowy this one is
the all-over face and body glow in
Tahitian glow as much as I don't use
this I can't get rid of it it's almost a
highlight it could be a highlight on
darker skin tones it just is so
beautiful there's something about it
that I just can't part with so I've kept
this one I'm gonna try to use it this
summer and see if there's a way that I
can make it work I really love laura
geller products and I feel like besides
the honey like highlighter or whatever I
feel like she doesn't that brand just
doesn't get talked about and I wish it
did I feel like they have really awesome
products and I know everyone has this
like issue with baked products even I
have kind of like a like oh they're
baked products but hers are really nice
this is a classic this is the NYC smooth
skin bronzer and sunny I've gone through
one of these and this is like my second
one
haven't used this in a long time and I
honestly think I'm gonna declutter it
soon because when I went to swatch it it
just it has so much hardpan and I
haven't used it in such a long time and
I don't know I just I don't know why it
has so much hard pan when I'm not even
using it so I think that it's just kind
of time for it to go it has nothing to
do with the fact that it's like
drugstore or whatever it's just this
product I think I just feel like it's
gone bad even though powders don't
normally go bad but I feel like this one
needs to go it's a good one I feel like
bronzers have come pretty far so it's
not like the only thing out there
anymore but you know this is a bronzer
from Milani this is the color sunset 0-8
and this is kind of it's a matte bronzer
but it has a little bit of a sheen to it
it is a baked product I mean I don't
think it's just like 100 percent flat
matte I feel like it has like a really
nice satin it's not - glowy it just is
nice it's like a skin finish really nice
this was a domed product but I have kind
of made the dome go I have used this
quite a bit I really like this color on
myself although I mean the girl at work
was kind of a rude one no one liked her
but um she was like kind of rude to me
when I wear this one Dame is like your
makeup usually looks so good but it's
like orange today and I was like oh cool
thanks like you never tell me my makeup
looks good any day but the day that I
wear this you tell me that almost the
time it is but today it Scrappy's anyway
I don't know why I'm telling you that
story but you know I feel like that's
made me stay away from this which is
stupid because I like it and I don't
care but I need to bust this out more
for sure I think those were limited
edition which i think is so lame cuz
they're really nice but if you've found
them or if you have them they're really
good I only have a couple more this is
one from Dior and as you can tell this
is like the orangist bronzer I own this
is in the color honey tan 0:02 this has
like a like a little bit of a golden
glitter to it the glitter is very very
fine so it's not something that would
turn me away from this it's just a very
orange product it's kind of hard to work
with something about it has just maybe
not be able to get rid of it I want to
make it work so badly like like I wanted
time for
this to work so I'm gonna again keep it
through summer see if I can make it work
it is SuperDuper orange though kind of
mortgage look at it it's pretty much but
yeah that's the one from do you are that
I have this is the it cosmetics CC
radiance ombre bronzer when this came
out I was really excited about it I
thought it was such a pretty concept and
cool I have hit the tiniest amount of
pan amount of pan geez up here in the
corner it's really pretty this is a
darker bronzer I think it's nice I feel
like mine though is like unproportioned
with the bronzer to highlight like it's
like highlight highlight highlight
bronzer only I don't know if like it's
more of like a overlay spray in the
middle but I do like the highlighter in
this as well I think it's really nice
this is something I kind of want to bust
out and just hit some more pan in so
yeah but I definitely got my money's
worth I feel like out of this product I
use it all the time I have one more
powder bronzer this one is from the balm
this is Bahama Mama this is the darkest
bronzer I own it's another matte one but
this one is like a greeny Brown bronzer
there it is at the bottom there so
compared to all the tones you can
definitely see a difference I just
haven't been brave enough for this this
is this one I I want to like go into
this after I kind of finish up the ones
in my Smashbox trio cuz I'm just so
close to those I just wanna I think I
should probably just stick to them and
get them done I just want to see if it
works for me before I get rid of it
hopefully I can get it to work I know I
feel like it's like everyone knows about
it but like who uses it who uses product
um that's how it feels to me anyway but
you know that's just me the next two I
have our cream bronzers and I only have
two and I'm almost done with one I'm so
proud of myself
this one is from Bourjois this is the
kind of like dupe for the Chanel one
this is the bronzing primer I am so
close to being done with this I have
really enjoyed using this product I'm
not gonna like miss it because it's just
like an extra step I do every day and I
want something like this in my
collection at all times just because
it's nice but I've had this for too long
that's why I'm using it up and I'm just
really happy that I'm like
using it like a whole cream bronzer are
you kidding me that's like amazing but
this is a really good one it blends out
so nicely I will leave a link to my
sweet peach get ready with me where I
use this product and I put it on pretty
dang heavy but it blends out like a
dream so it doesn't even matter because
it's kind of like a primer it's not
super opaque and hard to blend out which
makes it just so easy to use I really
like this I would potentially repurchase
it which is kind of crazy the last kind
of like bronzer contour type product I
have this is from nude Stix and it is in
the color deep 8 it's a concealer but
you can use it to contour I've used this
a couple times and it is really nice it
blends out really nice I really like
nude sticks as a brand that's what it
looks like it's the deepest concealer
that they have and yeah I've really
liked it I got a lot of gratis from nude
sticks when I used to work at this one
beauty store cuz we sold it and I really
like I do where I really like their
products and that will be the contour
and move on to like the cream contour I
move on to next after I finished the
Bourjois one well we've made it to the
end of my bronzers guys that's
everything I hope you enjoyed this
collection video I did my bronzer
collection and highlight collection a
little bit different than my blush one
just because I thought it'd be nice so
let me know which format you like if you
like it close-up on the products or if
you like me like actually talking about
it and being on camera also let me know
what part of my collection you'd like to
see next and yeah I will see you on my
next video I hope you're having a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
