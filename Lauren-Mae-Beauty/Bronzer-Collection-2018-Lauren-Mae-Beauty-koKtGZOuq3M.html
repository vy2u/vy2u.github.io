Lauren thank you so much for watching it
today we're gonna be going back into my
collection series and today we're gonna
be looking at all of my bronzers I will
leave the playlist link down below if
you want to check out the other ones
I've done so far for this series I'm not
decluttering anything and I'm not trying
to brag in any way I just want to show
you guys what I have in my collection as
well as rediscover things in my
collection and have a better
appreciation for the things that I do
have so that is what this is I'm going
to show you guys all the bronzers I have
I'm gonna do some swatches for you guys
and give you some mini thoughts as we go
along so yeah let's just get into the
bronzers alright the first bronzer that
I have here is the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer as you can tell I've used
up a lot of this product this is one of
my all-time favorite products and
bronzers it's kind of hard to swatch it
but this is a very light swatch of it
what I love about it is it is such a
light bronzer so you can get just like a
really nice glowy look without it being
too shimmery without it being too
noticeable so that's my butter bronzer I
do have another Physicians Formula
bronzer this is the bronze booster in
the shade medium dark I obviously picked
this up on sale on clearance at Target
and this is something that isn't my
favorite bronzer I keep it around
because I'm gonna try it in the summer
and see if it works better for me then
my hands a little wet so that's a swatch
of it
there it's still pretty sheer but when I
used to use this I don't know it just
didn't work out for me I'm hoping though
that I have a better like application of
bronzer method now I tend to go kind of
heavy so I'm hoping this is something in
the summer I can kind of figure out if I
like it better now that I apply my
bronzer a little bit lighter next this
is a product from benefit this is the
hoola light and this is something that I
picked up because it is a bit lighter
obviously than the original hoola I've
hit pan on it so I've gotten a lot of
good use out of this product this isn't
something that I think I would
repurchase once I finish it
that's a swatch of it there and it's
it's very light which I really enjoy
it's not too warm toned or cool toned
which is nice I just tend to like my
butter bronzer better so I think that's
what I would pick over this but I'm glad
I tried it out and I do enjoy it and I
will fit
next I have a pretty big bronzer here
this is the FC Lauder bronze goddess I
got this off of octa Lee and this one is
a bit more red toned than the other ones
it has a bit of a shimmer to it but it's
really really beautiful I also really
enjoyed this bronzer and I love that you
get so much product in it my hands a
little wet so I don't know how well
swatching bronzers is kind of a weird
thing to do but that's a swatch of it
they're really nice again it has that
little bit of a glow to it but I find on
the skin it just looks really nice and
it doesn't look like overly shimmery so
that is the SA Lauder bronze goddess I
guess we'll go with the next big one
this is from Kiko it's from their golden
waves collection I do have a review on
this they sent this out to me and this
is in the number-three shade so it's a
little bit darker again it has a bit of
like a red undertone it's still super
like a warm toned bronzer but it still
has a little bit of red and not just
watch it there again it has that same
shimmer quality it's actually very
similar to the Estee Lauder so if you
were wanting the si water you might want
to check this one out it's a bit cheaper
but that is the Kiko one that I have
next this is the laura geller baked
impressions bronzer it's pretty beat up
I really enjoyed this one this is a
matte bronzer and I find this looks
really great on fairer skin tones
because it doesn't pull too orange
there's a very light swatch of it there
my hand overall looks shimmery but it's
not it's just the way my skin looks in
the light but anyway that's a very like
light swatch of it obviously I've hit
pan on this I've used this a time I do
really enjoy it I'm not sure if I'd
purchase it again but I do enjoy it and
I'm glad that I've gotten some great use
out of it next is a bronzer from number
7 they sent this out to me from octoly
and this is in the shade golden sand
this one's really nice as well it's
looking a little bit more warm in the
monitor but it's honestly not too too
warm
that's a swatch of it there that's the
laura geller and that's it so it's it's
nice I do enjoy this I haven't gotten as
much use out of it
I wish I had only because I've been
using the other ones more and been
trying to hit pan on those all year but
I have been enjoying this and I can't
wait to kind of get a little bit more
use out of this one
these next two bronzers are ones that I
feel like are a little bit too dark for
me this one from CIT London was sent out
to me this is the bamboo bronzer in
South Beach which i think is their
darker shade instead of the lighter one
it does have a bit of a shimmer running
through it I've only used this one time
so I really can't give you too much ever
review so that's what I want to test out
a few more times but honestly I feel
like just in general the deepness of
this it just because I'm so fair it can
easily get a little out of control and
there's a swatch of that one for you you
can see that golden sparkle in there not
sure how that translates so that's one
that needs a little bit more testing and
as a little dirt and this other one here
is from colour-pop this is in California
Dreaming these come in their own pan and
then you put them into the compact so
that's what it looks like trying not to
blind you with the mirror this on the
website I thought was a little bit I
don't know I just thought it was
different it has a definite shame to it
you can see that there I haven't really
used it much I can't give you too much
of a review on this one either it's a
newer one in my collection but that one
is from colour-pop and my last two
powder bronzers are actually not
bronzers they're just face powders that
are too dark for me this first one from
Wet n Wild is in the shade golden tan
and it's their photo focus pressed
powder I really enjoyed this one I think
it's really really nice it is a bit warm
on me once I blend it you know into the
skin but I think it's really really
pretty it just adds a nice glow and I
really like the finish of this powder
it's a very like satin skin like finish
so I enjoy that and then this is a newer
one from covergirl this is the vitalist
healthy powder and this is in the shade
medium beige they only have four shades
of this powder and I think that's
ridiculous this one is definitely darker
than the other one this one I want to
try out in this summer and really see
how this bronze is up my skin but I do
like the way this powder looks it's very
a smoothing
and beautiful so I saved this one for a
bronzer and last year I have to like
cream products I'm one's more of like a
contour one's more of a bronzer you guys
have seen me talk about the milk makeup
stick quite a bit on my channel this is
in the shade baked they do have two
different shades I freaking love this it
blends into the skin absolutely
beautifully it's just so beautiful if
you're looking for a cream bronzer how
they suggest this one I've enjoyed it so
so much and then this other one here is
from Jordana
it's the sculpting glow I'd have it in
zero one light I believe it comes in
three shades this is a lot more cool
toned as you can tell here so this is
better for a contour for me and this is
something I actually do use and enjoy
quite a bit as well it's not too dark
and it's easy to blend out so you don't
get anything too crazy so I really do
enjoy both of those I feel like I have a
nice amount of those like cream type of
products I don't use them all the time
this I use quite a bit actually but I
don't use them all the time these to
work really well alright guys so those
are all my bronzers and contour things
at least at the moment I honestly don't
feel like I have too many it's 13
products which I mean I guess I could be
better there are a few that I
potentially could get rid of but this
one's almost out and overall for someone
who is a makeup enthusiast and makeup
artist I feel like this is a pretty good
amount of bronzers let me know if you
have any favorites in the comments that
you think I would like I would love to
know bronzers are one of my favorite
makeup products I think they just add so
much life and so much dimension and just
radiance to the skin they can just do so
much and I love them so let me know your
favorites in the comments and that is
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
