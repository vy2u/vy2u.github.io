exploring thanks so much for watching we
are moving on with my cutthroat
declutter hopefully right and we are
moving on to browsers today if you
haven't watched my other two clutters
I'm going to link them down below so you
can check them out there also be a
playlist the entire inspiration behind
this is just to move out things that are
too old things that I've had for way too
long that need to go and also to try not
to let the fact that I never makeup
artists and have a kit keep me from
holding on to things that most likely
I'm not even going to use in my kit but
it's just like a safety blanket so
anyway these are all the bronzes that I
have from my kit from my personal
collection and I'm gonna try to do a
really really good job of getting rid of
the things that I don't like that I
don't use yeah this one hopefully should
go fast we'll see first off right here
from the beginning this is a pixie
bronzer I got this from a friend and I'm
not going to use it it's very shimmery
and if I wanted a shimmery bronzer I
could use my highlighters from honest
Alvia in like darker colors to get the
same look some in a so I guess I'll just
like to get rid of one so we can have
this and shot I don't know this is
something newer to my collection this is
the Laura Geller and it's the based
impressions bronzer and it's really
really nice I'm gonna keep this either
for myself or for my kid I don't care
either one but I really do like a liar
bronzer I don't really like a dark
browser I am fair and I don't like the
look of looking too even though my old
videos you can go back on the log like I
mean taste change in style changes but
I'm trying to really just like embrace
this subtle like I saw look more
European I guess like I'm wearing makeup
but am I and like I just look fresh I
really like that look right now this is
a face powder that I use as a bronzer
from Wet n Wild and it gives me a very
similar like you know glow from within
kind of bronze I'm going to keep this
you can tell like the top of the powders
worn down I do really like it this is
something from laura geller it's the
Tahitian glow bronzer I kept this for a
really long time again just in case like
I wanted to have that glowy look I just
don't think I'm going
you that I love more dela stuff so
that's like really what's tempting me
but I've had this for so long and I
never use it I have quite a few bran
just to work through someone to pass
this on this is the bombs Bahama Mama
and this is a pretty dark bronzer it's
definitely too dark for me and I feel
like it's just not even really the type
of tone I would use in my kit it's kind
of old so yeah I'm going to pass this on
I don't want that I have to cream
contours in here so this first one is
from hard candy it's a highlight and a
contour stick I actually want to try to
use this up it's not very old I recently
bought it I did like a hard candy first
impressions I'll leave a link down below
if you want to check it out so I'm going
to keep this line and then this is the
jordana sculpting go and again I don't
have any in my personal kit besides the
other one which I'm hoping to use up so
I do want to keep this this is a nice
color if you're looking for just like
you know something to kind of give you a
really light look which is again what
I'm looking for so I'm going to keep
that okay guys I got rid of almost half
of that like three one one in it so I
feel very good about that
we're moving on to the big container
here first off I have the butter
bronzers I love the butter bronzer I
have had one in the past I've dropped it
and broke it so I bought any one and
then I have a backup so I'm obviously
going to keep both of these this is
definitely probably my favorite bronzer
out of everything I own I just think
it's so nice yeah I just want this this
is something I bought because the target
I want you to originally get the butter
bronzer as a replacement didn't have the
butter bronzer so I bought this is on
clearance I am going to keep it it's a
little bit darker so it's a nice one for
like summer potentially or whatever it's
not as good as the butter bronzer I will
tell you that but I do still like it I
think it's still a good bronzers going
to keep that especially if you have a
little bit darker skin this is the it
cosmetics bronze ombre bronzer radiance
I obviously like this quite a bit used a
lot of it up I'm just not going to use
it it's getting old and I'm not going to
use it in my kit it's just too deep for
me now like No thank you so I'm going to
get rid of that this is my Dior bronzer
and if kept this for a while but I
actually really like using this Katie
likes to have a warm warm bronzer on she
really likes like a lot of warmth
her face she lost a lot of blood she
likes to have those like popped out
features and this is something that I
can give her that really warm glow Asst
so I'm going to keep that in my kit like
I have been this is from along and this
is one of their baked matte bronzer
agree these were limited edition and I'm
going to take this I want this down
quite a bit I think this is a really
nice like again subtle bronzer so this
is something I want to try to like use
up and finish so yeah keeping up I have
two big bronzers over here this one is
for more lon and it's nice I don't I
don't know I just haven't really used it
on myself because it's a little orange I
feel like I'm going to pass this on I
didn't take worried my friend gave it to
me because it would like her skin tone
she looks going to bronze me it's nice
if you want has a light you know bronzer
but I just feel like I have other things
in my collection that would give it and
I asked me carry this big thing around
so I'm gonna passes on this is from
Sephora and this is the sole Del Rio
bronzer it's really nice I panned a lot
of this um I feel kind of on the fence
about this guy I hate that it crumbled I
feel like I can't like do anything with
it
I have other holy grails bronzer as well
so I think I'm actually going to get rid
of this I wasn't expecting to do that
but it's just inconvenient at this point
it's older and I just have new gloves
and I'm holding onto this because of a
past lower hat for it and it's okay that
it's in the past and I used to love it
so I'm gonna pass it on I have to like
contouring pallets from wet and wild I I
recently got these these aren't like old
but I don't know how I feel about them
this one is like the lighter shade has
like the more cool toned powder I don't
know um they're very soft but it's like
I don't know how I feel about it I like
this one for like under the I like the
lighter one so I think I'm going to keep
this one for myself and then this one I
don't really need the yellow cuz I have
a loose banana powder in my kit so in
plus I'm not going to bust out what and
while so I'm going to pass this one on
it won't fit me so there's no reason
this is my as you long she bronzer and I
love this if I use in my
and it's absolutely beautiful I would
use out myself if I didn't use it on
clients it's beat up because I use it
all the freaking time it gives such a
beautiful natural radiance to the skin
well bronzing it highly suggest this if
you're looking for something more
natural I will need to repurchase one of
these probably sometimes I don't know by
the end of the year next year then tell
them and hoping I can use it up because
I honestly is that much it's just
absolutely beautiful I love it and the
last thing here this is my contour kit
from honest raffia this is also beat up
and I use this in my kit
it's the only contour kids like proper
contour kit that I have I would love to
get the cap on d1 just have it so I have
within new one but until then I will
keep this and continue using it to
contour people so everything I have now
fits in just this one drawer I'm really
happy about that and then this is
everything I'm getting rid of I'm
getting rid of one two three four five
six seven bronzers that is amazing I'm
very proud of myself and I don't think I
will miss me some of these are a little
harder for me but I really don't think
I'm going to miss them and something
that's really exciting about this and
just being more real with myself
is that I am freeing up my collection
not that I want to go out and buy a ton
of things but let's say I'm very
selective and I take one thing I want to
add to my collection it's like a more
special thing and I can put it in a
special home not amongst all these other
products that I just don't really care
for I can put it with like all its
friends and it's my other love I don't
know I I know it's kind of weird to
think about but I'm definitely just
really happy with it so that's
everything for this blushes or nuts I
hope you guys are enjoying the series
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
