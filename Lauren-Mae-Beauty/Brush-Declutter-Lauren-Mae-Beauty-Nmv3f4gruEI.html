learn this is gonna be a brush to
clutter I have pulled out every brush I
own I believe this is everything so I
even went through my kit and pulled out
those brushes as well I really wanted to
do a deep cleaning of my brushes not as
I'm actually like cleaning them but
nothing just going through them getting
rid of some you get so many brushes
through palettes and then different
things and I just feel like I can
definitely pare down my collection get
it to a place that is just the brushes I
need and then the rest can kind of just
find different homes I'm the type of
person that usually sticks to the same
brushes I know they work for me I like
how I use them and I continue to use
just those ones and then I might switch
it up every now and then with like one
new brush but I don't need I feel like
quite a few of these so let's see if we
can get some of these to clutter it I'm
going to clear these out and we'll start
one by one I don't have a ton of space
on my cards I'm gonna try to like whip
through these I'm gonna start with this
one first because I want to end up
putting my brushes I don't want in here
just to kind of dump them all out
there's like some random stuff I'm gonna
get rid of this benefit brush this is a
real techniques brush I'm gonna keep it
I do like it I'm gonna get rid of this
bareMinerals brush this little kabuki
thing I got off of all cuz no I got this
off of coastal signs I'm gonna get rid
of that this is a Luxy brush that I got
at generation beauty and already this
has come off and I haven't even washed
this I do think this is a nice quality
like actual brush so what I think I'm
gonna do is just like glue this one back
on I feel like it's worth it because I
do like the quality of the top but I
need to definitely like do that sooner
rather than later I have a little rms
brush I'm gonna pass that along q-tips
throw away this is a little dior brush
I'm gonna get rid of I feel like most of
this stuff is just like little crappy
things that I've had for a long time so
most of them I am getting right up
another bareMinerals little brush this
is like a NARS brush I'm getting rid of
this is an honest ah salon I'm gonna get
rid of a benign one this is a another
benefit one and this is nice quality but
I've never used it I've held onto it
thinking I will and I have them they get
rid of it this is a Kevin of Kwan brush
that's actually been passed on to me it
does feel
nice and I don't have much like this so
I'm gonna keep just this one and get rid
of all the others so that means this one
is going goodbye it's like a physician's
formula one keeping the pen and keeping
the shadow insurance since I'm almost
done with it so far
success is happening I'm gonna pour out
all these ones these are the ones that I
use in my kit so I'm not sure how many
I'm gonna want to get rid of but we'll
see I am gonna keep this big powder
brush from Real Techniques it's really
good I'm also gonna keep this other
powder brush that I have these are like
the two I really like this is one of my
favorite blush brushes so I'm going to
keep this it's from Coastal Sun it's a
long time ago another one of my favorite
brushes this is the elf complexion brush
so great I'm also keeping this I got
this off of ebay if I can find the link
I'll link it down below this brush it's
really crappy I had a rush video where I
like called a bunch of brushes I'm gonna
get rid of this just because it looks so
bad there's no way I should keep this in
my kid and I found that you know the
metal since it's not like good metal is
like leaking into the brushes so I'm
just getting rid of that I have these
two brushes here these are just stains
they are clean but I'm gonna keep both
of them I use them for like lip brushes
or sometimes uses for liner depending so
I'm going to keep those I feel like
fluffy brushes are my favorite brushes
so I probably will keep most of those so
I'm gonna keep these three different
ones this is like a Mirabella this is a
royal and langnickel and this is a
Coastal Scents I have this elf brush I'm
gonna keep that as well I'm gonna keep
these three brushes I like to use this
really concealer in different things
this is a good one for like lower
lashline and I like to use this just for
whatever inner corner detail work last
for brushes sorry I'm just like going
through this guy's this is a angled
brush I'm going to keep that I like all
of these actually I really like these
ones from Urban Decay becoming the
palette so I'm gonna keep them and then
this is another one from Real Techniques
and I do like a I'm gonna keep it like
do these brushes these are kind of like
scary because somebody
yeah hopefully this is in focus I'm
really sorry if it's not this is a
powder brush that I got at the beginning
of this year I'm gonna keep it I do like
it it's a natural hair which makes it
different than the other ones I like
using this to really buff in powder so
I'm going to keep that yet another
powder brush I'm gonna get rid of this
one though
I just sheds it's not my favorite I just
like the other ones better so I'm gonna
get rid of it I have a bunch of brushes
like this and they all do that so I'm
gonna get rid of all of them I don't
like them I don't need them they suck I
don't recommend them I got them off of
ebay and I really hate them so I'm gonna
get rid of all of those this is a
contour brush this is dirty from Sigma
and I like it I'm gonna keep it this is
a brush that got passed on to me from
Sonia Kashuk
I don't really like it I haven't used it
yet and I don't think I will something
to pass it along I have this fake fan
brush and on eBay I do like it and I
don't have anything like this so I'm
gonna keep it I have a small fan brush
from ELF I do like this and I'm gonna
keep it as well this is a really nice
brush I use it to highlight and it's
from Real Techniques I'm gonna keep it
this is a brush that is not my favorite
I really don't like these brushes I feel
like I hard to clean I don't man I'm
gonna pass it I think this is a brush I
don't even know where it's from but it's
like the shape of it is so psycho I'm
gonna cut it I'm gonna cut it I'm gonna
pass it I like this brush femoral neck
blank nickle I like it to like stamp
product on the outer corner I'm gonna
keep it this is a brush that I like as
well it's just like a fluffier angled
brush I'm gonna keep it brow gel keeping
that not a brush this is another one of
those Urban Decay brushes I'm gonna keep
this one
it's from the Vice Ltd okay I have two
more brushes here this is a SOHO brush
and I do like this for blending so I'm
gonna keep that and then this last brush
here is from Coastal Scents and it's
just like a liner brush it's not very
detailed it's not good to do actual
liner with but I do think I'm gonna keep
it just for like more special effects
type of stuff sometimes brushes like
this are nice to have aren't you're not
scared you're gonna like ruin so I'm
going to keep that but I'm going to move
it out of like my stuff into special
let's tackle this big one here this has
like the most brushes in it
I'm really hoping to maybe downsize but
also it's like some of these I do like I
guess I don't know this is a brush
that's like duo-fiber
it's from Sephora it's pretty dang
beat-up I didn't realize but I am going
to keep this I really like this for
blush and powder and all that this is
one of those royal and langnickel
brushes and it comes apart like that so
I'm going to get rid of it there is no
reason to have this I'd rather just use
disposable schoolies for the most part
anyway I can just tell you right now I'm
gonna be keeping all of these brushes
these are from Real Techniques well the
middle one is this one these ones are
from eBay again I'll have that linked if
I can find it down below they're really
great brushes for the price I think I
got all of them for 99 cents although I
know the price has gone up on them but
they're really good something to keep
all of those the only thing I don't like
about those brushes is that the handles
at the bottom are like bigger so in like
a brush roll or even in a container like
that it just takes up a lot of room
another brush from Real Techniques
obviously I really like them I'm gonna
be keeping this this is an honest Asya
brush I just recently got this and I am
gonna keep it it's really nice and soft
I like it this is a brush from ELF that
I really like again for highlight it's a
mineral powder brush I'm gonna keep it I
have this Tarte brush here I don't ever
use this I don't really like it I'm
gonna pass it along same with this one
this is from Sonia Kashuk I got it in
the same set as that powder brush I'm
just not using it as much as I feel like
I should so I'm gonna pass this one
along this is a fan brush it's a little
bit different than that elf one but it's
just not very good I just don't really
like this brush so I'm gonna get rid of
it here's a grouping of brushes I'm
gonna keep these two are the same brush
and they're just good for like all over
shadow to blend out concealer I don't
know just different things I like to
have them this is a brush I'll tease for
shadow as well as like highlighting
under the brow bone specifically I
really like that so I'm gonna keep it
this first years like my Holy Grail this
one by sigma it's the f no this is the
e-40 i love it i blend with this
everyday i love it so much
i would love to get more obviously
keeping i have another one of those soho
brushes i'm gonna keep that this is a
little like smudger shader brush i love
i'm going to keep
I don't have anything like it these
aren't actually brushes these are too
like cleanup product out of things so
you can use every last bit I'm gonna
keep these these are from the Container
Store I'll leave a link down below this
is a fake NARS brush and I really
haven't tried it enough so I'm gonna
keep it and just see how much I like it
although I will say I do like like the
Anasazi oh one better just cuz it's
rounded I feel like you can get a better
edge but I still don't feel like I've
used it enough to pass it so I want to
keep it this is a little Anasazi brush
and I really like the blending side but
it's like just not that good of quality
and this side squeak so I'm just gonna
pass it along I have this weird little
sponge tip thing but it's like a week
I'm getting rid of that that is just
going to be thrown away no one needs it
these are some fluffier angled brushes
these are great for blending out shadow
on the lower lash line and kind of
making a little bit more blown out so
I'm going to keep both of those this is
a brush that's kind of weird it's like a
sponge tip but I do actually use it so
I'm going to keep it these are two more
brushes I'm gonna add to the special
effects pile so they're not gonna be in
my everyday stuff but I'll still have
them this is one of my favorite brushes
as well
I love applying base shadow with it so
like a cream matte shade all over the
eyelid I love this I'm gonna keep it
this is a brush I've had forever if you
wanna tell you forever I mean it so I'm
gonna get rid of that I never use it
this is a little shadow brush from ELF
it's great quality for the price for a
doll hair yes I'm gonna keep it we're
getting to the nitty-gritty here okay
this is a maybelline little brush i'm
gonna get rid of that these are like my
two eyebrow brushes I'm gonna keep both
of them this is my absolute favorite I
love this brush so much it is from
Coastal Scents Forever Ago
I love it love it love it never will get
rid of it I'll do it back together every
time it's never fallen apart but if it
does I will glue it back together this
is one from Stila and it has a spoolie
and then again a nice angle I'm gonna
keep this one and those are my two brow
brushes I'm gonna add this to the
special effects pile oh no this is good
actually I'm gonna keep this in my kit
brushes because it's about 91 it's
pretty good this is an Ulta brow brush I
hate this brush it's so scratchy it's so
bad it's way too big to get a nice
precise brow getting rid of that me
are all Urban Decay brushes I'm going to
keep all of them I do really like them
and yeah I'm gonna keep them this is a
Red King brush and part of me wants to
keep this I don't know like for my kit
or something I don't know I just really
like the shape of it I know I won't use
it in my like daily routine but I might
use it on my kit so I think I'm going to
keep it this is like a pimple popper
thing I got it at Dyson or die so die so
it's like a Japanese store I believe or
Korean store I'm not sure but it's like
a dollar store but everything's a dollar
fifty so it's really a dollar fifty
store I'm eating rid of this it sucks it
doesn't work I'm gonna put this in my
special-effects brushes this is not it
we have one more thing just kidding
I'm definitely keeping my Sigma brush I
do like it I recently used it this is
hard this is so hard I think I'm gonna
get rid of this Sohail brush the cut on
it's not my favorite and I don't use it
much and then I'm gonna keep this Tarte
one which is similar but smaller this is
my only like pencil brush in my stash so
I'm gonna keep it this is kind of a
weird brush oh no it's like bent okay
I'm just gonna get rid of it this is a
little spatula I'm keeping that out of
these brushes I think I'm gonna keep
these three and get rid of this one I
have used this but the cut is disastrous
it's so bad and it probably should just
pass it okay guys it's going pretty well
I'm pretty happy that I've already
cleaned out what I have these are all
ways that are in my kit so I'm not image
for what's in here because I don't
always use every brush and like it you
know I'm probably gonna keep most of
these but we'll see I'm seriously just
going through it like this because I'm I
think I'm just gonna keep everything I
like everything it's pretty curated for
my kit specifically yeah I'm gonna keep
all of these actually give me one second
I'm gonna be right back guys I think
there might be one other place that I
have brushes I remembered correctly I do
have this brush roll I used to keep this
in the bottom of my kit and I haven't
reached into it for a while so I'm gonna
pull everything out and see what I want
to keep so I can tell you right now all
these brushes are nice actually
I don't know I'm not using this I'm just
gonna get rid of its a powder brush but
again it's like you can tell that the
metal is gross and turning the bristles
this is something I like I don't really
have anything quite like it so I'm gonna
keep it I really like this brush for
bronzer I'm gonna keep it this is just a
nice just overall brush on the key I'm
gonna keep things I have these two
double ended Ecotools brushes I'm gonna
keep these I really haven't used them
much but it's because they've been in my
kit and I haven't been able to I'm gonna
keep on this is just a nice shader brush
when you keep it and then this one I
don't know it's kind of like a pointed
crease brush I'm gonna keep it too and
this is like the most unique brush I
have I think I'm gonna keep this one
it's soft I like it that was my brush
declutter I know it went fast I don't
even know if you guys like stayed up
with me because I was just moving
through but I'm really happy I did this
I just wanted to at least film it
because I've been wanting to do this
video for a long time and I'm just glad
I took the time today did it and I can't
wait to pax all of these brushes on or
throw them away or whatever I need to do
with them to get them out of my life
it's just a little less clutter I hope
you guys enjoyed that's everything I'll
see you in my next video hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
