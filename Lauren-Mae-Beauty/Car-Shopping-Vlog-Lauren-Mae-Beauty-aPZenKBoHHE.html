kind of like well maybe we'll just buy a
versa
I don't know so anyway we're gonna be
going and looking at cars today we've
never no show aggression we're going to
go to actual like car dealerships and
we've never done that before we've
always just like done the whole cash
transaction met someone online
and it worked for us but we ain't got
that cash right now so we got we got
pre-approved and we're gonna see what we
can find
we don't know if it'll be good first
we're gonna get some breakfast burritos
though it'll be interesting I don't know
how we're gonna do at these dealerships
that's I feel like you'll all receive
your peoples bullcrap real fast
yeah I am going to spike him I'm going
to show you all the cards they look at
one today okay my arm is in such a
workout this freakin hurts do you hear
that excited for food oh my gosh
talk about your tattoos show us your
tattoo oh yeah oh you took the one off
your neck
Pasadena California of any person water
goods and burritos it's a really fancy
place they have a chandelier and that's
the menu no cheese in my burrito look
how big this is it oh babe so cheese is
trying to hang stores in China they all
sell cheese don't really choose that
much in China fun fact of the day my
Executive MBA program so we're just
sitting here enjoying but I just wanted
to show you a look at all that bacon

hey pretty good unfortunately it looks
like we'll have to go with the later one
I'm not gonna make it by the 2:45 later
if that's any indication of how this is
going to go why did the person make you
go to the wrong person
hey this is a UN job oh hey this is
someone you never talked to we're just
rolling in that's all all right look
yeah we're gonna go down the trellis for
ten G's right all right we're about to
drive out to the middle of Satan's
desert I think your friend
oh really that's a Mexican it's all the
chili peppers why don't you just wait
but you don't care like I'm already over
it's fine
all right so we just got to the
dealership for a Hyundai and we already
have a vulture oh I feel like prey I
feel like Frank I feel like praying you
like carrion flush sing little do they
know we're just shooting a prank video
social experiment on them so we're not
really gonna buy a car we're gonna
social them let's go
okay we're at the dealership and we're
gonna be sitting in cars really soon
well they just turn the music I was
gonna tell you the music we listened to
it like Nine Inch Nails yeah sweet I
have it on camera finally right now
we're trying out this car and they're
trying to give us the runaround a bit
yeah just like classic car sales
assessment true look at Sam's knee being
six - man they really just don't want to
go alright next car and we're gonna try
a little baby Kia Forte well it's like
this
I don't know it's a smoker car someone's
walked in as fire knows we're in the Kia
Forte now and we're just testing this
one I like it better than the last one
but I'm still not this is just not fun I
thought this was gonna be more fun
horrible I hate this I wish I just had
my old crappy car that worked anyway
it's probably all I'm gonna show these
stupid dealerships because I just I'm
getting so dizzy irritated by it there
are some good things about this
number one okay okay we just left the
second dealership and it went super well
that was much more smooth just a
straightforward little told this what we
wanted and then he went looked at the
used car list showed us one and what do
you know it was the specifications we
were hoping for the actual year all that
without saying no give us the runaround
I'm telling Cherie back to the other one
okay you're easily they saw some of the
first stage of this circus of a place
you can see it's getting darker out now
we were there like three hours at that
other place we were there a long time
yeah and they just wasted our time a lot
and showed us new crap you know they did
the car dealership thing and it was
fresh fruity yes dude was just chill
like he was like I don't want you to
think about price I'm like which car do
you want any car you want which one I
think though that makes sense
schizophrenic
yeah and he's like I don't want you
don't think about price price doesn't
matter I'm like and Sam's like to use
really good
I have a new one if you watch our movies
no it might be a new background so we
might lose some of our floor subscribers
okay we hope they stick around
we hope this background is an upgrade
one's me
so we're depending on you subscribers if
we lose one that's half of our unknown
subscribers no way guys I will leave our
I'll leave our channel salmon stream
down below if you want to check it out
we do it's all movie reviews right now
but we'll probably post other stuff it's
just I spend obviously a lot of time on
this channel putting up a lot of videos
so we're working on it
anyway that's in the vlog here I think
you know maybe we'll get some shots of
that new car we're gonna do an
inspection an inspection of it tomorrow
