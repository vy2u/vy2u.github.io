learn thank you so much for watching
we're gonna do it get ready with me
today and this is going to be a
monochromatic pink look I was sending
some single shadows from kiss New York
professional six to be exact and I've
been wanting to create a look with them
so of course the pink one was really
calling to me I actually just opened it
today and swatched it and I was not as
blown away with it as I wanted to be the
texture of it is like very dimethicone
II I mean it's nice don't get me wrong
these retail for $4 but we'll see how it
performs on the eye I have an orange one
I don't know if I'm gonna use that in
this look and then just so you guys know
the yellow I had on my inner corner in
one of my more recent videos was this
one from kiss in the color chaos so yeah
I think I'm just going to focus on the
pink one today and really making a fun
blown out pink look because if you can't
tell I really like pink I do want to do
my eyes first so I'm gonna do my
eyebrows I like to have a frame of where
to put my eyeshadow on my face since my
brows are very blond it's hard to see a
shape without them being filled in so
I'm using kind of my normal products for
this so of course my ELF eyebrow pencil
I'm using that YBF pencil that I use in
my last like demo this is a bit darker
it's a universal color but since it's
dark it's going to give me some nice
definition and I'm really going to want
that with this monochromatic look so
that my eyebrows don't get lost and then
to set my brows in place I'm gonna be
using the black up clear brow gel once
again just because I don't want to add
any more pigment to my eyebrows since
this YBF one is quite dark so I'm gonna
do this I know everyone does that words
like I'm gonna do my eyebrows and I'll
be back but sometimes it takes a while
and also I'm concentrating so much I'm
not gonna be able to talk to you anyway
so I'll be back and then we can get to
the chatting all right brows are on they
look kind of dark because they are when
I have nothing else on my face it look
kind of stark but they will look good
once we have the rest of our face on I'm
going to prime my eyelids I am using the
Maybelline
I primer this isn't my favorite but I
think it works well it keeps my
eyeshadows from creasing which is
ultimately the goal for me so you guys
first thing I want to talk about is the
fact that I like a ton of new
subscribers so hi that is crazy so it
this is the first time I'm filming since
my makeup addiction video has been seen
by a lot more people than it originally
had when I first uploaded that video by
no means is it like viral or anything I
has like maybe 10,000 views at this
point but I've had a lot of new
subscribers coming from that video and
that is really special to me because
that was such a personal video for me to
post and I feel like the content of that
video is very much a core facet of my
channel so it's really exciting to see
so many people connect with that and the
comments are so amazing so many people
just sharing the same thoughts as me and
as much as I thought that that video
would resonate I honestly didn't think
that it would resonate so much with so
many people like I know we have our
project pan and community but it really
makes me think and also is so surprising
that so many people find the beauty
community and the constant buying so
tiring and like taxing and to something
that used to bring joy and now is
bringing kind of like almost stress and
anxiety which is so crazy so hi guys
welcome to my channel I definitely
suggest checking out some more of my
tube talks and checking out some more of
my get ready with me just to kind of get
to know me I guess a little bit I hope
you enjoy the content from this channel
that's be cool let me keep going sorry
I'm moving on to the next step while we
chitchat I'm just taking this matte
cream shade to put all over my eyelid
but anyway I'm suggest checking out some
other videos from me just to get to know
me and kind of like what I am like and
like what my channel is all about
but anyway so subscriber wise I mean I
feel like I just did it get ready with
me where I was saying like oh I might
hit 7000 soon and that'll be exciting
and
I'm already at 8300 which is like what
is happening like it's freaking me out a
little bit it's like what you always
want to happen and then when it's
happening you're just like what's going
on like I'm used to having so much more
time between growing so it's just kind
of strange like it's weird to gain over
like like 200 subscribers in a day like
that's so freaking weird
it's super exciting it's just definitely
odd and and it's funny because it is
what you hope for as a creator like you
want this and so after uploading videos
for like two and a half years and having
steady success along the way to finally
have like my first kind of like jump
I guess our bigger jump is exciting and
new and kind of just weird I think
that's the best way I can describe it is
is just like so weird but exciting and
awesome like I'm texting Sam I'm like
updating him cuz I'm just like what's
going on anyway let's move on to our
crease I'm going to be using orange soda
from is that no this is a color pop
shadow I'm gonna be using a color like
orange soda from Anasazi this is the
color issues and although the eye is
going to be pink I just want a nice warm
transition color so that way we can kind
of have a really nice blend I'm gonna
try really hard to focus on the blend
for this because I don't know I see so
many people as eyeshadows and they blend
them just so well and I um I feel like
I'm pretty skilled like don't get me
wrong but I definitely think my blood
didn't can sometimes be better so that's
what we're really gonna try to focus on
with this eye shadow look so fingers
crossed we can get a nice blend on some
of these shadows I'm really excited to
do just like a full pink eye I don't
think I've ever done something quite
like that so it should look really cool
so anyway I just wanted to say welcome
to all the new subscribers definitely
get to know me a little bit I one of the
things I think that's the biggest like
thing you'll notice about me is I'm not
very active in the comments section I
try but check out my tube talks I'm
gonna leave the playlist linked down
below because you will get to know so
much more about me
and how my brain works from those videos
and just know that I read all the
comments I just don't respond I you know
I try to upload almost daily during the
month of August I uploaded almost daily
and if I don't upload daily I'm usually
uploading every other day so that is a
big part of where I decide to put the
work into my channel on top of that I do
have a bit of anxiety when it comes to
comments and messaging people back in my
real life to them it's like not just
with you guys it's like people will call
me and I just like if I don't answer it
sometimes I just won't answer and I
don't know I'm like have this kind of oh
well I don't want to say crippling
anxiety but um I don't know I have a
like a really weird situation around
phone calls and text messages unless
their friend my husband essentially so
yeah I've always been personals heck
so anyway transition is down I'm really
liking the way that's looking next I
think it's only fair that we go in with
pink like let's do it
I'm gonna be taking my favorite color
savage from the electric palette you can
use any pink that you have the reason
I'm choosing this one is one it's very
bright pink and I like that but also
this tends to be really nice and sheer
and I feel like I can build it up nicely
so I'm going to be putting this in the
crease slightly lower than the peach
shade we just put in totally build up a
transition I might use this on the inner
portion of my oh wow look at that
I really want to figure out how lighting
marks in look at this mirror just
reflecting and giving me a nice balance
anyway I feel like if this pink will be
nice to share out I want to put this on
the lid I think as well like the inner
portion we'll see I just wanted to say
thank you so much thank you for like we
hit 8000 which is like insane I feel
like I didn't even get the chance to
fully take in 7 so when I see 8 next to
my name and the fact that it keeps your
izing it's just it's all very exciting
and very weird and I'm excited I'm super
excited so on top of that would also
have to like kind of update you guys on
Oh last weekend we went on a boat if you
guys follow me on Instagram you saw some
pictures of me on a boat thank you for
all the comments about
being like sexy and my legs being like
ba-ba-boom I was like what's going on
and I didn't realize that this picture
was so um like sexy but I'll take it
I'll take it that was super fun it was
like a four-hour thing and like my
biggest goal was not to get seasick on
the boat like please don't and we were
allowed to bring like stuff onto the
boat so I was like oh should I bring
alcohol and I did bring some and I drank
the tiniest bit but I'm glad I didn't
really have that much and I didn't get
seasick
whew I'm mostly proud of Sam for not
getting seasick he tends to get motion
sickness more than most but we both were
victorious and didn't so I like the way
that this looks I'm hoping it looks
blended on camera because it is pretty
blended in real life I think I'm gonna
go back into issues though and make sure
there aren't any issues with the
blending something else that I wanted to
kind of bring up and just like I was an
update this is like so far back but I
thought it would be nice to bring it up
before that they'll let me go in with
the other shadow I'm going to be using
the kiss shadow in the color dahlias
again these are only four dollars and
that's something I really like about
kiss is that it's so affordable but I
really do think the quality is quite
nice so I'm gonna be taking this and I'm
gonna be putting this basically all over
the lid I might go in with that savage
color in a second we'll see but I'm just
going to tap that off and start putting
this at D on the lip I don't know anyway
for my Z palette tour video that I did I
don't know seven months ago it was a
long time ago
I only did want in my intention was to
do a bunch of them but but I don't know
if that's gonna happen guys and the
reason I'm not going to kind of update
that is just because I have changed
around my palette so much with my let
stupid series and honestly there are
some of the shadows I use the most in my
collection so no longer are they in the
same order and
I don't know I just I also feel like I'm
just at a place where I'm almost storing
them differently like I was storing them
based by color but now I think I'm gonna
store them based on brand I'm not sure
what I'm doing with it so I just wanted
to verbally kind of say that I don't
think they'll be any more videos in that
series or you know it's just kind of
didn't work out so actually I did do two
of those Z palette videos I did the
neutrals I think didn't I and the pinks
and purples or did I just did the things
of our walls maybe I did just do one
it's been on my plate and like something
I've been like having on my to-do list
since I filmed that first video so I
thought I would just talk to you guys
about it and like get it off my plate
and stop worrying about it because I
doubt any of you guys are just like
where's that video Lauren and if you are
I'm really sorry but I don't think it's
coming I'm gonna go in with a different
brush that has a lot of pink on it
because I usually use this to flick
savage into my upper brow but I'm gonna
go in with that color and I'm just going
to be you know really deepening up the
edges of where we lay down that shadow
so we can have a nice blend and I don't
know I just want some more of that
really hot pink and I went in kind of
light at the beginning just to kind of
see what was going on before I just went
crazy but now that we have more of our
shape and more settled I guess in our
look I can kind of pump things up if I'm
being honest I'm not really liking this
shadow too much I was so excited too
because it's pink and again I love pink
but it's just not performing the way I
wanted to I'm going to go in with my
finger and really press the shadow on
hopefully that'll give me some more
pigmentation like I was saying at the
beginning this has a pretty thick
texture kind of like the makeup forever
or more of a dimethicone finish or
formula but it doesn't have a high shine
or anything which I feel like is usually
what those have is they have that so
it's not like the worst shadow it is
pigmented it's just
quite what I was thinking or I mean
maybe wanting but regardless my eyes are
very very pink right now for me the next
step is going to be just kind of
deepening up that outer corner I didn't
know what I wanted to do I have like a
ton of different shadows around me
because I was trying to plan I think I'm
gonna go first in with the love-letter
color from the modern renaissance
palette and just kind of keep that in
the outer corner see what that does with
these other shadows and then we'll go
from there when it comes to deepening it
up what else has been going on with me
I've just been really focusing on
YouTube lately
I feel like as opposed to last year at
this time I was super busy and this year
I'm just I'm not as busy there aren't as
many shows going we had two pilots and
so those were awesome but we don't have
two pilots this year so I'm just kind of
taking it easy focusing on my channel
and I will say something that makes it
just so much fun it is so much fun when
you're curling you know like it makes
you excited and totally you want to put
more into your channel I mean I always
put a ton into my channel and I kind of
always go pretty hard but there's
something about growing that makes it
just so much more fun that it is it's
just so much more fun Oh have you guys
heard the new Taylor Swift single not
look what you made me do but the are you
ready for it oh I am obsessed with that
song it's so good I like it better than
the first single honestly I guess I'm
going there's a little bit more like a
winged out shape I don't know that just
kind of started happening and I I just
embraced it I'm taking savage and I'm
kind of just going over the front
portion just to keep that brightness I
feel like this is not looking very
blended but we'll work on it or work on
it just to kind of get a more of a blend
I'm going in with this just cream shade
right under my brow and just kind of
blending some of those colors back down
and we can always build them back up but
I just I don't know I feel like I'm
getting out of control like I love the
look but I want it to be more blended I
was like my main focus and I'm not
or if it's you know if that's really
happening I think to like it would
almost be a crime if I didn't bring this
hot pink into my brow so I'm just gonna
do it and just go for it so I'm going to
take Savage and I'm going to kind of
keep this front area very pink and bring
it into my brows this will not be
everyone's favorite move
and I understand that it's just kind of
a signature of mine if you guys are new
I really like having disliked colorful
inner brow portion and I like to do that
with pink most of the time but I also do
it with other colors depending on the
look and what's going on yeah I just I
don't know why I just love the way my
eyes look with like the inner portion
colored in I know it looks crazy bare
with me guys I want to add a little bit
more depth I'm going to go in with the
color going study from colour-pop and
that has a little bit more like almost
like a purpley red to it kind of like
love-letter it's very similar to love
letter but I just really want to deepen
up this outer corner and have it
contrast against the like bright pink on
the inside since it is all like one
color I think it's important we're gonna
leave it there I'm gonna clean up under
my eyes with a wipe so we can like see
what's actually happening and then we
will go in with some foundation as well
because I think that's really going to
help tie it together I almost never do
my eyes first because I just feel like
almost I don't want to say ugly cuz I
don't think I'm ugly but I just don't
ever feel satisfied with my look when I
do my eyeshadows first okay I really
like the way that this shape looks and
this one is not the same we are not the
same I am a Martian I don't know why
that is and I don't want to like ruin
the shape of this eye to get this eye
button I might have to him let's just go
in with foundation and primer and all
that good stuff for primary today I'm
using the YSL Touche clot Blair primer I
just really wanted something that was
going to be a nice smooth base for my
skin
it's funny when I used to be more of
like a heavy foundation girl I hated
this because it is a bit more like
slippery and I don't want to say slimy
it's not slimy but just yeah more
dimethicone ii and a thinner texture I
just didn't like that but I've really
been liking it lately because it just is
such a nice almost moisturizing and like
product just glides over it and that's
what I look for in a primer now so I
really like this one I don't think it's
worth the money I think you can find
comparable dupes
but this one is very nice and since I
have it I won't use it I'm like really
obsessed with this look in the monitor
and okay let's talk about my new setup I
am glad you guys like my new background
that's awesome it is very grandma chic
that's way more my style I feel like I
love other people's backgrounds that are
like white and clean and you know
whatever but that's just not me I'm more
collective Morning Becomes eclectic with
me but that was a little NPR reference
in case you didn't know so anyway I do
like more like a thrift stuff and like I
just like more vintage looking stuff so
that's just like a little funky little
weird mix with some newer pieces I don't
know I kind of just I like whatever it's
a mix match it's mismatched yeah
mismatched kind of situation but I think
it looks really nice I don't know I like
my style so I'm glad that you guys kind
of like it too I feel like it's a little
bit better than the couch I'm still
working on lighting I know that's so
boring if you're a new youtuber you're
probably just like shut up about
lighting shut up about the like lawn
blowers and I also understand that okay
you guys this video is gonna be so long
but that's okay I'm using the tint Idol
ultra wear makeup stick from Lancome
that I just got I have really been
liking this I'm also gonna mix it today
though because it is a bit too light for
me but it's gonna be really nice I feel
like in winter I think it's gonna be
like right where I'm at because I feel
like as I get tanner my skin warms up
and when I'm not as tan and don't have
as much color to my face I don't have as
much warmth I just have like pinks from
my blood showing - oh my gosh so with
that I added the vanish stick foundation
from hourglass this is the color linen
and I find that that one is just really
warm and really yellow so I just like to
mix them together and I feel like it
gives me a pretty decent color match
I've basically been using the Lancome
stick since I got it and I have really
been enjoying it it's so easy and that's
what I love about it the most I can pick
my coverage I don't have to use a ton I
can use a lot if I want to and get more
coverage like I just love sticks and
what I loved about this one too is that
it's not very hard to blend out I feel
like stick foundations get kind of a
reputation that they're just hard and oh
not good like you know they're just
heavy and then this one is not heavy and
that's what I love about it the most
it also has sunscreen in it so I did
wear it when we went boating and it was
really nice and I find that honestly I'm
a very oily person but I honestly think
that my skin does not get nearly as oily
when I'm wearing less products on my
face let me know if you guys feel the
same way but like the less I have on my
face the less oily I get so which is
awesome so if I go in with a lighter
foundation or don't put as much product
on my face I find it lasts just as well
if not better with my oily skin then
when I just take on so much product oh
I'm looking go Stewie I'm looking really
pale and one color right now in the
viewfinder I am digging this look that
like I feel like a badass
I could take over the world I love it I
might wear pink smokey eyes every day
now it's
like this or like super neutral those
are my only like functions let's put
some concealer on I'm gonna be using my
Milani erase and retouch I really like
this my all-time favorite concealer is
the Maybelline fit me I just I think the
thing that I love about it cuz I'm
trying to figure out why I don't like
these other ones and it's just it has
coverage but it's also moisturizing I
feel like there's not too much pigment
where it just dries down and looks gross
and that's what I really like about it
I'm also gonna put a little bit more
over this blemish I got a big old pimple
over the weekend well last weekend so
irritating I really can't complain
because I really have pretty nice skin
but this one was massive and it hurt
like when they hurt I feel like anyone
can complain about it cuz that is
horrible it's the worst feeling it's
like right on my lip it's just oh but um
now it's just a red spot because I pick
at it I'm a picker I try not you and my
husband hates it when I pick up stuff
but what can I say I can't help it I
feel like it's part of like you know
anxious tendencies I pick around my face
and it's horrible but I do I also bite
my mouth just anyone else do that this
video is all over the place
woo well I didn't really cover this up
but I might just embrace it as like a
mole even though it's not to set the
center in my face I'm gonna be using my
pro touch kiss professional setting
powder I just use this to set the center
of my face and under my eyes I love that
it's thin it doesn't add like a huge
layer of you know powder but it also
keeps things in place mattifies things i
keeps my eyes from creasing I'm looking
like scary in the behind er I mean not
scary because again I really like this
look I really like the richness of the
Pink's it's not this baby pink look
which is kind of what I had going on
last time but it's like a full on we're
not messing around guys I'm gonna set
the rest of my face with this Revlon
nearly naked powder I'm gonna turn the
arrow and I do not show you guys what
I'm doing so I don't die of heatstroke
we're gonna finish up the face before
going back to the eyes I'm gonna be
using a bronzer this is my Milani
bronzer and I'm just going to be putting
that on the perimeters of my face I
don't like to really seriously contour I
just find that it looks a little bit
harsh on me I have pretty pale skin and
I don't know I just don't feel like I
need it as much I mean I'm bigger so I
probably could use a little contour but
I don't know I would rather look more
natural than look like I have a really
harsh line across my face which I
probably already do that a little bit
like you know but an even harsher line
if I was really trying to make a wine so
I just use bronzer as a way to kind of
like give some dimension back to the
face it so it's not just one color I
like to bronze my forehead a lot because
I'm like losing my hair decides a day
but it's true I have like coldest that
going on almost and I'm 25 and then I
like to add a little bit on to the nose
because it just adds some dimension
there I don't really need like a ton of
contouring I don't think but I think it
just kind of brings some warmth not just
on the perimeters for whatever reason I
didn't bring out a blush our highlight
so I'm gonna go pick one of those out
really fast and I'll come back for blush
I'm just keeping it really simple we're
gonna go in with the Clinique cheek
popped in a nude pop I really wanted
while we're having powder my hands I
just want something neutral I don't want
to take away from the awesome I like we
have going on this is one of my favorite
just like nude blushes and for highlight
I'm going in with one of my favorite
highlighters this is the shadow illusion
from Urban Decay this was in the palette
The Wizard of Oz Glinda the Good Witch
palette so I'm sorry you cannot get it
but I suggest just using any like almost
like shitty eyeshadow that you told
using on your lid that's shimmery on
your face
and on your face it looks so good it
looks like nice and natural I give such
a beautiful Sheen and when you use these
ones that don't have too much Sparkle or
really glimmer
it just gives such a nice natural or
more natural highlight which is
something that I really like so that's
what I suggest I know I'm sorry I'm
someone who uses discontinued and
limited edition products because that's
what I have I try to use stuff up but
you know a lot of my stuff is older and
getting discontinued and not available
anymore and I'm still wanting to use
those products up so I'm gonna be using
this on my inner corner as well I might
go in with something a little more
intense but I might not need something I
don't know we'll see how I feel I know
where he left off I took a quick little
break I got a really sweet message on
Instagram from a new subscriber and I
don't know I if you really really want
to contact me instagrams the best way I
feel like that's where I don't really I
feel like okay you take the time to like
jerk message me I gotta like get in here
you slid into my Dion's and I'm not
gonna let you go so anyway um I have I
have all my stuff on I think we're
moving on to the under eye area of my
eye so I'm gonna go into the kiss shadow
again and the brush we used to put on
the lid and I'm going to keep this
mostly on the outer portion of the eye
at the moment I don't know how smoky I
want this to get underneath the eye like
I think it could look really cool really
smoke gel but I also just love the way
it looks already and I don't want to
mess it up I like the way that looks I'm
gonna go in with a little bit of that
deeper shade though trying to find a
brush I'm gonna go in with a little bit
of going steady and just keep that
really tight to the lash line and the
outer portion of the eye and connect it
to that upper lip I think that's it I
don't think I'm gonna bring it too far
in I'm gonna instead go back in with my
highlighter and really bring that color
down a little bit more to really
brighten this area and mix it in with
whatever pink might be there for
eyeliner today I'm going to be going in
with a white on my lower lash line
that's just going to make sure my eyes
look wide and awake
not sickly sometimes pinks and reds can
kind of look a little sickly which I
couldn't like that look but if you
really don't want to definitely use this
this just gives me like wider eyes to
because I do have very like almond
shaped eyes and then the other liner I'm
going to use is just when I'm trying to
use up from Urban Decay it's just a
purple and i'm going to tightline with
that and might run a little bit on the
lower lash line on the outer corner just
to kind of again deepen that up and then
i will be back lasting for eyes i'm
gonna go in with mascara I've been
really liking the Urban Decay perversion
this is one of my favorite high-end
mascaras I love that it just gives
really nice separation and fluffiness to
the lashes I do have to build it up for
a second but it's really nice I really
like it I am so in love with this look I
think it looks so so good I feel like
I'm looking somewhat washed out and I
don't know if it's the camera so I'm
like scared to add any more like blush
but I think I'm gonna act just a little
bit more I'm gonna turn his build up
this blush just so I have some color to
my cheeks maybe this in nude wasn't the
best choice I don't know I also don't
want to like look crazy because it's
just the monitor or something and really
it looks fine and then I like patola
there's some beeping going on but last
for today's looks our lips so I'm going
to go in with this color pop lippie
pencil in Aquarius I'm gonna line my
lips and fill them in okay cool I'm
liking it I'm liking it next I'm going
to go in with this Kevin a Quan molten
lip color in the color cyber opal and
it's a really pretty pink and I'm just
gonna put a little bit of that on and
kind of blend it out it's not really
showing up on camera but in real life
like pink reflex to it and it's really
really beautiful so I thought if we're
gonna go pink let's just do it I don't
know it's all away
avi avi I'm going to take a look I think
I need a little bit more on the lower
lash line what do you guys think it just
isn't quite enough we need more so I'm
gonna go in with the color savage and
really bump up that lower lash line
something I like to do is sometimes it's
nice to like put your lower lash mascara
on add your eyeliner and what not so you
can really get an idea of how in
that lower lashline is and then you can
go back in after you have that and add
it so you don't go too overboard all
right guys that's everything for this
get ready with me I hope you enjoyed I
know a lot of you guys said you'd like
to get ready with me is not necessarily
just a tutorial so I'm gonna keep doing
that and that's everything I'll stop
rambling thank you so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
