Lauren good morning I am actually
filming in the morning today I thought I
would do another get ready with me you
guys know I only been enjoying doing
these and today is going to be a little
bit different because I am going to be
kind of recreating a look I'm inspired
by something I saw on Instagram let me
pull it up for you guys that is a look
I'm trying to recreate today I'm just
gonna do something similar - it doesn't
have to be exact but I cannot say the
artist name so I will be fairly down
below with her Instagram so you can
check her out but I just kind of like
that I was I've had my phone on this
like little table thing like seven
hundred times well first thing today I'm
going to be using my wife el primer to
prime my face and also just you guys
know I've never really filmed this early
so I don't know what the sound situation
is going to be like so today we'll find
out so I hope you guys had a good
weekend I'm filming this on Monday and
are probably going to post it on Monday
as well so it's like in a real time me
and Sam we're pretty just doing like
basic stuff the second he was off Friday
- so that was kind of nice we got a
three-day weekend we did a lot of post
dating I like to debated talking to you
guys about that just because I don't
know I just felt like weird that we do
that sometimes but I also really enjoy
doing it so I'm just like why do I feel
weird plus if any of you guys post me I
don't want I don't think you should feel
worried about it so I thought Yui
so other night we post me did a ton this
weekend just to get some extra money
some thing you guys don't know I guess
this is like my official announcement
even though does it matter you guys
don't care we are planning a trip to
Italy next summer I'm super excited
about it I'm using my bye bye redness
little packet sample to use this up I've
actually been enjoying this but I just
wish it came in different colors I just
things a little bit of that over I think
it's really thinning consistency and
that's what I think I like about it the
most anyway we're going to Italy next
summer in June and I'm really excited
about it it's something we've been
wanting to do for a little bit but the
fact that we're actually planning it is
just like a miracle I feel like we're
going with Sam's family and then my
was coming as well and yeah it should be
a good time Sam is like kind of the
person planning everything for everyone
if you guys don't know Sam is one of
seven children and almost everyone is
going on the trip so it's a lot of
people and things to coordinate and I
know it's a lot of work for him so I
don't know how he's doing that but he is
and I'm very happy about it but that
should be such a fun time I'm really
excited I can't wait to login and show
pictures once we go oh my gosh we
haven't been out of the country since we
went to Peru which was long it feels
like a long time ago feels like forever
ago that mostly covered everything when
it comes to my redness but just because
I'm going to be using the easy way
moisture mat and just the tiniest amount
of this I'm not trying to go too crazy I
realized just right now that I was
planning on doing my eyes first but I
guess not so what we're doing in Italy
let me continue to talk about that we're
going to start off and fly into Rome and
that will be really fun this will be my
second time in Italy in Rome me and him
took a trip there my after my senior
year of high school we saved up a ton of
money and we went and traveled for a
month and that was really really fun so
I'm excited to go back Italy is probably
my favorite part of that trip I think
because it has like the lowest
expectations I almost didn't want to go
I know that sounds really weird we did
so many things on that trip so we flew
into Scotland we went to Ireland and
then we did England France and then the
last part was Italy until he went back
to Scotland to stay a little bit and
then fly out from there so I was just so
excited for like France you know and all
these other places that I feel like I
let Italy kind of just whatever like
okay cool about Italy but it was really
my favorite time in Rome was so much fun
I have really good memories of Rome it's
just so beautiful I loved it so I'm so
excited to be going back and being able
to see more we weren't able to see the
Vatican we weren't able to see a lot of
things so I'm so stoked to do all of
that I'm going to wait to do the rest of
my
until I get my eyebrows we'll do some of
my eye makeup that way I can cover stuff
with concealer if I need to I'm going to
prime my eyelids this is my Maybelline
master prime we don't have like a full
fledged schedule yet of like what we're
doing every single day we just know
where we're going to be for the most
part those days unless they want to take
like a day trip so after a room we're
going to go down to the Amalfi Coast
which I'm really excited about we never
have done that and that should be really
fun we're going to be there most of our
trip like a good five night savings and
we had to rent like a really big place
because there's so many people it's so
much work like when I think about the
fact that all these people are going to
meet up somewhere else around the world
kind of crazy especially because we all
don't live in the same place now so yeah
it's kind of a lot to curtain same for
brows real fast I'm just going to do
these I'm using my ELF brow pencil and
my color pop pencil this will be an
outer half this will be in the front
half my eyebrows just like literally two
seconds to do and I just use the elf
pencil just you guys know being like it
was like super fast today so hello there
even and it's not just an illusion that
it was a good bra day let's move on to
eyes I have to put a hold on what I'm
talking about because we've got some
stuff to do I have a few different
palettes I'm going to be working out of
to create this look so first off I'm
going to take my color pop yes please
tell it and I'm just taking the shadow I
believe it's full zip it's just a cream
color and I'm setting my entire lid the
first thing I'm going to do is go into
my self culture palette and I'm going to
be taking the shade dawn and I'm going
to be running that into the crease I
don't have thoughts on this palette yet
I just I haven't been using it honestly
enough to really tell you guys how I
feel in a really strong way so I'm just
using this because I'm still testing it
out and I feel like that adorned color
is going to be really pretty to put in
the inner portion of the lid so that's
why I'm using this today you can use
whatever you have the similar I feel
like dogs are really similar color if
you want to know dupes for this I have a
whole dupes video I will leave a link
down below I want to show you
I have been getting at what it does it
says scam like they may like that
hello and then no one ever answers and
I'm not someone that's going to sit
there and be like hello hello hello and
then finally the recording goes off so
so so irritating so I'm just building up
that first base color and then I'm going
to go in with something a lot more
orange to really get that warm crease
color I'm going back into the ex-police
palette I'm going to take the color this
one here which is big cocktails I
believe and I'm just going to be putting
this on top of that color and just
making it even more orange and that's so
annoying now with those scan people I
don't know how I got on so many
scandalous it's really been I feel like
recently like the last six months which
I don't understand I also feel like my
brother put me on something I don't know
what I'm pretty sure it's him I don't
know why I blame them but I'm pretty
sure him last night before is going to
bed I was looking at some of my older
videos because I was trying to do
research and Disney prepare today when I
was going to film cuz I am doing a
Polish pics update and I just wanted to
kind of know like what was my
inspiration from the beginning kind of
like what's going on with this project
because it's it's kind of like all a
project over the year and it's not like
monthly updates
I just wasn't super fresh on it and then
I got on this whole thing looking at a
bunch of my old videos and my goodness
that was weird
alright I think the orange base looks
pretty good now I'm going to go in with
a darker color for the inner and outer
portion halo the eye I'm just gonna be
using this Ecotools to do that and I'm
going to be going in back with this
palette I know I'm going to be using a
mix of I feel like that's too deep at
first okay
I'm not using such from this palette
because I honestly don't think it blends
that well and I don't want to totally
eff up this look so I'm going to be
mixing a little bit of little boat and
sea stars to put into my inner and outer
portion of my eye and then I'm going to
go in and deepen it up even more I don't
notice or not
oh yeah old videos of mine oh my gosh it
is so insane to go back and
videos that are old I can't even tell
you how weird it is and it's really
strange
because I don't know I even talk
different in my first couple of videos
I'm like so much more like kind of like
hey guys like I'm talking at this voice
okay guys it's like creepy and weird to
me I don't know what that's about but
it's interesting to to see my energy
levels and just different things
sometimes I'm like why do people
subscribe to me I sound so bored even
though I'm not I mean I think I still
sound kind of bored but that's just the
way I talk so leave me alone but anyway
I just thought it was really interesting
and I was looking at all my makeup and I
was like damn girl here my couple of
goods on these videos like the lighting
isn't very good but used to wear a lot
more because we feel like then I have
been recently and it's kind of inspired
me to I'm just like go back to wearing a
bit more makeup like it looks really
good in videos it's fun so I don't know
that's part of also what inspired this I
love oh I have hiccups oh my gosh I feel
like I get hiccups all the time it's
like if I eat you also get hiccups if I
don't eat I get hiccups I can't win
alright I like the way this looking I'm
just going to go in and blend while
we're in between going back to the
orange and here I'm probably going to
mix it with a little bit of this other
color which is similar to Dawn and I'm
just making sure that the edges are more
blended I am going to deepen the inner
and outer corner a little bit more so
I'm taking this color in the palette but
anyway oh yeah
so when I was looking at my old videos
it was crazy because they really thought
like oh I do the same look but I really
have two different looks going on I mean
I usually apply my eyeshadow in the same
way but the actual looks were quite
different so it's weird how I think of
myself and then and I go back and look
at it and like the reality is so
different it's really weird
I think that looks pretty good let's
just move on to the next step and we can
always perfect those areas I'm going to
be laying down a base for this is my
Clarins I pencil this is the waterproof
eye pencil in the color copper now this
is a little bit more orangie than the
bronze color that we're going to put but
I feel like the entire look is a little
bit warmer so I'm hoping it'll just be a
nice base and we'll kind of get it to
look of the picture and I'm just like
roughly sketching that on I'm kind of
tapping out with my finger but I'm okay
if it's a little roughly blended we are
now going into adorned from the palette
I have not used this shade yet so and a
little nervous and I'm just going to set
that in the center of the eye and we'll
blend out oh yeah see this is not nearly
as orange ha I don't know if it's going
to work I'm going in with my finger and
just having adorn on the eye something
that's happening right now I feel like
my eyelids getting a little I don't want
to take scaly but it's there just looks
like a lot of product is on it so I'm
not the biggest fan of that I don't know
if it's like because of the eyeliner or
if it's because of the shadow because
the shadow is quite oily hopefully the
look okay on camera or maybe it's just
because of the mixture of the two I'm
not sure not exactly loving it but we're
going to move on I'm going to go back
into this darker shade and kind of
deepen at that outer corner in our
corner and blend it into a dorm so far
it really had very minimal fallout I'm
going to go into electric now this might
be the most fatal mistake but I'm just
going to try to put a little bit of this
over
adawn and try to get a little bit of a
lighter look from it I don't know I
don't know what I'm doing at this point
in the picture it kind of looks like
golden II when it's the light so I
thought that electric since it's not do
crow would maybe be cool no I don't I
don't shake it so I've barely had any
fallout which is awesome I'm going to go
in and just sweep that off I really hope
this looks ok on camera because like in
person I'm not loving my eyelids
hopefully with everything else it'll go
so I'm just going to finish up the eye
so we can do the lower lashes for liners
I'm going to be using my white liner on
my inner waterline and then for the
tight line I'm using Mac's Costa reach
eyeliner just the nice warm brow I don't
know what she's doing for liner but I'm
going to go with my classic and liner
look because I don't want to cover up
all the beautiful work we have on the
for the lower lashline we're kind of
just mimicking what we did on the top so
I'm going to go into dawn first and run
this underneath and this one I'm taking
kind of the entire length of my eye I
guess I should do concealer before it is
what I'm doing I'm crazy as you can tell
I don't normally do my makeup this way
so okay let's finish concealer and today
I'm using my Maybelline master conceal
I'm almost done at this I'm so freaking
close I can't wait
so anyways back to the trip so we're
doing me I'm off Ito's and I'm really
excited about that we're saying bye
Santorini because that's in Greece
it's a Sorrento we were planning a trip
to Greece first so it's kind of like
hopefully we'll do a couple day trips to
I do want to bauble in there and you
know I mean that's it's so far off in
the future so it's kind of like a lot to
talk about and we don't have everything
set in stone we're going to even have
our flight yet we're still waiting on
like a good ticket price and all of that
but I thought it would just kind of let
you all know what is other what we're
planning let me know too if you've ever
if you've been to Italy or the places
that I mentioning and what you think we
should do if you have any suggestions
that'd be so amazing I'd love to hear
them we all can do or on I'm going to go
in with my kiss Pro touch powder oh my
gosh I have concealer everywhere I just
use this aside under my eyes and in my
cheekbone just because it's so
lightweight it doesn't add a ton of
texture or anything but it sets that
area so it won't move around as much I'm
not sure how I like my foundation
combination today either for the rest of
my things I'm going in with my Revlon
nearly naked and I'm going to be putting
this wherever I didn't use the other
powders oh my gosh another thing man Sam
did this weekend
we watched Silent Hill now okay I have
gone on this weird kick of watching
these weird documentaries on YouTube so
I was watching this one called the real
Silent Hill and I had never watched that
on hell I'm not a gamer so I never plays
a game like I don't really know much
about it but the documentary is about
this town called tent Elia I don't know
it's something like center but not
anyway and they had a fire going and so
that is like basically the only thing
that sound
is based off of off of this town like
nothing else is similar because it's a
made-up creepy horror story we're doing
bronzer going in with my Milani I'm
going to finish this guys I'm going to
do it I'm so pumped about this so anyway
so I watching that documentary and then
not got me on like I want to watch
Silent Hill I've never seen it let's
watch it so we rented it yesterday it
was pretty creepy but it's also it's
like based off of the game so I feel
like if you played the games you
probably get it a lot more and like
really liked it whereas to me I'm like
trying to watch a movie not a game so I
think that'd be really I really like the
story of it I like more like
psychological things like that so it
would be cool if they redid that movie I
really think they should redo it with
better CGI now that you know if not 2009
or 2004 whatever that thing came out I'm
not a Whore person I only love for stuff
I don't like watching it I don't like
doing makeup for that really but it
sounds kind of cool I mostly just like
specific like I have a connection to it
because I watch that documentary and
then I wanted to watch it that's kind of
what I need I need like some connection
to things to want to try it if it's out
of my norm for blush I'm keeping it warm
toned I'm going in with my Sephora
Pantone universe this is my makeup
basket I'm glad you guys were enjoying
the makeup basket so I will continue to
do those I'm just using the middle shade
here I know it looks like nothing but on
the cheeks it does show up I did not
bring a highlighter out here so I'm just
going to use the one in this palette as
well I do like this one so it works out
and now we can finish the eye so I'm
going back into dawn from the subculture
palette and I'm going to continue to run
that underneath the eyes like we were
doing I feel like my get ready with
knees are always kind of like all over
the place but I like doing tutorials
more like this I'll try to do some more
like actual tutorials I'm thinking about
doing like an inspired series where I
you know just do looks that I'm inspired
by whether it's like a picture like
today on Instagram like someone else's
actual makeup or if it's just like a
picture of colors and just wanting to
combine those colors and maybe like
inspire
by the shapes of that or whatnot I'm not
sure but I was thinking about maybe
doing that I just again I'm still
working on quality and I want it to be
good I don't want like put of tutorials
that just are shitty so I mean you look
back at my channel I've already done it
but I'm trying to not do that anymore
what am I looking for
okay I'm going back in with the orange
from my color pop palette and just kind
of smoking this out and combining it
with the upper lashline I feel like you
could definitely use so culture to
create this entire look and then last
I'm going to go in with the darkest
shade from this palette and I'm going to
be putting those closest to the lash
line just to define the eyes a little
bit more I was wanting to do pink brows
today but I think it's just a little too
much maybe with this eye look I am going
to deepen up the outer portion though so
I actually will end up going in with
this color pop for a pencil I just feel
like I need a little bit more structure
and intensity to go with this eye look
and then to set my grandma's place I'm
using this black clear brow gel because
I thought everything put pink in my
brows I got a clear brow gel would be
best so I wasn't like putting color on
top of that but since we're not we're
still using it anyway last for the eyes
I'm going in with a mascara this is the
Kiko Milano summer 2.0 mascara I have
used this one time look at this wand
what it's so tiny and I really like the
wand
I think this formula I'm still
questioning because I put this on and I
did get some flakes so I'm going to be
testing it out again today and seeing if
that is still true but I do like being
able to get to the very base of your
lashes it's such a small wand like this
it is definitely interesting I've always
wanted to try mascara like this but I
never have until now I hope it was just
a weird day or I like rubbed my eye and
didn't realize it or something because
there were like little black flakes
everywhere when I use this so hopefully
that doesn't happen again
Sara my mascara on before I move on
though I am going to go into the tie
lighter and just highlight this inner
portion and then last is lips I'm using
right Jordana lip liner in tawny and I'm
going to line and fill in my lips
this and now that I have that gun I'm
going to go in with just a gloss this
one is from Egon and it is the color
Josephine these have like that rose
scent but there is no denying that this
color is beautiful
alright guys that's the final look I
think I did a pretty good job I think
it's pretty similar to this what do you
guys think let me know down below let me
know if you like these or if you want to
see more like tutorial and you don't
want the chatty part I don't know what
to think my quality is fine enough to do
it it's what you guys want you know I
just don't want to put up something that
just kind of like you know anyway that's
everything guys thank you so so much for
watching and I will see you in the next
video and that's everything okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
