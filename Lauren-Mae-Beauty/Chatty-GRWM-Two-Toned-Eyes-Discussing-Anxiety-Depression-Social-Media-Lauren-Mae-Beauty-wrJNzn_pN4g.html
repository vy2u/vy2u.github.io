Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me I just want to do something
chill and we're gonna be using the Zulu
palette oh no did I break this I dropped
it right before this but we're all good
I'm using the Zulu palette from juvie s
place because I really haven't used it
honestly if I'm being honest I want to
do something different though I'm gonna
do one I want color and one eye a
different color this is something I've
seen a lot unlike Kat Von D's Beauty
Instagram I feel like the one I see the
most is either like a blue and a yellow
I know I've seen that and then I've also
seen like a blue and a pink but I'm not
gonna be bad adventurous today you guys
know my pre film and I'm filming a
couple videos tonight and I just don't
want to look crazy in all of them so I'm
gonna be doing one eye orange and one
eye pink and see how that goes I know
I'm comfortable in those colors and yeah
I know I'm not gonna be used to seeing
my eyes two separate colors so hopefully
this will be like a little introduction
and then maybe we can go a little bit
more adventurous like purple yellow
that'd be cool cuz they're you know
contrasting colors anyway that's kind of
the deal this is just gonna be a talking
video so I'm not gonna really zoom us in
or anything like crazy because yeah
we're just gonna be talking chatting and
I'm taking you along so first off I'm
gonna be taking and here I go telling
you exactly what I'm doing I think I'm
gonna go on with the yellow on both eyes
just to lay down a bit of a base I don't
know I kind of wanted this to be just
like one color very like monochromatic
but can't we go I don't know what I'm
doing um okay hi guys how are you I hope
you're doing well I'm filming at night
I'm very comfortable today if you can't
tell of my outfit I'm chilling out and I
would like to say like oh I'm just
chilled today but like let's be real if
I get the chance I am in like chill
clothes all the time like sweats I love
them so yeah but anyway I just wanted to
be chilled tonight I couldn't film this
morning because we had people doing work
in our bathroom cuz like our ceiling was
like caving in on us you know normal
stuff and so I didn't want to like waste
the day though so I thought I would just
do something kind of fun an experiment
tonight do I get ready film some videos
we're gonna just go in I'm going on with
the orange well I guess this will be the
orange eye and then we're gonna put
orange underneath in pink and pink it's
gonna look cool I have a feeling whoa
that's pretty pigmented so that's just
kind of my morning and you know what I
realized we're just getting straight
into stuff um if you guys don't know I
deal with a lot of like anxiety and I
feel like I'm dealing with also
depression at the moment and this is
something that I touched on really
briefly in my flashback favourites video
at the end I know that my channel and a
lot of people's channels are a place you
come to like you know have a fun time
and have some entertainment but I also
want to keep it real with you so I'm
trying to find that balance I'm just
using that there side of the brush
because I am the painters were supposed
to be here today at like 9:00 or 10:00
but they came early and they came in
like 8:30 and I thought for sure they
were gonna be a little bit late but they
came early at 8:30 and the guy was like
no I told you eight and I was like no
you didn't he told me nine or ten and I
just had anxiety about them coming the
whole time
and I know I wasn't working or anything
that day today so I was like what am I
gonna do I'm gonna be home and the whole
time they're here I don't really know so
anyway they came early but it like threw
off my whole day and I realized like how
anxious I get because Sam's like so they
came a half an hour early and I'm like
when he puts it in perspective like that
I'm like I guess you're right it is only
half an hour but it felt like such a big
deal to me we're getting already a
little crazy I'm gonna take this up
pretty high I guess I did not set my lid
today so that maybe it was a mistake but
these are like crazy pigmented anyway I
just realized how much anxiety I have
and I feel like I've been letting
anxiety control my life for the last
little bit like with just different
things and like how I'm moving about my
day and different things so I really
want to try to work on that and just I
don't know if sometimes I feel like
talking about it helps so that's what
I'm kind of
with this I'm telling you guys but I'm
not trying to like it like I'm fine you
know it's just if you deal with
depression I feel like I'm
high-functioning so it's like I get
things done you guys see me post every
day but like the rest of my life I feel
like it's just difficult it's difficult
sometimes and every day is different so
if you're struggling I feel you I think
I want to try to like I've talked about
that where it's like I want to go get
and see a professional
I just haven't looked into that because
I even have anxiety about that like just
making appointments you guys now
comments all these like weird things I
make it myself sound like a crazy
paranoid person but I'm just telling you
the truth how cool is this already
really love this look I'm just blending
out these outer edges and I'm bringing
it a little bit into the brow not like
have time but that's just like the
preferred I shape that I have on me you
know I think it's I'm interesting I've
told Sam this and I think maybe I've
mentioned it I have so many videos I
don't even know what I mentioned in half
the time I feel like so many youtubers
say that they have anxiety and all this
stuff and I don't know if it's just that
a lot of people have anxiety nowadays or
wrong color or if it's just that a
certain type of people like gravitate to
online posting and like vlogging and
stuff I feel like there might be
something to that anyway we'll stop
talking about that because I'm it's like
a downer subject but I thought I would
just tell you guys some insights I had
today the fact that that just threw me
off so much and it's like wasn't that
big of a deal and then I just like I
feel like kind of used it as an excuse
for my whole day being messed up not
like an excuse like on purpose but you
know what I mean like I realized that oh
it's not that big of a deal it shouldn't
have like thrown off everything but it
did so ok anyway I really love the way
this is looking
I think we're just gonna go in with
Foundation and I really have like no
fallout
I was scared I wanted oh we didn't so um
for face I'm gonna just prime obviously
I did my eyebrows first because I just
didn't want to deal with them on my face
today I'm using my Cokie primer this I
have in a project pan currently and I
just
try to use it up and actually get some
good progress on it so I'm gonna be
trying to use it and resisting the urge
to use so many of my other primers
because I have so many going on right
now like so many little deluxe sized
samples I'm so excited to try I've been
really into just radiant healthy natural
skin lately you guys know that and this
one's a nice primer though I feel like
it definitely is good I just you know
new is always fun another thing I kind
of wanted to talk about so you guys know
I'm going to Italy this summer I'm so
excited I feel like I'm like thinking
about my life in a countdown to Italy
because it's gonna be so fun okay but
something insanely weird and like crazy
and cool and I'm so excited but like
this is my husband he's a psychopath he
calls me up and he's already at work
because he worked super early in the
morning he's already at work and he is
like hey Ian McClellan I think that's
his name I don't know it's the dude
that's like Gandalf
I believe I'm pretty sure is that like
the white wizard I don't know the big
guy with the long beard in Lord of the
Rings um he is performing King Lear in a
play
I think it's King Lear yeah in a play in
England and he's like and tickets just
went on sale not only 25 pounds and I
really want them I'm like okay so he's
like I looked up tickets to England and
they're only 500 for a roundtrip and I
was like okay I'm like still sleeping
like trying to wake up like what's
happening I thought like this was an
emergency
um and so he's like I really want to do
that so he bought those tickets and now
we're going to England in October which
is so crazy I was not expecting that to
happen this year I was totally just
happy with Italy but now I'm like oh my
gosh so we're going for our anniversary
it'll be our 11 year anniversary in
October so I'm really excited
about that and it's just like this crazy
weird thing I feel like this year me and
Sam are just like taking no hostages and
just living our dreams me on something I
feel like we think a lot is like leap
and that will appear
that's what we say um and that's what
we're doing this year we're leaping and
we're just hoping there's a net man
we're making life happen and not slowing
down for anyone who else is obsessed
with the slip already kind of would just
let you guys know that it's so funny
because I was like mom I have really
exciting news and I guess I'm at the age
where she just assumes like you're
pregnant like no no no not pregnant just
going on another trip but that kind of
segues into the fact that I'm thinking
about starting Instagram stories I don't
know you guys know I try to have balance
when it comes to social media because I
think so easily it can just like take
over your friggin life and like so
easily things that are online can seem
like these big deals and then it's like
no one and your personalized life even
knows what's going on and like you know
I love social media I think it's so cool
and I think that it's awesome that you
can have a career and do all these
awesome things because of it
but there's so many negatives to social
media too like with weird like FOMO and
weird like you know thinking everyone is
like doing this awesome stuff when like
really everyone sitting at home with
their animals like binge watching
Netflix like literally everyone's
actually doing that but it looks like
you know everyone's having an amazing
time anyway kind of going off on a
tangent there but I only have right now
Instagram and YouTube as like social
media things I don't have a Twitter
honestly I don't even want to know what
I would like randomly tweet out in asper
and heat of the moment like I don't even
want to deal with myself doing that I'm
not even that type of I'm not even that
type of person honestly like I had
Facebook and I would I would like go to
write something and then be like why
does anyone care what I have to say so I
would just delete anything I was maybe
going to type I'm Way more of like I
like talking to
Kameron talking to you guys like this
way and I like Instagram because it's
like visual but when it comes to just
like my words I'm just like okay like
Who am I you know but I was thinking
about Instagram stories would be like a
fun way to document like fun things I'm
doing like fun on set a certain day I
definitely don't think I'd be doing it
all the time cuz like you guys don't
care if I'm just like sitting at home
doing nothing like you just watch
Westworld cuz that's what I'm doing
currently and I'm obsessed was world I
don't know why it took me so long but
seriously Sam barely gets any sleep but
I'm like I don't care like just stay up
enough so that you can start the episode
and like you can fall asleep but at
least like I don't have to feel guilty
that I'm watching it without you
technically like you're the one who fell
asleep for all over setting powder I'm
using my Becca one this one has really
been liking it has a bit of a sheen to
it and that's what I've been loving it's
pink so I have to just be careful about
not using too much but it kind of forces
me to be light handed with it which I
like anyway I thought it'd be a fun way
to document different things I'm doing
without necessarily like posting a
picture that goes forever on your
Instagram like obviously you can delete
stuff but you know what I mean like you
don't necessarily want a random ugly
picture on your Instagram just to like
show people you're doing stuff whereas
you can have a story and it's much more
interactive let me know if you guys
would be interested in that I don't know
I don't know I I'm literally the person
on set where they're like here take a
snapchat of me and I'm like how do you
do that you hold this down like I'm a
little graham on set with that I wanted
to ask you guys if you wanted at all
like a Q&amp;amp;A or anything I've never really
done a Q&amp;amp;A I kind of have done one once
but the thing is it's like I never
wanted to really do one cuz it's like if
you guys don't care like that's awkward
when there just don't get any questions
so if you guys want a Q&amp;amp;A maybe leave
some questions here I might mention it a
couple times like if people say yes here
I'll mention it in the next couple of
videos and then do one once I collect
some questions I don't know I used to
tell myself I would do one at like
50,000 subscribers and we're there so I
now let me know if you don't I'm not
offended totally get it but if you do
leave a question down below or let me
know you want one by leaving questions
below I'm using a new product today this
is the bare minerals well-rested I
talked about this in my wish list and I
just did it I thought it so it came with
the reason I got this the sample that I
got with it was the coverfx glitter
drops because I would never purchase
those ever no but I would try them out
for free as a free little sample so I
got those to try out and yeah no one
needs more than that amount you'll never
go through more than that amount so I'm
using this under my eyes to brighten I'm
nervous it's gonna be too dark or yellow
or something but we're just gonna try it
I just wanted something like after I did
stuff I could just kind of like run
under my eyes
okay right in that area don't know if
this is a good fresh to really be
applying it I definitely think it
brightened in person it's a little bit
yellow I feel like on camera it's not
looking quite as yellow I think it
definitely brightened what do you guys
think we move on to bronzer today I'm
using the number 7 one and I'm gonna be
using the Sigma brush yeah
I'm gonna be using the Sigma f20 brush
and we're gonna pray I don't put too
much on did I have something else I
wanted to talk about I feel like I did I
can't remember oh yeah something I
wanted to talk about was I just wanted
to say like congrats to Lucia and also
Paige from the birthday Beauty Lucia Liz
Lucia Temper Beauty I think pretty sure
they both have had like really big
spikes in their channel as of lately and
I just want to say like I'm so happy for
them and I think it's great if you guys
don't know who I'm talking about I'm
gonna leave links so you can go check
them out but I just think it's so cool
to see some people get some awesome
recognition for some videos that they've
done and creative ideas and you know
it's it's such an insane rush when you
have just so many people randomly
watching your channel you don't know why
you don't know why that video why that
yeah it reminds me of like Legally
Blonde when I say that so I totally know
what it's like cuz that's literally the
story of my channel and so I just think
it's cool tapping to other people and
people in the community who are you know
into just being a little bit more
conscious and I just think it's cool
that other people are finding them and
you know I hope that this will give
other channels like hope to that it's
like again you just never know what
video is gonna hit it so just keep being
creative keep just putting the best you
and content out there that you can and
just hope for the best and just don't
get discouraged you just seriously never
know what's gonna hit and what's going
to be popular I'm looking a little I
don't know how I feel I feel like the
center of my face is super white and
then the outside is orange but yeah I
just it's just so amazing to see it
makes me just so happy for this
community and the beauty community and
just everyone like that people are
finding content that they enjoy outside
of just really really large channels and
I think that that's so great there's
nothing necessarily wrong with large
channels I know I talk about a lot of
stuff but you know I think it's great
and I think a lot of people work really
hard to get where they are but I think
sometimes it just seems like this
impossible mountain like YouTube is this
impossible mountain to climb and it's
it's not necessarily it still is insane
and you know the chances are very slim
but that doesn't mean they're impossible
and I don't think that means you should
stop doing it and not do it because you
should if you want to do it and you
think you'd be good at it I'm the type
of person that's like go for your dreams
baby do you be smart be teachable try to
just better yourself and you know don't
be closed off to any not necessarily
criticism from the comment section or
criticism from other online sources but
just in general like be able to look at
yourself and you know see where maybe
you could make an improvement or maybe
this would be better or whatever you
know without being harsh on yourself but
just you know wanting to always be
better I just thought that was super
exciting I wanted to
I'm using a light pink blush today we'll
see if it even does anything oh yeah I
didn't want anything to really take away
from the look but I wanted it pretty
warm or warmer I feel like that
under-eye powder really like that's me
it it's like so bright under my knees
guys what's happening I'm gonna try to
buff some of that away I just feel like
it looks a little crazy town
I think I just used a little too much
we're gonna work on the brushes let's
move
oh no no let's let's highlight what am i
doing
Who am I I feel like I've been waiting
to highlighter lately like I just I love
the highlight which you guys know it's
not really me this one has just been so
good I never thought I'd like it as much
it's the Becca Flash's champagne Bellini
I thought this would work well because
it has that like pink and gold orange
flash and wear pink and orange today I
feel like my forehead bronzer is a
little psycho I remember when I talked
about like natural glowy skin that's not
what this is that is not what this is
one you're a liar
feeling crazy talking to myself I'm
gonna put some white liner on my lower
lash line just to kind of hopefully not
look like I'm sick and dying all these
colors tend to make people look tired or
like disease and again sometimes I'm
into that look but tonight I think we
need more help than that so I'm going to
be going in oh my gosh okay this is
where we switch it up this is the mega
so Jeb so I'm taking the pink I'm
putting it on the orange side and I'm
gonna buff it kind of a lot I'm super
happy with these shadows and how they
perform so far obviously I'm gonna use
them more so I can give you guys more in
depth of actual review I really want to
do this in the saharan palette together
I think I'm going to do obviously my
review video and then coupled with that
I think I'm gonna do two different looks
with each palette I don't know
let me know if you want to see that all
in one video like more condensed and
shortened or if you'd want like this and
palate to looks and then this to looks
in separate videos I can do whatever you
guys want I just don't want anything to
ever be too like long for you guys and
we're going pretty heavy just so we can
actually see it I don't want to Q settle
you know this look isn't exactly subtle
you know what I didn't bring out here I
did not bring the lip color I just I
never think about lips it's like the one
thing I'm looking for a brush that I
can't that's okay we're going to just
we're gonna rub this brush on my hand
and just try to get as much color off
did you know that this is if your omona
color switch just kidding
but yeah and that looks good and now
we're gonna go in with the orange on the
pink side I think this is so cool it's
kind of like it just adds some like
lines and you're a joker but without the
lines it's just kind of this like I'm so
cool I don't need rules I'm gonna also
pack a little bit more of the pink on to
the lid because I feel like it's not I
was like bright as it could be so cool
alright I'm loving it I'm like I'm
saying tonight I'm sorry I'm going to be
just putting lashes on like mascara and
then we'll do the inner corner now let's
just do the inner perimeter for the
inner corner and going in with the shade
cosmic which is a moon dust shadow from
Urban Decay so I'm going to be using a
glitter glue this is the one from NYX
I'm going to be putting that on my eye
on the inner corner and I like to bring
it down into on the lower lashline a
little bit and I'm gonna use a separate
brush to apply this glitter well oh yeah
look at that I had this in my flashback
favourites and was like you know what I
should use that so that's what I'm doing
everything else is matte so I thought
it'd be kind of nice to add a little
shimmer a little glimmer I've never used
that glitter glue before I feel like I
should have maybe blended it a little
better I don't know
a little like start but it's fine it's
fine I'm gonna put some mascara on and
go find a lip color to put on with this
look and then I'll be right back
hello guys I'm back I tried to remedy
like the bronzer situation I don't know
I just feel like it looks a little weird
now I feel like my forehead looks pale
and weird I did decide on a lip product
this is tight fit from colour-pop I have
such a love-hate relationship with this
I think it's so pretty
but it also does some weird stuff on our
lips but I thought it would look cool
with this okay well I think this was
kind of a fast get ready with me I don't
know I hope I touched on everything I
wanted to I can't really remember I hope
you guys enjoyed the look I think it
looks really really cool
I love how blue my eyes look it's just
something a little bit different and
kind of fun so let me know if you would
try this like would you wear two
separate eyes because now that I see
this I definitely think I would
potentially especially this color
combination I think I would do this and
go out like that he looks cool alright
guys that is everything thank you so so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
