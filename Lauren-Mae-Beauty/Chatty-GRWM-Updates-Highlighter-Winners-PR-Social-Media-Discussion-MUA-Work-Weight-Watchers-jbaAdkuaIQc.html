Lorne thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a to check
get ready with me it feels like I
haven't done one of these in a really
long time and I just wanted to sit down
and talk to you guys catch you up I kind
of use these as a community bulletin
board kind of like the community to have
on YouTube but I like make a whole video
yeah so I'm just gonna be getting ready
I'm gonna mention some products as I go
but if I don't
everything will be listed down below in
the description box I do have quite a
few new products to test out and so I
thought this would be a fun time to do
that while talking to you guys I think
one of the biggest things I'm trying out
is this brush set from Coastal Suns they
set this over to me and I guess it's
like really secretive like it's now
available on the website today so I have
a link it's not affiliated I think this
is only like 14 dollars today I've been
using the brush set and I think it's
really nice I just think it's hilarious
that they're like making it it's like
it's a new launch like oh my gosh you
can now the links available like they're
really like pushing hard for this but
I'm just like it's a fresh set it's nice
it's affordable okay cool anyway I'll be
using those brushes today I just wanted
to let you know since it is 30% off for
the next three days just in case you
wanted to get it either way though it
literally does not affect me let's get
into this get ready with me I'm really
sorry for any jock perks but I am going
to be prepping my skin with the Kiko
this is the under eye balm and I've been
using this basically I was like an eye
primer lately so how have you guys been
I hope you've been well I want to say
thank you so much to everyone who left
really sweet comments on my coconut
video I know that one's like kind of a
weird series but I've just had so many
amazing scents around me and I just
thought you know what I really want to
do this so I want to do it and so many
of you guys love coconut too and even
those of you who didn't who are like I'm
still watching the video so thank you I
do appreciate all the kind words on that
since it was kind of a different video
for me for a primer today I'm gonna be
mixing two different ones this is the
Clarins SOS and this is the Ofra cool as
a cucumber I'm gonna put this one on
first this one's more of like a
moisturizer and the other one is a just
a tiny bit more silicone II so I feel
like it fills in pores a little better
plus I've really been
the more glowy skin and I'm using the
new shameless foundation from Marc
Jacobs because I was sent that through
Influenster so that's kind of cool I
feel like I haven't gotten a Vox box in
a while so it was kind of a cool one to
get although everyone freaking hates
that foundation so hopefully it's good
it kind of you know had me more
intrigued honestly because I want to
know I don't know I feel like everyone's
style is to kind of like build it up to
full coverage and you know I want to see
what some like long-term wear on it is
like it could be just as crappy as
everyone saying it could be just a myth
foundation and it could be good so if
you want to see a review after I've
tested that let me know and I can do
that for you guys so there's a few
things I wanted to get caught up on one
we have the results for the highlighters
that you guys voted for me to buy from
that video I also want to say thank you
for all that like support on that though
it's like a cool just like fun
interactive video and I for sure next
time we'll be doing a fricking Pole
because my god I tallied up over 2,000
different freaking votes so yeah it took
a really long time before we get into
the results I'm gonna be using again the
Marc Jacobs shameless they gave me they
sent me the shade one ten fair which I
believe is the lightest shade and I
think it might be a little too light so
I happen to have a sample of 210 yeah
210 so I might be mixing these to get my
shade just so you guys know cuz I think
this is gonna be way too light oh it
looks really yellow too okay and I'm
gonna be blending that in with my Beauty
Blender just because I want more of a
sheer coverage I don't know I just want
to try it with my Beauty Blender so for
the results color pops flexitarian won
it was the number one with 404 votes
number two was an Oprah highlighter at
369 votes and then to base is a third
winner with 271 votes I'm not gonna lie
I feel like Amber easy and the laura
mercier one were really close like
second runner ups they both had like two
hundred and fifty two hundred and thirty
and I was tempted to go top five but
then I just know my I know myself that's
one of my problem he says I'm just like
me and Sam when we get together oh my
gosh it's like instead of buying tickets
to
one thing will be like well let's just
get season passes why not like we just
think of things like in bulk value but
overall that's not always good so I am
just going to be testing out the three I
might get two shades from the colour-pop
one instead of just LexA Tyrion just to
see what a different ones like and I
might get two of the Ophir ones as well
just because I want to try out the
glazed donuts I think that's the like
really white one but I also want to try
out pillow talk so I think those two
based off of your guys's comments are
the ones that are gonna fit my skintone
best and then obviously just the
two-faced ones so I'm really excited
flexitarian has been freaking out of
stock and of course that is while
colour-pop is having their 20% off sale
on their site but as soon as that comes
back into stock I will be purchasing
those and I don't know how I'm gonna
format the video yet so I don't know if
I'm just gonna do like a review but I do
want to show you guys it on the skin so
I might do like showing my first
impressions of all of them and then come
back with the review just so you guys
can see it on the skin and everything
let me know what you guys think if you
have a better idea I'd love to hear it
that's the highlighter which I
definitely didn't add enough of to
tennen because this is way too light for
me but I am going to be using a cream
bronzer today so that will help at least
some so far I can tell you though me I
don't know man
I think all the reviews might be right
we'll see maybe I'll just have to play
around with different primers but it's a
little patchy and it just kind of looks
a little dry I don't know it looks so
pretty on the hand on the face I don't
know another thing that I wanted to talk
about in this video was PR and I wanted
pure that's what I always think of every
time I say PR too fast cuz I feel like I
talk so fast but when I say PR it just
sounds like pure so anyway I've been
getting a lot of PR lately and so it
makes me want to like one kind of
potentially make a new tube talk about
PR and affiliate links although I do
have an older one and I went back and
watched it and I feel like most of my
opinions are like it's like I'm the same
person actually in that one like my
opinions haven't changed although I do
mention like watched on cookie ins
channel and I
definitely don't suggest that anymore so
maybe I should just delete that link I
don't know but let me know if you'd like
to see me do like a new and like kind of
revamped one about PR I also want to
talk about kind of like the
behind-the-scenes aspect like the things
you guys don't know and maybe like it
could help some creators as well because
obviously every like company and every
transaction isn't gonna end up the same
way but there's I feel like some
different things behind the scenes that
I didn't realize so but if you want a
video on that let me know it might be
like super overdone at this point I
don't know I just have been thinking
about it it's been on my mind a lot
because of other videos as well as
because I have I've been very very lucky
to be reached out to you by a lot of
brands and that's something I'll say
like I don't reach out to brands to send
me PR I I just don't like I think the
only couple of things that I've done I
did sign up for the pixie and got
rejected at one point and then I signed
up for the derma e and they did accept
me and I did get one box but I feel like
those are kind of like really easy
programs that they have set up you like
literally link your YouTube and then
they reject you or accept you but for
like other brands where you have to like
email or do I don't even know I I don't
know because I don't do it but I'm just
saying all of the brands that have
reached out to me that I have gotten PR
besides that one derma e box have all
been they reached out to me and so it's
been really exciting especially because
it has been super huge brands I've got
some stuff from covergirl Moroccan oil
freaking sol de janeiro and so i've been
toying with the idea of doing like a PR
haul type of video which I can already
hear some of you guys groaning no but
let me know what you guys think about
that
I mean it's ultimately obviously my
choice and it's not meant to brag but I
really do like showing you guys what's
coming into my collection and kind of
reading you guys and knowing what you
want videos on I don't get insane
amounts of PR but you know it's
definitely the most it's ever been in my
whole YouTube career so if that's
something you're interested in or not
you know delicately leave your response
down below that'd be awesome I'm leaning
toward it though so yeah I think I might
do something like that like a new and
Beauty PR haul or something like that
maybe even doing them kind of like every
two months or
I don't know as I have stuff just to
show you guys and then you guys can let
me know yes we want reviews no we don't
care about that and I can kind of you
know see what is going to work well for
you guys as well as the things that I'm
personally interested and kind of
present those ideas in that video as
well I do not know I feel like this
foundation is very very odd it just
comes off so easy so that's just a
little PR stuff just to let you guys
know a little bit about what's going on
in my life I did a music video shoot
like a couple not this last weekend but
the weekend before that and that was
really fun it kind of went haywire it
had some technical difficulties you
could say it was for a Swedish artist
actually he lives in Sweden and his
name's Boris and we got along so well I
freaking love him we just like connected
so much he's just like a chill dude and
like his whole crew was really awesome
and it kind of just reminded me of like
who I love meeting on set you know what
I mean like sometimes you can just find
some people you really vibe with and
that was just a good time you know and I
did vlog it so as soon as the videos are
like done and edited I will like do the
vlog and then link the video so you guys
can check it out I think it's kind of
like a fun way to show you guys my work
but also you know a little bit of
promotion for them I don't mind doing
that I think it's fun and I love I
really do love showing you guys what
I've worked on when it comes to that
uber commercial honestly guys I don't
know I have absolutely no idea what's
going on with that I probably should
email Julia and figure that out but
thank you guys all for watching it thank
you so much for going and watching the
other like kind of like re commercial
that I linked so many of you guys went
over I really appreciate it it's super
cool to share with you guys some of the
work I do besides obviously all my
YouTube videos and you know I think it's
cool too because it is something so if
the actor bullet isn't just glam makeup
it is you know like a movie and sweat
and dirt and just different things you
know that you don't necessarily see me
apply on my channel so so I have the
foundation bronzer on I'm just going to
be setting with powder I'm gonna be
mixing the two that I usually use one is
my Maybelline
powder and then the other one is the
Becca one so I'm just gonna be setting
my entire face Oh another cool thing
that I'm doing in April I'm gonna be
going to organ I'm super excited Amy who
is who directed the unnatural film that
I worked on like a year ago at this
point I think it might even be like in
may two years she got into the Ashland
Film Festival and she invited me to go
with her so we are going up to Portland
uh sorry there were like a million dog
barking but so anyway I'm going to be
flying up to Portland in April and we're
gonna be up there for like four nights I
think four nights five days it's gonna
be really fun
it's just like us two and it'll be a
cool trip if you guys haven't been here
since the beginning if you want to see
the trailer I'll try to link the trailer
for unnatural in the description if you
want to check that out it was a short
film I worked on the topic is a bit
controversial but I really enjoyed that
movie I connected with a lot of cool
people on that set and yeah I'm really
proud of that project it went to like a
film festival in France like I'm really
proud of that project so I also did a
thesis that is going to be at the
Phoenix Film Festival so if you live in
Phoenix and you want to go check it out
that's my hometown baby a short film I
worked on called stray is going to be
there it got accepted so that's really
awesome - I love drew the director
Stephanie the producer of that one so
I'll leave the trailer for that and yeah
if you happen to live in Phoenix and you
want to check it out go see it I think
it's in April as well when that one
happens I think Sam might actually go
and I think my mom is gonna go too but I
think I will be out of town at the other
festival but that's really cool I mean
that's like not normal you know I'm just
going cuz we're friends not necessarily
just because I'm the makeup artist or
anything I really hope you guys enjoy to
me sharing my work I just think it's
kind of a cool element to my channel to
be able to share those experiences and
moments with you so I really hope you
enjoy that as well of course though like
do not feel obligated to go look it's
just if you you want to see you know
what actually I'm working on outside of
YouTube I forgot to mention but the
brush I was using for bronzer this is my
favorite brush from that set honestly
for the price I think this brush alone
is worth
I just love it so much I love a tapered
brush like this you guys know that but I
just I really this is my favorite brush
from that set 100% for short I just
think it's so nice it works so well it's
so soft it is a little bit light like it
doesn't have the the weight to it for
like fanciness but I really enjoyed this
brush anyway I'm trying out a new blush
today this is from Oprah oh it's super
powdery and this is their shade Bellini
yeah this is the blush and Bellini I
feel like I put it solo what that
happened I was just thinking about
actually right now guys something about
the P are going back to that is a PR I
want you to know that like with my
channel I honestly don't think I haven't
used a fan brush in forever I don't look
at my channel I was like a way to sell
to you guys like at least not at this
point like my job is not at all to sell
ever like ever and I think that's why I
don't like getting like coupon codes or
discount codes or being affiliated with
a specific brand to necessarily like my
magic links are affiliated but they're
just any brand I can link anything you
know it's not like I'm trying to sell
you on this blush over this blush like I
can put whatever blush I actually like
down there anyway where I'm going with
that is that like I know sometimes it's
like it's their job to sell but it's
like that is not what my mission
statement on my channel is that it's not
what my channel is about or what I'm
about I like to give you guys
information give you recommendations
give you guys reviews and opinions and
like fun videos and thoughtful videos so
you guys can make your own decisions and
do what you want to with your own money
but I don't ever want to be a
salesperson I worked sales I worked a
beauty job doing sales I've done retail
like all of my normal job besides being
a makeup artist and doing YouTube like I
do now and it's not my favorite thing I
don't personally like pushing products
on people I like you know giving people
information helping them out and giving
suggestions if that's what they want but
I don't want to be invested and if you
buy a product or not honestly and that's
why I'm ok with PR because I
that I'm gonna give you an honest
opinion so you can make your decision on
whether you want to buy it or you don't
or whatever the case may be and that's
it you know what I mean
so anyway that was just something I just
like randomly thought of for highlighter
I was using the G or and I really like
it this has been like my favorite
highlighter lately I really love it I'm
gonna be doing eyebrows I'm gonna do
them on camera just so you guys can see
them so hopefully I don't mess them up
I'm gonna bring my mirror in just a
little bit closer though I think that's
all I had to talk about work stuff I
literally made a list so that I could
talk to you guys about all the things
that I want to cuz I know myself and
I'll freakin forget everything this is
the colour-pop brow pencil in the shade
blonde no yeah blonde mm-hmm yeah just
blonde this is my favorite for doing the
front portion of my brow so they don't
get too dark and crazy and I always have
to fill this side in more because
there's just not enough hair in the
front on this one it's so crazy I mean
it's not that crazy but you know it's
irritating more than anything I had a
few people ask for me to do a brow
routine so I will try to get that I mean
I have been trying to do more tutorials
lately I have a boxycharm one coming up
with the palette that will be in the
next couple of days I have it all edited
out I just didn't film an intro for it
so yeah I'm gonna film an intro in this
look just so you guys know what's up and
then I can edit that together but I have
really been trying to do more tutorials
on my channel you know I'm just kind of
like making sure that my content is I
feel like nice and balanced you know
like I want to do fun videos about
gimmicky products and I want to do tube
talks and I want to do tutorials and I
want to do reviews like I want to do a
mixture of stuff I want to do some
project pan stuff if I'm feeling up for
it so yeah I hope you guys have been
enjoying the tutorials and I will be
doing a brow tutorial if you want that I
mean I feel like I'm pretty simple
honestly I used the same products for
the most part I have like a good I don't
know couple of products that I'm most
likely using on my brows like every time
I honestly just try not to fuss too much
I feel like all the times when I care
too much about my brows they always turn
out the worst and when I don't
 they look so good so just a few
more life updates
I started Weight Watchers with my mom
she was gonna do it and literally I'm on
like today's day two so it's like it's
not a big deal
I haven't like lost any weight I don't
have results I don't have any of that
but she was gonna do it and then she
just asked me point-blank I was like
well do you want to do it with me and I
was about to restart keto because I had
friends in town and I just had gotten
away from it and I was gonna start it
that next day so I was like you know I
didn't even think about it I was just
like you know what yeah let's do it you
know what I mean one of my downfalls is
that I just think about it too much like
I want everything to be perfect like
okay I'll make sure I have all the
groceries in the house and I'll do this
and I'll do that and I'll do this and
then it's like by that time you're so
exhausted or you know peared is so far
gone from the thing it's like it's not
that's something hard just it's simple
just do it so we signed up and yeah if
you guys are doing Weight Watchers you
know you can add me if you want to I
don't I doubt I'll be doing any real
posting or anything on there but I
thought I would just let you guys know
in case you are on it or whatever if you
have any like pointers or tips that
would be cool so for the point system I
mean I don't have any issues because I'm
used to doing keto although it's way
different for points a little bit
because I can't have like cheese or
really anything like the point system
it's like a freestyle anyway it's like a
whole thing I won't get too far into
that in case you like literally don't
give two shits about it which I can
totally respect but I am excited I am
excited to you know lose some weight
it's kind of fun that we're doing it
together and it's motivating to do it
together so that's the kind of like
YouTube content I've been watching
lately and going off of that one of the
things I'm really trying to focus on
right now is I really want to be focused
in my life I feel like lately I have
been letting social media just kind of
like take over my life and you guys know
I feel like I'm just kind of like I can
get overwhelmed kind of easy because of
my anxiety and everything but you know I
just I don't know I think I'm gonna like
cut back a little bit I really haven't
been posting on Instagram much I'm still
gonna daily upload that's not
think about I'm just talking about like
I feel like I'm always clued in like I'm
always watching content or looking at my
comments or looking at something or
seeing all my subscribers or how's this
video doing or Oh what's this comment
saying and like I or I'm thinking of new
video ideas or filming my ideas or
editing my ideas like I just feel like
my life is so much social media and not
enough grounded in the real world right
now which is all me
so that's something I really wanted to
focus on I watched a video and it was a
little bit ago from our know Elaine if
you guys don't watch her channel she's
really awesome I'm gonna leave her link
down below she's super sweet she always
comments on my videos she's so nice and
she did a social media detox and so she
basically did it for a month and she I'm
just setting my lid with translucent
powder but she did it for a month and
she you know just kind of came back I'm
gonna leave the video link and talked
about what she kind of experienced in
that time and you know what it was like
she basically deleted Twitter and
Instagram and Facebook off of her phone
and yeah I'm kind of feeling inspired by
that honestly um you know I just she was
saying how she realized how much time
she spends on her phone and that is so
me I hate it I hate it so much and I
wasn't always like that but I just find
myself I'm just I'm always like you know
multitasking like doing something and
somehow looking at my phone watching the
show and looking at my phone like I
don't want to do that anymore I don't I
want to be as productive as possible and
I know that so much of my time is being
sucked away to looking up random things
or you know just constantly being
connected I forgot to let you guys know
I'm using my BH Cosmetics zodiac palette
today I just went in with the shade here
which is under Aquarius I think I'm
gonna do something with the actual
Aquarius shade it's like a duochrome I
haven't touched that one yet and I think
it'd be fun so for me I think what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to still upload
like I love uploading I love getting my
ideas out there I love I love creating
content but I think I'm gonna kind of
step back from watching as much content
and reading my comments constantly
throughout the day
stet I think I'm gonna do more of like a
batch style situation where it's like I
spend maybe two different parts of the
day looking at comments or something or
you know checking my social media in any
way and just see how that works out I
just want to see how much more
productive I can be I know that there
are so many more things in my day I can
be doing when I'm not working on set or
whatever even when I am on set I'll be
on my phone sometimes which that makes
more sense because you know it can get
boring between takes and all that but
for my everyday life I just know there's
so much more I could be doing and
there's so much more potential I could
be tapping into but I feel like I'm just
squandering my time and I could be doing
exactly what I have done and get the
same information do the same thing in
like a fraction of the time and I just
think it'll be nice to not be so plugged
in you know I think that one of the
things that I value in myself and want
to continuously keep on my channel is I
don't want ever for social media to I
don't want it to work me you know what I
mean like I just think it's so easily
can work people and that's not something
that I want to do so I like to try to
keep myself as grounded in the real
world as I possibly can and so I think
that's something that I've just noticed
I've I've just had more of a habit with
I just I can see it forming into
something bigger it's not like horrible
right now but it's just something that I
know so much of my time so much of my
time could go to better things I'm gonna
go in with this shade here so yeah I
don't know how many of you guys can
relate to that but I think just scroll I
mean I find myself I'll just be
scrolling through Instagram or you know
just always trying to find something to
do and I don't want to do that but there
are so many things I could be doing in
my house besides freaking looking at
post Malone's Instagram you know which
Sam net post Malone last weekend what
the Freak
oh I was so jealous we went out with
friends and we were walking to a bar and
there was the Seth Rogen party for some
Netflix thing he's doing and soon was
like oh I think I'm gonna just go into
that no way we're all like you can't get
in he's like yeah I can so he just
walked in and went to the freakin party
was there and he met him and got a
picture with him so I'm so jealous you
have freaking absolutely no idea I love
those alone so much I love his music I
think he's like a dope dude and yeah so
I think a me so sad no I'm really happy
for him but I was like at least it
wasn't Drake if it was Drake I literally
would break up with him no but I would
be so jealous you have no idea but
anyway I always like to try to keep it
as real as possible with you guys and
that's just something I've been feeling
and something that I just realized like
I feel like so much of my life is just
in like chaos and I think it's because I
just don't focus my attention the way I
need to and for the shade I'm gonna put
him down the kalindra clip from NYX
oh my lid I think there's just so much
more I could get done in my day and I
know you guys see me uploading every
single day which you probably think like
you do so much but it's like I just know
there's more I can do and that's the
type of person I am I'm like obsessed
with Hamilton still and I'm just like I
feel you Hamilton I just feel like I i
I'll never be satisfied ever in my life
that's the type of human I am that's a
type of human Sam is but I really do
want to try to optimize my day so that I
can fit as much as I possibly can in and
then when I have gigs because that's the
kind of work makeup you know makeup is I
don't always have a gig it's not that's
just not how it is y'all which is
perfect because then I can do YouTube
all the times that it you know isn't but
I want I want more than just you know
social media and that is something I'm
gonna focus on I'm not doing like a
full-on
detox I'm not doing any of that
necessarily but I do want to try to like
focus in and and not be so just yeah I
think just like tuned in is such a good
word for it I just don't always tuned in
I know what's going on I watched so many
people's videos and that's great I love
supporting people but I want to just do
more here at the house and you know
focus on other things as well and I'm
really excited to be focusing on my
health and I think that that will take
some energy and I think with everything
when my health is more in order I think
my mental health will be more in order
like just so much is gonna fall more in
line and then I can reevaluate then I
think just making sure that I'm
continuing to keep good habits with
social media instead of reverting to
anything weird or bad is good because in
this world you can get so caught up in
your own mind as a creator and I always
want to just have the most pure me
content that I can and that's hard to do
if you aren't letting yourself you know
experience things other than social
media if you're living in a vacuum
chamber it's not gonna be good all right
that looks kind of cool right I kind of
brought it up a little high but I think
I'm gonna just add a little bit of this
darker Brown just a little bit to the
outer corner just uh I don't know man oh
no I think it's on the glue but anyway
on to this I look I really enjoy the way
it's looking so far except I think I
might have like effed it all up somehow
with this darker color I think it's like
sticking to the glue a little I don't
know we'll see I'll try to blend it out
but my god this is just so freakin
pigmented which is not always like it's
not a bad thing I just wasn't it wasn't
prepared man I'd love to know from you
guys like whether you're a creator or
not like how do you feel about social
media do you feel like you spend a lot
of time on social media like more than
you wish you had or do you just like
don't have the time to so you don't or
like what I hate would love to know I
think just more as I have been making
YouTube a focus you know it's just
something that I want to check before it
becomes a problem all right I think I'm
gonna leave the blending there hopefully
it looks even feel like I always
something that looks even when we're
filming but then later it looks pretty
decent at least so hopefully that's the
case for this I'm going in with the
second darkest shade that we used under
the eye I know this isn't a tutorial but
it's like when I winged my eyeshadow out
too far that's when things go crazy and
why I continue to do it well know we'll
never know all right so this I looked
turned out way more intense than I
thought it was going to for an inner
corner today I'm gonna go in with the
shade here yeah
it's just the center shade I might wet
my brush a little no I think we're good
my gosh
next I'm gonna be going in with liners
I'm using white onto the waterline the
brown on the tight line and then I'm
gonna put some mascara on and I'll come
back and we'll finish up the lips
alright so I have my mascara on my
liners on I'm going in with the lipstick
tri from this is what's the brand bite
bite Beauty this is kind of a fall look
isn't it
I could literally fuss with my eyes all
day long
I feel like this side looks like
slightly darker are different but anyway
so a few things before we go I wanted to
let you guys know what videos you'll see
coming up so I have my makeup math video
coming soon again like I said the
boxycharm and pure pout that we got I do
have the for looks filmed so that'll be
coming soon I'm gonna be doing a testing
testing one two three on a bunch of
covergirl stuff that I got I got sent to
an insane PR package and I thought it'd
be fun to test out as many things as
possible in that format so that video
will probably be really long and then I
think the other video that I'm gonna
film today is going to be all about
brushes I've had quite a few comments
like in the past and just recently about
brushes so I'm going to do one long
in-depth video today about brushes and
go through every step of your routine
and what brushes I use whether I use it
in my makeup kit for other people or
whether I use it on myself and what my
favorites are I have a lot of like
duplicate brushes but I'm just gonna
show you everything different price
points different whatever and just let
you guys know my thoughts on different
brushes that I have I don't have
anything expensive I'm more of like a
cheap brush person but I think that'll
be a fun video so that will be coming at
some point too I don't know if these are
all gonna be uploaded in what order or
whatnot but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
thank you so much for watching I know
this one is a little chitchat e and we
talked about PR and social media and
like I guess a little bit of heavier
topic so I hope it wasn't too much of
like a burden but more of a nice
chitchat hopefully but anyway thank you
so much for watching guys and I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
