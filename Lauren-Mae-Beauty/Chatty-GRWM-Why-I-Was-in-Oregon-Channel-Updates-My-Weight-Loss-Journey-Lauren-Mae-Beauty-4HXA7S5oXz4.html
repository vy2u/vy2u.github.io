learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me a kind of chit chat update
I like cheese might get ready with me
that's kind of like a bulletin board of
like hey this is what's going on in my
life and you know just an update just so
you guys know there's gonna be probably
noises throughout this video I don't
know ever since I got back from freaking
Oregon it's been like 10 million times
worse than normal so yeah please don't
mind that I'm really sorry I will do my
best to try to like talk around the
noises but uh I don't think it's gonna
stop I don't think said let's just get
into it I'm going in with two different
primers today I'm going in with the
Cokie one that I'm trying to use up and
then also a Becca one I'm trying to use
up I hope you guys are doing well I'm
pretty sure today's video is going to be
up in real time which is super exciting
I love when videos are in real time and
not necessarily like you know two
pre-recorded or anything but I
especially love what get ready with me
are on real time because it just feels
like such a connection you know like I
said this today and it's going up today
instead of like going up tomorrow or the
next day or something so I have a few
things I just wanted to like talk about
so you guys know I feel like I've been
mentioning Morgan like all the time but
I did go to Oregon for about five days I
posted a picture on Instagram like once
I came back because I don't know my goal
I really wanted to take pictures and you
know like kind of be instagrammy about
the trip since I thought it'd be really
pretty and you know a different setting
than I'm normally in but I don't know
that just didn't work out I'm just it's
a great just heart for me social media
in general is like not my forte I went
to that bikes and beauty thing with pur
Lisse and it's so funny because at the
end you know we're all just kind of like
talking and chatting and getting food
and they had like a step-and-repeat
which if you don't know what that is
that's like the thing that says pur
Lisse or you know like at events it's
like on the red carpet it's the backdrop
that's a step and repeat can you tell my
husband's and audio-visual stuff so
anyway I was like getting boom rings of
people and different things they're all
snapping and doing all the stuff I'm
like yeah I'd never done an Instagram
story I promise I'm an influencer for
foundation today I'm going in with two
again I just I'm a mixer guys I love
mixing my foundations I just I like it a
lot so I've been using the
7-1 recently a lot to like mix in with
stuff it just gives my foundation a
little bit more longevity and a little
bit more coverage this is like an
old-time favorite I've really enjoyed
that for a long time but like as I've
been getting into more natural skin that
just on its own it's still really
beautiful it's just not a hundred
percent when I've been liking but anyway
I guess I kind of have lately and then
I'm going in with the Marc Jacobs
shameless I got this in an influenster
voxbox which is kind of cool but that
one's pretty light and also warm tones
so we'll see what this combo does it
might be a little too late for me
actually we'll see we'll see we'll have
to bronze up maybe I'm gonna blend it in
with a different sponge than my Beauty
Blender I Know Who am I this is from
shop miss a and I remember hearing
pretty good things about it and I do
like it it's really good I believe this
is a dollar so they've sent over a
couple things that they randomly just
picked for me so I will probably be
making a video like about their one
dollar makeup and like what's crappy and
what's actually worth it stay tuned for
that I don't know when that'll be
I'll have to definitely test things out
a lot more okay anyway so back to Oregon
instagramming oh yeah
so Oregon was super fun I went with my
friend Amy who I had initially met
because she directed she's a director so
I met her through AFI and I've done like
short films with her in the past and
then I did her thesis and that was
submitted to the festival and got in so
she invited me to go along with her and
let me tell you okay
a IFF is what it is it's the Ashland
independent film festival and so I've
got to goes like I don't know a
filmmaker I got the filmmaker pass and I
didn't have to pay the only thing I paid
for was my ticket and then like some
random food bits but it was like I was
so balling I was like this is the best
this is what it feels like so the place
we stayed out was really awesome in
Ashland it was like a bed-and-breakfast
and our host more from Zimbabwe and they
were so nice and like we got lucky
because in Ashland it's kind of a small
town it's like this like it's like
Topanga Canyon if you live in the valley
or if you live in LA area like it's kind
of like a Topanga Canyon like hippyish
vibes but like also rich there's
definitely money coming from somewhere
so yeah I was like a cool it's a cool
little place I'm using my corrector and
so you there aren't like hotel hotels
there and so you kind of get like lucky
with where you're staying
so we got lucky and we are we stayed at
this really cool place and they did
breakfast every morning which me and Amy
were like yeah cuz we're trying to like
save that money always like we were like
planning our schedule around when we
could get the free food so you know so
they did to course breakfast for us
every day and when I tell you two
courses I mean like it's so nice if I
pictures I'm gonna insert them here it
was such a nice breakfast and yeah that
was amazing it was so amazing that it
was came with it and they were just
really sweet humans and we also met
these like six other ladies that were
staying there the same time as us so
every morning at breakfast we would like
chat and talk with them and they were
really awesome and super cool it was
like a fun time they're all like like a
bit older and like friends and so that
was really fun to like chat with them
and whatnot so it was like such a good
experience that way but just in general
the film festival was so just fun and it
was great meeting other creators and
filmmakers and I I'm pretty sure you
guys know by now but I love watching
films so we saw quite a few films while
we were there we saw on chesil beach we
saw lean on Pete which is like this
movie about it's it's a movie it's like
two movies and one honestly what else
did we see we saw a documentary called
mr. fish and we saw I can't remember we
saw a couple other things but you know
we also got to like meet other
filmmakers at like parties and stuff
and we got drink tickets like it was so
just so nice so anyway that was such a
fun experience and I wanted to try to
vlog it but like guys vlogging is just I
get props to anyone who like actually
blogs because it's hard if you want to
like actually live the moment have a
good time it's hard to do that when
you're constantly like filming all the
things you're doing and if it's a good
vlog you're filming these like little
moments that you don't think about like
the server bringing you the food like
you don't think about like oh let me hey
can you go step back and like then bring
the food let me get this shot like you
know what I mean so anyway it was a
great time and it was kind of fun too
because it was just me and Amy like Sam
wasn't there and it was just like a good
moment for me to like do something on my
own and I really enjoyed it
so plus me and Amy bonded and we're like
we're just such good friends okay anyway
let's set down this make up I feel like
it's a little bit light when I'm looking
at the viewfinder so we'll definitely
have to bronze yeah of course I did not
bring my powder brush so we're gonna
make this work so I wanted to just you
know just kind of debrief you don't
Oregon I know that wasn't like a ton of
information necessarily about it but it
was a really good time and it's been
like a little bit weird coming back
because I I pre filmed all those videos
which I was so proud of oh that's what
we're gonna talk about let's talk about
my neat freaking nasty thumbnails you
guys might be thinking like oh she's
rebranding this is on purpose like no
it's not so I got a new iPhone which I
am so excited about I'm really
appreciative it's like a big moment for
me this is my first iPhone I've always
been Android and so yeah it's a super
great I feel like my life is in
preparation for Italy right now but it
kind of feels like that because there's
a lot that I want to like get done
before we go and one of the things that
I wanted to do was have my iPhone so
that way this powder when it gets into
your mouth it tastes like you just put
sweet you set your face with sweet ammo
which sometimes is like oh wow it's like
cool a little sweet taste but then other
times freaks me out and also really like
brings home the fact that like how much
powder am i breathing in
okay anyway I got the iPhone so that I
could take really awesome pictures while
we're in Italy so you guys know I am
planning I'm like all over the place
welcome to my get ready with me so you
guys know though I am planning to upload
while I'm in Italy I want to at least do
every other day uploads while I'm gone
but I'm gonna try so hard to pre upload
like everything before I leave for 3
weeks so I don't know if it's possible
yesterday I sat down and I brainstormed
over a hundred different ideas for
filming videos so I definitely think it
is and those are all like you know not
necessarily like the same series just
like every category I could possibly do
like I I'm really happy about that
that's like three months worth of
content for me and so I'm like all I
need to do is actually like take the
time to film it so hopefully we can do
that okay so got a new mic on all during
that time I really want to start my
Instagram stories while I'm in Italy
that's my goal anyway I know it's like
weird like I'm debuting it um but yet
honestly that's what I'm probably gonna
do I just want to like be able to feel
connected to you guys and I think
through Instagram stories I'll be able
to do that and like kind of show you
guys what we're doing we'll see we'll
see how that goes so definitely if you
don't follow me on Instagram I'm gonna
start like beefing it up and telling you
guys to follow me so you guys can know
what I'm doing while I'm not actually on
the youtubes even though it will look
like up all the youtubes hopefully
fingers crossed that I can get that much
pre uploaded for bronzer today I'm going
in with something new this is from ciate
London and it's the bronzer in South
Beach when I came back from Oregon I had
quite a few packages and Sam like text
me a picture and was like I want to be a
beauty guru I don't even know how ciate
London got my address like honestly
well creepy guys know I'm very
appreciative so I was like super excited
I'm sure there's a logical explanation
somehow like they're connected to
another brand that I have worked with or
a PR agency I've worked with I don't
know but yeah I came home to this
package full of their stuff and it was
like for Coachella weekend I'm like I'm
not going to Coachella but I'll sure as
heck take this stuff and try it out so
I'm really excited
got one of those blushes that Taylor
from that Taylor raves about so I'm so
excited and we will be using that today
back to all my stories I think I'm like
seven stories in so anyway I'm debuting
I want to like start mainstream stories
I think it'll be a great way to connect
to you while I'm gone even though I
hopefully will have content here on my
channel for sure every other day but I
would like to do daily because I don't
want to have like this missing thing
while I'm gone you know what I mean like
I love filming videos you know and so I
don't want to leave you guys without
content it would just feel weird so
fingers crossed we can get that done I'm
gonna like be an overdrive this whole
next month basically filming two months
worth of videos so we're was like what
was I talking about
thumbnails okay so I got my new iPhone
right and it's great I got it right
before I left for Oregon and you know it
was kind of difficult and weird because
I'm not used to the iPhone operating
system I'm used to I'm used to I'm used
to using androids and so all my apps
before were the Android one and if you
didn't know Android apps and iPhone apps
are like different so even if it's the
same one they might function different
they might look different like they're
they're just a whole different situation
and so what I used to edit my photos on
was pic grid I don't know I've talked
about it in another video before but
that's what I used to use and it's just
not as intuitive as it is on Android so
if you have an Android and you need
thumbnails I feel like that's what I use
and I worked really really nicely but on
the iPhone it's just a lot harder it's
not as easy to use and it was just a
very difficult situation they didn't
have the same font as I used to use on
my all my old videos and so I had a very
like uniform theme going on like I'm not
saying my thumbnails were the best at
all they definitely weren't but they
worked for me they got across my message
they had a little bit of a theme slash
branding to them and they were simple to
make it was like everything I needed and
so with the phone it's like now they
weren't simple to make I couldn't even
keep them the same like for consistency
wise when they looked the same it was
just so difficult and so I was forced to
like find other apps find another way to
make my thumbnails and I think I finally
got into a place where I'm okay with
them like it's definitely different but
at least still be cohesive and I think I
do like them like I think I like them
equally I don't think there were so
that's good but yeah for a while there
it was like scary like what is going on
this girl sorry oh okay I'm using the
shade baby doll this is the blush and
this is like a highlighting type of
blush so I'm gonna just put that on the
cheeks and see it's pretty um like
medium ly pigmented which I love like
that is something I wanted a blush I
love being able to go back dip my brush
in add a little bit more and just kind
of have that control over the color
alright I'm feeling that I'm feeling
this serve the angle is a little bit
different I had to switch out my
batteries for highlighter we're gonna go
in with this rainbow one I'm doing a
pretty neutral look today but we're just
gonna kind of focus our brush in the
peach and yellow shades and hope that
goes well of a new highlighting brush
also from the same and it reminds me of
the honest Osseo one so I'm kind of
excited about that well this is pretty I
thought it was gonna be a little bit
more intense of a color so that's good
oh yeah so with the thumbnails I'm
trying anything out hopefully you guys
don't mind it it's definitely not as
like pink and I feel like the same style
I was going for but I do like it and it
kind of had - it kind of forced me to
have to do something different and get
creative which I don't think I wouldn't
have done otherwise but since it
happened it happened and we're we're
just rolling with it so there's so many
things you just like don't consider when
you like new phone like everything that
you have to do you've to like sign into
all your apps again like oh it's totally
firstworldproblems
obviously it's amazing that I have this
new phone I'm not trying to complain it
was just kind of a lot with everything
trying to like keep everything normal
and then that happening I'm just going
to prime my eyelids we'll do eyebrows
though first and I'll zoom I sense you
guys can like see what's going on so
yeah that is something I'm not
an identity crisis um well I mean I was
but it wasn't like in the same way I
guess that would normally come with that
explanation or that reasoning I don't
know anyway and it's like a new era on
the channel let me zoom in and we'll
keep going for brows today I'm going in
with the color pop in my ELF these are
just like my classic brow staples this
is my empty one let me go get my full
one so speaking of a new era on the
channel I am so glad you guys are loving
the new camera it is so exciting to
finally have autofocus on my camera I
cannot believe it I'm I feel so just
excited and lucky in it it just gives me
the opportunity to film content in such
a different way than I was doing I had a
great camera before don't get me wrong I
just I had to do the focus every single
time and it was hard to do tutorials and
actually being like crispy focus because
you know you are you're moving you're
talking you're doing whatever and I
don't have a cameraman or someone to
constantly make sure and pull focus on
me so it just feels awesome to be able
to give you guys better quality content
it was something I was wanting to do for
a long time and you know I just got
really lucky so I think I'm using the
Canon yeah Canon a DD I got this at
Costco you know I really love it it was
pretty expensive okay like everyone at
Costco was like freaking out when we
bought this they were like oh wow oh my
I'm like okay do you guys not sell these
guys stop freaking me out I already just
made a huge purchase like please don't
make me freak out about it
any more than I already am in my mind
but so far it's been working out really
really well I think you guys can tell
the qualities that are I definitely can
and it's been making filming just a lot
easier and I can focus my energy on
other things besides like Amaya focus at
my unfocused
you know and that's been really nice so
with this camera I realized how crispy
you really are sometimes I'm using a
brow gel this is new to me again from
shot miss a and hope
it looks good but you know I just
realized like seeing myself in such
clear Chris penis it really does make
sometimes you know you feel like oh crap
like oh this looks horrible or oh my
gosh this was so unblended or whatever
you know what I mean and so I've made a
comment like now I understand why people
use filters but just so we're clear I'm
not gonna use a filter I'm just saying I
understand you know if you're already
super well that really darken my brow
but if you're already super insecure
about different things you know on your
face or whatever and then you get into
like crispy mode with your camera you
might actually be looking crispy in a
bad way and not in just like a nice
InFocus way it can just be a little you
know nerve-wracking to upload that to
50,000 people a hundred thousand people
a million people eight million people I
don't know it just gave me a little bit
more perspective on other people and why
they might feel a certain way you know
what I mean but anyway I love it I'm
super happy it took just like a second
to like get used to but now that I'm
used to seeing myself super crispy I
love it I'm just excited that you guys
can see how things actually look on my
skin and the texture on my skin which at
first was like again
scary but uh it's my it's what I've
always look like what I always did look
like battle being said let's get into
the eyes I'm doing something pretty
simple and I'm gonna be using my hooda
Beauty palette so I'm just kind of like
setting my primer cuz it is pretty
sticky just lightly I just wanted
something so I don't have too much of a
attack attacked no attack I think right
at a key base yeah for the transition
today we're going in with the smoky
palette and we're going in with the
light matte Brown here but you can use
obviously anything you have another
thing I wanted to update you guys on
because this is kind of where I've been
updating you guys on my weight loss
journey I've been doing okay I weighed
myself today and I'm the lowest that
I've been since I started which is
amazing I'm down almost eight pounds so
that is a
anything I feel really like just happy
about that I think I technically started
at the beginning of April on Weight
Watchers and so I kind of wish I'd lost
more weight honestly because if you guys
don't know like I know that I don't know
what I look like to you guys on camera I
can only know what I look like in my
brain and I feel like my brain is the
opposite of other people's brains and I
sometimes think of myself as smaller
than I am I don't know what that's about
and then I'll see a picture and be like
well what's going on there regardless of
how you see me
I am very plus-sized not just like a
little overweight I'm definitely you
know overweight and so this is like a
really great thing this is a positive
thing I'm not doing it to just look
better obviously that's a total benefit
but I just want to be healthy I want to
be able to do more things I want to be
able to live longer and my weight isn't
in a spot where it's like oh I'm not a
size two but that's still beautiful like
that's not the weight I'm at and I'm
definitely someone who thinks that like
being healthy is important so that is
why I'm doing with Watchers and I've
been enjoying it since I started
I feel like Oregon was a little bit
difficult because you know we were out
of town but we did so much walking it
really didn't set me back at all so that
was great I'm just yeah I'm feeling
really good I cannot wait to be down ten
pounds that'll feel just so amazing and
I feel like as much as I've like tried
maybe losing weight here or there I
never get to 10 pounds ever even I know
that sounds like kind of pathetic but
honestly I never do I get to like five
and that's really great and then you
know it just kind of like fades away my
enthusiasm for doing it I'm like I just
want to eat what I want to eat so that's
been really great for me it is basically
a lot about food and what I'm eating so
that has been really interesting with
the point system just kind of like
trying to train myself into like what's
a good food to eat and what's not good
and it's been working
obviously I'm down I mean even if I lost
10 pounds in a month I'd be like a
hundred and
20 pounds in a year's worth of months
and that's amazing so it's just yeah
it's a journey every single day and I
think the biggest thing for me is what
I'm trying to do is not let one bad day
one bad decision one bad meal you know
just like get me so off track that I
then gain everything back it's like not
all is lost
you know you just get back on and do
better and make better choices next time
yeah just like a little update I thought
I would let you guys know really happy
with the progress so far I called my mom
we like weigh in together every when we
do it like two times a week just to like
see where each other are at and yeah I'm
feeling feeling really positive today
this Monday has been very good I like
this Monday so I just added like a
darker brown on the outer corner I'm
gonna go in with this models own liquid
middle shadow this is in the color
silver and we're just gonna be putting
this on the inner part of the lid you
guys know so hopefully I don't know it
looks good I never know what these if I
should like cut the crease and make it
like kind of harsh or if I should like
blend out that line or what but I guess
lately I've been going with kind of more
of a harsh crease there and then trying
to blend out with my finger here I think
that's pretty I just kind of like
catches the light and isn't too much
which I like oh wow my doe foots getting
really dirty you got it in my hair now
I'm entirely sure how I like this I
think like once I get my lashes on and
everything it'll look nice but I've been
trying to push myself to do other things
the look I have in my most recent videos
like everyone freaked out about and like
really loves so thank you guys so much
sadly I did not film a tutorial for that
I just was like playing around because I
got some new products which I will be
doing a haul on soon and okay I need to
stop layering it cuz I feel like it's
ruining it but anyway I've just been
trying different like a little bit
different of stuff I've been trying to
use the look what I shot was more I've
been trying to I added that like I don't
know glitter thing I know Elle does that
a lot and I don't know I just have been
trying to do something a little bit
different I love my style and I don't
have her get like I guess kind of boring
for you
so I've been trying to push myself like
when I'm gonna film or show you guys
what I'm doing try to make it different
but the things are all the lovin that I
really appreciate it
let me tell you when I was creating that
look I was definitely scared at first
like is this gonna look good I am Not
sure even while I was doing it I was
like oh my gosh this is hideous like I
cannot film but it worked out it looked
good I'm just gonna go in and deepen up
the outer corner hopefully blend some of
that silver into the brown I don't know
I don't really think that's working I
think this side looks a lot better than
this one so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go in with my finger and some of
these metallic shadows and just over
that kind of threshold blend it in and
tap it out so hopefully we can have a
bit more of a seamless transition we'll
see if that works not sure how much that
actually helped but again hopefully once
we have some liner mascara on I'll kind
of cover it up I don't even know if he's
like look even yea there's just like a
lot of texture going on with the lids
not sure how I feel about that I just
lined my waterline with a white and I'm
doing the tight line with a dark brown
yeah I'm not feeling this shade I will
try to work on application but homies
it's not looking cute
all right blending out some liner on the
lower lash line with my finger before we
go in with some shadow for the lower
lash line I'm just going in with that
light brown we initially used in the
crease I don't want to get too dark and
smoky so that's gonna be the main color
we use and because I can't help myself I
will use a little bit of the dark brown
and just on the very outer corner and
the closest to the lash line and I'm
just making sure that outer corner looks
nice and blended hopefully all right
something I'm gonna do I can't I can't
let the eyeshadow go I'm gonna take some
of the silver on the back of my hand
and just use my finger to Pat out and I
just this one just have so much better
of a blend so I'm hoping I can just kind
of get that going I just see a line of
demarcation there and I really if I
could just get rid of that I can at
least be okay I'm gonna take a flat
brush that I'm just kind of
oh yeah I think that already looks
better right I don't know I think that
looks better right maybe but now I have
that weird brown on my eye like this is
just let's just cover that up with some
mascara I'm using my Urban Decay
perversion today I'm not even sure how I
like that like line I don't know I know
like cut creases are so popular but I
just don't know if I like them on me
like I love other people's eyeshadow
it's just my own I don't necessarily
like like that I definitely got quite a
bit of fallout from that cream shadow on
my cheeks although I was like blending
it back and forth and stuff I want to do
something on my inner corner for the
inner corner highlight I did add a
little bit of the white shadow but I'm
gonna go in with the highlighter and
just kind of soften that hopefully I'm
kind of more focusing it on the yellow
side or straight all right that's the
eye like we got to be done we got to be
done with it for lips we're just doing
something simple this is my Revlon HD
lipstick in the shade dominatrix I
haven't used it in a while I think lost
for this look I'm gonna spray my face
I'm using my Too Faced hangover and I'll
say that this sprayer on the full-size
is way better than it was on the little
one
so that makes me really happy I'm gonna
zoom out and show you guys the final
look not a big deal but yeah I'll show
you that all right guys so here is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
this get ready with me which is kind of
a little chatty a little bit of a
disaster at the end with this eye shadow
but um I hope you guys enjoyed thank you
so much for watching and thanks for all
your support I really appreciate it guys
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
