Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my main top 5 favorite
May was the longest month I it was so
long it felt like an eternity when I was
trying to recount the month and just
like kind of I don't know reflect back
that's what I like to do for my
favorites I couldn't believe that like
this month was the same month that like
second Wives Club aired and I did a
short film and I've also been posting
all these decluttered like I feel like
there's so many different parts of May
it's just crazy
anyway that all being said this is going
to be a bit of a longer video than what
I normally do for a top 5 favorites I
feel like I have a little bit more than
five favorites so yeah sorry about that
but it's just true that's just these are
actual favorite so I'm going to start
with the likes of product favorites at
the beginning here and then I will move
into like extra favorites and random
things I like to mention all different
things not just things that you have to
go out and buy but also just like events
that I was loving and also like shows
and just different things so I feel like
a lot has switched up when it comes to
what my preferences are when it comes to
makeup and skincare so hopefully my
makeup doesn't look too bad in this
video I have been wearing it all day and
um yeah it's a little a little worn and
on top of that too like I am breaking
out under my eyebrow because I plucked
my eyebrows which I never do because as
blonde brows I just I get really lazy
about it
so I actually plucked them and they
always break out it doesn't matter what
I do how clean my face is in my tone and
cleanse afterwards like they will break
out
so yeah that's happening so I feel like
blending out my shadows no matter how
much I blended it out it just looks
patchy because there are little issues
going on up there anyway I'm super
chatty in this video also because I
filmed all my declutter videos and this
is the first like a video I'm filming in
front of a camera so I feel like have a
lot baby grands I've missed you like
face to face back to trying to stay on
track I just had a coughing fit this
foundation has been one of my favorites
I've really been liking a more medium
coverage foundation something that's or
not
overly mad and drawing nothing to
full-coverage nothing cakey and honestly
I feel like the make up for ever ultra
HD foundation is just that perfect
foundation that doesn't look like you
have anything on your skin it perfects
the skin you can build it up if you want
to but it's not meant to be just like
where you're a mannequin you know you
look like a person and I've just been
loving it so I am in the shade 117 or Y
at 225 I'm really wanting to try like
other foundations and just kind of delve
into kind of like easier faster quicker
makeup that is wetting your skin shine
through so that's what I'm really into
if you have any suggestions leave them
below please I really want to try some
glossier products so yeah we'll talk
about that more when I get to skincare
but for foundation I've just been
absolutely loving that if you guys
watched my like foundation routine video
where I go into depth of like what I've
been liking you already knew that was
coming so while with skincare I feel
like my brows are definitely a little
bit different I look back on older
videos and it's very scary now don't get
me wrong style change preferences change
but they're very harsh and I might go
back to that and not realize it or want
to go back to something like that but
it's a little scary also the bad
lighting
I don't think helps anything but I've
really been liking my brow routine
lately so I thought I would mention that
to you guys this is a favorite of life
this is the elf brow pencil in taupe I
love using this I believe there is
unlike the male part of my brows and
like defining the tail and I will go in
with the slightest amount of pressure
and try to fill in the front portion of
my brows but nothing too harsh nothing
shut up
I just don't want to block of a brow I
obviously don't have dark brows to begin
with my brows are blonde if you haven't
seen me without any makeup on yeah
they're just belong so you can't really
see them without me doing something or
defining them in some way so any
definition is obviously going to be more
harsh on me and my fair complexion and
my fair hair so that being said the way
I found to get nice definition and I
really like having like actually looking
like hairs in my
bro are with brow gels this one
specifically has been my favorite this
is from Lancome I got this from octoly
and ever since I got it I've just been
loving it I love the color of this I
love the way the wand is this is what it
looks like it's not like a regular
spleef if you've seen the maybelline new
brow gel it's very similar to that but
shorter and I just prefer this one it's
like a gel formula almost so it's like
pigmented but not crazy opaque I feel
like it has a little bit of translucency
to it which I really like and I really
just like the way to find the inner
portion of my brow and the hairs there
I like making those bands up and then
kind of like you know smoothing on into
the tail this gives hold and definition
and I just I really like the way my
brows look like I'm very into it just
like something a little bit softer so
I've been loving the way I do my breath
see and like even that like I brought it
away but see how it's like it's just not
super opaque and I like that too I feel
like sometimes it's too opaque that can
be really harsh as well yeah anyway I've
been loving the salvation I'm loving my
brows and then it lasts for like
products I want to mention I've been
loving and care I'm sorry I'm a pretty
laid-back person when it comes to
skincare I naturally have pretty nice
skin I went through about of like acne
when I was in like eighth grade freshman
year and then I just went away on its
own like I didn't really have to wash my
face every night like I remember I never
washed my face and I was fine when I
moved to California from Arizona
oh man that's when I started my channel
and if you go back to some of those
videos I mean I had so much acne all
along my jawline and my chin area I
definitely think it was hormonal it was
like cystic it hurt so bad it was like
deep under the skin acne I feel like
that was mostly due to stress but also
could have been from like just moving
here and like the change and like this
being more humid than Arizona which is a
lot more dry I don't know I think
there's a mix of a lot of things but
luckily I've cleared up thank you thank
you seriously and I have you know pretty
good skin I have some hormonal breakouts
when I come to that time in London stuff
but overall I feel
pretty nice and I kind of like take that
for granted like it's nice it's not the
best but I I feel like since I don't
have to do much to maintain it it's oily
but whatever I kind of like my skincare
routine fall to the wayside and I have
really been into just doing a little bit
more being a little more extra but also
not necessarily going extra for price I
am NOT about really high in skincare
like I just want I don't have the money
for it honestly it's like I don't have
100 plus dollars to splash out on
something I don't know if I want to at
least not right now um you know I do I
am getting like fine lines and wrinkles
around my eyes and I definitely want to
like try to stop that but I mean I also
feel like you just age like that's just
life like we're gonna all get old guys
so find someone you actually love anyway
I'm telling you this videos all over the
place I'm so sorry I feel like I feel
like either my videos are all over the
place in like crazy town or like really
like I'm talking to you and like talking
to your soul into the camera I'm like
barely smiling it's one or the other
with me yes anyway I have some products
here that I wanted to mention to you
guys I really don't like spending like
over fifty dollars on a product if I can
get something for like $30 one under
that is like what I'm talking about
I feel like this stuff in here is more
on the affordable ends and obviously
really expensive the first one is
something I actually talked about in a
whole video about pure cosmetics I
picked out a lot of things on octoly to
try from pure and I did like just one
whole video on it in that video I tried
this and it was liking it
but after using it which I've used this
a time and that's all I have left
I have decided that this is one of my
favorite like cleansers and exploiters
and toners I've ever used this is the
pure joy stick exfoliating deep Pore
Cleanser one of the reasons I like this
so much is that it's just filled easy
it's a cleanser it's an exfoliant it
tones I just I like the way this feels
on the skin and I feel like I can just
get all the steps done in one I do use
this in the shower which is where I
mostly do a lot of like my like more
deeper cleanses and this works perfectly
it's so easy I twist it up I just like
rub it all over my face when it's wipe
the exfoliating properties of this
very small and it gives me a nice scrub
without feeling too harsh which I really
like so I could use this every day and
not feel like I'm over exfoliating my
skin I just overall really like this
product I didn't know at first if I
would think it was like kind of gimmicky
cuz it's in like a tube like this or if
it actually would be practical and I
really find that this is super practical
for my life I feel like for men this
would be super practical as well because
it's just easy
I like men's skincare I mean I like
having easier skin here too and I'm not
a guy but I definitely think this would
be something ideal for them because it's
just like it's one thing and they're not
using bar soap so we're excited anyway I
just wanted to mention that I've really
been liking it when it comes to more
moisturizing products I really like the
brand Bioderma as well and really say I
use them in my kit I recently just had
to repurchase stuff for my kids so I
bought some Bioderma eye cream I also
bought some and really say the like
moisture concentrate that's what is in a
kit I really do like that it'll be my
third one that I've gone through what I
love about those brands is that they are
affordable and they actually have good
skincare ingredients and they also are
more for sensitive skin I feel like they
went on so many levels the ones I've
been using personally and really been
enjoying are these two this product ears
from Bioderma this is the Hydra bio
serum and this is part of their
moisturizing lines it's a serum you put
on obviously after you wash your face
and tone it but before you go in with
moisturizer this sinks into the skin so
nicely it feels so soft I love serums
that just sink in and they aren't like
sitting on top of the skin but you can
feel that your skin's more plump and
radiant and I've just really been
enjoying this I went to a bio dermis
demo earlier last week and you know got
a rundown on the line and just different
things which is really awesome and I was
lucky enough to get a few products from
Bioderma which it's so funny because
they literally have just gone to
freaking nannies and friends to buy
replacements from a kit and then I got a
bunch of free stuff because of my
affiliation with Michelle and the shows
and stuff so I will be doing a PR haul
today too but anyway I was looking at to
get this through that and it's supposed
to be from kit but I've been using it
for myself
like it so much and when we were like
testing it when they were teaching us
and stuff I was just like I want that so
I've really been enjoying this how long
can I make the story like that is the
challenge I think and then the eye cream
that I have is from embryo lycée and
this is the smoothing eye contour care
I've really been enjoying this I love
the packaging in this tube I feel like
it says sanitary it's easy to squeeze
out you can see we got more if you feel
more dehydrated or less if you don't
need as much and I just really like this
I believe this ice cream was 35 or under
which is an amazing deal and I've really
just been enjoying it I will say this
does have a bit of a scent on it Sam
does not like the scent use commented on
it a couple of times so I will probably
buy the Bioderma next time for us and we
will use that and see which one we like
because that one doesn't have a smell
but I personally don't mind the smell as
much as him I don't feel like I can
smell it on my like eyes or anything so
I've really been enjoying this it feels
hydrating without being overly like just
heavy
I use it night and day and I've really
been enjoying it and last something I'm
really excited about probably the thing
I'm the most into when it comes to
skincare right now our masks I'm not
talking about sheet masks you guys know
I'm not a fan of sheet masks I feel very
claustrophobic when they're on me I
personally just don't enjoy them I like
like little eye masks those are fun or
the lip masks those are fun but when it
comes to like covering my entire face
it's too much for me I do not know too
much I just feel like I'm suffocating
but regular masks like once you put on
with like a brush and lets it dry and
then take off I forgot how much I
actually liked those I busted this
product out from derma e I got this from
generation Beauty a little thing quite a
while ago and I had never opened it like
I just had it sitting in a drawer I had
two of them at one point I think it's a
cluttered one of them so I just have the
one now which I'm kind of like oh man I
could've actually used that second one
so I hope whoever got that in my family
is enjoying it but this is the purifying
tuned one charcoal mask and this just
was really nice I just felt very happy
with the results I really think this is
comparable to the clam glow clearing mud
the one in the white it doesn't have the
nice smell of glam glow has but this is
one of those clay masks
on let dry and then it does have
particles in it so you're supposed to
like kind of rub it away and wash it
away and scrub your face afterwards with
it this left my skin feeling super
smooth and soft I did have a bit of like
a tingling sensation with this which is
the same thing I have with the flam flow
as well and I just really enjoyed it me
and Sam did it together it was fun I'm
going to do it tonight because I enjoyed
it that much and I am so excited I want
to try a million masks like mud masks
any masks that you can like put on with
a brush like I want to try it I'm so
excited so if you guys have any good
masks that you recommend I kind of am
okay with anything like anti-aging shore
brightening and for like more dewy skin
and glowing skin yeah let's do it
I have oily skin and for like pores yeah
I want to try that too exfoliating yes
like I want to dry all the masks all the
masks so you have good recommendations
please let me know down below I'm really
excited about it and I'm really excited
just hopefully get my skin at a better
place take better care of it and you
know have better skin so I can use less
foundation and I can just feel confident
when I don't have any makeup on my skin
that's it for products I have a few
other things I wanted to mention first
thing for like extra stuff I want to
talk about obsolete I feel like I've
been mentioning obsolete a lot
especially in the last like three months
ever since I started with octoly and
signed up for their site and heard about
it I have just loved their service I'm
sorry if you feel like I'm repeating
myself but if you were a creator I
highly suggest checking it out and
seeing if you can apply and if you meet
the statistics that they require there
are so many different like websites
where you can partner with brands and do
all this stuff and I am telling you
right now there has never been one I've
checked them I've checked almost all of
them out because I think it's really
awesome to get free product to try and
talk about it's like content for your
channel plus I mean who wouldn't love to
like get free stuff and try things out
that's what we're all here we love
beauty products but none of those sites
are nearly as easy to use and I feel
like as transparent as octoly is I just
love that it's a free store you can pick
what you want and apply to try those
items biggest requirements that they
have is that you have to make at least
one
review of the item which is essentially
showing it in a YouTube video and that's
it it could be good or bad they don't
say it has to be positive sometimes
depending on the item a brand can like
contract can be like hey if you're going
to do this we want this to be like a
dedicated video review cos it specifies
you can kind of do what you want with
the product for a video I just really
appreciate the relationships that they
keep and foster between brands and
creators I also really love the new
program that they've instituted which
has been around for like the last three
months two months or so where they
reward creators with like gift cards for
however many reviews they're doing and
all that which i think is really awesome
if you are already signed up for
obsolete just so you know because I did
not know this until more recently
anytime like you're mentioning a product
if you're like mentioning it in
different videos you can submit that as
a review so for a long time I I would
talk about obsolete products in
different videos but I would always
submit it for the original review that I
did for it I'm instead of all the other
times that I just happen to mention it
or whatever it would be I definitely
suggest that like a little I don't know
not hack but you know if you are on the
site you know get your actual reviews in
and have it actually representative of
what you're doing anyway I'm excited
because I do have a little bit of like
money or like op two points that I
earned from last month I'm there and
probably some of this month and I can't
wait to invest those gift cards they are
either for Amazon or Sephora but I can't
wait to invest those gift cards into my
channel and get some new lighting and
get you some different things for my
channel and to invest that back in I
feel like overall it's such a great site
it's a great company I've had know about
experiences with it and I'm just really
into it really happy about I love trying
anything I feel like I have really good
brand so many of those others like
throwing them good brands it's like
brandy never heard in your life and
you're just like hmm I don't know man
I'm a little nervous you know like
whereas these are like Oh Real
Techniques like I love real thanks yeah
I want to try that out or oh by Terry
what like you know anyway I will stop
rambling if you want me to make like an
entire dedicated video that ought to
leave your Creator you want to know
about it or I don't know you just want
to let me know I always want to be as
transparent with you guys as possible
why you guys know what's up but yeah I
really just like it I've just enjoyed it
so much it's so much better than like
grapevine all these other ones those are
really only good if you're like huge and
even then oh no man oh no anyway onto
other favorites another favorite that I
really been enjoying this month and some
of these things are like more towards
the beginning of the month some of these
things are more towards end of the month
but shows I love shameless me and say
we've been watching shameless so much I
don't believe I talked about this in my
last month's favorites if I did forgive
me but we've really been enjoying it
super dark comedy like really dark but
it's really good I really enjoy it and I
was suggest that you can stream that on
Netflix um I've also been super into a
little show called second why school I
learned how if you guys have heard about
it um know if you guys don't know I did
the makeup on second Wives Club I'm one
of the main makeup artists honored um
and yeah it's premiered this month on
the fourth me insane went to the
premiere party after I got Katy ready at
her house and yeah we went to the party
it was super fun and I know I'm super
biased but I've ever actually been
enjoying the show like I genuinely liked
the show I think Katy is so hysterical
she's my girl like that's who I do the
main make up with like that's who like
basically got me to stay on the show was
I came in failed in did a makeup and
then she was like how to make sure
you're on the show how to make sure that
you're gonna do my makeup next week I
just love the show I love all the
different women and just the whole show
it's so good I'm just like babbling at
this point but honestly I really do like
it and I think she's so funny so
down-to-earth so real she comes across
exactly how she does in person I'm just
so happy for her and all the other women
in the show and yeah I love that show
you can watch that on Hulu if you want
to it's on e though so every Thursday
night at 9 p.m.
anyway and the other show I've actually
been enjoying is the Leah Remini
Remini Leah Remini how you say her name
she has like this whole Scientology show
and we've already seen the documentary
going clear that's on HBO if you want to
check that out her show was all about
like Scientology I think they're about
to like deal with it season 2 we watched
like this like our two-hour like special
of her like talking to people if you
didn't know she's like a former
Scientologists and now she's like on
this crusade baby to like Inc the
Scientology from happening I just find
Scientology and we'll just any religion
I got my degree in religion and applied
ethics one of my degrees so I just find
religions in general super interesting
and I really have enjoyed the show it's
heartbreaking to hear people's stories
but it's also very interesting to learn
about if you wanted to you know consume
something about Scientology that is in a
book I think that the show is really
good and I've really been enjoying it
you can watch that one too little oh
that's how we're watching it and last I
wanted to mention a documentary that I
watched on YouTube I don't feel like I
normally watched YouTube documentaries
because a lot of times it's like
zeitgeist type of stuff you know what I
mean and that can be questionable anyway
it's called an open secret and it's
about specifically pedophilia but
pedophilia in Hollywood and kind of digs
into that whole situation I live in LA I
work in the film industry Sam wants to
act I feel very connected to this
subject down only because of that but in
the last film that I worked on was also
dealing with pedophilia I will leave
links to anything I'm talking about if
you want to like dig deeper into like
the documentaries of the shows or like
the film I worked on called the natural
I will leave links for everything if you
want to check it out but anyway it was
kind of this documentary she somehow
requested is not requested it was in my
description box of like recommendations
which is like creepy I know so I was
watching it families out of town and I
was like alone this is like two hours of
my time and it was a very again just
like sad documentary if you have the
time and if you have the stomach and a
heart to watch it I suggested it's kind
of like bad quality in the sense of like
it's not super crispy
like HD crispy equaling HD but I feared
the information in it is very good and I
think that is is hopefully opening a
dialogue that we should be having more
especially in Hollywood but just in life
and just like I just think that this is
a real problem that needs more attention
yeah and I think it's so taboo that we
just don't even like to talk about it as
a problem and we just kind of like let
things go and I don't know how to like
Express I feel about it because it's a
very big heavy huge topic but if you
want to check it out I will leave a link
down below I know it's kind of weird for
some of these like horrible
documentaries and like the Scientology
show in as my favorites but I really do
enjoy the type of stuff and like kind of
being aware of those things
so anyway okay I think I'm onto my last
favorite and that is going to be my
decluttering series I will have my
declaring playlist linked down below
it'll just be those ones I'm going to
make like a new one for 2017 because
honestly I have come so far in my
discerning I did a just clutter series
like kind of right when I started my
channel and I barely let go of anything
I just it takes a lot of practice
I feel like letting go of things and
coming to terms with yourself I've also
been listening to the CONMEBOL credits
because I'm a psychopath and it just
charges me every frickin month patient I
had so many built up and you can't like
stop the service like you can't unsign
up for it without losing your credit so
I just bought like ten books because I
was like okay I'm going to untie that
for it I can sign back up for it after I
read some of these books and one of the
books about with conviron method I'm not
sure how I feel about it if you want me
to do a whole tube top on call Marie let
me know I also want to finish the book
I'm like over halfway done with it
though I really feel like some of the
things I took from the book and what
I've been listening to on top of just
where I am personally really helped me
and I just feel so much lighter letting
go of so much stuff and and yeah it
feels so good I'm really proud of myself
I feel like I made some harder decisions
which our hearts or our decisions that's
why they're called that by on it's so
worth it in the long run I
I'm really happy with it so I think
that's everything guys I think this
video is long enough
I'm really sorry to take up so much of
your time in a favorites video it's not
normally my style but it's all good to
talk it definitely did about the
favorite anyway that's everything guys
