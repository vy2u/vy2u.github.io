Lauren this is going to be just like a
chit chat video not it should check ur
ready with me just literally talking
there were a few things that I've been
thinking lately and just feeling lately
and I thought it would just be nice to
talk to you guys and just let you know
I'm a super honest person and I just
want to be open and honest with you guys
and just talk to you guys I kinda want
to do more videos like this and just
like talking and just my thoughts and
just different things so yeah let's get
into it I kind of have a list just so
that way I have a little bit of an
outline to stay on track um but yeah
let's get into it so first off I think I
just wanted to kind of talk about the
fact that my uploads to me it just it
just feels like I don't upload it takes
forever for me to upload and all this
stuff and I feel like most channels have
time between their videos it's just for
so long I was doing a video like
basically every single day and filming
and editing and all of these things were
such a like and everyday part of my life
and they're not anymore so I feel like I
don't know like I feel like YouTube
taking a backseat I hope you guys don't
feel that way I just kind of wanted to
dress that and just be like i'm still
going and I still like enjoy YouTube
it's just been hard for me to film
lately I don't know what it is I just
every time like I want to film I just
it's just hard to get the energy and
just I don't know what to film so um
trying to work past that there's other
things to just trying in my life to work
past everything's going great and that's
like the thing that's kind of
frustrating is like everything's being
going great everything's been really
positive lately and so it sucks to still
feel like like to feel like this in the
midst of so much great things it's like
I feel like Lauren snap out of it
everything's going great but um I just
feel a little just down or just just
heavy i guess like it takes a lot to
motivate myself I'm trying really hard
I'm trying different tactics to stay
motivated because it's like I recognize
it and I see it and I don't want it to
be that way but it's definitely still a
struggle every single day so I just
wanted like briefly touch on that if you
guys won't talk about that more I guess
we can or whatever I yeah I just wanted
to say that
let you guys know that I'm still
uploading it's just not quite as you
know frequent as it used to be another
kind of big thing I thought I wanted to
talk about is just how i've been feeling
about project panning i love project
panning still I think everyone should
project pan but I think that I'm just
not such a crazy person about it anymore
by crazy person I mean no insult I loved
that I was so into it and I really was
but I just feel like my life has changed
a lot before I had this huge makeup
collection I kept buying things had
definitely an addiction to buying makeup
so I just got overwhelmed with that and
I finally decided to kind of take
control of that and you know not buy as
much use up what I have and really focus
on that and that was great and I'm
really happy with how much i was able to
learn how much i was able to get out I
still love like finishing up products it
still feels really great but I'm to the
point in my collection where one I don't
have as like many little things
cluttering up my collection I really
don't spend money on makeup that much
anymore I feel like I really have
learned what works for me and what
doesn't buy project panning and by
trying to use up stuff that I am so much
better about buying things I actually
like obviously there's a few little
things every now and then but I really
feel like before I would buy every new
palette because it was new because
everyone was talking about it and it
would totally buy into the hype and now
i really only by palettes that I want
that that fit me and um it's weird that
I didn't it's super weird I didn't do
that before but I didn't I just
literally like bought stuff to buy it
because it was a new because was shiny
because the packaging or whatever so um
I just feel like in a lot of ways I'm
like cured obviously I feel like it's
like an everyday thing and it's a
mindset so obviously it can change but
where I'm at right now also taking into
account the fact that i do makeup
artistry know like I'm a makeup artist I
use products on people on set I also do
hair on set to so taking all of those
things into account it's like I'm one
need to buy makeup and and it's fun to
buy new things but it's also i'm not
just used
these things on myself anymore so they
definitely serve a bigger purpose than
just like a personal makeup collection
that's kind of turned into a collection
type of thing I actually use these
products and so to me that is like not
only justification as in like I need
that to purchase but kind of it's like
it's a part of a job you know but I
don't want to feel guilty about buying
stuff for wanting stuff for my clients
or new stuff because as much as I love
trying new things for myself i also like
getting new things for my kit and just
trying different things in that way and
to make my my work look better so um
that's something that's just been like
you know I've just been noticing and
honestly I just I kind of want to buy
more stuff and not in a I want to just
buy everything to buy everything because
I still I have become like especially
when it comes to buying things to myself
like I just don't like spending a lot of
money it's like I don't want to spy that
it's too expensive I don't buy that too
expensive I just we didn't have money
for a while and now that I've been
working a little bit more we have a
little bit more money and I just don't
want to squander it all on makeup like I
used to want to do I feel like with all
that taken into account I really am at a
point where i can kind of by the things
that i want to buy and I feel like
they're all going to be pretty good
purchases with that I just wanted to say
that there might be a little bit more
like halls or just like newer products
on my channel I swear like I have no new
products I haven't tried out any new
products cuz i really don't i don't
really buy them so i just did excited to
do that and I don't want eyes I think
I'm not gonna do project pans I still AM
i'm still super into my finished 13 by
Halloween and just different things i
want to always have at least one project
pan going on I'm just not going to be
constricting what I'm bringing in as
much anymore i think it's like the
biggest thing and it might not have like
as many projects going as at once so i
just wanted to bring that up to you guys
I know that that's like a big part of my
channel and it still is and I don't want
the culture on my channel to change like
even if I'm showing your products I
don't want it to be like oh my gosh you
need this you'll die if you don't have
this or anything like that if I'm
talking about something new it's because
I like it and you guys should decide if
you want it or if you don't want it or
what
I don't want you to ever feel pressured
to like get something just because I
like it I'm just sharing with you my
opinions so even though i'm gonna start
show new products I don't want it to be
like a buy this you need this I still
want it to be like if you think you'd
like this and you were looking into it I
really like it so there's my opinion and
if you want to get it type of thing
anyway I just wanted to bring that up as
well obviously else about whatever else
and I kind of feel like the last no
there's two more things I really wanted
to like hit on in this video one of the
things I wanted to talk about was just
the fact that a lot of companies have
reached out to me i've also been looking
at places like octa lee and just
different things to get sent product and
so because of that i will be having more
products that have been sent to me like
it's not necessarily sponsored but just
like product sent for review type of
things I don't feel like I've had a ton
of that on my channel but I just don't
want that to be weird for you guys I
don't know why I feel like a big thing
on YouTube now it's like it went to
being like awesome to getting product
and now it's more like oh my gosh you're
just bought off by the company cuz they
send you stuff or I feel like I hear
that a lot too I thought this would just
be a really like easy way to be
transparent and that's like my
number-one goal always but I have a
couple things like coming in and stuff
so I want to do videos that you all like
so I'd love to know if you guys would
enjoy like a PR hall I have done that in
the past I personally like that a lot
just because it's like one video where I
haul the stuff you guys know what it's
about from the title before even
clicking on the video and yeah just I
just enjoy that and I I enjoy watching
what people get sent specifically
because I wonder like what's out there
and what what do brands want to like
promote I feel like it's a good way to
like be transparent but also have an
intriguing video the other thing I was
thinking about doing is having just like
really mini reviews i actually got
requested to do these so I I think it
would just be good but just like having
like one two maybe three minute reviews
on stuff probably mostly stuff that sent
to me just because it will just be quick
easy fast whatever but I mean I can also
do it on things that I'm bringing in and
you just want to know like a quick
little like my thoughts on type of thing
so I just want to have like just really
many reviews be as in depth and like as
concise as possible in a short amount of
time
that way it's just not like long and
annoying you know even again with those
products I don't want it to seem like I
just want you to go out and buy
everything I'm just letting you know how
i feel about product so that way you
guys can make informed decisions and
everyone's into different things you
might be we're looking into it or you
might not have been or whatever so
anyway um that's just something I wanted
to bring out and last my last thing
which i never thought i would want to
subscription box again but I kind of
about doing a subscription box again I
just think it sounds kind of fun for the
price it's not too bad and sometimes
little products are really nice actually
for my kit so I haven't decided what box
I want I probably just won't want to
like the ten-dollar ones though just
something a little less expensive but
we'll see i'm gonna look into them I
just thought it would be fun to do that
and then I thought to would be fun to do
like a not just an unboxing but like a
trying them like first impressions
trying them as I'm unboxing them so that
way I could be using the products and
they'd immediately get used and I'd know
if I like them or not at least first
impression wise right away but I thought
that would be kind of fun to go with it
and a way to not make it just like a
collecting and hoarding thing words like
oh I got five new things put him away my
collection cuz I feel like we've all
been there I don't know I just sounded
fun and I just I don't know obviously my
channel and me as a person I'm gonna
grow and change throughout the time i'm
filming cuz it's been years now no it's
been like over a year but um yeah it's
just kind of where I am my thoughts
right now currently I don't want to get
scared that I'm like not gonna do
project panning but I just wanted to
like kind of open up a talk about that
because I've been project panning like
hardcore if you like especially the last
year or so and I think I'm just at a
point right now where I'm just like more
comfortable and can trust myself more to
buy so I still want a project pan and
like focus on things and I still want to
do to clutters and I still want my
collection to be things I love and not
just be huge to be huge but just be
things I like so that's still like the
core of it it's just not so much about
like using up products that I just hate
just use them up and it's not so much
about not buying anything because I have
you know these other foundations I don't
like or what
so anyway I'm gonna end that video there
I thought I would just have a little bit
of a discussion let me know if you like
this type of video if you want me to do
more if there's any topics you want me
to talk about or anything like that I
know I personally enjoy watching these
types of videos so i hope you guys did
too that's everything i will talk to you
in my next one hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
