Lauren this is going to be another one
in my chit chat videos I've done
basically one other one I mean I've had
other ones on my channel but like for
this series i guess i don't i don't
really know what to call it but this
will be like my chit chat number two
this one is going to be talking kind of
about just like my channel over the last
year kind of looking back on it and
looking back just on my life in the last
year I've talked about this before but
I'm someone who puts a lot of pressure
on myself to do everything all at once
go one hundred percent all the time I
have a lot of anxiety and I think that
puts a lot of pressure myself to a
couple weeks ago I was I like looking
over here i'm sorry i'll try to look at
you guys it's just like when i'm
thinking i don't like make eye contact
with the camera for whatever reason but
the last couple weeks probably about a
month or so i was looking back at some
of my old videos and i went through and
i actually wrote down all the videos I
did every single month from the
beginning of the year because I feel
like in the last couple months I really
haven't been posting as many videos as I
normally was and I just felt kind of
doubt about it and like oh I need to
like you know pick it up and do better
for my channel and all these things and
when I went back and I wrote down all
the videos I feel like it's pretty dang
consistent throughout every month I
think the month that i uploaded the
least amount of videos was june or july
and i uploaded like 10 of them which is
still a ton that's still every three
days I'm like Lauren you're crazy and I
realized in that moment that it's me
putting so much pressure me so I put so
much pressure on myself that in turn
makes me kind of work what reality is
and it's like I feel like sometimes I
really will like I'll upload a video and
like seriously within a couple hours I'm
like okay when's my next video I need to
film the video I need to have my video
ready to upload like already in like 10
hours like okay gamma down girl you
crazy that just got me like on this
whole like just train of thought of like
where my channel is going and how much
I've changed I'm looking back at some of
my videos and I mean this year is so
different than I ever would have
expected this year to go I've graduated
school you guys know and
februari and I then just didn't have a
job and I snow I said in a video and I
can't quite find the exact video but I
talked about how like I don't want to do
freelance makeup I want to just get a
job like a corporate job so Sam can act
and I can make money and that's like my
biggest goal and that was like my main
goal and I don't know how but I just
fell into meeting someone who really
like took me in and helped me give me
connections and let me assist her and
then that led to having my own show
which will be airing on e um which I'm
so excited about but that'll be like in
spring which is crazy like I worked on a
show as I mean there were other makeup
artists because when they split
interview days but I'm like kind of the
main make partisans which is like really
cool I just didn't expect my life or
this year to go like that you know and I
never expected me to be working like
freelance and stuff and what I'm looking
at these old videos of mine I wonder
sometimes like was that old video me
really thinking that's what I wanted
like part of me is like yeah I think
that's what I really did want but I
think part of it was made being anxious
and just being scared to commit because
I'm telling you even though I went to
school I don't think you've learned
enough at school of like actually
applying I didn't feel confident and
like doing other people's makeup like
you know I have to curl someone's lashes
like oh all those things which now it's
like with practical use you learn like
okay tell them to put their eyes or look
this way or look that way or whatever
you get just more comfortable with
practice like that and although at
school we practice putting makeup on
each other we're doing it with friends
that we've made for the whole year it's
just not as scary as doing a random
person you've never met before on top of
potentially someone that has you know is
more famous or rich or something like
that you know so you just wonder if that
is why if that anxiety is really what
was leading me to make that choice at
least a little bit I don't know I'm just
feel really blessed and grateful that I
was pushed out of my comfort zone to be
where I am today which again it's only
like months in the future I mean in July
which is the month I told you guys that
I
you uploaded the least amount of videos
like 10 videos I worked every day I'm
telling you every single day of that
month I had a gig every day I was doing
a show on Fox called so me which was
just doing like test marketing I like it
aired on fox but it wasn't in every
single market and it was just a 20
episode thing so hopefully that will get
picked up in the future I don't know if
it will but I was doing that for the
whole month of July and then that was in
turn with the show I was doing on e and
then like it was just crazy I worked so
much and I just I can't believe that I I
still uploaded 10 videos a month and so
gaga down on myself about like oh not
uploading and all these things but it's
like I don't know I just need to stop
putting pressure on myself that's part
of like what this whole video is about
was just like you know if you're someone
who also has a tendency to do that I
think it's really smart sometimes just
to like look back and like get a
realistic idea of what you've actually
done or are doing because i know i can
get down on myself too because now that
my work schedule is not nearly as busy
as that one month was i might only do a
couple days a week but luckily it's
making me enough money that i would be
making if i was working a full-time job
somewhere else and then I saw the time
to do YouTube to do other things to keep
my kit nice all these other things and
be available for gigs because kids pop
up literally last minute like it'll be
like nine o'clock at night so i'm gonna
be like hey kid are you off tomorrow
like can you do this tomorrow it's like
oh yeah i can so it makes sense for me
to not tie up all my time in a full-time
job when i could be making when i am
making the same amount of money now with
what I'm doing so anyway um that was
just something I've been thinking about
it's just like you know if you're like
that just to not put as much pressure on
yourself I really had to look at okay
yeah I'm only working two days a week
but really add up how much money I'm
making and all these other things to be
like okay Lauren don't be so down when
you haven't worked four days in a row
and and try to be productive in those
days and do stuff and have projects and
be excited and try to like you know do
something productive and positive and
just being down on yourself for like not
having work you know which i think is
crazy like I don't know I just I just
want to go I want to be a hundred all
the time so when I'm like have a day off
I'm fine is like one day off if I'm
already scheduled like a million days
after that but just having like days off
and not necessarily knowing when the
next day comes is really hard for me and
I'm realizing that and trying to like
figure that out anyway let's talk about
like my channel too I think that another
big thing I've like realized in the last
year and when I look back on my channel
is how much I've grown and I started my
channel with project panning and I love
project panning and in my first chitchat
video I talked about how my channel
isn't just going to only be about that
anymore and I've shown that like I've
posted some vlog videos I've been
posting more halls in normal because I'm
not really restricting myself as much
but what I think's crazy is I really
don't feel like I've bought any more
makeup than I did last year i think i
just felt more guilty about my makeup
last year instead of feeling like
excited about it when I did purchase
something I think I just felt more
guilty but honestly I really do feel
like so much about me and my buying
habits has changed like I don't feel the
desire to like buy everything I see
people will talk about and that could
have to do with the fact that I'm like
using my kit in a professional way now
so it's not that it's not as exciting
it's just um it's just like also work
it's just not as exciting to go into
sephora to me when I go into pro stores
and buy stuff all the time for my kid I
don't know I don't know what it is I
think just like my my relationship with
makeup and buying makeup and you know my
beauty channel has just changed because
I'm changing and I still love you tube
and doing videos and having my channel
it's just not so obsessed with using
things up and it's also not so much
about constricting so like I don't
foresee myself ever doing like an
inventory video again because it just
doesn't matter like I feel like I'm
doing a good job of like to cluttering
and using things up and using things in
my kit and also sometimes I don't want
to declutter stuff even if i'm not using
it everyday because a gig might come up
where it's like perfect i have the
perfect thing for it I don't have to go
buy something for like a special
look or something trying to think I
don't know I I have like a bunch of
stuff that I was just thinking about
when I look back at my channel and I've
I finally it's been about a year since I
quit my job which I did a whole video
about like quitting my job why I quit my
job and I think back at that video and I
don't know I just wasn't in a good place
and I'm so glad I'm not in that place
anymore that's another thing when I look
back at my channel it's so cool to see
how far I've come kind of like project
panning you know when you're using
product over and over you feel like even
though you've made a lot of progress you
don't see that progress because you
don't have a mark on it YouTube's kind
of like my mark and I can look back and
be like oh my gosh like so much has
changed in my life like I can't believe
that I've been jobless basically a whole
year now I quit my job like my beauty
job back and knocked no November fourth
I remember because it was right after we
got back from Peru I quit that job and
that was my last day there and I haven't
had I had like a weird two-week stint
somewhere but since then I've only been
doing freelance stuff and I just can't
believe that's my life like I can't
believe that it's going to be another
Christmas where I'm not working retail
we went to the mall yesterday because we
went and saw a movie and we were looking
around and as like oh my gosh I can't
believe all this chris and stuffs
already in here and i realized that the
reason it's so shocking is because i'm
not working retail and usually i'm like
pumped up for christmas you know in
October because of how retail is so I
just didn't have that pumping up and
even though I didn't work Christmas last
year it was still like we talked about
it and we were preparing for it
beforehand so that's something that's so
crazy when I look back and like that why
i put my job video and I'm just glad I'm
not in that place I feel really blessed
once again that I've been able through
myself and my husband supporter and just
like with God and just everything to be
at the place I am and with the help of
like connections I've made and just
super nice people around me that I've
been able to get where I am now in such
a short amount of time to I mean it's a
year it's not five years it's just one
year it's crazy and you know I just want
to say to thank you so much for everyone
who subscribed I can't believe how many
people have subscribed to my channel
it'll be two years at the end of
februari that I've had my channel and
been posting videos that's just crazy i
look back I'm like oh my gosh it's so
weird have over 5000 subscribers which I
do have a giveaway video i filmed it a
long time ago I just haven't edited and
uploaded it yet so i will upload that
soon i'm sorry but you know I'm just so
thankful for that and if you guys have a
channel i really suggest you looking
back at your old videos and just
remembering times in your life that you
maybe wouldn't even just thoughts you've
had and just weird stuff like that so
weird to see myself because I've changed
so much another big thing too that
happened this year was like Sam guy's
thumb chopped off or part of his thumb
chopped off that was like a freaky thing
he was off of work for two months so we
were both off work for two months and
that really was like a big push for him
to like start acting and he's been doing
more auditions and he just auditioned
for something today that was like a
pretty big audition which is awesome
even though obviously not everything
he's been in or gotten the role for it's
just it's really cool to be able to see
like oh my gosh our lives are
progressing we're moving forward moving
in a positive direction and I feel that
way about my channel and I'm really
excited for the videos i want to have
come up I know I kind of let the ball
drop on pan that palette and I'm sorry I
will be filming that in my next group of
videos and just let you guys know where
I'm at it's weird like the types of
videos I used to film I used to do the
project few sit-ups every single month
like an end cap in a starting video I
was doing like that all about series
like some of these things I feel like I
just filmed and I look back and it's
like that was in january i haven't sold
one of those since january or something
time just slips away from you something
to that i think is really awesome about
this video is it's like it's almost into
the year but it's not quite the end of
the year so it's great to look back i
feel like now and realize how much
you've changed and almost set goals to
get yourself prepared for the beginning
of the year and also just like finish up
any things you don't you want to finish
out before they'll finish up things you
want to finish up before the end of the
year actually comes and still hit those
goals and still like reach some
milestones so anyway this is like a
totally rambling video and it probably
said like about 700 times and i probably
um and everything else again I feel like
you keep saying again all the time again
again again I hate it but I'm just
talking to babysit that's what comes out
that's everything I think I'm gonna in
this video here but if you have any like
suggestions of things you want me to
talk about um let me know down below let
me note you like the videos you really
like for me because again Oh next year I
i really want to keep focus on just
different videos and trying to really
come up with like a good monthly
schedule of like hitting one of those
videos every single month so like a
rehal every month a collection type of
video every month an empty is a favorite
uh you know I'm just keeping my channel
with a lot of different content I know a
lot of you guys are here for project
pants and I still going to do those I'm
just not going to have like four or five
going on at one time probably and I
still want to do those but I also just
want to have a lot of just a lot of
different content on my channel so I
think that's everything else is ended
here and thanks so much for watching
guys and I will see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
