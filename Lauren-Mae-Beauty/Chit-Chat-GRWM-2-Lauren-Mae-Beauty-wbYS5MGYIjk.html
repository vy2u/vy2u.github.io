me so I thought I would just do like it
get ready with me today just cuz i
haven't posted a tutorial in a while
it's been so much decluttering and it's
finally over i'm so glad that was just
so much stuff um thanks for sticking
through it with me um for those of you
who are watching them and if you really
enjoyed them thanks for showing your
support i really appreciated oh one
thing i wanted to get out really really
fast is my last video my nail polish
declutter i was thinking about doing
like a give away with that nail polishes
because i don't know what else to do
with it and i don't know maybe one of
you guys would enjoy it i'm a lot of the
colors i personally either have doubled
up or i don't personally like so i don't
know if that's weird to give you guys
that or do we give away with them but
anyways let me know in the comment below
if that's something you would like um
even if only like five people say they
want it all still like do a video like a
giveaway video and send it out to
someone but yeah just commenting below
if you have any ideas for that nail
polish or if you want to give away or
something like that I don't know anyway
today I'm just gonna do a get ready with
me and kind of chit chat with you guys I
have like the rest of my makeup done
right now I'm just going to use this
Maybelline quad to do my makeup and
that's it yeah um it feels like so long
since I've like actually been on camera
like talking it is oh so nice let me
tell you all right just before the eyes
the first thing I'm going to do is take
this light creamy shimmery color and put
that all over the lid i'm going to be
using i'm gonna be using this brush by
Sigma um it is a 70 brush yeah that's
something I just wanted to get out the
giveaway thing and then another thing
too um I really want to just welcome
everyone that has subscribed to my
channel recently and thank them for
subscribing I've gained quite a few
subscribers in the past like probably
two weeks so that's really exciting it's
been amazing seeing all the support from
you guys I really appreciate it
much and I'm glad you're here so thank
you um yeah it's been great Oh another
thing um with all that stuff I'm like
decluttering and stuff I am just going
to i think what i'm going to do is do
glam bot I've heard a couple people talk
about it in comments and stuff and so i
think i'm going to try to sell some of
my stuff to glam ba and I'll do a video
on it like what I'm sending how I'm
packaging it and like how I cleaned it
and stuff and then what I got in the end
for all that product and what I really
like about glam bot is that I obviously
I see how much makeup I have I have a
lot of makeup and some things they don't
want to get rid of not because I want to
use them but just because I spent so
much money on them and I'm like I don't
want to just give these away but i don't
think i'm gonna use them so that has
really helped me i'm gonna give away a
lot more stuff than what i did cluttered
to glam bought because the high-end
stuff that maybe i'm not using i'm
actually going to potentially get money
for which makes it easier to let go of
then something that I then something
else does that make sense so I was able
to kind of go through my collection
again and get rid of stuff like what I
rather have money for this or would I
rather have the actual item and that
kind of helped me declutter even more so
um yeah I'm gonna be probably doing a
video on that so um next I'm going to
take that darker brown color I'm going
to put that just on the outer like half
or one third of my eye just dust it on
there so hopefully that'll be good i
mean i'm excited to see to how much
money I'm gonna get um and kind of just
report back because i really i tried
looking up on youtube like reviews /
videos on it and I didn't feel like
there were a ton um that I really felt
confident um not that we're telling the
right information but that you know gave
me enough information that I didn't feel
like I need to make a video that make
sense
um what else oh I got a job I have a job
finally here in California I'm so
excited I am one on my second interview
yesterday and I got a call on the way
home and I accepted the offer so I'm not
going to say where it's at because I I
don't know whatever that's just weird to
me but um it's out of beauty store here
in california and i am the skincare like
department manager um so that's really
exciting um I'm really excited too
because I really don't know that much
about skincare like I would not say
that's like a Forte of mine but I'm
really excited to learn and we have like
weekly meetings with actual brands on
how their products work so I'm really
excited for that and I'm just excited to
be going into management position I
worked really hard to be a store manager
and work my way up that long ago um
while I was in college and everything so
it was really nice to not have to go
into like an entry-level position just
because I started over and moved out
here like that's really nice that they
really you know they want me to be there
and they trust me to be able to do you
know the job I'm supposed to do so I'm
really excited for that um I'm just
excited to be working I like working I I
realized as much as it's like oh my wish
it wasn't working like now I like to
work um I want to make sure on camera
that it looks like it's halfway even on
my eyeballs that's something I've
noticed like the lighting on camera can
totally change how you look how your
makeup looks I'm basically done with
that whole thing hopefully that looks
even um next I'm going to just be lining
my lower lash line with you guys stood
the same one I always do just that Brown
steel line arm but yeah I'm really gonna
it's full time to which I'm really
excited to be put something
no put something what my thing I'm
really excited to be put into something
full time even though I'm still going to
school because I already did that before
and as much as like makeup school I'm
not saying it's easy but it's definitely
different than going to college like
regular college full time so I have no
problem since I already did that once
work full time I went to college full
time that I will be able to handle
beauty school while i work full time so
it's just super exciting and like this
is my goal was Charlie's do something in
the beauty field like I'm realizing as i
go to school that as much as I like
applying makeup I really like just
products themselves and like product
like the differences between products
and how different products work and all
of that like new releases and like just
again products themselves so I'm really
excited to be selling actual products
and not like only doing makeovers or
something I know some people would only
love that but I think like I want to go
into like product development or
something like that just because um I
love just that whole aspect of makeup I
love it I love it um ok now I'm going to
take the dark blue in the palette I'm
going to be putting that on my lower
lash line with this like stiff angled
brush also another horrible not another
horrible thing because getting a job was
amazing but horrible thing that happened
to me yesterday I was home and Sam was
at work so I was like oh man order pizza
so the pizza gets here and I'm like yeah
I'd be done then I take like three bites
and the third vitam like I go for the
crust instead of like eating a pizza
like normal person and a piece a little
diamond piece of the crust got stuck in
my throat it is still stuck in my throat
I mean obviously I can breathe so I'm
not like I wasn't like dying alone but
like it hurt so bad and I thought maybe
at first just like scratch me like when
you eat a chip wrong no it I'm pretty
sure stuck in my throat so I webmd dit
which luckily it wasn't like you have
cancer
going to die in 10 days because I feel
like that's what happens when you webmd
anything about any illness about
yourself you're like and I'm dying and
it's cancer but um it was at least
really helpful and like told me you know
to not basically freak out so that was
good but it's been horrible and it is a
lot less today but I drink hot tea I
drink water I tried to salivate more so
that my like little things in mice live
I could break down a piece of crusty
bread in my throat that didn't even help
then it told me to sorry to be so
graphic to throw up like or gag myself
so I was doing that like i was doing
everything I could and it just hurts so
bad it was horrible but luckily I woke
up this morning and it doesn't hurt as
bad like it can still tell it's there
it's like right down here it's horrible
it's so horrible guys um it's the worst
and instead of it like persists for like
days to go get it you'll have to get it
removed by doctor but I'm really hoping
that won't be the case because I don't
want to pay for something to get rid of
moved from my throat like please i'm not
paying you okay anyway but yeah that one
just is just a horrible experience that
I could share with you um now I'm going
to take the light blue from the palette
it's like a really pretty I see light
blue it's this one here and I'm going to
be putting that on my inner corner and
kind of dragging it down the lower lash
line with this Sigma pencil brush I did
this look once before because I've been
having this in my makeup basket and I
thought it was nice i get simple um but
still like a pop of color something
different I really like how this blue
like brightens the eyes up to boom baby
next thing I'm picking my nose just
getting edging it um the next thing I'm
going to be doing is tight lining with
my mega Forever aqua eyes little liner
and I will be right back because again I
can't I can't do this
it's too freaky and I can't do a good
enough job while i'm gone i'm also going
to do my Rimmel Kate Moss mascara I'm
gonna put that on my upper and lower
lash line so I'll be right back guys
okay guys I'm back that is like the
finished I look for now and then um I
decided for lips I'm just gonna go
really neutral minis my sugar rose a
fret my fresh sugar rose a lip balm and
oh it's breaking so that's the final
look guys
okay guys I hope you enjoyed this video
I will see you in my next one again let
me know about the giveaway in the
comments down below just in case anyone
wants it um because I didn't do like any
like giveaways or selling this stuff I
was getting rid of her like Max will
make up I thought at least I could do
maybe a giveaway and with my nail polish
so anyway I will see you in my next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
