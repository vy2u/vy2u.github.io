learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me and I'm excited just to chitchat
catch up there's a lot of exciting
things that have happened I'm back from
Arizona if I mention Arizona another
effing video my gosh I think all of our
heads are gonna explode but anyway I'm
excited because I'm using two new
pallets I'm probably only gonna use one
of these actually but I have two new
pallets and these are on my what brands
I wanted to try 2018 so these are from
juvy this place I got the Zulu palette
and then I also got the Saharan palette
I'm so excited this is the one I'm
pretty sure I'm gonna use because it's
the one I was the most excited to get
I'm gonna be doing something with the
green I think I'm gonna put that on my
lower lashline really buffed out and
then I'm gonna use these colors on the
lid so something kind of fun and then
I'm gonna be playing around with these
later so I can get a review up at some
point for you I'll show you the inside
of the Zulu palette though I got an
amazing deal on these I bought these
before my no buy because I started my no
buy on the first and right before
Christmas I want to say it was even the
day before Christmas or so they were
having an amazing deal so I got both of
these palettes for $30 with shipping
what so I couldn't pass that up since
I'd known I'd wanted to try this brand
for such a long time I was like you know
thirty dollars with shipping like that's
my final total for two pallets I'm gonna
just go for it I'm gonna try to make
this more of an actual get ready with me
so in the sense that I'm not gonna be
mentioning products as much I'm gonna
try to unlisted we'll see how it goes
usually I just tell you guys as I go but
I have a lot to talk about and I want to
just chitchat so I hope you guys had an
amazing holiday I know for me I had a
great time in Arizona but it was you
know it's always a little bit stressful
and I'm glad that we were able to go
back for two weeks but two weeks is a
long time this was a lot of primer two
weeks is a long time you know and so
it's just nice to be back I'm definitely
someone who likes being in my routine
and being comfortable and that's
something that's just definitely a trait
of mine a personality trait or something
that I just
I'm like I just I want to get back to
routine like let's start the hustle
again let's go and I felt like I was on
pause but I'm really happy I was able to
upload so many videos when I'm over
there I think that's the best I've done
ever
uploading even when I'm not in town so
I'm just glad that I could keep being
consistent on my channel and yeah that's
a great something that's been kind of
crazy well there's so many things like
I've had so many amazing things happen
already at the beginning of this year
but one is that my worlds are kind of
colliding more than they ever have my
real life you know and then YouTube so
that's been a strange feeling but also
really exciting so I met a subscriber
that was really weird in person her name
I believe is Kayla so I don't know if
Kayla's watching this but hi Kayla
and I met her in Arizona and we were
inside this star and she came up to me
and I was like hey I have something like
a really weird question to ask you and I
thought for sure she was gonna ask me
about my glasses cuz that's usually the
question I get is like Oh where'd you
get your glasses or like can I ask you
something where your glasses from and I
was like oh yeah
and then she's like do you do youtube
videos and I was like it was this moment
of like pure panic and I know that I
handled it so poorly so I'm sorry girl
if I made you feel really weird cuz I
felt so weird it's a very strange
feeling I told her guy I'd do YouTube
and she was like oh my gosh I've seen
your videos like I really like your
channel blah blah blah and I was like oh
yeah I was like this is so weird she's
like oh I'm sorry I'm like oh no no like
you're not weird I'm weird ah like I
definitely need to get better at meeting
people because I'm just like it just is
such a like a strange feeling that
someone knows you from what you put out
on the Internet as someone who posts not
only on YouTube but just so many videos
on YouTube I almost forget that they're
like going out to a ton of people
it's just weird with someone you don't
know just like comes up to you and like
knows you and recognizes you it's just
like a strange feeling it gets super
awesome I just need a handle it better
cuz I was probably made her feel more
uncomfortable than I was feeling
I'm so sorry girl but that's like the
first time that's happened I've had it
happen I guess one other time when I was
at IMATS and but that's like a different
thing like that's where all these making
people are together that was like the
first time it was just like random we're
just in the store he's really cool and
she's like can I have a hug and I was
like oh my gosh it's so weird like
someone wants a hug for me like Who am I
you know what I mean so that was just an
amazing experience and something that I
vowed to myself is just try to have to
be such a freaking weirdo and real-life
so that was really cool and like this
colliding of my two worlds you know and
then for the first time ever I actually
booked a gig because someone found me on
my youtube channel
her name is Adriana but she is a voice
actor here in LA and she wanted to get
some demo reel footage so she emailed me
up and asked me what my rate was and so
yeah we did that and that was really
cool too it's still like kind of weird
because again I didn't really talk about
my channel and my real life like I've
only started probably in the last like
three months now that it's a little bit
I don't wanna say that it wasn't
successful before but now I mean it's
pretty dang successful in my eyes so
it's like I don't feel as weird talking
about it but I'm definitely not the
person that's like telling everyone in
their family like watch my youtube
channel or like spamming it out or
that's just not my style I'm not trying
to like say you shouldn't but that's
definitely not me I'm like I only want
people who want to watch it I don't care
if you're my family or not I'm not gonna
like I don't know that's just how I am
this so when I'm on set or when I meet
people that's I never would be like oh
I'm oh I'm a youtuber I have a youtube
channel I would never just like bring
that up off the bat so meeting someone
where that is like how they know you
from YouTube and they know you know
things about you but you don't know
anything about that it's just like a
strange it's just a strange world
strange world that they're like
colliding and pitts cool though it's
like definitely like amazing and awesome
it's just something I'm not used to
something that's definitely like a
switch up for me but really really
awesome and it was a good time we did
the demo real and stuff and yeah I'm
really happy she reached out and that we
did
it was a really cool experience so for
today's luck let me just talk a little
bit about it I'm kind of going for glowy
I did the primer I did the illuminizer
and then I used my makeup forever
foundation I just wanted to go to
something like this is just so good guys
I used it the other day and I was like
wow my skin just looks good so those two
things have been just amazing and such a
great start to like the end of last year
and the beginning of this year but then
recently I was featured on the trending
page I was I was picked as a creator on
the rise by YouTube super weird and
random and if you guys follow me on
Instagram you saw me post that but yeah
I was picked by YouTube to be a creator
on the rise which means they featured me
on the u.s. homepage for 24 hours on the
trending tab and that was such an
exciting email to get I got that email
the day before it happened so I knew it
was gonna happen before I just like
randomly showed up there and that was
super cool I had a couple people like
text me and be like oh my gosh you're on
the trending page that you know we're
like well I just got on my youtube
inside you it's so cool and it was such
an amine it's amazing to be called out
by YouTube but like in a good way and it
called out in a positive way and by
YouTube so that was such an amazing
feeling but with that there comes a lot
of hate and so I wanted just to address
that one I'm gonna leave my tube talk I
did on hate comments and trolls because
I think that that will give you guys an
idea of like how I feel about hate
comments I just want to one let you guys
know like the hate comments don't bother
me I mean obviously I don't want them to
leave me hate comments about how fat I
am um but they don't like they don't get
to me so don't worry about like you know
I mean defending me or any of that like
I'm 100% secure in Who I am I think I
handled it really well one because I
knew there's gonna be this influx of
hate I'm pretty sure the reason that
YouTube even sends out that email is to
warn you about the hate because they're
like hey you don't tell anyone but
you're gonna be featured and also just
you know go through and make sure you
moderate your comments now like that's
literally what that email is for is
we know you're gonna get insane amounts
of hate that no one should ever get so
just like protect yourself prepare for
the troll army right but I just want to
let you guys know like I'm fine I'm
totally fine and I think that when I was
prepared mentally for it because of that
email and but - I don't find my
validation in the comments whether
they're positive or negative so like
what I do on my channel isn't dictated
how I feel about myself isn't dictated
by comments like even if they're
positive I mean it's great to get
positive comments do not get me wrong
but like I'm not doing my channel so
that I can get kudos or you know
anything like that I do it because I
like doing this I enjoy the channel I'm
glad that it like you guys enjoy it so I
think not finding yourself worth in
comments from strangers on the Internet
whether they're positive or negative can
help you eliminate so many like highs
and lows you know what I mean cuz it
feels great when people give you nice
compliments but when you get that one
bad one it's just like it makes your
like stomach drop and you just question
yourself and I just have eliminated that
by just like not finding validation like
I Know Who I am I think that I'm
beautiful I mean most of the comments
and you know so many of you guys really
please don't you know don't get
discouraged by the comments and again
they're not nice some of them are super
hateful but I don't know like I'm not
worried about it and so I don't want you
guys to spend your energy defending me I
mean if you want to you can report them
or you know whatever and I know that my
mom was really upset by them and I feel
like I feel more bad for my mom being
upset by them than me but you know it's
we can't control them and honestly I'm
not gonna lie I went to a couple of
their profiles just to like see because
I thought I'm going to do a tube chalk
on crater on the rise and it's gonna be
kind of like a scientific breakdown like
a cost-benefit analysis of it because
it's amazing that YouTube does that and
shouts out a creator
I didn't even really know this program
existed but I guess anyone who has over
a thousand subscribers can potentially
be a creator on the rise you don't have
to apply for it I didn't pay anyone for
it like they just really emailed me guys
so anyway it's amazing that they do that
but there's a lot of like negativity
that comes with it and so I think it'll
be cool to like go in and look at the
numbers and look at it very
scientifically and like cost-benefit
analysis of it and yeah that's how I was
like looking at the whole day yesterday
I don't know that's part of YouTube and
if you're getting a lot of hate you're
growing oh no I didn't bring any powders
out to powder my frickin face let me go
get that really fast oh gosh I just
kicked the camera so anyways I went to
one of their channels or whatever and I
mean it's just seriously
children you guys it's children I I
think that my like sentiment in that
tube talk was like these are the people
that are like crazies at a party you
guys like do not feed into them do not
respond back like so many of them are
just hanging out on my channel like
hours later coming back to comments so
it's like they have nothing to do with
their time I'm sorry but like my time is
too valuable to respond to that to
engage in that to acknowledge that so
yeah don't let it bother you please it's
not bothering me I'm doing me homie like
I don't care I I literally like could
give two shits so yeah I thought it
would just let you guys know that but I
am like so excited that I was the
creator on the rise I would not take
back that experience but I can't imagine
if you did find validation I mean so
many of those comments would be so
hurtful you know what I mean so it's
definitely I'm glad that it came at this
point because I feel like you know if
your earlier on in your YouTube career
or I don't know if you're not super
secure in yourself that that could be
really devastating and not as much of a
success as you would think it should be
since it's like such an amazing
accomplishment to be recognized out of
all the YouTube creators I mean it's
only for 24 hours but I mean that's
amazing right so
yeah that was so cool I'm really happy
about that such a great way to kick off
the year you know and I mean yeah don't
worry about me guys uh uh still me
still doing me homies I'm excited to do
that to talk some other videos that are
coming up though that I'm filming today
I'm gonna be filming the the tube top
I'm drawing on which I think the reason
I've been putting it off for so long is
that like it's just such a big topic and
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
cover it all and you know like I just
want it to come across right and that's
something that I really try to do with
my tube talk I'm not trying to add to
the drama I'm not a drama channel but I
like talking about topics and I tried to
do it respectfully I try to look at all
sides I try to ignite conversation and
not just like my mentality or like you
know again not trying to get our
pitchforks out and like go crazy on
people instead I really hope to spark
conversation and just real discussion
and thought because I think that there
are issues and that they should be
brought to attention I don't think we
should just not talk about them they're
there but there's a way you can do it
respectfully without I think like
hurting everyone's feelings and you can
you know talk about some hard situations
I just really love the way that
foundation sets on my skin and looks
it's absolutely amazing I really want to
go for a glowy look today so I am taking
this for more dollar I know this is this
Saharan palette but I kind of want a
like garden-party
kind of look is what I'm going for I
guess with that green and then kind of
like a soft pink or something and that's
kind of where my head's at with it I
forgot but I also want to highlight with
this new product I got so I've bought a
few things before the end of the year
with the sales and stuff and I had some
gift cards this is from Becca and it's
the champagne dream flashes Bellini
highlighter it came with the lip gloss
for like seventeen dollars I think and
I've been wanting these these have been
my wish list when they were still full
price and I thought that was such a
great deal to get both of them so I went
for it I think I was like 18 dollars
away from being Rouge
this year and then I was like I'm gonna
just buy something on it last day of the
year so I can get Rouge and I never did
and I'm like why would I force myself to
buy even something for $20 for Rouge I
already have the $10 like the shipping
so I don't need pallets right when they
release I don't know so I'm kind of I
didn't you know just purchase something
to get Rouge all right I'm gonna do my
eyebrows off-camera and I will come back
and we will do the eyes and yeah
continue this get ready with me
so before we did eyebrows I was telling
you guys about what videos I'm filming
so I'm gonna be doing that drama Tube
talk and I hope I do it well I just need
to do it and it is what it is you know
trust myself and whatnot so yeah that's
gonna happen I'm also doing a Sephora
like items I'm surprised you're on sale
on Sephora it's gonna be basically like
the opposite version of the things I
wasn't surprised from to Sephora you
guys had said you wanted to see the
opposite of it and so yeah I'm gonna do
that today
and then I'm gonna be doing a new Beauty
launches it's been so long since I've
talked about new products and what I
think about them so I am excited to do
that because it's just been seriously
way too long and my voice is just
cracking it's giving out we're on to the
eyeballs I'm so excited I'm just setting
them and then we'll get to work so um
I'm going in with a transition color
that's actually not in the palette this
is orange soda from anastacio I just
wanted to lay down a bit of a lighter
base the color in there is a nice I mean
I could use it as a transition I just
think I'll get a better blind if I go
know something just a little bit lighter
beforehand plus is is gonna add more
warmth to the overall crease instead of
just those like brighter darker orange
colors feel like it's been a while since
I used that color and it's just
beautiful it blends out beautifully I
just really love him I think I want to
try to get some more honest azu singles
this year probably during the Black
Friday sale like when it comes up I know
I missed the one that just happened but
they usually go on sale for like such an
amazing deal so I think I might save up
some money and invest in a couple shades
when that happens
all right we're going into the pallet
I'm so excited this is just as beautiful
as I thought it was
I'm going to be going into cocina
Katsina that one here and I'm just going
to be deepening up this crease or
transition color and I'm keeping it
mostly to the outer portion of the eye I
guess we're getting into a little bit of
tutorial mode here but I wanted to talk
about some other things so me and Sam on
the way home from Arizona we were
listening so audiobooks are just the way
that I like to read books if I read
books it's like I want to read books but
I never make the time to do it I'd
rather watch a show or watch a movie or
film YouTube videos or literally do
anything else but in the car sometimes
it's easy on like a road trip to just
pop in an audiobook pop it in like I'm
putting it in the cassette player but
you know what I mean it's oh should I
play it so anyway we started reading the
book you are about us at making money
and I really love self-help books I
don't know about you guys are just like
inspirational books I think that they're
great like I don't I highly suggest them
and so one of my goals this year is to
read one a month is what I want to do
and this one is particularly really good
and I think I'm thinking about making a
video on each one that I read and just
like kind of you know giving you guys a
little summary of it and you know how I
want to apply it into my life and you
know the key points that I thought were
really interesting or cool and something
so far we're on chapter six of it and I
think there's like 12 chapters but it is
just really one I already feel like I
think a lot of the things in this book
so if anything it's just kind of like
solidifying them and just like you know
helping me remember them on my day to
day life but I think there's something
really interesting about how she talks
about money and how you know our society
has given like a negative connotation to
having money and being rich even though
money doesn't it's just neutral right
you know like it's how people act it's
like the person not the money that makes
you a bad person and so there's nothing
wrong with wanting to make money there's
nothing wrong with wanting to be rich as
much as money can buy you happiness
money can buy a lot of things and can
make a lot of people happy at the same
time and I think like if you want to
like just feel inspired or whatever I
suggest reading into this book so far I
mean you know I haven't finished it
obviously but if you were interested I
would check it out or if it sounds
interesting I think our minds are so
powerful and you know you can be
stuffing your own self from doing things
you want to do without even realizing it
and I just think like I just I love
self-help books so cool I highly suggest
it I'm gonna leave it link down below if
you want to check it out I'll leave just
like the I am is online not though I'll
leave a link to the audible in Amazon
one okay so I went in with this color
here Sokoto and it's really bright
really vibrant so far these are blending
amazing like I'm actually really really
really really happy with how they're
blending so I'm gonna go in with this
color here zoya on my finger and I'm
going to just be tapping that on the lid
this color is like pink but also gold
it's a very interesting beautiful shade
honestly though I think that my eye look
is so blended and pretty right now I
really like the way that looks I'm gonna
go in on my inner corner and go in with
the shade aimin this is a bit cool toned
I feel like for the rest of the palette
but I think it'll give us that really
bright inner corner look that I like to
do I'm really excited with seriously my
first impressions of this palette it's
like one of the best first impressions
I've had of a palette in a really long
time so hopefully that they stay true to
that I will of course you know come back
with like a review and everything on
these I have a white liner here this
one's from wetting wild I thought it
would try it out it has a pearl to it
though so that kind of sucks I'm just
gonna be putting it on my inner corner
or inner waterline and then I am gonna
bring a little bit down just to give the
green a base to kind of stick to so for
the green I'm going in with the shade a
lot of me
is that I don't know if that's how you
say it but it's so beautiful I love it
so much so I'm going to be taking it on
a angled brush and I'm
at first just kind of packing it on
because I really want that color to
stand out and I might be bringing it
down pretty far again just so that that
really sticks out I feel like it's not
translating while on camera but in real
life it looks absolutely beautiful I
love it so much I think I might go into
the Zulu palette though and just see if
I can maybe accentuate that green a
little bit more I don't know I really
hope this doesn't mess up what I have
going on so I'm gonna go in I'm kind of
going into both of these I'm just gonna
put this on the outer corner I think it
did a little bit but I'm gonna leave it
there it looks really cool in person I
just wish it was translating a little
bit better on camera but you know real
life sometimes is just better
I did bring out an eyeliner so I think
I'm gonna put this like from the inner
corner just a little bit into the eye
this is the glitter liner from ELF and
sinful and it has like a lime green
shift to it so I think that'd be kind of
a fun thing to bring to the inner corner
cool like I don't know why but I did not
bring out like anything to tightline
with so I guess there will be no liner
today just mascara I'm going in with the
tarts lights camera lashes and I really
like this one but I find that it can
kind of get a little flaky it's not as
bad as the ciate when I was using but I
don't know how I feel all right so I
mascara is on we're gonna move on to
lips I'm just doing something simple
today something I've actually been
loving doing is taking my ELF exfoliator
and just kind of like getting the gunk
off my lips and then preparing my lips
for whatever I'm gonna put on them and
today I'm just going in with the lip
gloss this is something new to me from
colour-pop it's called tight fit I also
did get one of the new like colour-pop
liquid shadow so I'm gonna do something
with that soon hopefully but I was just
feeling this color on the website so I
decided to pick it up it's like a it's
metallic but it has like a bit of a dual
chrome to it too it's really pretty I
really like it and the formula of it is
nice and last but not least I'm gonna
spray my face this is the Milani make it
laughs finally picked it up y'all it was
on my wish list and I got
so I'm gonna spring my face with this
and then I'll show you final look all
right so this is the final look guys I
hope you enjoyed the video I'm so
excited and so happy with how this
palette performed it I think it looks so
good and in real life it looks like even
more poems so I cannot wait to use this
more I haven't been this excited to use
a palette in a while even though I've
gotten a lot of them so that is really
exciting anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and just kind of
chit-chatting and talking I will see you
in my upcoming videos and I hope you're
having an amazing start to the new year
and yeah I wish you the best
