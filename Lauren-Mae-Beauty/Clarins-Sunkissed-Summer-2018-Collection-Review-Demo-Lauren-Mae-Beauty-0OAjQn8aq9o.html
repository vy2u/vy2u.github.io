Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be sharing with you a
review on the Clarins Summer 2018
collection
I saw this on octoly and as soon as it
came up on the site I was like I really
want to try that out so they sent this
out to me and I'm excited to kind of get
ready with you today doing kind of a
summary type of look and sharing my
thoughts on these products I have to say
first off like the packaging on this
bronzer is just so freaking cute I know
that packaging only means so much
because it's about the product but like
the flamingos on this is so cute they're
hot pink so it's like something that
really caught my attention immediately
but yeah I'm gonna be using these
products and demoing them as I talk to
you guys about them so let's get started
I already have foundation on but I
haven't said it with a powder yet or
added concealer or anything because in
the line there are two kind of like
liquid bronzer type products they call
these like basically color correctors
one is more of a tan color at least for
my skin tone so that's a swatch of it
there I'll blend it out this first one
is in the shade zero six bronze and then
they have a deeper one and this one is
in the shade zero seven mocha and it is
quite a bit richer and deeper and that
is the mocha shade so these are really
cool I really like these types of
products especially going into summer I
think they fit a summer line really well
these are in a very similar formulation
as their primers I have the SOS
Universal primer and although this isn't
as silicone II you can use these types
of products in a multitude of ways you
can put this on your face as just like a
primer to kind of like enhance your skin
tone and maybe make it a little bit more
bronzed if the rest of your body's
bronzed you could put this into your
foundation and kind of up the color if
the foundation you're using is too light
and then how I prefer using it which I'm
going to be using 0/6 bronze because the
other one's just a little too deep for
me I like to apply it with a Beauty
Blender and I use it as basically like a
liquid bronzer kind of like how I use my
melt stick and this is just gonna add
some warmth to the skin and kind of add
some dimension back once you've used
your foundation to even out your skin
tone something I really like about this
product is although it seems like it's
going to be pretty opaque especially
from the swatches I find it sheers out
really nicely
which makes this type of product really
easy to control and to build up and
not as intimidating if it was something
that you'd have to really blend out and
something that would be difficult to use
so I love the ease of use especially
because I know a lot of people aren't
necessarily into these types of products
but I really enjoy this one a lot and I
like that you can use it for a multitude
of things so for this I kind of put it
in my contour areas I'm gonna be doing a
video all about contouring and bronzing
and kind of the differences and teaching
you I guess a little bit more than just
applying like giving you hopefully more
of like a foundation of like what the
thoughts are about contouring and
bronzing so that you can make your own
decisions and do your makeup based off
of your own face shape and features so
that will be coming but I just think
this is really nice it's very subtle and
you can build it up if you want to but I
like to just add a little bit and this
is a great base to kind of start up
before you go in with powder or if you
have dry skin you can just use something
like this instead of using a powder
I do like applying a little bit of this
to the nose as well just on the outer
sections before I apply concealer I
always do any type of like liquid
bronzing liquid contouring or cream
contouring and bronzing and then I'll go
in with my concealer over top of that or
you know in the other areas alright so
that is it applied it's very very subtle
I think it's really pretty and just just
enough to like add some life but again
it's not like taking away this is a
cream formula so it doesn't have any
shimmer to it which I really enjoy as
well and I think it's a nice product
especially for a summer collection I
forgot I usually zoom you guys in so I'm
gonna zoom you guys in and we'll move on
to the next steps just you guys know
this is what my face looks like up close
and then I'm just gonna go in with
concealer really fast I'm also gonna set
my face and then we'll move on to the
bronzer in the collection alright so I
have gone in and lightly set my face and
added the concealer it looks really nice
so let's talk about the bronzer and
apply that I know I already showed you
guys the outside of the packaging but
the inside is very interesting as well
this is what it looks like so it is a
like a try bronzer I guess you could say
it has a lighter tone that's a little
bit warmer a really nice cool toned
middle and then a deeper more warm
town on the end this bronzer is not
gonna work for all skin tones but for my
skin tone it works really really well
I'm looking really Orange the white
balance come on all right I don't think
I'm as orange as I was sorry about that
so the inside of its really nice I
really like this product and it's
something I've been using ever since I
got it and I really do enjoy it I
personally mostly stick to the two
lighter shades in here and something
that I really like about this product is
there's like no kick up in the pan like
at all I don't feel like I'm wasting any
product because nothing kicks up like oh
I can rub my brush in this thing over
and over and nothing's gonna happen but
there's still product on the brush just
you guys know all three shades are matte
which I really enjoy and I think it's
kind of nice for summer because you can
transition as you get deeper or at least
for me so like at the beginning of
summer I'm more these colors but you
know maybe toward the end of summer I'm
you know more on this side of the disc
so for me personally this is something
that's really been working out and I've
really been enjoying so if you needed a
bronzer I know we all have a lot but
this is a really nice one the formula is
great it blends nicely I find that it's
not too pigmented which is something I
enjoy I like something with like a
medium opacity because you can apply it
and build it up and just have more
control over it in general I like
products that are easy to use you know
and you don't feel like you are tempting
fate to apply them and then for today's
video I'm gonna go in with a brush I
like to kind of use for contour so I'm
just gonna focus this in the center and
I'm going to be putting this in the back
corner of my cheeks and build it up a
little bit more than normal
I'm going a quite tan today I feel like
it makes sense with the collection and
just kind of what I want to do I'm also
gonna really take it under my chin and
then I always like to go back in and
just kind of brush over with my powder
brush
and the areas where I feel like maybe
the bronzer is the most intense
especially my forehead because I tend to
be pretty heavy-handed and it just kind
of blends everything together I'm going
to apply a blush and a highlighter and
then we're gonna move on to the eyes
which I will do in depth with you guys
and yeah we'll continue on the school
look for my eyes today I'm gonna go
pretty natural so I'm just gonna be
using a bunch of different color pop
singles and I am going for just a more
basic look today I already have my eyes
primed I want to build up a base so that
way I can put a liquid shadow on and
that's kind of all I'm gonna be doing
the first color I'm gonna go in with is
issues and it's like a peachy shade I'm
just putting that in the crease alright
now that I have that down I'm gonna go
in with this color here
it's the shade Killswitch and I'm going
to be putting that mostly on the outer
portion of the eye but just in the
crease as well and building up that
color now that we have a base down I'm
gonna go in with this liquid shadow from
model zone and I'm just going to be
placing this on the first part of the
lid and we'll be blending and tapping
out to that second part and I think I
just want to add one layer of that cuz I
don't want it to get too like crumbly
and cakey or anything like that so I'm
just gonna do the one let that dry and
then we're gonna go in and deepen up
that outer corner and then just to make
sure we have the depth we need for this
eye look I'm going in with the shade a
little boat and I'm gonna be putting
that on the outer corner so that's a
look great now I'm not really feeling
the lid shade so I'm gonna go in and
just put some aboard short over it with
my finger and go more golden I like that
a lot better I'm also gonna take one of
these Oprah highlighters in Rodeo Drive
I believe and I'm just gonna tap right
on the center of my eye there we go
we're getting somewhere to the next
product in the collection let's talk
about that this is the eyeliner pen and
this is something that's very very
unique I feel like to Clarins they've
come out with one of these before where
there are like multiple different pen
colors that you can have for eyeliner
and I think that's so awesome
I was intrigued by that first one and
this is like the summer edition so
packaging wise again it has really cute
packaging with the little like palm
fronds and stuff like it's just super
cute and then color wise it has a black
a purple it also has like a coral and a
blue which I think are really
interesting this is
something I'm probably taking to Italy
with me because you just get so many
colors in one thing when it comes to
formula on this this is a nice formula
it's creamy but not overly like gliding
and creamy these do stay on the eyes
really really well they're pigmented
those are some swatches so I just I
think this is a solid formula it's not
necessarily my favorite formula I've
ever used but I can't really find any
Fault in it so I've really been enjoying
it oh my gosh that's not an eye liner
it's a lip liner literally just saw that
right now I was gonna totally use this
on my eyeballs well I'll be using this
as a lip liner day I haven't used this
as a lip liner because I just assumed
this was all for the eyes I feel so
stupid anyway so how you use this is you
push these down and when you push down
another one it pops up the other product
down in the pen if you've ever used
these in like an actual pen form it's
the same thing and then when you want to
twist product out when it's out you just
twist this way so it's really easy
simple to use and it's kind of like a
fun thing but today I'm gonna be using
the turquoise on the bottom lash line I
already did a look like this actually
really recently but we're doing it again
that one was a bit more cool toned and
this one's going to be warmer
and I'm just blending that out with a
brush I'm also gonna take this on the
actual water line cuz I just wanna see
what that looks like you guys know I
normally do white on the water line but
I think it's kind of a fun look and it
almost is like this infinity pool effect
when you have it on the lower lash line
and the water line like it just runs
straight into your eyeballs I'm also
gonna be using the black today to
tightline with and I find this works
really well it's very pigmented and rich
but the formula doesn't tend to move
around too much for me so that's what
all the liners look like on I am going
to put a little bit of the golden Rodeo
Drive on my inner corner and then to
finish up the eyes I'm just gonna go in
really fast with some mascara and I'll
be back and we'll do the lid I'm excited
to try that lip liner with the other lip
product in here alright so so far this
is a very like classic summer look I
feel like it's a golden bronze the eye
with that pop of aqua it's really pretty
I like it so let's move on to lips I'm
going to be using the lip liner and I
feel horrible but I have not tried this
as a lip liner so sorry about that guys
I think I was just like so excited about
this being a bunch of eyeliners and I
even thought like wow that's really
progressive of them of Clarins to have a
pink eyeliner no and I'm gonna be
filling in my whole lip with this
because the other product that they have
in this collection is a lip they're like
instant LaToya let's see what they call
them instant light lip comfort oil but
this is kind of a darker shade although
it does shear out but I want to have an
even base for it to go on top of alright
so those are my lips filled in this is a
very intense color it's like a hot pink
I thought it was like more coral when I
just do a swatch but when you see more
of this color altogether it definitely
does come up a lot more hot pink okay so
let's go in with the lip product this is
the last product in the line so I
actually do have another one of these
these are something I really like the
formula of the instant light lip comfort
oils like I said before I have the mint
one and this is really great it has like
a subtle like sweet mint flavor it's
very comfortable on the lips it does say
it's an oil but I find that it's more of
like a gloss consistency
without any stickiness so it's basically
like a super comfortable moisturizing
gloss and not thin like an oil
I feel like oil is almost misleading in
this sense that it doesn't feel like an
oil at all on the lips this has the same
exact formula as the other one I've
tried it just has a different color and
that's what makes this so much different
so there's a swatch of it like I said it
sheers out so much more than what you
see in the tube so this looks a little
intimidating but it just adds this kind
of like juiciness to the lips this is
the shade zero eight black berry and
this has almost like a black berry type
of scent to it again kind of mixed with
vanilla I have some set memory tied to
basically this exact scent and I cannot
like remember what it is but it's like
when I smell it it makes me think of
something but it's like on the tip of my
tongue what it is I just can't place it
but I've smelled this before it smells
really nice um overall I think that it
gives the lips a really nice juicy look
I love the doe foot I know it's like
huge and sometimes with this color it
can be a little bit difficult to apply
to the lips but I think that it's just
such a soft applicator it's fast it's
easy and overall I do really like these
I just don't think I would necessarily
pick this color so here is the look I'm
gonna zoom out and kind of give you guys
an overview of the products and kind of
like just summarize everything I said as
I've been applying them in a yes or no
and just kind of my overall thoughts and
we'll finish out the video alright so
overall on the summer collection from
Clarins I think it's a really nice
collection I definitely get some revives
from it from most of it and I really
enjoy the packaging I think it's a
little bit of a younger vibe then I feel
like I think of Clarins and I think
that's really nice but I feel like
everyone could enjoy it at the same time
I'd have to say that my favorite product
is the bronzer this works really nicely
for my skin tone I love the packaging I
like that it has three different colors
in it and something I was a little bit
nervous of getting it is I thought that
it might be shimmery in some way but
since it's completely matte I think it's
really versatile and will work for a lot
of people and its really great I think
this will last me forever since
basically the product is pressed pretty
hard and it's not just like fluffing up
so this is something that
I'm going to continue using and I really
do enjoy from the collection and it's
something that if you were thinking
about picking it up or it looked
interesting to you I think you would
enjoy it coming in second place I feel
like these kind of tied to me I'm very
excited about both of them but kind of
for different reasons so talking about
the liquid kind of color corrector
bronzers type of situation I think these
are really versatile products that
they're easy to use I like that they're
buildable so they're not intimidating
and like I said you can use them in so
many different ways so these are really
great they also fit in line with that
summer collection and just make me want
to go out to the beach
and also know that I'll have products
that work for the beach or the affects
of the beach if I'm super tan or
something and then on the same level the
eyeliner pen and lip liner pen is
something I really do enjoy
I think the formula is really solid and
I just more than anything love the ease
of this the fact that you can bring this
one thing and have three different
eyeliners is amazing when it comes to
the lip liner I know it's my first time
using it on the lip so I'm sorry about
that I can't give like a huge review but
overall it's not my favorite for the
lips and there's a couple reasons why
one this color isn't something I would
necessarily pick for a lip liner I think
it would have been nice to have like a
coral a nude or something like that also
this is a very similar formula to the
eyeliners like I didn't notice a
difference at all in it so like I said
the eyeliners aren't super creamy clydie
and so on the lips I just feel like I'm
tugging and because you twist this up
you don't want to twist it up too much
and I feel like that plastic applicator
is constantly like hitting my lips it
just takes a long time to fill the lips
in if that's something you want to do
and with me how I personally use lip
liners even in my kit when I apply them
on other people I don't like a super
fine point so if I sharpen it like
sanitized it and all of that I will rub
it on the back of my hand to kind of
dull the tip and then I'll kind of use
it sideways just to get a more sheer
application and kind of build up that
lip liner and because of the fact that
this is in this specific form I'm not
able to do that as much because the
plastic and all that so it just made the
application like kind of rough on the
lips and just didn't feel nice and I
just didn't feel like I could easily get
everything evenly so it's not my
favorite when it comes to lip liner for
me
just by applying it but overall with the
other products I think it's nice and
yeah I really like the packaging on this
as well so that one I feel like is a
little bit more personal like do you
think you would use it do you like those
colors and then you can make your
decision from there and last my least
favorite thing is the instant light lip
comfort oil again it's not that I don't
like the formula of this product I think
more than anything it's just the color
like you guys saw it's just a very deep
color this to me is like a fall ish
color even with it sheared out
I just find it would be a better like
more subtle fall look than it would for
spring I wish this was like a coral or
like something like that like something
or even like a hot red would make more
sense to me than this shade with the
collection or even like a pink to match
the Flamingo so I feel like color choice
wise it's a little bit confusing to me
as to why this is a part of the summer
collection and so for that reason I
don't know how much use I'm gonna get
out of this because I don't like wearing
something so dark that is like able to
transfer because these are very
comfortable almost like a lip gloss
formula but at the same time I do think
it gives a really pretty juicy look to
the lips and if you have darker lips
this might not look as deep on you and
would look really really beautiful and
just juicy and voluptuous yeah I have
like just pros and cons to this formula
wise if the formula sounds great I would
just make sure you pick the color that
you know you're gonna use and love and
that will work for your skin tone okay
guys I hope you enjoyed the review
overall I think it was a really nice
collection I don't think that anything
is like insanely groundbreaking that you
have to have in your collection but I
think they're all really Selleck
products I really like the line I like
the inspiration overall and I really
enjoy the product so I hope you guys
enjoyed the review let me know if you've
picked up any of these products down
below in the comments and I will see you
in my next video thanks so much for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
