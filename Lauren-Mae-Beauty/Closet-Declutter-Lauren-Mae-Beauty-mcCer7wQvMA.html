channel this is gonna be a different
video I am actually filming in my little
closet I've been wanting to clean out my
closet for a long time now so I'm just
gonna do it today I'm gonna film it I
wanted you guys to see kind of the way
I'm going to go through and declutter
this I don't really know how well I'm
gonna do we shall see as we go how it
goes I'm trying to just get rid of stuff
that I don't wear some of my criteria is
have I worn it or when was last time a
worid do I like the way I look in this
and is it something that fits my style
now so those are kind of things I'm
thinking of as I pick out items I am
gonna have like I could get rid of like
donate pile a potentially sell pile a
pile to try on that's like a maybe pile
and then also a keep pile so I'm gonna
open up the drawers like this isn't here
so this is the first half of my closet
there is a second half I think I'm just
gonna go through this start through this
first and go from there so we shall see
how that works out
you guys just recently saw this in a
Peru haul I'm definitely keeping my I
just got it in Peru these are a bunch of
scarves and I had this thing for my Kia
so I guess I'll go through this this is
just kind of a plain scarf it's a little
tattered so I'm gonna donate this one
this is a scarf I got it's like a square
scarf from the thrift store I do really
like it but I don't really wear it much
so I think I'm gonna pass on this one as
well I might try to sell this one though
cuz it's not in any bad condition I
don't know we'll see this is probably my
favorite scarf it's just a huge black
scarf that I got from forever 21 so I'm
gonna keep that this is a scarf that
Sam's aunt gave me so I am gonna keep
that as well it's really pretty I like
that this is just a circle infinity
scarf me and Sam switch off from wearing
these I also have it in a brown color we
got at Banana Republic I'm gonna keep
these ones for both of us this is that
other one this is a really pretty scarf
again I love the colors and everything
but I just never wear
I'm gonna pass it along I bought both of
these scarves at the same time and I
think that they're really pretty I think
I'm just gonna keep one though I think
I'm gonna keep the red one I just think
it pops a lot I think it's really pretty
I love the yellow too but I just like
the red one more so I'm gonna try to I
think sell this one it's really pretty
this is also a scarf I really like it's
a star scarf that is infinity if I can
find oh my gosh there we go it's like a
big infinity scarf I really like it
still I think I'm gonna keep that one
this used to be my favorite scarf
I wore this scarf all the time it was
from Old Navy and this is so old I am
gonna pass this one along it's time for
it to go I'm sad but I remember I used
to wear this like I used to wear this
seriously all the time like every day so
I'm gonna pass it along
this one fell that's when I got in a
PopSugar must-have box and I do really
like it it has some really cool
detailing down here on the bottom so I
think I'm gonna keep this one again it's
neutral too and it's not black something
a little different so I'm gonna keep
that and the last scarf on here was from
Sam's mom and this is one she went to
Colorado I'm gonna keep this one I think
it's really pretty
it's like multicolored it's kind of how
I wish my hair looked but I'm gonna keep
that one too I think that's pretty good
I have basically like for neutral
scarves and like for colorful scarves
and I think that's good I don't think I
really need anything else and I got rid
of five scarf so I feel really good
about that it feels good let's get into
the nitty-gritty here this is a dress
from forever 21
I'm plus-size I don't know if you guys
know that but you should at this book
point I plus-size um so a lot of me
stuffs from forever 21 because they have
affordable plus-sized stuff this is just
a black dress it's like faded I wore
this to work because we have very strict
dress code at work and I know it has a
hole in it somewhere so I am gonna pass
this along it's just kind of a basic
black dress something that I could
definitely replace and probably should
replace at this point and I don't see
myself wearing it so I'm gonna just
donate that this is a sweater I really
like it is getting a little not really
up here I've had it
for a little bit but I'm gonna keep that
it's one of my favorite sweaters to wear
so I'm gonna keep this piece this is a
little cardigan that I have I got this
from American Rag I got this right
before me and Sam got married and went
on our honeymoon I do really like this I
think it looks really pretty over like
long maxi dresses especially in the
winter like fall time it doesn't get
that cold here I'm gonna keep this one I
do enjoy it this is something I just got
at Costco it's like a activewear I don't
have much active wear so I'm gonna keep
this but I'm going to fold it into a
drawer instead of keeping it hung I want
all my actor wear to be in like one
drawer I think it'll be easier that way
so I'm gonna move this but keep it this
is just a white button-up colored
sleeveless shirt I did have this for
work and that's why I had it I'm gonna
keep it just so I have something if I
needed it for whatever reason as like
professional or whatever but I don't see
myself necessarily wearing this on a
day-to-day basis but it's just kind of a
staple piece to have something to keep
that this is an old Navy sweater I
haven't been told Navy and I don't know
how long so this is very very old I am
going to pass it even though I do wear
it sometimes because it's comfortable
but I just feel like we don't ever love
it when I do wear it I always feel like
when I do wear it like I shouldn't have
worn that I don't know I'm gonna get rid
of it though this is a sweater dress
from Lane Bryant I really like this I
didn't wear it for a long time and then
at work we had to have collars but
somehow this got a hole in it - I don't
know what happened I don't think this is
gonna be fixable I think it'll just pull
so I'm gonna have to get rid of it I
feel so bad but it's gonna have to go so
I will be passing this along as well I'm
just gonna probably I don't know if I
should donate it this has a hole I don't
know what to do with this but I'm not
gonna keep it in my closet any longer
this is another item from Lane Bryant
it's just like a black shirt with some
hardware zipper pocket and then a cowl
neck I'm gonna keep this I do like this
it's one of the items I have in my
closet that's kind of more form-fitting
I don't usually like stuff like that but
this one's a little bit more
form-fitting on me and it's nice I'm
gonna keep it this is a robe and I love
this robe I think this robe is beautiful
but
does not fit me I will flash everyone in
this robe so I'm going to get rid of it
I kept it for so long because I just
think it's so beautiful but I can't wear
it so I mean it just feels silly to keep
it right oh I'm gonna get rid of it it
has to go I'm gonna try to sell this one
though cuz it is DKNY I think I got at
Ross or something so it wasn't like full
price I think my mom I don't even know
very upsetting so sad so cute my mom
want my even wants this mom let me know
if you want this next this is an item
like a little cardigan from Target I
believe this is very very old as well I
don't shop for clothes I shot my makeup
guys and makeup always fit so I'm gonna
get rid of this I have worn this but
it's kind of just one of those things
that it's time to go and I'd rather get
a new one a nice cool new one that's
like crocheted or something more my
style this is just plain and I'm ready
to pass on this is a very wrinkled item
I need to iron it but I did get this for
work because again we had to have the
callers and I did anything I could to
make it fun and creative and look cute
in my collars instead of hideous so this
is from ASOS I'm gonna keep this I think
it's fun it's kind of nautical themed I
kind of like it it's one of those ones
though that I don't know where it
stopped but I'm keeping this not a cold
looking shirt just gonna make sure I'm
ironing it as well as if I don't wear it
in summer or anything I'm gonna get rid
of it this is the heaviest coat I own
really cute comfortable it's a little
beat-up because I've had it a long time
and since it's like cottony material it
has some balls on it but I'm going to
keep it because I don't want to purchase
anything else and I don't think I need
anything else
we're moving on now okay this is
something I just bought before we went
to Peru I don't have any other type of
flannels and I got the scent Ross for
pretty dang cheap I'm definitely gonna
keep it I think it's a fun piece really
trendy right now with like the whole 90s
thing coming back and it's nice and
neutral it has this like cotton hood on
it I like this again this is gonna go in
my aesthetic drawer just bought this
again when we go to Peru so it's just
gonna move but I am gonna keep it I
don't have a ton of t-shirts like just
graphic tees but the
is what I really like it's kind of a
genius from torrid it fits me really
nice I find sometimes with the t-shirts
because I have large boobs it is hard to
that gap in the from the boob to the
armpit type of thing kind of looks weird
usually but this one I find looks good
it fits nice it's not too baggy it's not
too tight it just kind of works out for
me so I am gonna keep this one it's just
like a casual one I like this this is a
Minnie Mouse sweatshirt I've worn this
in a video and I do sometimes weird
around the house but I am going to pass
on it because it is not something that I
would wear out in public I don't think
and I just don't want to have it just
for like lazy days because I just feel
like then I could keep everything that I
don't wear for lazy days type of things
so I'm gonna get rid of this one I think
it's cute but I just want other things
other than this like if I had to choose
other things I'd rather have them than
this so it's gonna go this is a sweater
this is a little black and white striped
sweater from Anna I don't know I think
got at Sears I do like this one it's a
little old but I do like it it's kind of
classic-looking I feel cute in it I like
wearing a red lip and like a winged
liner with this so I'm gonna keep this
this is a disgusting black regular
collared shirt but enough that most
people have to wear for work that's why
I bought it
sadly I'm going to be keeping it because
I will be getting another job at some
point and if they need me to wear
something professional this is something
I could wear and I would hate to have to
go buy these again I just hate this type
of clothing so I'm still keeping it
because I'm a mature adult and I
realized that these things need to be in
your wardrobe this is a another work
piece that I bought again trying to
figure out how I can have the collar but
still be comfortable it's from Charlotte
Russe and it is kind of like a stretchy
one again I'm going to keep this so that
I have something professional when I
need it it's not something I wear every
day but it is part of like a
professional wardrobe this is a little
sweatshirt or sweater from so I think it
was from Kohl's I'm gonna keep this it's
just cute it kind of looks like the
Victoria Secret pink stuff and I like to
these on like you know just hanging out
days and I think it's cute definitely
way cuter to me than the Minnie Mouse
ones I'm gonna keep that this is
something super fun that I just got
before I left for Peru it is like a
swing faux suede vest with the fringe I
really like this I haven't worn it yet
because it's just not it's like winter
now but I can't wait to wear this with
shorts and with like pants and dresses
like I'm gonna be so cute with a maxi
dress and I love it I'm gonna definitely
keep that this is another item I like to
wear with my maxi dresses this just goes
great with my black one it kind of gives
it a bohemian feel and it's just nice I
like this type of stuff I think it'd be
cute on the beach too I love this this
is a nice just tank top from American
Rag which is sold at Macy's if you guys
are like plus-sized and you want to know
where cute stuff is makes these have
some nice stuff too besides forever 21
but anyway I do really like this I think
it's really cute I'm gonna keep that I
feel comfortable on it I feel cute in it
it's fun it has some color to it but
it's not too far in my comfort zone I do
usually like blacks and mostly blacks
but I do like that one okay we've got to
get rid of some stuff Lauren this is
something I actually just bought I'm
going to keep it and try to wear it this
winter and see if I wear it it's very
pink it's very pink it's kind of fun I
don't know if I'm gonna wear it I was
like in the store thinking it'd be so
fun and so cute and like uh-huh you know
but in the end will I wear it I'm not
sure so I'm gonna keep it and I'm gonna
try to make myself wear it in the next
couple weeks and if I don't I'm gonna
get rid of it just because it's very
much an uncomfortable piece for me but
we'll see next this is something I
really like it's kind of rowdy but I
kind of like that about it this is from
American Rag and it's just kind of like
a crochet type of piece it has this like
mesh back here I'm really excited to be
wearing this now that I'm like layering
things and it is a little bit heavier I
do like it I'm gonna keep that piece
what I love this this is something I
actually just got before we left for
Peru it's a really pretty dress I know I
don't know if you guys can see the whole
thing there
but it's super pretty it has like this
top flowy piece hold on Sam's calling me
I scooted the camera back a little so
you guys could see stuff in a little bit
better detail but anyway this dress is
so cute I love this I haven't even worn
it yet because it's again kind of cold
here now that it's winter but I love it
I caught it on a really good deal
because it's a summery dress and I this
is something I feel really passionately
it's just so cute I'll feel so cute in
this obviously keeping up this one is
kind of one I'm having a hard time with
this is a maxi dress really cute I'll
show you this is what the bottom this is
so hard this is what the bottom looks
like it has like a wrap dress kind of
feel to it and it has it's a maxi and
it's like kind of high-low too
the thing is with this my boobs pop out
of this like crazy and so it makes me
feel uncomfortable wearing it I hope
that my boobs aren't popping up now so
I'm gonna actually get rid of this I do
love it the feel of this is really nice
but the fact that I just feel so
uncomfortable
I'd rather get something that I love
more than this then have this so I'm
gonna get rid of this it's so sad but
it's real being real with myself this is
something I've never worn it is a tiger
shirt that's like galaxy I really like
it like I don't know I do really like it
I think I'm gonna put it in the like try
to wear in the next week and then we'll
see because I think it'd look really
cool with my hair and I just like it so
I'm going to keep it but again kind of
put it in the me to wear it try it on
and if I try it on and I don't wear it
the day that I'm gonna try to wear it
then I need to get rid of it this is
another dress
it's a maxi again but it's just the same
pattern all the way down this was one I
bought that other dress and I haven't
really worn this much because it is a
little tight around me but it's so
comfortable
I think again I'm gonna try to keep this
one I know you shouldn't use like losing
weight to justify saving stuff but I
just really do like this and I don't
want to see it go yet I'm just not quite
ready to leave it let it leave so I'm
gonna try to wear this it's just so
comfortable
and I feel like I'd be trying to find
something like this if I got rid of it
so why not keep that one I have this is
yet another dress that I bought because
of work it is very like Wednesday Addams
inspired it's like a drop hemline
sweeter dress with what do they call
this where has like the drop hemline
anyway I do like this part of me really
wants to keep it because I think I look
really cute in it and I like wearing a
black lipstick so I think we're going to
keep this and again it's gonna kind of
go in that professional wardrobe because
just because I'm not working at the same
spot I do want to have some clothes now
they don't have to just go buy more
stuff so I'm gonna keep this one for now
this is a dress from forever 21 this one
is a little short I do really like it
I'm gonna keep it but it's a little
short so I think it'd be a good one
actually for winter to wear with like a
cardigan and leggings and you know some
flats or something but it's so pretty I
really like it it's really comfortable I
feel cute in it so I want to keep that I
don't know I think I'm gonna get rid of
this just cuz I don't wear it it's going
I'm gonna just get rid of it now get rid
of it now say goodbye and then I can get
another dress that I do like that I
actually have worn because I just
haven't worn it good job Lauren a trap
you just you guys like I'm thinking like
I see this dress and I see this dress
and it's like I want all of my wardrobe
to be like these how much I love those
no I'm gonna get rid of this too I just
bought it which feels like the biggest
waste but I'm just gonna pass it on or
like try to sell it or something so I'm
gonna get rid of that okay
good progress line this is something I'm
definitely keeping it's a little kimono
and I love it I just haven't worn it
much not because I don't want to but I
was working full-time and had school and
I wasn't gonna wear this to school and
get it gross so yeah I love this I can't
wait to wear it more so beautiful this
is an item my mom picked up from the
thrift store for me again it kind of
completes that professional wardrobe
this kind of fold over into a collar and
that's how I would wear this
so this is nice I'm gonna keep it again
just for that professional wardrobe
because these are things that I found
work if I have to like try to get in
there and then once I start a new job
and I know I'm gonna be there for a
while and I realized this is not
something I needs and I'll get rid of it
then but I just don't want to get rid of
it and wish I had it later this is a
mussel tank this is an older mussel tank
but it's when I wear all the time
I'm keeping it I love it I got it for me
so this is another dress I really like
it has the peter pan collar it's from
forever 21 it also has this really cute
like bow I'm gonna keep this I like
wearing this too like more special
events or whatever so I'm keeping it
this isn't undershirt I'm getting rid of
it it's too short it like rides up and
that doesn't work for me so I'm getting
rid of this this is my beloved Ramon
shirt
it is like kind of crazy looking right
now I don't know why it looks like that
I love this shirt I wore it and got
flexible sealer on it it's just kind of
my like hanging out shirt I love love
love this I feel cute in this even
though it's kind of like grungy I love
this I will not ever get rid of this it
was in a Christmas photo one such my mom
hates it's been through a lot of me this
is another shirt a super love it has
like that kind of Jersey looking top to
it but then floral print I love that mix
I'm definitely keeping that this is an
interesting I really like this I think
I'm gonna keep it and try to wear it
this winter I think it'd be really fun
to have in a Christmas photo or
something more like if you have to work
Christmas sweater I just think it's so
fun I think it'll look you with my hair
and eyebrows to know that they're kind
of like pinkish I like it I'm gonna keep
it this is something I really wanted to
have because I thought it'd look so cute
like cutoff shorts for fourth of July
and stuff even though it's like wintery
I'm getting rid of it I don't
and it's kind of just I just don't want
this I don't want it this is something I
got out Forever 21's website I like the
front of us but then it has this back
with all these cutout details I'm going
to get rid of it it's kind of old
looking I'd rather get just a black
sweater I love then keep this one so I'm
going to get rid of it this is an item
from forever 21 it is so cute I love
this shirt it's old looking but I'm
keeping it because I love it this is
another item that's old but I do love it
it's kind of ratty again but I just love
it so I'm keeping it I think I'm gonna
keep this one too it's black it has a
really cute rose gold heart I just like
it I'm gonna keep it this is my
grandpa's sweater I got this from the
thrift store I haven't worn it in a long
time I used to wear it all the time I'm
gonna get rid of it it's just not quite
my style anymore and I really wanted
another one I could go to the thrift
store I'm sure I'd find one real quick
so it's gonna go I'm sorry if I brought
keep showing I'm sorry if you don't like
my outfit I'm just kind of chilling out
this is something I'm gonna keep I do
really like it I haven't worn it cuz
it's quite heavy it's not never hot or
it's not usually cold enough to wear
this but I think it's nice for like
something that's kind of in the middle
between like wanting to look nice but
still casual and comfortable and they
look really cute like jeans and a white
shirt so I'm gonna keep it this is
something I'm going to get rid of it is
a cardigan that has like kind of a
baseball look it's kind of grandpa but I
really don't wear it so it needs to go I
feel like I'm getting rid of like half
my closet so good this is another thing
that needs to go it's just like a
cardigan from Target back when I bought
on my cardigans and stuff from Target
which I don't ever go to Target there's
not one close to us now and I don't know
the last time I bought clothes for
Target so that's old all the little
gotta go this is another target purchase
this is older but I really like it it's
a kimono and it's like sheer and just
super pretty I'm gonna keep it it has
butterflies on it I just think it's so
cute again it would look so pretty with
like that ladybird lipstick yeah I'm
gonna keep it this is another cardigan I
have I think that's really cute
but I think I might I don't know I like
it but I also part of me doesn't like it
I think I'm gonna pass it just because I
think I could find something I like it
better than this and I'd rather make
room for that other items and have this
so I'm gonna pass this along I think my
friend Bree would really like this this
is something my mom picked me up from a
thrift store it kind of looks like those
other kind of long vests I do like it
but I guess I like those other ones
better and now that I have that suede
one it's a similar color it's just too
similar to the white one and I would
always I think pick the white one over
this so I think I'm gonna pass it sorry
mom but I hope you understand I gotta
get rid of it this is something I mean
it still has a tag on and I haven't worn
it but it's so cute right it's super
cute I want to wear it so I'm going to
put this again in that pile of like try
to wear it and see how you like it and
go from there so I think it's so cute
it'll be really cute with black pants
that are kind of cuffed up I think it'd
be so cute I know I'm gonna keep it but
it's on the list
this is just a comfortable shirt it's
just like a baseball tee I'm gonna keep
this because I do think that baseball
tees look cute on me and yeah I don't
have any other baseball tees so I'm
gonna keep this again this is kind of a
more casual shirt like I'm around the
house during laundry and I can't be
naked because I've got to go down and
get laundry this is one where this is a
shirt I like to wear it's just like a
really comfy casual shirt that has a
hood it's just black I like wearing this
look like cutoff shorts I'm gonna keep
that this is a shirt that has to go I
got it from the 3rd store and it's very
comfortable but I just don't I don't
need this I don't want this this is a
shirt I used to wear all the time all
the time I got this from my mom for
Christmas like three years ago
I would wear this whenever I was at
justice in our district manager was
gonna come because I just felt like cute
but still like a little bit more classy
or something it's it's really cute but
it needs to go it's old who needs to go
I don't wear it anymore I feel like I
have other things I would go to but I do
like it maybe I should keep it actually
I'm gonna keep this because I was
thinking about it for like jobs and
stuff you
all black but this would be all black
the cute oh I think that's the first one
I've done that with right where I said I
was gonna get rid of it but then kept it
this is a shirt I usually get a lot of

my boobs and everything it's just like a
long tank top I really like this I love
the style of it everything I'm gonna
keep it this is a shirt I like from Lane
Bryant but I am gonna get rid of it it's
just not if it was a different color if
it was black I'd probably wear it but

I don't wear it so I gotta get rid of it
this is something I'm also gonna get rid
of I got this from taured but I'm not
someone who likes to show my boobs off
very much and this does cut a little low
for me and I just don't love the thing
for it on top of that like I don't like
the pattern necessarily so I'm gonna get
rid of it try to sell it because it is
nice this is one I actually like I know
it looks kind of ugly

was looking in here I have a couple of
tank tops I like better so I'm gonna get

I love this first summer I'm gonna keep
this it's so fun and this is like neon I
feel like done right in my eyes I don't

romper I'm gonna keep it and try to wear
it but if I don't wear it too soon I'm
gonna have to get rid of it

gonna keep it but it probably will go
soon okay that's everything on this side
I mean it was totally full and now we
are down to that I feel pretty good
about it let's move on to the other side
I guess I guess we'll move on hopefully
this angle isn't too awkward I'm trying
my best I'm in like a little room here
so we're gonna go through this stuff
and see what we need to get rid of I'm
hoping it can all fit on the one side
and this can just be nothing this I'm
gonna get rid of I do like it I used to
love it but um I just don't wear it
anymore so it has to go this is my black
maxi dress which I'm not gonna get rid

just walk down somewhere I do like to
wear this cuz it's easy so I'm gonna
keep it as just like kind of a running
around type of dress this is a tank top
that I'm going to get rid of but I it's
hard for me because I just love it but

this with shorts but it's like longer
than the shorts I love it this is my
shell yeah shirt I really love this I'm

kind of dress I think I'm gonna get rid
of this one and keep the other one is
like a running around dress because this
is just old gotta go
this is a lovely sweatshirt and I'm
gonna keep this one so I'll have this
one and that other one that says love it
with the turquoise kind of as my running
around I do like this
I like the soft palate usually I don't
do greys like this so I'm gonna keep it
this shirt Sam shrunk this shirt as soon
as I got it for work so I'm getting rid
of it this is a blazer this is a nice
blazer so I will be keeping that and
then I think this is another blazer this
one another blazer I'm gonna keep it too
it's a little bit different but I'm
gonna keep it again just things I don't
want to have to repurchase later I love
this I like wearing this as like a vest
over stuff it look good with my Ramone
shirt it also looks really good at that
black maxi dress so I'm gonna keep that
I have to get rid of this dress because
there's a hole in the seam here again
this is kind of like another one's day
Adam type of dress but it has to go
because it's ripped and I don't want to
fix it this is just a black American Rag
shirt it has to go it's too short this
is when I favorite black tank tops it
looks kind of lingerie it has like this
lace detailing here I love this it's
just flowy and fun yet another blazer I
know I went a little crazy I'm gonna
keep it - this is a really cute just
like fancier shirt I like to wear um I'm
gonna keep this yeah I'm gonna keep it I
bought this cuz it's like a skater dress
or skirt I'm sorry I've never worn it I
think I'm gonna get rid of it oh that's
kind of cute
I'm gonna try to style this maybe go a
little a little outside my comfort zone
normally wear skirts but I think it's
the only one I own but I'm gonna keep it
this is one of my only white shirts I
really like it has really cute detailing
here I'm gonna keep that this is a black
shirt I'm gonna keep this again if I
need something black to look kind of
professional but don't want to feel like
stuffy I'm gonna keep it
this shirt is just like a black shirt
I'm gonna put this on the watchlist it's
just black and I should wear it but I
just haven't I'm gonna keep it this is
gonna go I was gonna be a lunch lady for
Halloween with this it's way too big for
me and it's just I got it for work
because of the collar it was better than
wearing something ugly or I don't know
it has to go I love this it's like a
poncho ething and it has like like
tighter arms here keeping it this is
just a little slip I'm gonna keep that
it's nice to have this is a black and
white dress I'm gonna keep that I think
it's cute hopefully not freaking the
camera out probably is it's freaking my
eyes out I like this this is just a
comfortable dress but I think I'm gonna
get rid of it because it shows my boobs
a lot this is one I like my beach
cover-ups I really like it I that's
where the slip come from came from
sometimes I wear it alone though I like
it I'm gonna keep that last but not
least this is another kind of like
beachy dress anyway or even though it's
bark love love love it so cute keeping
it so everything does fit over here I'm
gonna cross over
I do got a few things that just have
gone wash I love that it all fits at
least on one side now I do think
eventually I can go through and get rid
of even more but for now when I know I'm
not shopping I think this is good I
think something that I can do to keep
myself on track with like keeping this
much it's like whenever I get a new
piece I have to get rid of something
that way keeping stuff that I need and
like so I have you know a variety of
different types of items to wear but at
the same time if I get something that's
similar or replaces an item in here I'm
not just adding it I can get rid of that
other thing that's my goal at this point
I will see you in my next video I'll
show you guys although what I got rid of
a really cute pile there but that's
everything I'm getting rid of I think
that is so much quite a lot so I feel
really great about that alright bye guys
