Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I want to talk about my favorite
scent coconut that is the entire
inspiration for this video and I think
I'm gonna make it into a series because
y'all know me I love a good series I
have a lot of coconut products in my
collection at the moment and I thought
it would be fun to talk about those
items give some mini reviews and my
thoughts on them and then I thought it
would be fun to talk about some products
that I'm looking forward to some things
that are in a coconut scent that I want
to try out if you have any suggestions
for me or if you have any products that
are coconuts and to definitely leave
them in the comments for me I don't know
what to call this series like right now
the only thing that comes to mind is it
makes sense to me so if you have any
suggestions for a cutesy name for this I
would love it please leave it in the
comments yeah I really love cutesy names
but sometimes it's really hard to come
up with and I'm just drawing a blank so
without further ado let's just get into
my coconut love's this is my favorite
type of scent if anything comes in
coconut that's probably the one I'm
gonna pick up I just love it I also love
the taste of coconut I don't like
coconut water but I love like chocolate
and coconut together as one of my
all-time favorite combos so good
definitely suggest the Oreo coconut
thins they are delicious and all that
being said let's actually get into the
coconut scented items that I have here
I'm gonna start off with the makeup
items that I have and this first one was
a really big inspiration for this video
I've been using this in a project pan so
you guys have seen this I've talked
about this a lot on my channel this is
the Revlon kiss lip balm this is in the
scent tropical coconut and I love this
it's so great this is like the epitome
of like a pina colada
tropical coconut scent and I love it I
also love that this isn't too sweet on
the lips sometimes lip balms can be
overly sweet to me when it comes to you
like licking your lips and tasting it
and this one's like a really nice
balance of not being nothing but not
being like sickly sweet this retails I
believe for a $4.99 I think that's a
really fair price and I enjoy it a lot I
love the scent even Samms commented on
the scent when he's used it so this is
one of my all-time favorite products I
will say if
lips are like chapped and like done fork
this is not gonna bring you back from
the dead you're gonna need something a
lot more intense for that but this is
great if you just need a little bit of
hydration throughout the day on your
normal lips this will definitely work
and I highly suggest it and we all knew
it was coming the butter bronzer also
has the scent of coconut and it smells
really nice this is something that had
to grow on me I didn't like the scent of
this at first so many people raved about
it and we're talking about it and so
when I got it I just expected it to be
different for whatever reason but now
I'm used to it and I do really enjoy the
scent and this specific type of coconut
scent because there are different ones I
have used one of these uh bought a new
one and then I also have one in my
makeup kit so it's definitely a very
loved item I specifically have these
shade light bronze light bronzers what
it says on the back to see you guys know
I think there are two different ones I
kind of forget that a lot for me this is
like a subtle bronze I can't build it up
if I want to or be more light handed and
for me that's the thing that's important
with my bronzer because my goodness I
can just go for it a little too hard go
a little hard on the bronzer sometimes
and I find that this one usually always
looks good no matter how hard I go
highly suggest this this is a longtime
love in the community it's expensive but
it is worth it I think it's really great
moving on to some shower products I do
have a few of those I want to mention a
shampoo and conditioner these are the
organics weightless hydration coconut
water shampoo and conditioner I really
enjoy these I picked them up at the
grocery store because they were having
some type of deal and they were like
$5.99 plus something I don't know
there's something going on and I thought
it was a good deal so I picked it up and
I needed a shampoo and conditioner I
kind of lucked out that the coconut one
actually works for my hair type I have
very fine thin hair and this is like
weightless hydration so I thought it
would work for me but honestly I would
probably be super tempted to pick this
up even if it wasn't in the weightless
if it was just hydration I'd want the
coconut one because I love the scent so
much and I'm very happy because this is
one of my favorite shampoos that I've
used I have basically three favorites
right now the Moroccan oil volume
shampoo and conditioner is one of my
all-time favorites probably my number
one both of those products work for me
and I find
a lot of times with conditioners they're
just too heavy for my hair they wear my
hair down they make it greasy and the
Moroccan oil conditioner doesn't do that
this one doesn't do that and then the
other favorite that I have is the
melanin gets they have one that's like a
peppermint in cilantro Shampoo and
Conditioner situation I absolutely love
that one as well this falls in line very
similarly to those I feel like so if
you're looking for a cheaper alternative
and you have a very similar hair
situation to mine I think you would like
these these have just been so nice in my
shower I love the smell it's just a nice
experience and I think with it like
warming up here in LA and it turning
into spring and I'm just you know really
embracing the coconut tropical vibes
another shower product that I have is
from scent bird this was sent to me from
octoly and this is the nourishing sugar
scrub and coconut and sugar this was
actually the only option we had to pick
from but I was like super happy because
it was the only ones that I wanted out
of everything I actually have a full on
review of scent bird products that
aren't their perfumes I got sent a
candle some hand creams and this shower
scrub so if you want to know my thoughts
on those products from scent bird
because they are newer to their line I'm
gonna leave a video link down below but
this coconut scent is a bit different
than the rest of the coconut since here
it is a lot sweeter it's not your
traditional tropical coconut I still
enjoy it but it's definitely a little
bit different
I like this scrub a lot I think it works
really well it's nice and finally this
has a lot of grit to it and it doesn't
leave any type of oily residue which I
personally enjoy I don't like feeling
too oily and slippery after using a
scrub so I have been enjoying this this
scent is nice and it's just kind of been
a coconut explosion in my shower lately
the oddest product that I have when it
comes to coconut scented things is this
floss this is from Coco floss and it's
in the scent fresh coconuts I got this
sent to me from octoly too and I was so
excited because me and Sam I obviously
floss our teeth but I love coconut and I
just thought this was such a cool idea
this has a coconut scent when you like
take it out and you have it by your face
but this does not leave a coconut taste
in the mouth so definitely be aware of
that this is also a very expensive floss
this retails for eight dollars you can
get this on Sephora yeah it's a lot of
money
I asked him because we had just finished
another one of these up and I was like
would you purchase that it's $8 he was
like what No so these are not worth it
to Sam for me I do enjoy them this is a
very robust philosophy you're really
like you know getting it in there I feel
like it's doing a good job it's just it
is expensive but I do enjoy it even
though you don't have the coconut taste
it there's just something about it that
brings a little bit of joining in my
life so if I was ever at the place where
$8 on class wasn't a big deal I could
see myself purchasing this you aren't
getting any more product in this so it's
definitely expensive but I do I do enjoy
it I think it's nice but I totally
understand people not wanting to pay the
price for this and the last product that
I have to show you guys is a candle this
one is from Yankee Candle and it's in
the scent coconut beach I was gifted
this for my friend Liam I believe for
Christmas not this year but last year
and I finally got around to burning it
in my collection because I do have quite
a few candles but this is the only
coconut one that I have at the moment
this has a pretty nice scent throw I'm
actually kind of surprised because I
feel like I've used dankey candles
before and I didn't think that they were
very good that's why I always usually
stick to my bath and Bodyworks but I
have been enjoying this candle this
smells freakishly similar to Tiki Beach
if you're familiar with that one from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so I'm really excited
to burn this throughout the spring and
summer and have this scent in my house I
just I love candles that are coconut
scented and Beach scented they just make
me so so happy alright so now let's talk
about some products that I want to
purchase or that I'm interested in I'm
looking into they excite me whatever the
case may be I'm going to say up front
that a lot of these are freaking facial
sprays like miss I've just been so into
them and I feel like coconut is always a
really nice scent to when it comes to
them because it's refreshing and just
you know tropical and fun and they
usually are a good product for summer
and to beat the heat and all that so
let's just get into it I have two items
from the Sephora collection brand one of
them is a Sephora dry shampoo in the
coconut scent I have this on my love's
list and I'm pretty sure I'm going to
pick this one up
I believe it only retails for $8 and it
just makes me so
I love dry shampoo and I love coconut
and like combining the two I'm just
excited to see how it smells
I do use the batiste tropical and that's
one of my favorite scents from them but
there's just it's not my absolute
favorite smell like I enjoyed the most
out of everything that they have but
there's something about it sometimes
that I don't enjoy so I'm hoping this
one will be really nice and I can't wait
to try it out another product from the
Sephora collection is a face mist and
this is in the coconut scent as well it
retails for 750 it's not a ton of
product in there but I think it would be
nice to just try it out see if I like it
enjoy it and whatnot so those two are on
my list we'll just continue on with the
face sprays the next one I actually had
but I want to repurchase this is from
Too Faced it's The Hangover three-in-one
replenishing primer and setting spray I
really enjoyed using this I mean I used
it up quite fast compared to the other
sprays in my collection I will say the
coconut scent on this was not what I was
expecting I feel like this is like a
medical coconut scent I know that sounds
really weird but there's something about
this scent that just reminds me of like
medical and like sterile but then it
also has like coconut on it as well so
it took me a little bit to get used to
but I have really enjoyed it and I
actually miss it so it's just one that I
think it's nice it doesn't do anything
to really make my makeup stay longer I
can't honestly convince you of why this
product is good and I want to buy it I
just did I just enjoyed it so that is on
my list two more sprays this is one that
I hadn't heard of before but I was
looking on Malta's website and it's the
little Bart apothecary coconut and mint
cooling mineral mist they have two
different sizes ones a travel size for
ten dollars one is a larger size for I
believe 22 and I really want to try this
out coconuts one of my favorite signs
mint is another one of my favorite
scents so putting them together this
just sounds so refreshing and just
beautiful and I want to try it so so
freaking bad and the last spray that I
want to try out is from
too-cool-for-school I believe this is a
Korean skincare brand and this is their
coconut milky missed again it just
sounds so nice like I 100
these products because they have the
word coconut in the description of the
product and their facial miss like that
is why I want them they've sold me
already
this one is at a pretty good price point
as well it's $14 you can get it at
Sephora or Ulta and I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna pick this one up because of the
price point so we'll see how those work
out let me know if eventually you want
me to do like some type of face spray
video I might do a you decide when I buy
on facial setting miss next I don't know
anyway that is one that I'm definitely
looking into and then the last product
that I wanted to talk about that's
coconut scent it is from pin rose
perfumes I believe Sun st. is one of
their all-time bestsellers and this is
described as a dry coconut wood scent I
actually have been able to smell this
and it smells great so this is one that
I would just want in like a rollerball
or a small little fragrance spritzer I
don't necessarily want the full one at
least not yet maybe if I really loved
the rollerball but it's just one of
those ones that for summer or for
specific things that you're going out to
like the beach or the Sun or whatever I
think it would be so great and you guys
know that I'm traveling this summer so I
really want to collect some items that
have some great sense to them so I can
tie the memories of traveling and being
away with those scents you know so when
I come back I can use them and whatever
so that's one I'm thinking of maybe
doing that way but yeah those are all
the coconut sons that I'm interested in
the ones that I've tried everything
coconut again please leave any
suggestions for anything you think I
might like if you're a coconut lover let
me know down below and then just let you
guys know about the future of the series
some of the other categories for sense
that I'm thinking about our mint peach I
want to do one on fig I want to do a
unisex one I'll probably do just a
tropical one one that isn't just coconut
based like this had to have its own
category guys what else I think I want
to do a citrus one like there are just
so many so if you have any suggestions
of course leave those this is just like
a fun video I know it's a little bit
different but I've just had so many
amazing coconut scents around me lately
that I thought you know what I'm gonna
do a whole freaking video dedicated to
freaking coconuts and that's everything
that's this video guys thank you so so
much for watching and I will see you in
the next one
