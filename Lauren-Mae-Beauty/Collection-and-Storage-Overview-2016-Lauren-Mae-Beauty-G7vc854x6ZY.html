Lauren this is going to be my collection
and storage video I'm not gonna go
in-depth with everything that I own in
this video this is mostly just to show
you overall how I store my makeup and
special effects and brushes and
everything where I get ready in the
morning as well so I got a request to do
this video in like one big video I am
doing like a mini series on my channel
where I'm showing you in depth
different parts of my collection so for
whatever I have done so far I believe
those link down below so you can check
them out if there's anything you want to
see in depth that isn't down there and
that you want to see next definitely let
me know in the comments so that way I
can do that for you next sorry about the
dog still so to cut the dog off we're
just gonna get into the collection video
guys I'm gonna be doing it like more
vlog styles so if you want to see my
collection how I store it just keep
watching this is a little overview of
the top of my setup I do have the Alex
drawers I'll see if I can I have the
five drawers and I have two stacked on
top of each other this is where I store
most of my makeup we'll just go over the
top here first I'll zoom in a little bit
so starting off here this is just where
I keep my everyday brushes this is just
a mug I think I got from Marshalls it
says hello darling I thought it was cute
I keep all my palettes here that I'm
currently using obviously they're too
big to fit into this five drawer acrylic
holder I got this at Muji there's one
right here in Hollywood and that's where
I got this but this is where I keep my
everyday makeup things I use on the
daily all the time and I love it so
we'll go on top first this is my Beauty
Blender I got this little container at
Target and it does have like another
little one in it these are my powder
foundations I have like an au kabuki
brush although it wasn't originally this
is like a setting spray type of thing
that is a
hand sanitizer perfumes some foundations
that don't fit inside a brush cleaner at
glasses cleaner that's kind of just easy
access things on the top there in this
first drawer here this is all like my
base products so I keep like foundations
powders concealers primers that type of
stuff this one here is like bronzer
contour blush and brow products lots of
brow products for me and my eyeshadow
primer
honestly this drawer doesn't get used
much but this is like single shadows or
smaller eyeshadows that can actually fit
in the drawer but I've really been using
my palettes lately this drawer is
mascaras tools eyeliners glitter liners
anything I use more regularly in that
type of area and then the last drawer
here this is on my lip product so I
don't use lip products a ton but these
are the ones I tend to use the most
often or that I just like the most so
that's kind of the top here obviously I
have a mirror the thing in the corner
there that's actually my makeup chair I
just keep it there for safekeeping so
this is the first drawer this is kind of
again my base types of products so over
here I have like foundations BB creams
tinted moisturizers anything like that
all these L'Oreal ones in the back are
actually that I used to use in my kit
and I also use them mostly just for
airbrushing I'll just thin them out to
44 other than that the other ones are
just different random foundations and
tinted moisturizers and stuff in here I
have different powders um back here I
have cream foundations that I got with
my kit from school I keep these just an
incase type of thing but they're back
there this is primers so yeah any type
of face primer I have some setting
sprays back here and then in that back
corner that's like all just like random
cream products a lot of been nice stuff
that again I got in my kit for school or
was using in my kit for school but don't
necessarily use on an everyday for my
kit now more like special effects stuff
or just more specialized makeup in here
is where concealers go I only have one
in there I've been really good about
just using the concealer one at a time
so yeah that's my foundation drawer and
powders and primers and stuff this is
the second drawer down this is all
blushes so I have like mini like
palettes I can fit in this singles more
singles and then I have like a bigger
palette that I may
from like deep potted blushes as well as
like a different NARS palette I enjoy
this I really love blushes so I do have
quite a few the next drawer seems a
little bit bare but it's because I have
a lot of stuff in my kit right now too
so keep that in mind that if anything
seems a little bare it's probably
because I have it in my kit so these are
all my highlighters so I have quite a
few yeah I like to highlight these are
bronzers like it's looking bare because
I have like my contour kit and different
things in my kit and then these over
here are glitters I figured since this
was like highlighters and stuff I would
just put glitters here because it was
just a waste of space if not so I have
different glitters I have rhinestones
more glitters in the corner and then in
the back there are some stencils that
came with like this body glitter kit
that these came in I just got rid of the
rest of the kit and I just keep those in
case I wanted to do something fun or use
them as a reference or something so I
just have those in there as well and
then in the side I have the glue that
goes with the body glitter tattoos the
fourth drawer down is kind of a mix of a
lot of things so over here I have
mascara these are brow products these
are just like cream shadows back in the
back here these are just random like
cake liners from school and my kit but
the rest of this is just regular
eyeliners and chubby sticks in this
drawer I have just like smaller
eyeshadow palettes and singles and stuff
I have like eyelashes that I use for
myself back there more small eyeshadow
palettes these are like all my
Maybelline eye studio quads and then
more singles and pigments so I'm a color
pop singles and then the rest are all
pigments over there lots going on in
this drawer this next drawer is probably
my favorite because it's all my palette
so I have any palettes that can stand up
straight like a book I put like this
just because I'm running out of space
again I am missing a few palettes
because they are my kid I have like vice
and my Laura mega pros back there I have
some Cielo
the Kat Von D me vida loca these ones in
this corner besides these two are like
made palettes from like single shadows
and stuff Tarte shadows
yeah lots of palettes I'm a pallet girl
I loved palettes they're probably my
favorite thing to get hopefully this
isn't focused but this is kind of like
my last door it's
/ sad-looking this is all lip products
if you know me if you watch my channel
you know I'm not a lip product person
and I did just a pot a ton of my
lipsticks and put them into my kit so
that is why there is like barely
anything in here I'm kind of okay with
that I kind of want to like condense it
down a little bit and not make it look
like it's so empty but that's the state
of it now so this is just real life and
where it's at
it was kind of organized by like chubby
sticks glosses lip balms and tinted
balms liners and then this was like
lipsticks but again it's kind of crazy
right now
so those into the first six unit Alex
drawer this is into the second so the
first drawer of that one are all my
lashes lots of different lashes I hope
stuff's in focus it's kind of hard
because there's different layers and
stuff and I don't have automatic and
manual focus but I just have a ton of
different stuff in here eBay stuff
Ardell I have like different single
lashes in the corner as well so just a
bunch of lashes the next drawer I have
here are all things that are like
samples so I have samples in the left
corner then the rest of the products in
here are all things that I haven't
opened so either backups or things I've
got is like gratis or just some random
stuff I've got for free that I just
haven't busted into yet not necessarily
that I don't want to it's just that I
haven't and now I like to keep things as
fresh as possible that way if I don't
get to them I can pass them on and
someone else can enjoy them fresh and
new in the right hand corner I also have
some extra Beauty blenders just a lot of
like extra stuff that's like brand new
never been used
the next drawer is like completely
random I have all my perfume samples and
rollerballs and then I have just like a
random drawer of stuff a random box
filled with stuff so I have like Urban
Decay singles to put my singles in
because I have a palette for them and
just like random extras and then I have
some nail polish and nail care stuff on
the very left pretty basic drawer kind
of boring if you love nail polish you'll
probably love this next drawer this is
all my nail polish so I have like butter
LONDON at the China Glaze OPI I have
like my gels in the center there and
also a bunch of tools in them like
off-center so this is where
all of its days it's beautiful I wish
I'd used it more but yeah lotsa nail
polish so much nail polish
this next drawers were keep all my
makeup and perfume empties for the year
so on the very left hand side those are
all the makeup empties I've used up for
the year in the center ish I have my
perfume and body sprays that I've used
up and then on the very right are things
in a project currently that I have used
up so I just use this drawer as a way to
like organize my empties organize my
projects so yeah again kind of boring
unless you like project pants then you
would really like this door let me know
too if you want to see like a midway
point of my makeup empties for the year
and this last door here is where I keep
my empties that I'm going through for
the month and then I'll do my empties
video kind of boring I just did an
empties video so that's why there's
nothing in there and I forgot to put all
that makeup in that empties video so
next month will be super heavy on makeup
empties and then in the middle there and
those like candle jars are just like
perfumes and stuff that I don't want but
I don't really want to put an empties
video so I'm just waiting on someone to
come to my house and take them
essentially I know these last couple
drawers have been really boring so I
apologize but that's real life man
that's what my drawers actually look
like so let's get into my other drawer
and then we'll be done okay so the next
set of drawers that I have are actually
in my closet so we're looking at like
one half of my closet here the flow you
can see my clothes and this is another
of the alec shorts that this is the 9
drawer I believe so it could be like a
full shot of that so that's what that
looks like
as you can see if you're gonna look it
just at the very top up here I know my
fingers fuzzy I'm sorry but those are
all like special effects ash brush
cleaning things so I have like brush
cleaner 2:44
alcohol witch hazel isopropyl myristate
pros-aide I think even up there so
that's where I keep those types of
bottles because they will likely put
them on their side and it just works so
that's where those are but then let's
get into the main drawers of this one so
the first drawer here is super boring I
have just like random brushes which I'm
gonna do a brush to clutter and go
through these so that'll be good and
just random things these are things that
go in my kit I have a brush roll it's
like leg makeup I have the upper pains
these are like body paints and cake
foundations
really random stuff in there sorry for
another random ugly draw the next shirt
here are all tools that I use for
special effects stuff so I have a lot of
just like really cheap brushes I get
them at Michael's in a pack of 25 for
like $4.99 so I have a lot of those
types of brushes I have like a sea
sponge for texturing usually need to
clean and I also have popsicle sticks in
the back for laying hair the next drawer
here has more special effects stuff so I
have a ton of liquid latex this is a
huge thing of scar wax I have some
gelatin just in case something pops out
by blood more liquid latex and spirit
gum I have some like tear drop blower
things to make people cry and some
glycerin so just things I would need or
anything like that and here we have more
special effects so in the back here I
have some pros aid transfers underneath
that I have like tattoos and different
things that I've made for my like I've
made with tattoo paper and printed off
what I wanted I have some hair here this
is all crepe wool and then in here I
have some foam pieces so this is like a
little elf nose I think this is like
some devil horns and I have some bald
caps that I made from liquid latex in
school and there as well
underneath I have some tattoo paper and
stencils for like airbrushing yeah
another random drawer I know these seems
so pointless but I feel like this is
just real life like this is actually how
I live and also how I try to stay
organized with you know having so many
products so this is my hair drawer I did
not go to school for hair or anything
but a lot of the times I am booked as
hair and makeup so I like to just keep
just different things for hair so I have
a huge thing of a gel that I refill my
tiny bottle is I have lots of different
bobby pins I have some colored hair
things in case I want to do something
like editorial if I see stuff like that
I just pick it up so that way I have it
later
whatever you actually need that stuff
you're looking for you can never find it
and when you don't need it it's
everywhere so yeah and I also have some
wig caps in the back
now this next drawer is exciting no it's
not this is also boring so this is these
are a bunch of acrylic paints
use them to make my own packs pain if
you guys know anything about prosthetics
if you do like foam latex you have to
seal them and most of time you'd use
packs or just pros-aide but I don't want
to buy a bunch of packs I don't do a lot
of special effects stuff so I just have
a bunch of acrylic paint so I can make
my own packs and then in the back too I
also have some brown paper bag that uses
a trash bags I like to keep them in my
kit so that way no underwear I have to
set up I always have a little trash bag
to throw away sponges and spool ease and
different things that I use and then in
this drawer here these are all just like
empty containers so if I need to like
put gel like I talked about in one of
those I can do that or whatever so just
empty containers to do what I will with
the next door here has sponges and
basically dry goods is what I call it so
different types of sponges cotton rounds
anything like that I think that's mostly
what's in there right now so it's like
lots of sponges cotton balls these are
like some face scrubbers that I don't
use the next drawer here is like my
white goods instead of the dry goods so
I have like a million packs of white
because I'd love to buy a ton of them I
have some CVS like Cetaphil type lotion
I have hand sanitizers and then just
different wet wipes basically anything
I'm going to need in my kit that's what
that isn't going to like spill over like
the things on the top there I keep in
this drawer and I can just easily reach
from them and know when I need more or
whatnot and the last drawer to conclude
this whole collection and storage for
all my different makeup goods this is my
airbrush machine I don't necessarily
recommend it it's just one off of Amazon
it's fine I don't like to ear brush much
with it I definitely want to invest in a
different airbrush and then I also have
some temp2 colors airbrush colors down
there just like a really basic pack just
in case I need to do anything with them
so that's everything for this video hope
it wasn't too boring hope it gave you an
idea of my collection and that's
everything I hope you guys have a
wonderful day I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
