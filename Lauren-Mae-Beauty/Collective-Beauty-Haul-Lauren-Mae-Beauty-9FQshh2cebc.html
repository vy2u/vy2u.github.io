am going to be filming so many videos it
has been so difficult since moving to
find a time to film when there isn't
loud banging and people playing their
music it's been insane so i have a lot
of videos i want to film today I have so
many that have been stacking up so this
video is going to be a hall it's just a
collective haul I've picked up some
stuff from the drugstore my mom was
actually in town really recently as well
so when she came she got me some goodies
because she's a hairdresser so she gets
things from like cosmoprof act a really
good deal so she brought me some stuff
and then we went to a farmers market I
also bought some stuff from work so it's
kind of a mix of everything let's just
dive into it and I'll show you what I
got recently and I did pay for all the
stuff this isn't any gratis from work or
anything it's all stuff that either
myself or my mom paid for so just saying
I'll start with drug store stuff and
i'll start with makeup too so i got two
of the wet'n'wild palettes these I
believe are this silver light collection
I'm pretty sure that's what they're from
I really wanted this one this is
California roll these two colors this
like peach and this like red matte color
I just had to have even though i'm sure
i have dupes of these I just wanted them
really bad so I got this and then it was
buy one get one half off so i got the
embrace obscurity six pan palette as
well this one has to matts in it and
then the roster shimmering i thought
this would be nice have been really into
like these types of purples and blues
especially my brows so i thought i could
get use out of this one out of all of
them the most so i picked up those 2 i'm
pretty sure you can't get them anymore
so i apologize i got them a little bit
ago more recently from the drugstore i
got this super skin no super stay better
skin concealer and corrector from
maybelline they also came out with a
foundation from this line i have been
breaking out quite a bit since moving
here and i thought this would be really
nice to use some of my stuff is healing
like my i have like acne scars that are
healing and i thought this could help
with correcting them as well as
concealing them so i wanted to get it
for that plus i really like
liquid concealers I have like a doe foot
applicator like this so I thought this
would be something I could try out i
love the maybelline fit me also the
dream lumi so I thought I'd like this
and then the last thing from the
drugstore that I got this is a l'oreal
lalak lip like pencil these came out
like limited edition I believe like a
year maybe two years ago and they
brought out a new ones I don't know if
those ones are limited edition but this
one is in I wish I could tell you oh
here it is choco lack and this is a
lacquer one so it's not a matte finish
it's like a glossy finish I like this
one I'll give you guys a swatch of the
color that's the color there I think
it's nice I am I have noticed it's
Jane's differently than what it looks
like so when I put this on my lips and
after it wears off the stain is a little
bit more of like a brighter pink but
overall I do like this product it
probably won't pick up more because I
wasn't into the colors but I don't
regret this one so I picked up that so
the next couple of items i actually
bought at work and i held off so long
working in a beauty store it's really
difficult not to like buy everything and
go insane but i finally caved i got a
couple things only three things i'm
really proud of myself but um these are
things that i got from work so we carry
steal at work so i got one of the aqua
blue watercolor blushes this one's in
the color rose water i haven't even
opened this since i got it so yeah
that's what it looks like it's kind of
like the tart loose powder foundation
with like that mesh cover so the product
doesn't go everywhere that's a swatch of
it i did share it out a little bit but
it's just such a beautiful color i did
not need a cream blush but I just
couldn't read this these I think that
limited edition with their summer
collection so I wanted to get one before
it went away I get thirty percent off at
work so i got this thirty percent off
and i'm excited to use it but i need to
use about least one cream blush it's
nice it's so pretty if you are
indicating blushes i would definitely
check these out i also got an Anasazi or
product this is the brow was in the
color taupe I ran out of this product
and I went without it for a little bit
and I'm so glad it is back
my life it's such a great pencil I love
the spool even though this I just don't
this boy let me show you this bully
that's the spoolie on it I absolutely
love it it's just such a good product
and it's something that I'll probably
always have in my collection and I'm
glad everybody those are all the makeup
items this item still for my work but I
have no more like cosmetics this is
malicious that's really her say this is
from the brand alicious that's better
this is the brown sugar vanilla
extraordinary whipped sugar scrub this
thing is absolutely divine I'm not
someone who loves like a lotion II feel
I don't like lotion I don't like to feel
greasy at all but this body scrub that's
what this is that's what it looks like
it's like a whipped consistency it feels
so nice on the skin this scent I'm not
usually into bakery sense this is brown
sugar it smells like you're baking
Christmas cookies in your shower it's
absolutely divine I just love this
product it leaves such a nice I don't
assume residue but like oily residue on
your legs I put this on i scrub my legs
and then i'll shave with the residue
left and then I still wash my body like
after that in my legs and it still
leaves a nice moisturised feeling on my
legs I absolutely love this if you or
someone who is totally fine with like
the feeling of moisturization and oils
and lotions you will love this even
probably more than me I'm just in love
this is expensive it's like $35 but i
don't know i really like it it's
definitely a luxury item but i think
it's kind of worth it I love it I really
do love this product now on to the
things my mom brought me she brought me
a bunch of hair stuff so I got trained
by pureology and they didn't bring us
like gratis or anything but just the way
they trained me on the line I was super
interested my mom has had me use
pureology in the past when I was younger
but now that I'm older and like can make
my own decisions and all that I was
super interested in tronic pureology so
I had her pick me up some stuff from
saloncentric I went with the strength
cure line this line is like great for
people with extensions or like anyone
really trying to
other hair out or have like a lot of
breakage this is going to help like
strengthen the hair and you can grow
that hair out then I got the shampoo and
the conditioner now with pureology these
look like small bottles and they're
expensive we sell them at work for I
think 32 50 each like this is 30 to 50
this is 30 to 50 crazy but this is a
very concentrated product so um I don't
know if you guys can see the little
symbol up here but when you're using
this product you should not use more
than this like dollop right here on your
hair / wash and there should be about 71
washes in each of these bottles so not
that that justifies the price but at
least you are getting more than I feel
like what you it looks like you're
getting in these bottles silver I have a
like to this this brand is safer color
treated hair they claim that it's
sulfate free although I believe they do
use like a buffer sulfate yeah they do
use like a buffer sulfate because I
believe that formula to change but
anyway I've been enjoying this I just
don't like the smell that's the only
thing I wish it had that minty smell I
believe like the hydrating one does but
this one doesn't it's kind of a weird
smell but i like it so far it's good and
then along with those products i also
got the strength cure fabulous like
treatment this is kind of like a product
you put in your hair when it's damp
after the shower again it's just
supposed to help lengthen your hair keep
it strong keep it from breaking kind of
think of it like a serum but for your
hair those are the items i had forget me
from pureology I still want like the
clarifying shampoo to use about like
once a week or so I also want to try
their dry shampoo and they're dry
conditioner I want to try their saltless
like sea spray I want to try a lot of
their products so you should not be
surprised if you see me get more of
their things and then my mom also picked
me up a moroccan oil she got this for me
because i'm like halfway done with mine
I use it every time I get out of the
shower and I just don't want to be
without it and i don't know if i'll run
out before i see her again and i
definitely don't want to pay like
40-something dollars for this so she
also got me moroccan wow so thanks mama
Thanks and then the last thing for my
hall I got at a farmers market since I
moved there's a farmers market really
really close to me every single Sunday
morning they like close to straight down
it's really awesome it's just cool that
it's like a permanent part of where I
live it's not just like on a random
Sunday it's every single Sunday band I
got a bar of soap this is the lavender
eucalyptus it smells so good oh it
smells so nice i'm excited to use this
it's Karen's beautiful soap it's just a
local woman who makes these soaps and
sells them at the farmers market and
these are handmade it has coconut oil
palm oil safflower oil and purified
water lots of like moisturizing things
there's no alcohol or animal fat or
petroleum products in here so um I'm
really excited to use this I think it's
going to be very moisturizing soap not
one that's going to make you feel like
super squeaky clean and like dry but
still clean more clean and moisturize
than clean and squeaky and dry so those
are all the things that I have recently
gotten it's kind of a collective haul so
I didn't buy all these things at the
same time it's been since basically my
last makeup haul or anything these are
what I bought I have just bought some
stuff from Sephora because I could not
read this so i'll probably be putting up
a mini haul from just like the stuff I
got from Sephora but anyway that is
everything for this video let me know if
you guys have any questions if you want
reviews venue of the stuff if you love
any of the stuff down below in the
comments and I will see you in the next
video bye guys I hope you're having a
wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
