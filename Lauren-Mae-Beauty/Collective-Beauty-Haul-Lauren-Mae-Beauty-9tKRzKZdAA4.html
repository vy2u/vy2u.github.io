Lauren this is going to be a collective
beauty haul I have been collecting a lot
of this stuff for a while so it's kind
of a lot I definitely suggest like you
know save some time for this video get a
drink get a snack because it's a lot of
stuff since I've had some of this stuff
for a little bit of time if I can give a
review on it I will some of the stuff
I've had but I've been saving for other
videos some of it is just stuff for my
kid I did go shopping today and I
included that stuff in here I wasn't
going to but I thought some of you guys
are interested in things that I by just
for my kid or for clients or things that
aren't like consumer beauty or ask
consumer beauty I guess anyway I'm just
gonna stop there and let's get into all
the stuff i have here in front of me I
have so many products in front of me
I'll start off with the stuff I got when
my mom was in town that by no means is
the first stuff that I got in here but I
don't know we're gonna just start there
so since I get a pro discount at all of
the stores here in LA my mom always
wants to hit up name EES and Nigel's and
all these stores when she's in town so
when I was with her I got sucked into a
couple of things because of her one of
the counters we looked at was Laura
Mercier I got some things I wasn't
expecting to get so i guess first I got
to perfumes but one was in a set so i'll
save that next this one here is the
fresh fig sent from Laura Mercier this
is a 1.7 ounce bottle I believe these
retail for $55 but I get forty percent
off Laura Mercier this smells really
really good for my scent bird i got a
fig fragrance as well this one is
different this is sweeter but it still
has that fig annette i like both of them
i don't think i could pick one the other
one's definitely more unisex this one's
a little sweeter so I feel like it is
more feminine I really like this it
smells so good obviously I've been using
it and i really suggest checking out the
different fragrances I didn't even know
Laura Mercier made fragrances before me
and my mom are in there so I definitely
suggest just giving them a whiff I don't
think that they're insanely expensive
they could be more is what I'm saying
but again that just can't really seals
the deal for me and the other thing that
I got from Laura Mercier was actually
like a holiday kit it retails for I
think $58 and you get three products so
these are two of them
um everything in the set was in the
scent tea mint citron it smells so good
it's like a green tea mint scent it
smells just divine I love this scent so
much I don't know if it's limited
edition or holiday or if it's regular
but it is so good if you are by a
counter or in sephora smell this scent
it's also so good so anyway it came with
the body butter which i wouldn'ta bought
on its own but the set again was fifty
eight dollars and the fragrance alone is
55 so I just figured might as well get
the extras so I got the body butter the
1.7 ounce fluid perfume as well as a
cream body a body shower cream I don't
really know it says cream body cleanse
this almost looks like a lotion when you
put on your loofah it's not my favorite
you can buy this separate I believe but
I would not I've been using it and it's
just like okay I don't really like it I
love the licious way over this and then
other than that I just got two sets from
lorac when I was with my mom these were
two sets i was looking at again i get
forty percent off lorac so with it being
a set on top of my discount it's just an
amazing deal i did get these six lip
gloss set you can get that at Ulta I
believe again it retails for $25 else
watch these for you but I got these all
for Mike it if it's 25 that means i got
it for about what 12 plus 3 i got these
for like fifteen dollars i think that's
an amazing deal less than five dollars a
piece wait what lesson like three
dollars piece what am I talking about
you can't beat that I can't beat that at
the drugstore these looks super pretty
and my kid and there's a lot of
different varieties so i'm also watching
these really fast i'm just going to
sanitize the back of my hand with some
alcohol so i'll show you them just
watched here this one's called ballerina
the shade next to that is called
connoisseur the lightest shade is angel
and its really pretty nude with like a
golden almost duochrome shimmer in it
it's really subtle it's really pretty
the pink is called beauty queen the dark
berry wine color is called provocateur
and then the red one here is called
celebrity so they're obviously super
pigmented I really enjoy these and I'm
really happy to have them in my kid I
just can't beat the price for all the
variety
and the fact that they're high in
products these also smell nice too they
smell like a mac lipstick just that like
vanilla scent let me know if you like
swatches in halls or if you don't I just
thought I'd be a little bit more like
helpful if you wanted to see what the
colors look like if you wanted to buy it
then just being like I have these so but
i'll try to hurry it up i don't know i
showed you this watch hand with nothing
on it and then the other said that I
wanted to get from lorac was there lorac
Pro matte lip sticks I don't know I've
had quite a few of these in the past I
think they are a really good price
without the forty percent off there are
eighteen dollars and i believe the kit
with three of them in it came out too I
think it was 18 and then off or maybe 20
and then I discount so I thought it was
a good deal i thought i would pick up
these colors i will say that the colors
on the end or not the colors that are in
the watch or in the actual products
that's a little disappointing i do still
like them but i wish they were more
these colors than what they are so the
first one i have here is the color
autumn and it is a warm nude shade and
just to give you reference like that's
it there this one probably matches the
most out of all of them but i feel like
it is more warm than you would expect
the pink ones in Italian rose and it's
just way brighter I feel like then what
the end looks like and what a fall lip
would be again I'm not like completely
upset I just think it's a little
misleading and the last one here this is
in the color burgundy wine it's a pretty
color I'm wearing this in a vlog that
hopefully I'll have posted if not i'll
post soon but um that's it there see how
different that is that's way different
so these are just for my personal use I
just you guys know how I like pen style
lipsticks like this so I thought with
the deal and I just was having fun with
my mom I pick those up I think I
actually got one more thing with my mom
this is the beauty blender cleanser this
is my absolute favorite thing to clean
the beauty blender with I know a lot of
people use different things but I find
that I can get all my stains out with
this and that is really important for me
because I do use Beauty blenders in my
kit and I want them to look pristine
absolutely completely a hundred percent
clean and this does that and I just
than having a Beauty Blender that's not
staying so i love this i will repurchase
for forever i use it for myself it's so
good it just like liquefies all the
product it's amazing I'm gonna show you
some stuff that I actually got from
anastacio now this was not like given to
me in PR but my husband works in a hotel
he does audio-visual in hotels and
honest asya does their conference there
I think they do him like once every
quarter so you got me some products last
time they were there and so he kind of
knows the girls there he was able to get
me the hook up they are so sweet to give
me this because they usually don't but
because he's a cool dude I got the hook
up so I'm just gonna show you some of
the products they gave me basically
their whole like fall line but yeah how
cool is that I was like I was so
ecstatic Sam got home before me and then
had to go leave I think to do improv or
something and so when I got home and he
wasn't here he hit it so that I couldn't
find it because he wanted to be here
when I opened it I was like looking
around like it was Christmas like
shaking boxes trying to find it but it
was super awesome anyway I got two of
the glow kits so this is the sweets glow
kid it's really pretty you guys know how
much I like the other glow kits I did
get those from the conference last time
but really pretty colors probably not
something I would have purchased like I
wanted to buy it just to have it but i'm
glad i got it for free for sure my
favorite colors are definitely
marshmallow and sassy grape I could do
without these but it's really cool
nonetheless the one that I was so
excited about was the Anasazi a
moonchild glow kid I was so wanting this
and I was gonna purchase it and I was
just so ecstatic that they happened to
put this in there as well so this is the
one that has like the duochrome colors
totally up my style totally up my style
at my alley my style really enjoy this I
don't think it's a must-have for
everyone I think if you like to do more
out there looks or if you don't have a
lot of dual Chrome's you could use these
as I shadows too there is some glitter
in him I wish that the glitter was not
in there cuz i just don't like glitter i
wish it was just a really pretty sheen
but i really do like this if you were
interested in it it is really cool so
excited about that and i have been
playing around with him i will say they
did give me honest
the modern renaissance palette I did
actually just send that to Sarah here on
YouTube she had mentioned in a comment
that she wanted it and you know like was
seeing about getting it so I just sent
it to her because I didn't need two of
them I love it but I don't need like a
backup of it another thing that I got in
that package was the hydrating oil I
honestly didn't know why Nastasia had
anything like this so I have this in my
kit I didn't have an oil in my kid and
it's really nice i like to use on
clients who are really really dry i will
either use this by itself and let it
sink in and then like do their hair or i
will mix this with a moisturizer if they
don't need that much but it's also nice
just if i wanted to do a more glowy look
or anything so i'm glad to have this in
there it smells really nice to vary
herbal yeah it's very nice like
aromatherapy kind of smell so I find
that my clients really like when i use
this they like mention the smell and how
it smells good and then kind of the last
big thing that was in that kit oh my
gosh okay and the last kind of big thing
that was in that kid was the fall lip
gloss mini set so this comes with 56 the
alchemist it I again have these in my
kit I'm gonna swatch them and show you
them but these are also very pigmented I
know a lot of people really like these
glosses I will say my favorite one is
the color raisin I think that's like a
fan favorite so let's do this the first
one on this side is the color maple this
is a really pretty brownish red with
shimmer in it the only one that has
shimmer the one next to that the red is
called Carla really pretty the one next
to that is called raisin and that one is
probably the most popular one out of all
of them really like this color the warm
nude shade is called Amber the color rum
is next it's kind of like a brownie nude
and then the last shade here is called
Barry and that's probably my second
favorite I really like that one so these
are really pigmented I feel like they're
very similar honestly to the lorac ones
so if you're wanting to save a little
money these have a different smell these
have more like a bakery sent they remind
me of the next butter glosses than the
way they smell and they're just so
pigmented it's almost like a lacquer and
they're not overly like sticky or shiny
they just give an well they're really
shiny but not like in a sticky gross way
if that makes sense I feel like these
are really nice
gettin glad to have them than I get the
other stuff I got in that package was
like I got an actual bag with like
tweezers and scissors and a mirror and a
little booklet and just different things
but I'm not gonna show you those because
it's boring so let's move on I got some
stuff recently at target for some first
impression videos something I was
wanting to do was a Maybelline 5 first
impressions kind of like I did with the
hard candy so I picked up five things
I've never tried from them one of them
was the blush nudes palette now I have
heard I wouldn't even say mixed reviews
i would say mostly negative reviews but
i wanted to try this out for myself I
don't try a lot of drug store stuff out
so I'm kind of excited for this to see
how it is I don't know if it's gonna be
good but I kind of tried to pick a look
out I got two of the better skin items
this is the better skin foundation in
the color ivory I believe this is the
second two lightest shade I was super
scared after the hard candy one to go
with the lightest shade so hopefully
this will work for me and then I also
picked up the powder this is in the
color 10 porcelain I did get the
lightest shade in this one just in case
this was too dark and also for setting
under my eyes and stuff so I am excited
to try this I've heard really good
reviews and my fourth item from
Maybelline is the master prime
long-lasting eyeshadow base and I don't
have any more primers I'm running out so
I thought this would be good and
actually useful in my collection to see
if it holds up and the last thing I got
here this is one of the bold lip sticks
and this is in the color sapphire siren
I normally don't go with lipstick tubes
like this but I thought this would be a
really pretty fun look I hadn't watched
it before now but that's what it looks
like so I'm excited to do really like a
bold lip with the stuff I got and I'm
excited to finally film this video I
picked up two other foundations while I
was at target this is the Milani conceal
and perfect two on one foundation and
concealer in creamy vanilla it is the
lightest shade I have used this one time
I just I couldn't resist but I still
want to do a first impression on it
though so I will not use it anymore
until we do that video and then the
other one I picked up was e sonia kashuk
soft-focus satin matte foundation I
haven't really tried that much from
sonia kashuk so i am excited to try to
see how it works I'm just I've been in
the mood to try the foundation so I
really like to actually like get on this
and do the first impression so I can try
these two kind of random things before
we get into the things I bought today
these are both from Daiso died so is
like a Japanese dollar store here in
California I don't know if there are
other places I think they are but
everything in them is a dollar fifty so
I picked up two foundations because
again i thought i'd be fun to just try
some lower end foundations and see how
they hold up so they're both from santee
or Sam hey I don't know how to say it
this one here is the Aqua stylish silky
Milk foundation in number one and this
is the magic skin beautify our CC cream
in number one as well so I want to see
how these work if they oxidize what the
coverage is like and kind of what you
can get for a dollar fifty there I just
thought it'd be fun to add to my first
impressions and they're like way cheaper
than any of the other foundations
combined so now on to the things I got
today I'm filming this and it is friday
and halloween is monday so i do have a
couple clients and doing tomorrow for a
party and they want to do like a day of
the dead skull for the guy and then
she's gonna be kind of like a corpse
bride like an undead bride type of thing
so i wanted to get some paints these are
wolf-like crane paints what are they
these are wolf hydra color paints and
these are perfect for body painting why
wolf is like especially good as cuz
they're wack space so when you activate
these with water as they dry and as you
wear them throughout the day they have a
little bit more gift to them they're not
going to crack on the face wat Dee blue
color I got this like greenish color wow
that looks so blue on camera but it's
more grain in person I got kind of like
a gray blue color and then I also picked
up a white I did pick up black because I
have the Kryolan aqua paint in black I
have them in white too but they only had
like a really big black one and I just
didn't want to pay twenty dollars for it
so I'm excited to have these just in my
kit and also just like in my collection
having a body paint and a water
activated paint that actually works
actually looks opaque and just does what
you needed to do on the first try makes
doing creative gigs like that just so
much easier and so much more fun because
your products are just working for you
yeah I'm really excited to have these if
you're looking for really good body
paints though snazaroo has pretty dang
nice one
and you can get those I believe at
Michael's I got a couple from the
clearance section a while ago but those
ones are really good too I needed to
pick up lashes I feel like I'm always
picking up lashes these are the demi
wispies they're like some of my favorite
lashes to use and then I also just
picked up some fun ones for the kind of
bride doll makeup so these are really
spiky doll type of lashes I just went
and got a couple different ones I
thought I could just keep in my kit
whichever one she likes better or that I
decide a lot of the times they're just
like do whatever you want just really
nice and spiky different ones and I
might use some of these four bottom
lashes as well two more things guys and
then the haul will be over this is the
Mario Badescu drying lotion I got this
for me and Sam just because it's nice to
have a spot treatment and we don't have
one right now we ran out of our Murad
one in last I did get a white pencil
this one I think has like a sheen to it
but I just needed a white pencil so i
can map out how I'm gonna do the face
and stuff so i am gonna be doing a
practice run on Sam tonight so i might
film that i'm not sure if i want to if I
just want to like do it but yeah I like
practicing before I do gigs just to feel
comfortable and confident myself and
just to work out any kinks you never
know what can go wrong and it's just
nice to go into a gig like ask for
parish possibly can anyway I got this
white pencil just to map things out oh
my gosh that's my collective haul guys I
know as a lot of stuff thanks for
sticking through if you're still
watching I will have everything listed
down below in case you were interested
in anything that I showed here and I
will see you in my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
