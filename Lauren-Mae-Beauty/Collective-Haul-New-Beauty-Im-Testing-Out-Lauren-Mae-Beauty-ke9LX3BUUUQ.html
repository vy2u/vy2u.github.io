learn thank you so much for watching
today we have a haul video I haven't
done a video haul in about two months so
I thought I would show you all of the
new things that are in my collection so
that you guys can let me know what you
want to see videos on I have picked up a
few things recently and I also have a
few things from PR so this is collective
I didn't get this all at one time
but I thought I would show you guys what
I've picked up because it's fun to see
new makeup and honestly so much has
launched lately I think it's interesting
to see what people pick out of all of
this stuff it's launched if a whole
video is gonna like trigger you into
buying stuff don't watch this please I
will have an anti haul video up next
tomorrow so definitely stay tuned for
that and other than that let's just get
into it
I'm gonna start off with all of the
things that I've bought personally so
first I'm gonna start off with color pop
if you follow me on Instagram and you
saw me post a picture of this palette as
well as another palette I will be
showing this is the I think I love you
palette from colour-pop sorry if I'm
blinding you this is their third
installment of these little palettes I
have all three of them I will be doing a
review and like comparison video with
those other palettes as well and also
with other color pop shadows that I have
in the pressed version I think these are
an amazing deal they're $16 they come
with 12 different shadows and although
color story wise this kind of bronzy
gold wasn't the most interesting I did
like that they changed that the
packaging and I wanted to compare it to
the other ones that I had because I do
really like the color pop formula so a
video on this will be coming if you want
to see like tutorials or like get ready
with me or whatever with this palette
just let me know
with that palette I did pick up enough
items so that if you get free shipping
which is 35 for me in California so I
decided to pick up one of their brushes
this one is the OH
they don't put it on there I think it's
like the tapered blending brush I
thought this looked really similar to my
absolute favorite the e-40 from sigma so
i thought i would try this out obviously
I haven't used it I just keep forgetting
to pull it out so I will be using this
and coming back to you I do a series on
my channel called Holland retrospect so
I will be showing all of these items
again hopefully in like two or three
weeks and I will let you know
my thoughts are on these items if it's
changed if it hasn't especially for the
ones that I haven't even tried yet I
will get it back to you and let you know
what I think I don't know why but I
forgot two of the colour-pop items so
I'm gonna go pick this up :
it took me entirely too long to find
these items but anyway next is a shadow
from colour-pop I just picked up one
surprisingly this is the color saltwater
this was from I believe their summer
2017 collection and I really liked the
shadows from it so I wanted to pick this
one up do I need this definitely not but
it's the one I picked up it's just a
orange bronze gold color it's just warm
it's very caramel II caramely however
you want to say that it's nice quality
but it's not like my favorite I don't
necessarily think it's that that amazing
if you were to pick up just like a
single shadow I really like the color
high-strung anyway moving on to the last
item from colour-pop I did pick up one
of their new brow pencils in one of my
new Beauty launches video I'll leave it
linked I did mention that I was
interested in these they did have Robins
as before but these are a new formula
and I got the color blonde they do not
have a color taupe so this was like the
only option I had this has a nice little
spoolie
it also has a really nice fine tip and
something I love about this is that you
can retract it which the other color pop
brow pencil you could not do so that is
a great improvement the formula on this
is a lot harder and stiffer than the
original formula so it definitely is
more similar to the Anasazi ones or the
NYX one so I do wish there was an
extended shade range because blonde is
quite light but it is nice if I want to
just fill in like the inner portion of
my eyebrows more than anything I just
want to try this out I love my elf brow
pencil that one's like my number one
holy grail but this one is really nice
and I probably would pick this one up
again too so it was still a 1 and now my
battery is dying it's taking me all day
to film this my goodness you guys don't
care about that though and we're back
again moving on I'm going to talk about
some things I picked up from Sephora
again I did purchase these items so I
don't know why I didn't start off with
this one but this is the Natasha de Nona
Leela palette did I say it right guys
did I do it please I don't know why
so hard for me you don't even know okay
for me I want to say like instead of is
it a pint of beer I want to say a pinch
of beer because it looks like mint and
it sounds cute like I'll just have a
little pinch so hopefully that gives you
a little insight into me and how I can't
pronounce anything if for whatever
reason you haven't seen the inside of
this this is what it looks like I will
be doing a let's do pit on this palette
I also will be doing a review and
tutorials like just let me know what you
guys want to see with this this is my
first Natasha Jinnah palette I've been
wanting to try the formula for a really
long time but as you guys know this is
hella expensive so it just took a long
time I really like the palettes in this
format and this size it's still really
expensive but it's not nearly as
expensive as the big like green blue and
purple brown or whatever those other
palettes are I'm gonna save my thoughts
on this palette for a future video but
definitely let me know what you guys
want to see with this so I can make sure
to do it because I know this is a super
expensive palette and I want you guys
have as much information on it as
possible before you purchase it's also
permanent so don't feel like you need to
like run out and get it you don't it'll
be there forever alright
also from Sephora I did pick up the
Stila mini written in the stars glitter
and glow liquid eyeshadow set I decided
to just pick up the 3-pack they do have
a six pack that came out and I was going
back and forth and at one point I was
like I'm just gonna get both of them but
I decided to be good and also just like
really think about what I want and the
way I use glitters is mostly on the lid
and I usually want something that's a
little bit lighter and like gonna
brighten up the lid instead of something
dark and smoky so I figured I would get
the most use out of these shades I guess
I'll take it out of the packaging I do
have a full-size one of these in the
shade the digital diamond der diamond
does I think I'm talking about Drake
right there right it doesn't have a song
called digital diamond anyway I do have
this in the full-size but it's in my kit
so this one I'm going to keep for myself
and then that set also came with this
one doesn't have it on the bottom cool I
don't know why this one doesn't have it
on the bottom but this one is kitten
karma and then
smokey storm so I think these are all
permanent which is cool with me I just
like that they're in a smaller size
because I don't do glitter all the time
so it's just nice to get them on a deal
and be able to try out different colors
without spending all of the money on
them I'm super happy with these again
they do look really tiny they're pretty
small but for how often you're gonna use
these I really do think it's a good deal
and I'm really happy I pick them up but
I'm really happy I only picked up the
three I don't think I need the other one
I don't need anything but you know a toy
things from Sephora this next one was a
purchase inspired by LS I will leave her
a swatch video of this because she did a
good job like wearing them all and stuff
it's the nude artists box and it's the
creators palette so they got six
different creators and like influencers
to come up with their own shade and put
it in here but anyway it comes with
those six shades and then it also has a
sharpener I really love nude Stix I have
quite a few of their pencils but I don't
really have too many of the magnetic
ones these are a matte lip pencil that
turns into a liquid lipstick on your
lips so you get to apply it like you
would a traditional lipstick in a pencil
form but it has the lasting power and
staying power of a liquid lipstick which
is awesome I am NOT someone who is very
good at drawing on their lip line but
something that I definitely need to
practice more with myself I'm into very
like natural lips and low-maintenance
lips most of the time but I thought that
these colors were just so beautiful that
I would check them out but I'm really
excited to try these out I think this
set is perfect for fall there are some
really nice nudes but they're a little
bit more muted and then there are some
deeper colors as well I don't know why a
lot of people don't talk about nan
sticks I really wish they got a little
bit more recognition but I know I'm
excited for this set and I'm happy it's
kind of expensive this was like fifty
six dollars and all of the nude sticks
that I've gotten in the past I was lucky
enough to get for gratis when I used to
work at my old beauty store um so this
is my first like nude sticks purchase
purchase and the last thing that I
purchased from Sephora was this efendi
Beauty lip gloss this is the only one
they have it's in the color Fenty glow
I'm wearing it on my lips today it's the
only thing I'm wearing
with this lipgloss I love this product
so much I was talking about and I get
ready with me how you know I wasn't sure
about some of the products just for me
specifically because I I don't know I'm
not like a really big highlighter girl
this is a little bit more I don't know
pink look I really wanted that flushed
and I have some pink on the nose and
stuff and I have a lot of highlighter on
but normally in my everyday life I'm not
a very glittery highlighting type of
girl so the highlighter didn't work I
like more dewy skin so the foundation
wasn't gonna work for me like it was
just disappointing if I wanted so much
to get stuff and support it but I just
wasn't feeling it but then I saw this
and I was seeing swatches and people
wearing it and I was like that's the lip
gloss for me like that's that's it this
is the product I'm getting from this
collection in this launch it's so good
the smell of this is like a fruity
cupcake I love it so much it kind of
reminds me of you my video is done
rendering let's export it this is like
the most interrupted video I've ever
made but anyway this is just such a
beautiful lip gloss oh I was saying what
it smelt like it smells like the Revlon
HD lipsticks if you've ever smelt those
it's kind of like tropical but this has
a bit more of like a vanilla scent to it
too it's not sticky on the lips it's
just beautiful I love the packaging
everything about this is a win it's like
my new favorite gloss ever glosses are
coming back people and I'm so excited if
you're someone who likes an easy gloss
highly suggest checking this one out if
you're in Sephora it's just so good I do
like this more than my bare minerals Gen
nude so so good so happy I picked it up
I do have a few deluxe sized samples
that I picked up with this order so I
thought I would mention them the first
one is the fancy Beauty Pro filter
foundation I have the shade 150 if you
want to see what this looks like on me I
believe might get ready with me link
down below I did use it there I'm still
using
and trying to figure out what I think I
probably won't purchase the full size
though so I don't think it's bad it's
just not quite what I want right now and
to invest the money in it even though I
will say I think it's $34 which is a
pretty good price for high-end
it's probably not something I'm gonna
buy I had another deluxe size sample
this is the bareMinerals bear Pro
Foundation and this is the color dawn
0-2 I've heard a lot about this and when
I saw it as an option for a sample I
wanted to try it out because I am
looking for a foundation that I'm really
gonna like and I want to try out some
new things and these are perfect sizes
to get more than like one or two wares
out of it but again you don't have to
like buy the full size and invest money
which I like and you laughs select size
sample this is the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye cream this is supposed to
smooth bright and end to puff I've used
it a couple times it is nice it's
definitely a bit thicker so it's good
for like night time or if you have you
know more aged skin or need more
moisture under your eyes this probably
would be nice for you I will get back to
you though with like more use on it
alright I think that is everything that
I purchased so from here on out this is
all stuff that's been sent to me for PR
I did not purchase this with my own
money so first I want to talk about some
things that influencer sent me these are
all from ciate London and I have three
different products here I was so excited
when I got the notification that I was
going to be in this box because it's
makeup and I love makeup Samsung Sam is
now home and so we're still gonna
continue this is the fourth interruption
in case you were counting anyway I'm
just gonna move on to the first ciate
London item this is the dewy Stix and I
was excited to try this out I did use it
today but this is definitely a product I
need you try a million times to figure
out how to make it work it's really
pretty it gives you that really dewy
look to the skin like you're wearing
Vaseline or something like that so it's
like a product I almost feel like you
shouldn't top with something else I
think it would look really good on bare
skin or just over a really light
foundation but when you start mixing in
powders and stuff like that
I feel like this either just completely
gets lost and you don't see it or it's
like adding weird texture to the skin so
I definitely need to play around with
this and at this point I don't think
that this is a product for everyone
so it's just not very commercial and
it's definitely not gonna be a big part
of everyone's like makeup routine that
box came with three items so the next
one is this fierce flicks it's just a
pen liner this is nice
it looks like the steel one it looks
like you know it's nice it's black I
haven't tried it on the ayat so I don't
know about stinging power especially on
the inner corner or what not throughout
the day a little bit like it bled on my
hand really bad right now anyway I need
to try it out but you guys know I'm not
someone who wears liquid liner like
every single day it's not a part of my
everyday routine lord help me to get
through this video I hope you guys can't
hear whatever noise that is but the last
item in this ciate London box box this
is their Wonderland mascara it's just a
deluxe sized sample but it's pretty nice
it has a hourglass shaped wand to me
this looks like the pure fully charged
or the Too Faced better than sex or the
L'Oreal paradise like it's a very
similar one to that it gives me nice
volume I've used it like three times and
I have really enjoyed it but I'm someone
that I feel like I get along with a lot
of mascaras like you've got to be pretty
clumpy and not play nice for me not to
like you so I will continue using this
and I will give you a better idea if I
like it I still love my perversion more
alright we only have three more items
for this haul these were all sent to me
through octoly I love octal II it's a
way for me to get free product to try
out and review but they're all about
being really open and honest in your
review so it's like a win-win situation
so the first item this is a nail polish
from OPI and this is the grin and
Barrett color this is actually a
collaboration that OPI did with Ulta
they came out with three different
colors and the color I chose is this one
this is a beautiful ma vie nude pink
color it's cream the formula on this is
absolutely amazing you could get away
with one coat of this but I did do two
for light nude like this it's just
amazing so I highly recommend this if
you see it in the store again it is what
I'm wearing today and what you'll see in
the close-up swatches this is super
similar to the go-go geisha color from
the SE fall 2016
election which I really really love so
if you were looking for something or you
usually like OPI better I would check
this one out the next item is something
that Lancome sent me and this is a
highlighter I believe they came out with
five different shades and I got the
shade zero one shimmering buff it's
their dual finished highlighter so
you're supposed to be able to use this
wet or dry
this is glittery I think sometimes these
older counter makeup brands don't get as
much love especially here on YouTube and
the internet but this is super beautiful
if you like a more metallic highlighter
this one is really nice and this is it
just dry I don't think that I will be
using mine wet I might try it just to
see how it works but for me it's like
this is definitely intense for my
preferences but I do really like it it's
just so pretty and it's kind of cool to
see it from Lancome because this is
something I think a little bit you know
unexpected maybe really trendy with a
younger generation than what you would
expect from them so I do really like
this and I love that they have a couple
different colors to find the one that
matches your skin tone the best in the
last item for the haul these are a
shampoo and conditioner from Malin and
gets I believe that's how you pronounce
it this is the peppermint shampoo and
the cilantro hair conditioner when I saw
these pop up on the site I was really
excited to try them because I love the
smells like the description of the smell
this smells like straight-up peppermint
which is amazing and then the cilantro
conditioner I was like I want to smell
them and I think they would smell so so
good together and it does it smells so
good I cannot wait to try these on my
hair these are basically meant for all
hair types and skin types it's supposed
to help like get rid of build-up so I am
excited to try these out and I will come
back and let you know what I think do
you last shampoo and conditioner I got
from octoly I liked the shampoo but I
did not like the conditioner so
hopefully I will like these I can't
believe we did it but we made it to the
end of the hall guys I hope you enjoyed
seeing some of the new items that are
gonna be in my collection that you're
gonna be seeing around in other videos
again let me know what you guys want to
see in videos if there's anything you
want to see more in depth definitely let
me know and also let me know what you
guys have picked up recently if it's
been any of this stuff if you like it if
you don't and I will see you in my next
video thank you so so much for
