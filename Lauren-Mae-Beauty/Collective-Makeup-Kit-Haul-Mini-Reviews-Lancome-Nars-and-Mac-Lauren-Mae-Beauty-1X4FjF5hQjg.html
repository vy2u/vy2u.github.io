learn thanks so much for watching I
thought I would do a haul today because
I haven't done like an official haul on
my channel in a long time I have been
getting a lot of stuff recently but well
I'm gonna grab my NARS stuff actually
and put that in this video
one second guy anyway I have recently
been going to a couple different makeup
demos which had been really fun I've
been sucked into buying some products
which I mostly have been buying for my
kit I'm also going to be including some
products I got from Lancome recently
which I also got with the intention of
using them in my kit and I'm really
excited about those two so it's gonna be
kind of a long haul video so I'm gonna
try to go fast but it's kind of hard I
have a ton of stuff for Mac at the end
I'm probably just gonna do at the end
because it'll just be like Mac so first
again like I said I'm going to talk
about Lancome these were given to me
complimentary from Lancome through
octoly but still these are just 100%
honest reviews I have used these a
little bit they're kind of like first
impression reviews because I just use
them today but I do already have some
feelings on them so yeah let's just get
into it these here are the absolute
powders from Lancome this first one is
an absolute golden and this one's an
absolute peach I use absolute peach
today and I was excited to get these I
like that I was able to try two
different colors I was excited to put
these in my kit and not that I'm not
excited anymore but these are definitely
different than what I thought they were
gonna be this is the packaging that they
came in a really pretty silver box and
what this says is it's a radiant
smoothing powder and when they say
radiant they mean that it's radiant I
used the peach one today like I said to
put underneath my eyes kind of almost
use it like I would bake with it and
it's very shimmery and that doesn't
necessarily mean it's a bad thing it's
just definitely not something I would do
again like I feel like I look really
pretty but it was definitely like
intense I feel like for a face powder so
this is a little bit of that it's like a
yellowy color I don't know if this shine
is gonna pick up on camera I also have
like really bright lights on but this is
definitely
has radiance to it and in the way that I
putted on it was a little too much so
I'm gonna be trying this with different
products I really think it'd be nice to
be used on areas of the face where you
want to highlight or add just a little
bit of glow a little bit of like
radiance I definitely think it's nice
for that I wouldn't use it like you
would a traditional loose powder to bake
or do anything like that I wouldn't use
it as a setting powder if that makes
sense it's more a finishing powder and
it's really soft really nice it's just
different than what I just like when in
doing for me personally I would also use
this as like a highlighter I'm not
someone who likes something that's super
metallic and this just gives a really
nice Sheen to the skin I put it on my
cheekbones today I don't know if you're
gonna be able to tell with like my
glasses and the lights but I'm still you
know trying this out and seeing how I
like it it's nice it's just definitely
more radiant than not so if you're
looking for something that's really
luminous and radiant in a powder you
would like this or if you're dry skinned
but it definitely has the shimmer it's
definitely a little sugary and then just
so you guys know this is the absolute
golden and this is the same exact thing
it's just in a darker color that's it
there it's kind of like a cooler toned
bronzy type of shade that's what it
looks like in the packaging and again it
just has that luminosity it's such a
nicely finely milled powder even this
though honestly if I was using it as a
highlighter or even a setting powder I
could use this shade on myself and I
really don't think that it would really
you know make me look darker it doesn't
have a ton of pigment it is more
shimmery than pigmented that makes sense
anyway I'm gonna be trying this out in
different ways trying them out on
clients seeing how I like them and I
will get back to you guys on these ok
and then the last things that I picked
up from Lancome from Oxley these are
color correctors I was really excited
when I saw these these look like makeup
forever packaging which I really like
these are the 10th idol ultra wear
camouflage correctors and they have 5
different colors this is the green one
they have a lavender one peach one a
yellow one
and then this one they call orange-red
which I don't think it's quite orange
right so first off packaging I love the
packaging these are so easy to squirt
out on a pallet or on the back of your
like sanitized hand or whatever you're
gonna do I just like how easy it is it's
very sanitary and honestly I feel like
this product is is more targeted for
professional makeup artists because if
you are a regular consumer or someone
who does makeup but maybe doesn't you
know do other people's makeup you're not
gonna need every single one of these I
do think that one of the shades might
work for someone and in everyday aspects
but really I feel like these are best
suited for more professional makeup
artists people who are doing makeup on
other people for a living
or on a more consistent basis today I
did use two different ones this is the
green one and then the peach one I use
this to counteract dark circles under my
eyes I really did enjoy this this is
definitely more of a lighter orangie
peach it doesn't have that much red in
it but these things are pigmented when I
tell you they're pigmented honey you
need that much maybe not even that much
I honestly wanted to like thin these out
it's not that they're thick it was more
thinning them out because of the
pigmentation it just definitely a little
goes a long way I felt like the peach
one worked really nice so so far that
one's my favorite out of what I've used
the green one I used today this is the
one that I'm telling you thinning out
would be very important because this
just has so much pigment I mean you
wouldn't put that on your face to color
correct something you don't have redness
this intense to have green this intense
to counteract it and to neutralize it so
I definitely would like thin this out or
even kind of like add these to other
characters I have so for example I think
that this yellow one would be a great
mix in if something wasn't yellow enough
for someone's skin tone anything that
has like almost like a purple tinge this
is gonna help with that so I think these
would be great for mix-ins because they
are so pigmented but honestly they're
just they're pretty pigmented and not
and is another reason I feel like these
are best suited for professionals
because someone who you know doesn't
have as much just knowledge working with
color correction and working with
product I just feel like these could be
a little bit difficult they're not like
super user-friendly in that way but I do
enjoy that they're pigmented these will
last you forever these will last you
forever and then just to touch on the
orange red honestly I'm not sure how I
feel about this color I'm gonna have to
use it in the field to really like know
what I think about it that's it there
this would be great for like darker skin
tones if you're trying to correct like
darkness I just don't know if this is
rich enough in like red pigment like red
orange pigment to counteract as well as
something else' is I definitely want to
use this and try it out it's a pretty
color again it'd be a nice mixer into
potentially like foundations and kind of
custom mixing stuff and it's super
pigmented which I do like I just would
need to try that color out because it's
definitely I feel like a unique color
that's everything for Lancome I will
keep you up-to-date let me know if you
want to see like a color correcting
video like all about color correction
where it can use these products use
other products that I have and just kind
of talk to you about color correction I
feel like there's a lot on color
correction out in the world I don't know
how much of it is good information but
it's fi out there and I feel like that's
part of the reason these probably have
come out because it's trendy so you know
people see color correction and then o
want to do it where is it you know I
don't know I feel like it's it's not as
serious as as every other trend or
Instagram video would suggest so moving
on to nerd stuff I picked up five items
when I went to the NARS store on Melrose
I went and saw a demo and they had
champagne it was really fun I got a few
things for my kid I got something for
myself it was just in all over a good
shopping trip so two of the things I
picked up these are the soft matte
complete concealers I picked up medium
dark 2.5 in chestnut and that's what
that looks like and then I also picked
up the shade medium 1.5 in macadamia and
that's what that one looks like these
are just two colors I feel like that I
could mix together and create shades
that would work for a lot of the clients
that I do work on when you
are picking stuff for your kit I mean
obviously it'd be amazing to have all
the shades of everything but
realistically price-wise it doesn't
always match up so I like to pick out
some of the gist most popular shades the
shades that I feel like I'd work on the
most and then as I build my kit I can
add in a lighter shade or a darker shade
and it's not like I don't have other
things in my collection if I really
wanted to use these I could use other
products to lighten and darken so that's
what I have here these are beautifully
textured I really find that in my kit I
use concealers a ton just concealers I
always have on me so I'm excited to have
these in my kit and teasy how'd it feel
it product sucked me in also this is the
NARS a velvet lip glide in the color
bound obviously a super trendy color I
picked this up because I thought that it
would just be a nice addition to my kid
it's really beautiful I don't think that
these are matte and maybe as you wear
them throughout the day they'd be more
matte but on their own initial swipe
wise they aren't matte so just so you
guys know I like a formula like this
like I said a million times I feel like
I'm not someone who's into liquid
lipsticks that drag down especially on
set because they're really just a pain
in the butt to have to touch up like you
can't let you're over them sometimes
they start flicking off it just sucks
and you just don't have the time to fix
that type of situation if it occurs so I
personally like something that I can
just run in touch-up add some more
product and it's good to go so I do like
this for that I have used this since
then it's a beautiful color it just
works for so much I can use this for
more like natural stuff or more glam and
then with that I don't know I have an
obsession with blood pencils so I picked
up the velvet lip liner and this is the
color Marie island Beach it's very hard
for me to say I actually use this in my
em cosmetics video if you haven't seen
that I'll leave a link down below it's a
beautiful color it looks really nice
it's a darker nude and I feel like I'll
get a lot of use out of this I can use
this on lighter skin tones I can use
this on darker skin tones it's just a
nice overall color this formula is also
super long-lasting I found that out when
I was testing out the in cosmetics I
would definitely suggest filling in
the entire lip with this lip liner if
you're gonna use it because if not it's
gonna stay so if you just put on the
outside and whatever you're using is
maybe a little bit lighter or wears off
it's gonna look kind of like chola lips
it's just kind of crazy so I definitely
suggest using this to prolong the entire
aware of your lip and fill in your whole
lip when you use these pencils and
lastly something I picked up for myself
I was cheap and just picked up the
refill instead of the entire compact it
was like an extra $10 and I just didn't
want to spend it like I got 20% off but
I still didn't want to spend it so this
is the radiant cream compact foundation
and I have liked number two in Mont
Blanc and that's what it looks like I
have a pretty big dent going in it you
really don't need a lot of this product
it is insanely creamy I really do like
it I've been using it basically since I
got it it works really nice I like it
with a sponge I like it with a brush I
don't feel like it controls my oils but
I also don't feel like I get overly
shiny with it and I don't know if I'd
repurchase it at the moment I've been
enjoying it but it's not like a Holy
Grail yet I'm just still finding out how
I like it
yeah it's nice I like this though these
would be awesome to have in my kit but I
just feel like they make up forevers I
get a better deal on so but these are
this is really nice it's a great
touch-up product on the go too it has
great coverage but looks like skin we
are moving on to Mac yesterday I went to
a Mac demo and I was really excited
because I'm not a Mac girl I've never
really been into Mac I've always just
looked at it from afar it was kind of
just an intimidating brand to me I know
a bit about Mac because of other people
online but it's not from like a ton of
personal experience so when I went to
the demo I was excited because I was
hoping to get like my pro card and go
shopping around and I was able to get
40% off in there yesterday and hopefully
we'll get my pro card soon so I got kind
of a lot of stuff um
I don't know I went kind of crazy I'm
really excited for these products I I
don't know I'm excited to see what max
all about and I got a lot of stuff for
my kit that I'm excited about I got a
few things for myself that I'm excited
about so let's just get into what I got
I'll try to go in some type of order but
no promises this is actually something I
picked up at the last minute this is the
oil control lotion and I am wearing that
today I just thought that this would be
a nice little size to try out also to
put in my kit you'll hear me say it a
million times that's my makeup kit like
the makeup I bring on set with me this
is really nice
this just feels so nice and smooth on
the skin but it doesn't feel overly
lotion II I really like this scent of
their products like I love the smell of
mac fix+ so much and this smells like
mac fix+ like more manly and a little
herbal but it just smells really good I
really like it it feels really nice on
the skin so I'm really excited to have
some more like skin care stuff in my kit
I also picked up mac fix+ I have already
gone through a full mac fix+ in the past
so I just picked up another one I wanted
to have this for my kid and just to use
as like a refresher a center just in
general a nice product this is great for
refreshing just pampering your clients
but also if you feel like something's
looking a little too powdery it's great
to spray on at the end yeah I just
really like this if someone's really dry
and this smells so good
oh yeah this is also good I just love
this smell guys seriously and then I
also picked up a small mac fix+ because
this is in the scent of coconut and I
was always wanting to try their coconut
scented stuff I'm not gonna lie though I
don't really like this end I just like
the original scent of mac fix+ so much
that I just I don't know it's just a
little underwhelming to me so if you're
thinking about getting one of the other
scents just get mac fix+ it's better it
just smells amazing on its own it didn't
even need to be changed I'm so excited
to unbox all this stuff and put it away
you have no idea
it's gonna be so fun that's like one of
the funnest things like putting all your
stuff away organizing it I love that I
picked up a few foundations for my kit
these are their newer products this is
the next to nothing face color this is a
pretty sheer foundation I got this for
more like everyday men's grooming like
on set for something that's just really
low coverage you know it just perfects
the skin a little bit so the colors I
got I got medium light and then I think
just dark so I can always add products
to these add concealer or whatever if I
want more coverage and then I can mix
between these shapes to get the right
shapes for whoever I'm working on I'll
show you the medium because I feel like
it will actually show up these are just
beautiful on the skin they feel so nice
they definitely have some coverage I
mean it's not just like absolutely
nothing but it's just very light still
definitely looks like skin it's just
like a little bit more perfected it
looks really hydrated and natural and
nice I'm so excited to use these on set
I'm working on a short film coming up in
May so I really want to use these then
they also just feel so nice on the skin
like my skin just feels soft I love that
it's almost like skin care and
foundation in one so I am so excited to
use those now with those products I did
pick up the powders that went with them
I got two shades instead of three this
is the shade light and it's in there
again next to nothing powder I thought
this would just be such a nice powder to
put on top has a nice like satiny finish
so it definitely looks like skin but it
will mattify and kind of set that
foundation I am so excited to just try
these out I've never had Mac stuff
before I'm so excited and the other
color I got was medium dark I really
like medium dark type of colors because
feel like I can use them almost on
anyone so let me show you what it looks
like that's what it looks like I can use
this to warm up someone's face if
they're looking a little pale this
actually doesn't even look that dark for
it being medium dark to me but it just
is so soft this powder is so finely
milled and soft and I
just excited to see how these products
pair together and see how they work I
mean getting new products and trying
them out is one of the funnest things I
feel like to use on people I love trying
new products I'm product junkie at heart
and I'm just so excited to see how those
base products work on my clients
especially when I'm trying to go for
that really natural look but still nice
and perfected as much as possible if
that makes sense I'm gonna show you
something I picked up for me I picked up
Mac Turk kwatak and I picked up the
smaller size because I I do really love
the scent like I figured I would the way
everyone describes it I was like I feel
like that's a scent for me and honey it
is it smells so freakin good it just
smells really really nice but I picked
up the small one just in case I get
tired of it or whatever I don't have a
huge thing to run through I can always
get a bigger size I think the packaging
is okay um it's just like kind of hard
like it kind of cuts you so I don't like
that part about it like I wish it was
just a glass bottle like this but anyway
smell wise it smells absolutely amazing
really like it definitely more of like a
unisex scent I would say which I feel
like is what I gravitate to so love this
it's just so much stuff guys I only
picked up a couple I products the first
one here is Costa reach this is
something that is specifically for me I
picked this up because I've heard so
many amazing things I personally prefer
a brown instead of a black I just feel
like it brings the blue out of my eyes
so this one's so pretty I also really
want to get Teddy but I was just trying
to keep it under control keep it chill
but this one I will probably be putting
in my own personal collection and then
the other eye product that I got is
painterly from Mac oh my gosh like such
an iconic product this is just a Paint
Pot I really wanted something that I
could use on clients to just tone out a
lot of the discoloration on the lid and
so I'm excited to try this out see how
it works I tend to do eyes first before
foundation so I don't already have like
concealer out to put on so I thought
this would be nice it Prime's
and conceals at the same time okay the
rest of the products are lip products I
got I have five more to go guys that's
and then you guys can move on move on
with their life the first one I'm
actually wearing this is the color whirl
from Mac this is just a lip liner I'd
have never had a Mac lip liner before so
I want to try it out that's it there if
the swatch on the lip wasn't enough
again this is a great nude for lighter
skin darker skin I can use this on so
many people and the other color I picked
up was the color dervish I've heard
makeup by Tiffany do you talk about this
pencil so many times I just thought it
was a nice color so that's it they're
definitely a little bit more pinky not
as Brown I just love lip liners so much
so yeah oh no I have like a big like
awesome amazing product at the end I
almost forget about it but it's Rimac
but I'll show you that at the end anyway
last like products makeup products these
are three lipsticks I picked up the
color syrup Verve and also cream in your
coffee I think these are all cream sheen
versions of their lipsticks which is
just a type of formula so that there is
cream and your coffee a beautiful nude I
think this would look great again on so
many skin tones and I personally like
the cream machine the formula because it
is just easy to wear I don't like a
super full opacity lips unless I'm doing
something really glam on someone I just
find that you could do the lip liner and
then a nice sheer color over top of it
and it would just it just looks really
good and natural and not overdone this
is the color syrup right there and then
last is a verb and it's the deepest out
of everything and that's it on the end I
just thought that one was really nice
too this is actually a satin so this one
is more pigmented but it's just not like
some of their mats and some of their
colors are just a little too intense for
me on the everyday and I really wanted
to get shades that I feel like I could
mix and match and do a lot of different
things for a lot of different skin tones
and a lot of different clients actually
work on so yeah those are some swatches
of the lip products I would love to know
your guys's recommendations for
lipsticks I feel like I'm turning into a
matte girl like I can just see myself
once I get before a percent discount
home my honey I'm so excited to just
delve more into Mac and just have some
products like I really want some face
and body I really want some of the
mineralized skinfinish in
I have no Mac blushes although I have so
many great blushes in my collection and
in my kit I don't feel like I need those
Ellie's not now but I'm just excited to
kind of just try out so much more from
what they have to offer especially even
on the skin carry side I know a lot of
people talk about like Mac breaks them
out or whatever but I really want to
like look into it for myself because I'm
very impressed by the few products that
I have tried that I would love to just
see what they have yeah you know okay
guys we saved the best for last I don't
know how I was blessed enough on this
earth to get this complimentary but I
was hooked the eff up y'all with this
bag here this is the travel makeup case
and I just got this at the end and and I
just didn't really realize like oh you
know I was just like oh my gosh thinks
it's so awesome you know this is like
expensive I looked on the site to see
how much this would retail for because
once I opened it I realized that this
thing is not messing around and I'm so
excited to put my products in it so I
can't even show you because I'm not
gonna be in frame this is what it looks
like so this is one side of it has all
of the clear plastic containers to put
your products as a middle insert that
you can put stuff in and then it has a
whole mesh side crazy right oh my gosh
I'm so excited with the kid I'm using
now I don't know I'm excited to see how
much of that I can fit in here because
this is so small and compact and amazing
where is my kit I'm using now I love it
and it's really nice but it also is just
so bulky
it's very bulky and sometimes it's kind
of irritating so I'm excited to see what
I can fit into the travel bag oh it's
beautiful like for a makeup artist that
is just like a dream case like I can't
wait to put everything in there so
that's everything I hope you enjoyed
