Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk to you about some
skincare that I've been sent and I want
to give you just like overall reviews on
it it's gonna be the good the bad the
ugly I'm not holding back I'm just going
to let you know I don't talk about
skincare a ton on my channel it's mostly
makeup but a lot of you guys have been
commenting on my skin hang out a nice
skin which thank you so much I don't
feel like I do anything too crazy
but I thought you guys might be
interested in knowing what I've been
using and my thoughts on some products
some of us I haven't even talked about
on my channel at all but I just wanted
to give you the lowdown on some of these
products I've used them for a while so I
have some thoughts on them and let's get
into it I'm thinking about doing these
in the future too with like more
skincare it's just easier to lump it all
in one group instead of doing like
specific skincare videos so hopefully
you guys like that this specific set of
stuff I think all of it has been sent to
me in some capacity or the other like
it's somehow I got it for free so the
first time I want to talk about it stuff
I got through Influenster and I was
accepted for the origins Vox box this is
all about the ginseng range so the first
thing here this is the refreshing scrub
cleanser the best thing I like about
this line is the smell this has a really
nice like citrusy orange refreshing
smell which is great but this product
specifically is just not a good scrub
the beads in here are very gentle and it
is supposed to be I believe a gentle
exfoliator but it's too gentle for me
it's not worth the money because I need
something that's like really gonna like
you know get in there make my skin nice
and soft for makeup application and for
applying moisturizer so I do not
recommend that I don't think you should
spend the money on it I will finish it
up and use it but I would never purchase
that the next item that I got is the
ginseng energy boosting gel moisturizer
and this is something we're almost done
with actually me and Sam have been using
this for a while obviously this has that
really nice refreshing citrus scent as
well and I do like this I think it's
really nice this is perfect for putting
on my face before I put on makeup it's
lightweight but I still feel nice and
plump and moisturized this product is
quite expensive so I'm not sure if I
would shell up the money for it but I
did enjoy it and I do recommend
if you were looking at something from
origins this is a nice moisturizer and
the last item here this is the origins
ginseng refreshing eye cream to brighten
and to puff this is quite a large eye
cream I feel like and this only lasts
for six months you got to use it up
pretty dang fast at least for the you
know amount of time it gives you on the
jar I have a love-hate relationship with
this I think this is nice it definitely
works best to use it in the daytime
because it's gonna do puff your eyes and
that's when you're gonna want it before
you put on makeup
it also has light reflecting particles
in it so it's it almost has like a
shimmer to it sam says he looks like a
fish or something because it has that
Sheen so you know keep that in mind that
might be something that's a positive to
you that might be something that's a
negative to me it's just back and forth
I'm realizing what I like and I creams
and what I don't this is just a little
too heavy like it just almost feels
tacky for me I just want moisture
without any of the heaviness and without
the tackiness I just want that skin to
feel nice and soft and plump and
moisturized without feeling heavy
without I don't know I it's just not my
favorite I will finish this up and use
it but I definitely don't love it I just
think there's better eye creams out
there especially at a better price point
why should we talk about next I'm just
gonna talk about these masks next I have
talked about these on my channel a
little bit more but I thought I would
just mention them in here these are from
the brand cosmetics and one of them is a
detox activated charcoal mask this is
really nice I like both of these just to
kind of spoil it this is really nice it
comes out great has the activated
charcoal to help pull out impurities
from your skin the thing I like about
this the most is that it doesn't dry
super hard and cakey on the skin so if
you're someone who wants to do a
charcoal mask but doesn't want that
really tight feeling this isn't gonna
give you that like the glam glow mask
does it also doesn't have a bunch of
particles in it that's gonna exfoliate
as you take it off either when I talked
about this before I mentioned that it
felt almost like a velvet latex on the
skin and that's what it feels like it
almost feels like you should be able to
peel it off the way it sits on the skin
which is so different than any of
clay masks I've used but I do really
like this and I enjoy using it I think
this is priced at about $40 which is
pretty expensive I'm not sure if I would
pay that price for it but I do think
that the product works and it's really
nice and the other product is the
restore moisture rich Mass this is
really nice as well I'm finding that
although my skin is oily I just have a
lot of dry spots lately and my skin is
really needing a lot of moisture this
definitely helped
it feels pretty balmy on the skin and
you can towel this away and leave a
little bit of residue on your skin if
you want throughout the night while you
sleep it's really kind of whatever you
want to do but I do like this product I
definitely think it helps and is doing
what it's supposed to so I do like that
as well it's the same price point as the
other one and I kind of feel the same
way it's hard for me to shell out my own
money so I I feel uncomfortable telling
you that it's worth it in to go buy it
expensive skincare to me is something
that's kind of a difficult thing like if
I'm not paying for it myself
it's really hard for me to be like
definitely go buy it so I do think this
is nice and I think it works if you were
looking into this product but I'm not
sure if I would repurchase it at the
moment the next brand I want to talk
about is a new do I do have quite a few
products from them they reached out to
me wanted to send me stuff and what I do
like about this brand is they didn't
like pressure me into making a video I
think I even said like I'm not I'm not
like promising to make a video on them
and they're like that's fine we just
want you to try it I mean that was her
whole email so that was really awesome I
feel like a lot of brands they only want
to send you stuff if you like promise
you're going to do a video and do all
this crap with them so it was nice to
not feel pressured and to kind of use
this in my own time and when I wanted to
but sadly I do not like this brand this
is a more all-natural brand I really
like the packaging it's really pretty
it's white with the gold but everything
I've tried I really don't like I think
the worst offender for me is this eye
cream this is the anti-aging all skin
types natural beauty I cream I don't
like the smell of these products they
are more natural but it's just it's not
my favorite and then for me everything
is just heavy and sticky but not heavy
and like a oh it's heavy and really
moisturizing it's just great I just do
not like the way it feels on my skin
this eye
I have tried multiple multiple times I
want to like it so bad but I just don't
it's so sticky under the eye
it feels really heavy I'm pretty sure it
gave me the little Millia so this is a
no I will be passing this on to my mom
and the price of this is expensive this
is sensi by dollars i did not realize
how expensive these products where i
went and kind of looked him up before i
did this video and i was like holy crap
this is $65 I'm just not a fan I'm just
not a fan of it I want to like it but I
just do not like the way it feels on my
under eye and so I end up not using it
and that's how I know I don't like it
because I'm not someone to use an eye
cream naturally so it has to be a good
one for me to actually like use it and
enjoy using it I have two different
moisturizers from them this one is the
softening moisturizer and it's for oily
skin again it just I don't know there's
just something about it don't like the
way it sits on my skin I don't like the
way it feels on my skin I don't like the
way it smells and for the price again
that one is quite expensive I think it's
in the 40 or 50 or $60 range no I
wouldn't pay for it and I honestly don't
suggest it from my experience you guys
might like it definitely look up other
reviews because I I feel like I'm pretty
finicky when it comes to lotions and
moisturizers and things the other
moisturizer is this overnight radiance
renewal cream this is something that
they actually sent me after sending me
like this whole big box she reached back
out to me because this is a newer
product and was like oh we have a new
product if you want to try it I'd love
to send it if your address is the same
so I was like I mean if you want to send
it through go ahead this is expensive
this is 115 dollars so expensive and
again I just don't like it my mom is
gonna get awesome gifts I wanna like it
so bad but just every time I use it it's
just not my favorite I don't like the
way it sinks in and I can't deny that I
can't I can't denying it so I'm not
going to it feels so good on the hand
too I feel like that is such a deceiving
thing I put things on my hand I'm like
oh it feels so good I'm gonna love it
and then you know when I put it on my
face it's just not the same so I do not
like that this toner is okay this is the
heels and soften reviving toner you put
on a cotton pad it's kind of tiny if you
like for a toner I don't think it's bad
but I wouldn't buy it it's a little bit
less expensive than every
I think it's in like 20 or 18 or 21
dollars or something so that's how I
feel about the new do stuff I hate that
I don't have a positive review but um I
don't I didn't really like it next is a
product from may lub and this is the Sun
protector it's a sheer mineral sunscreen
SPF 30 I actually meant with the Creator
or the joint creator of this brand so
that was really cool she was so nice and
I'm super excited to try this out
everything about this brand I really
like and I was so excited to try out a
sunscreen that would hopefully be like
lightweight on the skin not be like full
of a bunch of chemicals and have like a
soft touch and not feel greasy um and
this is not it for me guys I've used
this quite a bit I use this one I went
on the boat this feels sticky on the
skin like I put this on the skin and
then my skin just feels tacky and it
also it's not greasy it just doesn't
feel smooth so it's not a good base to
put makeup on top of for me I don't like
it on my skin I'm really weird it's
lotion I don't like a lot of lotions on
my skin so when I have it on the skin
and I'm like trying to protect myself we
went to Disneyland and use this it just
doesn't feel good it's just not
something that I like this retails for
$29 which is a really good price for I
know how much work she's put into this
and she really tried to have like the
best ingredients and get it at the best
price possible but I'm just I'm not a
fan of it I'm not a fan I feel bad
because I want to like it again so much
for the you know the ideas behind it but
it's not a product that worked for me
personally the next product I want to
talk about is from made simple skincare
I did a whole beauty brand spotlight
which I will leave link down below if
you want to check out other products
that I've tried from them this is an
all-natural organic raw company and this
is the face serum which has a rose hip
and chamomile I wanted to talk about
this again because I have used almost
half of it at this point and I do really
like it it isn't oil which is not normal
for me to like but this has really been
helping with my drier skin so sometimes
I'll put this on first and then put
moisturizer on top of it sometimes I'll
mix a squirt or two in with my
moisturizer or whatever I'm feeling
usually I don't do that everyday but
I'll do it like every other day or every
third night and whenever I feel like my
skin really needs it and I have really
been enjoying it so if you're looking
for an oil this is a nice one price-wise
I think this is
and I think this is about 42 dollars
which is expensive but I do think that
they put a lot of time and care and if
you're looking for good ingredients this
is nice something that I'm noticing
though with these natural brands is that
they put they tell you that these things
are like a serum or an eye serum or
whatever and it's all oil based like
anything natural I've come across is
usually oil-based and I feel like it's
not like super blatantly said that it's
oil like this says it's a face serum so
if you're just ordering that off the
website maybe not looking at ingredients
it's like when you get it you're like oh
you mean like a face oil like that's
what this is this is not a serum and
that's kind of my complaint with the
next product so this is something that I
received via octiline this is the
essential eye serum from genuine globe
natural skincare I was excited to try
this out because it's a I serum so you
would use this like under an eye cream
and I liked that it was in a rollerball
was super excited to try it out and lo
and behold it's freaking oil guys I have
used this like once or twice and luckily
you can just like put a little bit on
but it just freaks me out to put just
like oil on my under eyes I feel like
that's pretty dang heavy so although
this isn't the most comprehensive review
on this product specifically I'm gonna
try this out a little bit more and see
how I feel about it I just wish I knew
it wasn't oil going into it and I
probably wouldn't have like wanted to
talk about it and that's kind of my tip
to come away with at least right now is
if you're gonna try some like really
natural skincare be prepared that's
probably gonna be oil or really do your
research and see what those ingredients
are because this is like straight up
like rosehip oil and other oils it's not
a serum like I thought this was going to
be really watery really thin sink into
the skin super fast and then you would
put on top of it a cream but it is not
and to leave this on a positive note I
did want to talk about a night cream
that I do like this I did get from
Bioderma like a school event that I went
to this is the Scentsy bio eye contour
gel I really like this and this is the
type of eye cream that I want to try
from other brain
and that I would love to yeah try out
from other brands this is moisturizing
but it's not thick it doesn't feel it
just sinks in so fast and this is like a
fraction of the price of the other ones
I talked about so I really have been
enjoying this I actually have one in my
kit and then I pulled this one out of my
backup drawer because I just I haven't
been enjoying those other ones so at
least for when I'm putting my makeup on
or when I just feel like I can't use the
other ones I've been using this and it
just reminds me of what I like and what
I actually enjoy in an eye cream and
this is it this is a great one I also
really like the embryo Lisa won and I
bought that one and it's like I think
it's like twenty four or maybe thirty
two dollars it's so good love that one
miss it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I know it was a lot of skincare
but I kind of wanted to give you guys
some reviews and just some thoughts on
skincare that's been sent to me recently
and let you know what I thought because
this is mostly what I've been using the
last little bit and yeah I probably will
do these periodically throughout my
channel definitely let me know if you
want to see that or if you want to see
any more like in-depth things with these
products I'm also thinking about doing
something with masks on my channel I
really like Jacqueline's like Jack chats
or masks and chats I cannot remember the
name of them specifically right now but
I know it's like super cute and has jack
and masks and chats and they all kind of
like not rhyme but have alliteration
anyway I'm trying to figure out how I
can do that I kind of want to do like a
movie in a mask like talk about a movie
which I know is not really my channel
we're all Beauty here but I love movies
and shows so I was thinking like a mask
in a movie and I don't know it was just
something I was playing around with
anyway that is everything thank you so
so much for watching guys I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
