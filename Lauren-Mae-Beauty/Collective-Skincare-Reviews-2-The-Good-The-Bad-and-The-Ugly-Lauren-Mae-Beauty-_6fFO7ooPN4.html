learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a collective
skincare review video I have done one of
these in the past and you guys seem to
like it so I thought I would do another
one
I do get sent a lot of different
skincare items and after I try it out
it's like I don't want to make
individual review videos for all of them
because it's just so much work to focus
on one item for the duration of a video
when I can make something like this do
something collective tell you guys about
a bunch of different skincare products
I've been using and my thoughts I don't
know it's just kind of nice and if you
like skincare you get a bunch of
different things all in one videos so
that being said a lot of this stuff was
sent to me I think most of it except for
a couple items or things that I either
got samples or I purchased so yeah I've
been trying this stuff for a while so I
thought I would share my reviews on them
with you guys I have had a lot of people
ask for a like skincare routine video
I'm kind of basic guys and so I might do
that coming up but I don't know I'm just
so basic it's like four products so I'm
you know let's just get into it I want
to start off with some really cute
things I love the packaging on these
guys and this is a brand I'd never heard
of before it's called Saturday skin I
got these via octal II and this here is
their daily do hydrating essence mist
now I've been using this just in my
skincare routine basically after I
cleanse my face and then before I go in
with a serum or moisturizer and this is
okay this comes with let's see four
point three nine fluid ounces now
honestly when it comes to spray things I
like things to have left at least eight
ounces because I just think you go
through them really fast so I like them
to be as big as possible but I do think
the packaging is super duper cute
sprayer wise on this I think the sprayer
is really nice it's nice and fine
because this is such a cute product I
honestly thought it was gonna have a
smell to it but it doesn't there's no
nice scent it just it kind of smells
like the skin to Naevia setting sprays
to me so I like this I think it's okay I
will leave the price on the screen but
I'm pretty sure it's kind of expensive
so I would not pay the price for this
but I think it's cute it says on here
that Teen Vogue named this the
GameChanger of 2016 so someone liked it
at Vogue or Teen Vogue
it says hit refresh concentrated
extracts of kiwi and grape quench and
nourish that's why I thought it would
smell good but there's no Kiwis there's
no grapes it does not smell good it
doesn't smell bad though you know how I
am with skincare in my sense my gosh if
something smells bad I can't stand it
but um they definitely win for cute
packaging like they definitely won for
that but how much does that mean when
the product is really what you're using
anyway the other product here this is
actually an eye cream guys I know it's
massive when I got this I was like what
the Freak this is such a big product for
an eye cream and so this is their wide
awake brightening eye cream so I was
checking this out and this has one point
zero one fluid ounces in it which is a
lot of product for an eye cream my
Bioderma one which is what I really like
it's quite thin it's nice it's
refreshing it's easy that one has half
the fluid out in it so this is double
the product in it so I felt like that
kind of at least justified the size this
is kind of like you know a statement
product on your shelf and takes up a lot
of room but I am glad that you get
basically double the product of a lot of
eye creams this is a bit expensive but
again I would cut that price in half to
compare to other like products and like
the price you're getting for the amount
you're getting I think it makes it
definitely more reasonable and it puts
it I think in the 20 something dollar
range I do like this I think it's nice
it has a pump on it which is great but
this pump does dispense a lot of product
I definitely find that I only need to do
the tiniest bit like a third of the pump
and that will definitely cover both my
eyes I don't find it like brightens that
that much but it is nice and hydrating
I've used it day and night and yeah I
don't know it's nice again I don't know
if I'd pay for it but I do enjoy the
product and both of these I believe our
Korean skincare brands they just aren't
anything amazing to me but they're
definitely not bad products next is
something from number 7 beauty this is
the protect and perfect intense advanced
serum and this was also sent to me from
octiline I have been using this morning
and night under my moisturizer and I do
really like it I think it's nice I think
it's also a very small size though this
is
on a fluid ounce and although that seems
like a DC man I just think I'm going to
go through this really fast because I
already can definitely see the wear that
I have in it again prices will be on the
screen what I consider purchasing this
yeah if I got a good deal on number
seven beauty I think that it's a nice
serum with skincare I definitely think
that it's hard to tell if it's like
really doing anti-aging stuff unless
you're using it for like I'm talking
like you know months but this does feel
really nice I do like the added
hydration and the silky feel that it
gives my skin so this is something I do
suggest if you want to try this out and
want to try something drugstore this is
good I wanted to include something that
I've been using for a really long time
this is the Cetaphil moisturizing cream
now it says body on here but you can use
this on your face let's see I don't know
where I saw that but I definitely saw it
somewhere so me and Sam actually used
this on our face Sam has a very very dry
skin and I freaking love the way this
feels we are almost done with this we've
also gotten there like a half door of
this it's so good guys it doesn't have a
fragrance to it I don't need much
product I use this at night to really
hydrate my skin and it's amazing so and
it's so affordable I think I got this
and the other one like in a bundle pack
from Costco for like 11 or $15 and this
will last us probably well into next
year so yeah just letting you guys know
like that's how basic I usually come
with my skincare it's like that's my
night
Cetaphil body moisturizer again I'm
pretty sure I read somewhere basically
you can use it anywhere just for
whatever reason on this container it
does say body moving on to the next
product this is something from Lancome
again sent to me from octa Lee and this
is the energy de vie the illuminating
and purifying exfoliating mask now the
packaging on this is really nice it's
super duper heavy but then the cap is
kind of cheap to me I don't know it's
just like plastic I think that I don't
know they look almost seem like two
separate parts this is a very like
fragrance fresh product I don't know how
to explain it but this is
my favorite thing this is supposed to be
like a two one once with damask and then
when you rub it off it has these like
they're not actual like microbeads they
are particles that disperse as you like
scrub your face but they aren't hard
enough to actually scrub anything on my
face so I just feel like it only does
the job of the mask and even then I
didn't find that my skin was extra
bright or moisturizers are soft or
anything so this is not my favorite
product I'm going to continue to use it
and try it out and see if it works but I
don't suggest this and I know this is
probably a really pricey item I think
it's almost at $60 I have two more
things left to talk about in this video
and they both have to do with the eyes
I've been trying out a lot of different
eye products and this one here I did
recently talk about in a tree haul but I
wanted to mention it this is the it
bye-bye under-eye cream I bought this as
a deluxe sized sample from a Sephora
order and have really been enjoying this
product I really like the way it sits on
the under eye I use it at night because
it is quite moisturizing and honestly in
the morning I like something just a
little bit more thin but this doesn't
feel sticky I find that that's the
biggest issue that I have with under eye
creams I don't like when they feel
really sticky I'm very sensitive to
products going into my eyes and like
creating like gunk I just don't like it
I don't like anything feeling like oily
or sticky or nasty in my eyes so this is
actually really nice I'm not sure if I
would purchase the full size but out of
the eye creams that I have tried this is
one of my favorites in the last products
that I have here was actually a part of
my collective skincare reviews last time
but I thought I would give you guys an
update this is the genuine glow natural
skincare essential eye serum this is a
more natural brand and I was excited to
try this because it's an eye serum and I
thought it'd be nice to have something
that like goes into the skin really
sinks in it's doing like a really good
job of like fighting wrinkles and
moisturizing and then you would put a
moisturizing like eye cream on top of
that but this is an oil and I was not
expecting that I'm not a huge fan of
oils on my skin I do have oily skin
though I do find it's dehydrated so I do
like to have moisture but I just I don't
know on the under eye and oil just seems
weird and I kind of
the same way this hasn't broken me out
or done anything weird to my undereye
which is something that I was kind of
nervous about but it just is a little
bit heavy I'm gonna continue to try it
into winter like as my skin gets drier
with the colder months I'm gonna see if
this is something that really helps kind
of combat that but again I think I'm
just kind of weirded out by an oil on
the under eye and I think it's I don't
know tell me if I'm wrong but like I
feel like oils kind of can stop things
from sinking into the skin if you put
something on top of it so I don't know
if that would kind of stop any eye cream
I put on on top of this from actually
sinking into the skin and getting the
benefits of that so anyway that is a
little bit of an update on that I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video and let
me know if you've tried any of these
skincare products down below if you like
them if you don't and I hope you enjoyed
the video thank you so so much for
watching guys and I will see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
