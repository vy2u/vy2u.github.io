Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought I would recreate a look
that I've done in the past it was using
some of the newer color pop singles so
these are all from the festival
collection that came out a little bit
ago I do have one shadow in here that
isn't from that but I thought I would
recreate that look a lot of you guys
wanted to see how I did it so I thought
it'd be fun I haven't really talked
about these much on my channel I haven't
really seen that many people talk about
them and then I thought I would put
swatches at the end so there won't be a
timestamp for that if you want to just
see how these look if you want to see
some swatches so I hope you guys enjoy
I'm gonna zoom it soon and we can get
started on the tutorial alright so we're
just gonna get started I have already
primed my eyelids and the first shade
I'm gonna be going in with is this one
here it's a matte purple but it's like a
more warm toned pastel and is the shade
to tamango
I'm gonna be buffing this into the
crease this look is all colorful I don't
use like any neutrals at all not even
for like the crease shades so I'm going
to be taking inspiration from a look
that I did quite a few videos back it
was something that was like a little bit
more cool toned ish and also had a lot
of like purples and greens and blues it
was really pretty and it was just like a
fun makeup look so I'm going to recreate
it the best I can but also I might be
adding a few of my own little like
twists in there just to improve on it
you know I honestly don't plan out or
like do any of my looks before I
actually film them so yeah I feel like
if I'm gonna recreate a look there are
definite improvements you can always
make once you've done it once
so anyway I'm bringing this color into
the crease I'm blowing it out kind of
far just so we can actually see it
because we will be putting some darker
shades on the lid and I find that those
kind of can cover up a shadow I'm also
making sure to really focus it on this
inner portion today I'm gonna try to do
kind of like a cut crease situation
because I think it will complement the
glitter liner we're gonna put on a
little bit better so I'm gonna try that
kind of as a variation all right and we
have that nice and blended out I think
this is such a beautiful color it's so
vibrant but still pastel I really really
like it next I'm gonna be going in with
a smaller fluffy crease
brush and we're gonna go into the shade
143 which this is the one that was not a
part of the collection this is an older
shadow to color pops line and it's one
of my absolute favorites I think it's so
stunning so we're gonna be putting this
into the crease more and bringing this a
little bit lower so that we can start
building up more depth at the crease
line where we're gonna cut the crease
with concealer that's kind of what you
need you need that like pop of something
darker when you go in on the lid at
least that's what I feel like so I'm
going to be blending that a little bit
farther down into the crease and really
building up the color and don't be
afraid to like really put it down on to
the eye because again we're gonna go in
with the concealer to cut it so you
won't see anything like on the lid and I
really like again building up that
deepness right here on the inner corner
or on the inner part of the crease
because that's where you usually put the
lighter shade and that contrast is what
really makes the cut crease pop and I'm
trying to add all this depth now so that
way when we go in with the concealer I
don't have to come back and like add
even more definition it can just be
enough I know it looks kind of crazy now
but it's gonna look great
believe in yourself alright so I'm
feeling really good about where we're at
so far I'm gonna go back in with the
original blending brush and that to
tamango shade and we're just gonna blend
out the top portion I can already tell
this look is like gonna be better for
the cut crease today I'm going to be
using a cream concealer this one's from
Eden minerals I'm just gonna be flipping
this brush over it has like a more flat
shader side and I'm just going to cut
yeah the crease and cut out the eyelid
space we want this is gonna be a
different shape for every person so for
me I have a more hooded eye so I like to
take it a little bit higher so you can
see some of that shadow with my eyes
like straight up and like if I rest my
face and I'm just looking you cannot see
but I'm always like yeah and like moving
my eyelids and my eyebrows but anyway so
that's how I like to cut my crease for
my eye shape is just a little bit higher
so I'm do whatever you're comfortable
with I think
something that you have to get used to
all right so that's the start we have
I'm going to just kind of fade it into
this outside and I like to just tap my
finger so we don't have a harsh edge and
blend it so it's kind of like a half cut
crease I don't go like all the way till
the end and really keep that line
defined I just like it at that beginning
portion so that's what it looks like so
far I feel like they look pretty even
which is always a struggle so I'm pretty
happy with that I am gonna go back in
though and right at that line where we
did cut it I'm gonna take one four three
which is that darker purple a smaller
detail brush and I'm really going to
make sure we have a lot of depth there
and if you're lying for your concealer
isn't completely straight specifically
for this look it's okay you can always
go in and clean it up but also we're
going to be adding in a line there so
that can kind of help to cover up that
that line isn't completely even and then
I'm just going to hopefully fade out so
I don't want like a line of distinction
I still want it to fade nicely into the
lighter purple and then I'm gonna go
back over and just make sure we have a
pretty clean line I just personally like
that and I'm just trying to up my skills
so I'm going to make sure this inner
portion it is nice and crispy I think
it's looking really really good I'm
really happy with it so far
the next thing I'm gonna do is put some
glitter glue onto my lid this is gonna
help the other shadows stick really
nicely and you want to make sure you
keep it under obviously where the crease
is I'm using my finger but I will
probably just make sure with a brush
that everything's looking okay so on my
lid for the look that I did I put some
of this periwinkle I did like ingredient
I put the periwinkle I put this lighter
purple um no I did this darker purple
and then I think I did some teal in the
outer corner or maybe it was like the
lighter periwinkle the warmer purple and
then the darker and then the teal is
just extra at the end so I'm gonna try
to do that now I'm taking this lighter
blue shade that's what's on the inner
corner it's the shade
baseline and it's really pretty I put
the glitter glue down and I did use
these foiled
they didn't work that amazing foiled so
I'm not gonna be doing that today I
found that they just weren't picking up
well I just wasn't super happy so I just
made sure I didn't do my face makeup and
I'm gonna just pack these suckers on
with brushes and my fingers they just
they aren't like a highly metallic
formula so they just don't quite foil in
that same way all right so that's the
first color on the lid I'm gonna go
through and just really punch in the
color with my finger because we're gonna
be doing a lot of blending back and
forth between colors so we can get a
nice gradient I'm gonna flip this brush
around we're gonna go in with the
mid-tone purple but it's more of like a
warm purple this is the shade let me
tell you on the rise and that's gonna go
in the center part of the lid um I'm
actually switching it right now I'm
going in with the darker this is too
similar to what we have in the crease so
we're just gonna go darker
and that darker purple shade is called
fault line so what I'm gonna do first
before we go in with the third color I'm
just gonna be building up the gradient
between these two shades I want to kind
of focus more on that more blue
periwinkle color to be more prominent so
I'm gonna be blending that on top of the
purple I think this is looking really
nice so we're gonna move on to the final
color and that is this kind of metallic
teal this is the shade slave fair and
I'm going to be putting this on the most
outer corner into that purple shade and
then we're gonna be blending with a mat
to really bring it home and that is
covering a lot of that purple so I'm
just taking the purple and again just
kind of adding it so we still have that
darker purple in the middle alright so I
think that's looking really cool it's
like really iridescent because these are
all shimmer shades they kind of all have
like especially this purple has like a
slight duochrome to it so it's like
picking up lighter on the lower part of
the lid than the higher part like I
think it just looks really cool and like
a beetle or something now that we have
that all on the eyes I'm gonna go in
with this darker teal this is a matte
and this is the shade formation we're
gonna be putting that on the outer part
of the eye I just want this to go there
so we can have a deeper outer corner but
also like I don't want it to look super
cut Creasy at the at the end of the eye
here so just slightly blending that in
but I think it just adds a little more
dimension and now that we have that on
I'm going back in and just blending out
with the purple into that teal making
sure of course that everything is
blended I also want to use my finger and
just tap in that metallic green shade
just so that way that Matt hasn't
completely covered all the sparkle all
right so far I really like the way this
is looking so I'm going to clean up my
face I'm gonna go and do my foundation
do the rest of my face I'll come back
I'll let you guys know what I use and
then we will work on the details of the
eye look so like the inner corner of the
lashline and also some of those glitter
details
I'll be back okay so we're back just so
you guys know I used Elam asked his
lover on the cheeks for my blush I used
the Too Faced what is this diamond
highlighter as my highlight I used two
Clarins bronzer as my bronzer there'll
be the link down below if you want to
check them out
yeah so let's get in and finish up this
eye look I'm gonna start working on the
lower lash line and to do that I'm gonna
take kind of like a fluffy shader brush
it's not like fluffy it's just fluffy
for a shaker brush if that makes sense
it's not like a flat one and we're gonna
take that first purple we used and we're
really just buffing this underneath the
eye into the outer corner just building
up a nice base for us to put color on
and I'm letting this be pretty blown out
and keeping it toward the outer portion
of the eye and just being softer as we
go in alright now that we have that laid
down I'm gonna go in with one four three
and this small little smudger and we're
gonna be putting the purple along the
whole length of the eye just closer to
the lash line instead of so buffed out
and then to bring in some of that depth
I'm gonna take the matte teal same brush
and just kind of mend it or meld it or
combine it with that outer corner just
on the outer edge so we have it
connected alright now that we have the
lower lash line done I'm gonna go into a
new shade and this is kind of like my
inspiration for the last time
this is j-job ooh it's a really pretty
like chartreuse e green and we're gonna
be putting this on the inner corner and
then we're gonna be bringing it into
that lower lash line I probably will end
up foiling this one but we want it to be
just so bright and stark compared to
everything else like we have some of
those green tones going because of that
teal but nothing in this same vibrancy
and lightness and I really love this
portion of the look I ended up not even
needing to foil it and I think it still
looks really really good and the last
portion for detail is this elf liner
this is in seafoam and it's a glitter
green it's really really pretty so we're
going to first put this on the lower
lash line right at the inner tear duct
and kind of blending out into the purple
this is really gonna make
that greens standout I really love these
liners I think they retail for like $4
and so pretty just to add a touch of
sparkle and shine without getting
glitter everywhere and the other place
we're gonna end up putting this is on
that like line where the purple and blue
meet for that cut crease so it's almost
like the inner corner what a little
sparkle go and we're just doing it half
way and you kind of want the glitter to
be more opaque the line and then as you
get out here just kind of fades off and
this is a bit more delicate than the
line I did in the last one and I think I
like that so I don't want to play with
it too too much and now to try to
emulate that on the other eye all right
so that's what it looks like they got a
little bit thicker
I feel like this line definitely looks
better but overall I think it's so
pretty and I really like the idea of
like that cut crease with it this time
to finish off the eyes I'm gonna go in
with some mascara I'm going to put some
liner on my top lash line I put this
like basically just wiggled into the
lashes on my tight line so I don't put
it on like the actual flap of skin or I
try not to and then I'm gonna put white
on the waterline I might smudge a little
bit of black into this outermost portion
just so it has some depth and then I'll
be right back to show you what that
looks like alright so this is what the
eyes look like all finished I really
really like them I think they're so
pretty for lips I wanted to go really
simple so I'm just using a balm and a
gloss so one of them is the Revlon kiss
lip balm and juicy peach okay I tried
just putting it over I just need to wipe
and then put it on so I'm gonna reapply
this I just hate when my lips look so
pigmented like this but my lips can't
handle all the extra product on them
from like the powder and the foundation
and then I'm gonna be putting a gloss
this is the katie-cat gloss in tabby
tees I just wanted something kind of
coral to match my blush okay
this is the final look up close I'm
gonna zoom us out so you guys can see it
like all together with everything and
then we will get into the swatches
alright guys so here's the final look
out in full view I've really enjoyed
this look I hope you guys enjoyed the
tutorial this was something that I'm
really happy I got a second chance at I
think it turned out better than the
first time and I feel like if I did it
again I would even do it better there'd
be like different things maybe it would
change the look a little bit but I think
it might pop or just have a better
composition but overall I'm super happy
with how this look turned out and yeah I
think that's it so if you want to see
swatches of the color pop festival
eyeshadows the ones that I have in my
collection just stay tuned and we'll get
into swatches other than that thank you
guys so so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
