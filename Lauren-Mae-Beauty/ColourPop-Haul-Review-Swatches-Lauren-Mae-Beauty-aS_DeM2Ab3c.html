lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a color pop hall and
swatch and review video i have not
ordered from colour-pop in years i
ordered right when they first launched
their eyeshadows all they had were
eyeshadows and that was the first time i
ordered the last time ordered obviously
they've come out with so many more
things and Black Friday Cyber Monday and
then I even made another order so this
is three orders something about the
deals and everything was just the right
time the right place so I bought some
stuff I feel like I have a mixed review
on all the different things I god I
really overall I'm excited with what I
purchase and I'm happy and I definitely
want to make more purchases I'm going to
try to keep it under control but let's
just get into the different things I
bought and what I thought about it and
this watch is and we'll go from there so
probably the thing that initiated my
buying in the first place was this quad
I got two different quads from
colour-pop in my first order this is the
peachy keen quad it came with for
eyeshadows I've taken them out but I
wanted to save the packaging to show you
because I thought it was so cute they
were doing a deal where it was like
fourteen eighty or something for that
package so I thought that was great i
just purchased it i went for it the
first shadow that's in there is the
color kennedy and this is a peachy matte
shadow i did use it in my look today I
haven't get ready with me on this look I
will leave it linked down below if you
want to see it in action but it's super
awesome these were these shadows I
wanted to try the most because I thought
that if I could get them to blend out on
a brush these would be so nice and so
pretty to use as crease colors and
transition colors and they work perfect
for me i absolutely love them that's
what it looks like i think it's so
pretty this is basically i feel like
orange soda but in color pop form i am
in love with the mat formulas so if you
were wanting to try them and thought
that they might work for you I
definitely suggest trying them out I
think overall they're really great I've
mostly only tried the lighter colors but
so far all of those have been great
let's move on to other colors in the set
the next color was the color Cornelius
and I do believe this is part of one of
the kathleenlights collections but it
was part of this collection as well so
this is cornelius also a mat and also a
great transition
I've really been enjoying this I find
that it picks up great on my e-40 brush
and I can have a great transition I also
love this all over the eye I just have
really been enjoying it I think it's
super nice so I was really happy with
this one the last two colors are a
little bit of duds I'll go with the next
Matt this is the color bandit and this
color i absolutely love it's like a
really warm brown but i find that this
can be a little tricky to blend out to
get even um I don't know if it's just
this color in general or the darkness of
this or what but this is the only Matt
I've used so far that I can kind of
understand where people feel like they
can't get a good blend on it if you
layer this product more in other areas
it can get like deeper and lighter and a
little patchy looking I don't suggest it
as much as the other mats I stick to
mostly the light ones but I still do
like the color and I can make it work
but these three right here like this is
my color palette totally and the last
color in there was crimper and this is
the color I don't like and I've realized
that basically I like the metallics in
the mats and I hate the glitters I
absolutely hate them this has so much
glitter running through it I just hate
it so much it falls out on my face I
think these are great if you're doing
like a really sparkly fun look but I
just don't see myself using this every
single day I already used it once and I
just didn't enjoy it so i will be
passing this color on but if you love
glitters i mean they are fun and if
you'd like something that's sparkly on
the everyday i just know i won't use it
so overall i think that sets a really
great value for the price i got it for
1480 it was worth it because I saved
technically twenty cents but I
definitely suggest the matte shadows in
there maybe not banned it as much as
other ones but it's still pretty if you
really want that color now we'll move on
to the studio 1400 quad I've really been
wanting this I did put in for it even on
oxalate and get accepted but I have been
really wanting it and again when it was
on the sale I was like okay let's go for
it this also came with foreshadows these
are all metallics and they're really
beautiful i love all of them the first
one here is eight track and this is kind
of a tarnished gold i have worn this and
i really do like it it's a lot deeper
than you expect though I almost
like it kind of has this black base even
though it doesn't but in certain lights
it looks definitely more dark and then
the light will catch it something a
little bit different for me I feel like
makes a really nice smokey eye and I
like blending it out with those more
warm shades from the other quad I think
that is a really pretty look next is the
color white rabbit I've only swatched
the rest of these ones but they're
absolutely beautiful this is a copper
metallic color absolutely stunning no
glitter in any of these which is amazing
I'm so happy about that because all the
glitter man's the glitter just throws me
off metallics are where it's at matts or
where it's at next this is the color
static and this one actually came to me
a little bit broken I did just kind of
press it back in there you can see the
couple cracks it wasn't enough for me to
like make a big deal of it but that was
a little disappointing this one's really
pretty it's a burgundy purple again I
feel like it kind of has that darker
base than you would expect this one
definitely is not as metallic as the
other ones either but it's definitely
really pretty super pigmented I really
like it and the last color is the color
Donna and this is a nice teal color feel
like it's pulling a little more blue on
my monitor but it is like a blue-green
color I just feel like these colors
together are very inspiring i really
like it and i can't wait to make some
really pretty looks with these the
moment I saw these colors I love them so
I'm really happy with that quad I highly
suggest it if you're into those colors
they don't have any glitter if that was
something you were wondering super great
let's move on to the next order i made i
did get something else i think in there
but i think we've got gifts i'm not
really sure i purchased some lip
products from colour-pop these were
things have been really wanting i was
really excited to get them and a couple
of them or most of them are kind of
disappointing so let's get into it I
really want to try the lippie pencil so
I got three of the pencils and two of
the lippie Stix the three that I got
this one is in the color Lion King it's
like a red this one is in the color
dunes and then this is in the color
Aquarius because I am an aquarius and
something that was really disappointing
to me about these is the fact that no
one mentions this I've never heard one
person mentioned the fact that these
freaking land
not stay on these none of mine stay on
they have absolutely no section know
anything so these well I can never use
them in my kit because the lids would
just fall off in about four seconds and
get everywhere and ruin the pencil so
anyway that alone right there packaging
wise they just suck so I don't think
that I could buy any more of these I
really want to i don't think the formula
is bad it's just such a packaging issue
to me that i can't like look past it so
this is the color Aquarius I do really
like this that's what it looks like at
the bottom I do think that the colors
online are a little bit misleading so I
definitely suggest looking at like other
people's watch videos and whatnot just
to get a better idea it's nothing that
would like stop me from buying them but
I don't think like lion king I don't
feel like I would have bought this color
if I knew it look like this but in the
picture online I feel like it looked a
little different but maybe I was just
crazy that's Lion King right there all
of them are really pretty colors again
the formula i think is really nice they
are really nice a matte lip pencil and
great as like a base for colors or even
an all-over lip color and then this one
here is called dunes i do like them
again the shades are nice but this
packaging issue let me know if you have
them that do this I don't know how
anyone could ever use them like I don't
understand that unless they're sitting
in a drawer because there's no way you
can bring that with you to touch up like
I don't it's just useless to mean I
don't understand that so that was really
disappointing I'm glad the products good
but that's so disappointing and these
are the other two lip products that i
bought this one is in aquarius of course
i wanted to get the matching lip pencil
and lippy stick this is what it looks
like this is a cream formula so it's not
supposed to be Matt it has a little bit
of a shine they smell like vanilla and
they're nice they're nothing amazing I
kind of wish that I had got some matte
ones though I didn't get any Matt lippie
Stix it's kind of hard to judge that
part of it because I feel like I would
have preferred am at one and I thought I
would just watch Aquarius in the lip
pencil next to it they're slightly
different shades but in the right way
the lip pencils just a little bit darker
and I think that's something that really
is nice about how colour-pop does their
lip pencils they aren't the same exact
color because they do different
functions if they're the same color it
wouldn't make sense to me and then the
other one that I got is the color pop
and Hello Kitty lippy stick in the color
konichiwa I got this because I saw that
girl shake so so watch this but this is
not the color I really thought it would
be online it's a lot more pink on me and
not as great as I wanted again it's a
cream formula 2 which is fine but I kind
of wish I had gotten mad but anyway
those are fine I definitely think I'll
be getting more lippie Stix in the
future but I'm going to pay attention to
the finish a little bit more and then
something that I thought was really
awesome one of my packages did come a
little bit late and inside of the
package was a little nervous and sorry
we're late and it came with a free
product this is one of the ultra glossy
lips and this is in the color Finders
Keepers and i love that it was an actual
color i feel like i would use this
reminds me a lot of dolly from buxom in
the lip gloss and it's a really pretty
color i'm excited to have this it smells
nice and it's not sticky I used to think
that the buxom ones were not sticky this
formula makes that look so sticky this
is not sticky at all it reminds me of
like the NYX butter glosses so if you're
looking for a non sticky lip gloss I
feel like these would be really good
options now let's move on to my most
recent order I just got this one in the
mail I think like two days ago I decided
to pick up a few more of the matte
shades so as I was going through the
eyeshadows I specifically made sure they
were matte colors that I thought I would
enjoy and like so I picked up for for
myself and then I did pick up again
another Christmas gift the first one
here is the color elixir and this is
right up my alley absolutely beautiful
it feels so velvety soft absolutely love
it and that's what it looks like it's so
pretty it blends out beautifully even
though this is a bit darker it's not
like as dark as bandit the earlier when
I showed you this one has no problems
with building up or Bing patchy the next
shade that I picked up is the color bill
and I wanted to pick up something in
that more ma be purple range as a
transition I really like this it's super
pretty I have not used it but I'm
excited to incorporate it into some
looks I decided to pick up one of the
newer shades this is from the holiday
collection I believe
and this is the color desert and this is
actually a satin formula but I wanted to
try it still because I thought it would
still work as like it all over one
Shadow look and for me this works just
fine as a crease color transition color
and it all over lid color I wore it that
way the other day and I really liked the
way it looked it's nice and warm but not
too warm I feel like it's still kind of
neutral and I forgot I did pick up one
metallic this is the color weenie again
I feel like this is from one of
kathleenlights colors and this is a
metallic it's like a rose gold and it's
absolutely beautiful it's super
pigmented it's watches absolutely
beautiful I did wear this on the eyes
the other day it looks really great and
I'm excited to have it again so happy it
doesn't have any glitter in it no
glitter now as much as I wanted to pick
up the shadows I also was tempted
because they just came out with brushes
and one of the promotions that they were
doing when I made this purchase was if
you bought two shadows you gotta brush
free they have two different brushes
they were offering so I was able to get
one of each I have used both of these
and they work really amazing i'm super
happy with the quality of these the
first one here this is the blending
brush it kind of reminds me of the mac
139 is that the one everyone loves it's
not as dense maybe but it's it's tapered
and fluffy at the same time I've used
this to put stuff into my transition
increase works beautiful with color pop
shadows the one I was most excited about
was the other brush though this is a
flat synthetic brush let me see if I can
give you a better shot of it it's just a
flat synthetic brush and I was hoping
that this could pick up I shadows like
the color weenie let's say obviously
when ice watch this with my finger it
looks beautiful right it looks so
beautiful but we always have the
complaint that with color pop you can't
get it on your eye without you know
using your finger so I put a little bit
on the brush and I'll just sweep it
across there it's absolutely beautiful
you can easily pack this on your eyelid
and not get your fingers dirty and get
the same amount of pigmentation I'm
really happy with this brush I think it
makes colour-pop shadows way more
accessible and usable for a lot more
people I think the two brushes that they
can
always make sense for their products and
I'm really happy that they actually work
in their products if you are wondering
about the brushes I think they're really
great hopefully they're at a good price
point too I think five dollars for them
would be really awesome and they're so
adorable they're like that copper with
the pink you can't beat that overall I'm
super highly impressed with everything I
got and I do think that everything for
the most part was worth it and I'm happy
with the pricing and the quality and
everything I don't suggest the lip
pencils uh just because the packaging is
absolutely horrible and totally unusable
to me so anyway let me know what you
guys think about color pop down below if
you've got any of this stuff if you like
any of it if you don't just anything
about it if you have any suggestions for
me based off of this video and what I
like and what I don't like that would be
amazing I will see you guys in my next
video I hope you're having a wonderful
day and I'll see you bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
