Lauren thank you so so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a review some
swatches and also a demo of the color
pop I think I love you palette this
video is in dedication to Jacqueline if
you guys don't know her I'm leaving her
channel linked down below
I bought this palette as well as the
Natasha Jeannot Lila palette at the same
time and I've been testing that one out
quite a bit and I will have videos on it
soon I just really want to make sure I
like you know know about these palettes
when I'm gonna talk to you guys about
them so I finally abused this enough
that I feel like I can give a nice
review on it
I will show you swatches I also did a
demo with this eye look so that'll be
toward the end anyway let's keep it
short and sweet and let's get into it
yeah I think I love you palette is the
newest shadow palette from colour-pop
this is in their classic now 12 pan form
this is what the colors look like it is
a very pretty fall palette that's what
they've like marketed this as they are
coming out with a collaboration with My
Little Pony and color pop I will most
likely be picking that one up I don't
think I need it but I think it's really
pretty so I'm gonna pick that one up to
probably just a heads up because I know
some of you guys have been asking
overall just to get it out of the way I
think this is a really nice palette I
really like the colors in it do I think
everyone needs this definitely not this
has a lot of basic shades in it how I
think of this palette is someone who
does a very similar eye look every
single day you do like a transition you
do a little bit darker in the outer
corner or the crease and then you do
like a really pretty shimmery lid color
this is the palette for you if that's
what you normally do with your makeup
Belair is a great like transition color
I have this in the single form and I
really do like it this color up here
which I believe is called my type is
great for deepening things up and if you
want to go deeper or if you have a
deeper skin tone and need some more
definition they also have a matte black
in here so I feel like those three alone
can make a really beautiful smoky eye in
so many different ways you could do it
we're deepening up the outer corner and
it's getting smokier and smokier you
could do it where black is all over the
lid and you're blending it all the way
out so those alone I think are so pretty
this color here is called rowdy
and although it looks like it's gonna be
a matte cream it does have like those
glitters kind of shot through it too
this functions as a mat I just blended
all over my lid to set my primer I'll
use it as a brow bone but some people
might not like that so keep that in mind
but I think that's a great addition I
wish it was just cream but for what they
did do it really does help with the
palate and then everything else in here
are just beautiful additions I love that
they have a classic champagne they also
have a really pretty gold if you are
more into that but then they have like a
really fun pop of gold they have this
beautiful shade here which is a more I
don't know it's like this in between
warm and cool tone it reminds me makeup
geeks grandstand that they have a copper
that's more orange they have a more red
based copper this is a more like patina
type of color from Mac and and then they
have this which reminds me of antiqued
from Mac I just think it's a really nice
palette again not everyone needs this
you probably have a million dupes in
your collection but I brought this with
me recently to Arizona and I can do all
my looks from just this one palette
which was really really awesome
something I will say about the formula
of some of these metallics I they're
flaky but they're not necessarily chunky
they don't feel dry they feel very
creamy to the touch but they still are
kind of flaky so this light gold sheet
here this copper one the champagne this
gold as well as this one here are very
highly metallic you'll see it in the
swatches but they are gonna be a little
bit flaky I eat this one when I put this
on my lid today it went on so well
without mac fix+ without anything just
with my brush it went on so pigmented
and well so I don't find that to be a
bad thing I think that the pigmentation
on them is amazing it's just something I
want to point out to you guys so that
you're you know what you're expecting
when you get it home the other three
in here these two as well as this one up
here are a different finish they aren't
quite as metallic as the other ones I
pointed out so just keep that in mind
they're still super shiny and pretty but
they just don't have that same just kind
of like flakiness and if you have this
palette you kind of know what I'm
talking about but again it's not a flaky
dry it still has it feels very soft to
the touch and I wouldn't consider it
like a dry color and it also has a
thinness to it so that's just like a
little swatch there they're insanely
pigmented they're really really
pigmented they're really really pretty
and again for the price to me it's
definitely worth it this one here is
really really pretty I have it on the
center center of my lid today but this
will not be quite as a fake as maybe you
want I think it's pretty as like a
topper and if you foiled it it would be
like so opaque but on its own it's not
like the craziest you know thickest full
pigment shadow the last thing I think I
want to mention I mean I don't feel like
I have too much more to say about this
it doesn't retail for sixteen dollars
you guys probably knew that but I really
like the packaging on this as much as
it's really shiny and so it's hard to
film and also it kind of will get
fingerprints I do think it will be
easier to clean and you can actually get
those things off as opposed to the kind
of like more matte cardboard they've
been doing where as soon as you get
shadow outside of the pan I mean you're
done for it's gonna look super messy
this packaging definitely kind of
remedied that so that's kind of nice it
just doesn't look as dirty but I think
sometimes with metallics like this you
can also see any imperfections a little
bit more so I don't know it's an
improvement overall I feel like to me so
it's just cute though it's just so cute
I love these palettes this one is no
exception I thought at first I wasn't
going to like it when I first got it I
was like oh but the more I've been using
it the more I do think that this has a
place in a lot of people's collection
and again
I think this really targets someone who
loves neutral lips maybe like to them a
red copper is a pop of color and I think
that they would really enjoy this and
they can actually like use this palette
to the ground and use it every single
day so on to swatches I'm going to show
you swatches of the palette and then if
you want to stay tuned for the demo
after that stay tuned and that's
everything guys I'll see you in those
portions in the video
hey guys let's start off with the color
pop palette I obviously have my face
down already I'm gonna leave all of the
products I use down below so you guys
can check them out if you're interested
in anything else that's on my face
already so this is the color pop palette
I'm gonna be going in first with the
shaker Bellaire this is a nice
transition and I'm going in with my e-40
I have you guys zoomed in close so
hopefully that will help I realize I
already have a primer on I did not set
the primer but I did put it on a little
bit ago so I just went in normally what
I've been doing with this palette is
taking the shade here it's like a matte
with glitter throughout it and I have
been putting that down on my lid and
it's working fine I know that won't be
everyone's cup of tea because of that
glitter but I don't find that it makes
too much of a difference for me not to
use it
I can definitely still use just this
palette if I went in somewhere you know
I always love this eyebrow just so much
more so you can see all the individual
hairs I just don't have that same thing
going on on this brow I don't know why
now that I have that down as a
transition I'm gonna be going in with
the other matte brown shade in here this
is the color my type I believe and I'm
going to be putting that on the outer
portion of the eye I'm also going to be
bringing this on the inner portion I
might use a smaller brush for that
though I'm doing a halo eye and I'm
going to be playing with some of the
Gold's in the palette this is like a
really light gold and then this one's a
very like yellow almost greeny gold and
I kind of want to do something with
those but halo and then I was thinking
like a red lip just to give you guys an
idea of where I'm going with this I
really do like this palette I I think
that it's a nice one and I don't think
it's a must-have I don't think everyone
needs it I think a lot of people will
have a lot of these shades but if you're
someone who only wears like these types
of shades I think it's a nice one and
it's so inexpensive which is something
that I love I'm gonna go back in with
the brush we used on with the layer and
just blend out the edges I am having
a bit of a blending issue over here I
don't know why that is because I didn't
do anything that I normally haven't done
with these shadows so I don't know if
it's the primer or just what that is
about but this is also the eye that
always has issues blending so keep that
in mind for the inside I'm just taking a
smaller brush and again going in with
that darker brown and placing that on
the inner corner sorry if I'm talking
super low guys this is like the first
time I've really talked all day and so
my voices well froggy and I'm taking the
other side of this brush and just kind
of making sure there's a nice mix
between the two the inside and outside
and bringing them in all right so first
I'm going to go in with the lighter gold
and that is this one here that is a
called better bitter I understand to be
putting this on the center of the lid
and kind of blending out that was just
me putting it on without any fix+ or
anything just so you guys know I'm just
using that to kind of feather out and
padding the brush that we get a nice
blend next I'm going to just go in with
my finger and this really like yellow
gold I mean a lot comes off so I'm just
going to be patting that I'm always
flipping you guys off but I'm just
patting that in the very center of the
eye why is this just like my good eye
it's just the good eye all right I like
the way that looks I'm just gonna go in
and kind of deepen up this other side
I'm liking the way that looks so I'm
going to tightline with Max Costa reach
I'm also going to bring a little bit of
this on the lower lash line to kind of
warm up the eye since Bellaire and even
the darker shade I know they look
but they're not like crazy warm this is
gonna give it even more work and then as
always I'm gonna go in with a white
liner I find that Costa reach always
makes my eyes look so red no matter what
I do so I'm going to put that on the
waterline for the lower lash line I'm
gonna dust some of Bellaire on my bottom
lash line and join it into the top of
the lid and to keep the gold theme going
I'm gonna put this lighter gold on my
inner corner as my highlight I'm also
gonna go in with this creamy matte shade
and well it's not matte it has that
glitter but it's a cream shade I'm
putting that under the brow bone just to
kind of highlight that area since the
blending cut kind of high up I'm gonna
put some mascara on this one is the
monster big from Lancome and I'm
choosing this because it's gonna give me
quite a bit of volume so I will
definitely see my lashes I want them to
be a little bit more of a statement
they're gonna be just a little bit more
clumpy than if I use something like my
Urban Decay perversion alright and I
noticed that I do have some fallout from
the gold so keep that in mind you might
want to do your eyes first if that's
like a huge deal for you and now let's
just do lips I think I don't know my
goal is to do something read it I just
thought it was kind of like holiday II
but then I also have this color which is
just like kind of more of a peach I
don't know I kinda want to try this one
on this is um baby Kay from nude Stix
it's part of that like kit that I bought
all right I'm gonna zoom out so you guys
can see the final look and you know
hopefully you guys like it alright guys
this is the final look I hope you
enjoyed this video I just wanted to do
kind of like as quick as I could a
review swatches and demo for the I think
I love you palette I do really like it I
think it's nice and if it was something
you were wanting
I think price and how good it is I think
you definitely will get use out of it
but it's definitely not like something
you have to have out of the three that I
have I definitely still suggest the yes
please if you were just gonna get one
because I think the colors are so
different they have a lot of mattes it's
just for the value everything about it I
really like that one but this one if you
think that palette is
really warm or too crazy the colors in
this are definitely more neutral
everyday type of colors you can get some
warmth but it's mostly like really
pretty lit sheets with some matte
creases and transition colors so thank
you so much for watching guys I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
