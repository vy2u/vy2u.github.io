Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a first impression
swatches and demo for you I normally
don't do first impressions but I got
requested to do this and I thought I'd
rather get this up for you guys so you
can decide if you want these or not
sooner rather than later so I will come
back and let you know my full thoughts
on these but for now I thought swatches
at least would be something and the
products that I'm gonna be showing you
guys today are the color pop moonlight
magic I have all of the supernovae
shadows that came in the collection and
I also have all the lip glosses I
couldn't help myself you guys know that
I wanted to pick these up and I told you
my wish this video that they did
actually pick them up so yeah this is
what I have on my face today so at the
end there will be a demo I'm gonna get
into some thoughts really fast we'll get
into swatches and then of course again
the demo talking about the supernova
shadows I did pick up one supernova
shadow before this one is in the shade
UFO and I've used it in a get ready with
me
I believe so I'll leave that link down
below it was a pretty intense
experimental look so just keep that in
mind but I wanted to try this out so
I'll leave that linked and I've only
used it that one time so this is
definitely a very first impressions but
I feel like they performed the same this
is a bit more opaque than a couple of
the colors I used today but overall
these are gonna give your lids very
hyper metallic shiny almost glittery
look it definitely does add some texture
it's nothing that I don't like but if
you are someone who wants really smooth
lids this is not gonna give that to you
I mean they're like super glittery
holographic things they're meant to get
attention and they definitely do tend to
look a little bit textured I find the
more product you put on the more
textured it's gonna look these also do
dry down so that's something that I
really enjoy about it I have not gotten
much fallout with these since I've been
wearing them the times that I have which
is really nice and specifically I do
suggest the moonlight magic collection
out of like the one that I have tried
because I feel like these are cool these
are the type of products that I enjoy
they're duochrome they're glittery
there's something different and fun
about them I lighted two different
colors for my eye look today and I just
it came out really spectacular really
pretty and it makes it look like I tried
really hard did something really crazy
and I didn't I just like put on too
little cream shadows so if you're
looking for something spice if your
makeup game or do something fun I do
suggest these I think they're really
great these do retail for seven dollars
each which I think is a really fair
price for the quality and the colors and
everything about them so overall with my
experience so far I do suggest them I
think that great when it comes to lip
glosses these cost six dollars a piece
and I do really like these as well I
have two colors that I had previously
that I thought were kind of similar
this one is Ponyland from the color pop
in my little pony collection and then
this one is the shade tight fit which
you guys have seen me used in a lot of
my different videos I like both of these
and I feel like these are very similar
formula they have a very glittery look
to them the one I have on my lips right
now is my forte and it definitely is
pretty sheer but that duochrome comes
through which is like a lavender with
like a blue almost green shift to it's
really cool
this one is not sticky you can feel the
glitter a bit but I can also feel like
glitter in the Ponyland one so that
wasn't something new to me so if you
really like lip glosses if you like
something fun and glittery like this I
think you would enjoy these as well if
you were trying to decide between the
supernova shadows or the lip glosses a
hundred percent recommend the supernova
shadows over the lip glosses I think
they're more interesting I think they're
just better and different and something
that other brands maybe aren't offering
especially at that price point so real
fast going back to here I will do the
swatches but I'm gonna just give you
some suggestions I mean honestly I think
all of these are absolutely stunning and
beautiful I'm wearing the shade over
again on my lids this is so pretty it's
like a purpley pink with a golden shift
to it but it also has a bit of like
almost violet blue I mean they just have
so many different shifts this one is the
shade now or never' which is a really
pretty like topi pink this one I find
doesn't have a ton of duochrome to it
but it's just stunning like it's such a
pretty lit a fire just just one I think
this is the coolest this is the
Lucky Penny and this is a white but it
just it takes on like so many colors I'm
hopefully gonna be able to get some
swatches in sunlight so I could
hopefully show you some of the duochrome
aspects of these colors but it's so
pretty I think depending on what shadows
you put it over it'll definitely change
the look too so I think you can get the
most wear out of this I will say from
swatching this dusting the most I guess
chunky and glittery so if you get this I
think it will be best used as a topper
shade and I would probably like apply to
your fingers and then tap onto your lid
just to avoid any chunking I mean you
know play around with it and I'm still
gonna play around with it but this is
the one color wise that I think is the
most different I guess I'll just finish
these off the last two I have are from
the valley this one I think is sold out
on the website currently this is very
similar to like makeup geeks
kaleidoscope it's like a grey with a
pink and it's pretty I like it it's not
my favorite one though like I'm glad to
have it don't get me wrong but you know
if I were gonna help you pick something
and you have similar taste of mine I
would let that one go and then this one
on the end is Prelude and this is a
peachy golden pink this is probably one
of the most wearable ones that I think
people would enjoy when it comes to do
Chrome's where they can go a little bit
out of their comfort zone but it's
nothing too insane alright so those are
my thoughts overall I think they're
really nice I'm really excited to use
them I haven't had anything that really
causes me any concern using them in the
first time but again I'll let you guys
know my thoughts coming up and let's
move on to swatches and then again if
you want to stay for the demo that will
be at the end and other than that I'll
see you guys
all right hi guys let's get into the
demo for this look I'm really excited to
be using these supernova shadows I'm
pretty sure I'm going to be using these
two colors today this one is the shade
over again I'll swatch it for you even
though you've probably already seen
swatches it's a really pretty pink
duochrome
I am excited about that one and then the
other one I am going to be probably
using on the inner corner is Lucky Penny
which is an interesting name this one is
super duochrome
really crazy bright probably the like
most interesting cool one out of all the
shades I'm gonna be pulling from two
different eyeshadow palettes to make the
base of this look so first up I'm going
to set my primer I'm just using this
from the Too Faced natural matte palette
and of course I forgot to zoom in so I'm
gonna zoom you guys in really fast you
guys can see the eye look in detail
since we're not doing the rest of the
face or anything since it's already done
alright we're zoomed in nice and close
now for a transition today I'm gonna be
going into my Smashbox palette first
this is the ablaze palette and I'm gonna
be taking this shade here it could work
for a lot of people I just there like
lid setting shade but for me I'm pretty
fair and this this is a little bit
darker so it's a very light transition I
currently have this product in a project
pan so I'm trying to use up as much of
it as I possibly can so that's why I've
been trying to incorporate it into as
many looks as possible next we're going
back to the natural matte palette I'm
gonna be taking the shade honey butter
which is this one here it's just like a
light peachy Brown and I'm just gonna be
deepening up that shade we're sticking
to pretty light in pink today and that's
just what I have been enjoying so yeah I
just I love pink guys I just say really
fast like my eyebrows I feel like look
really good today
I'm very much into them now that we have
that done we're going back into the
Smashbox palette you don't have to use
both of these these are just the ones I
wanted to use today but we're going in
with the pink shade here it's like a red
color I'm taking an e 40 brush but this
one is a little bit less fluffy and
we're going to be keeping that on the
outer portion of the eye and
bringing it a little bit in because
we're gonna have a bit of a cut crease
moment with the shadows so yeah keeping
it mostly to the outer portion though
and I'm just making sure that when I do
bring it into this inner portion I'm
like feathering it in so nothing too
harsh is happening I don't want this
pink to take over too too much and then
to really define that outer corner I'm
going in with the same color but I'm
going to be using a different like
angled brush to really just pack some
color on that outer portion of the eye
all right and the same color I'm going
in with an even smaller blending brush
this one is from ELF and I'm just going
to be focusing just color on that inner
portion so we get a nice like again cut
crease situation oh I'm so excited I'm
so excited to use these so I'm gonna
take the pink one which again is the
shade over again and we're gonna be
putting this on the lid I'm just going
straight in with the applicator though I
do have a flat stiff brush to like help
blend out the edges I find that these do
dry pretty fast and when they set
they're pretty set so you want to work
with it pretty fast definitely like one
eye at a time and whatnot so yeah I'm
gonna go in I'm going to try not to
cover up what I'm doing and there we go
beautiful
I do have a little bit of the product
like picking up here so I'm going to go
over with a second coat and hopefully
that'll kind of remedy that
I don't even think you need the stiff
brush honestly if you just like kind of
feather it out with the doe foot once
there's not as much product on I think
you'll be fine
I hope that I'm in focus that I think I
look so pretty so excited about that I
do think I'm gonna go in though and add
like mmm I think I'm gonna go in with
this one and just kind of add some of
this to like the center of the eye and
just add even more just a little bit
brighter
I just think this is so pretty I really
like it okay so now that I have those on
I'm gonna let them dry and just look
down and then we're gonna go in and
define the outside a little bit more
since this is a little bit darker than I
was like kind of expecting for this eye
look I need to have something a little
bit more defining on the outer edge so
once is this dry we'll be back all right
so it's pretty dry I'm gonna go in now
and I'm going to be taking this matte
Brown the darkest Brown here and we're
just gonna be kind of just a little bit
I just want a little bit more definition
on the edges so um we're gonna go first
of all go on with this one actually
we're gonna go with this actually and
then we'll add that a little bit later
so I didn't go in with the brown I just
went in with that red shade and I really
like it I don't think I need anything
else so I'm gonna go under the eye with
just whatever is left over on the brush
and then for the inner corner I'm just
taking some of the white shade and I'm
putting it on the back of my hand
and I'm gonna go in and just kind of
buff this so it's not as intense on the
inner corner this color has so many
different reflex in it but it tends to
pick up more cool tones so you guys know
and I'm gonna bring that pink in just a
little bit closer
all right guys are almost done I do have
a bit of fallout so I'm gonna go in with
the white shade in here and just try to
brush it away I always like to move any
powders on my face with other powders
they tend to move better and not stick
as much I'm gonna go in and line my
waterline with a white liner and this
one is from colour-pop and then I'm also
gonna go in and put some mascara on and
then I will show you guys the final
looks all right so I have the eyes done
and I love them I think they're so
pretty
so now it's time to pick a gloss I think
I'm gonna go with the pink one I just
have a lip balm on now so I don't know
how much color this is gonna give but
hopefully it'll give some purpley reflux
oh yeah
intergalactic
and just you guys know the color that I
used was my forte that's what I have my
lips it's kind of making my teeth look
yellow but I kind of like it with the
lip we'll see how I'm gonna keep it on
alright guys I hope you enjoyed this
kind of short sweet video I know I don't
normally do first impressions but I
thought if I gave you some swatches and
a demo at least if you guys like the
colors you guys can make a decision and
then I will definitely get back to you
guys and let you know my thoughts on
these whether it's through favorites
videos or tutorials or whatever else so
far I really like them I'm really happy
with my purchase I think these are a
great way to kind of get a really
extravagant look without doing too much
and that's always awesome so let me know
if you're gonna pick these up or if you
have what your thoughts on them are down
below so other people can know some
other reviews and that's everything
thank you so so much for watching guys
and I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
