Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is just going to be a quick review and
swatch video of the color Bob shadows
that I picked up I've been wanting the
pressed powder eyeshadows from
colour-pop since they released I've been
seeing so many great reviews on them and
I'm a single shadow girl I really I just
love eye shadows let's get real but I
really like having Zee palettes and
picking the shades you want I think
that's just awesome
so I was really excited for this release
when they came out with duo's for
Valentine's Day that's when I got sucked
in I thought the colors are really
pretty I said they were limited edition
and we're gonna come back or they didn't
know when they'd come back lies lies
anyway so these are them here I have
them just in a little Z palette I took
mine out of the duo's and I don't even
remember which duos I bought but they
aren't selling them in twos anymore but
you can get them in singles so don't
worry guys so it doesn't even matter
a little rant I'm just gonna go into the
ranch first it's really frustrating to
me like literally I'm gonna do some John
cookie and work right now and I'm gonna
go check the freaking Instagram of
colour-pop I'm gonna do it so I can tell
you exactly what they said about those
freaking duos I found one it said five
new deals $10 each and mini kits 18
launching tomorrow they kept talking
about the duo's the duo's okay
this is what it says Jules are going
fast Limited Edition and limited
quantities we will not restock free
domestic shipping blah blah blah blah
blah right
I mean I guess it's true they're not
coming back into the little duo's and
their little containers but the shadows
literally okay let's get some dates I'm
so sorry guys so they said that on
February 8th I went and purchased my
stuff one of the duo's has already sold
out and I was like okay then twenty new
singles coming at you Valentine's Day
singles plus ten brand new shades
tomorrow that was five days ago and it's
like the 18th I think today
only how many days later on the 13th or
whatever that is they came out with the
single so I could have waited and only
about the ones that I wanted that
weren't paired up in duo's for the same
price it's not even like they were in a
cheaper price and they were gonna do oh
they were still ten dollars and their
five dollars piece I just find that that
is very misleading obviously again the
duo's in the packaging and all that
aren't back but the exact same shades
are they did come out with a single zone
so I just find that that's kind of shady
and the thing is I do like them I like
the colors I got I think they're
pigmented I think their quality
especially for five dollars a pop so I
think it's irritating that so many
brands have to fall back on the fact
that something's limited-edition instead
of just the quality of a freakin crap
like I think these are good like why
couldn't you just not try to like scare
everyone and sell it that way like I
just don't understand why you would try
to do your customers dirty okay
anyway anyway let's just get into the
review overall I think these are really
nice I do like them this is the only one
that wasn't a part of the Valentine's
Day collection it's paper tiger I saw so
many people with this and I just thought
it was so pretty so I had to get it I'll
do like a couple swatches just like
right here for you guys so here are some
swatches of a couple colors I think that
overall pigmentation again for the price
is pretty damn good I was really happy
with it I used these and I look a couple
videos back everyone really liked it so
I will be doing a tutorial on it I'm
definitely not disappointed I will
probably pick up some more they are a
little powdery so if you have issues
with that I don't think you would like
these a ton but again I don't know I
stand by them I think that the quality
is really nice I'm really happy that
they're doing powder products I think
the colors are on trend I like for the
most part the finishes there were two
colors that I didn't like because they
have like a glitter shot throughout them
and I don't know if it was me it was
probably me because I just went and
bought them all you can see it see all
that glitter I'm not down with that
either make it matte or make it a
shimmer but don't do that and the other
one that has the same thing is called
pretty cruel this shadow would be so
pretty by itself without all the shimmer
I've you
I do like them still again if I was
buying the singles uh hmm I wouldn't
have bought those too
other than that though I think they're I
think they're pretty good I don't feel
like these are revolutionary or the most
amazing thing ever but I do think
they're good quality I think that their
color selection they're coming out with
is very good and I like that they are
focusing on mattes
I think that overall if you were wanting
to try them I think you should try them
I think they're good so for me
personally on these I don't ever see
myself having like the full collection I
just don't feel the need but I
definitely feel like I will be buying
like specific shades as they come out or
interesting shades as they come out I
feel like all the reviews I saw from
bigger youtubers about these that they
got sent
I think we're truthful most of them
didn't like those blue shades so I'm
just not never gonna pick those up let's
get into swatches hope you guys enjoyed
this review I hope it was helpful if you
were kind of on the edge there nothing
special and I really don't think you
should rush out and buy them like if you
don't have the money right now just wait
until you do or a special occasion or
something like that or good deal like if
they're doing like 20% off or something
don't get caught up in something being a
limited edition with color pop it's
probably gonna come back like it
probably is and even if it isn't you can
live like you'll totally be fine
excuse my rant at the beginning but I
really it's just irritating right that
should be a whole tube talk situation
talking about some limited edition not
so limited edition stuff I suppose I was
in the case I probably wouldn't have
bought these at the time I did and I
definitely went about the duos because I
didn't want all the shades I would have
just been able to cherry pick the ones I
actually wanted which would have been
better I still bought them so it's like
my fault I'm just saying I think that's
just a little misleading a little shady
anyway let's get into swatches I will
see you guys in my next video I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
