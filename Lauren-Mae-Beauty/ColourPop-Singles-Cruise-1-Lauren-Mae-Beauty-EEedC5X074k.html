Lawrence thanks so much for watching in
my most recent palate bingo where I was
collabing with L which I will leave a
link down below the other checked it out
I talk to you guys about wanting to do
something with my color pop shadows and
I didn't know what I wanted to call it I
just know I want to get more use out of
my super shocked ones you know the ones
the ones that aren't powder but they're
not occurring what are they I really do
like those shadows and i bought some
recently and i really haven't been
getting the use out of them that i want
to so i figured if i started a series
where i was using those products i would
use a more inspired hopefully you guys
to use and more i know a lot of people
have the same complaint that they love
them and they're beautiful but they just
don't use them a lot of these guys in
the comments we're talking about doing
life two singles cruise which emily noel
started and then Tory from biohazardous
beauty also did them and I was tempted
to call it that but the only thing is I
don't know if I want it to be like where
I select random eyeshadow i kindly just
want to come up with my own look like I
don't want it to necessarily be a
surprise I want to like enjoy it and
come up with maybe everyday wearable
looks or you know just stuff like that
hopefully that make sense so I'm going
to call the singles cruise even though
it's not a singles cruise I'm not like
picking out of bags or anything but i do
have for eyeshadows that I want to use
and I think that's going to be like my
rule for the series is that I have to
pick for color pop I shadows and a half
to incorporate them into a look and then
hopefully I can do these like hopefully
once a month or so and I can try to just
get some use come up with different
combinations and then hopefully be
inspired in different ways to use these
shadows i will show you guys what colors
I picked first and swatch and students
can see my color palette I am going to
be doing like a lip swatch and we're
test video later so I wanted something
that was kind of neutral every day I've
really been enjoying like almost a one
eye shadow look lately including us a
little bit darker on the whole list and
I'm used to but I feel really enjoying
it so this isn't going to go on the lid
but the first shot of i have here this
is static and that's a flock of it there
to serve really deep burgundy color this
isn't really simple one this is the
color glow and it's just a mac cream I
was going to use this all over the lid
as a base let's watch a bit on the top
go find the orange swatch I forgot
erase that and I'm just going with it
next for like a crease transition this
is desert and I really like this this is
a great one for just all over the lid as
well it just has a subtle Sheen to it
that's it there this was a part of their
2017 holiday collection but that time I
feel like it's permanent I don't know I
can't stay up to date with color pop and
what's permanent and what's not in last
is the color weenie which i'm sure a lot
of you guys have the really popular one
it's one of the ones with kathleen life
it's so pretty i love it because it's
like really metallic but it doesn't have
glitter in it which is what I'm talking
about that's my color palette for
Tuesday I mean let's get started the
first thing I'm going to use is the glow
shade and I'm going to put that all over
my lids to my brow bone I have already
set them with a primer but I just want
to kind of cancel out any color and just
give myself a nice space plus I wanted
to use the shade and I feel like using
your finger is sometimes the easiest
disease especially since I don't need a
lot of control do you guys wonder its
color pop will ever come up with like
foundations like they're gonna have like
these cushion foundations watch I have
that done already so we're already down
one shade I'm going to take my pigma I
admit my Sigma e-40 and I'm just going
to go straight into desert I do have a
clean brush for this and i highly
suggest with oh my gosh this plane but i
haven't suggest any of the colour-pop
shadows that you're going to use that
you don't use dirty brushes that you use
powder on because i do find that they
tend to dry out the shadow and that
sucks so I'm just popping with a nitrous
to give us a nice transition I mean this
is going to be a really simple I look I
just want to use these more I'm a fan of
the matte shades I know a lot of people
aren't but I think they work really nice
this one is in business of savage but I
like them I know so many people hate
them let me know what to make a paper
metallic shades and I don't have glitter
in them I'm trying to make these more of
a wearable thing not like a little going
out clubbing for my 21st birthday and
that's the only time you wear because I
don't go to bars I don't go clubbing I
don't do any of that ever so it's just
not realistic and I just personally like
loose glitters I'm going to put glitter
on or like a glitter liner
splitter in a shadow I'm feeling pretty
good about the crease right now so I'm
going to go in with weenie this is the
lid shade and I am gonna be using the
color top brushes because I really do
like them just in general and on top of
that I do think they work nicely with
the shadows so I am taking the doesn't
have a name on it but it's like the flat
shader brush and I'm just going to be
packing the color weenie all over the
lid if you really don't like putting
your fingers in your shadow and you want
something that's going to get those
metallic shades onto the lid if I you
touching them I highly suggest this
brush and they're very reasonably priced
on the website as well and i think i'm
going to try to like not only use four
shades but only do color pop so that way
you know I'm really forcing myself to
get creative I don't know we'll see okay
sometimes it's nice to have a powder but
yeah that's it and I didn't use my
fingers at all tours this look like I
applied everything using the brush now
this means our clean brush before I put
it into the darker shade I'm just going
to blend out any harsh lines I might
have ok I'm ready to go in with the
color static that's what it's called I'm
going to be putting my brush in there I
capped it off by habit but you really
don't need to and we're just deepening
up this outer corner and I'm just going
to try to slowly build this up if you
are not a fan of like shimmers and
you're not going to like this look
because it's very shimmery just all
around but I kind of have even been
liking that like almost bringing that
shimmer pretty far out I don't know why
kind of like dislike sultry kind of
messy look I've really been licking it I
feel good how that looks I think it's
the event hopefully I'm gonna go back in
with weenie and just brighten up the
inner portion of the lid and just kind
of blend it out into that static color
and then overall I'm just going to go
back in with my desert brush my be 40
and just blend out anything that might
be there this is a really basic look but
I kind of think the shimmers what adds
something a little bit different to it I
also did my eyebrows different today let
me know how you like them I just used a
brow gel I didn't use pencil I didn't
like sculpt anything I just covered what
i already had with
romola brow gel in it I mean it looks
pretty good like I feel like it was way
faster and looks almost the same so let
me know what you think for the lower
lash line I want to keep it really
sultry and really just like a very
similar look but on the bottom so I'm
going to go and what we me and my little
short shader you guys know like a smudgy
brush I don't know how this is going to
pick a product in lay it down but we'll
see I'm just trying my best to lay this
product on the lower lash line it's not
really working well and I'm bringing it
pretty far in and then closest to the
outer part of the I'm going to go on
with static and just kind of mimic what
we did on top I'm going to be testing
out in the series definitely different
brushes that work with these shadows
because I think the one that they put
out do but like this is definitely not
fun and I am going to go in and just try
to brain up the inner corner using the
original first shade we use bring a
little bit of light to that portion you
might want to use a smaller brush but
this is all I have I'm going to go in
now with my liners this one is from pop
beauty in the colored bronze bonanza and
this is my stila white Kajal eyeliner
next I'm going to put my pure fully
charged mascara on and then I'm also
going to be putting on a liquid lipstick
but I'm tell me what's up a video for
that so yours will see that at some
point I don't know what I'm going to do
but I will be back these are from em
cosmetics so look out for that video and
I was back to show you the final look
okay guys i am back with my final look I
have a mascara on I have my lips done
and this is it i hope you guys enjoyed
this color pop tutorial that's going to
be going on soon on my channel again let
me know if you have any other names
besides noodles crews just because i
feel like this isn't really a singles
cruise that's the only reason I didn't
want to do that from the original video
i did but if you have a different name
made me let me know or anything like
that any ideas on it i'm still kind of
trying to totally flush out this idea so
thank you so much for watching guys I
will see you in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
