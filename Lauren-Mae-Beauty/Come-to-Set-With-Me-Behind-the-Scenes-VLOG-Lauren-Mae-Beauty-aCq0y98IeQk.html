the morning it's 4:23 and I am going to
be on set I just drove like an hour and
a half up north to be on set today so I
thought I would take you with me I'm
going to try to vlog at the best I can
but I am working I've had a few of you
guys request this so that's it for now I
need to go chat in and then I will
hopefully show you more as the day goes
on
the Sun has finally come up but it is
SuperDuper cold I'm trying to show you
guys around I have dirt all over me on
my hands because as you guys saw it's
kind of like a dirty look and I touch I
know that's the crew and this is what I
look like when I get ready at 2:00 in
the morning to be on set my eyebrows are
looking like hella dark anyway I don't
know what you guys saw and I'm being
quiet because I feel really awkward I'm
like off to the side here it's freezing
cold and my hands are so so so so so I
was cold I had to get ready in the dark
yeah I was kind of intense we're doing
one other like a shoot today
and then we are shooting tomorrow like a
night scene so yeah this is like a
little commercial type thing so there's
no sound which is awesome so we can like
talk a little bit and we don't have to
be like super super quiet like you do on
other sides which is nice it's more
about location and and cool shots and
stuff so yeah we'll check in a little
later I'll show you the next location
and hopefully I'll get a little cleaned
up because I look insane
all right wardrobe teams we are out
location two and we're doing like a gun
so it was kind of dirty makeup again
sadly I can't film while I'm actually
getting people makeup makeup but I will
try to like insert photos that I take so
you guys can kind of see what it looks
like and I will also try to like link
this at some point when I get the
footage back or when it's a edited thing
I don't know how I feel about myself in
a hat I feel like I look so strange but
I'll show you guys a little bit around
give you a tour I'll show you guys my
set back too so you can kinda see what
I'm bringing on set with me since we're
in like special crazy locations I like
to kind of keep it as mobile as possible
so that way I don't have to worry about
anything and it'll have a ton of stuff
to lug around yeah
I also brought bug spray that's
something make it that I added for this
shoot and it's already come in handy
we've already used it two hits though
that was a good one I thought I would
just mention here anyway the worst
lighting possible is that better
well that's a little better but now I
look like I'm in like a dump or
something so yeah let me know if you
guys like this type of video if you want
me to try to do it for more sites like I
can't do it for pilots or Ike I have to
sign you know confidentiality things but
for other things I can try to vlog and
let you guys see what it's like on set
okay yeah I'll give you a little bit of
tour this is day one I might upload
these in second part or separate parts
just to get something up I know I
haven't talked to you guys on forever
it's cuz I've been real sorry as you
guys know I got up insanely early today
to get to set so that we could have
those awesome shots of the sunrise and I
got off a set late last night so I got
maybe three hours
yeah I think I'm gonna show you guys
around and I'll update you guys a little
bit later
there's the kit it looks crazy because I
have everything in here so at my
umbrella for when it's really hot down
here in this pocket is one of the bug
sprays I actually condensed down this is
just all the makeup I have really really
simple stuff and then for the effects
today I just put this in here so it was
easy and I kept it contained but I have
stuff to get people dirty as well as
make people look sweaty so just let me
know if you guys want to see a tutorial
on how I make people look dirty
for film I'll do that for you
alright guys I wanted to update you
because obviously I am in my house now I
think we wrapped about I don't know
12:30 are probably one we wrapped at one
so that was a pretty long day it wasn't
12 hours which was nice but since it was
such an early call time it was kind of a
lot you guys haven't checked out my
Instagram than you should because I try
to post pictures on there of like things
I'm doing as well as just things in my
life so you can always check out my work
over there but I think I'm gonna leave
the vlog today here I'm gonna try to
edit this and actually upload it today
we'll see how that goes so it'll be in
real time I feel so bad because I
haven't had a video up in a really
really long time and I'm sorry guys it's
just been crazy
you can tell probably from this video or
hopefully from this video I am gonna try
to record tomorrow and vlog that so this
will be part 1 and then tomorrow will be
part 2 I will try to get some of my
actual like filming and like just try to
get like my setup maybe or some
different things but hopefully this is
interesting let me know if you guys like
this again and other than that I'm going
to bed guys I'm gonna sleep it's gonna
feel so so good I think from the last
three days or so I've only had about
like ten hours of sleep I just got off a
two day short film right before this so
I was filming Saturday I still make
Sunday and then you know today's Monday
and then tomorrow so so let me know what
you think down below and I will see you
in tomorrow's vlog it should be cool
we're doing some night stuff with like
fire and some like witches and that's
gonna be cool it's gonna be a girl
alright I look horrible throughout this
entire vlog so forgive me and hopefully
some sleep will do me well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
