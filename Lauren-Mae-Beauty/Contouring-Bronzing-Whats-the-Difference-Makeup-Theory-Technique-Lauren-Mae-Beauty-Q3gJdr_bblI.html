Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk about contouring
and highlighting and bronzing and the
differences and more in a teaching way I
guess and just like an understanding
this is almost like a class so I hope
you guys enjoy that I'm also going to be
talking about different products that I
use at the end and brushes and whatnot
and that's gonna be from what I do
personally and also what I do on clients
I am NOT gonna be demoing anything in
this video I didn't want to get super
long and honestly it's like I have so
many different videos where I'm doing
similar things where I'm talking about
this so check out my get ready with me
check out other tutorials and just
different things I just did a video with
like a Clarins like bronzer and all that
so if you guys want to check that out I
feel like if that might be helpful if
you just want to see how I apply things
but I honestly feel like we see people
apply bronzer and contour in the areas
we know we know the three we know you
know the cheekbones and the nose and the
temples and under the jawline but I feel
like it's more important to have
understanding and knowing what you're
doing why you're doing it and then if
you understand that you can change up
the rules to fit your face to fit your
skintone and if you want break the rules
and do whatever you want but know why
you're doing it and I think that's
really important and just having that
background knowledge and understanding
can help you just make more informed
decisions when it comes to your makeup
and what you want to do artistically or
correctively or anything like that
I of course wrote out notes because I
wanted to stay as organized as possible
in this video so I'm gonna leave
timestamps of like products because
we're gonna get to that at the end let's
talk about contouring I'm gonna talk
briefly on highlighting but it's more
about the contour aspect so contouring
is just enhancing the face shape with
makeup that's all it is it's a very
broad definition but that's what you're
essentially doing when you contour and
there are actually two different ways
you can kind of contour or reasons
you're contouring one is just enhancing
the natural face shape that you have
because everyone's face shape is
different um everyone's bone structure
is slightly different
and then there is corrective contouring
which is different because you are
taking what natural features you have
and instead of enhance
just those you are changing them so
you're making them look like optically
different with the makeup and the
placement that you're choosing and a lot
of us do that as well there's nothing
bad with that but those are kind of like
the two different ways and as a makeup
artist when I look at someone's face
those are what I take into account so if
someone already has really great you
know cheekbones and jaw structure and
all that
I'm just enhancing with the contour what
they have whereas if someone has a
really round face or let's say they have
a shorter forehead or a larger forehead
I'm going to be using contouring maybe
in a different way to enhance or bring
out features that maybe are not as
prominent or to balance out other
features that they have so it's just a
bit more corrective so some general
rules of thumb when it comes to
contouring the products you're gonna be
using is going to be about two to three
shades darker than your actual skin tone
and then it's kind of the opposite with
highlighter you want something that's
two to three shades lighter than your
skin tone when it comes to contour you
also do want something that is matte
because when it comes to highlighting
and contouring highlighting is bringing
forth features and then contouring is
kind of bringing those features back and
having them recede and so similarly with
matte products those are not going to be
catching the light because I don't have
any reflective pigments in them so
that's going to help with the illusion
that that area of the face is more
sunken in or receding whereas when we
have a highlighter either whether it's a
lighter in tone or has a shimmery
pigment or both those are going to again
enhance the fact that that part of the
face is coming out or catching the Sun
another rule of thumb at least that I
hear all the time on YouTube is that you
want a really cool toned contour color
and although that can be the case I
think something that gets lost in this
kind of like generic YouTube world is
that color is relative so putting a
color on someone's skin tone and putting
that same color on someone else's skin
tone is different the colors look
different they translate differently and
so color is relative and so you can't
just apply blanket rules to every skin
tone and to every person and so when I
think of different skin tones this is
how I look at it so for lighter skin
tones you're gonna want to be very
careful of going with anything too dark
and you want to pay attention to
undertone I feel like anyone
the lightish range you are someone who
would want something that is a bit more
cool tone that's in the taupe family you
want to stay away from things that pull
too orange or pull too red
because they're going to really stand
out on your fair skin if you have a
lighter skin tone - you are really
relying on the contour instead of the
highlight because you're already so fair
you know depending on where you're on
the spectrum of course but it's harder
to highlight something that's already
really light so you're using the
deepness of a contour to add that
dimension into the face so this is where
I would say definitely stick to
something more cool toned definitely
stick to something that's going to
flatter your own skin tone as well and
just look out for undertones of like
orange and red you don't want anything
to pool really too warm or one way or
another you want it to look more natural
and so something light using light hands
and not having those really strong
undertones okay moving on to medium tan
skin tones if you're in this range you
are lucky because you can use so many
different products this is where having
something cool tone doesn't necessarily
apply I find that when I'm doing makeup
on other people I can use my bronzer in
a way where I can kind of bronze the
skin up but also use it as a contour the
warmer in your skin tone is the warmer
you can go with your contour if you have
a really warm skin tone and you go in
with like a super cool toned gray
contour it's gonna look ashy it's gonna
look dead it's not going to look
flattering and so that's where you kind
of want to like throw out rules if
you're following those rules and not
finding any success again that color is
relative like that same color doesn't
translate the same on every like all the
different skin tones and all the
different undertones so you have a lot
more range I would definitely play
around with what you like
basically just sticking to having
something three shades darker or two to
three shades darker than your skin tone
something that's matte it may be more
neutral to start off with but you can
find your own preference find what you
want and your bronzer might be deep
enough to give you the type of structure
that you want with your face with that
powder so and then we get into darker
skin tones and I have a product that I
will show you for how to contour but I
think more than
anything this is kind of the opposite of
lighter tone so you already have a lot
of darkness on the face the skin is
already super pigmented so you're going
to be playing with the highlights to
kind of reverse contour and that's how
you can get a lot of dimension and a lot
of shape back to the face now again
there's a spectrum of you know skin
shades so that might not apply for
everyone but if you are finding it hard
to either find a contour color or you
know nothing's quite dark enough I would
definitely play around with highlighting
certain areas and bringing out that
contour naturally just like you would
with a lighter skin tone do the opposite
and you wouldn't necessarily highlight
as much you would just use the contour
only almost if you are gonna contour I
would definitely stick to things that
are not too light or ashy that are deep
enough another kind of tip and something
that I think makeup artists and just if
you only do your own skin tone it's hard
to keep in mind but you need to meet
saturation with saturation so like if
you have a lighter skin tone you can go
lighter with your eye shadows and your
bronzer and all these things because
your saturation is very light and so you
don't need a lot to show up but if your
saturation is darker if you have a
deeper skin tone then you have to match
that with something that's equally as
saturated if you don't have something as
saturated it's not it's going to look
ashy it's going to look powdery I feel
like sadly as makeup artist if you
aren't someone of color if you aren't a
person of color and you don't have that
experience that can be kind of the
makeup artist hardest thing to kind of
have this learning curve because again
colors are relative and so you think oh
this lighter shade or this is dark on me
so this will work perfect and then you
put it on different skin tone and you
see the difference you're like whoa holy
cow I didn't realize that this wasn't
warm enough and that this does look ashy
and so practice just practice practice
practice if you are working makeup
artist if you're aspiring makeup artist
if you're just learning definitely
practice this see colors next to each
other and get your eye trained for that
I think it will help so much and it
makes me sad so much that there are so
many women of color and men of color who
will come with their makeup party done
because they've been burning away too
many times from makeup artists who don't
understand color theory or don't have
the correct products in their kit and I
really think that as makeup artists you
should be able to work on anyone who
sits in your chair this is a product I
like to use for people who have really
dark skin tones this is actually a blush
from Mac it's called film noir it's a
matte again you're using this very very
lightly and you can always build up but
this is going to give depth without
looking ashy it has that saturation to
it it has this kind of like reddish
undertone but more than anything I don't
want something that's going to look ashy
so this works really well and I like to
mostly keep that to like the cheekbones
where you want the most depth alright so
let's go back to the second form of
contouring which is corrective
contouring and we see this a lot on
YouTube this is when you are adding some
like contour to the bottom of your lip
to make your lower lip look fuller or if
you are really chiseling out your
jawline because you maybe have some
double chin edge or you're really
slimming out the nose or stubbing the
nose like if you have a really long nose
if you put some contour at the end of it
that is going to help make it look
shorter and more upturned so those are
just some examples of like you changing
the shape of the face and a great way to
look at how you really can transform the
face with contouring with highlights and
shadows is looking at drag makeup
obviously this is a very exaggerated
form of highlighting and contouring and
when you are highlighting and contouring
as a makeup artist and like for high
fashion all these things you definitely
want something more subtle unless you're
doing something more avant-garde or
something that is more editorial it's
more natural but if we go to the other
spectrum here and we look at drag makeup
you can really see the difference it can
make these men are changing their face
shapes to look more feminine this is
highlighting and contouring and it's
most exaggerated and full-out form but I
think if you can look at that you can
see the differences you can make and
kind of subtle you know take back a
little bit so like I said I understand
that not everyone wants look like a drag
queen and not everyone wants to have
that intensive makeup but I really do
think it's a good study if you want to
see how different lines and shapes
affect the face if you look at like a
before picture and an after picture you
can really see it in so much clarity
because it is so strong and you can
use that theory to help with your own
face so I'm gonna throw up a picture
really fast of corrective contouring for
each face shape because everyone's face
shape is different and I think every
face shape is beautiful and you don't
have to corrective contour in any way if
you don't want to if you love the
features that you have but if there's
something that you don't want or you
want to mimic the kind of standard of
beauty I know that's I hate saying that
but the oval face shape is considered
the most beautiful face shape because
it's like elongated but still very
symmetrical so all of the different face
shapes that you're saying and the
contours that are on them are going to
help you create an oval face shape with
your own face shape so for me I would
consider myself more round but I also
feel like I'm kind of heart shape and
the reason I say that is because I do I
mean I'm plus I so I do definitely have
some junk under my chin but I do have a
very pointy chin if you look at
different pictures of me depending on
the angle and all of that I feel like my
chin definitely comes to a point and I
feel like my widest point is kind of
like my cheekbone so for me contouring
my forehead because it is a little bit
wider and it's definitely wider than my
chin area as well as contouring not only
the hollows of my cheeks but also a bit
here on my cheekbones because it is the
widest part and you kind of want to
bring it in a little bit so it looks
more oval that is where I would want to
contour to help me get a more oval face
shape it also says that I would
highlight the center of the forehead as
well as my chin but I don't like to
highlight my chin too too much because I
feel like it already can get a little
pointy with that heart shape so just
that's just something that I don't like
to do personally and also because I am
more round I like to just have that
bronzer almost on the whole perimeter of
the face just slit in that area and
bring attention to the center of my face
and not the outer edges so anyway I hope
that face chart kind of helps you if you
are struggling I know everyone does kind
of the same thing with their
highlighting and contouring but if you
really want to slim your own features or
get the most desirable face shape on you
with your current face shape and you
want to do some corrective contouring I
suggest checking that out now I'm
obviously talking just about face shape
but not about like nose and you know
more intricate details you can contour
the lips you can do highlighting and
with like basically any part of the face
but I suggest just playing around and
really with contour it's all about being
subtle there's an art to being subtle
you don't want to see stripes you want
it to look like your natural face shape
and the way the shadows and lights are
hitting you that's because that's your
bone structure that's what you
ultimately want so I definitely suggest
you know being light handed using
smaller brushes and we'll get into that
in a second what brushes I suggest but
it's okay to be subtle and it shouldn't
look like you have contour on it really
is that subtle obviously makeup has no
rules though so if you choose to really
have that line and really cut it deep
then that's what you're choosing to do
but I really think there's an art to
being subtle that kind of gets lost on
YouTube and I think that's one of the
biggest differences between like YouTube
Instagram makeup which you know we talk
about a lot and doing actual client
makeup or doing more like fashion makeup
or doing film and TV like you don't want
anything that is too harsh so okay I
think I covered everything I wanted to
with contouring so I hope that helped
I'm not sure if this is any new
information maybe it is maybe it's not
but yeah I just highly suggest playing
around with your face shape really
studying your features and you know it's
okay to be comfortable in your own skin
I am NOT saying by any means that you
should do this you should contour this
makeup is fun and these are just some of
the rules to consider if you wanted to
try them out and then from there I feel
like you can make your own decisions
like no I don't like doing it that way I
actually like doing it this way or this
is the look I prefer or what not so
let's get into bronzing then then what
is bronzing if that's contouring and
kind of like I mentioned with the medium
skin tones and the Tanner skin tones
they can use bronzer and contour in a
very similar way especially if they're
matte shades and the bronzer is three
shades or so darker than their skin tone
but bronzer is something that brings
life back to the face it's supposed to
give you like a sunkissed glow in theory
you're applying it to places the Sun
would naturally hit you on the face or
on the body and generally this tends to
be a bit warmer toned so it's going to
have that warmth and
yeah like it just to me injects life
back into the makeup especially after
you've put your base on a foundation
which is kind of like canceled out any
natural shape and definition you might
have had bronzer can bring some of that
back while adding that like warmth and
sunkissed look to the skin
I love bronzer if you can't do for
myself personally I tend to use bronzer
as a contour for me I don't like doing
anything to chiseled I did a little bit
more today just to kind of like you know
for my contour video so when it comes to
bronzers these can be matte or
shimmering I prefer a matte bronzer for
the most part because I'm really looking
at the color aspect but that is the
reason that you see shimmery bronzers
and it's not bad to have a shimmery
bronzer when you look at what a bronze
are supposed to do since it is just
warming up the face it doesn't
necessarily have to have the dimension
that a matte bronzer would give in the
sense of like receding because it's
going to the high points of the face
anyway and that's another difference
between the contour is that bronzer you
would put like here on the forehead and
you can put some on the nose and you
could put some even on like the tops of
the cheekbones and the chin and almost
kind of dusting it a little bit all over
just to like give your skin that natural
radiance yeah that's kind of it I mean
it's not that deep I love bronzer the
most and it's the best I love it I love
it so so much it adds so much just
dimension and life to anyone's skin
nothing too warm like I don't like an
orange bronzer but depending on people's
skin tone again one bronzer might look
orange in the pan and if you're using it
on someone who's very fair-skinned it's
going to look orange on them but if you
use it on someone who has a more tan
skin tone it's not going to look as
orange and I think Mac give me Sun is a
really good example of that
for some people it works beautifully and
is so amazing and for other people it is
so orange and they're like how does
anyone make this thing work and that's
again because color is relative y'all
hello
color is relative alright so I am going
to get into some of the products that I
own in my collection what I use what I
suggest and then things that I have in
my kit and go into brushes so I hope
that was enough like theory for you guys
too of anything just experiment more
with your makeup and
I know what you're doing and make more
informed decision of why you're placing
things and makeup and what putting that
color in that area is going to do to
your face shape so okay yeah yeah let's
get into products though I'll let you
know if I use them on myself or if I use
them on clients and kind of distinguish
that well we're gonna start off with
cream and liquid products I realized I
didn't like distinguish between liquid
and cream when I was talking about
contouring because ultimately
technique-wise and like theory wise it's
the same thing you're just using
different products to achieve it
all right so I have three different
products in my own personal collection
for contouring and bronzing again for me
personally I just kind of do it all in
one to add that dimension to my face
because I'm not personally really
worried about being like chiseled all of
the time like I want some definition to
my face but I don't need to you know
really sculpt it like that it's not my
preference so for contouring I only have
like one contouring product in my own
collection that is cream this is the
jordana sculpting glow creamy contour
stick super affordable and a really nice
product this is very cool toned as you
can see which is great because it's
going to help give that shadow for my
lighter complexion this does come in
three different shades so if you're a
little bit darker you can check those
out and see if they would work for you
I'm not sure I don't have experience
with those ones it's just the one I have
what I like about this is that it's easy
to shear out and that's something with
cream products that's really great I
love how you can easily blend things out
I feel like sometimes they're easier
than powder although I feel like I hear
the opposite a lot of the time here on
YouTube people saying that cream
contouring and bronzing is very
difficult so just a few tips you want to
make sure you apply the products almost
slightly higher than you actually want
the product to go because you're going
to be blending this product out and so
you don't want to blend something too
low especially when it comes to the
hollows of the cheek so hopefully that
tip might help you out a little bit but
just practice makes perfect
another tip as well is to apply your
contour or bronzer first and then go in
with your highlight or concealer because
a lot of us use concealer as a
highlighter we have concealers that are
about two to three shades lighter than
our skin tone we're using that to
highlight under the eye highlight the
forehead
highlights on the bridge of the nose
maybe the chin and you can use that
concealer to clean up any areas where
you went a little bit too far with your
bronzer or your cream contour so I
suggest always doing the contour or
bronzing first and then going in with
your highlight for bronzing I have two
different products and I really do love
both of these I would say I prefer the
milk one but the Clarins one is still
really great but it is limited edition
it's only out right now currently anyway
this is the milk bronzing stick in the
shade baked they do have one shade
darker as well and I love this I used it
today and this blends out so easily
again it gives me that warmth but
because it's darker than my skin tone
it's also going to give me a bit of
definition as well so highly highly
suggest that I've talked about it a lot
similarly the Clarins one is just a more
liquidy form this is a very sheer
product as well I get sheers out very
nicely and that's it next to the milk
one they're very similar in tone this
one's slightly warmer but again because
it shears out I don't find that there's
any issues I really enjoyed this product
when it comes to my kit and when I work
on other people I tend to just use
concealers or foundation colours that
are about three shades darker than the
person I'm working on skin tone so yeah
that's what I use they don't necessarily
use like a contouring product
specifically I just use shades of
foundation to do some under work for the
powders I'm going to put on top so so I
don't really have anything necessarily
specific to share with you guys there
when it comes to powder contour I really
only have one product currently well I
have two and they're kind of new to my
collection because again on myself
personally I don't use a ton of contour
so one of the contour items that I have
and kind of like the only individual one
is from Kevin of Quan I actually got
this sent to me which is amazing and
this is like a cult classic product in
the community I have the shade light and
I think this is really great for fair
skin tones this is a really nice taupe
that isn't going to pull too orange it's
not going to pull too red it's going to
give you the depth and the kind of like
shadow cast that you need to create some
dimension to the face without it looking
super obvious so I highly suggest this
sheers out really nicely it's buildable
it blends really nice so I highly
suggest this I've also been bringing it
into my kit and everything when I've
been working on gigs so this has been a
great product and then again in my
personal collection this is something
very very new to me I just got it in the
new fabfitfun box and this is the Tarte
TARDIS Pro sculpt no pro glow palette
I'm sorry and this has two different
contouring products one is a cream one
is a powder and this is another one of
those really nice taupe sheets so it's a
very promising shade this one here is
the tarte one and then that one's the
kind of quan just so you guys know but
again that's only gonna work for like
lighter skin tones because it's going to
look too ashy on someone where the
saturation again isn't matched when it
comes to my kit i have a classic in
there this is the Anastasia contour kit
I feel like this works on most skin
tones especially because I tend to work
on a lot of like medium to tan skin
tones and this one works this is the
light/medium kit and when I'm working on
someone that's a bit more fair I use the
center shade when I'm working on someone
who has a bit more of a tan I'll go with
this one
and then when I'm contouring with deeper
skin tones I have a palette from Kryolan
I believe I will insert a picture of it
here but I use these different powders
to create contour there are some really
dark ones which are really nice they're
not too red they're not too orange and
then like I mentioned before I also have
the Mac blush in film noir as a
potential contour as well again though
personally I don't find that I'm really
like contouring like crazy in reality
I'm doing just kind of enhancing of the
face so just like regular contouring and
then in some cases I am doing some
corrective contouring but it's very
light I'm not like completely changing
someone's facial structure oh I forgot
to mention too I just got this pur
palette and this also has some nice
darker tones so that's another one I
have let's move on to bronzers I have a
lot here so I'm just gonna talk about my
favorite ones because honestly there are
so many bronzers on the market and
everyone's preference is different along
with skin tones so you really need to
experiment and find the shades that work
best for you you guys know I love my
butter bronzer this one is the light
bronzer and I do keep this in my kit
this is a kind of satin finish so it's
not
shimmery at all but it's also not
technically matte and I love the way
this looks on the skin it adds a glow
and again not because of the shimmer
necessarily just because of the light
just mmm tint this gives the skin it
looks so pretty um they do have four
shades of this now so they are expanding
the shade range but if you have very
deep skin I don't know how well these
will work for you but for anyone who has
a lighter skin tone or even up to like a
medium tan these are really nice another
bronzer that's worked really well for me
as someone with fair skin is the Laura
Geller baked impressions bronzer this is
nice because it's not too dark it's
matte and it is buildable it's a good
formula it definitely has more warmth to
it than obviously a contour but it's not
going to look like orangie and it's not
too saturated for fair skin a product I
use quite consistently in my kit is the
Laguna bronzer from NARS I really enjoy
this one I think it works nice as not
only a bronzer but again on like medium
skin tones you can also use it to kind
of contour and sculpt the face of it
another bronzer I use in my kit all the
time and something that is one of my
favorite products this is the G fall
sheen this is the deuce Chris or I don't
know this is an older product in my
collection but I just love it it's very
similar in results to the butter bronzer
but it's a bit warmer and this just adds
such nice warmth to people who have like
a medium skin tone who already have some
of those warm undertones coming through
I love this I love this so much and this
is a nice formula because it's sheer and
buildable so I can build up where I want
it and really just bring that like Sun
and warmth to the skin this one is like
intense this one's from Dior and this is
one of those bronzers that people like I
am orange when I use this and that might
be your preference so if you want a
really warm orange bronzer this is the
shade honey tan but if you also are a
more warm skin tone and deeper this
might work really nicely for you if
you're looking for something nice and
warm and really sunkissed this is
definitely a warmer bronzer I used this
on Katie from second wives club all the
time because she really likes a warm
bronzer I think the last bronzer I
really want to mention is the one from
Estee Lauder and this is bronze goddess
I feel like the
is a bit more red toned so this one's
really nice again it's kind of one of
those ones that isn't quite matte but it
isn't really too shimmery and those are
like my favorite finishes when it comes
to bronzer since I'm not needing it to
be super contouring and really received
my cheeks or anything I really like the
skin finishes because it really gives
you the best of both worlds of giving
you the sunkissed glow where like the
Sun hits you but also giving you some
dimension and last four products I
wanted to mention a little bit on the
highlighting side when it comes to
deeper skin tones I know a lot of us
have heard about like yellow under-eye
powders or like the banana powder which
I have here from Ben Nye but this is
super important to have in your kit if
you are going to be doing deeper skin
tones since I don't have a deeper skin
tone it's something that I had to learn
and like you know adjust my eye to
because if you just put a white powder
or something that has like a lighter
white base on someone with a darker skin
tone it's going to be ashy it's gonna
look bad so bad so you need to match the
saturation and warmth at their skin and
that's why the banana powder works and
this banana powder though will not work
for someone like me this will look
yellow on my skin tone and it can seem
like oh my gosh it's just gonna look
yellow but it doesn't it looks great but
it also keeps the natural undertone of
your Hiatt skin well um while still
highlighting I also have topaz here
depending on how dark and depending on
again undertone and whatnot you can like
kind of custom mix your own powder
sometimes I'll even mix banana powder
with a normal like translucent setting
powder so that it's not so opaque that's
something that I feel like as an artist
you should be doing is not just taking
products that come but like mixing and
matching and custom creating colors for
each situation in each person so I just
wanted to mention that because the
banana powder I feel like it's thrown
around and really it's not for everyone
it's important and needs to be used on
some people and then for other people
it's too dark and doesn't work so yeah
this can definitely help especially if
you're doing like reverse contouring
where you are going to be using
highlighting
essentially to give yourself dimension
to your face yeah some of these powders
my house or at least color wise powders
that are similar in color and last let's
talk about some brushes I know this
video is so so long
I hope you enjoyed it I'm going to talk
about bronzing brushes first because
they're my favorite and I also use these
again to contour my own face and a lot
of times if I'm using the bronzer
contour method on someone I'm just using
the one brush so these are all like very
similar they're like an oval shaped
brush I have a video all on brushes so
I'm gonna leave that link down below
these are so nice because they not only
have some precision application but they
also blend out product so highly suggest
these this is a Kat Von D brush this one
I just got in my boxycharm it's the
Aesthetica brush and then this one is
from Coastal Scents in a kit highly
suggest that type of shape of brush
which is like a tulip I think that's
what that's called right another way to
apply bronzer is just like a big old
powder brush I feel like this was
definitely the way to apply bronzer at
the beginning of my YouTube career I
would watch like Shannon so use our
pickle powder brush to bronze up her
face this is going to be great if you're
gonna do like the classic bronzer method
where you're really hitting the high
points of the face felt like if you're
brushing this on the face wherever this
is naturally hitting it's obviously not
gonna like go into the socket of the eye
and go into the socket of the cheek that
is where that products going to touch
and that would be where the Sun would
actually hit them so this is a great way
if you're doing like an all-over kind of
face bronzing and then let's get into
contouring I have a couple different
brushes to show you I think that if
you're starting off and you're really
wanting a more chiseled look smaller
brushes are gonna be the way to go this
one is the Real Techniques contour brush
it's very small so you can get right
into where you want to chisel out your
cheeks where you want to go under the
chin if you want to go into the hairline
like for me I don't necessarily do the
temples I do more my hairline because it
is receding so I'm like you know trying
to make that not look as noticeable I do
that especially with men as well you
know if they have like more of a
receding hairline I will put a bit of a
contour slash bronzer in those areas to
draw attention away from them and have
those recede and have like you know the
rest of their face kind of come forward
so anyway I like this brush this is a
brush from anastacio and this is the a
18 it is nice and like kind of like a
chisel II type of brush so if I want to
do a contour and kind of like stamp it
and then I'll blend up so stamp and
blend up again just very
lightly barely adding any product and I
slowly build that up this is a great
brush for that similarly this one is
from Smashbox it's their contour brush
it came with the contour kit and this
one is so nice and tiny I especially
like it for myself personally on my nose
if I do want to do something a little
bit more precise because I tend to just
kind of like do too on my nose like it's
not a big deal I don't really try to
like contour contour it but that's what
I like this one for it really does get
fit nicely into the cheek area so that's
great I have a blush brush from ELF and
I think this would be a nice one as well
again just something very tiny and that
you can still blend with and last I have
some fan brushes fan brushes are really
great to apply bronzer and just get a
nice like airbrush application this one
is just when I got off of ebay it's like
a fatter one but it still is kind of
dense like you can definitely still do
some stuff with this of course you can
highlight but you can also kind of
sculpt out the cheek as well so if you
haven't tried this and you are looking
for a new way to apply bronzer or even
contour again because you do have some
precision application in the shape of a
line try this out and then this one is
from colour-pop and I really like this
brush it's a bit bigger so for applying
highlighter it's a little bit messy I
still like it but I think that bronzer
is a really nice way to use it and again
you can kind of cut the cheekbones a
little bit but still have some fluffy
blending bristles to blend it out so
those are some of my suggestions to try
contouring again though you can try what
you have in your collection and I hope
more than anything this video gave you
some information so you can kind of know
the classic rules when it comes to
contouring what the idea is behind it
what it's trying to do and you can
experiment and practice on your own face
shape to find out what you want your
makeup to do for you I know this was a
long video I've been wanting to do this
for a while but I kind of put it off
because I put a lot of pressure on
myself to hopefully actually teach you
guys some things and I wanted it to be
informative and I didn't want to miss
out on anything so I hope I said
everything I hope it was helpful and I'm
gonna end it here because it's already
way too long so thank you guys so much
for watching let me know what you guys
want to know more about in the
and again I hope it helped and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
