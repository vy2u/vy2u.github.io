this eye look here this is gonna be a
top through tutorial and I haven't done
one like that before but I kind of just
wanted to see how that would work I
don't know let me know your favorite
format I'm gonna try to be experimenting
just because it's all new territory I'm
trying to figure out what I like and I
hope you guys like this look though I
did like a copper eye on top and then a
pop of turquoise on the bottom I love
this look I've done this a lot and I
also featured a couple color pop shadows
which I absolutely love them and I'm
thinking about purchasing some but
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the look
let me know if your recreated or if you
do something similar and I will see you
in a second okay guys so I've already
done like my base foundation I haven't
set it with powder or anything because
in case you have fall out I'm gonna like
put concealer on and do all of that so
just letting you know I also have my
eyebrows on because they just help me do
my eyeshadow placement better so that's
why I like to have them done but anyway
let's get on to the eyeshadow look I
already have my lids primed and we are
gonna go in first off with just a big
fluffy brush like this I'm just gonna
take a cream shadow I'm using the one
from the lorac pro palette and I'm just
gonna put that all over my lid just
because the primary put on was kind of
sticky so I don't want that to interfere
with my blending so we're just doing
that to give us a nice base to blend a
shadow on top of
I don't know if I should have this be a
talk through I kind of think I'm going
to but it's gonna take forever so
apologies guys now that that is done I'm
going to do the tape trick today because
I want a really you know harsh harsh
line even though it's all we're always
blending so we don't have but anyway you
can just take your tape I'm sure you've
seen tons of tutorials using tape to
have that perfect outer corner so I'm
just putting it on the back of my hand
and I'm going to line these up hopefully
even right and get this going so that
when we blend our shadow when we remove
this it'll be like a cat that's what we
want
so that's one of the beautiful tapes on
my eye and I do like it kind of out more
than just 100% up you can also use your
brows to kind of help you place them so
that way you hopefully have the same
angle but yeah I'm kind of going toward
the end of my brow here now you're just
praying out those are even okay so I'm
gonna take my Sigma e-40
yeah you forty brush and I'm gonna blend
a really just base color so I'm gonna
use taupe from the pro palette just to
blend into my crease and get me kind of
a transition color going because we are
gonna use some color pop eyeshadows
today so just blending that now that you
have the tape it's gonna create this
like line for you which is awesome it's
so much easier than having to clean it
up yourself or be precise who likes to
do that and you can be kind of sloppy
with this you don't want to take it too
high but it is in the upper crease is
where we're kind of blending this and
kind of focusing it on that outer corner
as well and we'll just do that to the
other eye let me know if you guys like
talk throughs I don't know I I feel like
I'm trying really hard to get the whole
tutorial thing down because they think
they're so fun and I love doing a shadow
looks so you know I want to be able to
share with you guys not only products I
like but me actually using them is you
don't just think I'm a crazy person but
I also don't want bad lighting and
editing with music like it's repetitive
let's get rid of but just let me know
what your favorite style is so far or
like any tips if you do the more
whatever that you think might work just
because I really I've been enjoying the
last couple I've done but you know I
want them to be something you guys will
like as well so okay so just a nice
simple transition this is a little
darker than I usually would go but it's
no big deal
next we're going to be using this color
pop eyeshadow in the color sequin and
I'm going to be patting that on the lid
I like to use my fingers with these
shadows because they are like a cream
and I am gonna put powder on top of this
just because I have another eyeshadow
that I like to but um it's gonna look
really awesome so just Pat that on the
lid I'm not using like a glitter base or
anything like that I I don't seem to
have a problem with the fallout of these
so I'm not worrying about it these are
so crazy pigmented I absolutely love
them so much I am like so close to
ordering more eye shadow from them just
because they are so beautiful they have
some like limited edition ones I want to
try the lippie stix
and pencils oh they're great and they're
so cheap five dollars please honey
they're so good okay and you just want
to be keeping this color on that lid you
don't want to go past the crease
definitely because once we blend out you
just it'll get too crazy you know like
be glitter at your brow bone before you
know it so just keep it really contained
and beautiful I love this color
specifically it's like a coppery red
Brown type of color it's really pretty
and we're just gonna do that to the
other eye
okay so that's what the eyes look like
once we've applied that cream shadow all
over them we'll creamish eyeshadow I
guess next we're gonna go in with a
Coastal Scents hot pot this is one of my
favorite colors and I know it's so
pretty like this color is so beautiful
but I want it to be a little bit more
orange so I'm gonna be using this color
here by Coastal Scents this is hpm eo3
sorry I don't have like the technical
name but that's it's on the back and I'm
gonna take my Sigma East 70 brush it's
like an angled one and I'm going to put
this just on top of that color I just
don't want so much sparkles things we're
gonna do like a pop of color on the
lashline I don't want it to be just too
crazy if that makes sense I mean it's
gonna look pretty intense and not
everyone would wear this like this is a
wearable look to me but not everyone it
goes great like I do just put that on to
the eye lid on top of that color again
not going past the crease because we're
saving the crease for blending and I
would tap this shadow if you have them
just because you want to avoid as much
fun as you can
fallout is the bane of my existence I
hate it it's horrible
and then we're just doing the other way
this is super simple anyone could do
this step okay all right still look
super sparkly it just I don't know I
just wanted to do that stuff like had to
do that step so next we're gonna start
blending some colors out which is fun I
am going to first take this like not
super fluffy blending brush but a
blending brush and I'm gonna go into
sable from the lorac pro palette and I'm
going to keep this mostly on the outer
corner but also bringing it in a little
bit just to blend out those colors I
want a gradient effect so I want this to
be like the lightest color and then it
fade into pretty dark Browns I think
that'll look really good so let's do it
let's get this going girls or guys
whatever um you know see I'm keeping it
on that outer corner and you can kind of
cover up the color a little bit on the
inside or I mean outside I'm sorry on
that outer corner you can kind of use it
and we're just trying to blend blend
blend see how different that looks so
different
so much better
okay so I think that's a good level of
blending ness
it turned off again but I think it's
because a battery still got that figured
out anyway in case we didn't know I am
just blending out the colors I just
applied so that they look good you know
the drill I'm telling you to have the
best eye look you just want to blend
blend blend and then blend some more the
blending zone seems appropriate for a
makeup artist something to do while you
spend all your time blending
we are now gonna put cream from the
lorac Pro palette under the brow bone
I'm gonna keep this matte I love a matte
brow bone highlight I think frosty is
ones can get a little outdated but you
know you do you that's what you like but
it's just there's a lot going on so
matte colors are just gonna be best for
things that aren't like the standout of
the show if you have too many shimmers
going on it can get a little crazy real
fast real fast I'm gonna call it done
for the top lid so I think I'm gonna
remove the tape we're gonna remove the
tape and see what comes out hopefully
it's a pretty picture well look at that
look at that boom baby and we have cat
eyes without doing crap
I love it we are gonna move on to the
bottom lash line now so first thing I'm
gonna put this NYX jumbo pencil in milk
I'm like I look so creepy when I do this
like stare you guys I'm gonna put this
NYX jumbo pencil in milk on my waterline
because we are going to be putting some
crazy color up in here so just try not
to poke your eye out or kill yourself
while you do this step it can come down
a little bit too because we are gonna be
applying a bright turquoise shadow
that's what I like to do it's so hard to
do this on camera so hard guys I think
you're not supposed to like do your eyes
like that okay check it out it looks a
little messy but we're just gonna go
with it it'll look good I promise we're
gonna use another color pop eyeshadow
this one is in the color chipper and
it's like a turquoise color we're going
to be using
that and putting it on the lower
lashline not on the waterline because
that kind of freaks me out but
definitely on the lower lashline I'm
just using a smaller flat detail brush
okay let's do it
and I'm probably gonna go over this a
couple times because I want it as
pigmented as possible and then we are
going over this with a shadow too you
don't have to do this you can use like
these aren't just for like theses like I
know I keep using them that way but you
can use them as like the main thing if
you want you do everyone and we're gonna
like don't worry about like this section
where they're not really matching each
other because we are gonna blend out and
add some other colors so if you were
worried honey it's okay I got you
covered and we're just gonna do that to
the other side this videos gonna be
crazy here isn't really who aren't you
and please never talk to us again okay
and I'm taking the green down kind of
far like it's not right on the lash line
that is down a little bit I just want
that color to really pop through so
that's what I'm doing again if it's too
much you can totally make this look work
for you I'm all about that I'm taking
this Real Techniques detail a little
brush it's so cute and I'm going to be
taking another shadow by Coastal Scents
I'm gonna take this hot pot it's
shimmery and beautiful in the color s11
shimmer 11 I think that's what that
stands for and we're going to take that
on top of that color and just make sure
it's even brighter and you really don't
need to take too much on that outer bit
just because I'm gonna add some Browns
just to kind of tie it in a little bit
more but then I go and just do it even
though I just told you you don't have to
do it with
be careful not to get shadow in your
eyes that happens in it's horrible we're
done with that I'm gonna take I'm gonna
take the same little small brush I'm
gonna go in with another shadow this is
the color see spray a real name yeah and
that's gonna go on that white shadow or
cream shadow we put in our water line I
know it's a little scary if you guys I'm
gonna do this step I'm kind of almost
with you because it's you're defying
like a ton of freaky it's freaky but I'm
doing it do it I'm going in but yeah I'm
just powdering that water line color is
good again this is scary
please don't do this job if it scares
you but yeah that's the difference it's
like this is the one I've done there's
shadow and this is the one I haven't you
can see I just don't want it so stark
white but I want it a little bit of
color I don't know this is just what I
do I've done this like a couple times
before and it's just what I do okay both
eyes are done so we're over the torture
session ahead is over yeah okay I'm
gonna take staple from the lorac Pro
palette and I'm gonna be putting that on
the outer like 1/3 I'd say maybe a
little bit farther in and we're just
using this to kind of tie it in I mean
you could leave it like this and I think
it still look great but since it is a
colorful look I kind of want it to just
tie in better I'm looking at myself
looking at myself yeah so I'm just going
to tighten using that sable color just
because I don't know that's just what I
want to do
now I'm gonna go in with that X or so
color and just darken up that a little
bit this is intense very intense wind
going on guys okay I like that I'm gonna
just blend a little bit more I'm using a
duo fiber brush like this just since
it's not very dense just gonna be kind
of wispy wispy blending on the bottom
lashline and don't worry about like
weird stuff we still have to go in with
a concealer and that is gonna definitely
help us make it look good I took rice
paper from Mac and I put this on the
inner corners because it's a little more
yellow toned
don't worry yellow toned so I thought it
would look good with the look and now
I'm gonna go clean out the fallout from
under my cheeks because there's quite a
bit of fallout and I'm also going to
apply some concealer and my normal
powder and I'm gonna do all that stuff
and then I'm gonna come back and do some
eyeliner mascara and we'll finish out
this look I'll be back I am back and I
have my face done and I don't do my
eyeliner and mascara on camera so I'm
gonna do that really fast and then I
will show you guys the final look I
guess I'm in a tight line with this
which tight lining is just for you put
this on like instead of the under
waterline the top part of that flap of
skin so again a kind another torture
torture session but this is gonna help
make your lashes look bigger and more
full at the base it also gives me
definition since I don't want to use the
real estate of my lids for liner it's a
way to still get that definition from
liner without having it on my eyelid
that's why I do it but anyway I'm gonna
go in go in with this one so here's a
close-up of the look guys
and I'm gonna zoom out so you guys can
see like the full shebang here okay guys
so that is the final look I hope you
enjoyed this and let me know what
toriel's again you want to see in the
future or like palettes do you want to
see I kind of been I've kind of been
enjoying filming these it's kind of fun
