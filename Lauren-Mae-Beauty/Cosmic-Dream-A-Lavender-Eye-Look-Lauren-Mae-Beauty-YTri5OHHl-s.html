eyebrows today and we are just getting
it straight into the tutorial and I'm
going to be doing like a lavender eye
the first thing I am going to be doing
is taking this Laura Mercier caviar
stick in the shade orchid and I'm going
to be putting on all over my lids and
blending it out now that we have prime
Nerlens I'm going to take this eyeshadow
by Sephora this is in the shade
iridescent shell it's why they're
limited edition duochrome ones right now
it's a very pretty
silvery pinky purple duochrome I'm gonna
use that shadow and I'm also going to
use this brush by Sigma this is the e55
eyes shading brush spray that with a
little bit of mac fix+ and I'm going to
use that what all over my lid just to
give it a more intense shine and shine
that is what that looks like and at this
point you don't need to worry about any
fault that's fallen on your cheeks
that's why we're doing our eye makeup
first so we're gonna clean that up
at the very end now that I've had that
main color on there I'm gonna take this
shade from The Naked basics palette it
is the color naked too
and I'm gonna put that in my crease and
I'm gonna put that in my crease gently
blending out that purple shade so that
way we don't have any harsh lines you
can use any type of matte blending color
that you have just make sure it's matte
okay so that is just the our crease kind
of blended out we are now gonna go in
with like a darker purple shade I'm just
gonna take a mix between Caitlin rose by
makeup geek and mo8 from Coastal Scents
and I'm just focusing this on the outer
corner and in the outermost crease area
and I'm just gonna blend that out with
that same brush without adding any extra
product just to make sure that there's
no harsh lines
now I'm going to take just that mm 0-8
hot pot from Coastal Scents I'm going to
get the littlest amount of that color
I'm going to blend that out in the very
upper crease kind of right after that
transition shade just to kind of bring
worn a little pop of color to the
now that I feel like I like the way that
looks I'm gonna go back with that
original Sephora shape that's on the lid
and just brighten it up we've lost a
little bit with the blending so we're
just gonna brighten up with the same
brush we did before it's same thing now
I'm going to go into Thrax vanilla just
highlight my brow bone
I'm also gonna go in with cracker from
stories makeup Haven because it's a
little more pigmented at least for that
very upper part of the problem okay and
then I always blend out my things when
we go back in with the same brush and
I'm going to wipe a little bit of
product off of it but I'm just going to
be using this to blend again those two
colors together I might go in a little
bit with the naked color and just gently
blend so again we have a seamless
transition up to the brow bone
I'm gonna go in clean up underneath and
I do my foundation and I blush and all
of that and then we will go in with the
lower lash line okay so that is with my
face done now we're gonna work on the
lower lash line first thing I'm going to
do is take this pencil by Stila you can
use any type of Rosie brownie purpley
color and I'm just gonna put that on the
lower lash line and smudge it out with
my finger now that that's done I'm going
to take this really small Real
Techniques accent brush and I'm going to
take that Caitlin rose color we used on
the outer corner and I'm going to be
putting that on the lash line smudging
it as close to the lash line as possible
and then I'm only doing two take that in
like a third of the way and then we'll
be blending it out later
we're going to take another Real
Techniques brush this is their brow
brush it's kind of a fatter angled tip
I'm gonna take Coastal Scents hotpot and
M zero eight and I'm going to just take
a little bit of that we're gonna blend
that color out again keeping us on the
other the outer third of the lash line I
guess it's more like a door to third I'm
gonna take this fluffy blending brush
that we've been using and I'm gonna take
a little bit of Naked 2 and just kind of
overall blend that all out so even blow
it out use further doesn't wash now
we're going to do the inner corner for
that I'm gonna be taking a shade from
the interstellar palette I'm gonna be
taking this purple shade right here that
is called Orion and I'm gonna be taking
that on a little pencil brush and I'm
gonna put that on the inner corner and
also bring it to connect up with that
lower lash line
but decided I wanted to do a little bit
more on my brow bone so I'm gonna be
taking this pink shade from the
interstellar palette this is in the
color like in I'm not sure and it's kind
of an iridescent white that shines pink
in the light so I'm just going to take a
little bit of that remember that's the
highest point of the ground
now we need to tightline I'm gonna be
using this buxom little mini stamp I'm
just trying to use it up it's just in
like a dirt gray almost black color you
can use whatever you want all we have
left to do is our flash and it's so you
can take whatever you guys have I'm
gonna just be using this covergirl lash
full lash bloom I don't really like it
but I'm trying to use it and you're just
going to apply generous coats of mascara
it's a really lashy look I don't like to
use false lashes at this point in my
life so I'm just gonna use this and
build it up until I like the effect
last thing that I waste up my brows I'm
going to use da Nastasia clear brow gel
to do that
that guy's is the final like I hope you
like it I'm gonna zoom in and get a
close-up of my eyes hopefully I look
good
I hope you've enjoyed this look let me
know in the comments down below what
colors or what looks you'd like to see I
want to try to film warn these just so I
can get better at them it's also strange
so I hope you guys are having a great
day and I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
