every time and every time we try to film
together
he can not hi guys welcome back to my
channel it's Lauren thank you so much
for watching and today I have my special
guest today we're gonna be doing a
Costco haul because we love Cusco what
I've been trying to figure out why Sam
does not comprehend the idea of hauls
don't get it you'd like so what's the
point of this and like to show them like
what we bought so comment down below if
you know what the point is if you can
tell this favorite thing to do whenever
he gets on my channel is to direct you
guys to do to shut up number one
favorite thing do this do that it's
ridiculous like subscribe hit the bed
like your job email me at 1 2 3 Sammy
boy Jenkins calm anyway I thought I
would just be fun to show you guys what
we've bought at Costco
we love Costco we love to get the pizza
it's like a fun time for us if we are
like hey what should we do it's like go
to the movies with our movie pass or go
to Costco with ours or Costco packs
everyday it's a married couple things
anyway just show you guys what we bought
from Costco and we haven't been in a
while so these are the random things so
we picked up I hope you guys enjoy I
don't know if you guys shop at Costco
let us know in the comments and what is
your favorite they know what to do know
I actually care we go again guys comment
below if you're sick and time that's all
to commenting below well let's just get
into the hall and maybe Sam will
understand it about the hairs we're
gonna start with food first
umm if you guys don't know coughs goes
like a wholesale food place where you
can buy stuffs in really large
quantities for a really good price so I
would say both yeah ok so anyway the
first thing that we bought was this boom
chicka pop sweet and salty kettle corn
this is an abnormally large bag
if you can see compared to our head
sizes it's quite large this is really
good fat chick go rocket chicka-boom
anyway it's delicious and I like kettle
corn out of all the popcorns I choose a
kettle corn next item we got was chicken
chicken in a can chicken of the land not
chicken of the sea though it looks like
tuna this includes chicken breast meat
water seasoning salt modified food
starch sodium phosphate chicken by the
natural flavors delicious very good for
your heart I like to make chicken salad
with that so that's why we bought that
next we got taco seasoning mrs. I hope
this isn't a weird haul i realizing
right now my love I realized right now
that this haul is gonna be weird I
promise it's not all food we'll get into
other things and I totally understand
that this is not a video you would enjoy
I guess I'm hoping Samm will make it
more interesting pressures at home yeah
this is a really nice one its massive I
really enjoy making like taco chicken
lettuce or seasoned yeah seasoning very
good let's do the last bit of like food
stuff which the last bit here is like
kind of drink based oh we have a little
Kroy so we went on a Sunday and they
have if you've never been to Costco they
have like people that do samples and
stuff and so what did we get a sample of
all over there we got a sample of the
chicken nugget and it was really soggy
and I really like my stuff crispy so it
was fine but they also had a sample of
the nimble nectar and they were handing
out samples of this they have four
different flavors but we picked up only
three of them this one is the tangerine
lime really good tangy a little bit
bitter you definitely taste the lime and
we're gonna mix this with alcohol we
don't drink a time but the next thing
will seem so contrary to that but I
really want to add just like a little
bit of this to water and since I would
be really good ever eaten the pineapple
fellas
we'll have a juicy orange here is what I
got
this one's pineapple orange flavor I
really enjoyed it and they also
recommend like I was going to tell you
they recommend if you can make this with
sparkling water which I think I might
try if I ever get my hands on some
sparkling water and the third flavor
that we got is the cranberry ginger
missed a lot guys we cut a lot out so
far to get to this third flavor just so
you know and this is not one that I
enjoy I don't really like this the taste
of ginger very much yeah the gingers a
little spicy it's pretty good I yeah I
kind of like it it's like if you have a
Moscow Mule I just have the ginger beer
portion none of these are alcoholic but
oh yeah yes juice is essentially yeah he
said it's just like pressed juice with
like a bit of cane sugar yeah it's nice
so yeah we got all those and they were
on a good deal because they were
specifically there to like show us it so
that was great that leads us into our
next thing I can't even grab it we
chatted I want you to think of a rap
song right now something what t-pain
sings about grape juice me so this is
what I picked up this is 39.99 so I
thought it's pretty good for this
massive bottle of Grey Goose coupon rate
is no coupon needed at Costco also if
you don't have a Costco membership you
can still buy booze there if you're just
you know oh it's a weekend I don't know
if it's in other states but here in
California it's something to do with
laws and stuff so yeah that's just a
little a little Costco tip yeah this is
really I feel like I'm the only one
because it's it's really heavy also it
came with vermouth that's why we wanted
it to because they've never had that and
we thought it would go well with those
other juices I guess oh well we honestly
don't drink very often but when we but
when we do I guess we'll be drinking
Grey Goose
we're gonna get into this boring one
we'll get into the buckteeth in a second
we picked up some printer ink because
we're out for printing a lot of things a
lot of picton going on it's like a
regular printing press yeah printer ink
next
okay let's - can we do something fun Oh
Loren's this is something I'm actually
so excited about hand so okay so these
are the coconut oil bat these are the
new port in home hands hips I've
actually used one of these up before
everything's so massive I actually used
one of these up before I got it at
Marshall's and I really enjoyed it
so these come like three different suns
one is lemon verbena rosemary mint and
wild lavender I think we have the
lavender one last time it was really
nice yeah
should last us a while yeah I'm so
excited this was only $9.99 - I thought
that was pretty good price the one I
bought in Marshalls was $6.99 I believe
it was a while ago so I like using these
in the kitchen because they're nice and
fresh since but I might use them in the
bathroom - again no coupon can't wait
what's that no discount code follow my
link below for more hands up next we
picked up some Crest Whitestrips so
we're gonna have some sparkly white
teeth these are pretty this is so hard
to show we'll see if they work you got a
do own 14 days in a row oh we should do
the Crest Whitestrips challenge new
challenge challenge excessive no we have
we have a single paper towels it's kind
of boring yes so the last year probably
the things that we are enjoying the most
I think right now out of everything we
bought these because we love these
things

terrible naproxen and that fizzy
flavored water was spilled over the
apartment I'm pretty sure we were headed
there I've been enjoying blackberries so
