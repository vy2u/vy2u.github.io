learned this is going to be a first
impression on a new foundation actually
technically a BB cream today I'm going
to be testing out the covergirl clean
Matt BB cream and this is for oily skin
I have the shade 5 10 fair I love BB
creams those are some of my favorite
products but i do like decent coverage
too so i've heard good things about this
i'm excited to see how it does on my
oily skin still looking at cover girls
website here on my iPad it says cover
girls clean matt BB cream is an oil-free
formula that provides the perfect amount
of coverage to even skin tone hide
blemishes won't clog pores and keeps you
shine free all day long there are six
different shades of it which isn't a ton
but it is a BB cream and I feel like BB
creams and tinted moisturizers and
things of that nature usually have less
shades than like actual foundations so
it's better than like three shades i
have already primed my face today is the
hard candy sheer MV primer in the shine
free version so hopefully together these
two can really hold my oils i do have
oily skin i tend to get a lot of
breakdown of product around my chin and
my nose area i get oily in my t-zone so
i know not everyone primes when I do
these but for me I'm use a primer all
the time every day no matter what so
this is how I would use this product
normally so I'm going to put it to the
test with a primer I'm going to squeeze
a little bit of this on my hand that's
it there i got fair in a different
foundation and it was way too light but
this one doesn't seem nearly as light as
that one this is the hard candy one and
this is the clean matt it's like crazy
the difference let me show you on my
hand too that's the drugstore difference
between fair in one brand and fair in
another oh this is porcelain technically
but it's crazy so yeah i am gonna use a
beauty blender for one half of my face
this is my preferred method to apply any
type of product usually though with BB
creams i usually use my hands but i'm
gonna try a beauty blender and then i
brush on the other half so i'm gonna go
in with the beauty blunder first so far
color-wise it seems really good um i
feel like i'm going to need a lot of
product maybe I'll go in with dabbing it
on my face first so the way my Beauty
Blender doesn't soak up any
thing ok let's go in again for BB cream
i feel like the coverage is pretty nice
so that's one half of my face done with
the Beauty Blender so far I think it
looks really skin like it has decent
coverage it kind of reminds me of the
room will BB cream if you guys have ever
tried that it definitely has like that
type of coverage more than just like a
basic tinted moisturizer I did have some
like acne scarring here and it did cover
it up a little bit I definitely would
still go in with some concealer though
but overall definitely like even now my
skin tone and all that and that's like
with one layer so I think that's pretty
good i'm gonna go in with some more
foundation on the other side and i'm
gonna be using a brush this one is the
Real Techniques buffing brush i believe
and see how i get with this I feel like
brushes for me don't give me enough
coverage ever I just like that i can use
the Beauty Blender and just pounce the
product across I find that my skin just
doesn't take well to like foundations
being rubbed across it just doesn't take
it picks up product so I'm already
noticing that with the foundation right
now so I'm gonna just dab it like I did
so wasn't covering and then buff again
with this I don't know I feel like this
product is still kind of like
moisturizing it's kind of runny but
still thick I don't know that makes
sense I feel like it's kind of gunking
up my brush a little and I definitely
feel like I got better coverage with the
sponge and it just is like a better
finish like this side to me it just
looks more flawless and more like smooth
this side looks rough ER so I'm gonna go
in with my Beauty Blender and the rest
of this product and just try to build up
and do like a second layer especially on
like problem areas and then i'll zoom
you guys in for a closer look okay so
this is my face right now i think it
looks pretty dang good pretty natural i
still feel like overall texture wise i
like
cited started with a sponge better so I
personally you can just see the texture
here um so I personally would definitely
use the sponge I do feel like I had to
use a lot of product though you know you
can layer it and get a little bit of
extra coverage but it's not going to be
full coverage I did go in and later a
second layer like on this type of area
and I did put a little bit more here but
um you know there's still I still step
peeking through I'm definitely gonna go
in with concealer this is a BB cream so
I'm not expecting full coverage I feel
like you can build it with a second
layer but again it's not gonna be like
completely a hundred percent covering
everything so far I like this foundation
it feels nice on the skin doesn't feel
too heavy I do feel like I did have to
use quite a bit of product i kind of
think this might be a good one to use
with your hands that's how i use the
Rimmel BB cream and I find it just
applies the best that way so i will like
after this try it with my hands on you
guys know what I think but that is
everything i'm gonna apply some
concealer just on like specific areas
and then do the rest of my face and i
will be back right now it is 141 so I'm
gonna try to keep this on for eight
hours so that's like 10 or so at night
but let me go finish the rest of my
makeup and I'll come right back okay
guys i am back it's now 2 16 so it's
been about 30 minutes since the
foundations but on i did use concealer i
use the Maybelline fit me to go under my
eyes cover my blemishes that didn't get
covered all the way I feel like once I
did that at least for these ones cuz
these are just scars and no Chuck sure I
feel like it really covered nicely
definitely like the perfect amount of
coverage for me not not like entirely
blemish free but definitely like you
basically can't see it I feel like this
one didn't cover as well because it's
like actually raised and I think I had
something to do with covering it just a
little bit more difficult overall I do
really like this I like the feel on the
skin I will say that this foundation
does oxidized I had some of my hand and
it was like basically like a shade maybe
two darker than what it originally came
out as so if the hard candy glama flage
is like your color this might be a
little bit too dark for you or you're
going to need to use like a mixer with
it I feel like covergirl foundations do
that I had the
green one outlast stay fabulous or
whatever it is and it definitely
oxidized on me luckily I feel like it's
not like insane for me at least so I'm
fine with it but that's just something
to keep in mind i will say to that this
foundation did set so i did use powder
but you definitely don't have to if
that's not something you like to do or
if you want something a little bit more
natural or anything like that i like
using powder it helps keeping that
longer throughout the day because i
don't like to touch up so i did use some
of the Rimmel stay matte but I
definitely feel like if you didn't want
to you could get away with it and it had
a really nice texture where you could
touch her skin it wasn't like coming off
or transferring it was really nice so so
far I really like this i think it's it's
been good so we'll see how it lasts
about the day like i mentioned before i
do get oily mostly in my t-zone around
this portion of my face and then i do
get a lot of creasing in my nose that's
just like every foundation for me so
it'll be more like a miracle if
something doesn't happen like that yeah
hopefully it doesn't collect too bad in
the creases of my nose it just is like a
never-ending problem for me anyways I
will check back with you guys in a
little bit to let you know how it's
wearing and all that good stuff hi guys
ok so I meant the gym right now so I'm
really puttin this foundation to the
test this is what it looks like right
now it's like 545 so it's been on like
four hours looks amazing I don't feel
like really any sweat is coming through
any oils I feel really mad and any like
do that is it looks like natural skin I
really liked it so I thought I wouldn't
date you before I go work out I'm going
to try to be gentle and just have my
foundation if I get but I thought
it would just update you before the
whole gym thing
okay I'll see you guys hi guys I'm back
from the gym so I thought I would just
update you right after it's like 718 so
this is what it looks like I'm really
happy with how it's held up when I work
out it's not like a pretty cute little
workout I'm sweating I'm definitely
working out so for how it stayed on I
think it looks really good it is a
little shiny but it's still not anything
worse than anything else i use and i
usually don't work out and make up at
all i just did because of the checkups
for this foundation I did it for you
guys there is a little bit of product
removed from like where my glasses are
but I feel like honestly it's less
noticeable than normal like I feel like
normally it's like really kicked up
there and when I took them off at the
gym it wasn't nearly as caked up as
normal and then something else I wanted
to just know is that although it looks
shiny it still feels really mad it's all
sorry we're cooking pizza still feels
really mad it still feels um like when I
touch it just barely it doesn't feel
like a ton of product like with the
grease is coming off my face which is a
normal feeling for me so so far so good
I do like it i will check back though in
a couple of hours so i can give it the
full like eight hour where so i'll see
that okay guys this is going to be my
final update for the night this is what
my face looks like right now I'm gonna
zoom in I feel like the creasing around
my nose is pretty dang good especially
for what usually happened I feel like
usually I get a little cakey because the
foundations thick but I think because
this is like a BB cream it really didn't
settle there as much as normal I will
say him a little bit shiny at this point
but it doesn't feel like goopy like it
doesn't feel like if I went like this I
would just like cloth all this
foundation which is normal I think for
being on for at this point eight hours
it's like ten o'clock right now I
believe it's been on eight hours I also
didn't work out in this and it's been
super hot all day I feel really happy
with how it is I can't wait to try it
out tomorrow and just see how it works
on like a normal work do you for me so
far so good i say this is like a really
positive first impression definitely
stay tuned for like updates and stuff if
you see it in like a favorites or if you
want me to like do a recap after i do a
couple first impression foundations i
can do like a recap video of my last
like
or something let me know down below and
I can do that but that's everything for
tonight i will see you guys in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
