Lauren thank you so much for watching
today's gonna be a video on all of the
covergirl katie-cat glosses i was sent
the pr package with like all the glosses
all their different lip products all for
spring 2018 so I thought that I would do
a swatch video for you guys so I just
watched all of these lip glosses on my
lips so you guys can see what they look
like I'm also gonna have hand swatches
so basically I want this video to be
more informational in that sense than
necessarily a review but a few words on
these these come in twelve different
shades the packaging is pretty cute they
have like a little kitty top but I feel
like it's still functional which is nice
I feel like the most notable thing about
this range is that it has some pretty
crazy colors in it there's a blue
there's like a dark purple there aren't
a lot of nudes and that's something I
wish there were I am wearing one of them
today this is the tabby teased color and
I think it's really pretty I'm gonna
read you off the website really fast you
guys can know what they say about the
glosses because I think that kind of
gives you insight it says a katie-cat
gloss is a shining lipgloss created by
covergirl Katy Perry delivering thick
and luxurious lips that are perfect for
any occasion
Katie Kat gloss gives you the shiny lips
that you've been looking for with a soft
and creamy moisturized feel and I think
the key word there is like thick
these are definitely thicker glosses I
do think that they are more moisturizing
although I feel like the formula is a
little bit different for all of them so
if you guys can make up your mind as you
see me apply these colors but there were
a few that I don't suggest so I'll just
talk about those really fast out of
everything these five are the ones that
I just don't think you'll need the white
I don't think is meant to be alone if
you wear it alone you'll look insane
it's great for like a lightening one but
I would not suggest that alone purple
pause just didn't it I don't know it
just didn't apply like the rest of them
this is like a metallic formula I feel
like they have different formulas for
sure and this one's like has a metallic
sheen to it so I feel like it didn't get
as deep as I thought it would in here
and it's just not as pigmented as the
others kind of similar to this one but
this one's not metallic I just like the
other red in this collection better this
turned out to be like a lighter berry
than really deepening up to this red the
blue and the dark purple I think these
would be good lip products because they
are very
pigmented but only over like a lipliner
in a similar color or like a liquid
lipstick on their own I just don't think
that they're gonna look good they're
just they're this weird mix of like
being too pigmented um yeah just they
would look great over something but on
their own I don't think they look good
well I might as well just talk about all
of them I'm trying to go fast if you
can't tell just so this video isn't
super long but I'll leave a timestamp
for when the actual lip swatches start
the two nude shades are really pretty
I'm calling this like PG one more of
like a neutral because it's the closest
to neutral out of everything in here Kat
elope is what they call this one this is
so pretty but it has a bunch of gold
glitter in it and you can feel that
glitter I really wish it was the formula
of like this red one this one feels so
soft and plush it is a bit thick but it
does feel moisturizing I definitely get
the description of what they say on the
website in this color this one is called
9 to life so I do like that one I just
wish this was the same formula but it
has that gold glitter in it and I don't
I mean I still like it but I really wish
we got like a nice creamy more neutral
shade this one has a little bit of a
sheen to it it's not completely just a
cream but it's still really nice no
discernible like glitter and then I feel
like these ones all work out pretty
nicely I'm just I think kind of more
than anything surprised at how well
these look like how well they apply how
good they look on the lips again it's a
bit of a thicker formula so that might
throw you off it's nothing like my
favorites like the Gen nude ones from
bareMinerals the anasazi ones it's just
a bit of a different formula and then
this hot pink one has a metallic shift
to it but I find that it worked
I liked it on the lips so that's really
all I can give you as a review I don't
know about like longevity I haven't
tried out these products long enough to
do that but I did want to get some lip
swatches up and color swatches in case
you were interested you can see what
they look like on the lips I only have
these on my lips I don't have any like
fillers in my lips not that that
necessarily matters but just so you guys
know I'm also just a human so if the lip
swatches don't look that great I'm sorry
um I did my best I've never done a lip
swatches video before and I'm gonna do
two more right now my lips don't feel
too bad though like I'm like okay we can
do this I can do 24 more colors right I
did but
Queen takes just barely go over like my
lip line just so it looked refreshed and
every color got the best chance it could
I didn't find that these stained at all
for the time that I wore them so yeah I
hope that helps overall I think these
are nice I don't think like they're the
best class ever but I don't hate them
they're definitely more on the pigmented
side so if that's something you want I
would check them out maybe get one color
and see how you like the formula but I
will try to get you a more in-depth
review later on or let you know my
thoughts as I try these out more other
than that let's just get into swatches
so you can see what the colors are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
