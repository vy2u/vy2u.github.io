learn thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to give you some lip
swatches on the covergirl melting pout
let's read it exactly the new covergirl
melting pout matte liquid lipsticks I
have swatches coming at the end only the
time stamp because I do want to give a
tiny bit of a review this video is
mostly just to give you lip swatches
show you the color so you guys can just
have that information out there I
haven't worn all of these a long time I
can't give you a ton of information but
I'm going to tell you my experience thus
far and stay tuned on my channel if you
want to know more about it
these come in twelve different colors
and they have a good range of like
darker more fun colors and then some
neutrals they also have like almost like
a grey type of color too so they
definitely did a little bit different of
a line than I think other things out
there which is great the formula of this
is a moosie formula that is basically
like I would say a medium opacity these
remind me a lot of the wet and wild goth
or graphic lips so for me I like them
I'm not someone who wears a lot of
liquid lipsticks I just think that
they're drying these when you use a
light layer and you do more of the
lighter shades in the collection they
look really nice on the lips that's what
I'm wearing today they drive down matte
and they do stay transfer proof which is
awesome so I really like them the reason
that I like a sheer formula is because I
don't have to worry about having as
precise in the lip line that's like an
issue for me I'm not very good at that
you can build these up but I find that
they get a little bit more uncomfortable
that way they feel thicker on the lips I
just think if you can get just a nice
almost kind of like medium oh not sheer
because they're not sheer but you know
it's not going to be full on pigment but
they still look really nice and even I
think that that's the best way to go so
I do really enjoy the lighter colors
today I'm wearing the shade currant nude
and I really do like it I think it looks
great and you'll see in the swatches you
can make your own decisions when it
comes to the darker colors though
everything I like about them in the
lighter shades basically works against
having it in a darker formula or a
darker color they just don't build up
well I find that they're a little bit
patchy I just I don't feel comfortable
and confident wearing the darker shades
because I just feel like they're
constantly
even and so yeah that sucks you can
build them up but even then I find that
like it patches and it just those don't
work for me so if you're going to buy
these I definitely suggest the lighter
colors I personally actually really
enjoy those another thing I don't
totally love is the like scent on these
it's like a fruity scent but it's just
not something I enjoy
it's just weird I wish they would have
done vanilla or the same scent that they
have in the glosses which I do have a
swatch video on that and I will have
another one they're all gonna be
uploaded the same day I'm wearing the
same thing I'm just doing them separate
so people can find it the way they want
to I think that's all I have to say
about these um I I could read from the
website but who cares I did get these in
PR did I say that that's why I have so
many shades and yeah that's my thoughts
on them at least currently but more than
anything I did want this to be a lip
swatch and just color reference so I
hope you guys enjoy and let's get into
the lip swatches
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
