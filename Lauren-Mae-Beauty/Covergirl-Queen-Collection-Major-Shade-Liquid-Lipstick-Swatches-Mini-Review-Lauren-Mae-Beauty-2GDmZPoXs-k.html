Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm doing another lip swatch video
all of these are filmed on the same day
I'm gonna leave them all linked down
below but in this video I am swatching
all of the covergirl Queen collection
major shade liquid lipsticks these are
very similar to the melting pouch ones
that I did a video on as well I also
feel like the color selection is very
similar there are 12 shades in this
collection as well there are a few
brighter shades in here but overall I
feel like the range is some more neutral
colors there's like a gray toned a lot
of darker shades and then they have the
brights in here I feel like this formula
is super similar to the other one they
have the same taste and smell and I
basically feel the same way about them I
think that the lighter colors build up
really nicely this is a moosie texture
but it's kind of like this medium
opaqueness to it so with the lighter
shades it looks really great you can do
just a thin light layer and I feel like
it looks great on the lips it's
something I prefer I am NOT someone who
wears a lot of liquid lipsticks this
isn't meant to necessarily be a review
video it's meant to show you guys the
color so you have that information if
you were interested or just wanted to
see what colors they offer but just like
my mini review here I think these are
okay I think you should go for the
lighter shades the darker shades in this
range tend to work better for me for
building up but I just don't like the
way that this formula builds on itself I
find your just kind of trapped in this
loophole of continuously adding more
product because it looks patchy here and
then adding more product and then it
just gets out of control I will say you
will have better luck if you let the
layers dry in between that seems to help
I also think that these would work
really well like the darker shades if
you paired them over a lip liner to give
it some type of opaque base to go on top
of so that being said I like these again
the lighter colors are really nice I'm
gonna wear them I got these sent to me
with a bunch of the other things so I
thought this would be a great way to
show you guys the color so you can
hopefully make a better decision if this
was something on your list if you've
tried these and you have a review and
you've tried a ton of liquid lipsticks
leave it down below so we can all know
what you think and you know people can
get more information because that's what
I'm about just trying to give the info
for you to make the decisions I feel
like my intros for the lip swatches
we're different every time just so you
guys know this was the last bit I did
I did homage today my lips are hurting
not too bad actually
but you know if my lip application isn't
very nice I'm sorry also just so you
guys know like I don't have any fillers
or anything these are my natural lips so
that is what they're going on top of
just regular natural lips not that
there's anything wrong with either way
or whatever I just thought I'd give you
guys that info and I'm not very good at
doing my lip line as you can probably
tell in this video so anyway let's get
into lip swatches and what these look
like on the lips
also I'm wearing the shape rebel just so
you guys know okay let's get into
swatches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
