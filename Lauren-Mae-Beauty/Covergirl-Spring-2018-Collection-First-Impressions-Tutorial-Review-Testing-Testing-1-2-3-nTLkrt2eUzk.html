Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing another testing
testing one two three
I have some new covergirl products for
these for in 2018 collection they sent
over an insane PR package if you follow
other Beauty gears and you might have
seen it like that's the one I got Who am
I so it is a ton of products it's their
entire new line so I wanted to try to
use as many products in this series so I
can give you guys some feedback I'm also
going to be doing some lip swatch
specific video so look out for those
coming soon but yeah if you haven't seen
this style a video for me before this is
where I do a first impressions which is
the one I do a tutorial just creating
some type of look which is number two
and then at the end I come back and give
you guys some reviews on the products
that I've tested I'm not only testing
them obviously in the videos but outside
and other times and stuff so I'd like to
try to give you as much information as
possible I will have time stamps because
this is probably gonna be a hella long
video but other than that let's get into
it I'm bare face because literally there
are so many freaking new products in
this line I think we've all kind of seen
that covergirl is kind of rebranding
themselves and everything which i think
is really cool just you guys know all
prices are gonna be listed in the
description box as well as everything
that I'm using whether it's covergirl or
not I'm gonna start off using the
covergirl vitalists go glow luminizing
lotion I'm gonna basically be using this
as a primer it came in two different
shades in my package so there's this one
and then there's a darker one as well
hmmm
this kind of has like a floral a corn
chip kind of smell to it then it kinda
weird I definitely think it gave my skin
a glow it's kind of like a lotion II
glow though and not necessarily like a
sparkle which is nice I like that I feel
hydrated and let's move on to I think
foundations next for me this is not
cover girls obviously they didn't have
any foundation coming out with this line
but I have the soft focus satin matte
foundation from Sonia Kashuk I'm going
to get my face done and we'll come back
and start on the next product so I just
did a light layer of foundation and I
will say I already
frickin missed using a product I wanted
to use this before I went in but that's
how much color correcting is not a part
of my routine so I will be using this
maybe I'll try using it in the tutorial
just so you guys can see it in action
I'm gonna zoom this in because we're
gonna go in with concealer next and I
want you guys to see what this looks
like on the skin
obviously the foundation again isn't
from them but you can just kind of see
how it's going so this is what the skin
looks like hopefully you guys can see I
try to focus as best as I can but I have
manual focus I am like so close to
getting a new camera guys for simplest
so out of the whole package obviously
there's gonna be stuff that they just
send but this is something I was
genuinely excited about like for myself
this is the covergirl vilest healthy
concealer I do like pen concealers but
they tend to go pretty fast this is the
lightest shade I'm not sure how many
shades there are they sent over like I
think six different shades but I don't
know if I got more of like the lighter
colors or not so I will leave all that
information again in the description box
I have not used this I did like swatch
it but this is very yellow and yeah it's
it's like very yellow to me we'll see
how it blends out domine is my big
wonder I don't expect this to have a ton
of coverage honestly and that's
something I was excited about for it
because I do like something a little bit
more hydrating and something that has
more of like a medium coverage I
definitely think it's like brighter
underneath my eye definitely doesn't
have a lot of coverage and it is a bit
more moisturizing I'll have to see up
close for a second so off for first
impressions I do like it it definitely I
could have just the tiniest bit more
coverage for me but I do like it I like
something a bit more natural though so
we'll see as I wear it more how it works
into other foundations and things
alright so next we're going to go in
with a highlighter these are the
vitalists healthy glow illuminators
they're a cream Pot formula they kind of
look like the Maybelline Color tattoos
in packaging they sent over six
different shades but I felt like these
were the ones that would suit me best so
I have number three which is the darkest
one I'm not sure if I'm going to use
that one and
I've wanted to imagine that I'm pretty
pale well one's just kind of sparkly and
two is more of like a white gold I think
for this look today I'm gonna go with
the gold one and then for the tutorial
I'll use the other one I am gonna try it
two different ways I'm going to be just
putting my baby blunder straight into it
and seeing what kind of finish we can
get that way oh yeah I picked up a
little this is definitely gonna give
more of like I guess a subtle glow and
also it has this one has a bit of like a
glitter to it so there's that as well
I'm gonna use my fingers for the other
side it's almost it's like a mix between
a jelly almost and a like cream it's
kind of a weird formula oh yeah finger
application is a lot more dense I think
I like the finger better I think it
leaves the sheen of it on butter where
is this I feel like almost the only
thing left is the glitter I'm gonna put
a little bit down my nose a little my
Cupid's bow or a lot I'm going to add a
little with my finger on this side that
we use this sponge yeah this is just
like way softer of a glow and more like
the glow is coming from sparkle where is
this just like more like a cream product
so far technique-wise I would suggest
using your fingers I'm excited to see
how those will work over powders though
too so I will be testing out later on so
for powder today I'm going to be using
the vitalist healthy powder and this is
in the shade classic ivory this is the
last one they sent over so we'll see how
this works on my skin I'm just gonna go
in with a more fluffy brush than I
normally do I usually use loose powders
so I want to use a big fluffy brush just
to not pack it on too much and then I
decided that I'm just gonna use this to
set under my eyes as well so I'm taking
a smaller brush and just lightly
fluffing that under the eye this is
definitely a little too dark for me I
definitely want to go down a shade at
least if not too so hopefully they have
more shades on what they sent texture
wise though I think that my skin looks
nice I think it's a nice powder so far
we'll see how it holds up I think before
I go in with like bronzer and all that
might as well just do the eyes since
we're zoomed in and everything they have
a new eye primer this is the covergirl
lid lock up so I'm gonna use that and
see what it's like it's like a doe foot
I feel like I'm pretty much down with a
lot of primers like I have oily lids so
I definitely need a primer but a lot of
them work this one feels pretty nice on
the lids it's nice and smooth
and it gets like slightly tacky nothing
like too much
oh yeah it's pretty tacky like my
eyelids feel like they're sticking
together a little bit um so let's powder
that down really fast I did like the
overall feeling I just you know think
you should definitely set this one or
it'll claim to shadow so for eyebrows
they had two different types of products
to have a very skinny little eyebrow
pencil which I am excited to try that's
probably the only one I'm gonna use
today but they do have a pomade that's
in the set I'm not used to using a
pomade so I don't think for my first
impressions I always like to just like
grab the things that I'm most drawn to
and then I test out the other thing so I
can let you know but I will try the
pomade out and see how it goes in report
back this is the shade blonde and I'm
excited to see how it works for my
coloring so far so good I love that it's
so skinny and that they didn't come out
with you know something too thick or
kind of different it's like they just
gave us like a nice staple I like that a
lot
alright overall that was pretty easy to
do the color is nice and like an ashy
blonde it's not like too warm or
anything which i think is nice it's like
this in-between it's kind of waxy of a
pencil overall I really like this stuff
art and I definitely will be using this
again like I want to use it again
and we just get into the eye shadows
already I am super excited this is the
katie-cat palette there are two
different ones there's this one and then
there's one that's a lot more colorful
so I thought I would go with the more
neutral look today we're gonna stick to
this quad I want to use this on the lid
and just do kind of a pretty simple
bronze eye so I'm gonna go in with the
lightest matte shade which I'm so glad
that's a matte there seems to be a good
mix of like matte or at least satins
that can work as Matt so I'm gonna be
buffing this into the crease it is a bit
powdery so there's that but I don't
really mind that too much in a shadow I
just like to tell you guys I also think
that pigmentation is really nice on this
product and it also is blending out
really nicely so I think that's nice and
built up I'm going to go in with the
middle shade which is a really pretty
bronze and I'm gonna use a flat shader
brush and they do have a setting spray
that came out so I'm gonna just go
straight in and foil it from swatches
these seemed really nice but they were a
bit powdery so I'm hoping that we can
get some nice metallic sheen with the
setting spray it's pretty I like it it's
not I was like melted as I want it to
look but I think it's nice I also have
quite a bit of fallout I'm gonna try to
spray my brush really well so it's like
super wet to see if we can get something
to really foil
I think that definitely helped like the
wetter the brushes the more foiled the
shadows gonna be so I'd like the way
that's looking on the lids it's pretty
metallic but it does have some like
glitter sparkle in it as well so keep
that in mind I'm gonna go in with this
brown shade here and I'm just going to
be adding that into the outer corner
just for some depth I think it looks
pretty good I don't want to get too dark
and smoky but I will say this is a
difference like this one is really
powdery where this one didn't kick up
nearly as much powder so let's do the
inner corner really fast I'm just gonna
be using this small little Sigma brush
and we're going in with the pink shade
in here and I'm just gonna add a little
bit of brightness to the inner corner I
like the shine that that gave us nice
let's finish this out with going under
the lash line with the first matte brown
shade that we used I think that looks
pretty good overall I'm not like blown
away but I think it looks nice you know
it's not like bad they did come out with
some liquid liners and I'm gonna go for
it guys we're using the teal one today
this is in the shade 340 but they have a
couple different black ones I think they
might have different finishes this is
what the brush looks like so really nice
definitely something way different than
the stupid wet and wild ones that I
hated so much so I am going to do my
best to stay in focus and do my eyeliner
sorry about the beeping again hopefully
we can get something decent say a little
prayer for me
all right so that's a pretty decent
thing right guys I'm pretty happy with
that I'm gonna try the other side see
how we go so here is where we are I did
my best
I definitely got it all over my lashes
but not nearly as bad as other time so
you can tell that it's teal but it's not
too crazy teal I think taking into
account the fact that I'm not very good
at these types of liners makes it like
if you are good at these you might
really like this color while we're here
let's just move on to mascara and see
how this goes this is the covergirl
peacock flare mascara ooh
the wand is interesting
I do like actual oh yeah I got in my
lashes and I tried to get it off but my
gosh I couldn't
so those are the lashes covered in
mascara this was not my favorite lash
application for sure I'm going to give
it the benefit of the doubt and say that
it's because of the liner but I will say
this brush has been really difficult
because the ends like I usually use the
end to kind of like get in but I felt
like I couldn't really get close to my
lashes so we'll see we'll see so far oh
I hate my lashes so much right now
alright guys so I'm gonna zoom out we
are going to finish up the face finish
up the lip but I do want to show you
right now look at this highlighter I
don't like it either so far I don't like
the way that powder sits on top of it I
don't I just don't like the way it looks
so far so well okay anyway but let's
move on
so for bronzer I thought I'd go in with
one of the face powders that they sent
over this is the shade warm beige and
then this one is the shade medium beige
so I might just kind of like mix between
the two one of them looks a little bit
warm for me
so I'm gonna be using medium beige I do
think the texture of this powder is nice
if they have a light enough shade for me
I think it's you know a nice one
especially if you like a pressed powder
and don't want to fuss around with a
loose one feel like my forehead looks a
little tan so much try to combat that
that's kind of like what I do looking at
my face zoomed out I think I look really
pretty I think it's just kind of like to
get here was a little bit hard on some
things so I'm going in with a dark lip
today I know this is the spring
collection but I thought going in with
the black would be fun I really wish
they had a teal that I could match the
liner with and that's what I would do
but yeah I think I'm gonna go in with
the black one just I want to see how it
works I want to see how the pigmentation
is so this is the covergirl Queen
collection Maj shade liquid lipstick so
fingers crossed it goes well
all right so that is one coat don't mind
my horrible horrible lip line it is
sheer for sure but I it looks promising
potentially that you could build it up
to a second layer and get full opacity
so that's what we're going to go in for
we're gonna hope that we can get it to
be a little bit more opaque
that's two coats I'm trying to kill it
then touch all they dry sexy I know
while that's drying I might as well let
my face dry after setting my setting
spray so this is the covergirl look lock
up and I'm gonna spray my face the
sprayer is pretty nice and this smells
kind of like a conditioner like a
detangler or something like I feel like
I'm spraying detangler on my face or
something just definitely like a hair
product of some sort it's not like bad
it's just yeah
definitely something I've smelled before
some other time all right now that my
hair is soaked this is the look lip wise
okay I do like it I think it went on
pretty opaque like I'm I'm happy but
this has like a very like light moosie
texture it's not one of those movies
that feels really heavy on the lips it
almost kind of goes on sheer too and I
have used a couple of the other ones and
I feel like it's very similar so yeah I
will get back to you on formula on that
but overall I'm not a liquid lipstick
connoisseur I don't know a ton about
them they're not something I wear on the
everyday but I like this I think it
built up nicely for a black from the
drugstore but anyway let's move on to
the tutorial portion of the video
all right guys what's up we are onto the
second part of this video which is this
tutorial so I'm going to be starting
with my eyes today because I have been
using this stuff and I found with the
eyeshadows that they are pigmented which
is nice but they have a lot of little
tiny sparkles in them like every single
shade that isn't matte even the matte
ones kind of have some sparkle so we're
gonna start with eyes I mean we going in
with brows first I will say that I did
try using the other brow product in here
the pomade and I don't like that product
I will say that pomades
aren't something that I normally use so
there is gonna be like a bit of a
learning curve for me that one just
isn't really a win for me personally so
I'm just gonna fill in my whole brow
using this pencil those are brows done I
did them pretty fast pretty happy about
that so we're moving onto the primer for
the eyelids this is a covergirl lid
block I've been using this quite a bit
and I do like this product I think that
it works well especially specifically
with the formula of shadows that they
put
which makes sense since it's the same
brand I think that this product
potentially could be breaking my eyelid
l which I know is like really weird I
had quite a few like little whiteheads
over here I had a couple here they've
seemed to go away and I have been using
this everyday so I'm not sure what it's
from because I haven't been plucking my
eyebrows and that's usually how I would
get those I'm gonna keep using it and
see if they kind of like come back or
what's happening but that was something
that did happen we are gonna be going
into both of the palettes today I'm
gonna be going into this palette though
first the dilemma I keep having is I
really like this eyeshadow base for
these shadows like the shimmery shades
so there's not as much fallout but I
also like to have something where I can
easily blend color on to the crease of
the eye so I keep running into like do I
set it do I not but I am gonna set my
lid today just because I don't want the
blending to be affected the first color
I'm gonna be going in with is this Brown
which is what we use in the first look I
find that this shade is quite pigmented
and you don't need a lot of it I do like
this color I'm glad it's included in
this palette so I'm just going to be
building up a transition with this one
so there we are with the crease I'm
gonna go in now with the matte shade
next to it and just like a smaller
blending brush I'm gonna go in with this
shade here and we're going to be putting
this on the inner and outer corner of
the eye
I feel like this Brown shades not gonna
make quite as much depth as it seems
like it would in the pan but it is
blending out nicely I'm going in with a
smaller brush just to add the halo on
the inside portion of the eye I find
that I like to use detailed brushes in
this area because if not I have quite
you know small eyelids it can just get a
little bit messy and crazy I think that
looks pretty good as a base now we're
gonna go into the fun palette and I
think I'm just gonna lay down a little
bit more of the primer almost like a
glitter glue just in that center part of
the eye and just blend it out really
nicely so that way that eye shadow is
gonna stick I want to see what its gonna
do without foiling because I find that
when I foil these shadows I I don't know
like the sparkle and fun-ness of a kind
of dies and it's not super shiny because
it's not quite a metallic so I'm just
trying to find a way to best make these
shadows shine the way they should and
they leave you look in the pan but it's
been difficult my god my voice I feel
like in every video my voice is just
shot I'm gonna use that small brush
again I'm just gonna like wipe it off
and we're gonna go into the darkest
green shade here these are very strange
formulas I found like they're pigmented
which is what I appreciate but they
definitely kind of like chunk up and I
don't know in the pan they're kind of
weird but I do think overall they
perform really nicely on the eye so I'm
just gonna be covering the entire lid I
mean that's me not foiling it and just
using the base and the brush I mean
that's amazing pigmentation I'm very
very impressed so I'm just gonna tap a
little on with my finger just to get
again the most pigmentation but honestly
it looks great we're gonna go back into
the hot cat palette I'm going in with
the brown the light brown and we're just
going to be going over the edges and
just kind of deepening them up and
blending the colors together I do think
I want to play with the black in this
palette though kind of deepen up the
edges so we're gonna go in with this and
a pretty small brush and we're just
going to put it on the outer and inner
part of this halo I
and now that I have that black laid down
I'm just gonna go in with our fluffy
original blending brush and just blend
over the edges to try to have a seamless
of a look as we can I will say I'm
really happy with how this turned out so
far I think I like the blending so far I
will say I have quite a bit of fallout
so I'm really glad that I chose to do my
eyes first this is definitely not
something I like to do or usually do but
I think it looks nice I'm gonna go in
just one more time and really make sure
that this green is poppin before we go
in with just a little bit of the other
color I mean that pigmentation is like I
feel like a high-end palate so okay I'm
going in with the lighter shade now and
I'm just going to kind of like tap that
on the center of the lid it went a
little bit more than just the center cuz
my finger is super big I guess so I
still really like it though
I'm going to clean up the fallout on my
face and we will start on the rest of
the face with other products all right
so I have the fallout wiped away we're
gonna go on with the primer or like
illuminator type of product this is
really nice I still do like it the smell
still smells like freaking like a bag of
Fritos seriously we just need some bean
dip up in here so we're gonna do a step
that I forgot to do in the first part of
the video and this is using the true
blend pre touching palette I don't know
why they came out with this honestly
color correcting isn't as big of a fad
now so I don't understand it but I'm
gonna go in with my Beauty Blender and
just kind of counteract the areas where
I have the most redness which is my
cheeks I also have quite a bit on my
nose and you can already see it going
away the trick with color correctors is
to not use too much it should just be
taining the color and counteracting it
you should not see the actual color on
your skin like overall I think it worked
fine and nice this isn't something that
I think I would reach for normally I
don't normally color correct for redness
on my face but I think it worked and I'm
happy with the way it feels and I like
the way I applied it so yes it worked
I'm going in with one other color
correcting step though because the
concealer in this set is very
very light coverage I do find that if I
can color correct some of the darkness
then it doesn't have as much work to do
and I can kind of get away with having
that lighter coverage concealer without
it looking like a light coverage
concealer for foundation today I'm using
my depotted Lancome tint Edel foundation
this is one of my favorites I'm just
going to be buffing that all over and I
really don't have much to correct
because the green did take a lot of the
redness down so I'm just gonna do a
light layer all over the skin we're
moving on to concealer and I can't even
tell you what shade this is because it
doesn't have it on there and I don't
know if that's because I got the pro
ones but I don't have shades on any of
them so I don't know which ones lightest
which ones the next lightest they look
like identical in the tube
I can't tell you what color this is I'll
do my best in post to add it in the
description but I'm just putting that
anywhere I would put concealer normally
this is a very yellow which is fine
because it is so sheer it tends to like
sheer out fine but it's yellow the
powders in here are way too dark for my
skin I'm pretty sure that they oxidized
a bit as well so I will not be setting
my face with that powder just because I
want my makeup to look good yeah so I'm
going to be putting on my Maybelline fit
me loose powder I'm gonna set my whole
face and then we'll move on to bronzers
and blushes for bronzer today I am gonna
use one of the powders in the darker
shade this is the color medium beige and
I'm going to just see how this works by
itself without the darker face powder
and the bronzer this powder is nice it's
very like soft and I think it looks
really nice on the skin I just need a
right shade
I think bronzer looks pretty good we're
gonna go in with blush this is the
Clinique cheek poppin nude blush I
thought this would go nice with the look
I thought I was gonna go more fun and
like colorful but I don't know I just
didn't so it's kind of hard because I
don't want to put too colorful of a look
or a lip on with this so we're probably
gonna go nude but I will put the links
to the lip swatches once I have those
videos up so you can see what the other
color
the range look like we're now moving on
to the highlighter I was not a fan of
this last time and I will say since then
I've used it twice I'm still not a huge
fan this is a different color this is in
the shade one the other one I used is in
the shade two and the way I've found
best to apply this is to apply it on top
of your powders with a beauty blender
and just stipple it on where you want it
it lets the actual shine of the
highlighter actually come through
instead of only the sparkle I'm just
going to be putting this in all the
places that I would normally highlight I
also think this color works a little bit
better for me it's not as golden and
then that's what it looks like I'm gonna
put on my eyeliners I'm gonna put white
on my waterline and black on my tight
line and I'll be back we're gonna be
moving on to the lower lash line before
we go in with mascara I'm just gonna go
into the matte shades we used from the
hot cat palette so that warm brown I'm
gonna put under the eye and then kind of
like melt it into the outer corner then
I'm gonna take the darker Brown on the
palette and then just put that on the
outer corner and I'm just buffing out
with a bigger brush I think for the
inner corner I'm gonna go in with that
shade we put on the center of the lid
and just just that lightly on the inner
corner just to bring some fun pizazz to
this look I am for a little bit more fun
and sparkle I'm going in with this elf
liner in the shade seafoam and I'm just
gonna put this on the bottom lash line
at the first part of the inner corner
I'm going in with the covergirl peacock
flare mascara this has been a struggle
for me I don't love it but I am
continuing to try to make it work
alright that's the best I could do with
the mascara I'm gonna wipe away a little
bit of fallout and we'll go in with the
lip for my look today I didn't know what
I wanted to do I'm kind of like torn
between these two these two these two
gosh I kind of want to do this just to
see what it's like and then I can always
do this this one probably will be the
most like pretty with it
I feel like geez might be a little too
light like they'd still be pretty but
they're a little bit light I'll try it
I'm gonna try it this is the color clean
slate this is from the Queen collection
the major shade these need like a light
layer I do like this color but I've
definitely
to work to build it up to this opacity
and to make sure my chocolate and top
lip and bottom lips look the same so I'm
gonna let that dry and I'll be back
I'm also gonna spray my face hello all
right Kay so here is the final look I do
like the lip I like the lip color it's
something a little different I probably
will change it out for the videos I'm
gonna film after this but I think it
looks kind of cool I'm glad I did
something different with the look
because I did want to try just a
different color out this is not normally
something I would wear yeah I think
that's it so I'm gonna try to step out a
little bit longer what you guys won't
see and then let's get into the last
portion of this which is the final
review my thoughts on these products
after I've tested them and whether I
think you should buy them or not let's
go alright hi guys we are on to the
third portion of this video this has
been a long video in the making
obviously you've seen the other two
parts by now but I filmed those probably
a good almost two weeks ago so I've been
testing this stuff out probably for a
good month on and off with other
products but I definitely feel like this
covergirl stuff has been in my life a
really long time I'm excited to let you
guys know my thoughts I'm gonna start
with the stuff that I really like first
we'll get into the mess and then we'll
get into the Misses the first product I
want to talk about is the covergirl
vitalists go glow luminizing lotion this
comes in two shades and I was using the
shade number one daybreak and I really
like this I hate the smell it smells
freaking weird because it's like corn
chips and only Noelle mentioned that and
it's just true like you put this on your
face and you smell Fritos but the actual
product is really really nice it has a
bit of a luminosity to it it does have a
bit of a sparkle but it's nothing that's
going to accentuate any pores it's not
gonna accentuate lines it just makes you
look super radiant and glowy and just
beautiful um if you have oily skin and
you don't want to get oily throughout
the day this might not be the perfect
like product for you but if you like a
glow or if you have dry skin I think
this would work great I've really been
enjoying it it's something that after
testing all these things out I want to
use afterward and I think that's
something like I'm realizing as I have
been given more product to test out that
testing it out and giving you guys
reviews is great but what are the
products that I'm actually gonna like
wanna use after like the testing out
period is done and this is
one of those products they really like
it I just wish it smelled different this
reminds me a lot of the Becca purple
primer I can't remember if that's
backlight or first light I think it's a
backlight primary highway I think it's
really beautiful and I highly suggested
so if you're like looking for something
like this I think you'll like it
the next product that I liked was the
brow pencil this is the ultra fine brow
pencil this is the color soft blonde and
I believe it comes in three other shades
I really do like the fine tip on this
you can really get a nice precise brow
it is a bit waxy so you can get a bit of
product build up but I don't really mind
that I feel like this is more similar to
the elf inste lift brow pencil in
formula than it is to my other favorite
which is the color pop brow boss if you
don't like something waxy you want
something a little bit harder and
something that's not going to deposit as
much product this might not be for you I
do like this I'm gonna finish it up I
don't know if I'd repurchase it only
because I already have kind of like my
Holy Grails and they're so cheap so it's
like this would have to be like 99 cents
for me to be like oh yeah I'd buy that
over it but I did enjoy it and it worked
nicely and the more I used it the more I
liked it I also felt like the color is
really nice for blondes it's not too
like yellow it's not too warm it's not
too ashy I just thought it was nice and
I think this is kind of like the last
product that I thought was like just a
solid good product that I enjoyed this
is the eye primer and I had mentioned in
one of the videos how I thought it was
maybe breaking my eyelids out but I
don't know I haven't had problems and
I've literally been using it every
single day since that video I took this
with me to Oregon and used it everyday
there so like I've been using this
product well over two weeks and I
haven't had that same issue so it must
have just been a weird thing I like this
a lot because it's a very sticky primer
and that's not gonna be for everyone but
something that I do really like about it
is I really do feel like it like holds
onto shadows and specifically I think
this goes well with the eyeshadows in
this collection and just like the
formula that I've been dealing with with
these shadows so I do like this I think
it works nice it's like this in-between
of a primer and also like a glitter glue
like it has a lot of tack to it I do
like it I think it holds onto shadows
really well
I like the
with applicator of it and it works
really nicely again with the eyeshadow
so that's what we'll talk about next
we're getting into products that I think
are like okay they're maybe not the
worst you just have like pros and cons
and they're just gonna depend on what
you're looking for what your collection
looks like but they didn't necessarily
like blow me out of the water let's just
talk about some of the eyeshadow they
sent over the smokey and honestly I
didn't get to use this much only a
couple colors it's just not my favorite
color selection wise I feel like there's
a lot of like similar tones and there's
not enough like tonal variation like I
want some mid-tones some light tones and
some dark tones and they're kind of all
like mid and dark so you're definitely
getting a smoky palette with that one as
for the ones though that I did test way
more these are the katie-cat palette
eyes and one is hot cat which is like
the neutral and one is cool cat which
are the more glittery and fun colors for
this palette I found that I use this
like brown shade quite often also the
darker Brown I did a whole look using
these mauve colors ones I think these
are nice shadows but they're very
powdery and they're also very shimmery
there are the two mats but even then
they have a little bit of a sheen to
them like there's a little bit they're
not like a true matte to me I think
these can work well I do think that you
need to be careful with them because
they can turn muddy pretty fast like if
you're just like blending like crazy
they kind of all blend into each other
again because they are so powdery I
really do like the shimmer shades though
on top of that sticky primer just
straight on don't set it whatever just
go in with your finger and put it on it
looks really great you can also use
these with a setting spray or with mac
fix+ or just something to put them on
wet and I feel like they're very
impactful and I think they look really
pretty so I mean if these are something
you were looking at you know then yeah
try them out but they definitely do have
a different formula this is the one that
I think is like different enough that
maybe you could pick up again if you
like something like this it is so
sparkly and so beautiful it really is so
pretty I just barely touched my finger
and look at the powder kick up
in the pan again it's beautiful though
it's so pretty and putting that on a
sticky base where it's really gonna
capture it it looks so pretty it's just
definitely a different formula so I
would definitely suggest using some type
of glitter glue some type of sticky base
when you're using these products to
really get them to perform and I think
you could make some amazing eye looks
but I do think you need just that little
bit of extra care you need to be a
little bit more careful with blending so
you don't blend everything away and you
don't blend everything into each other
but I do think that they work and I do
think that they offer something
different than what I've seen because
the colors in here are really pretty the
sparkle aspect in here is really
beautiful it's just it definitely has
its pros and it's cons so I will
probably end up keeping this one from
the collection and I'll probably be
passing these two on just to give you
guys you know kind of where I'm at next
let's talk about the concealer as you
can tell I have used quite a bit of this
there isn't I mean it's got up pretty
high in the container oh I have a
love-hate relationship with this part of
me really likes it this is going to give
you a pretty light coverage though so if
you're looking for something that's
really concealing this is not it this is
more of like a moisturizing formula so
it's a little bit of a thicker formula
with less coverage and that isn't just
always my favorite I'm wearing it today
I've been wearing it quite often I'm
definitely gonna finish this up but I
got I think like five and the PR package
and I will be passing those on before I
even open them to other people so that
they can try it out see if they like it
it's not something that I would purchase
it's not a horrible product I just don't
think that it's gonna work for a lot of
people I don't think it's everyone's cup
of tea again if you're looking for
something super moisturizing with not a
lot of coverage this is your thing but
if you're not which most people aren't
it's just you know there are other
things better in the drugstore so the
color selection on this - this was very
yellow so if you are someone with a lot
of pink undertones you will not like
this I like these a lot actually these
are kind of in the more like than the
men these are the liquid eyeliners I'm
wearing this like teal green one today
you have to make sure you shake these up
so the pigment gets incorporated if you
don't they're not going to be super
pigmented but if you do they are so
pretty so I am wearing the
Jade 340 on my eyes today it's the one I
used in the first impressions and I
really do like it I think it's really
pretty I don't use the brush on these I
use the Sigma O six winged liner brush I
think it is so I just puts them out on
my hand and use it as a palette and use
it that way just so I can have a little
bit more control and that's just because
of me and how I am with freaking using
eyeliners I'm just not good at these
like liquid eyeliners where you don't
get a lot of like space to do it I'm
just not good at but um they have quite
a few different colors they have a black
and then they have a shiny black so I'm
going to tell you which one's the shiny
one now because I know that is not
everyone's cup of tea a lot of people
don't want shiny black all right if you
were looking for that matte black you
want to get 320 and if you want like a
shiny black 325 so I do like these I
think they're nice if you're good at
winged liner you will like the felt tip
on these two I believe they're very thin
very like precise I just am not good at
it personally the formula though is
really great it doesn't move it doesn't
transfer it stays in place so I really
do like these and the blacks are super
pigmented there's a few swatches and
then just to kind of give you an idea of
what the tip looks like that is the tip
so it's super thin and you really can
get some nice precision with that
another product that's kind of in the
more I have some loves I have some Hanes
so it's not even a matte products it's
just like I don't like everything we're
gonna be talking about all the lip
products I did a whole lip swatch video
on all three of the different lines that
are in here so definitely check those
out on leave a link down below we're
gonna talk about the katie-cat glosses
first I am wearing the shade right now a
9th life it's like a red and it's really
pretty I will say though these are super
pigmented so you got to be careful I had
some like kind of like in the corners of
my mouth I felt like it was getting
everywhere so I took a lot of product
away from that area
the really pigmented colors are honestly
not something you're gonna want to wear
every day they're just not an everyday
lip product so they're definitely for a
specific event they're for pictures like
they are just for short-term things the
formula on these are a bit thicker you
do kind of have to dip into the
container a couple of times to get out
enough product to coat the whole lip
I've heard
we'll call these sticky and I don't
agree with that they're not sticky like
my lips right now do not feel sticky
it's just a thick gloss and they do talk
about that on the on the website and I
think that they do a good job of
describing it it's a thicker gloss but
it feels moisturizing it doesn't feel
sticky like I feel like my buxom White
Russian is stickier than these are for
sure I do like them some of the darker
colors though aren't my favorite I would
say that my two favorites are the two
like lighter colors we have tabby tees
which is a nice like coral which I will
wear again and then we have cats elope
which is a really pretty more neutral
shade but it does have a lot of gold and
glitter in it and you can't feel that in
the lip gloss so that's something to
keep in mind other than that the only
two colors I think that I'm going to be
keeping besides I'll probably keep the
red one I will be keeping kitty caramel
which is really pretty it's like a
metallic hot pink and then I really
liked candy cat which was a like baby
Balcom blue toned pink other than that I
probably will be passing on the other
ones so these are just something like if
you really wanted to try this formula
you wanted to try this color or
something
pick up one see if you like it and go
from there but they're not anything that
I'm like raving about you know on to all
of the liquid lipsticks now I have not
tried every single one of these well
actually I have I did the whole lip
swatch video but I haven't worn all of
these long-term but I will say that I
think that both the formulas are very
similar when it comes to the Queen Maj
shade ones and when it comes to the
melting pouch formula like they're the
same thing I don't know why they came
out with two different lines but they
did I love all of the neutrals I think
they're so pretty I will be keeping all
of those I think they're so great this
formula has a medium opacity to it it is
like very similar to the NYX soft matte
lip cream so I really like the way that
these like medium shades go on the
lighter shades go on the lips you can
put a light layer on they cover the lips
nicely it doesn't feel like I'm wearing
a mask on my lips
they aren't over drying I really do like
this formula in these colors and I can
get away with wearing some of these more
mid-tone colors as well I think they're
so great
but when it comes to the darker shades
they just don't they're a little bit
more patchy on me but someone did
mention in my lip swatch video which i
think is interesting that these might
look better on people with darker skin
since their lips are darker so I would
love to know if you've tried these out
if you have darker skin how these have
worked for you because that could be a
really good positive with this formula
because I do like the formula I like the
medium opacity I'm not someone who likes
to wear really opaque lips I don't know
there's something about like the lip
line I just like having a softer lip
line and all that so yeah I I do like
these I think that if you were
interested you should try one and see
how it goes be aware of the darker shade
so maybe he's a lip liner and see if
that will help but I love I really
really truly love the lighter neutral
shades those are so pretty and I even
wore the black and I mean I could get it
to work don't get me wrong it was just a
little bit more fussy than maybe I'd
want it to be but I mean it still worked
don't get me wrong you can layer these
up I feel like and you could make it
work I just think they work best they
are their prime formula and like
situation when they are in like the more
neutral lighter shades at least on my
skin tone I have two more like met
products so the next ones are the
powders now I got the face powder in 710
classic ivory now I don't know if this
is like one of the lighter shades but
this is like too dark for me I wore it
in the initial Tryon video and I didn't
think it was too bad but like throughout
the day this turned I think it might
have oxidized I don't know maybe it just
I just realized how dark it actually was
but it just it's too dark for me so I
could not wear this as a face powder
after that but I do think this is a nice
face powder it's super silky it
definitely is going to give you some
coverage if you were into like the
L'Oreal True Match I feel like this is a
very similar powder to that like in
texture and just how it feels this is
also a powder though that I find doesn't
control my oils you know the ones I feel
like there are ones that make you look
so beautiful and airbrushed and so Matt
and like perfect they add that coverage
all that but I don't find that they
actually like hold up throughout the day
and that's kind of one of these to me so
I will be passing this powder on and
then I did use one of my darker shades
though as a
I'm wearing it as a bronzer today this
is the shade medium beige the fact that
medium beige is a bronzer that's so fair
I am but this I actually really like I
like the way my bronzer looks today so I
will be keeping this in my bronzer
collection
I think the powder itself is a really
nice texture and consistency I just
think you need to find the right color
for you and last form it and like okay
products this is the covergirl look lock
up all day setting mist this is a nice
mist it has like a nice like you know
you can kind of push it down the whole
way of a sprayer which is really great
it's very fine this smells like a hair
conditioner like a detangler or I don't
know something like that yeah it
definitely has a kind of a strange scent
it smells good like I feel like a lot of
people would like it but to me it also
smells kind of like weird I just feel
like I'm spraying my face down with
detangler I don't find that this like
makes my makeup stay on any longer
it also doesn't give me like too much of
a melting effect so I'll probably finish
this bundle up honestly
but I wouldn't purchase it I will say
though I don't think that I have ever
found one that really keeps my makeup on
any longer I don't know I still get oily
like I don't know I didn't none of them
do that for me so yeah if you've had
experience with this let us know down in
the comments this is just like a okay
like I'll spray my face at the end of
the makeup application but nothing good
or bad either way except that the mist
is fine that is positive I like that and
now let's get into this products that
just did not work for me I did not like
them no this is probably the saddest one
for me it just they just don't look very
good I'm wearing it today on my
cheekbones and it might look really good
on camera sometimes I like it but they
are so glittery I am wearing the number
one this is just like a white cream it
has so much sparkle to it I've tried
using these a bunch of different ways
I've used it on like foundation right
after it's applied before I go in with
powder I've used this with a brush I've
used this with my fingers I've used it
with a sponge and my favorite way to
apply these is on top of like my
finished makeup after I've set it with
powder and everything with a sponge damp
sponge and put that on to the places you
want to put highlighter that's the best
way I will be keeping this because I do
like it for like specific things but it
is very glittery it's definitely not an
everyday highlighter I don't think this
is going to be anyone's favorite the
consistency and texture of it is just
kind of weird you definitely have to
like do specific things to make this
work I really don't suggest the number
to one it's like a gold it's like a
white one with like a gold reflex and I
just did not like the way this looked on
the skin I felt like it looked kind of
like cakey and just sparkly I did use
this one though
underneath powder and I didn't like the
way that looked you cannot put powder
over this then all that comes through is
the sparkle instead of like the more
like highlighter shiny part you know and
it's just like whywhy can you just made
these like with the sheen and not that
like glitter Sparkle I don't know why
they did that I really wish they came
out with some pressed powder
highlighters that were just beautiful I
feel like as much as people love the
Maybelline chrome one or whatever and we
love the wet and wild ones there's
definitely still some room for brands to
have some good highlighters powder
highlighters at the drugstore so I
wanted to like these so bad but I just
didn't and then I did touch one more so
today I was like you know what I'm gonna
use it on the eye so that's what I have
on my lids today this is the shade
number three and it's beautiful this is
such a beautiful color I'm probably
gonna keep this 1 to 4 on the eyelids
because I really do like it and I just
put a primer down so I don't think it's
going to crease that's what that hand
motion was so yeah I don't suggest
anyone to buy them I can't tell you with
good conscience to be like go out and
buy these I think if you already have
them and you're like stuck with them
maybe those are some ways you can use it
but I don't think these are gonna be for
everyone there's just so many better
highlighters I wouldn't waste your money
on these ones they're just weird like if
it consists they're just so strange next
this is another thing I don't suggest to
anyone this is the true blend pre
touching palette this is a color
correcting palette which has the yellow
it has the green and it has the purple
and I just feel like
this is like way too late like people
really aren't too that into
color-correcting anymore I also wish
that this wasn't a pallet I find that
this is just not very consumer friendly
because most of the time you don't need
all of these maybe you need yellow
because you do have some discoloration
maybe you need red because you have some
redness maybe you need purple because
you want to brighten your skin tone but
most of time you don't need all of them
and so you're buying a product that has
so many other things in it I think it
would have been nicer if they made like
some really nice like pen concealers or
something that's like really easy to
apply and let's tap out with your finger
I've used the green one that's the only
one I've used and the consistency is
very thin so it doesn't look too green I
feel like you can definitely tame some
redness with it and I'm not saying I'm
gonna like get rid of it but I just
don't think this is for everyone I just
okay you know what I mean like it's just
not my favorite this is probably the
thing I hate the most I could only use
this twice because it just I can't I
can't do it this is the covergirl
peacock flare mascara I can't even get
this thing close to my freaking
eyelashes so let me give you a close-up
here we go here we go umm it is just
horrible I had never had eyelashes look
so ugly in my life I hate it I really
really hate this mascara it didn't have
any like flaking on me but I just can't
get to my lashes I like poke myself so
much I just I don't suggest this I know
mascara is very very personal though but
for me this is definitely I know nothing
I suggest please don't you just there
are so many other good ones on the
market
I I did not like this I'm not even gonna
use the waterproof one I have that
checked away to giveaway so yeah I don't
suggest that mascara at all and last
what I don't suggest I don't like these
I do not like the brow gel pomade thing
I tried a couple of different times to
use this I even use the brush I use
different brushes I love that it's all
in like one product this is a very tiny
container and I like that
the consistency on this is just so odd
it is almost like a weird silicone
primer like you can tell there's like a
lot of silicone in it and so it's like
hard to get really good pigman
it's just so weird I found that it just
didn't say it never sets either so I
never can like just know that it's gonna
stay in place I just I expected this to
be like more like an eyeliner
consistency and it's like just very
weird like I just rub that out with my
finger and it turned into like nothing
it's just strange it's a very strange
product I don't enjoy it I don't think
it works well so I don't suggest that I
only tried the blond one because again I
really tried hard not to like dig into
things if I didn't like it so I can pass
things on in a pristine state but yeah I
don't suggest that at all alright guys
so that is everything for this testing
testing one two three I know this is a
long video so if you make it to the end
