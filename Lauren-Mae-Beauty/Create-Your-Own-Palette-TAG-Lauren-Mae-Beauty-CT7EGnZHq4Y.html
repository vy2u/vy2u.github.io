Lauren I thought that I would do the
perfect palate tag I believe that's what
it's called
I saw cat from Kitsch snitch do this I
will leave her channel link down below
I've been watching her for a really
really long time I want to say she
created this tag pair saw her video and
I really wanted to do it so I'm going to
be picking 12 shades out of my
collection that I would choose to make
my own palette with this would be the
palette of my dreams or if I was
collaborating or had my own makeup line
this would be the palette at least at
this point in my life that I would put
out and love and hope that other people
with love it was really fun going
through my collection to really narrow
down the shadows that I wanted it was
hard because I only have 12 spots for
shadows and I'm trying to come up with
as many looks as I can that can go
together and are cohesive but are also
funky and totally me so these are my
picks let's just get straight into it
the first shadow that I would pick this
is generic but this is a matte cream
highlight shape I think that matte cream
highlights or nude depending on the skin
tone but definitely like the lighter
note even for darker skin is a must-have
in a palette I love to use these colors
to set my primer to highlight the brow
bone I do not like a shimmery brow bone
I think ever I just like the way a matte
eye looks and I like these colors
sometimes to where I just haven't really
like crease and then I'm matte cream
shade all over the lid so this is like a
number one super important if a palette
has this it's already like winning in my
eyes this would definitely have to be
included in my own palette I personally
like ones that are super pigmented and
that show up against my skin even though
I am fair I like ones that have that
pigmentation and pack-a-punch so you
don't have to use a lot of it I also if
I I'm just gonna say it I want this to
be like three times the size of any of
the other shadows in my palettes
oh I'm throwing that out there that's
also part of it for me I'm kind of going
from lightest to darkest or how I would
probably put them in a palette so the
next shade here is whimsical this is
from makeup geek it's a single shadow
and it's one of their foiled shadows
this is a really nice
light pink and I find that when you use
it on the lids or on the inner corner it
just gives a brightness to the eye it
doesn't necessarily look super pink or
anything I transit shadow over starry
eyed because I find on my eyes it's just
even brighter than that so for that
reason this would be in there I would
use this on the inner corner as a really
awesome highlight we're just all on the
lid for a really nice bright look this
is a beautiful shadow the next shadow
I'm picking should be no surprise to any
of you it is honest hacia beverly hills
orange soda
I have the tiniest amount of it left in
this but I haven't requested and it's so
difficult so I cannot get a swatch of it
I am probably going to get it on Tuesday
the Anasazi Beverly Hills store is
closed on Mondays whenever we go down to
Beverly Hills to see the plastic surgeon
for my husband's finger for right now
cuz he's injured it's closed Mondays and
all of our appointments are every week
on Monday but since Monday is going to
be the 4th of July our appointments on
Tuesday so it'll be open and I'm gonna
go in there and get my orange soda in a
single shadow so for the sake of this
because at the end I am gonna show you
guys my full palette swatch from my arm
I'm going to be swatching makeup geeks
Peach Smoothie but know that it would
actually be Anasazi Beverly Hills orange
soda the next shadow I'm picking for my
palette is the shadow sugar rush from
makeup geek this is one of the foiled
duochrome shadows at this point in time
these were like a limited release but
they are going to be getting the loose
pigment back in stock soon hopefully so
you guys know I love my duo crumbs and I
love color this is a white ish color
with a blue purple shift I like the way
this looks on the inner corner and again
for a nice light eye I think it's nice
something a little different and this
also does shift a little pink to it just
depends on the lighting it definitely
has like a three-shift
kind of thing going on it's absolutely
beautiful I love this I think it'll look
great too if you wanted to put like a
black base down or different colors you
can get a different look with this
shadow so I would include sugar rush for
sure in my palette v shadow in my
palette would be makeup geeks creme
brulee I'm sorry it's so much makeup
geek but I'm telling you I just love
them so much this I would use in the
crease this is not as warm as orange
soda and it's a little bit darker than
orange soda as well I like using
soda in the crease as a transition or
even a really like preciate and this is
just pea that one step darker and not as
warm I definitely think it has a place
in my palate it's just a great shadow I
think it's just a necessary shadow in
every palate oh this is definitely
making it into my palate the next shadow
I'm including in my palette is makeup
eeks chickadee now this is a warmer
shade and you'll notice that I did not
include desert sands in this only
because I don't have enough spaces to
have that many Browns so I figured if I
put creme brulee and this together or
another shadow that I have in here I
could kind of get a similar look to
desert sands this is that really warm
orange yellow type of shade that's what
it looked like I feel like you could
play this up Orange you could play this
up Brown you could play this up yellow
and I just think it's a really nice
shadow it's something definitely really
unique and I definitely wanted to
include it in my palette the next shadow
I would pick for my perfect palette that
I'm creating is the shade fireflies and
this is from stars makeup Haven I love
this lime green shade this is a shimmer
but I feel like it also kind of looks
matte so you could kind of get away with
either I love this on the inner corner I
think this would be so pretty to blend
things out you could use it in your
eyebrows for something funky I just
really like this kind of acid chartreuse
e green yellow combo and I really want
it for my palettes oh this would be
included in my palette the next shadow
for my palette would be Urban Decay's
tonic this is very similar to make a
Peaks black light but as you can see I
already have a dent going in the shadow
and this is like my first true love so I
chose to favor it this is such a
beautiful duochrome shadow it is a
purple with a blue shift and also a kind
of pink shift I just love this this also
would look so great over different faces
and I just could not put this in here I
love putting it all over the lid or up
and kind of into the brow bone and then
to the crease so beautiful I love this
shade it really shouldn't be a surprise
that's in here
the next shadow in my perfect palette
would be makeup geeks masquerade this is
another one of their foiled eyeshadows
and this one compared to Caitlyn roses
warmer and that is how I prefer my
shadows I personally don't like to go
too dark on the eyes so this with tonic
from Urban Decay looks so nice this is
like the darker shade you use to kind of
darken up that purple this is what I'm
wearing in one of my more previous
videos is this combo and I just I love
it it's so pretty
and even though again it's shimmery I
like to try to keep my crease matte but
I also am okay with doing a more like
editorial or all on guard look for like
everyday and so I feel like as long as
you're doing it with purpose and you
understand how shimmer and how matte
things and all these things work on the
different parts of your face I feel like
you can break the rules and still get
away with it because you're doing it
with purpose and it's kind of like that
saying you didn't know the rules to
break them successfully I added the last
part on my own I guess
anyway this would be the next shadow I
put in my palette another regular shadow
here on my channel is anastasia beverly
hills sienna this is such a pretty warm
darker brown at least on my skintone and
for me this is pretty dark this is kind
of as dark as i'll go in my crease and
to like darken up a look obviously i'm
pretty fair and so when i blend things
or whatever i don't like to go too dark
and and this is just perfect for me this
gives me enough contrast to make my look
really pop in my eyes to pop and give
them definition but it's not too dark i
just looked too smoked out or sometimes
I feel like when things look really
heavy it can date you anyway I would add
this to my palette I really like this
it's nice and warm but it still has a
depth to it I believe I only have two
shadows left for my 12 pan eyeshadow
palette the next one is coming from the
Urban Decay electric palette and I'm
picking the color savage this is a
bright hot pink it is a matte pink which
is amazing because you can use it in the
crease you can use this under the eyes
you can use this to blend out other
shadows and just add warmth I think this
would look so good with whimsical and
this kind of how this look is have
whimsical and then the pink on the
outside for a brighter look it's
something a little bit more edgy you
could also put this with the purples and
it just makes it a little bit warmer
adds a little bit of pink I also think
this would look great with creme brulee
and Sienna and again whimsical on the
lid and just add a little bit of spice
to something more neutral I just think
this is great plus of course I want to
put this
my brows so I don't think I could have a
palette without a pink in it and if
we're gonna go pink let's just go hot
pink in the last shadow that I'm adding
to my palette is makeup geeks cherry
cola I wanted something with a little
bit more depth in case I wanted to add
something as like liner or make
something even more smoky and of course
I would want my palate to be able to
work for all different skin tones so
someone might need something a little
bit darker to have that contrast on
their skin so this is my alternative to
a black I think it's really nice to have
a good black in your collection but for
my palette I don't want black in there I
chose to put this color because it's not
brown it has that little bit of like
that ready purple undertone so I feel
like it'd go well with the other shadows
that I picked but again it would still
give you that depth plus this alone
would be so nice all boy on the eye and
then smoked out with creme brulee or
even chickadee I think that would look
really awesome so that is cherry cola so
I'm gonna swatch all the colors on my
arms so we can see what my palette would
look like all together I think it'll
look really good I've actually I just
watched him of course when I was trying
to pick stuff out so I know it looks
good but let's see it
forgive my awkward swatching but these
are all the colors that I would pick for
my palette it definitely screams me it's
not gonna be for everyone because it's
not a neutral but I really think you
could get a lot of neutral looks out of
it and if I had to go right now and only
have these shadows in my collection I
feel like I'd be so happy with the
different looks I could create with
these different colors I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if this
is a palette you would buy down below in
the comments and what are some colors
maybe that you would definitely for sure
want in your palettes I will see you in
my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
