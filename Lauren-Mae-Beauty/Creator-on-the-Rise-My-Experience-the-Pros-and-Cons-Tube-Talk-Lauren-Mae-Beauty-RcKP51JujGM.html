Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing another tube
talk in my series of tube talk so I'm
gonna leave the playlist link down below
in these videos I like to cover
different topics usually dealing with
YouTube in the beauty community and
today we're gonna be talking about
creator on the rise now this is
something that I didn't really know
about until I was actually picked as one
of the creator on the rise for the week
so this isn't meant to be a braggy video
at all I really wanted to go over this
and look at this kind of scientifically
and talk about creator on the rise what
it is if you didn't know what my
experience was with it and kind of the
pros and cons because although this is
supposed to be a program I think that is
positive and I think it's really great
that YouTube wants to shout out smaller
creators there are a lot of cons that
come with it and I thought it would be
cool to share my experiences with you
guys I'm also going to be giving you
some like specific statistics in case
you're interested in that so that'll be
more so at the end of the video but
besides that let's just talk about what
is creator on the rise I am going to
leave the exact like description of what
YouTube's creator on the rise program is
but this is a program that anyone who
has a youtube channel and has over a
thousand subscribers is potentially able
to be picked from so you don't have to
put in an application or anything like
that they pick from the pool of creators
that have over a thousand subscribers
and a couple other factors that they set
on there they take into consideration
view count watch time growth and the
frequency of the uploads but from all of
that they randomly pick people who they
think are yeah creator on the rise or
they're having a good month or a good
stretch of subscribers and growth times
they're uploading frequently people who
have potential to be bigger channels in
the future now they don't only do this
with creators they also do this with
artists so you can either be an artist
on the rise or you can be a crater on
the rise and these people are featured
on the trending page either on the US
which I think artists on the rise are
only featured in the US and then creator
on the rise you can be featured in the
US or all these other places
I think depending on where you make
content and where you are located and
what your YouTube homepage is so if
you're like in the UK or Australia or
whatnot so anyway they pick you right
and you are featured on the trending
page for a total of 24 hours I'm gonna
leave a little screen shots throughout
while I'm talking showing you guys what
I looked like and like what it looks
like they have like a little blue button
on the training page that kind of
separates you from the other trending
video saying your Creator on the rise
and then you can kind of scroll through
and see quite a few of your videos and
it's like a kind of a weird mix it's not
like your most recent video but it's not
like old videos either it's very strange
so anyway that's what creator on the
rise is now on the 4th of January I'm
filming this and it is the 16th of
January so it's been a little like 12
days YouTube emailed me and I thought it
was spam at first I was like who and I
wonder if this is even real because
that's the type of person I am I I'm
like not clicking any of your links in
my email like I hope trust anyone I
thought this was a fake email from
YouTube but I'm going to find it and
read it out to you guys the title said
YouTube and then two colons lorem a
beauty we have something to tell you and
I was like that's really weird maybe one
of my videos got demonetised again or I
don't know maybe it was something else I
didn't know what it was and so I'm gonna
read you the email that they sent me it
doesn't say that I can't so I'm going to
it says hey Lorne may beauty we know
keeping a secret is hard but you'll need
to keep this under wraps for now think
you're up for the challenge okay here's
the super secret secret you've been
chosen as a crater on the rise woohoo
that means your channel will be featured
on the trending tab in parentheses the
united states within the next 24 hours
we have to keep this between us for now
but we'll send you an email as soon as
your channel is featured that's when you
can share this exciting news and check
out or videos on the trending tab you'll
probably get lots of new now here's the
part that makes me laugh it says you'll
probably get lots of new views and
comments hooray
to get ready check out our tools for
shaping the conversation on your
any questions they have a button you can
click to learn more about creator on the
rise and yeah that's what they send you
so there's no like do you want to be a
creator otherwise there's no like
question they're just telling you like
hey your video is gonna be up there for
24 hours now I personally think this
email is you know it's really cool to
find out but I think the reason that
they send this email is mostly because
they want to prepare you for all the
hate you're gonna get I mean it's
awesome because you get a lot of
exposure but I think that that probably
was the biggest thing I went and was
like searching other videos about
creator on the rise once I got this
email to like make sure it was a real
program YouTube even does again cuz I
wasn't sure this was like a real thing
and I'm gonna link one of the videos I
saw where someone were just getting like
all this hate it was like a whole thing
so I'm gonna leave that link down below
I think this might be something they've
added since starting creator on their
eyes because there have been issues in
the past and since you aren't like in
control of it being featured there yeah
it's kind of nice to at least get a
heads up and like either block a bunch
of words from your comments or have a
moderator for the 24 hours or whatnot
alright so that happened on the 4th of
January that I got that email and now on
the 5th I was like I don't know when
it's gonna go up is it gonna go up on
like the 5th at midnight and be up that
whole time but I think it went up about
the 5th of January like 6 or 7 a.m. and
they did not send me an email right away
telling me that it was up there they
actually sent me an email
it's really weird they sent me an email
finally confirming that I was up there
on the 8th of January so 3 days after
the fact that I had already been up
there which is really weird I don't know
what was up with the timing on that
because I obviously was checking the
trending page every you know now and
then to see if I was on there and I also
started seeing the traffic increase to
my channel and that was happening on the
5th so I don't know why I took so long
for them to email me out saying that I
was on there because by that time I was
no longer on the trending page because
it is only a 24 hour thing and so I
thought that was kind of strange I don't
know why they did that so I believe my
page got featured on a Friday and
kind of stayed up all the way into
Saturday morning I did definitely see an
increase in my views I guess I'll just
go into those statistics really fast so
right before I took a screen shot of my
subscribers just to like have it so
before creator on the rise I had thirty
one thousand three hundred and ninety
eight subscribers and then by the next
day basically toward the end of when I
wasn't featured any longer I went up to
thirty two thousand five hundred and
sixty-one subscribers so a pretty good
gain in subscribers I thought I would
also mention the main video that was
featured so it had my name and it had a
couple videos there was a specific one
that was like the first one and that's
the one that got the most traction that
was my best of 2017 video so it was
talking about all my favorite products
of 2017
and when I started I had thirteen
thousand five hundred and thirteen views
on that video I had 147 comments 827
thumbs ups and 46 thumbs downs and so
the day after I had 26,000 778 views on
the channel which is up 13,000 I
basically doubled my views on that I had
239 comments so that was up 92 comments
I had 928 thumbs ups so that's up 101
thumbs ups and then I had 265 thumbs
downs which is up 219 thumbs up from the
original video so from that data I can
tell that
obviously people saw that video they
clipped on that video and then did
whatever they were gonna do with that
video I got a hundred more thumbs downs
than I did thumbs ups which is something
to consider but we will go into the pros
and cons now I think so I'm gonna start
off with the pros because overall I do
think that creator on the rise is a
really awesome program I think it's
great that YouTube wants to find a way
to shout-out smaller creators now I
obviously am NOT a super small creator I
didn't have basically like a thousand or
two thousand views I had a good 30,000
views by that time and I think one of
the reasons I got chosen to be creator
on the rise was also because one of my
videos had done really well the month
before and from that video alone I had
basically doubled my subscribers so I
was just on
good pass already and I think that that
traction just I don't know whatever
helped with the watch time in the growth
and all those other factors that they
used to choose the creator on their eyes
I think that all really helped me but I
kind of think it's a good thing that
they're not choosing in necessarily
small channels now I did pay attention
to the creator on the rise who was after
me her channel was mixed-media girl and
I've actually really been enjoying her
channel so I think it is a really cool
potential way to get to know channels
and genres other than what maybe you're
used to watching I'm gonna leave her
channel link down below it's like an art
channel and she does acrylic pouring
it's super cool I've been super into it
so I think that's a positive where you
can find new creators and I think it's
cool that YouTube is trying to shout out
smaller creators because I think that is
sometimes a concern or an issue that a
lot of people have is that only the big
creators get on trending and you know
how it's so hard to grow what's starting
for something so small so I think it's
cool that they have this program to help
maybe fix that problem or at least make
some type of a difference they pick
three different creator on the rise
every single week in the u.s. so that'll
you know it's kind of a lot of people
for them to I think feature every single
week obviously there are pros like I got
a lot of subscribers now I was just
telling you guys about the subscribers
that I gained the day after but since
then since I'm filming this video right
now currently I'm at 43,000 480
subscribers so I've had a lot of growth
and that is absolutely amazing I mean
that's what you kind of want when you're
on YouTube you want people to find your
channel people that are going to enjoy
it and I think that that's a really
awesome thing I mean it's great it's
also really cool to be on the trending
page like it's something like like
almost like a youtube little check mark
you can cross off that's really awesome
it was really cool because I had some
people that like my friends they like
text me we're like oh my gosh we just
opened up YouTube and I see you on the
home page that's crazy
and so that was really awesome to get
that text and all that and on top of
that just another kind of like check
mark as you're being recognized by
YouTube has a creator it feels good for
YouTube to specifically pick you out and
say hey you're doing something good it's
like some positive reinforcement you
don't really get any of that with
YouTube like you get generic
but it's really cool to be you know
selected out of such a huge pool to be
featured that's an amazing
accomplishment I think that's an awesome
Pro obviously you know getting more
views and all that is a pro to like all
of the extra you know commotion going on
in your channel is a pro for the most
part so those are basically the pros
that I have and we're going to go into
the cons now because I feel like there
were a lot of cons and and I think
that's something very real to bring up
so cons first off I mean it's so much
hate you get so much hate I've heard
from so many big channels that when they
get featured on the trending page they
just get insane amounts of hate so it's
not just me it happens to everyone it's
like it's all your nightmares of like
the worst YouTube comments you'll get
and what scares you from having a
channel that's what happens when you go
to the trending page it just turns into
your nightmare I think it's great that
YouTube is sending out the email to
prepare you so you can go into your
comments and change things or again like
I said have a moderator who is gonna
look at those comments for you so you
don't have to read these nasty comments
but I basically got the worst comments
I've ever gotten in my youtube career
ever on that day and then once my video
was off of training I stopped getting
all of this comments so I mean it's a
hundred percent correlated to being on
the trending page don't get me wrong
I've had a few rude comments here and
there but it was nothing like the insane
amounts of comments that I got I did get
some really nice comments and people
being like oh I'm so glad I found your
channel found you through trending so
there were positive ones but the amount
of the negative ones and how intense
they were was quite was was a lot and I
personally I'm gonna go off on a tangent
about the hate comments right now I
guess so I mentally prepared myself for
these comments and with YouTube's help
that was great too to prepare myself and
I also was looking at creator on the
rise as kind of a science experiment
like I'm kind of trying to tell you guys
about now so to me I felt kind of
removed from it especially while it was
happening which helped but something
that I am so grateful for and this is a
pro to me which I know it sounds insane
to get all this hate wood
Pro butt creator on the rise and the
negative hate comments that I got
personally for me was such a
breakthrough in my mentality toward my
youtube channel I was always so scared
of like once my videos kind of not go
viral but go out of your normal
subscriber base once they do that you
just you have no control over them you
don't know how they're getting suggested
why that video is getting suggested and
you have no control over who's watching
them and who's commenting on them and
that's what happened with crater on the
rise I just had no control over it it
just happened and I think a lot of us
have fears of like well what if people
gonna say what are they gonna say
they're gonna be so rude whatever and
that happened right so all of that
happened and guess what I'm here I'm
still here don't get me wrong I feel
like I am more of a strong person when
it comes to this but it really just
solidified to me that like I don't give
a like that's such a great and
freeing feeling and it's not like well I
don't give a it's not like a
negative I don't give a it's just
like a like it's just so freeing I feel
so free from the comments section
whether someone likes my video gives it
a constructive criticism just flat-out
and sults me and tells me I'm really fat
and whatever I don't care like I love
the nice comments don't get me wrong but
I don't find validation in my comments
and it's free it's so freeing I just
don't have any of that hesitation
anymore and I am so excited for just
like everything to come because it
doesn't affect me and something that was
such a big fear of mine I feel like
that's something I was just like always
in this like back corner of my mind with
the lights off I now had the lights on
and could see that oh it's just a corner
of a basement there's no monster there
it's only a monster if you make it I
don't know I know this is not going to
be the same situation for everyone but
something for me is it really was such a
enlightening moment and I'm so happy
that it happened because I just have no
fear anymore with my content and what I
put out because I don't care I don't I'm
doing this for me I don't
you know I enjoy doing this and it's not
for anyone else another thing with the
hate comments is that a lot of these
children and they are children they're
just they're just immature little 13 or
all's like I don't know I just I didn't
take it personally and it was amazing so
anyway that's still a con though you
will get lots of hate just prepare for
it if you are sensitive or you don't
think you can handle it I definitely
suggest moderating your comments putting
in words that are blocked
whatever you think because we're just
not reading your comments that day like
just don't do it you know I know you're
gonna miss out on the nice ones but some
of the mean ones are really just crazy
hateful and some of them will like hang
out on your channel and then like go to
other videos and they want the attention
they just like they're they want someone
to fight with them so bad and I suggest
do not give in do not acknowledge if you
really hate them delete them whatever I
personally it's real life and that's
what happened so I don't delete them
unless they're being like absolutely
insane words like seven comments on a
video I'm like okay get your head
checked alright so let's move on to
other comments enough talking about hate
comments so about a day after being on
the trending page I got a message from
two people I've got a message from love
Heatherette telling me that Erin's
makeup euphoria I'm gonna leave both of
their channels link down below they were
letting me know that someone was
stealing my videos and I'm so
appreciative to Erin who originally
found it and for Heather to like making
sure that information got across to me
and so it really sucked I had to go
through they stole 30 of my videos I had
to go through and individually tell and
say that they were copywriting my entire
video I mean it was entirely everything
it wasn't using anything for fair use it
wasn't a criticism of me or anything
like that it was a hundred-percent my
entire video my thumbnail and my title
just copied onto someone else's channel
so I had to go through and do that
luckily I felt like YouTube did a great
job in the sense of they got back to me
within that night that I had reported
those videos they got back to me right
then and shut that channel down which is
great but it took a long time for me to
make sure I could actually you know
report every single one of those videos
so that sucked and it was just like a
waste of my time and definitely because
of my channel being on the featured page
and being on trending and people finding
my channel who never knew who I was
before then to me one of the biggest
cons is that I know it looks like my
subscribers are growing and they are I
have a lot of subscribers and I was
getting tons of subscribers afterward
that's the weirdest part so I've thought
that I would obviously get the most
subscribers on the day of creator on the
rise like the day I was featured that's
when I get the most subscribers and then
it would trickle down not true not true
at all I'm gonna leave a little graph
here of my subscribers and it's insane
I've had so many subscribers I was
getting like 15,000 subscribers a couple
days after fifteen thousand fifteen
hundred thirteen hundred seven hundred
fourteen hundred like crazy amounts and
they weren't correlating with my views I
was like I've never had that happen if
I'm getting a lot of subscribers and
it's because something's getting a lot
of views or I can tell in the comments
someone's left a comment saying someone
maybe shouted me out and that's why I'm
getting a lot of views or a lot of
subscribers but it wasn't making sense
to me nothing was making sense I wasn't
getting a lot of views so that means my
money wasn't also going up because you
need views to get any money but my
subscribers were school like
skyrocketing and I will say although my
views have gone up on each video quite a
bit I definitely wasn't seeing a lot of
like increased views on all the videos
that I upload which I upload almost
daily I happened basically this whole
year so far so um yeah I was just like
where are these coming from so that made
me check out my subscribers and I'm
gonna insert a clip in a little bit of
me showing you what this looks like but
I went through and was looking at my
subscribers and realizing that so many
of my subscribers that you know says 19
hours ago whoever subscribed to me if
you're a creator you probably know what
I'm talking about
and these it's like weird names like it
looks like weird spammy stuff and
obviously I didn't buy myself fake
subscribers or anything it's all because
of being featured on the trending page
so I'm thinking and
trying to like come up with Sam like why
is this happening like what is the play
here why are these people subscribing to
me that I don't feel like our real
subscribers it's super weird I don't
know why it's happening it's kind of
still continuing to happen I thought
it's definitely gone down I'm only
getting like about 500 subscribers where
I was getting like triple that closer to
when I was on the trending page but it's
definitely still happening and now it's
finally at the point where I'm losing a
lot of subscribers so I don't know I
just don't understand why that's
happening I don't understand the motive
behind it is it to like somehow scam me
is it to somehow get their name out
there is it just weird BOTS like I don't
know are they real people if there's no
way they're real people there is just no
way I don't know what's happening hi I
got oh my god geez I sound like a demon
mm okay so hi guys I wanted to show you
what this looks like for me so for
example this and this and this I don't
even know how to say that although that
could be real it also could be fake and
there's a lot of that type of stuff or
just like spammy
I don't understand what is going on it's
something that I keep bringing up just
Sam I'm like you know so like I'll look
at this and this is I mean a lot of what
I have obviously I have no control over
this you know this is something I've
just noticed since being on creator on
the rise and it definitely wasn't
happening like this before so whether
these people are real or whether it's
some type of weird scamming thing I'm
not sure but I just wanted to show you
guys just to give you an example it's
this type of stuff is what I'm talking
about
like I don't mmm what but I did finally
have a time where I am losing a lot of
subscribers so I got a notification from
YouTube it was so funny if you have the
YouTube creator studio app which I
suggest if you're a creator
sometimes when you look at your
analytics it'll leave you like a blue
notification being like hey it stuffs
increasing or hey whatever it'll just
kind of like let you know if there's
like a major change whether it's
positive or negative on your channel to
give you a heads up and it's a little
bit delayed so it'll be like yeah I
already know buddy you know or whatever
it is
um but it was so funny because I had
both it said you're getting so many new
subscribers you know between this time
this time you're up this money and then
right below it it was like your channels
lost a lot of subscribers at one time
what's going on and so I'm finally at
the point where a lot of this people are
unsubscribing from me in large chunks so
that also makes me know that there's
something weird going on I lost like 600
subscribers in one day and it's so funny
because I'm like I'll tell Sam and like
yeah I've lost 600 subscribers because
to me it's not exciting like I want to
grow don't get me wrong but I want to
grow with subscribers that enjoy my
content watch my content like my content
I don't care about that number being big
if it's not real and so that to me is a
con like it's not as exciting to grow so
fast and you know so fast and so
furiously when it's it looks like a lot
of it to me
is not real you know like I'm not
they're not watching my content that
they're not benefiting from my content
I'm not benefiting from them subscribing
to me and watching my content cuz
they're not because I don't even think
these people are real it dampens the
success of like gaining a ton of
subscribers because in my head I'm like
I want to slow down like if it's not
real I want to slow down you know I
don't want to get to 50,000 subscribers
and you know 10,000 of those people be
not real or something anyway I don't
know if other people have this this is
just like definitely my style of like so
that was just kind of a con to me and I
just think it's hilarious that I'm like
yes I lost another 300 subscribers Sam
like in a chunk I'll lose them all at
one time and that's how I know that like
something weird is up and I don't know
what's up with that like it's the
weirdest obviously I didn't choose this
I didn't choose any of the
this is just my findings after the
crater on the rise and what I've gone
through so overall I definitely think
crater on the rise is a positive thing I
definitely got more positive out of it
than negative I wouldn't take the
experience back I think it's really cool
but I definitely think there are some
negative things to it I think there
potentially could be a way for YouTube
to change it because I feel like a lot
of the hate comments that I did get
where from people who are more like
gamers and young children and um I want
to bring up a couple statistics really
fast because I think it plays into a lot
of the hate gender-wise on my channel
you can go in into your settings and
figure out like what your audience is
mostly made up of of men or females
males or females so I want to give you
three different numbers so from the 13th
of December to the 9th of January I had
an average of 93 percent female watchers
and 7 percent male Watchers which was up
quite a bit and was including when I was
on creator on the rise
now I shortened that to January the 3rd
through January the 9th which is
basically right at the time that I was
featured on creator on the rise and a
little bit afterward my percentage on
that was 77 point five percent female
Watchers and twenty two point five
percent male Watchers which is huge I
mean that's such a huge increase on my
channel of male viewers as opposed to
female viewers and over my lifetime of
my channel just to give you a better
idea of what's normal for me I'm ninety
five point seven percent female Watchers
and four point three percent male
Watchers so it's quite a big difference
and I think it's sad to me that my hate
increased as my male viewership
increased obviously not all men are like
that there are ton of males in beauty as
well so I'm not trying to like say
anything about that but I do think that
is a very relevant statistic and
something that I saw a huge increase of
and I think that potentially could be
something that YouTube thinks about
because as a creator on the rise that's
amazing but not everyone wants a beauty
channel so maybe only featuring me to
some people or maybe putting more of my
videos in they're recommended instead of
just on the home page because not
everyone wants it but then at the same
time it's like
that's just how it is like some people
react really negatively to seeing a
video in their trending page that they
don't want to see um and act immaturely
because they are immature because
they're you know 13 years old but yeah
that maybe there could be a solution to
it I don't have the answers to what that
solution would be but maybe some way
trying to protect the creator on the
rise from that onslaught of hate
although I just feel like sadly that's
kind of how YouTube is and in general
that's I think a solution we need to
find as a community because it's insane
and it definitely gave me insight into
what larger creators have to go through
and I definitely think that depending on
your mindset its it can be very damaging
to see all those comments on a daily
basis I cannot imagine especially if
they're pointing out things that you're
already and secure about or you know it
that just sucks so overall though it was
really cool I'm glad I got picked that's
really awesome and like a huge
accomplishment to me and but yeah that's
my thoughts I hope this helped at all
whether you are a creator and you were
just wondering about this weather or
just one of my subscribers and just want
to watch my video because it's me or if
you came here because you were searching
creator on their eyes and found this
video I hope it helps if you've already
dealt with it or if you haven't dealt
with it yet and you're like in the 24
hour before period um I hope this helped
in any way so those are my findings on
creator under eyes kind of weird a weird
little science experiment situation and
it's just weird
it's just weird so I feel like I can't
wait for my channel and was to go back
to normal and not have the aftershocks
of it like I feel like a big earthquake
happened and I'm waiting for the
aftershocks to go away so that I can
finally feel like my channel is mine
again
and that everything that's happening is
like more normal and not just like weird
or fake or questioning things you know
so okay that's it for this tube talk I
hope you guys enjoyed again the tube
