Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a update to my
current makeup wishlist I did one of
these videos back in September and it's
been a couple of months and now that
christmas is coming and the holidays
there's been a lot of new releases and I
wanted to come back and let you guys
know what are some new items that are on
my wish list things that I'm more
tempted to buy probably gonna buy if I
had extra money these are what I would
buy and I'm also gonna give you a bit of
an update on my last one I did end up
purchasing two items from that wish list
so the first one here is the dome alone
this is such a nice fragrance it's
English oak and red currant when I first
got it I was kind of nervous but it
smells really nice I do enjoy it I'm
really happy I picked it up and it's
great and then the other item I actually
have ended up picking up from that
wishlist is the nude Stix artist set
really happy with this it has a bunch of
different wololo it has a bunch of
different colors in it and I have really
been enjoying this if you want more
in-depth like reviews on these items I'm
gonna leave the hall link down below as
well as the haul in retrospect on it
linked down below so you can check those
out one last thing before we get into
these items if you want to figure out
why my makeup looks like this today um
definitely go check out my palette bingo
because yeah things got interesting I'm
wearing lashes like went down in
that video so yeah so if you want to
check out this look definitely check
that video out it'll also be linked
everything's always linked and I think
that's enough talking let's get into the
items that I am currently wanting /
probably gonna buy the first item on my
list and the thing that I'm probably the
most sure I'm going to purchase are the
Buddha obsession palettes these are
little mini palettes I talked about them
recently in a new Beauty launches but
they have 9 different shades and then
there are 4 different color selections
I'm pretty sure I'm going to pick up two
of them they retail for $27 and I just
think they're so beautiful I really
wanted to try some huda beauty stuff but
nothing has really sparked my interest
enough to get it I thought the original
rose gold palette as well as the desert
dusk were really pretty
but just the price on it it just was too
expensive for me so I'm so excited
actually decided to do these pallets and
offer her shadows and products at a more
reasonable price at least for me so I'm
definitely gonna try those out the other
item from hooter that I actually want to
try out too is the winter solstice
strobing lip gloss set this is on
sephora's website right now it retails
for $33 and this is limited edition I
think the shades themselves are also
limited edition but they're just
iridescent lip glosses I'm very much
into a very casual lip I love lip
glosses like that so I am excited to try
those out I love up their minis because
I don't need full-size products I don't
want to be twenty dollars for a
full-size lip product if I can help it
so I am excited to try this out and
again I will probably pick those ones up
and I'll probably do to some type of
like hooter video and tutorials and
whatnot so next let's talk about BH
Cosmetics I again recently talked about
this in the new Beauty launches but
they're coming out with the zodiac
palette and this is something that's
really piquing my interest I have been
wanting to try BH for a while now and
this palette might either want to do it
I don't know i really wanted to
spotlight highlighters too and I haven't
picked him up I don't know I just really
want to try this palette I think the
price is reasonable if you get it at the
very beginning I believe it $19.99 and
if not it'll retail for 2299 I think so
it's still very very affordable I think
that's something right now at least in
my life that I'm really into is like
affordable makeup I want to try new
things have fun but I just I don't want
to spend like $50 on something I don't
it's too much money I'd rather try out
other things that's just what I'm
gravitating at the moment is just like
less expensive options for makeup you
know but still good quality next I have
of course a few things from colour-pop
so I do want to try out the two newest
little twelve pan palettes that they
have the first one is you had me at
hello which is more of like a like pinky
purple red warm but still neutral
palette and it does have a mere in it so
it retails for $18 instead of the 16 and
then the other one is the element of
surprise and this is the palette that
I'm drawing
the most out of the two but I'll
probably pick up both if I make an order
I love that hot pink in there I just
think that the shadows in there just are
more interesting to me I know some of
the shadows in that palette are not
supposed to be used around the eyes and
I get people's concern for that and I'm
glad that they disclosed it I think they
could have done a little bit better job
of doing that but for me I still use
those products around my eyes
that's just like because they're not
like a proof to be around the eye area
so they can't like tell you to use it as
an eye shadow but if we all remember the
Urban Decay electric palette was
considered a pressed pigment palette
because a lot of those shades you can
use around the eye too and I still do so
anyway I just wanted to address that but
I want to get those two palettes just
kind of complete the collection which is
not the type of mentality that I like to
have but honestly I just love them I
think that everyone I've had I get a lot
of use out of I think they're just
beautiful they're like my go-to palettes
between all of them I can do so many
different looks I'm just like into those
freakin palettes I know I know I don't
need you guys to tell me two more things
from colour-pop that I want to try
though I really want to try the brow
boss brow gel it's just a clear brow gel
I've been really into more of a natural
brow ish I mean my brows aren't natural
if you guys see me without any makeup on
they are there's nothing there they're
just blonde Rekha house so I definitely
feel like I have to spend a lot of time
creating a brow I'm not lucky enough to
just be able to fill in a little powder
and have dark natural beautiful brows
it's just not it's not my life man but
I've been really liking a clear brow gel
to really give that like bushy eyebrow
look and I don't know I've just been
liking it and I heard Jake has to say
that it's kind of like soaked brows like
it gives you that same effect so I am
very keen on trying that product and
then the other product from colour-pop
is the concealer they're finally back in
stock they were out of stock for forever
but I really want to try it out it's
inexpensive
I feel like concealer is something that
I go through quite a bit and I'm always
on to the next one I feel like I've
mostly heard bad things about it but I
still want to try it just because it's
inexpensive like I know
my brain like it doesn't matter I want
to try it don't care what any of you
guys say imma try it
so those are the things from colour-pop
that I am thinking about picking up next
is a set from Sephora and it is the
Becca jet-set Glo prep and prime kit it
retails for $25 and it has three
different items in it it has two
different primers one is the backlight
primer and then the other one is the
first light primer
they each have point five ounces in them
which i think is pretty good cuz
together that's an ounce of product so I
don't know I think that's pretty good
and I want to try out primers from Becca
I feel like the only thing I've ever
really tried Rebecca are the
highlighters and honestly those are not
my favorite I have moonstone I had so
many I've decluttered a lot over the
years and so I would love to try some
other products from Becca see what else
they have to offer and I think this kit
is really awesome to do that and then
the other little item in this kit is a
many of the what's it called under eye
brightener I've heard ls talk about this
a lot she loves it I'd really like to
try it out and I love that it's a mini
because it's not too much product
I've been definitely getting back into
minis like I think they're a great way
to try out product sample products feel
like you're testing different things out
because I think that's something that a
lot of us really like to do is like oh I
want to try it I want to try this and
you can try minis and not be wasteful
because you can actually get through the
product you can see if it's something
that you actually like and you can use
it long enough to know if you want to
purchase that product and it's full size
and if you don't end up liking it you
know on to the next one it's not in your
collection too long there it's just
there's so many benefits so many
benefits I could go on and on but anyway
that set looks really great I think the
price is pretty good $25 so that is
definitely on my Sephora like love's
list I have quite a few more items I was
gonna be like oh I only have a couple
more but it's a little more than a
couple next is another kit this one is
from bareMinerals and it has six
different lip products in it you guys
know that I picked up a Gen nude lip
gloss earlier this year and I've really
liked it it's in the color sugar it's
great I've enjoyed it so much so this
has three lip glosses three of the
liquid matte lipsticks which are
something I've been wanting to try from
them I've heard from so many people that
this is like the most comfortable liquid
matte lipstick that
is I've heard it doesn't dry down which
is something I prefer so I've been
wanting to try it for a while
this kit retails for $24 which is an
amazing price I love that they're minis
one of the lip glosses is the color
sugar but I'm just gonna keep that and
not use it and put it in my kit since
it's a great nude color I think the
color selection is great like everything
about this kit is like my dreams so I do
want to try that kid out and again I
love it they're minis I do not go
through lip products very fast at all so
it's perfect for me to try and use
without wasting a ton of product and it
going bad eventually and the last thing
that you can actually get on like
Sephora site is the Chloe Morello and
sea otter London palette this is her
second collaboration with ciate London
and I haven't heard anyone really talk
about this palette but I don't know what
it is this reminds me of a lorac Pro
palette but I really like the color
selection it has some really pretty like
Reds and moths but then it has those
greens it just seems so wearable and
usable but interesting it also comes
with a couple other extras it comes with
a liner it comes with a mini mascara and
a mini lipstick I'm not sure if the
liner as many I kind of feel like it
isn't from the picture but it might be
anyway is there anything that special
about this I'm not sure they just look
like great shadows I just don't drawn to
it for whatever reason out of everything
on my list though this is probably the
thing I'm least likely to actually
purchase but I thought I would mention
it because it is something that's
definitely drawing my attention so next
is something that I've been wanting for
the longest time and I finally was
reminded of why I wanted it because it's
on ulties website I don't know what's
going on on my street today I feel like
I'm complaining about noise a lot lately
because it's crazy the next item on the
list is something that I was reminded
that I've wanted for a really long time
because they now are selling it online
at Ulta and it is the Milani setting
spray this when I came out was like on
everyone's YouTube channels everyone was
raving about it and I really wanted it
and I would always look forward at the
drugstore whenever I would go I feel
like I don't normally go into like CVS
or Walgreens or any of those places but
whenever I did I would check and see if
they had it and no one ever had
in store so this is definitely something
I've been wanting to drive her forever I
really still want to try it so that is
definitely on my wish list and the last
three things that are on my wish list
are from morphe which is really odd for
me I know but I don't know what it is
about these new palettes that they came
out with they are the 15 d-day slayer
palette and the 15 n-night master
palette they're inexpensive they're $15
they look like mac palettes like
I don't know what it is I'm just
definitely drawn into them color wise I
mean it's not like that amazing there
are neutrals but I just thought they
would be so nice I don't know I really
want them I'm so drawn to them guys if
that price got me though that's the
thing like I think they look really nice
I'm excited to try them so I might make
an order I don't know if these are on
ultis website I couldn't find the model
to his website but I did see them
obviously on the morphe site so that is
something I'm definitely interested in
and if I make that order not that I need
any more eyeshadows and this if I did
make an order like that it would be like
so eyeshadow heavy but Jacqueline Hale
palette guys like I think now that the
hype is died down now that it's not all
over the place and people aren't
freaking out and trying to like say it's
bad or say it's good get the views the
more I see this palette the more I want
this palette I know a lot of people are
continuing to use it because they it is
a good palette I think that it has a lot
of staple eyeshadows in it it's
something that you could use just every
single day create a lot of different
looks I don't know what it is guys I
don't know I also think that the new
packaging is something that's like oh
well that's also a plus like if I was to
get it now I could get it in better
packaging than it was when it first came
out which sucks for the people who
bought it originally but you know if you
didn't it is nice that they improved it
so anyway those are my wishlist items
let me know what has been kind of like
making me want to spend some money I
would love to know what items are on
your list and if any of this stuff is
yes or no
from you definitely let me know your
opinions down below so I can make
hopefully better and more informed
decisions on what's gonna be good and
I'm gonna be actually excited about
using so thank you so much for watching
guys and I will see you in my next video
