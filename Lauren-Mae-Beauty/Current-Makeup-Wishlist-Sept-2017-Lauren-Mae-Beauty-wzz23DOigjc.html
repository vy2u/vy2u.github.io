learned thank you so much for watching
today's video is going to be a wish list
these are some items that I've been
thinking about getting they've been on
kind of like a Sephora loves list or I
don't know I've just been thinking about
getting them these are not necessarily
new releases so that's why I thought
this would be different than doing like
my new Beauty launches because these are
items that are mostly older than I'm
just thinking about purchasing and I
thought it would be great to like carry
reisz's opinions if you have tried these
what you guys think about it kind of
like you would have like a friend and be
like hey should I get this what do you
think about it yeah so that's what this
video is so let's just get into it the
first item that I really want to pick up
are the dose of colors baked browns and
marvellous mob eyeshadow palettes I
believe these are 5 pan eyes shadow
palettes and they're monochromatic they
just look so beautiful I do have the
dose of colors ice cream palette and I
really like that palette I think it's
really well constructed I love that they
have a nice range of neutrals mattes
shimmers colorful colors like they just
did a great job with that palette and I
like the formula so I would love to try
out these ones I just every time I see
them I think wow these look so pretty
and even the baked Browns which I have a
ton of brown eyeshadows something about
it just looks so different I feel like I
would get just so much use out of that
palette I don't know it's calling my
name
both of those are so if you have tried
them and you like them let me know or if
you tried them and you don't I guess let
me know too but those are definitely on
the top of my list something that I'm
really wanting if you can't tell I love
eyes shadows those are like my biggest
weakness when it comes to makeup
I just love by shadows number two in
general Juvia splays I've really been
wanting to try out some palettes from
her as well I really want to pick up
this Herrin palette and see what it's
like it's a neutral palette that's warm
but it has some really fun pops of color
so that's one I've been looking at and
I've also been looking at the Zulu
palette this is a smaller palette I
believe it has nine shades in it but has
a ton of really beautiful colorful
shadows and I think it just looks so
beautiful and so since I haven't tried
anything from dubious place those are
the things I really want to try the most
from the brand they just look really
really beautiful next are some perfume
these are from the brand pin rose
perfumes they just look really beautiful
the bottles online are just shaped
really pretty I don't want to just buy a
straight up bottle and thinking about
maybe buying one of these like sampler
packs or something just to kind of smell
them and see I have used up so many
perfumes this year so I am like getting
down to some that I don't have that many
left and I'm really wanting to be super
picky about what I bring in so I
definitely want to like smell some of
these they're just something about the
brand is intriguing me and I really
would like to try some of them they have
like a mini rollerball set that's coming
out for holiday that looks really cool
it's kind of pricey I probably won't buy
it but I kind of want it I'm gonna read
you some of the descriptions of the
scents just so you can kind of like
maybe understand where I'm coming from I
think one of their best selling ones is
called Sun synced and it's described as
bask in the glow of this breezy ocean
and coconut blend you say the words
coconut and I'm their baby I love
coconut scents they're one of my
favorites and it says perfect for Sun
kissing and skinny-dipping sent notes
eucalyptus lime mandarin yuzu I love
yuzu mid-notes sea salt Kashmir violet
and then base is coconut wood and
sandalwood like doesn't that sound so
good I really really want to try that
one out garden gangster they have one
called garden gangster the top notes are
lime Italian bergamot and Mandarin the
mid notes are freesia and apple blossom
the base notes white musk and cedar wood
this sounds like scent I would super
love as well so they just have some
really cool perfume something a little
bit different than I feel like you know
celebrity fragrances are things similar
to that I feel like I gravitate more to
boutique fragrances so this brand seems
really cool and I would love to try
something from them or get some samples
and then go from there and pick the
scent that really fits me hopefully one
does next is another perfume brand I
think that I'm really just wanting to
get some nice perfumes just to give you
like a scent profile on myself I really
love eccentric molecule that's like one
of my all-time favorite scents ever oh
it's so good I used up a whole bottle of
it and I'm so sad
I like Bulgari omnia coral that one
smells really good like Marc Jacobs
Daisy
there one time I've used up that I
really really love they also like fig
and coconut sense and more like unisex
sense so just to give you an idea anyway
so for more perfumes I want to pick up
Jo Malone I really want to try the
English oak and red currant I really
like the smell of current I have had a
Jo Malone fragrance in the past when me
and Sam went to France I picked up the
Jo Malone blackberry and Bay which I
would love to repurchase that is one of
my all-time favorite scents as well it
smells so good it's like I can't even
describe it it just smells so good to
like go to Nordstrom or wherever they
sell jo Malone and try it because it
smells delicious so I would love to pick
that one up again the only thing is
these are really pricey so for me I
would definitely need to save up money
to get these items because I don't want
to just purchase the small one
especially in a fragrance I know I love
like the blackberry in bay like I know I
love that scent so I'm not gonna waste
my money and get the small and I'm just
gonna go for the big one
so yeah that's like $135 but you know
it's my wishlist it's not it's not into
fruition yeah it's BA I definitely want
to purchase that fragrance in the future
again because I already had ones next
let's talk about new sticks nude sticks
came out with a nudist it's like a nude
artist set and it's in collaboration
with a bunch of different influencers
one of them is Samantha Ravan doll from
like battle ash also Jonathan I don't
glib Gib Donovan Gibb I think that's a
saying I'll leave the channels link down
below but those of you like - I believe
I know that we're in collaboration but
the colors are just so pretty I saw LLS
do a swatch video I will leave that link
down below as well anything I talk about
is always linked to down below just hey
guys you know if you ever are worried
check it out down below anyway she did a
really awesome swatch video of them and
they just look so pretty I'm not someone
that's super in to lip products but my
favorite type of lip products are pencil
forms
I have tried nude sticks in the past and
I really liked them as a brand I like
their message I like like how simple
their products are but they work really
well and again they're in that
stick form instead of like a traditional
lipstick bullet so I am really really
wanting to pick this set up I think
there's a nice range of nudes I think
it'll be great for Falls so that one
will probably be in my collection sooner
rather than later I have two more items
on the list the next one is from first
aid beauty and it is their coconut
smoothie primer I did use up a sample
size to this item and I really really
liked it and I miss it and going into
winter I feel like my skin is just going
to get even more dry I am oily but for
whatever reason lately I feel like my
skin has been changing a bit and I do
like the look of more just moisturize
dewy skin even being oily so I really
like the way that looked on the skin I
like the way it performed so that is
something I am definitely looking into
buying if you have any suggestions for a
really nice moisturizing primer I would
love to know them I went through one
sephora's website and was just like
looking at moisturizing primers and
things I thought that might work for me
and just kind of saved them off to the
side so I could go through and like look
up reviews and you know kind of like
figure out which one I thought would
really work the best for me but since
I've tried that one I know that it's
gonna work well and I do really like it
so I probably will be picking that up
and then last something that has been on
my mind for a long time is the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder this
is most people's all-time favorite
powder ever and since I am into loose
powders and translucent powders I really
want to see how this one works if it
really is different than so many of the
other loose powders out there I love
just like a lighter look on the skin so
if this can give me that even better I
will be so excited so I really want to
try that out and that's everything guys
let me know if you've tried any of these
items what your guys's reviews are down
below I love reading through your guys's
comments and just kind of yeah forming
my opinion maybe you'll swag me one way
or the other also let me know what some
of the things are on your wish list or
if there's something you think that I
should kind of like maybe look at I
don't know I would love to know thank
you so much for watching guys and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
