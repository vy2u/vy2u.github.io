tour of my setup so I have these two
bags here and they are all just like
extra stuff because we're going into the
night time so it has like a ton of
different like blankets and Poncho's and
things to keep me warm plus potentially
keep actors or whoever else doesn't have
some thing just kind of being extra
thoughtful there then I have my set bag
which I showed you guys yesterday and
that's kind of what I've been working
out of underneath that is like where I
keep all my hair stuff probably won't
use much from it but just in case we're
kind of like far away from our cars I
can't get back to the car and I thought
I would bring it plus it's a nice little
stand for things this one is more like
special-effects type of stuff there's
bugs all over the place
and then this is my chair and I have it
set up right now so I have my brushes
these are face and eye sanitizer this
kind of fell over I have two pallets for
face stuff this is that makeup bag I
showed you guys yesterday with all of my
stuff I don't know why it's going in and
out of focus and then I have a little
trash bag here and the biggest thing I
wanna show guys was all this stuff this
has like all my stuff for the witch in
it these are like the main products I'm
going to be using so these are face
paints from Wolfe and then I also have
this Ben Nye color cake makeup I have
this for like the face painting it's
gonna be kind of like pagan looking with
white marks on her face so I thought
these would be nice this one I wanted
cuz it's a little bit more powdery and I
thought that might be a nice effect I
also have been nice snow white which I'm
gonna put in the brows but you could use
any of those too for that I'm doing kind
of a bit of a blush heavy look so I'm
going to use these silence potentially
this gold wire I'm gonna kind of dread
up a couple of pieces of hair and kind
of wrap hair around it I was looking on
Pinterest and had some really good
inspiration pictures so I thought that
would be kind of a cool little touch I
just kind of pre-made some pieces but
we'll see once she gets here what will
work but that'll be kind of a cool
effect also throughout this thing if you
see my nasty hands
they are mostly dirty from yesterday
still the products use just like get in
the crevices which is what they're
supposed to do and sometimes they're a
little bit difficult to remove if you're
not like trying to so it's just dirt
from yesterday like fake dirt not
Hildur
hey guys I thought I would check in my
phone is probably gonna die so I'm gonna
save it for the rest of the witch stuff
hopefully I get some good shots that is
the house though behind us where we
filmed the first part super cool stuff
there's like an axe and he's like
chopping stuff up also I'm in new head
carved I feel like this is just like a
hat fashion show that's what this blog
is but I'm not using these because it's
cold not yet at least
it's because of all those dang bugs and
it's stopping them from going into my
ears which is awesome so anyway I'm
crashed down in that's right now and I
hope you guys are enjoying this it's a
really really cool location once again
and then tonight it's gonna be awesome
there's this really cool altar art has
done an amazing job doing this like sick
altar and there's fruit it just looks so
cool so I'm really excited for tonight's
shoot to see what we get
so we just went to the bathroom because
there is no bathroom on location this is
Molly she's costume and it was
definitely interesting it's taken like a
good one on like 40 by the bathroom so
we're headed to location with food then
we should hopefully she
I was actually going to start editing my
video and realized I never updated you
after last night so I thought I would
just kind of wrap it up here I have no
makeup on it's Wednesday and I'll
hopefully get this video up today don't
mind my light and I make a bag in the
background I have a lot of cleaning up
to do today but we wrapped last night at
like 12:00 something and then I still
had a quite a long car ride home so I
think I got home around 2:00 or so in
the morning so it was a really long
night and we had the fire and the witch
and that was such a cool shoot it looked
really awesome I'm excited to see the
footage I don't know why because I was I
did get sick at the beginning of this
month but I was feeling better and when
I woke up today I just wasn't feeling
that good I have like a stuffy nose and
my throat's hurting a little bit which
is so irritating cuz I just got sick and
I thought it was better I don't know if
it was the fire maybe though and just
like the long night so I'm hoping that
this isn't anything bigger than
something I can just get over today I
woke up so so late today but I just kind
of enjoyed sleeping in and tried to kind
of recover a little bit I hope you guys
enjoyed this video as much as you did

lovely comments on there I missed you

to filming if you have specific ideas of
what you want to see let me know I have
some videos that I did film before but I
