that's Lauren thank you so much for
watching this video is going to be the
strength you might potentially need to
not buy stuff for Black Friday I thought
it would maybe be fun kind of helpful
for you guys helpful for me to come on
here and kind of talk about the reasons
why we don't need to get sucked into the
hype things you might want to consider
before you purchase things for Black
Friday just so you don't buy like
everything or buy too much or just kind
of go too crazy because of all these
suppose it deals and yeah so I just have
a few points I wanted to make maybe
consider these things if you're feeling
like you need to buy stuff come back to
this video yeah I don't know it's just
kind of I wanted to go the opposite way
I feel like then most of the videos
they're gonna come out telling you about
awesome deals which you can sometimes
not have a good deal on Black Friday but
um I think it's also important you know
with my channel I try to I try to talk
both sides you know so if you want to
hear some of my tips or some things that
maybe you should consider before buying
things let's just get into it I think
first off it just needs to be said like
you don't need any of this any of it
anything you're considering buying on
Black Friday anything in any of the ads
like you don't need any of it at all at
all like what Black Friday is such a how
did this even happen I should have done
some research into like the history of
Black Friday I'm like why it is the
shopping day that it's become but yeah I
think first off it's like you don't need
any of it no matter what you're like
brain is telling you no matter all the
feelings of desire and want that you
have those feelings of just like anxiety
like oh I hope I get this before it
sells out or you know I gotta get this
you don't need any of it at all you will
be a hundred percent fine you were fine
without it before you'll be fine without
it after let it pass over like away from
the ocean breathe you know but you don't
need any of it so other than that you
know we all know we don't need any of
this stuff but I think something to
consider before you go looking at
catalogue is making sure that you're not
gonna buy things just because they're on
sale just because something is $10 off
or 20% off or 30% off doesn't mean you
need it any more than before and I think
you know not let
marketing strategies get to you big you
know signs with percentage off or buy
one get one free or whatever not letting
those suck you into things that you
didn't even want in the first place and
making sure you're spending your money
and hopefully less money than you would
have before on things you actually were
in the market for already things that
you're missing in if we're talking about
makeup things you're missing in your
collection that you wanted to get um if
we're talking about clothes or you know
your household things that you already
kind of needed in a way or we're already
gonna purchase but now you're just
getting them on a better deal instead of
being like well I didn't think I needed
rugs well now I'm gonna get seven
because they're ten cents each which
nothing is that cheap let's get that
straight to instead of getting sucked
into you know getting all these weird
pots and pans you don't need or whatever
else there is you don't need that stuff
really try to stick to the things that
you were already gonna purchase things
that were already on your wish list and
maybe you can get a good deal on them
now that they're in the sale next I
think it's important that you do your
research I think the best way to go into
Black Friday if you want to go Black
Friday shopping if you think that you
can get some good deals is to do your
research know what stores are selling
what products at what price you can get
the best deal on them I think there
might be some misconceptions that maybe
Walmart has the best deals or Target
does and they might have the best deal
on one thing but they might not have the
best deal on something else so if you're
gonna do this and you actually are gonna
like try to save some money I do think
that doing your research is gonna help
you win as a consumer and a customer
instead of letting again the marketing
and the stores kind of like take over
your mentality once you're in the frenzy
that is Black Friday shopping that being
said I want to point out too that Black
Friday deals are not always better than
the regular deals I used to work at
justice just for girls I worked there
for five years I was a store manager for
a good period of time I worked my way up
so yeah I can tell you right now our
Black Friday deal was 40% off and all
the other times we had sales were 40%
off we had 40% off that was our sale
like that's what we did I don't know if
that's changed now but
I know for us we were always just like
why do people come shopping here like
this is literally the same deal that you
could get on a random you know weekend
that we're having this same sale so
again with research you should kind of
maybe know what our normal deals if
you're going to Bath and Body Works and
the camels or buy-one-get-one-free
that might not be that good of a deal
you know what I mean like you know that
you can get that at some other later
point in time so don't feel pressured to
buy stuff that day if it's not even that
much better than what you could be
getting before why waste time in the
crowds why deal with all the stress and
the people and all of that and you know
buying everything at one time when you
don't have to when you can get these
deals
I'm sure leading up to Christmas so
definitely make sure you do your
research and you know that these sales
are things that you never ever ever ever
ever seen and that they're not just like
tricking you you know another thing I
think it's important to do is to
eliminate the frenzy so eliminating this
kind of just like mindless wanting of
buying and oh it's crazy
oh yeah just don't run the cart let's go
I hope this video was part of that
eliminating the frenzy kind of cutting
through some of the bull crap and you
know just kind of like bringing your
level from here to like okay
I see what's going on you know because
the more people talk about stuff the
more you look at the ads the more you're
talking with your friend about it the
more you're at the store and people are
acting crazy it's midnight it's 2:00 in
the morning or whatever it is I think
trying to eliminate as much of the
frenzy as possible it's going to help
you make better buying decisions you're
not gonna make impulse purchases yeah I
definitely think trying to have as level
of a mind as possible again I think the
points I mentioned earlier like doing
your research as well as like getting
things that are already kind of on your
list are gonna help eliminate that
frenzy but I think it's something to be
said because there's something about you
know everyone buying this mob mentality
and the frenzy of the deals and it being
a weird time of day like everything
about it just like weird you know I
think you can make some weird decisions
the next thing I want to talk about is
like examining your coupons I know a lot
of brands send out coupons to like go
shopping with and
again making sure that those coupons are
actually worth it I just got some bath
and Bodyworks stuff and it was saying
like spend 30 get $10 off which is I
mean I don't think it's that good of a
coupon for them it's not like bad it's
pretty good but it's not that amazing
and you can get that I can use that
coupon from like the 20th of November
into December why would I go on the
busiest night to go shopping why would I
do that why would I go at a weird time
to go shopping so I think just making
sure your coupons like seeing if you can
spend them a different time you know are
they actually a good deal once again do
your research on that but don't let the
coupon suck you in like just because it
says $10 off like make sure you read
through it actually gonna apply to the
things that you're wanting is it apply
to makeup or is it only for house goods
or is it only for clothing is it only
for jewelry when it comes to some of
those like Macy's coupons sometimes that
is an issue so I think just like reading
the coupon and making sure that you're
getting the best deal and that it's
actually good another thing if you're
gonna end up buying stuff honestly I
really think you should only be buying
things if you're getting a deal left
like forty to fifty percent off or more
if you're getting 20% off you're getting
30% off again there's no reason to buy
things that you wouldn't already use you
don't need you don't need any of this
stuff you know I think constantly
keeping in the back of your mind that
obviously they are trying to get your
money like they're doing whatever it
takes to get your money and hopefully
you can get a good deal out of that but
you're not going to be getting a good
deal if you end up spending a hundred
dollars on a bunch of makeup but if you
there wasn't a sale you would have only
bought one of those items and spent
twenty-five dollars at full price so
keep that in mind just because there's
some type of discount doesn't mean it's
that good of a deal doesn't mean that
it's worth the value of it doesn't mean
that you should buy 700 of them or ten
of them because of that so personally if
you really want to try to get the best
of the best deals
I would pick up stuff that honestly is
at an insane discount I know last year
honest hacia had their single eyeshadows
for like an insane price like if I like
for me one of the markers and if
something's good is if I can get that
item at a better deal than I can at a
store where I get
discount if I can get something for 50%
off like Smashbox whatever and I'd
actually use it actually I've been
wanting to use it for 50% off
I can only get 40% off at the pro store
so that is a great deal like I can't
just get that any time so to me that
would be something to potentially
consider but I definitely think you
should be focusing on the deepest
discounts instead of things that are
just like a measly fifteen percent or
ten percent or twenty percent
I mean Sephora sale just happen and it's
20 percent and I talked about how that's
not that big of a deal so I definitely
think you should stick away from lower
percentage off things and go for the
best best best deals and of money off
and the last I just want to bring up
like you know Black Friday shopping is
fun and all cyber monday is now like a
huge thing and it's like this whole
weekend thing but you know you can
always just spend time with your family
turn off social media turn off your
Instagram stop watching the YouTube
videos and just enjoy the time with your
family enjoy the holiday weather that
means you know you're sitting on your
porch drinking a hot cocoa or whatever
it is like you can do other things
besides buying makeup that are gonna
feel gratifying and gonna feel great
you're gonna make awesome memories
things you'll remember for life I think
focusing on some of those things things
that aren't just like tangible goods and
that can make you happy is a great way
to kind of hopefully put into
perspective that you don't need
everything make you feel better about
not buying things at least until the
storm is over and I think that's
something too it's like this is just a
frenzy it will pass same with the
Sephora vib sale I didn't buy anything
during the sale I didn't buy one thing
during the sale you know and I feel fine
I'm fine okay do you know I think just
like letting it go letting it pass once
it does pass you'll feel happy that you
don't have a bunch of stuff that you're
not gonna use if you miss everything
obviously you can always keep in mind
like different project panning
mentalities and things like that but I
hope this helped at all I don't know I
just wanted to kind of talk about this I
had mentioned in a comment to someone
and I was like I think I might do that
she's like yeah do it so hopefully it's
like maybe at least had you like stop
and like doublethink some
maybe you only got like five items on
your list instead of the 15 or ten that
were on it I think that's everything
I'll stop talking thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
