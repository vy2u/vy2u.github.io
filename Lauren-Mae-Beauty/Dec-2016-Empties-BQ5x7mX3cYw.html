going this is going to be an empties
video now I just got through editing my
other empties video so this is not too
far behind it in the sense of uploading
but I am Telling You that time has the
house between these two so this is some
more stuff I use death I want to clean
this out so I can have like a fresh new
drawer for the beginning of the year I
was doing these monthly but then I kind
of got off-track and like now I don't
know I don't know i'm just going to do
them when i want to maybe kind of
monthly and just title them kind of
monthly I don't know closest we'll start
off with my makeup empties the first
thing I have here is the mac fix+ now
i'm not a huge math girl i really have
only tried a few things but i really do
like the mac fix+ one thing i didn't
like is it got to the end the spray was
not as good as like from the beginning
so just kind of suck that you're already
obsess it's almost gone and then it
doesn't perform the same as when it's a
full product but other than that I do
you think it's a great product I used it
to foil I shadows I used to just kind of
get rid of a powdery finish in general
it just feels nice as a face refresher
and smells super good i also have a
Maybelline fit me you guys now I love to
Maybelline fit me just wanted any color
fair and that's my favorite shade to use
i highly suggest this concealer is one
of the best for the drugstore i would
have to say this is my favorite one from
maybelline they do a lot of concealers i
know they just came out with a new one
too but this one's so good i love it and
the last make up empty this is the real
selves all you my zhing mascara i really
like this stuff let me see if i can show
you the one else is the wand looks like
it's very big and just like a natural
bristle supposed to give you volume and
i do find that a gaming volume but if
you get rid of too much length either
and never made my lashes clumpy there's
just something about the realest still
not years that i really like they are
super expensive different skin care
company so they're supposed to be better
for your eyes they just perform on my
lashes and i do think that my lashes
grow better when i wear this which is
supposed to be a claim of this mascara
as well so i highly suggest this i also
suggest the lengthening one that's
probably my favorite one out of both of
them but they're both good and I do
really like them
and those are going to be my first
makeup empties for 2017 I'm so excited
although I kind of like gave you guys
more of like a view of what's going on
let me know if you like that let's get
into the rest of the stuff there's quite
a bit of stuff so with our move next
this is the bath and body works
honeycrisp apple and buttered rum
orchard body wash this not really nice I
really like appleton so and I'll ice
bath and bodyworks shower gels I think
they're great i have a ninety-one
percent alcohol here I told you guys
like a million times what I use this in
my kit the reason I in ninety-one
percent is because I have alcohol
activated palettes that you need a
minimum of ninety-one percent to
activate 99 is best just because it's
faster so this not only sanitizes in all
other ways but that I can use it with my
palate too and it's easier to get your
hands on 91 2 99 so I love this this is
like an essential for my kit another
body wash this is the delicious sugar
tea air flower absolutely love these and
body washes this is a really thin like
oil consistency you need very anything
and it sets up in your loofah I don't
particularly love this end it's not that
it's bad it's like grape meets something
else I can't put my finger on it it's
not really like anything else I've ever
smelled before I really love this brand
though in general I think they put out
really great quality products I think
these are great for gifts or if you want
to treat yourself or treat someone to
something I'd love delicious I really do
and Sam really like this as well so i
would highly suggest this and i would
love to have a couple more there disa
spensive a couple other kit items these
are hand sanitizers and you know the
assured hand sanitizer I get these at
the dollar store this is my favorite one
there's another one that I've done and I
hate it it's like leaves and a low just
to moisturizing of a feel and I'm just
constantly using this between clients
and just different things so I just like
it to be don't leave a residue and these
are perfect so yeah I really like the
hands of
there I have a candle this month this is
the bath and body works autumn candle
now this is one of my favorite sense
ever from Bath and Body Works this just
brings back so many memories this
reminds me of when I looked at home with
my mom and I was in to youtube and bath
and body works and I had all these
candles and I burned this in my room and
I thought it was so cool it's just so
funny when I look at home so I really
love this said I have a lot of memories
tied to it but for whatever reason I
don't know if it's because this candle
was old because i have a lot about the
bioware candles to go through and I
don't go through them nearly as fast as
I used to it just didn't smell the same
as it burned I don't know if my scent
palettes changing and that it just
didn't smell nearly as good as I
remember it smelling so i might get
another one of these in the current year
that it comes out and sees that part of
the reason but other than that i might
be changing my scent or maybe it's
something to do with the candle being
burned and if it was like in a hand wash
or something i would like it i know i
was like tennis at that I didn't love it
as much as I used to but he's dry
shampoo you guys know I love it another
bus and bodywork cider I swear I don't
know why there's so much stuff in body
works in here this is the crisp morning
air and I love their hand soap they are
my favorite hand so I feel like you
definitely get what you pay for the
quality is really nice they smell really
good the last a while I just like the
texture of them too so this one's melt
really nice and clean i believe it was
part of like the fall one I just get
whatever comes out and I also stock up
to so I was telescope I don't need
anything for a while I feel like
packaging things these are the face
secrets small ultra witches and i use
these in my kit i guess these at sally's
i'm not sure if there's like the best
price for them but I know I license
spongers so I just go back to them
because I know them and then these are
the cleansing pads just cotton rounds
from big lots and they're a dollar
twenty i think for 100 they're ok
they're not the best i'm not going to
talk about cotton round but you
over the whole thing I see pack of wipes
I get these at big lots also you guys
know these are my favorite I have the
cucumber ones here this is not my
favorite sent out of the three have
tried this is the one I suggest the
least I just think the sense a little
overwhelming and it's a little fake
sweet the green tea I really do like I'm
kind of used to this now because when I
went for a couple times now they haven't
had the aloe so if they don't have a low
I suggest green cheese I thought this
was empty but it's not so i'm glad i can
use a little bit more but this is the
Berman industries brush cleaner i get
this at mimi's here in California so I
thought this was the one I had
originally which is purple but as you
can tell this one's pink and this smell
big citrus the other one smells like
vanilla just like the cinema secrets I
definitely like that one better out of
the two versions for whatever is in
russellton cut it at the end it wasn't
cleaning my brushes as well I have the
purple one now and not one seems to be
working better I might go back to cinema
secrets though there's just some things
like lip products that are like wax
based and yeah cream products and stuff
sometimes you just like cannot get the
color out like even if the brush is
clean i still like color i find that
hidden secrets really does combat and
get all the staining out too so anyway
I'm just kind of testing things out
figuring out what I like it's I feel
like someone's like hair products and I
was like it worked at first but now it
doesn't that's why I feel like these
brush cleaner driver mean I don't know
what's going on I have a skincare
product here this is these nail jelly
mask and this is a sheet mask from scad
erm I get a whole review on scooter and
products all these it linked down below
if you're interested I didn't really
like this mask I felt like less than two
dollars this is a really nice mask it's
one of those jelly ones it fixed the
space ok I found it kind of was a little
scrunched for me although I will say I'm
not an expert at these types of masks
only because I don't like the feeling of
wearing the cloth mask I just get
claustrophobic it just gives me a little
bit of anxiety and it's just not
relaxing for me but if you do like these
types of masks I thought this is good so
I felt really like refreshed more than
anything it is felt refreshed after
wearing this this small little thing is
the embryo least moisturizer the cream
concentrate I have this in my kit now i
bought the big side i really like this
as a moisturizer I don't use it on
myself personally just because it's more
expensive it's not super simple but it's
not like drug store either it works
really nicely on all skin types we feel
like all ages it's just a really nice
overall moisturizer I have another one
of these olay serums we get these at
costco and you get a 3.4 ounce for the
price of the 1.7 ounce bottle to this is
thirty dollars me and Sam do you really
like it I enjoy it I can definitely see
myself buying it again in the future but
if you want to try this kid arm serum so
I'm saying I'm going to order that next
on amazon and i think that's less than
thirty dollars anyway so price-wise is
pretty comparable is not less so that's
where i'm going to go but i do really
like it I definitely suggest getting it
at costco though getting it for a better
deal I have a little sample here this is
the lemon water sleeping mask I really
like this if you need hydration this is
a really nice product I would use this
kind of as like an overnight moisturizer
and not just as like a mask and then
wash it off i'll just leave it on all
night and then in the morning wash my
face it feels so good i really like I
feel like that in the belief products
are really similar to me like they just
have this really nice moisturizing
feeling to them without feeling heavy I
don't know how they do it I just really
like the products that tried from them I
think this is a lot md this is a loofah
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it has this for
quite a while yeah I'm gonna let this go
I got another one from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
these are my favorite loofahs although i
did just go to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and get
two new ones one for me one for Sam and
their way tighter than the see how this
is like fluffy and i know i've used this
for a long time like this is like
ripping off but they're very like stiffs
I doubt they've changed like who makes
it looses or something but they used to
be my favorite we'll see if that rings
true still I feel like it was a little
all over the place in this empties but
hopefully you guys enjoyed it
I think that's everything I hope you're
having a wonderful day and I will see
you in my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
