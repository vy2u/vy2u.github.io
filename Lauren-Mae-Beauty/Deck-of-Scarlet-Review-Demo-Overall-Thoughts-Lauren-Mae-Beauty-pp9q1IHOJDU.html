Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a deck of
scarlet review I asked you guys gonna
get ready with me if you wanted me to do
a review on deck of scarlet because they
did contact me and I wasn't sure if I
really wanted to do it so I thought if
you will want me to then I'll do it and
I'm not gonna lie it was about like half
and half on that video some people were
like no don't do it other people are
like yeah do it so I did end up doing it
obviously since this video is happening
and this is the palette we're gonna get
into this I kind of want this to be a
short video which is not gonna happen
but a few things really fast in the
front here first off I was planning on
doing kind of like a review and then
doing three different looks but time
kind of got away from me plus I deleted
some of my footage so I'm not really
sure how the format of this video is
going to go I do have some footage from
using this for the first time so I have
some like first impressions on it I'm
gonna try to fit those in before I go
into the actual demo but before that
we're gonna actually get into the review
so let's just get into some facts into
how I feel about this and also really
fast before we get into that I'm gonna
link Kaylee's video down below if you
want a second opinion on this I saw her
review when she posted it which was a
little bit ago and just if you want
another review I really trust her
opinion and yeah I think you'll enjoy
that if you were wondering about Decker
Scarlett so let's just like get some
facts out of the way first off deca
Scarlett is a subscription service you
get a pallet every two months and it
costs 2995 a month now for that price
that includes shipping to your house and
you get it in a very nice box actually I
was kind of surprised like I said it
might get ready with me I was not like I
think the concept of this is a really
great idea but like when it comes to
like price and just other things I'm
kind of just like yeah I'd rather spend
$30.00 every two months on something
else so I was kind of happy with how the
box came it's very very sturdy my little
dusty sorry about that
but it comes in a really nice black box
inside and had really nice like foam
pieces to keep the palette safe it came
with a cover for the palette and if you
can see here with the foam insert the
palette does fit night
and snug in there so it's not gonna be
like moving around I did really
appreciate that and honestly was
surprised to see that I thought it was
gonna be a little bit more um just not
as high-quality I was highly impressed
by that considering what I thought it
was gonna be like I guess so for the $30
every two months you get one pallet this
is what it looks like
you always get three different shadows
two-faced products and then over here in
a separate flap you get lip products and
there's two there and then on top of
that you get a little bit something
extra every single month this month it
was a lip liner and lip crayon duo but I
was looking back at the website and
they've done eyeliners they've done
other lip crayons that don't have a lip
liner so I feel like this piece is kind
of like with discretion depending on who
they're collaborating with that's
another thing about deco Scarlett that's
kind of interesting and cool every
single month when they create these
palettes they collaborate with a
youtuber now I think that's really
exciting for youtubers because I'm a
youtuber how cool is it to create a
palette so like thinking about it that
way I think that's really exciting um
but when I think about what I'm getting
and everything I just I'm not the hugest
fan of this and let's just get into
actually quality review and everything
so looking into the palette like I said
you get the three different eyeshadows
the quality of these eyeshadows is
actually really nice I really like all
the powder products honestly um except
for New York this is a like glittery
black and I'm just not a fan of that I
don't think a lot of people are you'll
hear in my first impressions but
something that kind of baffles me
sometimes when we have collaborations
with youtubers and people who try a lot
of makeup
it's so weird when they do things I feel
like as a general consensus we all don't
like like shot glitter throughout an
eyeshadow I feel like most people don't
like that so I thought that was an
interesting choice like I get that it's
like a fun color but I just don't think
it translates it has a lot of fallout
it's pretty crumbly and a lot of the
fellow it gets on the other powders
which is just something I'm not a fan of
but the other two shadows work really
well they blend out really nicely on the
eye every single eye look I've created
with this I have really enjoyed which
has been nice
quality-wise I don't think there's an
issue with quality I think it's it's
nice quality the highlighter here Pinot
Grigio it's really really beautiful I
have it on today it gives a nice
luminescence to the skin
you could really amp this up if you
wanted to using like mac fix+ or
something
but I think it would also work for
people who want something a little bit
more subtle and then when it comes to
the blush this is actually a nice blush
it looks a little scary in the pan but
pigmentation wise I find that it kind of
like blends out nicely so it's not too
scary you can really kind of like build
it up as you go which is nice the other
side of the palette which let me just
point out I love that they're separated
because getting powder products into
your cream products is like the worst
but honestly this whole side of the
palette could go away and I would not
even care I don't think many people are
a fan of potted lip products they're
just not practical I don't think you're
gonna be getting your money's use out of
these products because you can't take
these with you on a night out something
like this you're definitely gonna want
to like touch up and you can't do that
if it's like you're bringing the whole
palette with you you either have to use
a lip brush or if you use your fingers
you're not gonna get like that good of
an application or at least a precise
application and this isn't something
that's just in this palette again all of
the deck of scarlet palettes have those
like two lip colors so for me this
palette just doesn't seem worth it for
what I want and what I'm trying to go
forward with in my collection when you
break down the payment you are only
paying $30 for two months but it's only
a one-time service so it's still like I
think of it as like it's a $30 thing and
$30 is kind of getting up there to me
for what you're getting the things I
love the most about this palette is the
fact that you are going to get colors
that are curated by someone different
than you so you're gonna be getting sent
something to you that is different than
what you probably would pick out on the
daily and that is kind of fun like I
said I loved every look that I've
created with it so quality wise it's not
bad and it has been fun to kind of go
out of my comfort zone and do some
different looks especially using like
silvers and blacks and although that
like burgundy shade is kind of popular
it's a fun cool mix I do I do like
about it but the whole point of this is
to kind of create different looks and
honestly when I look at this there's not
like a ton you can do with only three
shadows I mean if you really want to
create different looks you're going to
want to pull from other pallets and that
kind of like defeats the whole purpose
of this being an all-in-one palette to
me also something I wanted to point out
is that you can buy these pallets
separately like say you don't want to
sign up for a subscription you can just
buy the pallet and that's gonna be forty
five ninety five which is really pricey
that's more than the Anastasia Beverly
Hills prison pellet and you're getting
14 shades in there really good quality
and in here you're getting like three
eyeshadows and two face products and
some lip products you're not going to
use I wanted to point out something to
you that I thought was just kind of
ridiculous when I was looking at the
website they said that this palette and
the lip product that comes separate from
it is a hundred and thirty one dollar
value and although I get that you want
to like make your product seem like it's
an amazing value I think that's like a
bit ridiculous so based off of their
calculations they think that the potted
lip products over here their value is 14
dollars apiece for the eyeshadows they
value those at sixteen dollars apiece
each of the face products is twenty
dollars a piece and then for the lip
product one side for the lip liner seven
dollars and then the lip crayon is eight
and I just think those are just like
such high prices there's no way anyone
and no one would pay that especially
because I just think that's like
ridiculous
anyway as much as I like the quality I
don't have any issues with it I don't
think it's anything that would a doll
fetch that price if I'm being honest I
feel like thirty dollars is a bit
expensive for this even though you're
only paying for it every two months so
to try to act like you're getting that
good of a deal is kind of weird to me I
didn't mention it at the beginning so
I'm sorry but Mellie Sanchez is the one
who curated this palette so I will leave
her YouTube and Instagram if you wanna
go check her out she's really pretty I
watched her video introducing the
palette and she did some pretty looks I
don't know I thought it was nice I'm
like happy for her that's super cool is
she picked this out it's kind of
interesting seeing why she chose stuff
so that's cool going into the lip pencil
I really like the actual
liner on this guy I didn't know this
actually had a lip liner when I first
was using it I didn't realize it was
double-sided the color is pretty I'm
wearing it today on my lips I kind of
have a little bit of like a darker lip
line going on so hopefully that looks
like cute instead of not cute but the
lip liner is my favorite part of all the
lip products that you get in this
palette or in this shipment the other
side the lip crayon I do not like the
formula of this it's very thin and kind
of grey see I also think it's
interesting that I think that the lip
product is darker than the lip liner and
usually it's the other way around so I
think that's kind of weird
I do find though that I like the
lipstick better with the lip liner I
definitely adds a little bit more
substance to it so I think this is like
not a bad product it's nothing I would
like be so amazed to have but I mean
it's it's okay it's not like horrible a
few more things just about deck of
scarlet they are cruelty free they make
their products in New York so they're
made in the US and like I said they are
a subscription box service so you can
choose to skip months which i think is
really awesome in case you don't want
this also when you sign up you don't
have to pick the palette that's being
curated for that month you can go back
and pick whichever palette you want to
start off with and then from there on
you'll be getting the palettes every
other month they do give you like a 5
day period once they release the palette
to decide if you want to skip or not
which i think is nice and looking at the
website it seems pretty easy to cancel
your subscription I don't know how it is
when you're like talking to people on
the phone but they do have an email and
a phone number on there so hopefully
that looks promising I'm pretty sure
that deck of scarlet is somehow related
to scent bird because I was looking at
their like affiliate program I was just
going and clicking through links and
just checking out their website and
scent bird was mentioned on there so I
think this is somehow derived from said
bird which would make sense they're both
in New York they seem like very similar
situations I don't know I have a very
similar vibe from both of them I
personally like the idea of semper it a
little bit more it makes more sense for
my lifestyle but to each their own
someone might really like this palette
if you do want this palette
you have until the end of October before
we go into the new palette but you can't
always purchase this a little bit later
if you wanted to I have some discount
codes they're not affiliate links at all
so I don't make any money off them but
if this was something you were
interested in after the review you think
it would be fun to try out different
colors or it would fit your lifestyle
that will be linked down below for you
to check out I think you guys are kind
of understanding where I'm coming from
kind of know my opinion on this I would
never buy this this is definitely not
something I would sign up for and
subscribe to every other month but again
I do like the concept of this I think
it's really fun something that put me on
the edge of like potentially wanting to
try this as PR was the fact that it is a
palette and you guys know I love I
shadow palettes so a couple tips I have
just to have a better execution of this
idea would be to totally get rid of the
lid products like I get that this is
supposed to be a whole face situation
but I feel like it's just a lot of
products to put into one and I think it
would be better for more people if it
was more focused and you would just be
pleasing those people more instead of
just putting everything and trying to
please everyone it's like you might like
one shadow but everything else makes the
whole palette not worth it so get rid of
the lip products I just don't think that
I don't think anyone really likes this
and you're going for people who love
makeup if you're doing this a
subscription box like this and people
who love makeup usually don't like
potted lip products I think removing the
face products would also be a good idea
and just focus on the shadows give us
more than three give us six or nine
honestly I would totally pay for
something like the color pop shadows for
$30 every two months and get something
curated with 12 different shadows so
mattes and shimmers you can do a lot of
different looks I think this would be a
better idea for like a monthly
subscription box then what's going on
here just kind of my two cents on it but
yeah I think that's it I'm gonna go into
my first impressions now for the first
time you use this I don't have the
footage where I actually showed how I
did the eye look I'm sorry but I'm gonna
just throw in some snippets of that and
then we'll move on to actually a demo of
this look here which again I think is
really pretty I'm really happy with how
it turned out besides all the glitter
fall out other than that I mean they
blended really nice
I feel confident and pretty in this look
and although this is kind of like
bulking my collection I can't see myself
reaching for at least these two shades
again and also the highlighter so that's
it for my review thank you so much to
deck up Scarlett for sending this for me
to try out I appreciate so much that
they were okay with me having an honest
review
I made sure when we emailed but like
that was gonna be okay and they were
like we're 100% okay with that so I love
companies that aren't afraid of feedback
and that's something that makes me think
of them highly even though product wise
I'm not the biggest fan that is
everything thank you so much for
watching guys and if you want to see my
first impressions and my demo for this
look just keep watching let's start with
our first look from the palette this is
gonna be a first impressions because
I've not used this yet and I thought I
would film it I know you guys are
teasing the review and so these are what
the shadows look like these are a
highlighter and a blush so let's just
get started for this look I'm going
pretty dark and smoky I'm going to be
using this kind of as like a crease
color with the blush and then I'm going
to be really deepening it up and putting
this like sparkly really charcoal gray
almost black color oh I got on my
brush um I'm gonna be putting that on
the entirety of the lid and really
smoking it out using black liner today
like I'm gonna try to actually go pretty
smoky well see how far actually take it
cuz I feel like I always seem like I
want to go so smoky and then by the time
that I like get it on my eye I'm like
I'm good no farther
alright so my first impressions on this
palette quality-wise I do think it's
pretty good I had no issues with like
blending things out the only shade I
really hate is the shade New York one
it's a black which I don't normally use
but - because it has all that glitter in
it I get that it's like appealing and
pretty when you look at it in the pan
but practicality wise I mean I did my
unease first and it still was falling I
used mac fix+ and it still was falling I
used a cream eyeshadow it still is
falling like it just is like too much
trouble than what it's worth I think
there are so many other shades out there
I just don't know why this one was kind
of created and I'm not trying to be
harsh that's just my thoughts on it
obvious
everyone's makeup taste is different
though and if you were making this maybe
you'd like it but again everything else
I used quality wise did work and I do
like that this made me step out and make
a different I look than maybe I would
have normally I definitely would have
probably never made this look or paired
this lip with it so that's definitely
something fun I'm sure you've heard all
my thoughts about this though in the
future in the beginning of this video so
I'm not gonna go too much longer but
those are just kind of my first thoughts
making this I like overall I like the
eye look I think it's really pretty
and because of this palette it inspired
me to create this look thoughts on the
lip color it's a pretty lip color the
pencil is like super thin and greasy
though like it's very shiny a very thin
very strange that someone would come up
with this especially when matte lip so
the trend like I don't know I just find
that it's like when things like that
happen it makes me think that maybe I
don't know like why did you make this
choice but I am going to go on to the
website see if there's like some
information about like her inspiration
behind this palette and I will get back
to you guys on that which you would
already have seen in the beginning of
this review anyway let's get on to
looking for - all right guys hi welcome
to the second part of this tutorial I
guess I don't know how I'm filming this
and I'm sure I've mentioned this in the
intro but we're gonna go in for a second
look this is after I've already used the
pilot quite a few times I've used it
more than the first time that you guys
saw today I kind of want to go with the
classic smoky eye so like this silver
and black and gray um I don't know I
don't really want to add too much of
this in I know it's supposed to be like
a look with the palette but I don't know
I'm trying to like do something
different than that first look but still
something kind of dark because I feel
like this palette is definitely very
like going out that being said my face
is completely clean because they don't
want any of that glitter fall out on my
foundation I
my eyebrows on I used my ELF brow pencil
and just said it with some clear brow
gel and yeah let's just get into it I
already have eye primer on as well I'm
just gonna run some powder over my
eyelids
I'm also zoomed in pretty close right
now so that way you guys can really see
what's going on I had someone like
comment that they would really like that
so I'm gonna try to do that for most of
my like tutorials and stuff hopefully
you guys enjoy I try to keep it pretty
much to a minimum when it comes to like
talking so that way the video doesn't
get like insanely long oh you wouldn't
believe that hearing me right now talk
but yeah so first off I am going in with
a different palette I know I'm gonna use
this color from colour-pop called
bel-air I just kind of want to do a
classic smokey eye and I don't want to
put that red in first it's a little bit
dark and I've used the blush as a
transition before and that worked fine
but again that's just gonna give me a
lot of warmth and that's not necessarily
what I'm looking for so I'm just going
to build up a little bit of a transition
and then we'll go in with I think it's
called Sagittarius now that that's
blended in I'm gonna go in with
Sagittarius like I said that is the kind
of like burnt plummy shade and I'm just
going to start building that up just a
little bit it's just to give it a little
bit more of a deeper base I don't want
too much of the warmth of this color to
come through and you can tell that this
is my like bad eye like if you see
there's like almost like a dent in my
skin I have no idea what that is but um
everyone's eyes are shaped differently
even on the same head so if you have
something like that just try your best
but it's it happens to everyone just so
you know I already feel pretty good
about that I'm gonna go in with a fluffy
shader and we're gonna start going in
with New York which is that very
glittery kind of like black shade this
is my least favorite shade in the entire
palette not including the lip products I
just I was watching Meli's video where
she kind of like introduced this and I
get what she was going with she wanted
something a little bit different than
just a matte black and like I can
respect that but I just it's just not my
favorite
I don't love it anyway I'm building this
up on the outer corner and I'm just kind
of bringing it in a bit halfway or so
and we're gonna blend that silver into
it from the lid over I guess that's that
so we're gonna go in with the last shape
here this is diamond dust and I'm gonna
be putting this on my lid this one's
really pretty I do suggest using like
fix+ or something if you really want a
lot of pigmentation on it it's
definitely gonna make it pop a little
bit more these are not my normal shades
I would pick from but like I was saying
before there is something interesting
and kind of cool about being forced to
go out of your comfort zone to use you
know different shadows that you get in
the mail that you maybe didn't curate
but you can create some really cool
looks wet so I'm still like down with
that part like I like that idea I just
think maybe there could be some better
execution and I'm just gonna go in with
my finger to build up the pigmentation
on the inner corner so I think that's
kind of pretty I'm gonna go back in and
try to build up that black shade a
little bit more see that's kind of like
the issue is that if you're not packing
this color on it's kind of hard to build
up a lot of depth from this it's kind of
just like a darker gray and all that
glitter doesn't really translate unless
you really are trying to like stick it
on I don't know I think this is a pretty
easy eye look though for what this is to
create kind of like a black black and
gray smokey eye it happened pretty fast
alright I'm gonna clean up under my eyes
and we're gonna go in with some face
products and then we'll go in with the
bottom half of the eyes for a primer
today I'm going in with the cokie smooth
glow hydrating foundation primer i'm
gonna be using my lancome stick
foundation that you guys know I've been
loving and I find that that goes on best
with something that's a little bit more
hydrating underneath I've only used this
one once so I kind of wanted to give it
another try see how it went I don't know
why this smells like a margarita to me
smells like tequila and we're going in
for a bit of a more high coverage finish
today because these eyes are a little
bit darker I'm going to be mixing the
our blush vanish stick foundation so
good this is an
Lenin which is too yellow and too dark
and then this is the Lancome taunt idole
ultra wear makeup stick and this is in
the color Siwon cool or onesie cool so
I'm going to mostly put this one over my
face and then I'm going to add in this
yellow or one in just a few extra little
areas and I'm just going to blend that
out using a like buffing type of brush
and now that I have my foundation I'll
blend it out I'm gonna go in with a mix
of concealers as well this one is the SA
Lauder Double Wear waterproof
I like this but it doesn't have quite as
much coverage and it's a little bit like
dark and yellow so I'm gonna be adding a
little bit of the amazing cosmetics
amazing concealer in fair okay
I'm gonna set that in place using a mix
of freakin powders I'm mixing everything
I'm gonna be using the laura geller
powder foundation in porcelain this
one's gonna go in like the highlighted
areas and then I'm gonna be using the
Revlon nearly naked powder everywhere
else again this is a bit of a heavier
look especially for me um I don't know
we're just going a little bit more glam
with it today I did add a little bit
more like red I was just evening out my
eyes because one looked a little funky
and the other one was nice how I wanted
them to look hopefully both good instead
of both funky for bronzer I'm gonna go
in with this one from Kevin a Quan this
is actually a whole palette but I'm just
going to be dipping into the bronzer
side and I'm just gonna use this to kind
of warm up the face the rest of the
products are going to use for the face
are actually in the palette which is
kind of nice for a blush today we're
gonna be using adorable and I'm just
gonna use a little bit of that this is
pretty pigmented but I also find that
you can share it out quite nice that's
something I liked because it's a very
intimidating color in the pan but I do
think that you can kind of work with it
and then for highlighter we're going to
be using the color Pinot Grigio and I
actually really do like this highlighter
it's not too sparkly but I feel like it
could kind of like fit both sets like
someone who wants a big more Quilliam
and someone who want something more
subtle so that's the face all done let's
finish up the eyes underneath I'm gonna
be going in first I think with the Pinot
Grigio and just highlight the inner
corner and I'm gonna bring it
onto the lower lash line as well my gosh
my voice is cracked and then for
underneath the eye I'm gonna go in with
a little bit of Sagittarius I don't want
too much of this I'm just bringing that
a little bit more than half way also
known as like two thirds and then I'm
going to be pressing the black shade and
I know into the outer outer corner I'm
tapping it off as much as possible so
none of that glitter hopefully goes and
we just get some of that gray shade and
I'm kind of bringing that kind of dark
and I'm just gonna go back in with that
original brush we used and just kind of
blend that out I'm gonna go in and line
my waterline with this white liner and
then I'm also gonna put some mascara on
I don't have it out here but I am going
to tightline as well using just like a
dark color I'll probably use black for
this look just because it's so dark but
you could use whatever you want so I
have the rest of my face on I have my
eyes done I'm really liking the look
actually when I went and looked in the
mirror I'm really into it so for lips
today I'm gonna go in with the lip
pencil that comes with it this is
actually double sided I did not realize
that until I was like looking more
information up on the palette so this
has a lip liner and the lipstick I'm
gonna just use the lip liner today and
honestly the lip liner is like my
favorite part out of all of the
different lip products it's just a
really pretty color and it's my favorite
formula as well and then to kind of
lighten that up and just to use a
different shade from the palette I'm
gonna go in with Sasha and I'm going in
with just a lip brush this is a very
very creamy color especially compared to
the other color in the palette and I'm
just gonna blend that into the lip liner
