is going to be probably the longest part
of the declutter slash inventory of all
of these products so we're going to get
into this I don't know how much of this
stuff I'm actually going to to declutter
this is really just a way for me to see
what I have and also tell myself to
never buy a shower gel ever again so
let's get into all this stuff I'm going
to start with the shower gels and stuff
that's in the front here but I mean we
have to get all the way down to like
this basket so it's a lot if you hear
any noises that's cuz Sam's home so
usually he's not here when I film anyway
starting off these are like bath salts
I'm actually gonna be keeping these I
don't take a ton of baths but Sam just
got me these from when he was in San
Francisco and it was super thoughtful of
him and I really want to actually use
these and since they're not like old I'm
going to be keeping these but I will be
getting rid of quite a few other bath
products that I have because I really
don't take that this is another bath
product from L'Occitane it's like a
lavender bath oil I believe or foaming
bath it's lavender scented I will also
be keeping this because I think it'd be
nice to pair with one of those because I
believe one of those is lavender and
it's just a nice product so I'll be
keeping that as well and I'm gonna try
to keep that to a minimum at Sawle I
have four bath stuff if this is
something Sam's currently working on at
sequel of just Body Wash so we're
currently working on it and for the rest
of these body washes I'm probably not
going to be getting rid of any of them
I'm pretty sure it's just kind of me
working through them because I do like
basically all the scents so I have a few
scrubs here this is a lavender and honey
I absolutely love this scent from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works and it is a body scrub so
I'll be keeping that but another body
scrub from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the
wild Madagascar vanilla I've never tried
the vanilla bean body scrub so we'll see
if I like that formula but I probably
will not buy anything from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and I can only like ever I mean
not ever but for a while and since again
I'm working where I work I probably
we'll get other bad stuff or want to try
the stuff at work so I don't see myself
really needing anything we brought the
body works maybe candles but I already
have so many of those too so I'm pretty
much banned from the store anyway this
is a new shower gel and I don't love
this as in it's not my favorite thing
ever but I have used quite a bit of it
because I've tested it out and I'm just
gonna finish it up I wouldn't repurchase
this though and I wouldn't necessarily
suggest it and then yeah just all of
these shower gels I'm gonna be keeping
while peach poppies coconut lime I have
a couple like mini ones I'm also going
to be keeping those for travel but also
just to use up in the shower as well
just because they're minis doesn't mean
they have to be for travel I have this
one I have into the wild like a real
honeysuckle this is like an orchard
Honey Crisp apple butter drum so I just
like so many of these and I didn't pay
for any of these full price I either got
them as gifts or I got them like for
free from Bath and Body Works or during
the semi-annual sale and usually I only
paid like their $3.00 piece plus I'd use
my 10 off of 30 coupons so I would get
like 10 of them for $20 or something
where they only came out to $2 a piece
so yeah that's why I have so many and I
was like a psychopath and stocked up and
so I just have a lot of shower gels so
these two more this is a coconut one I
really like a coconut and apple type of
size this is a bath product this is the
luxury bubble bath I am going to pass
this along I know I could probably use
it as a shower gel but honestly yeah as
we all see you have a billion of those
so I don't need it to use it for that so
I think that someone else can use it as
a shower gel or as a bubble bath or
however they want to use it so I'm going
to pass this along this is something
different this is like a shower gel from
Marshalls and it smells really good like
rose so I'm gonna keep that this is
another one - I got this is almond and
cream
sounds really good and I'm gonna bust
this one out soon for fall and then I
have about six like eight more shower
gels over on this side that I'm also
keeping that are all full-size for about
the libraries I know that's kind of a
lot but it's like I'm not gonna get rid
of any of those because they're gonna
keep until I use them and I'd rather not
repurchase shower gel when I had this
money and I got rid of them I also have
this soap you guys have seen this in a
haul I got it from the farmers market
and I will say I can tell it's dried out
a little and just the time I've had it
so I am going to be using this up really
soon I'm probably gonna put it into one
of like my month projects or something
because I really need to use it it
smells so good and I don't want it to go
bad I did purchase it like not only to
support you know people at the farmers
market but because I actually wanted to
use it so I'm gonna be using that up but
I'm not getting rid of it now onto this
random weird bucket here so I probably
gonna be getting rid of most if not all
the things in here this is a lot of lush
products that are in here and they're
just so old they're crumbly like you can
see it's just crumbles and I know it's
wasteful but this is not good I don't
take bats like that anymore and like
this one is seriously it's just
disgusting I don't want to show this I
hammer I will be getting rid of these
this is like a rainbow unlike this used
to be I think blue and now it's not like
lush has a lot of products that are like
more fresh and whatnot so it's like some
of these are just not not good anymore
this one was from holiday last year I
might keep this one it looks like it
still might be kind of okay it was like
originally wrapped up where those ones
were in the bags after they had already
dried out I'm contemplating this I'll
let you know this is a bath foam I will
be keeping this one this is like a
one-time use thing so I'll be keeping
that
is another bath bomb could be keeping
this one too so some key things I'm
gonna get rid of this one I'll pass this
one along though cuz I think it's still
good whereas the other ones I've thrown
away but this is like has pop rocks in
it and again since it's single-use I
want to want to use it so umm I think
that's pretty good I feel like I kept on
holding on to the lush things just
because they're from lush and that's not
a good enough reason seriously this is
more lush stuff so let's get into that
this was something at one point I will
be getting rid of that throwing it away
I don't even know what this is I think
it's like a mango bar I'll be throwing
that away as well let's see what's in
here this is like a Silver Star I don't
know if you can see in there but I don't
want to get it all over myself but I'll
be throwing that away it doesn't even
smell good and then last but not least I
think this is some type of bath bomb I
think I might save this one as well I'm
gonna keep this one too again this one I
feel like doesn't have as much like
moisturizing properties so it keeps
longer so I got rid of most of them and
now this is empty
moving on to these are kind of already
went through these in my head so these
are three different scrubs from Ulta I
got these I just ordered them online so
I didn't know the smells and I was just
gonna keep them all but I think I'm
gonna get rid of this one I don't like
the smell of it and I have a couple more
scrubs in here too so I just don't need
it I've never used it or anything so I
passed that one along I will be keeping
these two though so this is a coconut
one and this is a vanilla bean or
vanilla sugar they seemed nice
I always want to try them out and see if
I like them I probably wouldn't
repurchase them because I already have
scrubs I know I like so yeah let's delve
into this bucket this is the scrub I'm
currently working on I absolutely love
this it's from malicious smells so good
it's a brown sugar and vanilla one I
would repurchase this after I finish
like all my scrubs in different scents
or the same scent I just really like
these this is another one of my favorite
scrubs is the tree hut Shea sugar scrub
I have Brazilian nut here and I think
I only have this one left but I have
used multiple of these in the past and
it's a great drugstore one if you're
looking for something more affordable
this is a good one I think this is the
last one I have for full-size this is
the fresh brown sugar body polish this
smells really nice I like the smell of
these it's closed though so I'm not
going to open it and I want to use this
up probably next add my scrubs only
because I got this at my bridal shower
and I don't want it to go bad and that
was like a year ago almost so I just
need to use it up and since it's
expensive I want to get my monies out of
my money's worth out of it and not let
it go bad since it was a gift okay we're
doing it guys
another scrub it's just not in a pot
form this is the talk--i toca I don't
know how to say it Cleopatra scent it's
grapefruit and cucumber I bought this at
Marshalls and I just really wanted to
try it out I kind of treated myself to
this item moving on this is another
little small scrub this is from the body
shop in the coconut this is so tiny I'm
also going to just use this up it smells
really nice I really like the smell of
the coconut from the body shop so
keeping that this is a cold cream from a
venn to body lotion I'm gonna pass this
on I got it from work I might just throw
it away I don't know how long this was a
tester at work since I don't know its
history I don't feel comfortable passing
it on and I won't use it so I'm gonna
throw it away this is a body lotion from
hemp's add on a couple of these that
gone through one and I have one more
this is the one I'm currently working on
so I will keep that I like those lotions
too they don't like they're not greasy
on the skin this is a Sally Hansen
airbrush legs in the color medium I'm
going to be passing these on
I don't tan same with this product it's
like a mini cotyledon legs tinted body
lotion I don't need that and I won't use
it these are two more little bath gels
or shower gels so I'll be keeping those
oh I really like this product this is
from the turbo say it's the oxygen
perfecting oil it's like a dual phase
product you shake it up and then it's
like a spray moisturizer I'm going to
get out of the shower or whatever you
I really like that for moisturizing so
of course I'll keep it this is a product
to have it opened yet it's from deborah
lippmann it's the rich girl hand cream I
have a billion hand creams to go through
so I'll be waiting to open this up but
it expires 817 so I have some time I
just don't want to use this until I
finish more up and I have time on it so
yeah this is the apothem skincare
science stretch mark cream I got this so
long ago years and years ago I'm
throwing this away I've never used it
although I probably could use a stretch
mark cream I just don't I never used it
and I'm gonna get rid of it because I
don't it there's no one to pass it on to
and it's old it's really old you know I
have a lot of things that I think I'm
gonna use or oh in theory they be
awesome to use but then I never use that
it's the issue these are two mega rich
body lotions from Peter Thomas Roth
again with like the conditioner I'm
gonna get rid of one and save one just
so I can try it out so I'll be keeping
one and passing one this is a lotion I
actually used to have two of these but I
gave one to a friend this smells so good
it's pear and cashmere woods it's called
oh is it just called autumn I don't know
it just smells so good this is totally
my type of scent like all the time it's
Apple II it's fresh it smells so good I
don't use a ton of body lotion but I'll
definitely be keeping this one because I
love the scent that much I have this
Saint Tropez bronzing instant glow body
lotion yeah it still has the seal on it
so I'm gonna pass it along although it
is quite it is older but it has the seal
so I'm gonna pass it on and then if it's
bad they can get rid of it I have a
Murad detoxifying white clay body
cleanser I'm gonna keep that and try it
out see if I like it oh my gosh I'm
dropping everything this is a body
lotion from Stevie skin labs it's I'm
gonna keep it I don't know maybe I'll
pass it I don't need a body lotion and
this doesn't have a scent or anything to
it so I'm gonna pass it proud of myself
on that one another little shower gel
this is from the body shop it came in
that coconut set I got a bunch of
coconut products from Marshalls and a
little set a while ago I'm gonna keep
that this is a little dove shower gel I
am going to actually be passing this
I just don't need it obviously I have
freaking ton of body gels and shower
gels I don't need anything to cleanse my
body for like years and years so I'll be
getting rid of that just not that it's
not good it's just I have so many other
things I'd rather use in this little
dove travel size thing this is another
hand cream this is a rejuvenating age a
hand cream I'm gonna keep this as it's
great for like sunspots as it has like
that acid in it to help with like
brightening the skin and I want to try
it out this is the Art of Shaving
appreciate oil I got this so long ago
I'm going to get rid of it and I've
never used it I could probably use it on
my legs but let's be real I just don't
want to somebody get rid of it this is
an aloe aloe vera gel from CBS I don't
know how old this is it still smells
fine so I'm gonna keep it I don't have
anything like this so I might as well
I've at least one aloe vera gel and it
doesn't have an expiration date so if I
still have this by the time like next
summer rolls I'll just get a new one two
more products left in here I have this
nukes oil this is like the glittery one
I am going to be passing this to a
friend at work because I don't use it I
won't use it so I'm going to pass that
along and last for that I have this skin
fix hand Repair Cream since winter is
coming up I'm gonna keep this one it
seems like a more intense one yeah I'm
gonna keep it with a lot of this stuff -
I know I'm keeping a lot but it's like
I'm gonna use hand creams it's just I
can't buy any more I guess is really
what this is it's opening my eyes to
like girl you have so much stuff like
use through what you have enjoy what you
have if you're gonna keep it and a lot
of this I am choosing to keep so I need
to work through it let's work on this
one this is a lot of mini lotions a lot
of hand creams like who has a whole
thing full of hand creams that's crazy
this is a totally hand cream I'm keeping
most of these I will be keeping another
little body lotion from Bath and Body

utterly smooth hand cream I just want to
try it out so I'm gonna keep it as well
this is a little hemp mini lotion I've
had this for a long time so you don't
feel comfortable like necessarily
passing it on I'm just gonna throw it
away actually I know that's bad but I've
had this so long guys I know it looks
like nothing's around but look at all
those air bubbles like is that normal I
don't know I'm passing it or I mean
throwing it this is a tan body lotion
I'm gonna get rid of that this is Al
Aqsa Tom hand cream keeping I love this
when my favorite hand creams ever from
them and then another hand cream these
are all the same formula these two are
just like limited edition scents and
this is the original this is a hand
cream from Jane Eyre Iredell it's just a
mini sample and I'm going to keep that I
really like it this is a body lotion
from Bulgari I'm gonna keep this
everything like the scent of this
product and then this is a body lotion
from Paul Mitchell it's lemon sage I
will be passing this along I got this
from a hotel I don't need it I might
just throw it away I don't know if I've
used a little bit of it or not and it's
kind of old so just throwing it away two
more things in here more freaking
lotions um now that I'm looking I
seriously have one too so I went through
and counted up all these little lotions
I have 11
no chance so I have nine of these
lotions I'm gonna try to get rid of a
couple of them because I don't meet this
many I don't like lotion that much so
yeah I'm gonna pass on the pear some
more I like this scent but I have a lot
of things in this scent I don't need it
and then I think I'm gonna pass oops
there where I'm gonna pass country chic
on as well nothing wrong with it I just
needed to get rid of some of them at
least so I got rid of two of the nine so
I have 7 left instead of 9 we are on to
this last basket here this is um body
lotions and like larger shower gels
there's not much in here first things I
have this huge Olay ultra moisture body
wash I got this from my dad and stepmom
for Christmas and I think I might just
try to work through it it's just so much
body wash but it is nice it's
moisturizing so I'll keep it this is the
st. Ives mineral therapy one I might get
rid of this one it smells really nice I
kind of want to keep it but it's kind of
crazy so I mean I don't know I guess
I'll keep it oh gosh it's like why do I
have so many shower gels that doesn't
make sense okay that's it for shower
gels the rest are body lotions in here
thank goodness oh no this just popped
open that sucks well that sucks
um this is the house lotion this isn't
vanilla plum I actually don't like this
scent so maybe I should just pass it on
yeah I'm gonna pass this scent on
actually since it is not my favorite so
yeah in the past one okay this is what I
have left to go through it without much
this is a Scentsy layers
body lotion in the sense that I have the
matching thing - what am I talking about
I have the matching like spray body
spray so I'm going to use this up I like
this and my good friends gave me this
for this like a long time ago
she sees this video she'll know I have
this vanilla and wild Madagascar vanilla
shea butter body cream so I'll be
keeping that I like this formula from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works better than their
regular lotion this is a thousand bushes
in the same formula I'm going to keep
that and then I have Paris and more in
the same formula and I'll keep that then
I'm going to actually pass these two
long these are both just their body
lotions in the full-size and since I
have a small size and I have the pairs
more in the body cream I don't need
these I feel like that was pretty
successful I'm gonna put these like to
the side and I'll show you guys what I'm
getting rid of and throwing away so on
this stuff alright Here I am passing
along two friends so quite a bit of
stuff really happy about that I wasn't
expecting to get rid of so much
especially like the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
stuff for some reason I like to hold on
to it you'd rather use it up and give it
away
but I think that's a good chunk for what
I was thinking I was gonna get rid of so
I will be putting that in the giveaway
pile and then you can't really see it
here but this is all 7:13 way so all of
that lush crap I have decided to also
throw these away they're just old this
one smelled bad so these products are
getting thrown away another lush thing
and the stretch mark cream really good
progress it doesn't you can't tell but
that was about maybe a fourth of fourth
of everything I had maybe a little less
maybe a fifth maybe I'm getting too
excited I feel really good about that
one and I have one more video it's gonna
be kind of like beauty stuff a little
bit random stuff it should be a shorter
one and we then will be done guys so
thanks so much for watching let me know
if you enjoyed these videos and I will
see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
