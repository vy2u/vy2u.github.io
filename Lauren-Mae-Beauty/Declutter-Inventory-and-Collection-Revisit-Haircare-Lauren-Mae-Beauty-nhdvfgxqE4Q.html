this is psycho this is all of the stuff
that's like baths skin care hair care
everything essentially in my bathroom
the reason I decided to pull everything
out here was so that I could see this
visual because this is crazy it's a lot
of stuff and I really just need to go
through it this these videos I'm gonna
break them up because we know I mean
looking at this look at this box like
this alone is full of stuff it's crazy I
know this is gonna be a long video so
I'm gonna break it up into different
parts they don't know how many yet just
because I don't know how long it's gonna
take obviously it'll take a long time
but the reason I wanted to do this and
why these videos I'm posting them is I
really want to declutter but also just
kind of inventory this and get it under
control a lot of this stuff like the
bath and body stuff over here I did have
a lot of that before moving out here
I've added to it a little bit but not
much I really just had a stockpile but
then there are a lot of things
especially that big basket I pointed out
earlier that are all new items they're
all because of the job I work in or a
lot of them are so I'm gonna go I just
wanted to show you the visual first off
of all this crap it's kind of a mix of
everything and I'm gonna go through
right now and split it up I'm gonna
decide one if I want to keep it if I do
want to keep it like if it's something
that I like love and would repurchase
then I don't really have to worry about
trying to use that item up because I
probably naturally just already will use
it up but for other items maybe I want
to keep it but like setting a goal for
myself so that I actually use it up and
just like reminding myself that I have
it and then you know for things I don't
want deciding if it's because it's
expired or a little too old I don't feel
comfortable using it or giving it to
someone or you know is it just something
I'm never gonna use maybe it's not
opened and I can pass it along to
someone or maybe it is open but I can
pass it on to like friends or family so
yeah that's the goal with this video I'm
not promising I'm gonna get rid of a ton
of stuff but I'm hoping that I'll be
strong and really focus on the areas
that I know
I'm not very you know good at using or I
just don't use in my everyday life like
focusing on those areas and really
weeding down whereas if I really do
enjoy stuff then keeping it I mean my
makeup collection is huge but I love
makeup and not that I don't love this
stuff but I definitely don't have as big
of a passion for it as makeup so it's
crazy so anyway yeah I know it's crazy
and I'm gonna go through right now and
sort it and then um I'll pick up from
there where I left off so yeah I'll see
you guys in a second okay hi guys I'm
back I'm gonna start off with the
haircare stuff that's all this stuff
over here and we're gonna get started
it's a lot that hold buckets full and I
started with skin my skincare I started
with haircare because I thought it would
be the easiest for me I'm not that
attached haircare stuff um as you guys
know I wear my hair in a bun all the
time and that's really all I do I love
my dry shampoo and that's kind of it so
hopefully I can kind of use this as
momentum to get rid of more stuff in the
other category since I'm doing this
first that's what I'm thinkin anyway so
let's get into this declutter so I'll
start off with these two here these are
actually the shampoo and conditioner I'm
currently using these are from pure
ology strength care line this is the
conditioner this is a shampoo I'm
obviously gonna just use these up I do
like them I don't like the smell though
so I probably won't be repurchasing
these but I do like pure ology stuff so
obviously keeping those I'm gonna go
through this box next let's start off
with this huge big thing this actually
my mom gave me
it's a leader of the alterna hemp
organics straight conditioner color hold
I don't know why she brought this with
me when she came to visit I'm gonna
smell it it still smells good
so I think I'm actually gonna use this
as a shaving cream and since it has the
pump and everything I thought that'd be
a good way to use it up and I don't use
a lot of conditioner because my hair is
very thin and fine so I think I'm going
to use this as a conditioner for my legs
so I'm gonna keep it so it doesn't go to
waste because I don't
to have wasted this but I am NOT going
to use it for conditioner and that's how
I'm going to make it through this huge
thing this is the not your mother's
beach babe texturizing salt spray I'm
gonna get rid of this I don't like it
and I've never used it since I bought it
so it needs to go yeah one down one no
this is the Dove dry shampoo I love this
stuff I don't like it to use it just as
like a dry shampoo I like it
to texturize my hair and give it some
body I have very fine hair so when I
first wash my hair if I don't put
product in it it just is it doesn't do
anything it just slips around so I like
using this on days they don't actually
put like wet product in my hair this
will give me that volume and grit and
they like it so I'm almost done like
there's not much left at all so I'm just
gonna finish this up and I probably door
purchase this is my second one I think
you're gonna see a lot of dry shampoos
in these videos because again it's like
one of the only hair products I really
use besides shampoo and conditioner
regularly this one specifically is from
Garnier and I have a lot of different
ones than just like my batiste because
Sam when I ran out of batiste I had Sam
go find me dry shampoos and he came they
didn't have batiste and so he just got
me a bunch of different ones so I have
used this it's okay I probably wouldn't
repurchase it just because I already
have so many I have two others that I
just love for sure so I don't know I
haven't used it enough to like say if I
don't purchase I guess but I'm gonna use
it up because I use dry shampoo all the
time this is the American Crew gosh I'm
like shake you this is the American Crew
daily moisturizing shampoo I'm gonna
keep this I go through shampoos faster
than I do conditioners again because I
don't like to like heavily conditioned
my hair it is like a men's product but I
can use it just as much as Sam could I'm
gonna keep that one because then I won't
have to purchase shampoo and that's a
good one when like I'm in between like
let's say for these ones once I finish
the shampoo up which I definitely will
before the conditioner I can use that
one as a shampoo until I finish up the
conditioner as well this is the woodies
for men hair and body wash this is Sam
so I'm just gonna ask Sam if he wants to
use it because I won't use it for
a hair wash so if he doesn't want it
that I'm gonna pass it along it's a
simple one so this is like waiting on
decision from Samuel this is it's a 10
miracle texture fiber I don't even know
what this product is I've never used it
me and my mom went to a hair show oh so
long ago
and part of the goody bags were it's a
ten products we're in them I got a lot
of it's a ten stuff and you'll see all
of it here because I haven't used any of
it I don't know if it's even good I
don't know I think honestly I know this
seems so wasteful I think I'm gonna
throw it away though cuz it doesn't
smell necessarily that but it doesn't
smell good either so I'm gonna have to
toss it I just don't feel comfortable
passing it along to someone and honestly
it's just really old like this is like
years and years old I know I haven't
used it like that's the first pump I've
ever done but this is a hair spray and
this is fabulous fabulous I don't know
how you say it no I've got me this I'm
gonna keep it because I don't go through
hair spray a ton but I need at least one
just to like put down baby hairs when I
need it like if I'm gonna curl my hair
like it's just good to have at least one
hairspray so this is the one I've kind
of already been starting like I'm here
on it but I'm gonna keep this and then
last for this box is this big sexy hair
this is the root Punk yeah this is
something I'm currently working on
trying to use up I don't use it how they
say where you like spray it at the root
it's just too much product so I spray
this in my hand kind of like a mousse
and then I put it in my wet hair and
then blow-dry I don't like just like it
but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it
it's just such a huge bottle and I'm
going to keep it and finish this up
because I do I don't know I mean I use
it this is like the 101 of the only
products I use almost every time I
shower so so I'm gonna keep that we are
gonna move on to the big big booty
basket here these are a lot of backup
items or things I've gone for more
things that were my cabinet styling
products like I don't know this is a lot
of stuff so
this first thing here is like a living
proof little sample I don't even know
what's in it so I kind of want to open
it to see if I know see if I want it
this is the living proof nourishing
styling cream I am going to keep this le
custom all this is is one because I can
actually use it up but I like these
types of products lately because you
guys know I have all those baby hairs
around my head and sometimes on second
day hair they're like extremely insane
so I'll use something like this to kind
of smooth them down in a more nourishing
way than hairspray would do I think I
have a sample of this in a different
packaging that's so old and I'm gonna
get rid of so I'm gonna keep this
because I actually think this is a
product I will use this is a swab dry
shampoo these are this is one of those
shampoos that Sam thought when he was
trying to find me a dry shampoo and
again I'm just gonna use it I actually
think this is a decent dry shampoo it's
not again my favorite I'm not gonna like
probably repurchase but I don't want to
just throw it away because it is
something that I can kind of prolong
buying more dry shampoos although I'm
telling you guys I have probably like
tendrich it's psychotic and I kind of
want to go more natural if I try
shampoos and not get ones with aluminum
which both of my two favorites have
aluminum in them so yeah I have to
figure that out but anyway keeping this
we'll just get these two out of the way
as well these are my batiste these are
backups I went to Marshalls and I got
these when I was there because that's
where I get my batiste and I will be
keeping these because they are my
backups that's why I bought them another
a dry shampoo I know I'm telling you
it's crazy this is the qur´an one and I
do really like this dry shampoo this one
in the batiste are like my two favorites
ever I am almost done with it it went so
fast I don't know how I use this up so
fast but I will be obviously keeping
this and I'll be finishing it up I do
have one more but it's in my kit for
school just in case I needed it for my
final and also just in general if I'm
doing a look there so that one's in
there but I will also be keeping that
one just to let you know this is another
Woody's product this is just for play
hair and body wash again I'm gonna let
see him decide on this because I don't
want to use this at all so if he doesn't
want it then we'll pass it along and
never been used these woodies ones my
mom is a hairdresser so she gets us a
lot of product and that sale seriously
can use a body wash for like six months
like he uses the tiniest amount of body
wash
whereas I like a drench loofah it just
takes him forever to go through it so
again I'll have him decide if this is
something he would use more of those
it's a ten products this is the miracle
firm hold hard firm hold gel I am going
to definitely get rid of it this doesn't
smell bad kind of like it doesn't smell
bad at all just smells normal so I'm
going to pass this one along to someone
who can use it this is a finishing spray
by eight to ten which is essentially I
think like hair spray I think I might
keep this one too
I don't know which one I like better out
of the two and I think I'm just gonna
keep it so I'll never have to buy
hairspray probably ever again in my life
this is the miracle styling cream again
I'm going to be passing this on I'm just
gonna smell it yeah this still smells
good I don't know what it is what that
texture is in paste though that one just
didn't smell a bit to me someone
definitely can use this one it's just a
styling cream this is a Garnier Fructis
conditioner I'm going to be passing this
along you guys know I don't go with your
conditioner and I just don't want to use
this I also have one in my shower that I
think I'm gonna get rid of too because
this part broke and so if there's like
all this part was stuck in there and
then I broke down the cap but this part
stayed so there's like a hole in it and
honestly I just don't really like the
smell of these and I just don't want it
I don't want it I'm gonna pass it along
and I think someone else can enjoy this
this is the new blow out mist I'm gonna
keep this it seems like something I'd
like for volume and since we sell it at
work I do want to try these products and
be able to give customers feedback on
them so I'm gonna keep that I probably
we're gonna keep most of these I did
have a styling cream that I got from
them but I gave it to a co-worker
because I thought he could use it more
to have already passed along one of the
items I even got in the original basket
these two go together this is the
shampoo and conditioner this is the
stressing one I haven't busted into
these because I wanted to finish the
other ones that I'm already using first
as soon as I finish those I'll probably
be using these next and I'm not going to
get rid of all this is you know a nice
shampoo and conditioner to use I'm fine
with having backups as long as it's
something that I will eventually like go
through another Numa product this is the
tangle me free it's a detangler I'm
gonna keep this as well again I want to
try it and I don't have a detangler like
this and I want to see how it is on like
fine hair if I hate it I'll get rid of
it but I haven't even used it yet I
believe this is the last name or product
this is their argan oil treatment
I love argan oil in my hair I use the
Moroccan oil which is argan oil and I
love that one so I'm gonna keep this one
this is also skin grade argan oil so if
I wanted I could use it on my skin as a
moisturizer as well so I feel like has
multiple purposes its colorless its
endless it's a really good product and I
am going to be keeping that too this is
the it's a 10 miracle styling mousse I
probably could use this up but since I'm
already using up the big sexy hair in a
similar fashion to a mousse and I have a
couple of their mooses that I'm going to
be getting I think I'm going to pass
this along I've just had it a long time
I don't I'd there's just I'd rather use
other ones so I don't want to waste my
time on this and someone else can use it
so I'm gonna pass this along this is a
styling product this is the GF laser
take serum for hair it's a soy milk
strengthening serum I am gonna keep this
I have been using this and trying it out
it's not like the most my favorite
product that I've ever used but it's
okay I'm gonna try to use some more of
it and I don't have any other products
like this so I think I'm gonna try to
use it I have two Moroccan oils here
this is the one I'm currently using I am
about here on the bottle and that's the
reason that I had my mom buy me this one
as a backup because I didn't want to be
without it she usually gets me this for
Christmas I love this I love
well it is expensive but it is amazing
so I'm going to obviously keep both of
these because I know I like them this
also my mom brought me when she came to
visit this is the strength cure pure
ology fabulous bling links treatment I
am currently using this as well probably
what it repurchases product I don't find
it's doing something amazing for my hair
but I am gonna finish it up it's
expensive and it is a newer item in my
collection so I'm just gonna keep using
it and using it out have I gotten rid of
anything is getting so as you just gonna
see in here it's all like mini sizes
this stuff well not a mini this is a
full size this is a hair mask from Renee
Fortier I'm gonna keep it it's supposed
to help like thicken the hair I don't
have any masks and they're not something
I really use a ton but I do want it just
in case I want to try it out I haven't
opened it also I feel like you know it
can be good for a while so I'm going to
be keeping them I think this might be
the last full-sized
product in here this is the bumble and
bumble thickening full-form mousse this
is part of the reason that I got rid of
that it's a 10-1 because I do really
want to try this one out and it has
quite a bit in it so I know it's already
gonna take a long time to use up the big
sexy hair and then also use this one up
so I'm gonna keep this obviously but
that's just why I decided this a blow
dry volumizing gel from big sexy hair I
think I'm gonna pass this along because
I don't like something so crunchy in my
hair so I'm gonna pass it this is the
big sexy hair or healthy sexy hair so we
try we leave in conditioner I got this
in an empty bag and I know so many
people love this I also have the Numa
one though I might I'm gonna keep it for
now and if I don't like use it up I'm
going to try to put this one maybe in a
project though to get it through it
because it's a mini
I feel like it's more doable plus it'll
be good to travel and I am going to Peru
soon so I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna keep
it these were those little living proof
things that I had this is the nourishing
styling cream which I'm already keeping
in that new form zone I'm going to
actually throw these away these are so
old I can't even remember when my mom
gave these to me but it was when I was
living with her like I moved these from
her house and into my apartment which I
lived in for two years and then when I
moved out here and I've already been out
here seven months so yeah they're really
freaking old and they need to go so they
are going in the trash sorry if anyone
wanted to try these it's not to be
wasteful it's just they're too old they
really are this is the natural mother's
hair
DejaVu do style extender I don't find
that this extends my style but I kind of
use it off like a styling cream and I'm
using it in the way that I want to use
that living proof one so I'm gonna
finish this up I'm actually like over
halfway done with it so you will see it
in an empty soon I have two of these
kind of volumizing powders these are
hard to tell how much you have left of
them I'm going to keep both I don't have
a preference really one over one over
the other I like to use these in my hair
when I'm trying to give my hair volume
but I won't obviously be repurchasing
this until I run out of something and
even then it's not a must-have
I do enjoy using it but yeah I'm just
gonna use them up I have another little
mini Moroccan oil I'm gonna keep this
this is a great one for travel and again
I love the Moroccan oil I have a shampoo
and conditioner of the clear scalp and
hair therapy total care nourishing
shampoo and conditioner I'm gonna get
rid of these I don't want to use them
I've no desire to use them and they're a
cute little set for someone else so
they're gonna go bye-bye I'm gonna do
the same thing with the easier the pyah
pyah organics conditioner and shampoo I
got these from a hotel me and Stan me
and Sam stayed in and I just don't need
them I have
so I am going to pass these along since
it's a cute little set as well this is a
shampoo and conditioner I've had these
for a while Sam's mom I believe gave
them to me I don't know if they're part
of the Melaleuca so I'm gonna keep these
and try to use these up I might bring
them to Peru or I might try to use them
just in my shower at home I really don't
need travel sized stuff I feel like I
get them often enough at work or in
different ways that I don't need to be
keeping all these for travel it's a
kaftan to your travel and honestly I'd
rather just go out buy a little shampoo
and conditioner for that trip and only
have it instead of hoarding all this
other stuff and never getting through it
so I am gonna keep these ones though and
try to use those up soon or bring them
to Peru to use them up this is a big
sexy hair
weatherproof hair humidity resistant
spray I'm actually gonna keep this and
try to use it up it's a mini size I
think it's a good one to have in my kit
also like for makeup because honestly as
a makeup artist you were and you have to
have everything you have to have straws
and everything that anyone could ever
want like snacks anything so I want to
have like a little hair kit and I think
this would be nice to put in there this
is the Oscar blondie texture and volume
spray I'm gonna keep this as well and
just use it up I probably wouldn't
repurchase it but I got this in I think
a bag and Ipsy bag as well and I think
it's half way used I can't remember if I
like it
but if anything this is something I want
texture and volume that sounds perfect
to me so hopefully I like it this is a
pure ology radiance enhancer or
amplifier anti frizz and shine spray
it's a mini size I'm going to get rid of
it I I don't know if I've used it or if
it only came half full because sometimes
samples aren't like all the way full to
the top but I'm gonna get rid of this
and pass it along I don't think I've had
it that long or it'd be bad or I feel
weird giving it because I don't even
remember using it so I really don't
think it's even been used so
passing it it's so awkward because it's
nighttime and everyone can see him
because we don't have proper blinds and
yeah I have huge lights on and I'm
talking about all this crap on my table
how awkward anyway these are bundled
products I just actually hauled in a
gratis haul I'm gonna keep these these
are all about their new product BB full
potential which is about not only
thicker hair now but keeping your hair
longer and keeping it thick so these are
gonna be great products for Sam to use
I'm also going to use them as well
because I already am seeing thinning in
my hair and I'm only 23 which is so sad
but my dad also is bald so I'm not that
surprised
so I'm gonna keep these and we will
definitely use these up this is the new
me hydro punch hydrating conditioner I
don't need a hydrating conditioner so
I'm gonna get rid of that it is kind of
old I went to look at it it has a seal
on it but it's like the seal is like
gross I'm gonna get rid of that I do not
think that's good anymore yeah
definitely not good anymore throwing
this away
this is something I've got four markets
to klore on um it's a shampoo with flax
fiber it's a volume and texture shampoo
I'm gonna give it a go it's just a small
size and again I run out of shampoo and
faster than I do conditioner so yeah
it'll be a good one to just throw in
somewhere these are the I believe that
you pronounce it tan aromatherapy
shampoo and conditioner I am currently
using up the body wash that matches
these right now I'm gonna pass these
again they're out from a hotel and I
just don't need them
and since they're such a cute little set
I think it'd be better to pass them to
try to use up for me personally
these are super old these are the Bath
and Body Works coconut lime verbena
volumizing conditioner and shampoo I
don't have much of this so I'm just
gonna use these up these are really
reminiscent to me of Europe when me and
Sam went right after I graduated high
school because that I bought these in
the full-size to take with us because we
were going to be there a month and so
whenever I smell this scent all I can
think of is like being in Scotland and
traveling so it'll be kind of cool to
use these up one to get them out but
to remember that scent memory so yeah
keeping these to use up though I only
have four products left thanks for
hanging in with me guys this is the
Malon and goats melon and gets I think
you say it I don't know I got this in a
epsy back it's a cilantro hair
conditioner I've really wanted to try
this so I think I'm gonna keep it it's
gonna smell it and make sure it's not
bad it doesn't smell bad
it's a cilantro one I think I just want
to try it I think it sounds really cool
and I'm interested in this branch so I'd
like to try this I have two things left
this is the Rusk calm shampoo I really
like this as well it is kind of minty
and tingles your head and I want to use
this up too so it's kind of older so I
need to use it up soon it'll probably be
in like a project use it up soon so be
looking out for that and then last I
have two of these Peter Thomas Roth mega
rich conditioners I'm only gonna keep
one of these I don't need to and I'm
just using it because I want to see what
it's like he only gave me two
conditioners he didn't give me the
shampoos that matched so I just want to
see what it's like since they sell it at
work and get rid of the other one
because I just don't need to and I doubt
I'm just going to like fall in love with
it so this is the basket of things that
I'm getting rid of so it's quite a lot
that's two again Sam's gonna decide on
but it's quite a bit of stuff I feel
really good about that that's a lot of
stuff to be passing along definitely
less clutter under my sink and then I'm
also throwing away sadly these four
products they just are expired they need
to go so that is it for my hair and I
hope that this is probably gonna be one
video but it's probably long so thanks
for hanging in with me I'm gonna
continue on tonight and continue to
declutter oh it's a lot of stuff again
thanks for all the support and I hope
this inspires you to rid yourself of
anything you don't like or do you really
love the things you do love and and use
the things you love because they will
expire and you might as well enjoy what
you're using and if you don't like
something sometimes it's okay to let go
of it and pass
to someone else anyway that's everything
for this one I will see you in the next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
