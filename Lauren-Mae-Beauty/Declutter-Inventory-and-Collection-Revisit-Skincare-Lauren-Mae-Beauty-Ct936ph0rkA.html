are moving on to skincare items if you
haven't seen part one of this video I
will link it down below probably you
should watch that because I kind of give
my disclaimer or my whole idea what I'm
doing this is kind of a way to just
physically see all the things in my
inventory and to kind of get rid of
everything I can like I can let myself
part with as well as just a visual
reminder of the stuff I do have to try
to use it up let's get into skincare the
first thing I pulled out is my nukes
detox serum I really like this I'm using
it up and I will continue to use it up
until it's gone so keeping it another
product that I use daily is the realest
ill micellar water i've gone through one
of these before and this is my second
bottle i'm definitely keeping that this
is something in my back stop currently
this is the LMS soothing apricot toner
I'm keeping this because I only have one
other toner that I'd be using currently
and I really like these types of sprays
I think they're great for makeup I think
they're great for skincare so I will be
keeping that as well and I will be using
it once they finish my other one up I
have two of these or lon neck creams
these are the firming serum for the neck
and decollete I am going to be keeping
one for myself and then I did snack one
for my mom which I'm really excited to
give her that because this is quite a
price the item I think it's $125 but
they came and trained us so there was
one left over and I snagged her one so I
will be passing one and keeping one so
something out that's nice this is real
Estelle's aqua cleanser it's a face
cleanser but you can also use it for the
body it smells so bad it like rose I'm
currently trying to use up a face wash
but I'm going to keep this because I'm
probably gonna put it in the shower and
maybe use it for both I'm not really
sure but I will be keeping this I really
do like this product another face
cleanser part of the reason I think I
might use that other one as a body wash
even though you will see in my next
videos and I have too many of those as
well but anyway this is a sensitive
cleansing wash I'm going to keep this to
me and my husband share our face washes
and we only have I think three right now
which I know is still a lot but we won't
have to purchase is what I'm saying so
if I can avoid purchasing and be using
higher-end skincare why not and I got
this for free from work so I will be
keeping this and using this up this was
the
toning like face miss that I was talking
about using before this is from Florida
France and it is the pure lavender face
and body mist I really like this it
smells like lavender it smells super
good sorry if it's out of focus and I'm
going to be using this up I'd like a
quarter of the way done so it won't take
long because I've only been using this a
couple weeks so I really like this and
keeping it this is a mask by nature
passe this is also something I will be
keeping I don't have a lot of masks
honestly especially not in full size I
think this might be my only one I really
like this it smells so delicious
I really enjoy this and I will be
keeping it and using it and enjoying it
this is a face scrub this is dr. gold
fattens doctor's scrub advanced there
are two versions of this the original
and then this one is even more gritty
I've talked about this in a gratis haul
so I'm not going to go into details but
I do really like this I won't I will be
keeping this and using it up but I will
never be finished like this will take me
years to finish you need the smallest
amount this is an eye cream from
mdsolarsciences
I got this because they changed the
packaging and so I was able to try this
out it has a very silicone II feel I
have been trying to use it and I think
I'm gonna keep it and try again to use
it but the pump dispenses quite a bit of
product so you can't use a full pump for
both eyes so while I was using it I was
like kind of dragging it down the face a
little bit more and then I was thinking
about it like I hope this doesn't break
me out and then the next morning I woke
up with a massive temple so I don't know
if it broke me out or if I'm just crazy
but I will be keeping this but I'm
definitely gonna make sure I'm just
using less product and I just want to
finish it up I just want it gone so I'm
gonna keep using this and if I don't
finish it by the time my mom comes to
visit me I might give this to her that's
what my plan is for that another
naturopath a product this is the end be
suitable I think tolerance recovery
cream this I think is expired it just
smells gross to me I do not like the way
this product smells and if that's how it
smells normally then nasty I don't want
to use it anyway so I'm just gonna pass
it along I mean not pass it along I'm
going to throw this out I hate to do
that because it is expensive but it's
gross I think it's bad I just no no no
no
this is something I don't even know what
it is this is the brighten up and
enzymatic face rejuvenizer with papaya
and micro crystals and aloe I don't know
when I bought this I don't know if it's
bad I can't even remember when I got
when I got this though doesn't really
have a smell to it I think I'm just
gonna pass it already throw it in the
trash I just don't know how long it's
been since I've had this I feel like I
didn't just get this so that means it's
definitely a couple years old so since I
can't put a time on it and it didn't
have a seal or anything I'm just gonna
get rid of it this is a Dermalogica
product this is the SPF sport SPF 50
sport sunscreen I'm using this right now
currently on my face as my facial
moisturizer for the day I really like
this and I would continue repurchasing
you in so definitely going to finish
using it up and I like it this is an eye
cream formula still I haven't really
tried this out so I'm gonna keep this
and work on this once I finished the md
solar sciences and then these are really
the only two eye creams that even have
gonna keep that around this is like a
perfect one for me too it's kind of
preventative but it's not super anti
aging I mean it's good to prevent but I
really just want moisture with anything
so that I am you know stopping the
formation of wrinkles as much as
possible I have about six billion
samples of josie maran
I have one in a project use it up I am
using another one because spoiler I did
finish that already and I have these
four so this is just the regular argan
oil this is also the regular argan oil
okay so I realized why my camera shut
off and is because the batteries die so
again I won't be keeping all of these
because I will use them up and done with
these I'm done talking about this is the
Cape Somerville Retta sphere micro peel
I'm gonna keep this I don't have any
treatments like this so I'm gonna keep
it and if I don't use it I'll probably
pass it on to my mom but I do kind of
want to try it out this is a product I'm
also going to be throwing away this is
the Jurlique fruit enzyme exfoliator I
took this from work because it was close
to being expired and we did one on the
shelf anymore it was a tester and it
already expired I used it a couple times
it wasn't anything special to me and I
don't need it and it's expired so it's
going bye-bye now this is the first date
Beauty face cleanser I'm gonna keep this
it's a nice little travel size this
would be a good thing to put in my
makeup kit because you need a bunch of
travel size type of stuff in your kids
this is another nature of a safe product
this is a inhibit tensile lift
this isn't super expensive product I've
talked about it in a gratis haul again
but I will be passing this on to my mom
to use as like it's kind of like Botox
in a bottle so she can use this and
enjoy it I don't need it and she'll get
more use out of it this is a Clinique
little minions is the Moisture Surge I'm
gonna keep this and use it either at
night or in the daytime depending on
whatever I use at first and it all
stopped me from having to buy any
moisturizer hopefully a brand will come
give me a free product before I run out
I'm gonna keep this because I do like
this product I've used it before I have
this mini Korres mask this is a wild
rose and vitamin C advanced brightening
sleeping facial actually it's like a
sleeping night treatment I don't know
I'm gonna keep it I haven't opened it
because I didn't know what I'd use it
but I'm gonna try it out eventually
somebody keep this product this is a
product I'm currently using this is the
murad acne spot fast fix this is what I
use if I get any breakouts and I need
them to dry up pretty fast so I'm gonna
keep that this is the Murad rapid
collagen infusion Phillips I still
haven't opened this I'm going to keep it
in the packaging and again I'll see if I
want to use it if not I'll pass it on to
my mom and I'm gonna keep it though for
now I don't know how much of this stuff
I'm actually gonna get for those
honestly skincare is something I didn't
have a ton of before coming here so even
though I've collected a lot of stuff it
really isn't that much like I don't feel
like for how bad other areas of my
clutch
this is the Dermalogica pre cleanse I'm
going to keep this but again I think I'm
gonna put it in my makeup kit because I
don't personally really like it for
myself but just texture wise it's not
something I like having on my skin but
this is a great one to get off makeup so
if you were on set or something you
could get someone's makeup off easily at
the end of the night and also moisturize
their face without stripping it and
derma was a great like skincare brand
these are the murad invisiblur
perfecting shield I'm gonna keep both of
these these are great minis are great
primers for the face I'd love to have
these in my makeup kit I also want to
try one myself it has SPF but it still
is invisible how amazing this would be a
great one to also have in Peru and stuff
so although it looks like a lot I just
have it in the boxes in case I decided I
didn't want it it'd be like better
packaging to pass along I guess no one
would think I used it or something so
anyway I'm going to keep them though
because I definitely think I will like
these and get good use out of them
another Murad product this is the rapid
collagen infusion it reduces the
appearance of wrinkles and fine lines
I'm gonna keep this and use it up and
yeah when I need a serum when I run out
of my like nukes one which I'm pretty
close to I can use this one but I can
also use this other Murad product which
again I will be keeping this this is the
Murad rapid age spot pigment lightening
serum I don't have like age spots but I
do have a lot of acne scars and
hyperpigmentation so I'm going to be
using this I finally have stopped
breaking out definitely was hormonal
because I was so stressed out from like
living here and everything so my skin
has finally adjusted and now that I'm
not breaking out like actively I'm going
to be using this to help lighten those
spots and help even out my skin tone so
when I finish the nukes I will be going
on to this product this is an LMS
product and it is actually little
capsules of oil it's kind of like a
detox treatment for your skin I'm gonna
keep this I think it'd be really nice to
try this out we sell it at work and so I
can let people know how it works maybe I
could do a video even like first day and
then like the end of it I thought that
would be cool but I'm excited to try
these oils out for sure I have a mineral
screen from pool it's just small sides I
just want to use it up because sunscreen
is always great to have it's not expired
it doesn't expire until February of 2016
so I'm going to use it up and it's
sunscreen this is a vents deep pigment
I'm gonna also keep this because it's a
dark spot Lightner so it's not as like
intense as another one and I did want to
try this out to see how it works a lot
of customers now this is the miracle
worker your eyes are the windows to your
soul not your age it's like an eye cream
I'm gonna get rid of this and pass it
along because I don't need it I have two
right now and it's gonna take me forever
to get through them so I'm gonna pass
this along probably to my mom I have a
baby oil here it's been not vanilla it's
lavender and I'm gonna use this up this
would be like seriously - facial
applications so this will be easy to use
up and out of my collection this is
something that I'm actually going to be
throwing out this is the Lancome
Visionnaire advanced skinny corrector I
have had this so so long me and my mom
bought some stuff from Lancome because
you got a bag full of crap if you spent
$50 or something and seriously it's been
years and I still haven't used it so I
just don't think it's good I've opened
it before it's just crusty and nasty so
it's going in the trash stumbling I have
some different ultra luxe samples here
this is the retinol renewal serum this
is the micro venom night complex this is
the eye lift complex and this is the day
complex I'm gonna pass these all in to
my mom I don't need these or just pass
it doesn't have to be my mom's I have
some CV skin labs these are all really
good for sensitive skin it's just the
calming moisture I'm gonna keep it
this is the skin bomb again I'm gonna
keep it this would be great to have in
my bag it's a nice one and then this is
the rescue spray this is great for burns
or anything so I'm gonna keep all of
these I really like these products I
would potentially repurchase this in the
full-size I have a couple real estelle
products here this is the different
moisturizers fluid moisturizers I'm
gonna keep these and put them in my kit
use them on people at school but that's
how I'm gonna get through these I'm not
gonna use them probably on myself
it's no keyways razor and it's safe to
like put on anyone
so that's how many use those two little
masks this is the glam glow youth-led
team will exfoliate treatment I'm gonna
keep that I love glowing glow masks and
then this is the origins clear
improvement charcoal mask for pores and
I'm gonna also keep that because that
sounds wonderful
lots of stuff I'm honestly not getting
rid of a time but I'll show you what I
am I'm passing basically everything I'm
that's still good on to my mom because
it's a lot of anti-aging type of
products and skincare that's higher end
so I know she'd really enjoy it I will
be throwing out four items as well in
this one so sad but true so that's
everything for this part for skincare
this one was quite short but I'm telling
you the next one it's gonna be body care
and it's a lot of crap so be prepared
I'll see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
