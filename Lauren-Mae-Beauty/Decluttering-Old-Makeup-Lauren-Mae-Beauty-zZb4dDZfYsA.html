Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we are gonna be decluttering my
old makeup I'm doing this a little bit
different than my other two clutters I
feel like I'm mostly sorry I don't know
where to be and I'm just like chill
right now and like a sports bra and
pajamas so anyway I wanted to go through
my whole makeup collection and get rid
of things that are old and just kind of
do a really like speed declutter so I'm
just gonna be like making snap decisions
getting rid of really old stuff going
with my gut this whole declutter stems
from my old makeup video that I posted
and all the inspiration that I mentioned
there as well as even more videos that I
keep seeing from people so definitely go
check out that video if you haven't seen
it before so you can kind of know where
my inspiration is for this stuff because
a lot of what I'm getting rid of I
consider and deemed to be a little bit
too old for me to feel comfortable
passing on depending on what it is I
might just be tossing it because it's
that old I might give my mom the option
of taking some things it just depends on
what it is and how I feel about it so
let's just get started and yeah I'm
basic I got the Alex drawers mine aren't
the 9 drawer set but I hope the lighting
isn't too bad and I also hope that the
focus isn't too bad I do have a manual
camera so it doesn't autofocus and yeah
it kind of sucks so first off powders
here I honestly this is something I want
to give one more try to it's not my
favorite but I've only used it once I
don't have a ton of powders I've worked
through a lot of them if you guys are
watching my finish 13 by Halloween you
guys know this the only thing is I think
I'm gonna get rid of this powder because
I have one here so I'm gonna get rid of
this smaller Ben Nye fair translucent
powder and keep the big one this is a
lot of product to go through and I'd
rather just pass this on and then this
just so you guys know is where we will
be putting all the Deford stuff so yeah
okay foundations I have a lot of
different foundations so I really want
to clean up this first off I know I want
to get rid of this Maybelline foundation
I'm gonna zoom it maybe that'll be
better
as Emden hopefully that's a little bit
better but I'm gonna get rid of the
Maybelline a better skin foundation this
color is just way too peachy for me this
is in the shade it's 15 ivory as you can
tell I've used a lot of it so yeah I was
mixing it with my Revlon one so getting
rid of that this Milani one is something
that I haven't used it's not my color
I'm just getting rid of it like I was
gonna do a whole video on it and I just
haven't and it's just too dark and I
don't want to mix it and I don't know
man I just I'm over it so I'm getting
rid of that I do like this one I like
these this is the Revlon one I'm gonna
keep it because it's nice for its own
color for me so I'm going to keep that
this wet-and-wild foundation I don't
really like this guy so I'm gonna get
rid of it I don't care I don't like it
this vivillon cream foundation you guys
know I'm trying to work through that I
have a couple little samples and I'm
gonna keep those this is the kiss Pro
touch liquid cushion foundation I did
use this once I haven't used it since
it's not that it's bad it's just I
haven't reached for it I don't think I'm
going to reach for it and it's quite
light for me so I'm gonna get rid of it
this is something I want to use that by
the end of the year it's the Sephora
like spray foundation like the Dior one
I do like it and I'm gonna keep it this
is something I'm also gonna get rid of
it's the geomap moisture tint I did
really like this product I've used up
quite a bit of it and it expires in
April of next year and I just won't be
dark enough to use this this is in the
color linen and it's just too dark for
me I like my number 7 foundations I'm
gonna keep those and the glamoflage is
not my favorite on its own but it is a
nice mixer to light you foundation so I
will keep that as well I feel pretty
good about that for this drawer
none of my foundations are too old at
the moment and I'm working through a lot
of them so I feel really great about
getting rid of those just extra
foundations I don't need let's move on
to concealers over here I'm gonna
readjust somehow my makeup forever
Foundation got in here I love this one
so I'm keeping that obviously - this is
concealers I hope you guys can see it
this is just like a paper thing I'm
gonna get rid of that I haven't used it
and I thought putting it in my concealer
drawer would be good but it just feels
like clutter and I'm
getting rid of it my bare minerals
concealer I don't really like this I'm
gonna pass it on Kat Von D also don't
like this it always creases on me I
don't want to use it up I'm gonna pass
it on these three color correctors I
don't dislike them I really like the
formula they're nice I've talked about
them before but someone mentioned in a
video where I use is there like it
didn't do anything for you and I don't
know I kind of agree
it just doesn't give quite enough
coverage for me and what I need if I'm
gonna use a color corrector so for sure
I'm gonna be getting rid of this one I
am gonna keep these two at the moment
and just try them out this one here is
like a green one and since it's so pale
I'm hoping that it might work for my
skin I just haven't really tested it out
so I'm going to keep that this one is
new it's the Estee Lauder Double Wear
waterproof concealer I do want to give
that a shot since obviously it's new
the amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
I haven't tried this enough to be like I
like it or I don't and I do like it for
mixing with concealers that are a little
bit too dark for me I'm gonna keep it
I'm gonna keep this Etan one I really do
like it my favorite one I own at the
moment is the Milani retouch in a race I
just think it's really nice everything
else in here I'm gonna keep this is new
- this is the Clarins mission perfection
second eye cream but also has a tint to
it so I just put it in here for the
moment everything else though I'm either
working on using up still want to try
out and nothing in there is too old
alright we're moving on to primers I'm
so sorry about these funky freaking
tangles I don't even know guys it's hard
to film in this little room so this is
one of my favorite primers I'm obviously
keeping that I don't know should I take
this out maybe yeah that's a little bit
better right okay just trying to go off
of my thoughts getting rid of the sample
packet because I don't need it next I
want to get rid of this Revlon one it's
basically done so I'm getting rid of it
this one here from laura geller is like
a match stick primer I just I don't know
how old this is so I'm getting rid of it
other than that everything else in this
drawer is like newer to me or I'm in the
process of you ending up so I feel good
about that this is the next drawing on
to you
this looks really desolate I think you
guys think I have a little bit more
makeup than I actually do I do have a
whole kit worth of makeup but that
usually stays in there so anyway I have
my bronzers over here in contour powders
I like everything at the moment except
for this wet and wild so I'm gonna get
rid of that it's just not my favorite
I don't like love it and it doesn't need
to stay I have some cream products here
the milk makeups one of my favorites I'm
gonna get rid of this one here from hard
candy I was trying to use it up but I
don't care about it I'm getting rid of
it I'm gonna zoom in on highlighters
over here because I do want to get rid
of some of those these are all my
highlighters this is just empty palette
as well as all this stuff over here is
just empty palettes for just different
things I do oh my gosh I feel like this
the clutter is in the same okay I'm
gonna keep this laura geller
I really do like it this is something I
really like from philosophy but I will
be passing it on because it's just old
philosophy doesn't make makeup anymore
whoo you can see me hi guys
mary lou manizer I feel like this is so
similar to Becca's moonstone and if I
had to choose one I'd probably choose
Becca over this so I think I'm gonna
actually pass on the mary loumanizer
that product isn't that old but I just
don't feel like I need it and I'm not
gonna get to it in time when I consider
that I'll probably buy new stuff and all
that so love this one from Urban Decay
it's just like a single shadow I love
this one from Laura Geller I'm working
on this one moonstone I'm keeping I do
like the essence pure nude this
bareMinerals one I really like it and
I've hit pan on it I'm not ready to let
go of this one yet so I'm going to keep
that I have two really nice ones over
here Laura Mercier and a Bobbi Brown
these are this one doesn't really work
for me but I'm gonna keep it for my kit
just in case a time arises and this one
from Bobbi Brown it's something that is
so beautiful but I don't use all the
time I'm gonna keep it because it's not
old so maybe somehow I'll revive those
in the future but I'm very happy with
what I did end up getting rid of we're
moving on to my blush drawer and I
didn't like show you the full thing but
let's just get into this I do have quite
a few I want to get rid of I'm getting
rid of this tart one it's in exposed and
I love this color but it's just old it's
in the really old packaging I just think
it's too old and I have so many other
blushes so I'm getting rid of it
I have three
start minis and I feel like between the
packaging and the colors of the actual
blushes they all look so similar I know
for sure I'm keeping this one this came
in the birthday set this year I really
like it these two I still kind of like I
don't know I'm gonna keep them for now
and just be aware of them I don't feel
like either of them are too too old to
not be you know to be getting rid of
this one is also from chart it's the
tartlet blush it's like and celebrated I
really like this and I'm gonna keep it I
have a couple more years on it
this Milani blush is one of my favorites
I used it so much I did get rid of quite
a bit of it doesn't even look like I got
rid of that much but I did use it for
quite a bit but it's just old and I need
to get rid of it it's just too old I
like my Clinique blushes I'm keeping
nude pop I'm keeping plump up I'm
keeping it cherry cola I also between
these two I kind of want to get rid of
ginger pop because it's just you know I
feel like I'll use peach pop over this
so I'm gonna get rid of ginger pop I
have these two Too Faced minis I'm just
gonna keep those for now this is a girl
lactic blush and I love it
I'm not gonna get rid of this even
though I have had this for a little bit
so it's definitely something I want to
keep on my radar
but I just I like it too much and I
don't have anything similar enough to it
at the moment rocket or something I'm
working on so I'm keeping that I love
this blush from Illamasqua again this
one's a little bit older but it's
something I know that I love and I use
so I want to keep it I really like this
blush from Eden minerals
it's just such a perfect peachy shame so
I'm gonna keep that this is the balm
frat-boy
and I'm gonna get rid of this I love
this blush but it's just I have too many
things similar and it's just getting old
so I'm gonna pass it on these I don't
think I can bear to part with at the
moment this is the Sephora Pantone from
marsala I have the one from like radiant
orchid - I even hit pan on that blush or
I even have pan on that highlighter and
then I have the Becca afterglow I like
all of those I'm going to keep them at
the moment the last couple over here I'm
gonna keep all of these as well this is
something that's really nude it kind of
can replace my Tarte exposed blush I'm
going to keep that those I'm going to
keep this one is just like
sentimental blush though I will for sure
be keeping that this little Stila thing
off to the side I'm gonna be passing
this on it's just getting old and I
might just throw it away I never used it
I feel like why did I even buy this but
I did anyway moving on it's gone I'm
gonna just move this out of the way and
we're gonna get to the back blushes back
there so moving on to this these are all
like different little palettes this is a
laura geller like blush bronze
highlighting thing I just got this and I
do like it so I'm gonna keep that one
this is one of my favorite things in
here this is the kiss ombre radiance
palette loved this just got it this year
this other one is a highlighting one it
needs to go my highlighter drawer I
really like this again got it this year
the Kevin of Kwan one I also just got
and it is very similar to the kiss one
I'm keeping it though because I want to
do a review and I don't know I can
always use that in my kit this is
something that's a little bit older this
is from NARS it is the virtual
domination palette and honestly I don't
know why I thought why did I buy this
I'm going to use up Laguna in here so
I'm gonna move this into my bronzer
drawer but once this is gone I'm getting
rid of it this peach sheets really
pretty but it reminds me of other
blushes I have this is I believe orgasm
which is again really pretty but I have
it and then these two this is just like
glitter and I'm over it so yeah I want
to use the bronzer up because Laguna is
a nice bronzer but other than that I'm
ready to pass this on and then last for
blushes are my laura geller ones
honestly these are just the ones I kind
of go to so I do want to keep them for
now I don't use them all the time but
they are some of my favorite blush
formulas and I feel good about keeping
all these at the moment I feel super
good about all the different blushes
that I cleared out I feel like I got rid
of quite a few and honestly I don't
think I'm gonna be that sad there are a
few I feel like I could part with I
don't know let me just take a second
look I guess plump up and the Too Faced
one are really similar I'll get rid of
the Too Faced one I don't know I'm gonna
get rid of actually both those little
two-faced I know they're tiny and that's
great but the clinic ones are like so
similar in color
there's no reason and I just love this
formula I feel pretty good about that I
feel like oh my lord
geller are like things I would use every
day and then I have just options here
and I could also I don't know I just
feel good about getting rid of things
that are older and I like to consider
the fact that I am gonna want to
purchase new makeup as it comes out I
try to be good about not buying
everything but you know to make room for
some of those newer things you have to
let go of the old stuff guys and I feel
really really good so far about this
just to give you a little shot we're
getting rid of all that makeup and oh
there I am again let's let's not we
we've seen enough of me I'm so happy
about this because as much as some of
this is old some of it isn't that old
like some of it definitely could get
some more use out of but when I think of
me and my collection and the fact that I
have a makeup kit and just the fact that
I know I'm gonna be bringing new stuff
in it feels good that these things that
you know don't get enough love aren't in
here anymore so I don't have to feel
like I have 700 concealers but I only
like four of them enough of that let's
move on to this bottom drawer so this is
the next or these are all like I
products and different things I have a
lot to go through in this I know it
doesn't seem like it but I do so I'm
gonna zoom in on colour-pop first and
we'll go from there okay so for color
pop I have quite a few different things
I have such a love-hate relationship
with these freakin shadows they're
beautiful but they dry out and I never
use them but they're still so pretty and
when you do use them they are beautiful
so I am gonna go through really fast and
I'm going to get rid of the ones I just
don't have a connection to that I don't
really like and that are dried up so
we'll see how that goes I'm gonna get
rid of Farrah it's dark and it is kind
of creamy but I never use it I'm gonna
get rid of Bill I do like it but it's
just kind of drying up that's the thing
that sucks about these things like I
love Cornelius but it's dry and I like
the matte formula I'm like one of the
only people in the world but they just
get too frickin dry I'm gonna get rid of
mixed tape this is party time
oh you guys can't even see what I'm
trying this is party time getting rid of
that Bay is one of those shadows that is
just so pretty and I want to keep it but
it's just too old I should not be
putting my on my eye I'm getting rid of
it so I kind of cut them in half I don't
know I got
quite a few those ones I'm gonna keep
they still have some life on them back
here just so you guys know these are
like mascaras these are all the ones I
have open at the moment in fact there I
have just like fresh ones so I'm keeping
all of those I don't have any issues
with my mascaras at the moment
turning over let's talk about some of
this stuff these are my steel of
glitters this is where I keep a lot of
glitters I just did a shoot with a lot
of glitter so that's why there's no
other ones in here I need to like move
them back but I'm keeping obviously
these steel ones I just got them this is
one of the issues I have a lot of these
Urban Decay freaking liners and they're
old guys are so old and I'm gonna get
rid of them so getting rid of all the
urban decay except for I might keep
stash because I have already been
working on it so this is like the only
one I'm gonna probably let myself keep
and it's the most neutral one that I
have other than that I'm getting rid of
one two three I'm getting rid of five
different eyeliners they're all in fun
crazy colors which I love but they're
just too old definitely to use on the
eye and then part of me wants to be keep
them to like use on the face for like
different looks but I don't really do
that that often and I have water paint
it just needs to go I feel like that's
an excuse to keep them I have some by
Terry eyeliners I'm gonna keep the blue
one because I know that one's newer but
this one was like a tester from my old
store and I haven't worked there in like
two years so it needs to go this Clarins
one's good this is good this is a this
is an old Rimmel scandaleyes I'm gonna
get rid of that I have this one from
kiss and it's a very very similar in
color like they're almost the exact same
color so I'd rather keep the newer one
look that's the two of them like they
look exactly the same so I'm gonna get
rid of the Rimmel one this is almost
done this is the only one I'm keeping
this Urban Decay one is such a hard one
for me I'm pretty sure they don't make
these anymore and I'm pretty sure mines
old and I got off all cosmetics
wholesale so I'm gonna get rid of this I
did just use this in a tutorial though
so I definitely need to pick up maybe
some type of base or use my color pop
shadows as bases or something because I
really don't have much but I'm gonna get
rid of this this one from Rimmel I do
like it I don't want to get rid of it
it's just so pretty I'm gonna keep this
for now I bought this when I moved here
so it's not the oldest but it could
you know I just need to watch it I think
that's everything from in there I feel
really good about that most of these
things are newer and I feel comfortable
using them and the last thing here our
brow products I'm gonna be getting rid
of this black up one thank you to who
linked me to Kimberly Clarke's video I
feel like I saw it but I just must not
have remembered I did get this from
Oxley but um yeah I just don't want to
support this you guys won't be seeing
any black up stuff on my channel and
yeah so I'm gonna be getting rid of that
I have two here that I like other than
that I feel pretty good
most of stuff is getting use or I like
alright we're gonna move on to one of my
first eyeshadow drawers I'm gonna try to
be really good about this guy's I hope
the focus is okay
peanut butter and jelly I am keeping
Smashbox I am keeping this one from kiss
I'm so torn because I don't want to just
have high end stuff and I think this is
a really pretty palette I'm gonna keep
it a little bit longer it's not old my
Miah Miah and my Anastasia tamanna'
palette are getting old but I still
really like them I just have this in my
makeup basket and I got a lot of use out
of it and I'm still enjoying it so I'm
gonna keep it and this is just something
that will have to go soon I'm getting
rid of this wet and wild
it's so old guys it's like the first
thing you buy when you get into makeup
on YouTube and I still have it it needs
to go this is something from Physicians
Formula and I do like it
and I just recently hit pan on that so
I'm gonna keep that and try to get some
more use out of it before like next year
half end of the year I switched up the
angle a little bit hope you don't mind
this is my Eden mineral squad keeping
that I'm also gonna keep this wet in
wild it's not too too old and I still do
like it this is tough these are my only
depotted shadows that aren't like
singles you can buy and I feel like I
still like them I'm
I'm gonna give these until the end of
the year and we'll see where I'm at
we'll see how I feel I have hit pan on
two of the shades here they do get used
I do like them these are my Urban Decay
shadows that are kind of like different
like I have solstice in here on
different things they are not too old
and I'm gonna keep them for now and I
don't use them all the time but when I
do use them I enjoy them sorry I'm like
in the frame
I've modern renaissance over here
keeping that I have my deck of scarlet
palette I just got this in the mail I've
done one look with it and I'm keeping it
because I still need to review it color
pop palettes love those pastel goth a
lot of that I'm trying to show you guys
my single shadows here so I have a
backup of anasazi --is orange soda
keeping that this I still need a try so
I want to keep it I have a lot of these
kiss singles and keeping Anya I have a
lot of these kiss singles and I don't
need all of them so I'm going to pass on
all of these Purple's it's not that
they're bad quality it's just I have
singles so I don't need these so I'm
passing on those three some of them
aren't even opened this I'm going to
keep because I like the pink
I like this yellow and I like this
orange and then these blues I'm gonna
keep this blue but I'm gonna pass on
this darker one I love Urban Decay's
tonic and this is like a really pretty
glittery thing actually I'm gonna put
the glitter with this shadow with my
Stila stuff okay I feel good about that
we cleared out quite a bit guys with the
kiss shadows it's just I feel like I'd
rather pass them on and someone get some
awesome use out of them than me just
hoard them to have them in case I want
to do a kiss look like I'm not really
into that I want to use products as I
like them and not necessarily just do
full phases of stuff because we're
moving on to the eyeshadow palettes I
know it doesn't look like I have a lot
because I kind of don't guys I think
again my kit and different things I
don't know I just don't even think of
myself having some of those items
anymore because they're just in my kit
all the time anyway these are the
palettes that I have not in my kit at
the moment and let's go through them
first off I know I'm getting rid of this
one from Tarte I don't use this anymore
it's getting old and I don't want to
have it anymore
I'm keeping Urban Decay's electric I
love that mega switch-up change the
angle once again so I'm like bending
down right now okay I'm gonna get rid of
both of these Kat Von D palettes they're
beautiful I love them I never use them
yeah I think that a lot of people said
they use this all the time and didn't I
I know I was one that was like it's Jo
pretty and I never use it I'm getting
rid of that and I'm not gonna use it the
thing is sometimes didn't go for my kit
but it's like I use the things I love to
use in my everyday life in my kit
because I know they work that's what
I've tested it's what I know and love
and I don't know and love these and I
wish I did and I feel stupid for buying
them but that's just life and you live
and you learn and I'm passing these on I
probably will pass these on to someone
as much as they're old to me I think
that someone could definitely still get
some good use out of them and I don't
think they've changed or turned in
quality where it's like unsafe to use
them it's just for me and my collection
of my goals I don't want them obviously
I'm keeping this I haven't even done my
review on it it is coming I promise I
just I've been on an emotional roller
coaster with this palette guys so I'm
keeping that I love my ice cream palette
from dose of colors I am keeping that as
well this is something I really like
bought it this year today what's the
kathleenlights palette keeping that my
metal matte palette from Kat Von D this
is something that I kind of regret but I
don't want to get rid of it still new
it's only like a year old so I want to
keep this in my collection try to get
use out of it again these are shadows
that I could potentially use in my kit
and what not because of the different
colors I'm just not ready to completely
say bye to this because I do think the
quality is nice it's just I haven't used
it much and I if I could go back in time
I wouldn't purchase it but since I did
I'm gonna keep it for longer until it
gets a little bit older I'm not like
where it's like dead but see if I use it
a little bit more or somehow revive it
if we turn our faces over here these are
all my single shadows and keeping those
for now I do want to do like a single
shadow declutter so let me know if you'd
like to see that where I'm just gonna
I'm gonna purge quite a bit you know I
love doing the let's do pits and I still
want to do those but some of my Coastal
Scents shadows are just old and I don't
know I just I only want to keep the ones
I want to keep regardless of if I want
to do let stupid I don't want that to be
a reason I'm holding on to stuff I hope
you guys understand that I still want to
do the let stupids and just do like
inspired palettes especially if I don't
have anything that's a hundred percent
similar and the thing is I want to
continue to buy new single shadows and
replace those colors if I don't have a
more if something looks interesting so
that's kind of where I'm at with that
let me know what you guys think down
below and then finally we're moving on
to lip products honestly I feel pretty
good about almost everything in here I
don't think I need to get rid of
anything I just did that big declutter
at the beginning of the year or kind of
like in March so it's like I don't have
a ton of stuff so I'm gonna keep this
for now and just kind of monitor what
I'm using what I'm reaching for
everything in this corner back there
that's all stuff I've decided I don't
have in my collection anymore but I just
haven't had the time to to pop them and
put them into my kit so okay I think I'm
ending this video here if you guys want
to see me do haircare and different
things like that that are in my bathroom
I kind of just want to do like a get rid
of and purge of a lot of old stuff let
me know down below if you want me to
film it and you actually want to see it
also let me know about the single
shadows that is everything oh my gosh
thank you so much for watching guys I
thought this would be fast and it really
wasn't last couple of thoughts though I
did want to say that I am so proud of
all the makeup I just got rid of for me
decluttering is something that is a
constant it's like as I get new things
how you feel about the things you
already have changes and maybe you like
it better you like it worse and since I
know I do I want to buy a new makeup and
I want to buy new stuff I want to keep
my makeup current and not too old and
I'm really glad this makes my makeup
feel fresh and I'm excited I'm excited
to pass some of this stuff on to people
who will enjoy it because lord knows I
haven't been and I hope this gave you a
decent look into what I'm kind of
working with when it comes to makeup I
don't have I I mean it's a lot don't get
me wrong but I don't think it's as much
as people think maybe I have
no let me know if that's even true if
I'm crazy I want to show you guys really
fast
what we're getting rid of this whole
bucket it's huge it's so much stuff
mostly I mean I'm so happy with those
blushes because I'm telling you it's
like it takes so long to get through
blushes and ha
it feels good all I can say is it feels
good I hope this inspired you guys if
you were on the verge of getting rid of
stuff and I really don't want to have a
personal connection to my makeup like
you know where I can't get rid of stuff
I don't want to be like that I've been
doing a really good job of like
distancing myself from it and I'm really
proud of it
and I can tell with this declutter that
I'm I'm being successful at that goal so
ok I'm stopping I hope you guys have an
amazing weekend and I will see you in
the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
