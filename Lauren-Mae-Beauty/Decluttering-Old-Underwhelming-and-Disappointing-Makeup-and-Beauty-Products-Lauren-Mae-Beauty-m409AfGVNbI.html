Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be showing you the
items that I've recently do cluttered
sometimes they do with a clutter where I
show you guys and I we're going through
together and then sometimes they just
show you the things that I'm choosing to
get rid of because it's kind of taken a
long time there are things I've slowly
like been like oh I don't want this
anymore and I put it in a bag I always
have a bag going next to my makeup
collection of things that I just don't
want anymore
things that are working out or I'm just
I've grown away from I think that
declutter is great and I constantly
declutter my items I don't like to do
like just one yearly thing so it's just
a constant moving and shifting as I'm
moving things into my collection I like
to move things out and you know just
keep my collection fresh and the most
mean it can be so before we get into it
I do want to mention that my nails like
really really dirty and they look dirty
because they kind of are I was on set
all weekend and one of the things I was
doing was like dirtying people up and
yeah so it's fake dirt but it is dirt I
guess anyway I have this entire bag to
go through this is gonna be a really
long video but I have a lot of things in
this bag and I'm gonna try to start with
makeup but it's gonna be kind of random
and then I have a whole another section
of like hair stuff and whatnot some of
the stuff I had already collected but I
did just tonight want to go through my
collection just like get rid of stuff I
honestly filmed like a vlog style video
of me doing this because I really didn't
want to film and like get my hair and
makeup done and all that but it just was
like really crappy and you guys would
have like thrown up because the footage
was like so shaky so I figured I would
just suck it up and show you guys what I
did get rid of so anyway let's just get
into it I know it was a long intro first
for makeup I have some palettes I'm
getting rid of this is the lorac mega
Pro and this was a coveted palette when
it came out not that many people got it
and there are all these figs going out
this color palette just doesn't inspire
me anymore
I feel like this came out right before
the trend of like really really warm
orange colors because really only
caramel Fon and set the O or sepia
however you say it are like kind of
that warmer vein and then mulberries
like a nice cranberry but other than
that it's just I'm just over it I'm so
done with it and it doesn't inspire me
anymore so I'd rather pass it on to
someone who is going to love it
mine is used in abuse if you can't tell
and yeah I just I don't even want to use
it in my kit anymore this is another
pallet of shadows I'm getting rid of
these are all depotted shadows and I'm
gonna be keeping the Z palette I just
want to get rid of these in our shadows
and these two-faced ones I love these
and I really did use them but they're
just getting old and I honestly haven't
reached for these in the past six months
or so so I think it's just time to get
rid of them I've had some really nice
palettes come into my life recently and
I know that I would way rather use those
than dig into this old thing so they're
gonna go I've decided that I'm getting
rid of my deck of scarlet I do have a
whole review on this palette and just
deck of scarlet in general if you guys
want to check it out I'll leave it
linked this is just not my thing the
colors are pretty and I made some nice
looks it's not that they're not
pigmented I just I don't want em I'm
just more into single shadows than I am
into this where I can kind of like move
things around or I just want something
with more options this is just too
limited to me and then also on top of
that very specific so it's not even like
a really neutral limited palette it's
like quite interesting it's just
interesting it's just not me and that's
fine so I'm going to pass it on
hopefully someone who will get some good
use out of it I will say that deco
scarlet reached out to me and like
wanted to send me another palette but I
was like I don't want another one but
they mentioned in that email that they
have new single shadow so at some point
I might try to try those out and see how
they are because they look really pretty
and I did like the quality of the
shadows in that palette I just I don't
like the idea of the palette as a whole
anyway the next palette I'm getting rid
of is this one from Laura Mercier and
this one's beautiful this one's a little
bit harder for me but I'm just really
trying to be real with myself and all
the new palettes that I've recently
bought like my jus vias place the hood
of beauty like little mini palettes I
have some of the color pop little mini
palettes all of those I feel like I
haven't even used that much
and there's no way I'm gonna want to use
this over them so I think it's just time
to pass it on I love the color of fresco
but I believe you can buy that as a
single if I really really wanted it I
really thought there was a spider on my
wall for like two seconds that really
freaked me out anyway I'm gonna pass it
on to someone who can love it more it's
also getting just a little bit old like
it's not old where no one can use it
it's just it's time to go I believe this
is the last palette this is from kits
and this is the hexa palette in pink
nude these are really nice shadows I
think they're really pigmented
especially for a more drugstore priced
item it's just that I don't reach for
this I've used it a couple times so I
figure out the quality but it's just not
something that I'm gonna reach for over
other things in my collection if you're
on a budget and you see this and you
want it I think it's good but I'd rather
someone else actually use it I have
three different brushes that I'm gonna
get rid of this is the elf mask brush I
use this and I didn't like it although I
will say it was with a mud mask and if
you're using this with a more like a
thinner mask or something that wasn't so
I guess dry or like thick it might work
better but it's just a waste of time to
me so I'm gonna be passing that on this
is just something I don't use very often
I know it's dirty so at some point I
used it but honestly I never use this
brush this is a brush I just got off of
ebay and then this is a real techniques
brush and I use this for so long it's
the blush brush but this is so old and
like frayed I have had this for probably
five or six years it's just time that I
get a new one and I just have other
brushes I've taken its place at the
moment but I would repurchase that brush
I really really enjoyed it this is kind
of random but I have a Zen tan like deep
bronze luxe cream with the mitt I got
this from a friend and it's unopened and
I'm never I'm just not a self tanner I
guys I seriously put my hair up in a bun
everyday I do my makeup but like I'm not
the type I can barely shave my legs like
I'm definitely not like tanning my whole
body I'm just not that type of person I
don't care that much I'd rather like be
out hiking and get a natural tan or
whatever it is then I would put this on
my body and like stick
like it just sounds absolutely horrible
and like tortured to me so I'm gonna
pass the song as someone who will love
it and be so excited to sit and Tan
their body I also don't want to be one
of those people that's like oh sorry
about my fake tan on my hands which I
just you know I get people prop to or
her gonna spend the time doing that I
can't really put a mask on my face like
just my face I cannot imagine
seriously tanning my entire body next
I'm getting rid of this ELF sponge trio
I really hated the quality of these
sponges they're really hard they're not
worth the money these retail for $12 but
luckily I got them half off at six but
even for that price it's not worth it
pick up a Real Techniques sponge if you
want something super cheap there are so
many good sponges on the market the
l'oreal ones i've heard are great the
Ecotools one i've heard it's great I've
also heard about the flower Beauty one
like there are just so many other ones
besides the Beauty Blender if you want
something inexpensive do not go for this
one
even elf themselves I think have better
sponges than these ones so don't be
tempted they look beautiful in the light
packaging but they're not I'm gonna try
to run through my lip products pretty
fast I'm getting rid of this Revlon kiss
balm I love the other two that I have in
the peach and the coconut scent but this
Apple one it just is tinted red a little
bit and I haven't used it really since I
bought it like I've used it a couple
times so I know that I'd rather use
those up than use this so I'm gonna pass
this on this is from covergirl and it is
the jumbo gloss balm and it's in the
shade I don't know it just says 210 on
it I just I've never used this I bought
it because it was on clearance and that
was stupid
I have a liquid lipstick here from Oprah
and kathleenlights in the Havana nights
I got this at generation Beauty so it's
a little bit old I'm not gonna pass this
on to anyone because it's that old and I
like that it was a red kind of burnt
orange e shade in my collection and I
would love to have a nice like red
liquid lipstick but this one just needs
to go I'm getting rid of this colour-pop
lippie stix in the hello kitty
konnichiwa collaboration this was just a
little bit more pink than I thought it
was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a
little bit more like mauve and it wasn't
so I just don't use it I don't really
like the lippie stix formula I haven't
tried the matte X which is the one I
want to try but I
enjoy this this is a little TARDIS lip
paint in the birthday suit because it
was for our birthdays last year I just
never used this and so I thought it
would just get rid of it I have a lime
crime lip Velveteen lipstick is that
what they're called yeah and this is in
cashmere I don't really wear that color
I bought it and really wanted it and I
never wear liquid lipstick so that was
stupid I have a g-way one this one I got
for free at generation Beauty when I
went like again two years ago almost
three years ago I think this is in petal
de rose really pretty color I don't like
this formula though I find that it kind
of like crumbles off the lips for me
again I'm not really into liquid
lipsticks but I specifically just I have
other things that I think I like better
than that one I'm getting rid of this
lorac pro pencil these are matte and I
really like these but this one is quite
old and I have two of them and this is
the color I definitely use the least out
of them so the other one I need to use
up this is in mauve and it needs to go
how many times can I say that this is an
elf lip gloss thing I recently got this
but I just don't like it it's a waste of
my money and I don't want it anymore
and then this is a lip gloss from
colour-pop investi I've complained about
that I don't know how many times so you
guys know I don't like it I didn't like
the way it felt on the lips they don't
like the way it looked on the lips and I
find that colourpop lip gloss formulas
are just really inconsistent so good
luck if you're gonna order lip gloss
from them I have to kind of concealer
items this one is from Clarins and this
is the mission perfection broad spectrum
like I thing it's tinted but I forgot to
turn the lock so it's super gross and
that just kind of turns me off from
using it I know that's kind of stupid
but it's true
this is tinted to kind of like help get
rid of dark circles I find that the
orange is just a little too orange for
my skintone if I use too much of it you
can see it I think this would work
really well for a more medium skin tone
and I just find that I wasn't reaching
for it I'd rather just use a regular
clear eye cream then use this so I'm
gonna pass it on and maybe my mom will
like it I'm also getting rid of the
photo focus concealer from wet and wild
this was something that I really
disliked at first and I did
use it more and enjoyed it more but it's
just not something I really reach for I
prefer my Maybelline fit me and my
Milani won over this I always reach for
them over this and so there's no reason
for it to sit in my collection anymore
I'm gonna get rid of it I have some
foundation sticks from laura geller this
one is in golden medium i have medium
and then i have light
I bought these originally from a kit and
I found that I wasn't really reaching
for them over my liquid foundation so I
was like okay I'm just gonna get rid of
the medium and golden medium and I will
start using the light shade because I
find that these do run quite light
because usually a light would be almost
too dark for me I'm like in between
porcelain and light or fair and light
but this one especially in winter but
this one is quite fair anyway I think
this looks pretty when you swatch it on
the back of your hand but this just
gives no coverage and so if you want to
build it up to actually get some amount
of coverage it just turns weird with any
product I use it with it doesn't play
nice with others I just I cannot find a
way to make this work I've worn it on
camera once and it turned out fine then
and then the two times I've worn it
since then I literally had to take my
foundation off with a wipe because it
was that bad and I'm not the type of
person do that I'll just be like oh I'm
a kind of looks like today but this
one it no no no so I'm getting rid of
those maybe for someone else they'll
work I don't know if it's what it is I
use different primers it was just the
same result and I didn't feel like I put
too much on but and they still had no
coverage it was just it was just a weird
situation I don't think I've disliked a
foundation as much as I dislike that one
I have a couple face powders on getting
rid of this one is from ELF and it's the
pressed translucent mattifying powder I
found that this isn't that translucent
it does have a bit of a color to it and
I just have so many powders right now
that I would use over this so I figure I
might as well just pass it on and then
the other one is one I've had a while
from Maybelline this is the better skin
in number 10 porcelain I think that this
powder it looks light but I feel like it
just always turns me a little yellow the
texture looks nice on the skin I just
there's something about this powder that
I can't put my finger on it but I don't
quite like it on me I have two
highlighters this one is kind of a hard
one to get rid of actually both of these
are this is the indiscretion highlighter
from Laura Mercier this was before any
other colors came out so this was like
the first and only one when I bought
this so it's a bit older I kept it
because it's like oh I could use it on
set or like I don't know but this is
just a bit too dark for my skin tone so
it doesn't work for that it's quite
glittery it's not my preferred
illuminator style and I never used
something like this in my kit honestly a
lot of the stuff I do for like TV and
film doesn't require something that is
glittery at all and honestly if it did I
have other things to make something work
so I'm going to pass this on and
hopefully someone will really enjoy it
and like it it's a nice luxury item I
think more the matte baked highlighter
is more my style from laura geller than
this one and the other one here is from
bareMinerals this is the love affair
highlighter I have already hit pan on
this so I've made some really good
progress
I've enjoyed using this this is just
light it's not too dark for my skin but
it definitely doesn't leave too much of
like a luminous glow I just have so many
other highlighters again I use over this
I love the sheen this gives the skin I
think this is great I just think there's
so much product in here there's no way
I'm going to be able to use this up or
reach I just don't reach for it over
there the things it's just you know I'd
rather someone else use it and it's
getting a bit older than me keep it and
it just kind of like goes bad we're
getting close to the end of this bag
kind of I have a few different like
powder type products this is from Laura
Mercier as well and this is like a
golden bronzer it's called golden mosaic
it's a shimmer block I think you would
use this as like a highlighter type of
thing obviously it would be too dark for
my skin tone I've kept this around for a
long time in life more my kit type of
makeup but again never reach for it I
feel like that's almost an excuse so I'm
trying to get rid of that because I find
that I really like to use things that I
know and love and trust when I work on
set and on other people I'm going to be
passing on this Milani eyeshadow in
Bella Mandarin I thought it was Bella
Mandarin ah
not um it's really pretty I like it a
lot I think it's a great drugstore
eyeshadow I'm glad they make it
I just don't reach for this over other
things in my collection and this is
something I recently got from ELF it's
the pink pal like duo and I love the
concept of these I think the shadows are
fine they're not insanely pigmented but
I don't mind a subtle shadow I just know
that I won't use these much I thought I
would use these more already than I have
so it's just there's no reason to keep
it when I have again Juve is place which
I think like the pink shadow in here I'd
rather have more of a glitz and glam
than I would the one in here I have two
more lip products this one is from
two-faced it's the melted peony
I've just had this one a while I never
use it so I'm going to pass it on and
then this is a lip pencil from bite this
is in the number 68 I got this somehow
randomly for free I'm wearing the
lipstick it came with today cuz I wanted
to try it out in sweet cream I think
these colors are okay they're definitely
not my favorite style but I definitely
am NOT gonna use the lip liner I think I
would use the lipstick over this so you
guessed it I'm getting rid of it I have
a brow pencil here from billion dollar
brows and I just don't ever use this I'm
just not that fussy when it comes to my
brows and so I don't need this I don't I
just don't need it
two eyeliners this one is from by Terry
and it's beautiful it's like a really
cool ball blue oh so pretty I want to
keep it but honestly I never use it and
it's just too old it needs to go in the
trash like even if I wanted to use it I
shouldn't and then kind of similarly
this is a steal a pencil and it's in the
shade angelfish it's such a beautiful
like rose gold oh wow it's like dried
out didn't even know yeah it's like a
pretty rose gold but I never use it
because it's not dark enough to really
define anything but it's not light
enough to go really on my inner corner
so I don't even know where it use it but
the color is just so pretty I didn't
want to get rid of it but now that it's
dry it out it definitely makes it a bit
easier doesn't it we're just gonna run
through the last few items in here
because I'm telling you this video was
so long this is the spackle tinted under
makeup primer from laura geller and
champagne i just never used this so I'd
rather pass it on while it's still good
I really like a glowy primer but
one just doesn't do it for me this is a
really tiny sample of the bareMinerals
bear Pro Foundation I just don't like
this I don't like the way this looks on
the skin I've mixed it I've worn it
alone it just kind of it looks fine when
you first put it on but I don't like the
way it wears this tends to look really
patchy on me I it emphasizes like dry
patches and texture I don't I just don't
like it and then I have some Ben Nye
products these were in my kit but I'm
just gonna get rid of them because
there's no way I can go through these
and what I already have in my kit by the
time they go back this one's mellow
yellow this is great for like darker
circles you can use these this to kind
of like liven up anything can use it as
concealer - for someone who's a little
bit darker or like a highlighter I like
to even have this in two different
things just to change the tone of stuff
I have this Ben Nye character shadow and
it's kind of a purple it has like a
purple undertone to it so it's kind of
weird it's great for like theater makeup
if you're trying to do like some old-age
makeup yeah like something more
theatrical though and then this is Ben
Nye scream highlight in ultra light this
is a very very light color it's
obviously not white but it's it's pretty
close to it it's great for really fair
skin tones if you need it or for like a
really highlighting concealer but again
I have quite a few these are like
duplicates that I already had so that's
why I'm passing them on this is just a
little sample of the bite stuff that I
got for my birthday and I'm passing it
on this is something that I got at
Costco and the reason I'm getting rid of
this is because I have a small version
in my kit and then I have a medium
version in my own bathroom and this is
the large version and I just know that
there's no way in hell I can go through
all this Egyptian magic by myself so I
think my mom will actually really like
this I think this is nice but this is
some thick moisturizing cream I've
already used some of this one when it
was when I was really dry and Sam was
really dry I used like a spatula to get
it out because I would didn't really
want to make it too unsanitary I like
this I would never purchase a Costco
size of this again although it was such
an amazing value I think it was like $40
for all of it and that's pretty good
it'll last you a long time but let's see
it says used by 1119 and
no way I could use this by 1119 like
everything that I have there's no way I
have two products from Made Simple
skincare this is the face toner in Rose
grapefruit and I smell the rose a little
bit but it's just not my favorite scent
and right now I'm really into face
misters and the scent is like super
important to me so I'm gonna pass this
one on I wish it was just lavender or
just rose maybe you're just grapefruit
it's just not my favorite my mom will
love it and then I'm also getting rid of
the tooth and gum tonic I think this is
nice and I have a whole video on these
products if you really want to know more
about made simple skincare I just I was
using this and trying to make this a
part of my routine and it's just hard
because it's an oil I just don't like
oils they don't like oils in my mouth I
don't like oils on my skin it's just
hard for me so I'm going to be passing
these on my mom again she loves the she
loves this and I'm sure she'll love this
she says that the face wash that I like
did not like it all is the best face
wash she's ever used in her life so just
because I don't like something
definitely doesn't mean that it's
everyone's it's just my preference I
know that goes without saying but you
know and then last for the bag this is
the doctor gold fat and md's doctors
scrub this is a very intense like mini
scrub I don't know how to explain it
has like little granules in it you can
add this to your face wash or you can do
it alone for something really really
intense I've had this for a very long
time and this would have already lasted
me like a good at least year if I use
this consistently and I don't I don't
use it consistently I never use it I
don't like the packaging it's not easy
to use I can't just put this in the
shower yeah I'm getting rid of it yeah I
don't care that it's a hundred dollar
product and the last thing with this
power sculpt art will gel from color
proof again I just don't need this and I
don't want it that's like the biggest
thing we're getting close guys we only
have a lot of stuff left this is a lot
more of like body and hair care I was
going through my bathroom and I just was
like trying to be really realistic
find that I built through a lot of stuff
you guys see my empties videos you know
that I use a lot of products up so if
there's something that's been holding on
in my collection when it comes to like
bath and body and hair stuff there's
probably a reason for it it's either
that it's a backup so I've had a lot of
them because I know I love it or I just
don't use it so this I'm getting rid of
this is the shaping mousse and I got
this epic lots for a dollar fifty and it
sucks and I never don't I don't suggest
it spend and just do not get this one
don't get it it sucks Sam and I both
hate that this is a shampoo and
conditioner I absolutely loathe this is
from Redken and it's the clean maniac
micellar water shampoo conditioner so I
was like all about this I was so excited
to try it because I love my seller
waters and I have like fine thin hair
and I really want stuff to like really
deep clean it because it gets greasy and
I use a lot of dry shampoo and I just
need to get that product out this stuff
sucks
this sucks and just likes tricks your
hair and it doesn't feel good at all it
feels like mm-hmm
this feels like you have a I can't even
tell you what this feels like because
it's inappropriate but this feels like
you have stuff that you don't want in
your hair in your hair and it's gross
and I hate it so much I need it Oh
friggin but it's the worst it's like
this slimy texture but also gritty and
like you can't get it down once you do
it's like just like stick drive straight
and gross oh and then this doesn't
really help at all I don't even the
worst purchases I really hate that stuff
this is an older item from nuuma it's
the new volume blowout mist I've had
this for a long time since I worked in
that beauty store and basically anything
that I got from that beauty store if I'm
not like literally currently using it up
it needs to go it's just too old it's
been three years that's a long time
either if it's still good honestly then
I can pass it on but like three years
and you haven't used it haven't touched
it don't have any desire to use it it
needs to go so I'm getting rid of that
more than anything it's like just I
don't need this in my life I don't even
want the reminder of it I'm getting rid
of some deodorants I've decided that the
healthy deodorant from la vanilla is
just not
for me I did have this in my project use
it up and I'm just deciding to get rid
of it you guys in the comments were
saying just get rid of it and you're
right
these ones are brand new and open so I'm
going to pass this on to my mom this one
I'm just going to throw away because
it's like tainted from my armpit that
deodorant personally doesn't work for me
but I know that it does work for a lot
of people so I don't know look up some
reviews mine is that doesn't work I have
some hair dyes and I'm just gonna give
these to my mom because I don't dye my
hair like this anymore these two colors
I just don't want to use they're from
ion and they're the color brilliance in
mint and I believe lavender I also have
a color brilliance in hobby pink which
is what I used to use and now lately me
and my mom have been using this one from
from Fran means II yeah from musi in the
fram color bold pink just pink so anyway
she's the only one that uses this type
of diet a diamond hair so I'm gonna give
them back to her and we can use up these
two Pink's and she can use these mints
on other people or whatnot getting rid
of those
I have some dry shampoos that just don't
work this is the Herbal Essence naked
dry shampoo sucks doesn't work do not
pay for it this one is from Bosley again
I got this for free at my old job so
it's too old I also tried using it again
today my memory of it was that it sucked
and yeah it sucks it's not gonna leave a
white cast neither of these are gonna
leave a white cast well this one might
but this doesn't leave a white cast it
just doesn't but it doesn't do anything
it doesn't make your hair less greasy so
you're just it's just horrible horrible
horrible hate then yes last you hair
products this is bumble and bumble
styling lotion I got this from a friend
don't ever use it we did use it because
we ran out of the mousse and I was like
maybe this will give us some volume nah
dawg it just no not my favorite and then
this is the bedhead sugar dust this is
very similar to the puff me volumizing
powder or the powder play I believe it's
called from big sexy hair but I have so
many of those and I never use this and
this is just old and I've just seen it
around I never want to use this up I
always reach for other things I
purchased a million puff Me's over using
this even though I've had it that whole
time so that tells me I have two
sunscreens they're both from copper tone
and they're both for kids I believe my
mom somehow gave
these when she was here a while ago this
one is expired expired this month of
2018 and this one expires in April of
2018 so it's how I said the second
February 2018 April 2018 anyway I'm
gonna throw this one away and then I'm
gonna give this one of my mom hopefully
she can use it up I just prefer a spray
bottle for my sunscreen last I have some
bath and Bodyworks stuff that I'm
getting rid of this is the beautiful day
spray body mist I don't like the smell
of this I've tested it out and was like
I would not like to use that up and
because they don't like the smell of
that I thought I would get rid of the
anti pack that matches that scent I'm
also getting rid of this hand sanitizer
called no place like gnome it's apple
wreath but it's apple with some cinnamon
and it's just holiday smelling and it
just takes me way too long to get
through these so I'm gonna just pass
these on I think they're fine still I
just I want to get them I just know
they're old I know they're so old and
last let's just end it with these scent
portables or whatever they're called I
believe both of these are in the island
margarita scent although one of them is
missing the tag just not a scent for me
I'm not an island margarita girl I'm
more of a pina colada
so those are all the things I'm getting
rid of a lot of stuff um just you guys
know I don't sell any of my stuff I
don't think that you would necessarily
want any of this but I like to pass my
stuff on to like friends and family and
whatnot so yeah thank you so so much for
watching I really hope you enjoyed the
video and I will see you in the next one
