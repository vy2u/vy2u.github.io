Lorne thank you so much for watching
this is going to be a disappointing
products video I did one of these about
three or four months ago but it was more
like a product I regret buying to lose
mostly stuff that I had purchased myself
and the reason this is not titled that
is because about half of these products
were actually sent to me so I did not
purchase them I don't want a gratifying
them they just kind of disappointed me
or didn't work out for me for one reason
or another I always like to keep it real
with you guys let you guys know how I
feel about products and I personally
love watching these videos I know so
many of you do so I'm going to stop with
the disclaimer now and we're just going
to get into these products and why they
just disappointed me the first product
are kind of a set and I'm kind of sad
about this because I was really hyped up
I was so excited to try this product out
this is from pure and it's the bear doll
foundation and porcelain I didn't whole
first impressions on this if you want to
check it out I will leave it link down
below so many people were talking about
how this is so great Taylor from Tayla I
think that's how you say it she does
like foundation reviews all the time and
she really loves this foundation so I
was so excited to try it she kept
mentioning how it smelt really good and
so when this came up on oculi I was like
please let me try it out I talked about
it in that video but I just don't really
like the packaging of this I haven't
even used it that much and it's already
starting to fray here it's just the
cheapest tube I've ever felt and I
didn't like that at all this is a kind
of an expensive foundation I believe
it's in the like right at almost $40 so
I don't understand that
besides the cheap cheap packaging when
it comes to products this is just not a
consistency that I'm into it's quite
thick and it just feels heavy on the
skin this is not a bear at all you are
not bearing anything if you're wearing
this this has pretty good coverage so
that's something you're looking for if
you like a really thick heavy matte
finish you might like this I know again
a lot of people do but for what I like
this is just so heavy it's so like
sticky I just could not get it to work
for me in that video I kind of I mean it
was the first impression so I tried it I
did
I don't think I really loved it but some
more I try to make this work for me it's
just not something that I prefer on my
skin and so it just was disappointing to
me I wanted it to be just so much better
and then with that foundation they also
sent over this brush this is the pure I
don't know it's kind of like the Artie
Sobel brushes it's super soft and I
don't think it's anything against this
brush per se but these are just not my
favorite brushes to apply product with
yes I think that because these are so
dense they're just hard to clean like
just nothing about this is my favorite
I'm going to keep it because I'm hoping
one day it'll just like click and I'll
love it or something will happen maybe I
can apply a skin care with this instead
I don't know but it's just definitely
not a brush that I think it's practical
I know so many people love the artis
brushes so maybe them is just something
about those high-end brushes that are so
different than the knockoffs but I just
don't think that they're worth the money
and yeah it just doesn't work for me
it's so soft it's a nice quality but
just the shape of it it's just the brush
itself it doesn't work for me and I I'm
just pointed by it I want to like it but
I don't it's just even hard to get it
off like oh just not my foundation
preference at all I'm going to talk
about the other pure product I have just
to get it out of the way I don't even
have it any longer because I did get rid
of it but this is like it's under eye
it's like a thunder eye hydrating kind
of like primer I will have a picture of
it up on the screen here and I used it
in that same video and I I really was
excited for this product too I know it's
kind of a weird one but I thought this
would be so cool to have a product that
preps the under eye area kind of gets it
ready for concealer I'm kind of hydrates
the area maybe stops it from creasing I
don't know I just think there's some
really cool things that could happen
with this product and when I use it it
just wasn't really hydrating and then I
found too that the more I used it you
could see you could tell when I applied
product on top of it where that's like
priming products stopped and where it
wasn't any more on my under eye I hope
that makes sense but there was
definitely a line of demarcation between
that and that just not
that's not we want it just was not
working product for me so I just that
was this pointing as well now don't get
me wrong well I don't think all appears
products are bad I really love the
joystick from them which is a stick like
cleanser toner and exfoliator all-in-one
it seems feel icky but it is awesome and
I love it and I already went through it
so it's not everything it's just those
two things nah man I didn't mind them
well keeps talking about complexion
products the next one is from Kat Von D
and this is the locket setting powder
now as you can tell there's barely any
of this left because I was using it for
a while I feel like I have more of a
love-hate relationship with this I used
this to bake and I just felt like I
could never tell what this was going to
do on my skin when I would bake with it
it would just clump up a lot of the
times and look patchy I don't know if it
was the moisture from my sponge or what
but it just didn't cover evenly it just
no it's not my favorite I just think
this is not a finely milled powder this
is just a thicker powder than a lot of
those really really fine
setting powders personally I just don't
think it's worth it it is part of the
Lockett line which is a definitely like
heavy duty foundation and like coverage
line that's what it's about so maybe
that's part of it but but sighs just fit
being a heavy powder it just didn't even
perform nicely on the skin it didn't
make my skin look especially flawless
again with that patchiness and it does
have a bit of shimmer in it and glimmer
so that also is kind of weird too so it
should not my favorite product I would
definitely not repurchase this this is
just definitely not something I
recommend and I did get this through
influencer it's just not going to read I
really like it now along with that and
again from influencer is another one of
the Kat Von D locket concealing
concealers this is one that is in my
personal collection and this seems like
it's going to be so nice and I love the
way it looks but on me personally it
just creases and it doesn't look good
it's just definitely not my favorite
concealer I definitely prefer the NARS
over this
I love the Maybelline fit me which is
like way cheaper and just amazing but
this
one that I know a lot of people do like
and it could work on different people
with different like eye creases and
different skin types but this was just
not not really the best either
definitely disappointing for how much I
wanted to like it another concealer that
I have this is when I bought myself from
bareMinerals and this is the bare skin
complete coverage serum concealer I have
it in the shade fair and I was so
excited for this I used to sell these
all the time in my old work and I wanted
it to work out so well but the
consistency of this for what I'm used to
it's so so thin and it's very like
moisturizing so someone's dry under eyes
this might look amazing but I find that
although it's been and kind of more
moisturizing it just ends up going into
the cracks and even on my hand sometimes
it'll just accentuate everything just
you don't want to situate it I just was
not a fan I was not a fan I know
Stephanie from the daisy girly though
really does like this so it's definitely
not necessarily bad it just does not
work for me and I'm sad about it yeah I
just don't like it I don't like it
sometimes you just want to make products
work you like nowhere if I try this way
or what if I try the wave it sometimes
it's just like it's okay we're just not
friends maybe in another life oh wow I
have another concealer I totally didn't
realize this is another one that I
bought this is from Physicians Formula
and it's the instant ready full coverage
concealer I want to try this out because
I've heard so much about the mac
prolongwear and this is supposed to be
kind of like a dupe it's already in like
the same packaging like I just wanted it
plus I think there was like a deal on
CVS or something first off I don't even
know how this happened because I
seriously used it only a couple times
because I don't even like it but this
cap on this just totally comes up it's
not even like a screw top it's just kind
of like a plug and it's kind of cockeyed
like do you see that it looks like it's
broken I don't even know what that's
about you would want to travel with that
I don't know if I just got to dripped
out one or Zweifel anyway so now I'm
just frustrating and irritating for
packaging another issue with packaging
when you pump this out
this is one pump which seems like oh
it's just like a little dot but this is
very very full coverage you do not need
this you maybe need half of a
this is the fair shade and it's super
pink toned and I just felt like it
looked weird under my eye again it just
not a good concealer for what I'm
looking for under my eyes the Maybelline
fit me is just the best I don't know why
I even get other concealers honestly and
the prices is so much better than this
this is like I want to say 10 to 12
dollars something in that range and if
it works for you it's a lot of product
and it might be great but this is just
sucky definitely not my style the color
the packaging just everything and then
the price is like please tell me I can't
wait from a time with that my last time
is like complexion and based product
this is from kiss New York and this is
the pro touch liquid cushion foundation
now I don't think that the product and
this is bad I actually do kind of like
it it gives a very very light coverage
it's kind of this balmy consistency but
I just don't feel like it's a cushion
foundation formulation to be inside this
packaging I think they were just kind of
trying to get on that cushion trend and
I just don't like the consistency so
this is what it looks like I have a
video testing this out if you want to
try that out but it's so thick it's
crazy how thick this product is it's
like as thick as the pure ones
essentially but this is more of like a
moisturizer consistency so it doesn't
feel as heavy personally I just don't
like the packaging on this I wish they
just did a pump or even a jar or just
something else and I think it would be
so much better because again the product
itself is beautiful I actually really
like it I just think that this packaging
is such a fail and it just definitely
deters me from using it it's hard to get
the product out like no it just could be
so much better and it's not so it's
disappointing
another Physicians Formula products that
I have here is the bronze booster now
please don't kill me I know this is some
people's favorite the reason that this
doesn't work for me is because it's just
too dark I feel like I can't just kind
of blend it on my skin I have to work a
lot harder with this product to make
sure that it doesn't look super patchy
and just like you know blotchy
especially on my forehead which I
already just have issues on myself so I
definitely don't need a product that's
going to make things worse for me the
reason I bought this product is because
they did not have the butter bronzer
which is like my absolute favorite so I
thought I'll get this it's on clearance
but it just doesn't work for my skin
tone so it's not necessarily a bad
product just skin tone wise it just
don't work for me
next is the Rimmel product this is the
brow this way brow styling gel from
Rimmel I'm really into brow gel lately I
think that they just look so nice I
really like that pushed up brow look I'm
really into it so I have the Maybelline
one I do really like that one I have one
from Lancome I really like that one I
have a new one coming from black up I'm
so excited for it just clear but
hopefully it'll be really good and I had
high hopes for this it was cheap I
thought would be so great if something
under $5 worked this is what this bully
looks like so it's just kind of this
middle grade it's not small but it's not
like massive but it's just subpar to me
color wise it's okay it kind of has a
bit of a green shell at least on my skin
so it's not my favorite I find I can
never get the right amount of product so
I just wish that this spoolie was just
smaller it's just not very good I
suggest the Enabling one have like
fibers in it and I think it's just
something kind of unique I just enjoy
that one more so I just regret
purchasing this five dollars I could
have in my wallet and last I have two
colourpop lip products these are some
glosses that I bought and was in curvy
and the other ones investing now I love
the gloss that I'm wearing now which is
in Finders Keepers
it's then the dope it's really nice like
everything about it I really like so I
purchased these hoping they'd be the
same and they are not the formulas are
the same these are a lot more sticky
those dough foot is bigger just it's a
thicker consistency just nothing about
these is the same I feel so do these are
swatches of the product so it's the
colors are fine and I find that they do
tend to kind of like it in the creases a
little bit they're just not as nice I
would totally believe that these are
100% different formulas easy pretty sure
they are yeah and it's kind of sad I
wish they weren't so that kind of turned
me off like first I was just like I
don't really care about color pop then I
got that free one finders keepers and
was so excited and was excited to buy
them and then I got these and I'm turned
off I don't know kind of all over the
place when it comes to colour-pop lippie
but at this point I'm not sure if I'm
gonna buy
lipglosses because there is not worth
six dollars for just kind of like
e-products when I don't need more lip
products that much that is everything
guys I hope you enjoyed this video these
are just some products that I had high
hopes for and they didn't work out for
me or they didn't work out for my skin
tone on my skin type or whatever the
case may be let me know if you've tried
any of these products down below they
worked for you if they didn't or what
some of your disappointing products are
I will see you my next video thank you
so much for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
