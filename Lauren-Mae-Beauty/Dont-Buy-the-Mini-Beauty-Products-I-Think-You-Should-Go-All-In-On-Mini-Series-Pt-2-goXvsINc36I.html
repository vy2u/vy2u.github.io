Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be going in to part
two of my mini series and these are
gonna be all the minis that I don't
think you should buy things that are in
small form that I think in small form oh
my gosh my voice is cracking so much
that I think are worth it to splurge try
the big size see if you like it because
it just makes more sense product wise a
lot of these products are things you're
gonna maybe go through a little bit
faster than let's say a highlighter or a
blush or something like that so I
thought this would just be a nice
contrast to the first video in the
series so let's get into the items that
I don't think you should buy a mini said
I think you should buy in the full-size
and just go for it try it out see if you
want it so the first item on the list is
the NARS radiant creamy concealer now I
didn't really realize that you could buy
this in a mini sized but you can it cost
$13 it has point zero five ounces in it
and to me a concealer is something you
use every single day a lot of us use a
lot of it you can use it to touch up and
bring it with you and I get that having
a small size of something is nice to
throw in your bag but I don't think a
concealer is that big the regular sized
concealer is not that big you can easily
throw that in your bag it's just as big
as a lipgloss so I don't understand why
you'd want the travel size their full
size retails for thirty dollars so you
are saving a little over half if you buy
the small size but in the full size
you're getting point twenty two ounces
of product so you're getting four times
as much product in in the full-size so I
just think this is one that you're gonna
be using all the time just go for the
big one because so many places that sell
NARS have a great return policy unless
you're out of the United States I know
some other countries don't have the same
return policies but here in the US if
you don't like that concealer it doesn't
work out for you you can go and return
it so I think that you should get the
better bang for your buck and kind of
risk it because it is like a fan
favorite concealer and if you really
hate it you have options of returning it
instead of buying barely any product for
still quite a bit of money
the next product that I don't think you
should get the mini on I actually did
buy the minis of I have a full size as
well but these are the Stila glitter and
glows they have a kit right now online
that was out for holiday but it's still
available and it has three diff
of these see love letters and I bought
that kit and this is it so they're very
tiny and you get three different colors
and most of the time I would be like hey
that's so awesome you get to try out
three different colors for $25 that's
amazing but the thing is these are all
very very similar glitters and this
Stila glittery was i think they're
really cool innovative products I think
they're fun but these are not different
enough on the eye that I think that you
should just pick the color that you like
and just get that one because that's
what I've noticed is like I basically
always want to use this one which i
think is kitten karma and the other two
although they're pretty they aren't
quite the tone that fits my skin tone or
they're just not my preference and
they're not different enough from this
though to be that different of an eye
look so I think that you should find the
color that you really like and just
invest in that one not everyone that
loves to wear glitter all the time I get
that some people do and maybe having
multiples and minis and every single
color is worth it for you but if you're
not someone who's like that I think you
should pick the one glitter that really
fits you
suits you that you know you're gonna
wear a lot and just get that one the
full size of these retail for $24 so
you're saving technically a dollar and
you won't have a bunch of minis I feel
like these might dry it out a little bit
easier as well because they are so small
so kind of a different one for me since
I did buy it but I just feel like you
might as well pick the color you want
you're stuck to these neutral ones in
the range if you pick up the minis
whereas you can pick any of the full
size and maybe you want a purple glitter
or something a little bit different and
that'll suit you better than these ones
so I think that you should just buy a
full size of the one you want instead of
getting these three next is a mini from
a brand that you guys know I love this
is from Sol de Janeiro and I'm talking
about the mini boom-boom cream again I
have the full size and the small one to
compare but this is the small size of
the boom-boom cream this has let's see
2.5 fluid ounces a product in it so it's
not a lot of product and I get that this
would be great for travel or something
like that but if you're just trying to
try out this product because you want to
know if it works I just suggest getting
the big one this has eight
point one fluid ounces of product in it
so you're getting over three times as
much in here this retails for forty five
dollars in this retails for twenty so I
just think that if you like the smell of
this go into sephora smell it make sure
you like it because it is a distinct
smell
most people love it and it's amazing but
if you don't then you already know this
is off your list but if you do like this
melt and you want to try this out I
think for the entire body and to get
enough wear out of it to see if you
really like it I just think you should
invest in the big one I know it's
expensive it doesn't matter which one
you get these are both going to be
expensive but I just think you should go
for it and get the big one I'm have
enough to actually use on your body and
use on your legs and you know use freely
to see how much you like it instead of
just getting this small and and really
like savoring it and still spending
twenty dollars on it so this one I think
you should skip the mini and I think you
should get the big one even if you want
to travel you can put this in a smaller
container and have that savings
monetarily the next product I do not
suggest getting a mini of is something
that I bought the mini of this is the
Too Faced hangover 3 and one
replenishing primer and setting spray I
really enjoyed this product but I went
through this in about a month I would
say with pretty consistent use I really
did enjoy this product this has a one
ounce in it and you can buy this alone
for $15 which is so much freaking money
that's $15 for one ounce of product I
got this in like a bigger set it came
with like a Beauty Blender and a smaller
Beauty Blender and I think maybe one of
the thing or maybe it was just this
actually but anyway it came in a set so
that's why I tried it out but I would
not purchase this in the small size and
I don't suggest it because of how fast I
went through it I think that if you were
wanting to try this product just go for
the big size the large one comes away
that 3.4 fluid ounces of product in it
and it retails for $32 so I mean you
might as well just double your money and
get over double the amount of product
almost four times the amount of product
so I don't suggest getting the mini just
just go for it again return policies are
so good guys I know it's like always a
give and take of like when you want more
product for less money or when it's okay
to spend less in total but not get as
much product and it's not as good of a
value price per gram or
or whatever that is always like a
decision you have to make depending on
your collection and what you want to do
but these are the things that I think
you should just like trust the return
policy get them if you were interested
in them the next product on my list is
something that I actually don't have any
of at the moment but these are the fresh
sugar lip balms now I love those lip
balms they're one of my absolute
favorite I love the original like just
you know lemon dawn tinted lip balm it's
my favorite it's one of Sam's favorites
too but do not get the Mining's guys
don't get the mini sets during the
holidays don't get the little like duo's
don't do it because these are so sucky
when it comes to packaging they break
off in the packaging it's just like a
faulty situation it's not at all I feel
like how the product performs in the
large size so I just feel like save up
get the one color you like because it's
just gonna break off the base by the
time you get to the end of that product
it is so like just mangled and mushy and
gross so that is like a packaging flaw
when it comes to the mini so don't do it
just get the full size try out the full
size unless you're gonna for free
somehow obviously then you're not paying
for it but I really don't suggest
getting those bigger sets that are like
40 something dollars for like five or
six different colors I've done that in
the past and I'm telling you it's just
really irritating once you get down to
the end how easily and how soft they are
which is amazing I love that about the
formula it just doesn't work in the
smaller packaging and being a smaller
tube of product it just can't withstand
you putting it on your lip so don't do
it guys don't do it I'm telling you
don't do it the next product that I
don't suggest the minion is the Moroccan
oil Moroccan oil treatment this is one
of my all-time favorite products I've
used this for years my mom uses this on
her clients and she actually sells this
product and it's expensive Moroccan oil
is a very expensive brand so I can see
that it would be tempting to get the
small one but I just don't think it's
worth it and I think this product is
just so good that you might as well just
get the big one have enough to actually
see how this is going to work on your
hair and have enough where you don't
feel super stingy with the product this
full-size is 3.4 fluid ounces and it
retails for $44 which again I know
it's a lot there's a lot of money but
this product honestly lasts me like a
year it lasts me so long if I use two
pumps every time I get out of the shower
with my wet hair it lasts me like a
whole year but the small size of this
retails for fifteen dollars which is a
better like more digestible amount of
money to spend but you only get point
eight five ounces of product you don't
even get a full ounce it's just such a
small amount of product and I just think
that if you were wanting to try this if
you like hair oils I think you should
just go for the big one you'll have it
forever it's a bit of an investment but
it's an amazing product it smells so so
good and you're just saving money in the
long run because of the amount of
product it's not like tons and tons but
it's definitely a lot of money because
of how expensive this product is per
ounce and because it's so good I just
think you should just go for the big one
again you can return it if you don't
like it I have two more things on my
list but I realized one of them should
have been my video yesterday so I'm
gonna leave that as like a bonus after
this one but the last mini that I don't
think that you should buy that I don't
think is worth the money is the Beauty
Blender micro mini oh my gosh I have one
to show you because I buy this kit at
IMATS when I go and it's like three
Beauty blenders and then you get a mini
and a mini cleanser and it's just such a
great deal for the three Beauty blenders
alone that I've just done like whatever
I'll get the mini but I personally do
not think that this is worth it for
eighteen dollars you get two of these
products and they do expand slightly
when you wet them and you can use them
to get into really tiny areas on the
face I know that some people love these
so if you love them and you want to say
that it's great that's awesome and I'm
really happy that you enjoy this product
to me I just think that this does what
the Beauty Blender was designed to do
the Beauty Blender has a point on it so
you can get into your under eye and you
can get into the crevices of the face I
feel like that's why this shape works so
well I don't think that this is needed
it's so tiny it's so fussy
you can't multitask this as much as this
can do and I just feel like every time I
hear people talk about how great this is
I'm like this does the same thing for me
like it still does that so this isn't
mini event for me just isn't worth the
money just buy one Beauty Blender and
you're good to go you don't need a micro
I don't suggest to my criminy they just
haven't worked out for me at all
especially for the price I just feel
like you're gonna lose them like no no
don't do it I don't suggest it I do not
suggest the menu and my bonus item for
something I do suggest a minion instead
of not because I forgot to put it on the
other one sorry guys but I do want to
mention it because I think it's a really
big one and I'm kind of sad I don't know
how I got mixed up and put it on this
list instead of the other list but these
are the Smashbox primers now you can get
I think almost any of the Smashbox
primers which they have so many of them
in a small form and in the mini they are
point five ounces for sixteen dollars
which you know isn't a lot of product
usually you get at least an ounce but if
you get the full size you get one ounce
for $36 now you know take a second do
that math if you bought two of the small
products you would get the same amount
of ounces you would get to half ounce
products which equals one ounce for $30
and if you bought just the full-sized
straight out you get one ounce for $36
so you're spending six more dollars to
get the same amount of product in one
packaging instead of two so this is one
I say get the mini try the mini out
especially if you have other products I
get that it can be irritating maybe you
want the full size maybe it's worth the
$6 whatever but honestly if I'm being
straight up this is kind of like pisses
me off because usually it's the opposite
way the mini is more convenient and you
get less product and it's going to be a
worse deal for you than if you were to
spend more money and get the full-sized
product that's how many's work for the
most part this is doing the opposite
thing you're you're losing out because
you aren't buying the mini and I just
think that that's like a really I don't
know like I just I think it's wrong it's
kind of like duping the customer you
would think like oh I'll just get the
full size I know I love it I'd rather
save money but in the long run you
aren't you're literally spending more
money to get that full size product so
yeah I really wish I could have added it
into the other video because I think
it's like a really important one and
it's something a little bit different
than the reasons why I suggest the minis
on the other one this one literally just
makes more sense to get the small size
because you will be
money in the long run alright guys well
that is everything for the minis that I
don't suggest you buy if you have any
minis that you don't think are worth it
let us know down in the comments so we
can stay away if you've tried any of
this stuff and you have some reviews
definitely leave those down below - I
love when we can all kind of get
different opinions from each other
because all of us have tried different
makeup and as much as I make videos I
have not tried everything guys like it's
not possible and that is everything
thank you so much for watching we're
gonna finish up this mini-series
tomorrow
with mini reviews and it's going to be a
bunch of many reviews on many little
products how cute is that
anyway that's everything thank you so
much for watching guys and I will see
