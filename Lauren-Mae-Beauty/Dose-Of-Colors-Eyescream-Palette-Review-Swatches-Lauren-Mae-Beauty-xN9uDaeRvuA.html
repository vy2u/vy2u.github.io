Lauren for this video I'm going to be
giving guys a review of my dose of
colors ice cream palette I bought this
actually in store but you can get this
online at dose of colors website I will
leave it linked down below if you guys
actually want to get this by the end of
the video but I wanted to do a more
in-depth review than I have on the last
two pallets that I did like swatch
videos for I really wanted to get those
videos just up so you guys could make
your own decisions on it but since I've
had more time to play around with this I
thought I would tell you my experiences
with it how I feel about the palette and
swatch it for you guys so you guys can
decide if you wanted I know that there's
a lot of hype around this palette
especially like on Instagram
specifically yeah so I was hoping I
could give you more clarity if you think
you might like this first off let's talk
about packaging I hope that it's not too
blown out but the packaging is
absolutely adorable so it comes in a
sleeve so this is like an outer sleeve
kind of like how the bomb does their
packaging and then this is what the
palette itself looks like so it's a
little bit different than the outside
we're packaging it is in a cardboard
packaging it's really slick in tiny I
enjoy cardboard packaging I think it's
really nice I don't think that there's
an issue with it being sturdy or
anything it feels nice I feel like my
shadows are safe and personally I like
cardboard because it's cheaper to make
than like a plastic pallet and I hope
that in turn they're passing the savings
on to me as a consumer so I like that
about it I love the lorac palettes I
loved kat von d palette just anything
with that cardboard packaging anyway on
top of that it's super cute look at all
these ice cream cones
I really like the whole theme about this
palette when you open it inside sorry to
blind you with my dirty a mirror but it
does have a mirror in it I just wanted
to show you guys that and it has like a
really pretty like pink and white
striped pattern and then these are the
shadows you do get 10 shadows and this
palette cost $50 I think that's a really
reasonable price it's 5 dollars a shadow
as a whole again I really like the color
selection I like that you get a variety
of mattes and
shimmers a variety of neutral colors and
like pops of color I think it's well
thought out for how you would do I looks
and how you would use these colors so in
all that and overall I really do enjoy
this palette and I do suggest it but I
do want to go through each color and
just talk about it because I have used
every color in here and I thought it
would just give you a little more
insight on the colors so the first one
here is berries and cream and this is a
matte shade I really like this color I
love using this all over the lid from
the lashes to the brow bone and I think
it works really well to me that's like a
must have in every palette so I am so
glad that's included in this one the
next color is mint chip it's a really
nice shimmery mint color I think it's
really nice and pigmented super nice and
soft I really like that color
the next color sherbert is probably my
favorite shimmery color in the palette
it's a copper color but it has this tiny
tiny bit of like a rose undertone that I
really enjoy I do like to pack this
color on with my finger onto the lid
just I feel like it gives the best
payoff it's just so pretty
I'm just so obsessed with it I think
it's just a really pretty color it's one
that I gravitate to a lot in this
palette and it's just one of the top
shades for me in this palette the next
color is the color cone and it's my
hands-down favorite color I love it I
wish I had it in a single oh it's so
pretty
there's something about this one as well
that's a brown and neutral but it also
has that rosy tone underneath it I do
feel like there are comparable colors to
this in the lorac mega pro 3 so if you
already bought that and these are the
two colors you want because I'm talking
about them I feel like you could
definitely do a look that similar I just
love it I love this color so much I like
just putting that just that in the
crease for a really simple I like lots
of lashes the matte cream shade on the
lid boom I feel like I look really cute
it's easy I look put together I really
love it
next is hot fudge this is a matte color
it's beautiful it blends well it's dark
I don't use a ton of really dark colors
but I'm really glad it's included in
here to just give the palette some depth
when you need to the next color banana
split is a golden shimmery shade this
one is when you swatch it it's a little
powdery and it almost seems like it's
gonna be flaky but it's really smooth
and it goes on really well I like using
on the inner corner or as a lint shade
next is blueberry swirl this is a matte
shade and again I love this color I'm
wearing that color as well as Cohen on
the lid today and that's really it so
pretty again one of my top colors in
here I just I love it it's so so
beautiful I love it it's a berry color
but it's not too dark these two shades
I'm telling you they win my heart and
then this one together like all three of
those so beautiful have a look yeah I
highly suggest the shade as well the
next one bubblegum is my least favorite
in the palette it's a shimmery pink
color and it does have a glitter in it I
thought when I first got it that it's
like oh it's not glitter it's just like
a really intense shimmer but it's
definitely glitter it definitely falls
out I highly suggest putting it on your
lid before you do the rest of your
makeup so you can clean up any fallout
it's pigmented but then at the same time
I'm just I'm just not as impressed with
it it feels soft I'm not saying it's a
bad shade I'm just not as in love with
it as I thought it would be and I really
wish it didn't have the glitter glitter
in it just the one time I wore it I just
wasn't I just wasn't feeling it so I
don't think I'm gonna get a ton of use
out of that color but it does perform
nicely and I think other people would
like it it's just definitely not my cup
of tea and it's pink I'm kind of sad
that it's not the next color is lavender
honey this is a matte shade and it's
like a pastel lavender color this shade
is probably the one I feel like that
sells the palette for people I feel like
a pastel light lavender purple color is
not easy to come by it's not often that
you come by it so I feel like it really
does make this palette more unique I
don't think that this color swatch is
very well but you definitely can build
it up something I noticed when I use
this is that it seems like it's gonna be
so light in the pan and give you a
really pastel look but it definitely
goes on more pigmented and kind of
darker than what you expect or at least
what I expected so I did like it it just
was like a different change for me I
tried using this on the inner corner as
well and it just made my eyes a little
too dark for what I was expecting and
wanting so I think it performs really
well especially for it being a pastel
shade and something I feel like that's a
little bit harder but that's just
something to keep in mind I feel like it
does translate a little bit deeper on
the eyes and the last color we're almost
there
this
color is double-scoop and it is a
shimmering dark brown color I'm glad
that they have this in the palette again
I was like depth and warmth it's very
pretty
it doesn't have that glitter that
bubblegum does so I do enjoy that color
and I think it's just a nice grounding
color for the rest of the palette
something I want to mention is formula
the matte shades in here are definitely
really nice and blendable I feel like
they're a mix between makeup geek
shadows and matte shadows so they do
have a little bit of powder kick up but
not nearly as much as makeup geek and
more than Mac so if that gives you a
little bit of an idea of the texture of
it I kind of like that and like that
I can kind of throw my brush in there a
little bit more and it's not just like
powder everywhere but I also know that
there's product on my brush for the
shimmer shades I feel like for the most
part they're all the same formula I
think they're really nice they're
definitely not like highly metallic or
something really insane like liquid
metal or something but I do think that
they're really nice and good quality but
if you're looking for something that's
just like mind-blowing I don't think
that that's those colors not the
shimmers in here overall I really do
like this palette I'm happy to have it
in my collection I'm definitely enjoying
it I don't think that it's the best
palette ever in life what really excites
me about this is just the color
combination and the inspiration I find
with these colors being put in here I
really do think these have a good
formula is it the most amazing formula
I've ever watched in an eyeshadow
definitely not but I definitely think
it's still good I think it's worth the
$50 I definitely think it comes off as
like a high-end product so I do suggest
it but if you're not someone who uses a
lot of color I don't think this is a
must-have for you yeah I don't know I'm
happy with it but I can see other people
not liking it or not using it as much as
they should so that's kind of my review
I feel like I may be sound not as
excited about it as I am but I just want
to be real with you guys and I like it
but I don't know if everyone would and I
can understand what other people
wouldn't I really just love the maps I
wish they come out with like an all
matte palette but with the shimmer
shades I just feel like they're they're
nice colors I like them but they're just
not they're not the best of their kind
that I have in my collection anyway
that was helpful I hope that helps you
decide if you want this palette or not
and I will see you guys in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
