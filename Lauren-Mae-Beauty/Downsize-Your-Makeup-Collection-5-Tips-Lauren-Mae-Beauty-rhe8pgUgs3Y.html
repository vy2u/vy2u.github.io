Lauren this is going to be a little bit
of a different video but I thought I
would go over my top 5 ways that I found
that have helped me declutter and
downsize my collection these are just
ways that I found that have really
stopped the flow of makeup into my
collection that have made me think about
purchases before I went and bought them
and have just really helped me along the
path to decluttering and to downsizing
my collection and just really making
sure that I love everything that I own
instead of just having a million things
because everyone said they're amazing I
know other people have done these in the
past I'm not saying these are new
thoughts or anything but I just thought
since I've been on YouTube about a year
now which is crazy and have been on my
project panning path these are just
things that I thought I would just I
would know myself what are you guys so
the first thing that I think helps like
insanely to stop clutter from coming
into your collection to help you
downsize your collection and really
focus on the products you already have
is to stop all your subscription boxes
so that means if see Birchbox I don't
even know all the boxes are so many
boxes target has one long Mart has one
Sephora has one literally everyone has a
makeup box now if you like them that's
great there's nothing wrong with them I
just think I really like the idea of
subscription bags and boxes I think
they're really fun but as I've been
trying to declutter I realize that in my
head $10 seems like nothing but when you
have three boxes going that's $30 a
month or you could buy yourself one
really nice item instead of getting five
sample size items in each bag and if
you're really trying to lower your
numbers and you're really trying to just
have a more manageable collection I feel
like that's one really easy way to one
save money but to to stop all those
little things from coming into your
collection and cluttering up your
collection and just being there that's
just how I feel about it I sense you're
not picking these items you don't even
have an attachment so I just feel like
getting a bunch of little items you
don't necessarily care about sometimes
you get lucky and you really wanted to
try something but for all the things
that you didn't and you just got sent
there just adding to the products in
your collection that you're just feeling
so so about and iffy about when you
declutter them or when
get rid of them and you're like oh I
didn't really buy that like you did buy
that you spent $10 on that bag that's my
first suggestion cuz it just completely
cuts it off like immediately so you're
not just being automatically sent stuff
to your house every single month you're
stopping right there already like
potentially five items per bag from
getting it to your house
the next suggestion I have if you're
really wanting to downsize your
collection is to project pan project
pans worked really well for me because
I'm a really focused urban person so if
I have a goal I'm like ready to hit that
goal let's do it
especially with seasonal project pans
because there's like you know finished
five bikes and go to my oh by the 5th of
May there's already a deadline set you
want to try to finish these products it
just helps you to remember to use those
products more than you would have if you
didn't set that goal although not every
single project pan is successful and not
every product gets finished we do our
best and I also think that without doing
a project pan you probably wouldn't have
touched that item at all even if you
used it 10 15 20 more times and you
would have that is a success you are
using that product you're getting more
of your money's worth out of that
product you're finding out if you like
this product to repurchase or if you
wanted to clutter it and that's helping
you so I really think project panning is
a great way to downsize and your items
out as well as come to really solid
opinions on products really finding out
your makeup preferences and just getting
to know your collection more yourself
more and becoming a better shopper too
in the future number three
stop watching hauls it's so hard
sometimes I'm just in the mood and I
want to watch a ton of hauls but
whenever I do watch holes I naturally
just become excited to buy stuff and go
check out websites and want to go
shopping and all that so if you're
really wanting to focus in on not buying
stuff i really suggest just you know
opting out of the new spring haul opting
out of a new Sephora haul that just
popped up on your channel it's really
just gonna trigger you to buy stuff and
that's not necessarily what you need i
mean it's pretty simple i know it's hard
but you can either unsubscribe or just
have the willpower not to click on those
videos because once you see a product i
know a lot of us are like that once you
see that product it's like this
impulsive thing and you want to just go
buy it right then if you didn't watch
that haul in the first place you
probably wouldn't even
the thought or even know about that
product to buy number four I think it's
really important that if you want to buy
something and you're really excited to
buy something that you one really think
long and hard about it don't make an
impulse buy don't go buy it immediately
but instead think about that purchase
and then go to your collection so I
talked about this before but I've wanted
different palettes and different blushes
and different things in the past and
I've thought about them went to my
collection started swatching around in
my collection and just realise that it's
gonna be basically the same or very
similar to things that I already have in
my collection and these things that I
have that are similar haven't gotten any
use so I really think it's important
when you really get the itch to buy
something which it's not bad to buy
something sometimes but when you want to
try to downsize and you want to try to
eliminate unnecessary and frivolous
purchases from your life to look at what
you already have and become excited
about the collection you have really
become fulfilled in what you already
have and feel just content with what you
have I feel like if you take that like
step back in that second of reflection
you are likely to eliminate a lot of
unnecessary purchases from your life and
I just think that that one's really
helped me personally so just take out
your collection see if you have
something similar if you can dupe it or
maybe you'll become excited about
something that you already have that's
similar or maybe you'll just be like
holy crap I haven't used 60 of my
blushes and I'm gonna go buy a pallet
full of you know six more no way I'm
gonna look at these my last tip for
downsizing your collection and trying to
stay on track with not purchasing and
just not becoming a makeup addict would
be to talk to your significant other or
just someone else about the purchases
you want to make because as people in
the beauty community and people who
watch YouTube or even create YouTube
content for beauty channels we are all
sucked into this whole world and we
forget that there are normal people out
there who don't give they don't give an
F like they don't care about the new
Lumi cushion foundation and they don't
even know what the heck you know benefit
you know mascara it's
is you know so talking to these people
or I really think for me personally my
significant other my husband has really
helped me kind of kind of pull me out of
the crazy whirlwind that is the new the
beauty community and all the new
purchases and the new products and the
hype and the just craziness that it is
so I really think just talking to them
and and just letting them know about
your purchases so one they're not
secretive and not like kind of a guilty
thing or like a an addict
type of behavior with buying product I
know that's weird but I think we all can
kind of understand that really helps to
downsize your collection and it just
helps again to pull you out of that
world you guys know I wanted to do this
this year and it's really been helping
me I have a list of 10 top 10 beauty
resolutions that I set for myself this
year I'll link it down below if you want
to check it out but that has really
helped me and I think it would help a
lot of you as well so I hope you guys
enjoyed my tips I think even if you just
take something from this even if it's
not every single thing I'm by no means
trying to say that buying makeup is bad
I love buying makeup still but if you're
finding that you're unhappy with how
much you're buying or you just feel like
you aren't stopping the cycle or you
just need a little reminder of you know
staying on track I just think that a lot
of us in the panning community and just
a lot of us who have watched YouTube for
a long time have gotten so sucked into
buying so many products and if you're
trying to stop that if you're really
trying to just downsize your collection
if you're trying to really have a more
minimal collection or just make sure
that you're only buying things that you
truly are gonna like and use instead of
just anything that gets a little bit of
hype here on YouTube or on Instagram
these will really help you and remind
you to just take a step back and kind of
reflect on the purchases before you make
them so that you can just get closer to
that goal whatever that goal is for you
so hope you guys enjoyed this video and
that's everything I will see you in my
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
