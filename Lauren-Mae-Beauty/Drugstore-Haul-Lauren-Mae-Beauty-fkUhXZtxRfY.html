it's Lauren I have been shopping the
drugstore a little bit lately so I do a
few things that I picked up some of it
is for future videos I'm really excited
to do and just some like different
content on my channel which is exciting
I feel like before when I used to buy a
lot of makeup I really only went for
high-end stuff especially towards the
end up like my makeup frenzy and since
I'd project panned and now I'm like
getting back into buying makeup there's
a fly I'm so sorry to see a fly I will
try to kill it throughout this video but
if it's in it I'm so sorry it just wants
to make an appearance anyway since I'm
now looking into buying more makeup and
just not constricting myself as much on
bringing things in I feel like these
higher price points that I used to add
to my cart with no problem are now like
really weird for me especially if I'm
not adding it to my kit and it's just
for my own personal use so drugstore has
really been like where it's at for me
and I'm excited to try some different
things there are so many new products
that I have never tried out that are new
to me and I'm just excited to kind of
explore so let's get into this most of
this stuff I bought the other day a
little bit of it I bought a couple days
before that let's just dive in so i
bought two maybelline products the first
one here is a staple this is the
Maybelline fit me and fair my absolute
favorite concealer from the drugstore
that I've ever tried holy grail I love
it I ever purchased this so many times I
just think it's such a great concealer
the texture the color the consistency
the way it blends on the skin everything
about it I really like and then I also
decided to try a different powder this
is the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless I don't really like the regular
fit me powder but then that one seemed
like it'd be more up my alley this is
translucent but I definitely don't feel
like it would go on translucent so if
you are darker this might give you a
white cast I like to use this under my
eyes so far as like a setting powder it
works nicely so far for that I'm still
kind of testing it out though to see how
I like it best and kind of get a feel
for it and then during that same trip I
did pick up a nail polish this is orally
which it doesn't look like normal
orderly so I don't know if that's true
but anyway orly color blast and it's in
the shade Wonder Woman it's a part of
the Wonder Woman collection this is
such a pretty glittery polish it has red
glitters and then it has like blue hex
on all I don't know that's how you'd say
that like hexagons and then in yellow
stars I thought this would just be a fun
polish I tried putting this on today no
the formula of this just got so goopy
you would think that I've had this open
for like 10 years that's how goopy it
got I only is it to paint my nails and
it's already down to here I immediately
took it off because it felt like bubbly
like it would never dry um and then even
the stars on this barely got on I
probably should have known but the
sparkle in the bottle totally got me so
I'm going to actually return this
something that I'm trying to make myself
do if I just don't feel like I love a
product it's take advantage of the fact
that a lot of these places have really
good return policies and it's okay to
use them it's okay next I was in the
mall and I wanted to go to target just
to get some eyebrow pencils and I really
like the elf one it's super inexpensive
and as I was walking in mall to target
there was an elf store if you guys
follow me on instagram you saw me post
about that so that was really awesome to
just see inside an elf store did you see
the fly I hope you guys saw the fly I
feel crazy it so it's like grossing me
out but I gotta film so I don't have
time to hunt it but I will after this
anyway enough about the damn fly it was
really awesome inside the store to see
all the elf products who could test
everything and they had everything in
stock which was awesome because I feel
like sometimes you go to Target or
anywhere that carries elf and
everything's kind of picked through and
you're lucky if you get the thing you
want now I was tempted to go crazy but I
did just get what I went in for in the
first place so i did get four of the elf
brow pencils this is in the color taupe
I already have busted this open it's
what i'm wearing on my eyebrows today
plus a little bit of powder in the tail
i just love this brow pencil especially
for the price i love that has a spoolie
the caps do not stay on so that's like a
bummer but to be two dollars you cannot
beat it i like the formula i think it
draws on the skin nice and to me it's
thin enough to do the precise or the ass
precise of brow that I like to do so I
obviously have some back
I feel like with consistent use that
brow pencil usually lasts me about like
three weeks maybe a month depending on
how much of doing my makeup or how dark
my brows are so I decided to still go
into target even though the elfster was
there just to see what there was I
picked up a few different things one
thing that I'm super excited to try is
the covergirl clean Matt BB cream and
this is for oily skin in the shade fair
I have been wanting to try some
different foundations and I've been
watching tons of different like first
impressions and reviews and where tests
and this one is one that definitely
intrigued me I am gonna do my own first
impression and we're test on this so I'm
really excited to just try doing a
different video and also to actually try
this on my skin I cannot wait I've had
it for a couple of days now and because
I haven't had the chance to film that
video I haven't tried it but I cannot
wait to see how this lasts on my skin I
really am excited about the coverage and
I really hope it works I decided to pick
up another staple item this is the
Rimmel stay matte in transparent I have
gone through a couple of these and it's
just a nice powder I'm really trying to
find my Holy Grail foundation
combination I'm excited to try different
products that actually work for my skin
and that I feel confident in so many
products I feel like lately I just get
oily by the end of the day and I'm just
done with it I don't want my product
breaking down especially like around my
nose and my chin the oil just like eats
through product and I just feel I just
feel self-conscious at the end of the
day instead of instead of nice and
beautiful so I'm really hoping that with
that powder or whatever I can kind of
handle that issue and feel good and the
last thing I got three blushes from wet
and wild these are the ombre blushes and
these are not new but they are new to me
and I've seen so many people talk about
these I've seen so many people haul them
and I'm so excited to have them in my
own collection the first one here is the
princess daiquiris this one is kind of
the most pinky out of all of them the
more Coralie one is called might I buy
you a drink and the last one that I must
have somehow put my finger in at one
point this is in a purple haze and this
is the one probably I'm most excited for
but these don't have a ton of
pigmentation so they're definitely like
a shimmery lightly pigmented blush I'm
still can
testing them out to see how much I like
them a part of me likes that they're
really sheer a part of me feels like
they should maybe have a little bit more
pigmentation so I'm gonna keep playing
around with these and see if I actually
want to keep them and if they're worth
it to me if anything I might just keep
the purple one because it is so
different but we'll see i'm still
testing and my makeup buying rampage did
not stop there so I went and I found a
Walmart in LA Walmart's are like
unicorns they are so hard to find I'm
telling you if you live like in the
suburbs or not like in more like the
city they're not as hard but if you live
in the city you have to drive to a
walmart like you really do have to seek
them out so I did this because I've been
wanting to film a video called five
first impressions and I wanted to keep
it brand focused so I was thinking about
the brand hard candy or flower beauty
those are both brands I really haven't
explored much and they are exclusive to
walmart so I which walmart they didn't
have flower beauty which is crazy
because again they're only sold at
walmart so i don't know why this walmart
is like lacking but they did have hard
candy so i picked up five products that
i wanted to do a five first impressions
on i tried to pick products that i
thought i would actually use afterward
if they were good so one of them is the
sheer envy primer this is the shine free
formula I remember using the hard candy
primer when they only had one one type
and I loved it and I felt like it really
did help keep me Matt so I'm excited to
try this out and see how it works hoping
that it keeps me really mad but yeah
it's kind of nice to just try something
new with that I did pick up a foundation
this is the hard candy glamour flage and
this is in the color porcelain I have
heard from a lot of different reviews
that I've watched on this that this is
not a good foundation just by itself but
they like to use it as a mixer so we
will see how it goes I think the shade
might be slightly too light for me but I
didn't want to get something too dark
I'd really rather be too light and I can
kind of bronze up my skin then it'd be
just like to darken it doesn't match
anything so I'm excited to try this out
see how it works on my skin this is a
highlight and contour stick this one is
in the shade light and what I was really
excited about is that the contour part
of this seems really nice and cool tone
I feel like a lot of times drugstore
contour products are a little too warm
and so
excited just to see how this works the
formula how it blends out and I don't
have any cream contouring products right
now the one thing I had is in my kit so
I don't have a ton of things in this
category last two things this is the
eyeliner and this is the liquid eyeliner
in the shade White Knight it's glitter
liner you guys know how much I love
those support litter liners so I was
really excited to see a brand other than
knicks have a glitter liner and I really
want to test it out see how it is I
think this was like six dollars which i
think is pretty reasonable so hopefully
this works out really well I got the
white shade because I thought it'd be
really pretty on the inner corner and
last I did pick up a lip gloss now I'm
not a lip person usually in general but
I was intrigued because this gloss
claims to plump the lips and I just
wanted to see if that was true if I
noticed any volumizing if it burned like
the two-faced one just kind of what it
was about I think that I might actually
put a bit of this on my hand and then go
from my hand and work on my lip so that
way i can actually add it to my kit if i
do like it so that way it doesn't become
a waste so yeah that's like my thought
on that I do have one more thing I i
guess i'll show you i did fill this
before but I just hated my hair in it so
I just refilled it I'm not gonna lie I
did I was like I want to look cute I
don't want to be scared of myself I do
have one more product that i picked up
this morning I've been so productive
this morning and I did something that
I'm so happy I did so let me go grab
that for you now I know I said this
would be a drugstore haul in the title
but since I didn't know I starting this
in I'm sorry i just thought i would show
you this this is the dose of colors ice
cream palette if you guys watched my
pass or purchase video on new beauty
products you guys know this was
something i had my eye on and they do
carry this at nummies so i was able to
swatch it in store and i was able to get
a discount on it so i think i paid like
38 and change for it instead of 50 it's
just so beautiful i'm so excited to play
around with this let me know if you guys
want like a swatch video i also think
i'm gonna do like a four looks one
pallet especially if you guys want to
see it so I'm just so excited to dig in
with this and I'm excited to wear it
tomorrow i think i'm gonna put it on my
ass tomorrow i'm so excited it's
beautiful i love the color selection I'm
just really glad that I just made the
purchase on this one I'm really excited
okay that's my Hall guys I hope you
enjoyed the video i will see you in the
next one let me know if there's any
products out there that you guys want me
to try or if you also let me know if
you're excited for the first impression
