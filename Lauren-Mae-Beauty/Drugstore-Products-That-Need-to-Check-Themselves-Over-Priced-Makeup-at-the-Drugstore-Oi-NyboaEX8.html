Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I want to talk about some
drugstore items that need to check
themselves I think we all know that
drugstore prices are increasing and it's
like crazy I don't know what's going on
I think the drugstore should be a place
where you can go and get affordable
makeup and it should still be good
quality I love that the quality has gone
up but the prices skyrocketed with a lot
of these brands and I just don't
understand why I don't think that we're
getting anything that much better I
think it just has to go with the fact
that makeup and beauty and all of that
and just add an all-time high at the
moment with YouTube and with everything
so they are cashing in and I'm over it
so I thought I would bring up some
specific drugstore items that I just
think are incredibly too much money that
I'm saying no to and that they need to
check themselves and a lot of this stuff
isn't even stuff that I don't want to
purchase like it sounds great it might
be an amazing product but what the heck
I could with just a little bit more
money go and buy something high-end you
know so I just it's horrible I want to
say also that I get that you can use
coupons at the drugstore and you can
find some really great deals but I'm
talking about the like suggested retail
price that is put on these items is just
entirely way too high so let's just get
into them I would love to know your
thoughts in the comments down below
let's get into number one so the first
item I have here is the Revlon
Photoready insta filter foundation this
is a newer foundation from Revlon eight
retails for $17.99 and it only has point
9 ounces of foundation in it so you're
not even getting the full ounce of
foundation that's like kind of this
standard it says this has a medium to
buildable finish so you're not getting
something insanely pigmented with this I
think this product sounds nice again a
lot of these products are things that if
they were at a reasonable price I would
actually be willing to try these
products out but when the prices are so
high I feel like the stakes are high I'm
like I don't want to you know spend
almost twenty dollars with tax on this
item and it not work out for me like for
me the drugstore is a place where I
should be able to experiment with
different foundations and colors and all
of that at an affordable price
instead of getting those things at
Sephora so this
Foundation is also running in the trend
of like adding sponges to everything I
know there are other products that have
had sponges for a long time like the
Maybelline instant age rewind little
concealer but this has a huge a huge
sponge on it which is just going to suck
up a ton of your product so you're not
even getting the full ounce and then
it's sucking up the product plus it
isn't the most sanitary thing I love my
Milani retouch any race concealer and it
has a sponge on it but I just I don't
prefer that like oh I especially for the
price so that's the first one it's way
too much money
$18 for a foundation at the drugstore
from Revlon nah no no next is another
item from Revlon this is the Revlon
youth effects fill and blur concealer
again something I think would be totally
up my alley it seems like a really like
medium coverage moisturizing concealer
that would give you a little bit of
coverage but nothing too much but it
retails for $13.99 and it's in a pen
style again it has the little sponge on
it it only has 0.11 ounces in it I just
know that this is going to be so much
money to splash out on a product that's
not gonna last you very long I just wish
this was at a more like eight to nine
dollar range something I noticed when I
was like looking at products is that a
lot of the foundations I feel like that
cater to maybe like an older audience or
have like skincare aging benefits in it
are really really expensive I'm not
trying to say that these aren't going to
be more beneficial to you or that the
claims are wrong where it is better for
your skin but I think they're using
those marketing techniques and their
advertising those products to an
audience that has more money and is like
more willing to spend it I don't know
just give us a good foundation that is
medium to buildable coverage that looks
like skin at a reasonable price the next
item is from L'Oreal then this is the
L'Oreal infallible galaxy Lumiere
holographic eyeshadows these come in
three different colors they look
beautiful I want them so frickin bad but
these are 1290
a piece for a single shadow it's insane
what is happening like am I in an
alternate universe here I know this is a
galaxy shadow but we are still on planet
Earth
these look super beautiful I'm sure
they're really great but for $13 I mean
I feel like Urban Decay eyeshadow is
retail for 18 so this is only a five
dollar difference what's up with that
what is going on I think we should be
again at like maybe an eight dollar
range I would love to see them more at
six but you know I'll take eight the
packaging isn't anything spectacular and
I don't think that the product is that
amazing that it requires that price tag
moving on let's talk about Almay they
have a best blend forever makeup very
similar to the Revlon one because it has
the sponge and everything this retails
for 1699 so you're getting a deal that's
a dollar less than the successful hunt
you do get one ounce and it comes in
twelve different shades it's buildable
and it's it's just too much money guys
it's too much money
foundations I feel like should cap it
like $13 I'm not gonna be mentioning
anything from Physicians Formula because
I feel like they have just always been
true to their high price range whereas I
feel like the prices from the other
drugstore brands are just creeping up
we're and they weren't originally that
high I just really don't think these
should be this expensive in the
drugstore No
next is another product from Almay this
is the palette pops it has nine
different shades in it I feel like this
looks very similar to the Mac times nine
palettes but I have a feeling that this
is the size of like a regular like
eyeshadow quad I don't think this is
anything like a big palette but it
retails for $15 I get that you're
getting nine different shades but these
are gonna be small little pants it says
on the website at this point one six
ounces which I don't know if that's for
each individual eyeshadow or for the
whole thing or if you even measure that
and ounces or not grams I don't know I
just think that this is way too much
money
almay is a brand that I feel like no one
even really buys from and I know that
makeup struggles has the little like
quad and it's like the size of a quarter
so I can only imagine this
like slightly bigger than that next I
want to touch on some elf products
because I feel like elf is like the
affordable brand or one of the
affordable brands at the drugstore you
can get something from them at $2 or $3
and they have been raising their prices
but some of them I'm just like please
get back to your roots y'all and for
this video I wanted to mention the
Velvet Touch eyes shadow palettes these
come in two different colors and this is
something I was actually kind of
interested in trying out but they're
twelve dollars and you get six different
shades in them I just don't think
they're worth the twelve dollars they
have like a gushie or like you know soft
textured eyeshadow feeling to them I
haven't heard really anything about them
I know some people got them in PR when
they first came out and I kind of saw
some stuff but after that it's been like
nothing no one's really trying them and
I think that's part of it too is like no
one wants to experiment and try these
products out because twelve dollars is a
lot of money some people don't even make
that an hour so I really hope that they
can continue to keep their prices low
and not creep up too much higher and and
still do the fun exciting things that we
know and love because I want to try
these products I just don't want to
spend a ton of money to do it next I've
touched on this before but we're gonna
bring it up again
Maybelline and the freakin Gigi Hadid
collection is psycho I am happy for Gigi
that she got this collaboration I am
happy for anyone who is reaching a point
where they can clap with such an
established brand but the actual
products and the prices for these
products is ridiculous the jetsetter
palette retails for $30 and it's ugly
and so it looks ugly to me the outside
packaging is nice it's like very clean
and like this nudey pink and you know
how's your name on it and that looks all
nice and dandy and then you open it up
and it's just disgusting I'm just not a
fan of these like boxy palettes with all
these different products in it I don't
feel like you're getting enough product
to make it even worth $30 it is just not
it's I mentioned before there's no way
in hell that Gigi is using this palette
it doesn't even look high fat like it
doesn't look high-end at all and they're
asking
such an incredibly high price especially
for the drugstore like it's it's
ridiculous that one's like one of the
worst offenders to me as of late I think
that they just really overshot how much
people were willing to spend just
because Gigi's name is on it
and I don't I don't think that was a
success um I wanted to bring up though
that the Gigi Hadid eyeliner the East
Coast glam eyeliner that came with it
was 1199 for a freaking pencil eyeliner
even the liquid eyeliner wasn't that
expensive so I don't know that to me
that pencil should be like five six
dollars and it's double the freaking
price I have two more products to talk
about next I wanted to mention something
from wet and wild now I feel like wet
and wild is one of the brands that is
keeping their stuff affordable they've
just reformulated their eyeshadows and
they're still at the $4.99 and $2.99
prices they have their photo focus
Foundation come out and it was $5.99
like they're doing a very good job of
keeping their prices low and coming out
with quality collections and still
staying fresh and new and on trend and I
really appreciate that and love that
plus they're cruelty free which is
amazing but they recently came out with
a pro brush line and you can order all
of the brushes in it which are ten
different brushes for sixty nine ninety
and that's $70 for ten brushes now if
you divide that out that makes them only
$7 apiece which is really affordable but
I just think that's really expensive for
wet and wild and their demographic and
what they're doing I did see the review
that Tati did and it wasn't like a
glowing review some of the Russians were
okay and some of them weren't I think
the biggest thing for me is that this
set should have just been less money you
can buy all these brushes individually
from between $5.99 and $7.99 so I just
don't feel like you're getting enough of
a deal to buy them in the set this set
should have been like 40 dollars maybe
50 at the max and I just think 70 was
too expensive
it doesn't matter like that's not your
brand you know your branding is
inexpensive and I wish they had tried to
keep that I know they have their other
line of brushes but no I'm not feeling
it it needs to check itself and last I
wanted to bring up a product from Milani
I feel like Milani has been this kind of
like mid-range where they have some
stuff at a pretty good price and then
some of their stuff is like really
expensive and if you like some of the
stuff they're coming out with recently
has been increased in price they have
those two palettes which is not really
on this list which are like $20 apiece
but I hope those are actually good and
if they're good they might be kind of
worth the price but the product that I
was like know what Milani is a kabuki
fan brush from them for $16 no it's too
much money from freakin Milani I'm not
spending $16 on a brush from Milani
I can't do it it's just definitely not
me I'd rather buy something from Real
Techniques I'd rather splurge a little
bit more buy something from Sigma or
zoeva or there's morphe if you want
something affordable like I just don't
know why that product is so expensive I
get that brushes can last you a long
time I'm not knocking that it's not good
quality or that it doesn't work well I
just think for their brand and again the
fact that they're drugstore it's too
much money on a brush like no no I'm
saying no now anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
I get that prices are bound to go up a
bit but I think that a lot of this stuff
is a little bit ridiculous and I think
that they're taking advantage of the
fervor that people have for makeup and
they're raising prices because they know
people are gonna pay for it they know
that there's a frenzy around new makeup
releases and I just find that that's
kind of sad I want to be able to support
these brands I want to be able to try
these products out but some people just
can't afford it but make up as much as
we want to say you don't have to wear
makeup a lot of the times if you want to
be in a more professional setting or
whatever it is you need makeup and if if
the drugstore is expensive how are
people going to be able to afford these
products to be able to put on their face
I feel like makeup as a staple for
almost every woman out there so it's
just kind of sad to see that there
aren't as many affordable options and I
really wish some of these drugstore
brands would take into account their
consumer base and kind of like their
mission statement and hopefully go back
to providing some really quality
products at a great price so let me know
your thoughts in the comments thank you
so so much for watching guys and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
