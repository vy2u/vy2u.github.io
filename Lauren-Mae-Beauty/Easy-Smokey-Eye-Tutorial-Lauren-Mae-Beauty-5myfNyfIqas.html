Lauren this is going to be a tutorial on
the look I'm wearing today it's a darker
smokey eye type of look definitely
something different for me and although
i usually do something lighter and
brighter on the eyes and even a little
more warm than this it's been nice to
kind of switch it up and use this look
I've really been gravitating to this
look the last week or so so i thought i
would show you an easy way to get kind
of i really am just a really simple
smokey eye if you want to find out how
to do this look then just keep watching
hi guys I've already prime my lids using
my by Terry hyaluronic I primer and then
I did set that with a couple of shades
from this palette just a mix between yin
this white shade and this nude shade
from coastal zones now I'm going to go
in with a transition color I'm going to
be taking this Sigma e-40 brush and I'm
going to be taking the color peach
smoothie here from makeup geek and I'm
going to be running that into my crease
and really roughly this one is just like
a first transition color just to make
the other colors even more blendable
this is a more like smoky type of look
so now that i have that funded out i'm
gonna go in with the same brush from
sigma and i'm going to go into the color
cupcake from makeup geek and i'm going
to be putting that in the crease a
little bit lower than the peach cindy
color but definitely still all in the
crease area it's funny because I said I
wasn't going to use pink in my next
tutorial and I am I can't stop you
now i'm going in with a flat shader
brush this is the concealer f70 from
sigma and i'm going to be going into
this really pretty makeup pic shadow
this is the color mesmerised it is one
of their foiled shadows and this is in
the color i normally use this is very
cool toned and dark I usually don't go
that dark and i'm going to putting this
all on my lid and i'm going to bring it
right up into the right to the crease
not into the crease but right about the
crease i'm just going to pack it on
there and we'll blend it out after this
now that I roughly have these same i
shaped going on you should be thoroughly
scared by your makeup at this point you
should think oh my gosh what I've had
done and you're in the right spot I
always find that once I have this song
I'm just like what the heck is going on
but if you think that you're probably
doing it right now I'm going to go in
with another makeup geek eyeshadow this
is a just a fluffy kind of blending
brush but it's a little more tapered
than the e-40 from sigma i'm going to go
into desert sands from makeup geek it's
a really pretty matte like yellowy brown
color I'm in love with it and we're just
going to place this more right basically
where those two colors me we're just
blending out that harsh line that's what
we're going to
you
you can already see such a difference
between the side and this crazy I so
just keep one
once you feel like you have successfully
blended that out I like to go in and I
go in with either the same f40 brush I
always want to call it f e flourish or
just like a clean brush that has no
product and just put a little bit more
of that pink color on the cupcake color
just to kind of blend out a little bit
more and just make sure everything looks
really well blended sometimes I feel
like how much do these people blend but
you know just keep lending just make
sure any harsh lines you might have
going aren't there once you have that
stuff done you could go in and highlight
your brow bone I'm fine the way it looks
I don't want something too too stark
compared to the darkness of my eye next
you're going to go in with liners i'm
going to tightline using my steel at
indigo convertible I color liner you
guys know somebody running the Mary Kay
eyeliner in bronze on my lower lashline
just about halfway in and smudging it
out with my fingers now for the rest of
my lower lash line I'm going to be
taking this little smudge brush this is
the 253 from coastal scents and I'm
going to be taking a mix between cupcake
and desert sands and be running that
against my lower lash line I usually
like to have the more more of the desert
sands close to the lash line and then
the pink more blended outward but
honestly I just mixed them and just
deepen up my lower lash line and I like
to connect it to like the top portion of
my eyes
we are almost done with the eyes I'm
going to go on and highlight using my
lorac pro 2 in the colors snow and I'm
just going to be putting that on to my
inner corners I'm just going to go in a
blend a little bit more cuz I'm a freak
and I just need to pull in more I'm
always nervous when I do a look that's
really dark that it's not going to be
blended in them so glass I'm going to go
in and put some mascara on this is the
flash trifecta from Milani so this is
the final look guys I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial this is definitely
something that's a little out of my
comfort zone but I've really been
enjoying having a different look lately
and I just think it's a fun and it's
pretty simple easy way to do the smoky
eye I just want to say to that it's been
fun filming tutorials lately so I
definitely think I'm going to continue
on leave any requests for specific
tutorials down below in the comments and
I will try to do this for you I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
