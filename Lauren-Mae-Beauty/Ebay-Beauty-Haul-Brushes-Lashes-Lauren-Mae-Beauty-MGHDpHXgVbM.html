Lauren this is going to be a haul of
basically just brushes and lashes that I
got on eBay I have not shopped on eBay
and so long and I really wanted lashes
because lashes are expensive and the way
that I put them on I cut them up and
then like put them on underneath so I
feel like I can't reuse them as easily
as other people they get lost and I need
to use them on clients and all these
things so I just wanted to find some
cheaper lashes and I know that a lot of
people buy their lashes on eBay and that
kind of got me into this wormhole of all
these different makeup things on eBay so
I'm gonna show you guys what I got I'm
gonna link everything down below
hopefully the sellers are still there
and the prices are still the same
although I will say with one of these
sets they already know for sure the
price changed very very soon after I got
them and then kept changing so I think
sometimes the best thing with eBay is to
just go in there yourself give yourself
some time and really scope out the best
deals because there are so many people
selling the same exact thing at a range
of prices so you can find something for
80 cents and then see it somewhere else
for five dollars and it might even be
the same seller selling it and just
listed differently for different prices
it's crazy anyway let's get into the
stuff I will show you guys the brushes
first because I'm most excited about the
brushes I do like the lashes I got two
but I'll just show you brushes one of
the things I really wanted to look for
we're knockoff brushes of more expensive
ones I wanted to just see the quality
compared to what the real one would be
and you cannot be the price difference
so the first set of like dupes I got
were from the Real Techniques and these
are from their precious metals line I
think it's something like that but they
have the gold handle and it's like
pointed at the end they have I believe
all of the different ones but I was only
interested in two of them this person
was like a fluffy powder brush I really
like it because it is more tapered
mine's a little bent right now just
because it was somehow sitting in the
package like that I have not washed this
brush yet at first glance it looks
really nice but it does not have any
weight to it and I have heard that the
other ones have a weight in the handle
this feels kind of cheap the bristles
are really soft though I think they're
pretty dang soft I don't know if they're
soft as the original but I think it's a
really good quality brush for the price
a few hairs that are a little bit longer
but overall I think this is a good brush
and I think I only paid a dollar
something for it so I definitely think
it was worth that I like powder brushes
that are full like this but kind of
tapered in because you can kind of use
it for bronzer and a bunch of other
things so I give this one a yes and I
think it was worth the money and I will
put a little asterisk by all the stuff
that I actually recommend because
there's a few things that I would not
purchase again and just so you can
differentiate that in the description
box and then the other one I got here
was the copper handle same thing it's
very lightweight the cut on this just
seems a little wonky to me it's soft and
everything I could do without this brush
I probably wouldn't repurchase it but
it's not that bad it's not like bad or
anything I just I don't know I can just
tell a little bit that the cut it's just
not cut very well to me that's one thing
I would say about this I'm okay with
having this brush and I'll use it but I
would not repurchase this brush and
honestly I would probably try to find a
different seller and it could be that my
brush is just messed up whereas others
aren't because they're just
mass-produced and they don't really care
about the quality as much so maybe the
one someone else got would be fine but
yeah that's just how I feel about the
one I got another brush I got is kind of
like a dupe of the whole artists brushes
and like doing I don't know you know the
flat little face brushes like this
I got mining rose gold there were so
many of these online and I wanted to
find the rose gold one I think I paid a
dollar for this or maybe even 80 cents
I feel like this sets up a lot of your
product it is really soft but there are
a few hairs that are just like longer
than the other hairs once again but you
can just like cut those off and they
don't like hurt your application or
anything I just personally don't think
that this is that great of a brush I
haven't tried obviously the artist ones
but I usually use a Beauty Blender
anyway I've just started getting back
into brushes on my face and it's just
okay I don't know I'll probably keep
this one and if you're wanting to try it
out I would suggest trying one of these
but personally I just don't think they
work very well not that it's this
brushes fault but more just like this
style of brush this one is obviously
trying to dupe the NARS eita brush this
even says NARS on it this just feels
like a medium softness it's not like
super scratchy but it's not super soft
but I kind of feel like the actual
you brush when I've seen it doesn't look
like it's gonna be like insanely soft
either that's like the density just so
you can see me as I rub my finger along
it I'm not used this yet so I'm not sure
how I'm gonna like it but I feel like
just by looking at it it looks pretty
legit so I think I paid less than two
dollars for this brush so if you're
interested in it I would pick it up just
to see if you like it and like a brush
like this I mean it looks like it it
looks so much like it I feel like that's
my last one for like exact knockoff type
of things so we'll just keep moving I
picked up another kind of short chisel
brush for contour I've seen so many
people use these and I just wanted to
have one and see what the whole hype was
about this one is so much softer than
the NARS one I do like this it's not too
dense but I don't like it for the cheeks
I like this as like a nose contour
that's what I was using it as I like
this I'm happy about this brush I think
again this one was definitely less than
two dollars and I am enjoying it so I
would definitely suggest it another
brush that I was really excited to get
is this really big fan brush I have like
the dinky little fan brush from ELF and
I've used that for a long time but I've
seen one of these I think from makeup
forever has like a really nice one of
these and I really wanted something like
it for the longest time but I just
didn't want to purchase anything so when
I saw this again for like less than two
dollars I really wanted to try it out
this is pretty nice it's pretty sloppy I
don't know about the other ones but it's
super soft the bristles I like it I've
been using it I used it on a couple
clients as well so this is something I
definitely suggest as well it did come
like there's a few hairs I feel like
that are kind of like jacked up because
it's just the shape of the fan brush but
I feel like my other fan brush does that
as well so I think that this one is
really good for the price especially and
it's really soft
that's something that I was the most
shocked with with all these brushes was
that so many of them were soft I thought
they were gonna come and be the
scratches things ever but most of them
bristle quality-wise from just feeling
them I can't really tell
too much of a difference from like Real
Techniques type of quality so
that's exciting I picked up a set of
four eye brushes I believe these came
all together I thought these are gonna
be kind of like the Sigma e-40 brushes
or whatever precision brushes that
basically look like the kabuki face
brushes but small for the eyes but I do
not think that they are they are all
really soft I really like that about
them the biggest issue I have with these
is just the quality of the cut is not
very good this is the flat top one and I
just feel like it's a little bit off
it's not quite even flat across the top
but it's really soft and you could still
use it I'm just saying you know it's a
little dirty I guess this one is just
like a blender brush it's nice I've used
this one I've used most of the brushes
and this one's nice I would maybe just
purchase this one by itself though
instead of the whole kit this one's
supposed to be the ankles one and it
just looks so derped out it's not a
harsh angle so it just looks like maybe
half of it got chopped off still really
soft and everything and I definitely can
still use it it's just not super quality
which again I didn't pay a lot of money
for him but just something to know and
then this one was really cool this is a
pencil brush but it's definitely bigger
than the pencil brush I have I've been
using this I think this is a good one
too quality wise cut wise I like this
one and then I wanted to get some
brushes that were dupes of the Sigma
kabuki brushes so I picked up this set
here this was I think it was less than
three dollars for all of them something
like that I wanted to make sure I got
like the cheapest one ever I don't
really suggest it the Farrell's are kind
of like loose one of them already came
off like as I was touching it from the
packaging the bristles are pretty soft
but it's just not worth it to me I just
would honestly prefer and rather have a
couple of the Sigma ones that are gonna
last a long time than have these but
this is like the domed one I just
the cut is a little bit off again as
well it's just definitely not quality
and not gonna last you like at all
obviously if one already broke this is
the one that broke off but this is kind
of like the angled kabuki again it's
soft but not worth it to me and then
this is the flat top kabuki I feel like
this one is a nice and probably one of
the best ones out of it but it's not
like loose or anything but I feel like
this is smaller than the Sigma one I
don't obviously have that one but I feel
like this covers less space and I just
if I knew they were gonna come like this
I wouldn't have ordered them and the
last one here is kind of like that domed
one this is nice I like putting on cream
highlight with this I think that's a
nice way to use this or maybe blend up
concealer I haven't had the best of luck
but I know a lot of people do that too
this is probably the best quality one
out of all of them the ferrule isn't
moving around and I feel like the cut
and the bristles and the softness are
all like the exact same quality you
would get in a different rush this is
definitely the best one out of all four
of the ones that came but I really don't
suggest getting that set and the last of
my brushes I know I got a lot of brushes
it's gonna be kind of a long video you
guys have seen most of these before but
these are going off with the Real
Techniques brushes this first one here I
really like this is a like it could be a
really large eyeshadow brush or like a
really small face brush I've used this
to set powder under the eyes to do a
highlight to set my primer on my eyelids
like for eyeshadow I really like this
brush I think I paid like 69 cents or
something for it I love that there's no
ferrule to like come off that's
something I really like about Real
Techniques brushes the quality the
softness everything about this I really
like so I highly recommend this brush
and then you guys have heard me talk
about this in my favorites video I
really like all of these brushes I got
all of these brushes for $0.99 all of
them as a set it was crazy it was a
really really good deal this is the one
I was talking about that the price went
up after I bought it so I think the cut
on these is really nice the softness is
amazing and they're just overall so much
better than that last set of face
brushes I gave you so that's why I
wouldn't even bother with those you
don't have to worry about the fair
coming loose on these and I didn't have
any shedding with any of them except for
a little bit with this one the first
time I used it so I'll just go over
these really fast this one is kind of
like that last domed like you can use
this concealer a cream highlighter this
is like a round top face brush I really
like that one this one looks a lot like
one they actually already have this is
the angled flat top this is a duo fiber
a small one I really like this to
stipple on cream blush to put on a
foundation if you want like a light
layer more natural look I really like
that brush and then this one is just a
straight up flat top so I will have the
ones I really like down below and let me
know if there's any brushes you really
like I honestly was really happy with
most of the quality I got I feel like
the few things that didn't work out it
was worth it to get the things that did
work out price-wise I think for
everything in this video I spent $40 or
less for everything which is crazy now
onto the lashes I ordered a lot of
lashes but none of these cost more than
$2 a piece and they all came with at
least 5 pairs of lashes so that's an
amazing deal when you think about our
del being like on sale like a really
good price at 3 something so I'm really
really happy with most of these again I
feel like there are some does but the
ones that did work out I feel like we're
worth the cost of the other ones to
figure out which ones would be good if
that makes sense I'm going to show you
my favorite lashes first these ones I've
already used two pairs up up and I
absolutely love them there there's a
sticker on the back that says 820 I'll
have these link down below as the first
lash one these are so nice to do the
under lashes with and cut them up
they're so long they give you thickness
but length I really like them I feel
like they look like iconic lashes or any
of those like really kind of like PC
wispy type of lashes and I paid again
like a dollar 70 something for five
pairs of them they have a clear band
which is my favorite type of band to use
I don't like a really thick band or a
really dark band because I like to hide
it and I don't like to wear liner so
those are my favorite ones every single
one of the lashes I got has a clear band
except for one pair but these are the
ones I recommend the most out of all of
them obviously I haven't tried them all
but out of the ones that I have tried
these are absolutely amazing and I want
to order like five more of them next I
have these lashes these are kind of
thinner on the inside and thicker and
longer on the outside I just wanted to
try something different I haven't tried
them on yet but I do think the quality
of them is nice and they all do look
like even if that makes sense because
that's an issue I had with some of them
they all do match and like you'd be able
to put them on your each eye and it
wouldn't look different than each other
so I'm excited to try these ones out
this is another pair of lashes that I
got and these are different because they
don't crisscross like the other ones but
they have the clear band and they're
kind of just even across they're not
long on the outside and there they're a
little bit longer I guess on the inside
so they're gonna give you more of like a
round eye but these are really nice I
feel like these are good like everyday
for any one type of lash this is a pair
I was talking about that I do not
recommend these just look so different
from one lash to the next some are
really short some are a lot longer I
just feel like they're very inconsistent
with how they look so it might be tough
when I'm actually applying these on the
eye to get an even look I would not
bring these in my kit because I just
feel like I can't depend on them they're
definitely gonna be just for myself and
I won't be repurchasing these ones
although I do like the overall look of
the lashes again the quality is just not
there when it comes to them being
consistent I decided to pick up a pair
of just like half lashes and these are
actually brown which I didn't realize
but I thought these would be a nice one
for just like really simple looks or
people who don't need a ton of lashes
but just need a little something I
thought this would be nice one of the
things that you'll notice when you order
is that everyone's only kind of the same
thing just again at different prices so
I did get two of these in the same type
of packaging these look very similar to
the ones in the blue packaging and I
haven't tried these on yet but they do
see maybe a little bit shorter that's
the only difference but again they're
really beautiful lashes I would still
recommend these because the quality of
them is nice and they are consistent
from one pair to the next but I just
haven't tried them on the eye to see if
they're that same kind of length
I love how spikey they are and wispy
they are though this is another pair
looks really similar to the blue ones
it's just in pink packaging I did try
these on and again it just doesn't seem
like they were as long that's what I'm
talking about so that's why I like the
blue ones also this did not come with an
outer case it literally came shipped to
me like this so all of the lashes were
exposed I could easily get bent or
something so I don't suggest this seller
I would suggest the other two just
because of they could get damaged
they're still really nice and again that
same type of shape I went for a very
similar shape I tried to be very safe
with myself in the lashes that I thought
I would actually like two more pairs or
two more types this one is probably the
longest I got it's very natural and
again it has the clear band it's even
across all the lashes so they're not
longer on the outside or the middle I
thought these would just be basic lashes
to just amp up your look I haven't tried
them on yet I do prefer the other ones
just as a preference for myself and your
last figure is like the craziest pair I
got these ones do not have a clear band
but I just kind of wanted to try them
they look super wispy they almost look
like like spiders on your eyes I
probably will not repurchase these just
because they don't have the clear band
and I don't know I'm just a little
scared to work with them they look
really fake to me like if you were
looking down I feel like people would be
able to tell it was fake lashes I don't
necessarily recommend these but I know a
lot of people like a thicker band or
don't mind a thicker band so and there's
one more thing actually this is an
eyebrow pencil that I decided to pick up
this was 69 cents or 79 cents I go
through eyebrow pencils like no one's
business and I thought I'm gonna try one
that is cheaper I thought since this
wasn't gonna be like on my eyeballs that
I would risk it and potentially find
something so that's the color there it
is a bit dark this is the lightest they
had I have this in my eyebrows today on
the outer portion that's mostly what I
use it for is just to kind of make the
tail of my brow I enjoy it and I think
it works well what I repurchase I'm not
sure but it was only 70 cents so it's
not a big deal this is the color coffee
and it's from the brand fairy girl it'll
be linked down below again if you want
to try it out but if you type an eyebrow
pencil a ton of sellers have this and
sell these so that's everything for this
haul guys I hope you guys enjoyed I
haven't been
eBay cents I bought all this stuff so I
don't know when I'll go back on again I
probably will definitely get more of
those lashes I feel overall really happy
with the purchases I made let me know
what some of your favorite things you've
got off of ebay are and maybe I can
check them out and that's everything
I'll see you guys in my next video bye
