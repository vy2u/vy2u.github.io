Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a gift guide video
I've never done a gift guide video on my
channel before but I have seen so many
in my feed lately and it got me thinking
along with the fact that I just placed
an elf order over the Cyber Monday or
Black Friday holiday is it a holiday I
don't know and they had 50% off and I
was thinking you know I wanted to do a
haul and whatnot and I've been trying
all the makeup and stuff and I thought
it would be cool to create gift like
packages essentially from ELF because
they're affordable all under $25 and
themed so yeah I thought you because
that's what I'm doing I hope that
concept makes sense I think it will as
we move on and I talked about like my
ideas and the products I'm talking about
the reason that I just did elf this
isn't sponsored in any way at all I went
back and forth between doing just like
random beauty products and keeping it
under a price point and keeping it
themed but I thought realistically it's
like if you are shopping maybe a little
bit more last-minute you could get all
of these products either on the elf
website or in California I know we have
elf stores so you can just walk in and
like pick all of these products up which
is awesome so I thought it would be more
simple like in practicality I guess if
someone was actually gonna do any of
these but if anything this can also just
be inspiration for you something that I
like to do when I do give gifts is I
love making like little baskets of like
a ton of crap I just like love doing
stuff like that so that is where I'm
going with this
and I themed them for like different
people that have different personality
or different ages you can obviously
substitute as you will but that's enough
talking let's get into the first one I
have four different like options to
choose from and we'll get into it so the
first bundle of products is for your spa
girl or woman it doesn't have to be
someone young but these are all kind of
like for pampering it's more focused on
skincare and not necessarily like color
products or really like beauty makeup
products elf has in the last couple of
years really stepped up their game when
it comes to skincare and masks and all
of that type of stuff so they have a ton
of options on the website I of course
for this keeping it under $25 or at 25
dollars had to be pretty picky with what
I chose so of course you guys can you
know switch this up for whatever you
want on that website they even had
bundles already pre-made for you like a
whole skincare regimen or whatever so do
what you want but this is again you came
here for my ideas um these are mine so
the first item in this basket are the
hydro under-eye gels now they have two
different options they have these new
charcoal ones but they also have just
the original ones they come in three
pairs of two three pairs I guess I don't
need to add the two part it's redundant
but those retail for eight dollars
I love cooling under eye gels I've
talked about the pathology ones in the
past and these are just like an
affordable option I think that these
would be fun to even do on Christmas Day
like how fun would that be so that is
definitely a great one I think they'd
work for so many different people
whether it's something more fun and
playful or something actually needed I
think that would be a really awesome
gift next is the lip exfoliator now I
actually have this one with me so I'll
show you it this is what it looks like
it's in a lipstick tube now if you watch
Emily Noelle you've probably seen this a
million times
but this is so awesome I've been using
it recently and it's amazing I've had
this for a while and I just haven't been
using it for whatever reason this
retails for three dollars and it's such
an easy way to exfoliate the lips to
either prep them at night for lip balm
and then that can sink in throughout the
night or before you put on your like
matte lipstick or whatever it is so I
think this is such an awesome like
prepping step and I think it fits into
the spa category really well too next on
the list is the refreshing coconut mist
and now this is a six dollar product I
don't know how the sprayer is on this
product that is something like I haven't
tried all of these things I was just
going through the website it was so much
fun like what would I put oh you know
making baskets and whatnot so I think
this would be a really nice one you
could use this as a prep spray before
you go in with moisturizer and serum you
could use it as like an over makeup
setting spray or just kind of a
refresher spray throughout the day so I
love the coconut scent so hopefully the
sprayers good if you've used it let us
know your thoughts down below but that
would be a fun one for this set as well
so I forgot
you I have two different options for
this one so like one of them equals $25
and one of them is $22 so this is still
in that first option next is an
exfoliating scrub now honestly the
reason I put this on here because the
price point was so awesome it's $5 for a
scrub
I think scrubs are really important I
love a physical exfoliant I don't know
how good this one is because let me tell
you I am also picky about my scrubs I
really want to try it I wish I had
bought it in my order because I would
about a half off for 250 what but I did
it anyway I thought that would be just a
nice addition to the kit kind of beast
it up a little bit and definitely
something that's practical and could be
used and then last for the kit is a
sheet mask this is a hydrating sheet
mask it retails for $3 and all that
stuff combined equals 25 dollars for
this bucket now you can also do another
option so all the stuff is the same
except for the very first product that I
mentioned which were the hydro under-eye
gels and we're gonna eliminate those and
instead we're gonna add on the eye
refresh which this is a $3 product I
actually have that to show you as well I
picked this up in that most recent order
and this is a like plastic it's not
metal but it's a metal ball that you
roll and your eye and its most helped d
puff and kind of like stimulate that
area so that it's not as tired looking I
was looking at the reviews on the
website and people loved this product
there are people who have been using
this for years and years and years I use
it today and it is nice I want to
obviously use it more to see how it
works and what not but um I think this
is just kind of like a fun extra little
thing and if someone especially has
tired under eyes or really puffy dark
circles I think this would be a nice one
to kind of counteract that and it also
just is like this really pampering extra
step in your routine and then the other
products you would also add or could add
is the acne spot treatment pen this is a
$2 product and obviously not everyone's
gonna need this and you can like use
your discretion if it's gonna like be
kind of distasteful to give someone this
I personally don't think so in the
confines of the entire kit but you know
if someone doesn't have acne or you
don't think has a need for it maybe you
don't have to give it to them but I
think it just kind of is a nice overall
rounded gift set and everyone gets the
occasional pimple so that second bundle
option for the spa hit retail
for $22 so both of those I think would
be awesome additions you can obviously
go over or under in budget whatever you
want to do but I really like the idea of
this pocket this video is gonna be long
- my gosh I'm glad I'm in a talking move
but I'm also sorry that these are mom
the next bundle is for the I put on here
social media savvy girl is this someone
who watches a lot of like Instagram
tutorials this is definitely for someone
who's into maybe a heavier makeup look
or a more sculpted just very Instagram
makeup I don't want that to come across
as negative everyone has their own taste
and everyone you know can do whatever
they want with their makeup they can
love glam as heck or they can be more
natural whatever you think but this one
is going to focus on like contouring and
highlighting in that type of stuff so
the first thing in here is the contour
palette now you would have to pick the
one that's going to fit their skin tone
but this retails for six dollars it's a
cult favorite for ELF
you get four different powders I think
this would be a great way for someone to
try out some contouring products and
yeah it's at a great price the next item
is a baked highlighter now if you're
gonna get in the big tile order you
better make sure you tell them to scrub
off the top layer I don't know how many
times I've either heard that we're
seeing it in the comments of videos but
um these baked highlighters are really
popular products from ELF again like I
said though I think a lot of people know
you have to scrub off the top layer
alright potential you might have to so
maybe give them that little tidbit of
information but I think this would be a
great you know more blinding highlight
for someone to use and that retails for
$4 but again you could pick the shade
that you think would match their skin
tone or look best for them and then with
that I think the highlighting brush is a
really nice option you can use it to
highlight I also feel like you could
potentially use that brush to contour
because it is more of like a pointed you
know oval type of shape and I think you
could really get into the hollows of the
cheek with it and then last for this I
have two options for this one too
because like lord knows I cannot make
decisions
I'm just extra like seriously I'm always
so extra when it comes to gifts it's one
of my love languages the last item for
the first like addition of this bundle
is this
new product from hell it's their phone
light now you can add this I think to
like the phone jack and it lights up and
I thought that would just be like kind
of a cool fun thing to add this retails
for $12 so but I think it kind of goes
well with the set and I think that these
phone lights sometimes are things that
like we think are cheesy or like
whatever but if they're gonna help you
get some bomb Instagram photos like we
also love that too so you know you
sometimes just have to have no shame
about what you're doing like same with
the selfie stick like the selfie stick
is awesome it actually works even though
you feel ridiculous
so for the second option for this we're
gonna keep everything the same but we're
gonna eliminate the light because maybe
they don't want the light I don't know
maybe you think the light is stupid so
instead of the light we're gonna add the
contour brush now this is gonna go well
with the contouring set from before I
just thought it would be nice to have
like the highlighter with the brush and
the contour with the brush like I said
that retails for $6.95 one here is in
the shade TIROS now I will say these as
the most matte they have a little bit of
a shine honestly to them but I think
these are great I love lipsticks in this
type of form ideally I would have put in
the liquid lipstick but that cost $5 and
we would have been over budget so if you
want to go with the liquid matte
lipstick you can also do that I think
that's a little bit more Instagram
friendly but you know we're ballin on a
budget baby so those are my two options
for someone who's really into social
media or wants to look like some of
their gurus on social media the next
bundle of items is for the more
adventurous person on your Christmas
list someone who likes the dual Chrome's
likes the glitter likes fun colors just
likes to have fun with their makeup they
don't want you know just the normal
brown matte colors so the first thing
that I thought would be such a great
pick for them are the highlighting duo's
they have three
that are in like a duochrome form I
think there one's called mermaid's tail
and that's like the pink and purple and
then they have like a blue / greenish
type one I think this would be super fun
the quality wise from the reviews that
I've seen I don't know if they're like
the best but for the price I think
they're good and if you think that
someone's really gonna like them I think
they'd be a good buy I don't know if I
told you but the highlighters retail for
eight so they're a little bit more but
you do get quite a lot of product in two
different shades the next item are the
Stardust glitter eyeliners I picked up
two of these and they come in four
different shades in total I picked up
pink opal as well as seafoam I do have
seafoam on my inner corners today over a
light green yellow shadow and I think
these are super duper fun these are not
going to be as glittery as something
like the urban decay ones I mean the
price point on these is $4 so they're I
mean they're totally different when it
comes to price but if you're looking for
something fun in iridescent I think
these would look so cool over a black
liner I think that someone who loves
color and fun things would love these
they also have a silver and a gold if
you think that's more of their Ally I
really do like these though the next
item is the pulp of glitter gel this
retails for $4 and I was looking at
reviews online and you know everyone was
like and but I think these would be
great over the skin or on the lips I
think that anyone again who loves
glitter would find a way to make these
work but I don't think they will be good
for the eye so just throwing that out
there if that's what you think they're
gonna be used for I would pick up
something else so the big kind of item
in this set I feel like I'm like over
what am i doing I just realized that I'm
over guys oops we're getting rid of the
glitter gel I don't get that get the
liners so the big item in this bundle is
the mad firm matte eyeshadow palette now
this is a new one let me actually look
it up on the website because it's like
the jewel tones it's so so pretty
alright so the official name of this is
the matte for Matt eyeshadow palette in
the shade jewel pop it's all matte
shadows but they're really really fun I
think this would be a great addition to
some
I haven't seen reviews yet I know makeup
circle says she's gonna get it and
review it so look out for that in the
future but I think that would be a
really fun addition to the bundle and
then the last item since we got rid of
the glitter pop we have a little bit of
room I believe yeah we're gonna be
perfect at 25 so the last one is just a
lip product I just put randomly a lip
product for three dollars whatever you
think would be like a fun pop of color
something they would enjoy they have a
lot of different options on the website
so I think just picking something that's
going to be a color or a formula that
would work for the person that you're
shopping for would be a great addition
to this bundle we are onto the last
bundle and this one is just for elf
favorites these are like tried-and-true
products these are cult favorites from
ELF this one probably has the most items
in it because they're at a smaller price
range
I feel like elf started as the brand
that everything was either $1 or $3 like
that was everything in the line and so a
lot of the products that have been
tested over the years are still at that
price range the first thing that I have
in here is the baked highlighter again
this is the one you're gonna want to
scratch off the top layer but this is
something that definitely gets raved
about on the YouTube and I think would
be a great addition to an elf's favorite
kit for someone next I'm again putting
into the lip exfoliator I think this
thing is so awesome I'm totally with
Emily Noelle on it I love how easy it is
to use you can just exfoliate your lips
they look great and they're prepped for
anything you're gonna put on it so I
think this is just an amazing product
and definitely something I would throw
in a kit for someone so we're at four
dollars and three dollars the next
product you guys know I couldn't make it
through in health video without talking
about my brow product this is the brow
pencil from health and this is not the
most recent one they have a new one
that's even skinnier and very much
reminiscent of the anasazi one but this
one is two dollars I cannot get over at
such a great price I've gone through
probably five or six of these I have
about six of them is back up right now
because again I got a lot of them half
off so they were only a dollar love that
product obviously you would get that
indie shade that's going to best match
who you're shopping for my mom is also
using it now and she freaking loves it
too
we're bringing up another product I've
already talked about and that is the
matte lip color from ELF these retail
for three dollars and they have a ton of
different shades I know there's like a
praline there's like a really pretty
ruby red color again tea rose from ELF
is a really popular color as well it's
like a cool-toned kind of purple mauve
color I really enjoy that lip product
formula and a lot of people do so I
think that would be a great one to add
into the favorites bundle I decided to
throw in one of these shadow primers
these retail for two dollars
I'm assuming that you're giving these to
people who maybe like makeup but you are
more the expert in the relationship you
know they don't love makeup as much as
you love makeups so you're kind of
bestowing some information on these
people you're you know letting them know
what's up and I think a lot of people
don't use an eye primer and it's
important a lot of us have creasing or
shadows just don't show up as brightly
or fade throughout the day and an
eyeshadow primer was one of the first
things that I was like this is literally
magic so I think adding an eyeshadow
primer in there is definitely going to
potentially change someone to make it
game so I would throw that in there we
have three more products in here I'm
gonna add these up really fast make sure
I'm not like a crazy person I talked
about how I'm not good at linguistics
but I might not be good at math either
y'all $24 hey we under budget okay so
next after the shadow primer is a blush
and the three dollar blushes from health
the studio line in the black packaging
that's very reminiscent of the NARS
packaging those are like they've been in
their line people love those blushes so
picking out one of those colors I think
would be really nice I have a ton of
different shades I think that wait at
least six shades that you can choose
from the next like cult favorite product
that I've heard so much about over the
years on YouTube is the elf under eye
setting powder I finally got my hands on
it I finally decided to purchase it and
I think this would be a great one to put
into the kit I just felt like we
couldn't have an elf favorites bundle
without putting this in and then the
last item that I wanted to put in here
was something that's a little bit newer
but I've heard amazing reviews about and
this is
a I shadow trio and the color that I
want to put in is the Rose a all day
it's gonna be up on the screen you guys
have been seeing these throughout the
video this is going to take forever it
of it this has a I think has to match
shades in one sparkly shade I feel like
it's very Universal the color selection
is something I think a lot of people
would like and it kind of completes this
bundle as almost a full face to make up
obviously we don't have any like
foundation and face products really in
here but I think you could do a lot of
your makeup routine with these items and
I think the eyeshadow trio really just
completes it I really hope you guys
enjoyed this gift guide I know it was
kind of weird if you want to see another
gift guide of like things $20 and under
just like you know kind of holiday gift
sets that I think would be good buys or
that I'm interested in I can always do
that as well but I thought this would
just be a fun way to do a gift guide
kind of a different take let me know
what you guys think down below and if
you have any reviews on any of these
products like if you're like no girl
that is so bad
definitely leave that information in the
comments I really like having that as a
resource for people to like look through
it's more community that way and I
really enjoy that so um that's
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye
oh shoot also really fast before I go do
you guys want to see an elf haul or
would you rather see like the haul and
review all in one has it been testing
things out let me know okay I'm really
leaving now bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
