sickness is said again oh no it started
this morning it's like in my chest
though it's not even like how it
normally I normally get sick it is like
deep in the depths of my lungs and it
hurts so so bad anyway hi guys welcome
back to my channel it's Lauren thank you
so so much for watching today I'm going
to do an elf haul and review I've had
this stuff for awhile I ordered it on
Black Friday because they were having a
50% off sale and I didn't want to get
too caught up in the hype of like Black
Friday but I knew that was a pretty good
deal for elf I know they do those sales
other times of the year but I thought I
would take advantage of the one going on
I wanted to try some new products from
them I think I really only loved the
eyebrow pencil that you guys know I talk
about all the time so I thought I would
try some other products out of the deal
and not you know be out as much money so
I have a whole basket here I think this
is everything I mean since I've been
using this it's kind of got dispersed
into my makeup drawers and so I tried to
be good about like collecting all this
stuff so let's just get into it I've
tried almost all of this stuff at least
once so I can give you kind of like a
mini review and if anything you guys
will see these on other portions on my
channel and the things I really love
you'll definitely keep hearing about so
I guess I'm just gonna start off with a
dud product because I hated this this is
the elf beautifully precise sponge this
is in my disappointing products video
these just aren't good these are twelve
dollars - which is just so not worth it
oh my gosh I can't get it out it comes
with three different sponges these are
just really hard and not worth it there
are so many other sponges that I've
heard amazing things about and this one
is just not good so just stick with the
Beauty Blender Real Techniques sponge
any of the other sponges you've heard
good things about this is just not worth
it so bad a product I really liked this
is the elf waterproof gel eyeliner I
have mine in the shade coffee and this
is so nice it's just a nice dark brown
I like to tightline with this and this
does stay really really well on my tight
line it's kind of hard to get it off at
night actually which is good and bad I
find that I don't get it in my you know
inner corner throughout the day which is
like a big plus for me but I also hate
that it's hard to get off so overall my
love for this
than my hate I think it's a great price
I think I paid four dollars for it
because it is a newer item I couldn't
get half off on it
but I would pay four dollars for this I
think it's really good I decided to pick
up quite a few brushes on this order
because I think the brushes are really
inexpensive but if I can get them half
off like I'm Way more down for that
price so the first one here is the
foundation blurring brush I've been
using this for my foundation for I've
used it at least five six seven times
it's not my favorite for a foundation
it's just a little small and also my
like something a little bit flatter this
has a point to it and I find the point
kind of makes it difficult to get a good
blend so I don't think that it's a
foundation blurring brush I don't think
it's very good at that but I do think
it's a nice brush and I think I could
use it for other things but for
foundation it's not my favorite this was
so disappointing this is the elf like
mask brush I really wanted this for my
mascara movies and also just to apply
masks this is like a silicone piece so I
thought oh that's gonna be great
it sucks I hate it so much it doesn't
work very well it's a little too flimsy
I don't feel like I can spread the
product on evenly I just suggest going
to the art store like Michael's getting
a really cheap arts and crafts brush
that's what I have that's what I use and
I like it better than this and you don't
have to waste the money on this like
gimmicky product I was hoping it'd be
life-changing but it's not just a
gimmick a brush I loved this is the elf
pointed powder brush I suggest this for
everyone it's amazing you can use this
for so much I currently love it the most
for a bronzer but you could use this for
powder and I think it'd be great you
could use it for blush and I think you'd
be great for three dollars with a price
that I pay for this I would get like
four more of these brushes it's really
soft
I love the pointed edge it can help me
get bronzer in a precise area but
because it's fluffy I can also blend it
out it's just great this is a brush I've
only used a couple of times so I don't
know how I feel about it it's the selfie
ready skin Perfector I just thought this
looked really interesting I've used it
to apply like the illuminizer and things
like that but it's not my favorite for
that I don't know I still need to play
around with it I'd
dislike it I definitely think it's
interesting I think I can find a way to
use it I just haven't found it quite yet
so for three dollars definitely not mad
at the price but for three dollars I'm
definitely not mad at the price oh this
would be great to maybe blend out the
bronzer stick from milk I'm gonna try
that next
I think it's okay the jury's still out
it's something I have yet to use but I'm
really excited to try as the silicone
glitter applicator it looks like a doe
foot but it's silicone super weird I
don't know how it's really gonna help
but I'm gonna try no and the last brush
that I have here is the crease brush I
got this in the mail and was like lector
heck this is so dinky and stupid but I
actually really like this I think
Jessica Braun really really likes this
product as well and I get why it's so
precise and tiny you can really buff out
without getting it everywhere you know
you don't carry it up too far in the
crease really been enjoying this brush
and I'd go in with like my Sigma e-40
first but if I really want some precise
application this is really nice I
definitely can see myself picking up
quite a few more of these for my kit and
just to have a couple of course I picked
up some brow products so this is my
absolute favorite brow pencil it's two
dollars it's the naturally beautiful I
don't know it's a two dollar brow pencil
it's super great it's a creamy formula
instead of a hard wax formula I really
like it in the tail of my brows and I
like the color pop one in the front
portion I've talked about that a lot
lately and then I picked up a clear brow
gel because I did not like the color pop
one that I bought and this one is really
awesome so look at how tiny this wand is
so so tiny it's pretty dirty because I
have been using it and I also used it
today so it's a little orange I just
think this is really great it doesn't
give a ton of hold but I can really
brush through my brows delicately
without removing too much product
because I do have blonde brows naturally
and I can get them to stand up and look
really just like fine and just so good I
really like this it's five dollars I
think that's still a really great price
I definitely can see myself for
purchasing this and I real
like the packaging looks like sleek and
nice this is something I haven't tried a
ton but I just it's like whatever it's a
whatever product I don't even know what
it's called I'll have it linked down
below though and it has this like
applicator on it it's like a clear gloss
I'll swatch it for you guys
Oh while the pigment isn't even in it
that much oh gosh
didn't realize that I just don't think
it's worth it I don't think it's worth
the price right you're gonna pay for
this I don't suggest it just like don't
save up your money and get a gloss
laffinty gloss that's just to pick my
favorite it's not sticky but it's not
not sticky either I just don't like it
it's just not worth it another product
to me that's just not worth it at least
for the amount of time I've tried it is
the elf translucent mattifying powder I
was excited to try this to see what it's
like but it's definitely not translucent
it has a tint to it like it's tinted and
so I don't know it's just not my
favorite I kind of wish I tried a
translucent powder instead another
powder that I finally tried is the elf
under eye setting powder this has been
talked about so much and I was excited
to give it a try I don't know how I feel
about this I do think it's really finely
milled so I like the way it looks in
texture under the eye but I find that it
almost like darkens the under eye a
little bit I don't know I just wish it
brightened I really want to try the bare
minerals I'm like brightener powder that
is something that's on my like wish list
I know that's like an old old product
but I want to try it out because that's
what I want I want something that sets
it but then I can kind of buff under
there and bright in that area as well so
it's okay I don't regret this purchase
but I'm not like in love with it so far
I did pick up a couple skincare type of
products this first one is the elf i
refresh this is a rollerball product
where you roll it on the under eye and
it's supposed to like deep puffs and
just cool and I think it works for the
price this is three dollars I definitely
think it's worth the three dollars I
don't have a ton of like puffy under
eyes so I don't know how much I really
need this product but I think it's nice
I think it works for the price I think
it's worth it
the next product is the elf daily
hydration moisturizer I think this
retails for eight dollars but I got it
for four and that's the reason that I
bought it because it was so
expensive this is a very thin
moisturizer so I definitely think it'd
be good for oily skin in the daytime to
go on right before makeup although in
the winter it's just not quite enough
moisture unless I put my makeup on like
right after I apply it I also find that
when I get out of the shower or if my
face is more like raw I guess you could
say and I put this on it can sting so I
think this has quite a bit of alcohol in
it I don't think it's like a really good
skin care product like in my head it's
like it's better than no lotion but it's
definitely not a good quality lotion I
probably won't repurchase it but if I
was really like if you're on strapped on
cash you can't you can't buy nice
skincare you know what I mean
so I don't know I don't know how I feel
about this I'm going to continue to use
it I just don't know if I would
repurchase it and I'm not sure if I
really suggest it I did decide to pick
up a highlighter which is a little bit
different for me I don't pick up a ton
of highlighters this is the shimmer
highlighting powder in the shade pearl
glow they have quite a few of these
highlighters on like blinding you they
have quite a few of these highlighters
in different colors which i think is
really nice and I think this is very
similar to the Lancome one that I have I
mean it's very very just it feels nice
but it doesn't go on super metallic
which is nice I don't know I've been
enjoying this for $6 it's a little
expensive to me but for the $3 I paid
for it I think it's worth that so yeah I
think it's nice
it also doesn't just like flash only
white it has a bit more of a complexity
complexity to it so yeah I do like it
I think it's nice looking I think that's
a nice sheen you know nothing too much
but definitely something I think we're
almost at the end here the next product
I actually did not get the chance to use
yet I've been just trying out the
palettes lately trying to make sure I
can get reviews up of that hopefully
soon but this is a little like duo in
the shade pink pal and what I love about
these is one sides matte one side is
shimmery so it's like the perfect
everyday simple duo I love how tiny it
is
it's like a little cheapy but it's also
just nice and compact so I'm excited to
try this I think this would work really
well for someone who wants something
that's super low maintenance easy and I
love that they put a mat in each one of
them a love of mine this is the elf
primer super great I love the shade of
this one it's in the color sheer but I
don't think it's that that sheer it does
lighten and kind of brighten my eye area
which I like I've been enjoying it I
love the doe foot applicator I would
suggest this for two dollars yes and I
believe the last items are two glitter
eyeliners I think these are newer
products there are four different colors
as like a bold a silver and then these
two this one here is seafoam and it has
like an iridescent green shift to it
it's so pretty it also has a little bit
of like a blue but that's it they're
really pretty it's not like crazy
sparkly but definitely adds a nice like
iridescent to the inner corner in the
lower lashline and then this one is in
the color pink opal and this looks like
a hot pink flash and it also shifts like
gold they're really cool I think for the
price they're worth it they aren't as
bad as like the hard candy one I just
hate that one but these I thought were
really nice and I'm enjoying using them
so that is everything for my elf haul
interview I hope you guys enjoyed this I
just I've been discovering that I love
affordable makeup that's like my
favorite thing I mean don't get me wrong
I love high-end stuff that works really
nice and all of that but it's just so
hard for me to part with my money man
anyway I hope you enjoyed let me know
what some of your favorite elf products
are down below what I should try next
and I will see you in my next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
