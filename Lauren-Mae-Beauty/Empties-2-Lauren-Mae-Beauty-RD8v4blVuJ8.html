is Lauren and today I have an empties
video for you guys it may seem like I
have done an empties video quite
recently but that stuff was actually
filmed when I was in Arizona was my
first video ever and I didn't want to
take that stuff with me to California so
I filmed it and then I just didn't get
it up for a while so it has been a while
and I do have some stuff to share I also
thought I would mention that I'm not
going to be putting any of my project
pan stuff in my empties just because I
don't want to show it to you guys a
million times when I update you'll see
it in every single update in the neff I
put it in empties too I just don't want
it to get too repetitive so all this
stuff here is new products that you
probably at least you haven't seen in a
project pan and I feel good I've used up
quite a bit of stuff and let's get into
the video first thing I have Battiste
here this is my favorite dry shampoo
this is in the scent floral and flirty
in blush this is one of my favorite
scents I love all of them though I would
take all of them it's just the best dry
shampoo I love it definitely recommend
this is another hair item this is the
redken for men mint clean shampoo me and
Sam both used this I just wanted to use
it up it had a really minty feeling so
when you massage it into your scalp it
did kind of refresh you and wake you up
I feel like it stimulated the blood flow
to your scalp and everything I did
really enjoy this I think it cleaned my
hair well and i would i would get it
again if it was a good price but I'm not
gonna go search it out if that makes
sense for shower gels I have this
cashmere glow shower gel by bath and
body works I love both the body works
shower gels they're my favorite shower
gels they just feel so luxurious they
feel like they're moisturizing but not
to moisturize where you feel greasy I
just love them the way they said
everything about them but this one the
scent of it I did not like I bought this
in the store and I have actually the
matching sugar scrub in this too i
bought this in the store and I thought
oh this is a different scent for me this
is a little more sweet a little more
musky it'll be nice for winter I just
didn't like the way it going like it
grew on me the scent just started
smelling really nasty to me it's not
like
medicine our cherry it just wasn't good
even see them didn't like it so I will
not be getting this scent again but I
know a lot of people like it I just for
me I like fresh or fruity not this so
you know not the scent this is that
matching sugar scrub again the scent of
it I don't like I do think that these
sugar scrubs work nicely this is one
that kind of leaves an oily residue on
your skin so personally I do not like
that feeling so I will do this first and
then i'll use my loofah and use my
body's wash after this it's a nice
product I would purchase this type of
product but just not this scent from
bath and body works I actually have to
hand soaps to show you guys this one is
the soft soap pomegranate and mango hand
soap i bought this because we had just
moved in we hadn't unpacked stuff and we
just needed a soap for the bathroom and
I did not like it the scent was okay but
it just was so slippery it would slip
off your hands before you could really
rub in the soap or anything I did not
like that about it even Sam didn't like
it so I will not be repurchasing this
again and the other soap I've used up is
this one this is Copacabana coconut this
smells so good i bought this one we came
out here just randomly because i was
like we moved to California let's have a
tropical scent um but I did really enjoy
this scent and bath and Bodyworks opes
are my favorite they have little beads
in them I just think they work so nicely
and I didn't realize how much I liked
them until I use that soft step one and
I realize ooh I don't like that I'm used
to a different texture and a different
performance level so i will definitely
be continuing to purchase these ones i
think they're great if you can catch
them on a deal I don't think they're too
expensive and I think they're worth the
money that you're paying for them so yes
i love this i also used of two candles
this month i'm super happy about that my
candle collection video went up a link
it down below but this one here is
oceanside so this one really grew on me
i didn't like it at first um I mean I
liked it but I didn't love it and then
as we kept burning it when I'd walk in X
melody even that wasn't burning and I
really did enjoy the scent it was very
clean but still sweet scent it's a nice
one I would consider repurchasing it
probably not this summer maybe next
summer or something like that and then
the other candle I finished up is lemon
mint leaf this one was tough to go
through i did not like it it was just I
just wanted it done so bad so I'm so
glad this one's done I do enjoy the
scent it is exactly that lemon and mint
but it was just I was just done with it
it was I was over it I was so over that
candle so I am so glad that that one is
done and I can move on to other sense
especially because I am totally ready to
burn spring and summer a tropical and
fruity sense right now so I really want
to burn someone's I love instead of like
ones I just feel like I hate you why do
you have to be in my life I have one
makeup item and then the rest of
skincare so I'll guess I'll go through
the makeup I have this eyebrow pencil by
Maybelline this is the definer brow oh
this is the define a brow in dark blonde
or blonde i bought this at walmart it
was like five dollars and change and I
thought hey what if this is like a dupe
for the Anasazi one and I do really like
this pencil I think it's thin enough
there's a swatch of it there um it's
quite a thin pencil and I think it's
great especially for the price i will
probably repurchase this over the
Anasazi one just because of that the
only thing is this does the house bully
it has like a little brush like that I
don't use this at all I don't use this
part of it at all um so I wish it came
with this bully but it doesn't I just
think the price on this is so much
better you can get four of these for
basically the price of one Anasazi one
in performance wise I thought it was
comparable so i would definitely check
this out if you're looking for a dupe I
know that nyx is just come out with one
I think elf has a new eyebrow pencil so
a lot of brains are coming out with
things are comparable that I haven't
tried but this one I have and I did
really like it I definitely would
consider repurchasing this especially if
you're in a pinch and you just needed
something fast you can go to any
drugstore and they're gonna have this
whereas elf or Knicks are only sold at
certain places so I really liked that
skin care I used up these
cotton rounds they're all tied so sorry
it's kind of ghetto but I it's a really
long tube and so I had to reach so far
in so I I you knowed I wide a little at
I there to stop that from happening
these are from costco but they are just
like cotton brand cotton rounds but it
looks like up and out brand but it's not
i got them my costco i thought maybe i
just get them up I don't know where I
got these there are 100 cotton pads in
here I have been trying to get better
about using less cotton pads on my face
so I do use one for my eyes 14 like
bioderma type of product to get my
makeup off I then cleanse my face and
then I use one for telling us or try to
use only three a night which is a lot so
it goes pretty fast I really enjoyed
these ones I like ones that are kind of
in almost a casing I don't like this
whispers or Swiss peas or whatever those
ones are they get little particles like
stuck in my lashes and just around my
face and I just don't like them so as
long as they have like that most of them
come like and say they're exfoliating
those are the ones I like and these are
like that so I would definitely purchase
these I have my last pack of these
neutrogena pink grapefruit acne
cleansing wipes these were okay I did
get used to them into the second pack so
potentially I'd repurchase them I just
feel like there's other things out there
that I like just as much or better so I
don't see why I would go back to these I
like the Burt's Bees ones and those are
the ones i would say i like the most if
i had to pick but i have been trying
again to be better at doing my skincare
routine and not even use wipes at all
and actually i cleanse my face so i'm
trying to resist buying towels for a
while just because i know that i'll just
get lazy and only use these and not wash
my face with actual water so um but
these were okay i mean if you were
interested i would check them out you're
not gonna like regret it probably but
just know that they are acne so you
can't even further your eyes or you'll
burn them out and um but if you have
acne prone skin this might be an option
for you this is the number seven
beautiful skin oil free makeup remover
and I bought this because it's like a
water it's not an oil it's not even like
a to product thing that says its oil
free this is like a water and I thought
it would be comparable to bioderma so I
bought this before i bought the
simple one I think this worked really
great it worked just as well this was
799 though for this small of a bottle
and I just I can't pay that price I went
through this and maybe a month it went
so fast and the simple one is bigger and
699 so I would not repurchase this but I
do think the product performed well this
is the kodaly grape water spray this was
nice I used it whenever I got out of the
shower and you did I would just spray
this on my face or when I was washing my
face and toning it I put this on I
thought this was okay I don't have any
complaints with it but I also don't
think it was amazing or did anything
super special for my skin I do think
it's better than the Evian one because
it is at least great water and not just
water but it's not something that's
essential in my skincare routine and I
wouldn't repurchase it I just bought
this and it came in a set when we were
in France so that's why I have it and
I'm glad that I used it up and got my
money's worth but I would not repurchase
this okay guys those are all my empties
I feel great to be moving product out of
my collection especially the candles
yeah mostly the candles some skincare
stuff as well that's always great and if
