empties video I did run about a month
ago and they have some new products that
I want to show you that I've used up
basically just my trash and I want to
just point out to you with my empties I
don't like to put anything for my crutch
pans in here this is all separate stuff
unless it's something in a project pan
that I didn't use up in like the due
date and then I finish it afterward all
included in here just to show you guys
that I used it up or like share that
progress with you cuz I wouldn't in any
other way if I didn't if that makes
sense
umm but yeah let's get into it this one
I have a lot of products on the verge of
being used up so I know my next one will
also have tons of stuff in it but let's
get into this one and I'll show you guys
what I have the first thing that I give
here the first thing that I have here is
this baffle Body Works coconut water
chill Shan ranch shower gel I used this
up it did not smell like coconut it
smelt like a jolly rancher or something
it definitely was way more sweet and
fruity but it was okay I like the
bathroom Bodyworks shower gels I think
they lather really nicely they feel
really good and I go through these
really fast just because I do use a lot
of product on my loofah I like it to be
like said city in my shower I just
really love to embrace the Sun so this
is all used up it was okay but I
wouldn't repurchase the scent but it
wasn't bad yeah I have cute hand tips
here from Bath and Body Works as well
this one was Island nectar I didn't
really care for this scent um it was
okay it just smelled like fruiting and
tropical but nothing really special so I
probably wouldn't like repurchase this
one and then this one's peach Bellini
and I absolutely love peach Bellini I've
had quite a few of these this is like a
favorite when people come over and again
my popular hand soaps this one's a
favorite but um you know again I
mentioned this in one my other empties
videos I can't decide whether I like the
foam or the regular soaps better these
ones you have product left over and if
you add like water it gets really thin
and it'll score you like those dinosaurs
on Jurassic Park but I like squirt out
the venom or whatever that's what will
happen with this and they'll get like on
your shirt and it's soap and it just
sucks but I feel like the foam ones go
faster than these ones so I can't decide
I'd go back and forth I usually get like
half an
but yeah use it up anyway I would
repurchase that scent I love that scent
I'm just gonna finish up the bath and
Bodyworks stuff this is a travel sized
coconut-lime breeze travel mist from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and again you already
know all that stuff because I said it
already this was a good scent yeah I
liked it I kind of just again got over
the scent and I'm glad it's gone I'm
glad it was just a travel size and I'm
moving on to other ones and different
projects and stuff so this one is gone
thank goodness I probably wouldn't
repurchase that when I didn't this is a
dry shampoo this is the Tresemme Fresh
Start volumizing dry shampoo I have had
this before when I first started using
dry shampoo but this is what I was using
and it worked it just doesn't work as
well as batiste
so I was using this and then I used
batiste only like exclusively for so so
so so so long and then I come out here
and I can't find batiste anywhere oh I
haven't been into Ulta because I'm
trying to be really good but at Target
at my local grocery store those are all
places that I feel like you can normally
buy it not here so we went to a CVS and
I saw it and I got like two so now I
have like a million dry shampoos anyway
that's a long story but this one I don't
like this one I don't think it works
well it doesn't make my hair look on
greasy it doesn't make my hair feel good
like nothing about this works like I can
handle a little bit of a gritty texture
because I wear my hair up anyway when
it's like dirty but this just leaves a
dirty texture on top of it not even like
looking fresh or anything so it's just
not worth it
and I don't think it's like one of the
super super cheap ones maybe it is I
thought it was like six something still
and at least that's what I think I paid
for and that's not that cheap you know
it just doesn't work don't get this and
if you like it I'm glad it works for you
this is the clean and clear dual action
moisturizer I bought this before for me
and Sam and this is the second one we've
gone through I really enjoyed this
moisturizer this is not something if you
have dry skin that you're going to want
to really use because one it has
salicylic acid in it so that's going to
dry your skin out a little bit and it
also is just a very
like formula I like using this in the
daytime before I put on makeup I think
it's a great base for it it doesn't make
me feel oily and I don't think it makes
me Willie throughout the day on top of
that it does have like acne fighting
salicylic acid in it which is great
especially if you're breaking out and
Sam really likes this one too for that I
definitely would repurchase this one
again I yeah I really like it I think it
works nicely it's not that expensive
either I thought I think I thought for
like three something at Target so yeah I
really like this one have your purchase
would repurchase I don't know why but I
have a lot of like teeth stuff so we're
just gonna go into that you want your
teeth to be beautiful as well as your
the rest of your face right well this
doesn't even have a thing on it I know I
tipped off I think my mom brought this
and then we used it all up this is like
a Glade one glide one maybe it's glide
um it was okay it's not my favorite but
it was okay this is like a travel size
of the Colgate Total in clean mint I
really like the taste of this one it was
nice and it was travel size my mom also
brought this and left it here and we
used it up and yeah it was nice I liked
that I would get the full size although
I am working on quite a few other ones I
think I bought like a big pack from
Costco so we have like a lot of
toothpaste for a really long time
now this toothpaste is probably one of
my favorite ones I've ever used this is
the Melaleuca whitening tooth polish
this is like a spearmint flavor but it
also kind of tastes like Melaleuca oil
which sounds like it'd be bad it's
definitely an acquired taste because
when I first tried this it wasn't my
favorite but it just is a very clean you
feel like your mouth is definitely clean
it's not full of like sugar mint
it's like clean mint and I really like
that about this I think it works really
well it doesn't sets up a ton in your
mouth which I'm kind of fine with I'm
kind of used to that with like the
whitening toothpaste I feel like they
don't do that as much but yeah I really
like this toothpaste I definitely would
consider like getting more of these ones
who finish up what we have but this is
one of my favorite ones that Sam really
likes it too comes in like a cinnamon
flavor and other ones too so this is a
really great one if you're looking for a
toothpaste maybe try this one it's
really good I have used up a razor here
this one isn't up enough
and one and it has like the jelly around
it not like super big not like the
intuition ones but just enough and it
was really great I usually don't invest
in like a nice razor but these ones are
really nice it came in I think either a
four or five pack and I really I really
like it I think it works really nice
especially for like your underarms or
you shake that like every single day you
don't have to actually use shave cream
at all you can just use this and it has
that goo on it that kind of and it
really does work and gets on your armpit
so you don't get like razor burn or
anything like that and it just is like a
smoother surface for the razor to go on
this is really great and I wasn't
expecting anything super major from it
but I really like these so I'll
definitely be repurchasing these once I
use up my other ones I have a couple
makeup items here this one here is the
bare minerals original foundation in the
color fairly light this is just like a
sample sized one I used all of this up I
feel great about that this is a nice
foundation I think it works nicely
personally I don't know if I would
repurchase it I have a full-size of this
in my drawer right now plus I think even
like a smaller mini of this and yeah
it's okay I don't know if I'd repurchase
but I do enjoy them and it's not like a
product I hate using up I thought I
would show you guys that I did use up my
benefit Porefessional this is the huge
one it's a 1.5 ounce which usually think
those normal ones just a 1 ounce and
it's all gone I used it up it didn't get
finished quite by the finish seven by
spring but it is now gone and I'm on to
other primers and different projects so
that is awesome I felt really good about
this even though it's sad because I did
really like this one but it's also like
a huge accomplishment
so that is gone I would definitely
repurchase this one but I am on the
lookout for like trying to find my like
perfect primer so I can just have one
primer instead of a million I'm trying
out just one that actually does it all
for me and I don't have to think about a
primer and like switch it up I just have
one that just works that's what I want
so this is on my radar of one but I'm
kind of going through what I have and
then also just like once I finish those
up which ones I want to try and then if
this one wins and I'll repurchase it if
not you know it's a good one but not my
hopefully that makes sense I used up one
of these back bodywork so I guess I
didn't put this with the rest about the
motor works hello this is a little
Wallflower this wasn't a something like
apple cranberry or appletini or
something Apple it was not good
it smells like fake sugar I don't know
why I purchased this and I did not like
it I think just didn't like it
Oh every time I went up to where this
was burning I just I just smelled like
fake sugar like a fake Lee sweetened
Apple drink with a little bit of a berry
or something it's just not good so don't
get the sentence or if you like it good
for you
I completely finished up my Coto Lee
hand cream this is the hand and nail
cream and I absolutely love this it
smells so so so good it works so well it
was in my favorites video I'm so sad
that it's all gone I really want to get
the full size but I'm not going to until
I finished all my hand creams because I
got a billion hand creams I don't know
what happened to me where I went hand
cream crazy but I did and so once I
finish up all those other hand creams I
will be getting this in the full-size I
think it's like $15 at Sephora but it's
worth it it just is just such a great
product I really like this if you're
looking for a hand cream I definitely
suggest this one maybe try to get a
sample or test it out at Sephora because
they do sell it I looked it up but um
yeah it's really good I really like this
I used up another up and up brand cotton
rounds these are like the hundred pack
and I really like these I like these
because they're in like a case where
it's not just like straight-up cotton
it's like inside a little like
exfoliating case if that makes sense
those are the only kind of like I don't
like the Swiss be zorse whispers but I
don't like those at all they get little
cotton fuzzies on my eyelashes then they
get in your eyes and they just fall
apart I just don't like them but these
are great
I've repurchased some sense I like to
get my cotton rounds for a dollar for a
hundred that's just me because I use a
lot of them and these are a little bit
more expensive than that so if I found
other ones cheaper that's what I would
go for because these are like two
something I think and that's just
annoying to me
I want to pay a cent a thing that's just
the price that they should be so that's
done in the last item I have here is
something actually Sam used up but I
thought I'd included this is the men's
department forming paste and yeah it's
all used up he's is this on his hair
sometimes all I used it on my hair too
just to kind of give it some separation
or tame flyaways or anything like that
he just uses this to give his hair a
little bit of shape after the shower and
so it's just not limp that's what I use
it for and he liked it it's not like you
won he'd repurchase but just a forming
paste and journalist something he likes
to have and also I think that's great
for me just for those flyaways even
though sometimes I just don't care
they're just whatever I don't have time
who can be bothered not me anyway um
yeah those are all my empties items I
hope you guys enjoyed my trash and I
will see you in my next video thanks for
watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
