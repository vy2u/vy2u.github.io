video while I'm sitting down this is
going to be my empties number 4 I can't
believe I already have this many empties
I was trying to do it kind of monthly
without calling it like April empties or
anything but I've collected a lot of
products really recently so I thought it
would just clear through these ones so I
don't have a super long video and then
as soon as it gets like filled up again
I'll just show you guys what I have so
it might be more than every month it
might be a little less than every month
it just depends on how fast I'm using
things up so let's get into the products
that I've used up on my trash oh my this
is a reoccurring item this is the target
up-and-up grande cotton rounds the
regular ones these ones were 105 count
instead of a hundred count for 5% more
but these are more expensive than the
100 count so I feel like it's not like
I've saved any money for getting 5 more
cotton rounds again I like these ones I
just wish they were a dollar I wish they
were cheaper so as soon as I somehow I'm
able to find cheaper ones here I will
snag those up instead of these but
they're good I finished up a nail polish
remover this is 100% acetone I like
using 100% acetone I know that it can
definitely like strip the nail and strip
your cuticle and like dry out that area
but I do that so yeah it's just faster
if you have glitter on it's just easier
that's just my personal preference so
that's what I do and I liked it I mean
it was just a stone not a big deal this
is something I'm just getting rid of
because I feel like it's expired this is
the kroger brand which is like Fry's
brand if you live in Arizona only I
don't know anyway
Fry's brand is sheared right at
sunscreen it's SPF 55 I got this I think
maybe last summer or the summer before
that and I just know SPF expires so I
don't want to be using this thinking
it's giving me some protection when it's
not so I thought I would just get rid of
this and just get an actual sunscreen
for now instead of using one that
potentially is expired so I'm just gonna
toss it that way my skin is actually
being protected and not being damaged
because the Sun damages your skin is
super horribly bad I have two hand soaps
we are still washing our hands this is
the bathroom body where
eucalyptus mint and this is the foaming
soap I like the smell of this it's very
clean but it's like still a little sweet
it's really nice I really like this
scent so I'll definitely probably
repurchase that and then this one is
just the regular soap and this one is in
endless weekend this scent is okay to me
I liked it when I first came out but now
it's just not anything that special so I
probably won't just like buy a ton of
these soaps again I'd rather buy just
like limited edition ones that come out
with the summer if I'm gonna go for a
beachy scent or go for something else I
finished up a croaker eye makeup remover
this is one that was like a dual one
where you like shake it up because the
product separates um it was okay I I'd
rather use like my simple like cleansing
water then use this just because this
does leave like a little bit of an oily
residue and that's just not my favorite
I like my eyes to be very clean I don't
want any like residue and I'm just now
trying to be used up I creams and even
though it was like irritate my eyes in
the sense that like when I wake up in
the morning I have like Krusty's which
this is like TMI so I'm sorry but I've
like Krusty's like in my eyes like the
the moisturizers are kind of like rolls
into my eyes it's only I can describe it
as I'm sleeping and so I can just feel
like I'm kinda like that feeling so this
I feel like just would add to that so I
don't know I just though cleansing water
works for me so that I think I'm just
gonna stick with that instead of getting
another like makeup remover this is the
Neutrogena pore refining toner this was
nice this is very harsh
it definitely has like alcohol in it you
can definitely tell yeah it's like the
second ingredient I don't think I'm
gonna repurchase this only because I
want to try like more gentle toners I'm
the type of person that does like to
feel the tone in the sense that it feels
like stripping and like it feels like
not burning but kind of burning I like
that feeling but I think there's just a
lot of other toners out there I'd rather
just use like straight-up witch hazel or
now that I'm working at this store try
stuff out like spray toners - I really
want to try out just I'm not using stone
cotton rounds and I can kind of save
some of those and not use as many that's
something I'm thinking about doing I
probably won't repurchase this but it
was nice especially if you'd like that
type of like harsh toner and I don't
know if it like helped me with my pores
or anything but yeah it was okay I'm
just you know going in a different
direction this is something new this is
like new to me brand wise this is Kate
Somerville oil-free moisturizer I got
this as gratis from my store and it
wasn't full it was like a tester and
they just replaced a tester so they let
me have it so that's the product there
you can like unscrew the cap to see how
much you have because it is like let me
show you what it looks like it's like a
pump like that and you like push down on
it and it comes up so anyway um I got
this home and I smelt it and I just felt
like it smelt bad I just
I even had Sam smell it and he said it
smelt kind of gross - and then I tested
the stamp oh I don't know I just don't
like the smell of it I don't know what
it's about I don't know if it's actually
bad I kind of don't think it is because
I smelt the tester at the store and
that's like a newer tester and it smells
very similar it smells like it's spoiled
Omo so I think that that might just be
something with Kate Somerville I've
heard like some of her goat milk stuff
smells weird so I don't know if it's
just something like that let me know if
you have like a similar thought down
below in the comments but I just don't
feel comfortable putting it on my face
it's not worth it to me um even though I
want to use it because this is an
expensive product but it just smells
gross like I can't get over this smell
so mmm
sadly this one is going to go this is a
body wash this is from um Melaleuca this
is in the scent ocean breeze Sam's mom
got this for me like so long ago and
it's just been sitting in my drawer I
have just so so many body washes like I
stopped up so many times during
semi-annual sales and got them for like
$2 a piece with coupons because they're
$3 and blah blah blah and I have
probably like I don't even know like 50
plus mm not 50 that's insane
thirty that's still insane but yeah so I
used this one up this wouldn't really
fast besides even though it looks like
it's a big bottle and this F was okay
it's just a little too clean for me I
like them like clean but still sweet
like floral and sweet not like just
clean um but it kind of grew on me in a
good way as I used it but it's all gone
it was okay I wouldn't like go out to
repurchase this or like recommend it it
was just say alright I have this simple
cleansing water in here this one is
really great this is in one of my
favorites videos and I have a new one
that I'm almost finished with now and
I'm gonna repurchase it once I finished
that one so I definitely love this this
is like a great product it's really
comfortable to Bioderma to me and it's a
lot cheaper and easier to get so yeah
that's a really good one
oh shoot I have another hand soap in
here - sorry guys this is the Pacific
cool breeze hand soap this one smells
okay it was um
more of like a clean Beach scent yeah
like a cleaner manlier Beach Sun it was
nice I wouldn't be opposed to getting it
but I'm not like running out to get it
again I don't think they have it though
I'm pretty sure they don't have it it's
from a couple it's from last summer I
have a shampoo and conditioner by Aussie
this is the awesome volume shampoo and
this is okay um I definitely feel like
it volumizes but it also volumize in the
sense that it tingles my hair I feel
like a lot of shampoos that say they're
gonna volumize they just end up like
making my hair almost unmanageable and
then I have to use a conditioner in the
whole reason I use this was so that I
could get volume and one epic
conditioner in my hair personally it
gets rid of any volume and ways my hair
down so um that was a little annoying
but I mean I find that a lot of them do
that so it's not like this one
specifically that doesn't it the thing I
didn't like about it with the packaging
it is really hard like I'll show you it
is really hard to open it and when
you're in the shower it's like I don't I
don't want to like break a nail or
something to open up my shampoo so
packaging wise it in like you know I
probably won't repurchase it I'll try
different volumizing shampoo or just
other shampoo from the drugstore
as for this one this is the Aussie 3
minute miracle moist like it's like a
leave-in treatment in the shower so
you'll put it in in the shower for like
three minutes and let it sit and then
you rinse it out I didn't do that I used
it as just a normal conditioner and I
only put it I only put conditioner and
the ends of my hair from like my ear
down just because my hair gets greasy so
fast and it's so fine and thin that if I
use a conditioner I find that I can't
get as much wear out of my hair as I
could if I didn't anyway
so it was ok I love the smell of it it's
not like coconut in the beach and that
was nice the packaging was kind of cool
it like opens on the bottom like this is
where the hole is but that's also where
it sits and you just squeeze it out I
think if you really needed conditioning
it'd be ok um you know but it has like
probably like a ton of silicones and it
and bad stuff probably just coats your
hair but I don't know it felt ok I
wouldn't be opposed to getting it again
but I wouldn't necessarily like go out
and buy it either I have a lot of
conditioners I need to use up anyway I
won't be purchasing stuff like that for
a long time this is a body scrub no this
is a face scrub by Neutrogena this was
the pink grapefruit foaming scrub I got
this in a pack from Costco with this in
two of the and two of the wipes that
came with it in the same set there like
the grapefruit wipes this smell was ok
it's not like grapefruit but like
medicine grapefruit it was okay to me I
just don't think this scrub was super
effective I'd rather have the same eyes
if I'm gonna go drugstore and then I
also got I'm getting a lot of gratis so
I'm thinking about doing like a monthly
gratis video of like items I get either
from brands or because of testers and
kind of like not just showing you them
like hauling them but instead like doing
um not like product knowledge but just
like telling you about the product and
whether I like it or whatever like many
reviews or something let me know if
you'd want to see that in the comments
down below like I'm not trying to like
brag on what I got I just think it's
interesting and it's stuff that I
be honest like if I pay for it or not
but I didn't like get it sent to me for
review it's like from just where I work
and anyway let me know if you like that
down below but this is okay I wouldn't
repurchase it though
it just didn't scrub enough for me I
like a lot of scrub it's like a lot of
scrubbers in my scrub so that way it's
like really getting in there I don't
feel like there's just a couple of
little beads I'm trying to like move
around I'm telling you I used up a lot
of stuff I'm really really proud of
myself I have like a little sample here
this is a soy fresh soy face cream I
didn't use this up I was gonna use it
and it it smelt bad so I didn't use it
so this is just like mmm I think went
bad which is so sad but it's gone and
I'm gonna try to use up a lot of my
little sample packets really really soon
as soon as I can
I'm gonna kind of switch up how I do my
sample roundup so that I can get through
more samples and see if that helps me so
that I don't have to throw a bunch of
them out because it's nice to try the
product know if you like it before you
bite you don't have to return it or
anything like that and if they're going
bad I just feel like I wasted money or
product someone else could be using you
just feels like a waste overall so um
that's something I want to work on but
anyway I'm going so off track I'm so
sorry guys this is total ease hand soap
in Mal d'avin I don't know if it tastes
it it did not smell good to me it kind
of smelt like cinnamon but floral it's
the same formula the formula was nice so
I liked that about it it's the same one
as like my favorite one which is just
their normal hand and nail cream it's so
amazing it smells so nice and it's just
a nice light formula but anyway it was
same formula just the smell is not my
favorite so I went through this I have
been doing so well with hand creams I'm
so proud of myself I've been using them
every night and I've been getting
through so many of these like little
those little hand creams that I have
been like hoarding almost I don't know
what my problem is
I used up this it's a 10 miracle
leave-in product this is like a sample
size I went to a hair show with my mom a
long time ago like probably two years
ago and they gave us a bunch of it to
ten products and this was one of them Oh
No maybe this was just a gift from my
mom like it came with when you purchase
something else maybe it wasn't from that
I don't know either way um I used this
it was nice I felt like I couldn't use
this so like oh my roots I couldn't
spray it on my whole head I had to keep
it in the bottom part of my hair which
is normal for me but I like my Moroccan
oil better than this so if I'm gonna
purchase something that's gonna
basically like conditioned my hair and
like make it easier to brush through and
manage I'd rather use that than this so
I'm just gonna stick to Moroccan oil and
that's what I'm using now and I love it
it's so nice it smells amazing it just
works in the hair I don't even use the
light version is the regular one and it
doesn't weigh my hair down it's just
amazing if you haven't tried it
definitely like try a sample size or
like the travel size they're less
expensive I know it's an expensive
product to think on our story song for
like 43 but it's so nice it's so good
this one's kind of random this is just
like a lighter
oh look and now it lights of course
anyway this is like a fire lighter oh
yeah there is some in it it wasn't
working for me I don't know I'm gonna
try to use the last bit of it then but
this I just used to light my candles
I've been using matches since this has
been out but I can't believe it works
hah lies I'm lying to you I didn't use
that one up that isn't used up the rest
of the stuff is all I can make up II and
one of the items I don't have in here
and I'll just tell you what it is
because I keep it I'm still gonna keep
it and use it so I used up the lip
butter that was in my finished seven by
spring this was in the Jasmine scent
it's the Korres lip butter and it's all
gone I'm so happy I finished that up I
have quite a few more of these to go I
have a guava one I have another Jasmine
one I have a pomegranate one and I have
like one other one it's like insane so
I'm just gonna work through them and I'm
glad it's done I felt really great about
getting through the
and even though it wasn't finished in
that challenge it's now finished which
is still a success this is a brow pencil
from Clinique this is the superfine
liner for brows in the color 0-1 soft
blond I did not like this pencil I
thought it was too ashy for me um and
not dark enough like it wasn't dark
enough and then I was also ashy it just
didn't work I didn't like it I also felt
like it was no product at all I went
this I went through this so so fast
and I feel like I use other brow pencils
like I'd rather have a dark color I use
less of because I like kind of disperse
it dispersed less through my brows then
use this and go through it so fast
especially because I think this is 16
dollars which isn't bad for like a
high-end liner or I'm sorry a high-end
brow product but it's just too much
money for what it is and the color is
just not my color just everything about
it plus the tip of this kept breaking
off which I don't know why that is I
found that this is like so similar if I
had to pick a dupe I would say like the
packaging everything about this is
exactly like the Maybelline one and like
the green packaging like this but I like
the color of it better it's only 5
dollars and change at Walmart and it's
just better but both of them this one
and that one the tip will break off if
you like roll it up too much so that's
just annoying anyway I was a wasting
about this product before my camera shut
off and in the carpus fool
I just won't repurchase this I don't
like it that much I'm done talking about
this product so it's over another brow
product this is the anasazi Beverly
Hills brow Wiz and this is the product I
was saying I wasn't gonna go get but I
wouldn't got it it's all gone and this
is in the color dark brown I'm keeping
this inside my makeup drawers for the
spoolie I really like it - ooh / dirty
but um it's a great spoolie I think this
is a way better like product if you're
gonna go high-end I would get this one
instead of the clinic one definitely but
I'm gonna just use up brow products that
I already have in my drawers and I've
just been less like fussy with my brows
lately one I just don't have the time
into a weary work it's very
as much as we sell a lot of makeup
products a lot of the people wear very
minimal make-up very like let your skin
show through we sell a lot of their
really expensive skincare so we like to
focus on that as well and so I've just
been kind of feeling weird about wearing
a lot of makeup and so I've just been
going more natural overall and same with
my brows so anyway enough rambling I
finished those up don't like like the
brows there are two more products left
this is a liner by Urban Decay I was
gonna use this liner I don't know why I
went through and found this but this is
the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in the
color perversion and the cap was not on
this all the way it was like really
loose so this is completely dried up I
can't even like swatch it oh I can
barely like I had to you there's just no
way you could use this it is so dry it
like moves around inside the pencil part
so I have to get rid of this it sucks I
have a whole nother full one because I
bought the Ocho logo and the Ocho logo
too which is like a pencil set of eight
when they came out for the holidays I
think this last holiday season in the
holiday season before and I believe
perversion wasn't both of them so I have
another full one but it just sucks
because black is what I use the most of
and it's gone and it's just an expensive
liner I wish I could have used it up so
I went through and I made sure all my
caps we're on
and you guys should to make sure your
caps are on these because if they dry up
you can't use them and it sucks
in the last product here this is my
Christian Dior creme de Rose lip balm
and I just finished this up last night
there is no product in here I was
working on finishing this up when I was
in Arizona and then I lost it and then I
found it again so once I finished that
Korres one I just started working on
this because I was so close to being
done this really only had like a ring
around the edges and this is now done so
I'm gonna be working on even more lip
balms and I used this every night before
bed I thought this is an OK lip balm I
honestly don't think that it's worth the
money I know a lot of people love this
lip balm it's their favorite lip balm I
think it's good I think it works
I like the rose scent it's ok I just
think there's a lot of other lip balms
out there and
like the fresh one because it's in a
tube and I can use that by my bed I can
use that in my purse and this because
it's in a pot I could only really use it
by my bed without feeling nasty about it
so that's just something plus like where
I work there every branch has a lip balm
like Jurlique has a lip balm you know
nukes or knucks oh how are you say that
has a lip balm there's a lot of lip
balms I want to try so I would
definitely purchase those over
repurchasing this one and I feel like
potentially they're gonna be just as
good if not better than this one so why
why buy this one again the packaging
though that's the reason okay guys that
is everything for this video I'm sorry
if it was really rambley but I don't
know what happened I will see you guys
in my next video I hope you're having a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
