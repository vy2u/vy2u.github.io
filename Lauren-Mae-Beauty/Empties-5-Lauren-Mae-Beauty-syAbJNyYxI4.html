it is that time of the month I have a
ton of empties for you I've been using
stuff up like crazy so I thought I would
go through what I have and Shaggy's my
trash and tell you if I'd repurchase or
not that is everything let's get into it
I will try to do most of the makeup
first I don't know how much makeups in
there but i'll try to do it first well
this is makeup related this is a brush
cleaner this is says NBS brush cleaner i
got this in my kit and i am all done
with it basically it was just kind of
like a spot treatment to use spa
treatment it was like a spot cleaner so
when we were doing makeup on each other
we would do it on ourselves and then we
do it on the other person so this would
clean it in between cuz we didn't have
time to like deep clean so it was okay i
probably wouldn't repurchase i have a
little mascara here this is benefit
roller lash mascara i hope this was ok i
didn't think it was absolutely like the
most amazing thing ever but i did enjoy
it if I had another sample or something
I'd use it but it wasn't like I'm not
going to spend 20 something dollars on
it so I know a lot of people liked it
but I felt like it just never dried he
kept my lashes kind of sticky I finished
up a face powder by Maybelline this is
the fit me powder in 135 creamy natural
I'd like this to use under my eyes I
couldn't use it all over the face though
cuz i would be so greasy by the end of
the day like so greasy grease all over
the place so i would like to using this
under my eyes which i did enjoy it for I
think the powder itself is really nice
if you have like drier skin you probably
would love this product but it just
didn't work for my skin type but um I
used it I think this is the last like
actual makeup item a lot of my makeup I
don't put in here if it's like in a
project pan and I finish it out because
I don't want to show it a million times
so I have these eps and makeup stuff but
it's just in different areas so this is
a little ben nye cream foundation color
it's in the color white and we use this
in theater to highlight so it's all gone
I've cleaned it out and I have another
one so I know it's kind of weird when I
don't use it in my everyday life but i
did use it up in school so i'm probably
going to include any time i use
something up in my kit in here too just
to show you guys my stuff
I have two different makeup wipes here
these are the skin light ones there i
think a korean brand or something there
the cucumber one anywhere nice these are
only a dollar ninety-nine when i got
them at the korean market which i
thought was amazing for 30 of them i
would definitely repurchase these i
thought they worked really nice for what
they are especially when i'm being lazy
so yeah these are the realest still ones
i got these at work and I like them a
lot there's 25 in here and i believe
it's eighteen dollars I probably
wouldn't purchase these I think they're
great if someone else is wanting to
spend 18 dollars on on some wipes and I
would tell them these are nice but I
wouldn't myself by these now when I can
buy the other ones for a dollar
ninety-nine no way I have two battiston
here I love Battiste this is the clean
and classic original this isn't my
favorite scent but yeah I love the
cheese so I used up two of those it will
be in like every empties video now
here's a product I didn't use up but I'm
throwing them in here this is the LA
vanilla healthy deodorant in just the
original scent and believe vanilla I
have a small size which is this one I
have a big size I just didn't like these
and I don't know i don't know why they
think they smelt like Sam Sam just
called me to warn me they're going to be
going on our balcony and making noise
while I film of course so um if you see
any of that or hear any of that just I'm
sorry I'm warning you know where was I
oh yeah the deodorants um I don't know
what it is about these I just didn't
like them they didn't work for me that
and keep this end I want to retry them
though I just want them to work so badly
I want to try the vanilla coconut one we
just carried started hearing these at
work so i might try to do that but these
i think just have dried out on top of
though it's because i didn't use them
when i got them so then when i put them
on they like hurt my armpit to put them
on so i'm just done I'm done keeping
them around just because I wanted to use
them at one point because if they just
don't work anymore and I didn't like
them originally so I'm just getting rid
of them I will probably retry though
this isn't like makeup or beauty or
anything but these are anti-acid tablets
I like the mint ones and I have really
bad heartburn so I pretty sure it's like
acid reflux status by
um I use these a lot and again mint is
my favorite if you didn't know now you
know and if you don't know now you know
body wash I have the essential black
currant vanilla body wash from Bath and
Body Works I really open so close maybe
that's better I thought this worked
really nice and I really like Bath and
Body Works you guys know that and the
scent was niiiiice Sam didn't like it
though he kept being like what do you
smell like he didn't like the smell it
is a little bit more muskie and I
usually don't do that but I thought it
was nice especially for winter i might
repurchase this I might not I don't know
I could see myself going either way I
have a face mask in here this is the
Dead Sea minerals mask its anti stress
from Freeman it was ok um I didn't think
it was absolutely amazing or anything it
was super blue I was scared it was gonna
seriously die my face blue because it
died my hands blue but it didn't so that
was good um I probably wouldn't
repurchase though I have to hand soaps
this one here is the pair and would
cider I really like this sent it was
nice and then this is Caribbean escape
they're both from Bath and Body Works
and this one is okay it's not my
favorite scent but I probably would
repurchase it if it was like a five for
eighteen deal and I needed one more I'd
get this sent again but I wouldn't like
rave about it's not like my favorite
scent ever oh they're about to get on my
balcony I have to hand creams I've been
going through hand creams I'm so proud
of myself this one is the locket on
Fleur sherry I got this in Paris when we
were there and I finally used it up so
that one's done it was nice um it was a
lighter weight formula than their like
Shay one then I use this hand came up um
it's called natural Mandarin Lauda's
Pettis by the brand blue cue I think I
got this off of all cosmetics wholesale
so I don't know it was an i sent it's
funny because I didn't like the scent
originally but now I do and I think it's
cuz I'm slowly starting to kind of like
how loud can you be I hope you guys in
here yeah um I used to not like you know
these natural more natural lighter sons
and now I am because where I work that's
mostly what we carry and carry me you
know that's the phone
nothing so but I I did enjoy that sent
as it went along I have my simple my
solar water cleansing water I really
like this you guys know that i would
definitely repurchase this i will as
soon as i am in need of it this is kate
Somerville's saito sell a dermal
energizing treatment i use this is kind
of like a serum and i didn't use like
the full size of this i just got it was
like we're changing out the tester and
it still had some minutes so i used it
up what was left i really enjoyed this
and like the texture of it I mean I
didn't notice it doing something
absolutely amazing just overall I like
the way my skin felt and looked while i
was using it so if i had one hundred
fifty dollars to just blow i'd buy this
but I don't this is a drugstore
moisturizer this is Sarah v's skin
renewing night cream now this was like a
matte texture on the skin so I wanted
this because at night I wanted some
moisture but this did not moisturize at
night it was kind of like I don't know I
could just say like a matte feeling I
definitely wouldn't repurchase it I if
you're looking for something maybe
you're really dry you can even use this
in the day I don't know it was way
different than I thought it was going to
be for like a night cream I have my
target little cotton grounds here I
think this is my last one of it now i
just have dollar store once and they
suck so i'm probably gonna go back to
these because i haven't found anything
better yet another hand cream i didn't
see this in here this is a lock suit on
um twenty percent shea butter hand cream
in the scent subtle violent i really
like this unto this it was really nice
this was the thicker kind of formula
than that other one so it was great I
really i've been enjoying using hand
creams especially at night because if I
don't I mean I can't imagine my hands
with just like flick off into the wind
and I have another Sarah view product i
bought this at the same time as the
other one this is the renewing skin
renewing cream serum this i also it was
just okay I liked the packaging because
it's like a pump but it's also in like a
squeezee tube so that was nice but I
wouldn't purchase either of those so I I
don't know I didn't like him it was a
bust I have a razor this is just like a
sheep Quattro venus razor
no it's nice i like the ones with like
the blades and the pad and stuff it was
just time to get a new one i bought them
in a pack of five and i still like three
left this is the Colgate Total whitening
toothpaste I thought this was okay um I
like the Colgate no I like the crest one
better but I bought a costco pack of
these so we have like four more to go
last but not least you have some samples
this is a real Estelle sample this is
the micro moisturizing fluid I used this
in a daytime I thought it was okay it
worked nicely for a daytime because I
could put my makeup on top of it and it
wasn't too heavy so that's good i have
found with really still that they're
just not super moisturizing products
like they don't give if you were a dry
or even normal but wanted a ton of
moisture i don't think they would be
absolutely amazing for you this is the
melvita nectar rose um mask no
moisturizing Rose nectar I don't know it
has an expiration date on the sample
pack and so I'm getting rid of it
because it's expired I have an
anti-aging cleanser from peter thomas
roth sample this was okay it didn't
smell like peaches like I wanted it to
but it was okay and then I have another
hydro tensor moisturizing cream has like
Carla hyaluronic acid in it from really
still again this just didn't work
amazing so you know I wouldn't
repurchase that that's everything I'm
sorry this video is kind of rushed i
just am on my way to work and then these
guys and you know so i hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if you've
done empties recently or if you tried
any of these items in the comments and I
will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
