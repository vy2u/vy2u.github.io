Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing an empties
video I'm gonna be showing you all the
products that I used up in the month of
February and let you know if I would
repurchase them if I like them if I
didn't I don't have a ton this month I
feel like it's a little bit lower than
normal but I'm excited to show you what
I have used up and it's always exciting
to me to be continuing to move things on
my collection and use things up and
actually get my money's worth out of
some products so one other thing if you
like this look I did do a demo of it in
my boxycharm video so if you want to see
how I did it you can check that video
out so the first thing that I have in
here is from batiste this is their dry
shampoo I get my net Marshalls and I was
so excited when we went in this whole
big bottle costs $7.99 instead of $9.99
which is what I was paying before at
Marshall's for it I think that is such
an amazing price this bottle between me
and Sam lasted about a month so I think
that's a really great value but jeast is
my favorite drugstore inexpensive dry
shampoo and then the only other one that
I found that I actually like is from a
Moroccan oil and that one's a bit more
expensive so when you're on a budget
this is what we use
I like the floral smell it's not my
favorite like that's something I wish
batiste would work on I know they have a
lot of sense but none of them are my
favorite right now we're using the wild
child one and I do not like it it's very
like musky and it's just so overpowering
so I cannot wait to get through that one
I don't know why I tried that one I know
I like the scent of this one and I'm
pretty sure I've tried that one in the
past and not liked it so I don't know
what I was thinking but this one the
floral and the blush are the two that I
tend to get often because I enjoy those
sense the most out of what I've tried
but you guys have seen that a million
times you guys know that I love the
petite I do have a few foil packets in
here this one is the bio peel gauze
peeling lemon thing it's from neo gen
lab I've had this for a really long time
it was just a single-use exfoliating pad
and it was fine I don't think it smelt
like lemons which was something I
thought it would but I feel like for a
product like this you have to use a
multiple times see if it actually is
making a difference on your skin I will
say the pad was a lot bigger than I
thought it was going to be so that was
definitely interesting it seemed like
just more quality than I thought it was
gonna be so I could see the price being
worth it I don't know if it's a
I'm gonna pick up but it was nice and
the other foil packet that I have in
here is from josie maran and this is the
whipped argan oil body butter and honey
supple and vanilla I used this on Sam's
back because he's just been really dry
and I wanted to try this scent and see
what it was like I want to try the
consistency of this product and I didn't
like the scent I didn't like the
consistency I mean I don't know why I
didn't think it was gonna be oily since
it's like you know argan oil and
everything in her line has to do with
argan oil but it was definitely an oily
product it did sink into the skin but
it's definitely not something I would
purchase I'm very picky when it comes to
lotions and Sam didn't really like it
either so yeah it was a bust for us I
would not purchase this I forgot to
start with makeup so sorry guys I do
have two products once an actual empty
one is something I have to get rid of I
did finish up the Lancome tint you doll
Ultra wear makeup stick I was using the
shade 110
I've waar and this is a cool toned color
I did like dig out all the product in
there because I would say about half of
the stick that you get is actually in
the bottom of it so if you like this and
you have it definitely dig it out you
will get like double the use out of the
product I know this is expensive I did
receive this from octa Lee but it's
something that I really love I'm wearing
it today I just love it it's so nice for
easy days I love that it has SPF in it
it's something that I think I'm gonna
pick up when we go to Italy and we're
travelling just because it's so easy to
apply I can blend it out in like two
seconds
I feel like it lasts on my skin nicely I
don't get overly oily I don't know I
just I'm really enjoying it so this is
definitely something that I'm missing in
my collection I'm not quite done with
the little jar I'm pretty close but I
know once that's gone I'm gonna be like
well shoot what am i use so yeah this is
something I really really enjoyed and
the other makeup product is a foundation
from Hart candy it's the glamoflage
invisible camouflage foundation I have
it in the shade porcelain I bought this
as a mixer foundation and I I was doing
a series like trying 5 first impressions
from the same brand I only did a couple
of those videos but this is way too late
on its own so I was like ok I can mix it
but I feel like the consistency of this
has changed I wasn't really a fan
this foundation on its own it wasn't
super full coverage but it was mad I
don't know I just isn't my favorite so I
did like it as a mixer to like lighten
things up I'll probably just use
whatever also have in my collection if
it's lighter or even like drops or I
don't know something else I won't
purchase this again I have some cotton
rounds that I've used up these are these
whispers ones that I enjoy I did use up
another simple cleansing water you guys
know I use this up quite often I use it
to take off my eye makeup and enjoy it
some more products that are always in my
empties these are the fel aloe vera face
wipes these are my absolute favorite
face wipes they're so good they're a
dollar at Big Lots if you haven't tried
these yet and you want a good face wipe
that isn't going to be expensive these
are amazing
I highly suggest them I've used other
ones and they're just not as saturated
they don't get off my eye makeup as well
like I just love these they're great for
nights when I don't want to wash my face
I've been doing a really good job of
actually using water and soap to wash my
face but on nights when you're just
tired or it's late or maybe you want to
get off the first layer of makeup and
then go in with a cleanser these are
really nice and they do a great job for
such a low price I have another product
in here I have to get rid of because
it's expired I did have this in my
project use it up and I thought I threw
it away but I didn't I put it into my
empties which is why I couldn't find it
but this is the derma e purifying
two-in-one charcoal mask I do like this
product and I wanted to use it up it
only has like half left in it and you
kind of need a lot and I don't know but
I wasn't able to get to it before I just
felt like it went bad it still has a
little bit of time on it with the
expiration date but I just felt like it
was a little separated and it just
wasn't worth it to me I know this
product is getting older and I just
decided to get rid of it so I put it in
my empties I didn't actually throw it
away yet but now I will this is probably
my favorite item in this whole empties
this is the Bath and Body Works
exfoliating hand soap and it is in the
scent ice blue sage I loved this I loved
the actual product and I loved the scent
of it oh it smells so nice and
refreshing it's not overly like manly
like you would think
iced blue sage would be so good I really
wish this wasn't limited edition I wish
it was just a part of their regular line
but sadly it's not the exfoliating part
of this was really nice as well it just
gave your hands a nice
refresher every time you used it it kept
my hands soft throughout the winter as
well so highly suggest this I wish I
picked up like two or three other ones
because I go through hand slips so often
it's okay for me to have backups of that
I talked about that product in another
video and so many of you guys were
saying you loved that specific hand soap
as well so it's not just me that one is
like exceptionally good I have a
toothpaste here this is the crest
complete multi benefit extra whitening
with scope this is fine but I did switch
over to quip so I have a put brush that
I got from octiline and I ended up
ordering Sam one so now he has one and I
really enjoyed the toothpaste for him
that too when we used up a whole one so
when I made the order for that I think
we have we're using one now and then we
have at least one backup if not two of
them right now so um yeah I really like
that toothpaste better than this so I
won't be purchasing this I also got my
mom to get the quip and she's really
enjoying it as well I have a couple of
hair products next this is a detangler
it's just a mini size from what and I
use the wet brush to brush my hair when
it's wet I don't have a lot of hair it's
very fine it's very thin but it gets
tangled so easily so when I get out of
the shower that's like one of the only
brushes I can use when my hair is wet
and not damage it so anyway with that
story I was excited to try this out
because I love the brush so much and
this is amazing I really enjoyed this
detangler it did a great job at
detangling my hair and making it easier
to run my brush through it without
weighing my hair down which I feel like
is the biggest issue since I don't have
a lot of hair and then on top of that I
think that kind of like seals the deal
for me is the smell it smells so nice to
me it's very similar almost to that ice
blue sage it's kind of manly but not too
manly it has like a little fruity
something I would use this as a body
soap I would use this as a candle like I
just enjoyed the smell so much so I can
definitely see myself purchasing the
full-size of this at some point it's a
product I have a very very fond liking
of but I do have an it's a 10 that I
need to get through and I have a whole
Moroccan oil so it's not something I
really need but it's great I really
enjoyed it I have yet another puff me
this is a product that you spray into
your hair it's a powder but it gives you
a lot of texture and volume I love using
this on first-day hair what I need
little bit of something to get a bun
going and then Sam uses this also to
have that kind of grit and texture so I
highly suggest this I think it's really
nice it's a little bit pricey like it's
a high-end hair product but I think it's
worth it and I enjoy what it does to my
hair I've gone through room at least
over six bottles of this stuff I
finished something up from away this is
the treatment masque and I have this in
my shower and was just kind of using it
as a conditioner I can't really use
masks like my hair just gets it's so
heavy and my hair just doesn't really
need it for the most part so I don't
really have any opinions on this I
wouldn't use this I wouldn't buy this I
just wanted to kind of use it up since
it was just a small size I do like weigh
products though I love their finishing
cream that's something I actually keep
in my makeup kit and it's a repurchase I
had the sample and then I purchased the
full size because I liked it that much
so I do think some of their products are
good I just don't really care about this
product for me specifically and then the
last hair product this is from Sebastian
and it is a dry shampoo it's just a mini
I was keeping this because I felt like
there was a little bit in it I just
wanted to use it up so I went to use it
and it actually is used ups oh yeah this
is just a long time empty hanging around
like it was it trashed when it was I
don't really like this dry shampoo I
feel like this is more of a texturizer
than a dry shampoo it gave me way more
texture and just kind of felt gritty in
my hair than it did actually soaking up
the oil so it's not something I would
repurchase but my mom really likes it so
if your hair doesn't get like extremely
oily you might like this as a dry
shampoo but I need something that's like
going to work and cleaning up my scalp
because I get so oily and I don't have a
lot of hair to soak it up
and the last 2 products I finally
finished up this mini from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this is the Paris amor fragrance
mist I do not like this scent anymore
it's a little too just heavy for me yeah
I don't really like it so I'm glad it's
gone I will not be repurchasing the
scent it's just not fresh enough for me
and then I just have a tiny baby mini
this one is from Beauty Blender and it's
their liquid cleanser I really love the
beauty blender cleanser I've repurchase
it multiple times I think it does an
amazing job of getting out the makeup
your beauty sponge I have tried
dishwashing like what I have tried the
products that I've used on my makeup
brushes it's just the best at breaking
down the foundation so I will continue
to repurchase this I love it
I think it's worth it and that's
everything for my empties guys I really
hope you enjoyed I love doing my monthly
empties it's almost like a favorites
video like that's how much I love it
they're kind of like tied but anyway I
hope you enjoyed the video thank you so
so much for watching guys and I will see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
