Lauren thank you so much for watching
today's gonna be an empties video I'm
really excited because these are one of
my favorite videos to film because I
love using up products
I love rotating through items in my
collection and actually getting use out
of the stuff that I have so these are
all the items that I used up in the
month of March and we're gonna start off
with some makeup because I do have a few
of those also this is a new camera so
it's like way different for me and the
lighting setup everything is gonna have
to like change and I was finally in like
a routine with my last camera so
hopefully it looks good it should be
like way more in focus because this has
autofocus and it's like newer my old
camera was just old and I had to do
manual focus it was just a whole big
thing so hopefully you guys like the
quality of this better I'm gonna
hopefully get the lighting worked out
and situated so that way we can get into
tutorials again and everything so yeah
I'm really really excited anyway moving
on to the actual empties video the first
item that I have here is from Too Faced
this is the hangover 3 and 1
replenishing primer and setting spray
I've been mentioning this in a few of my
other videos and I really do like it I'm
really considering purchasing the
full-size of it because I enjoyed it
that much this was only a 1 ounce bottle
so it just was so small I went through
it in about a month of consistent use it
smells like coconuts which is really
nice it's kind of like a medical coconut
scent I know that's weird but that's how
I describe it but after using the entire
bottle I did get used to it and do enjoy
it so I definitely want to pick up the
full size of this at some point I do
really like it and I think it's nice for
my collection I have a mascara here and
this one's from Tarte and this just like
the whole top broke off I don't
understand why that happened I feel like
this has happened to one of my other
Tarte lights camera lashes mini mascaras
too so that's just frustrating I did get
quite a bit of use out of this but
definitely not nearly as much as I could
have if it hadn't have totally busted on
me this is a nice formula I like the
brush and I like the wand it's a bit
drier I have enjoyed this mascara in the
past and I do like it I just wish I
would have gotten more use out of it but
yeah it's
good one if you were interested I
definitely suggest trying out the mini
hopefully it doesn't bust on you though
I have a brow pencil in here this is my
favorite brow pencil well I use a combo
so this is one of my favorite brow
pencils this is from colour-pop it's the
brow boss brow pencil in the shade
blonde
it's the newer formula so this is very
similar to honest aziz like brow wiz
this one isn't as creamy as their other
brow pencil that they have I don't know
what that one's quite called but this
one's really nice I love the color
because it's light enough for me to do
the inner part of my brows without
making them too deep I don't have this
in my brows today I'm testing out some
other products I'm not really keen on my
brows today but I do love this I think
this is the second one I've used up in
full but I have two backups and I'm
using one currently so I have
repurchased I do love it it's really
great and the last makeup item that I
have here is actually not an empty I
just I just need to get rid of this this
is from Maybelline and it's a you guys
can actually like see now look at this
what okay anyway that's like a big thing
for me anyway this is just old and
getting dried out so it's just time for
it to go I was using this in my kit and
now I took it out and it's time to get
rid of it
I think specifically that gel eyeliner
is fine I'm not like married to it
though so I would definitely try out
other ones before that I want to try off
the Mac one I want to try out the Inglot
one those are on my list so I would try
those out before I bought that one again
and now onto the rest of the stuff in my
basket off the top here I have a batiste
this is the sassy endearing wild petite
I got this at Marshall's for $7.99
I love batiste I think it's great you
guys know this already about me
specifically I don't like this scent
it's just a little too like a colonia
was just excited to get this done I feel
like this smells like one of those
scratch and sniff stickers that's oh
just gross I don't like it
I'd like the tropical one the best and
then I think I like the blush one second
best so definitely suggest this it's a
great dry shampoo and I love that I can
use a lot of it Sam can use a lot of it
and we can go through and fast but it's
so affordable that it's okay I do
have a few wipes these are the FPL aloe
vera cleansing tissues you guys know
these are my favorite I get these at Big
Lots I actually just went to Big Lots to
pick up a couple more of them when I say
a couple I mean like 15 packs because I
buy them in bulk when I go to Big Lots I
love these so many of you guys have said
that you've tried these out and you love
them too they are super saturated they
smell nice they take off all my makeup
but they still feel really gentle so
highly suggest these that are
inexpensive but I will say I've been
doing an amazing job of actually using
cleanser to take off my makeup so I use
these more for like I makeup or if it's
like a quick thing I don't use these
every single day so I'm really happy
about that
I used of two different hand soaps this
month they're both from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and this one is one of my all-time
favorites it's the marshmallow pumpkin
latte and it smells so good we had a
friend come into town for just a second
and I specifically put this out for him
because I know he loves the Sun and he
was very appreciative of course he
commented on it cuz I know him so well
so yeah this is one of my favorites I
think I have two backups right now and
then when it comes to fall I will get
more backups because I love it so much
it's like the only sweet like bakery
type of scent that I actually like and
the other scent that I have is the
bergamot waters and this is actually
really nice as well I've used up a
candle in the past of the scent too and
this is something that I think works
really well for a unisex scent something
that's going to be a bit more subtle I
feel like a lot of Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
scents can be like really overpowering
super in your face which sometimes is
really nice but if you're looking for
something a little bit more low-key and
not offending in any way I really
enjoyed this this reminded me of the
sage the ice blue sage scent of that
hand stuff I liked during Christmas time
so I definitely suggest this if you're
looking for a scent more like that this
one it was really nice I enjoyed the way
it smelled on the hands and it wasn't
too overpowering
another Bath &amp;amp; Body Works item I think I
have one more after this we'll just get
through all of those this is a shower
gel in the scent endless weekend I
really enjoyed this I thought it was
really nice I don't know if I went in I
would like buy this again it's kind of
tropical let's see it says that it is
bustling with fresh summer Mandarin
Sunkist Magnolia and raspberry lychee
sorbet
endless weekend is a really good
description of it I'm happy with it and
then I also did finish up a Wallflower
you guys I literally only have three
more of these left and I'm so excited
after they're gone I will never purchase
a Wallflower from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works good
and I'm so freaking pumped it's been a
long time coming I've been working on it
for a long time I believe the scent that
we had in there on this one was warm
vanilla sugar and it was nice it was
fine I'm just so ready to get them gone
I just prefer a candle I love the
ambiance of that I love having like the
flame and the way it smells and
everything just so much more than these
so I have such a small apartment it
doesn't matter I just need one or the
other so I will not use these again
after I finish them
speaking of candles I do have a candle
empty this one is from scent bird and
it's the Siberian fir and cedar wood I
really enjoyed this candle and I
repurchase this was sent to me
originally from Sanford but I was going
on the website and I saw that they were
doing a deal which was amazing because
my biggest point about these products is
that they're just a little expensive
I believe this candle retails for
twenty-two originally but if you do the
subscription you can get it for $15 and
I ended up getting two candles for like
28 for a one-time purchase without the
subscription so I thought that was a
pretty good deal that was with shipping
and everything so I've got another one
of these and then I tried the blackberry
Earl Grey and blackberry which smells
really nice as well so the reason I like
this so much the scent throw is really
nice it burned for a really long time
this is a very tiny candle and I was
nervous this was gonna burn out in like
two seconds but it really does have the
40 hours of burn time on it and I was
really really happy with this so I'm
really glad I picked up two more candles
I'm gonna kind of save those ones until
I burn through a couple more if the
candles that I have that I know we're
just like old I need to get through them
and then I'm gonna burn those as a treat
because I do really like them this is
I'm seriously going so random through
these empties the next one here is from
dove this is the dry spray deodorant I
really do like this it's definitely a
lighter deodorant so if you have like
some stinky underarms you really need to
take control I don't think this is going
to quite do it for you I love that you
can just easily spray this on though
it's easy to like touch up your
deodorant if that's something
you're interested in or think would work
for you but I got mine at Costco in a
4-pack and I really like it I would
definitely repurchase that and I love it
for my makeup kit because it's easy and
sanitary for anyone to use if someone
needs deodorant on set I have a huge
brush cleaner here this one is from
cinema secrets and I do like this it's
it's this one and the Birman studios I
think is what it is
Berman industries I don't know it's the
one from Namie's I like both of those
but I do find that this one has been
getting out like the gunk in my brushes
when I'm doing quick cleans the best so
I have been repurchasing this this is
probably my fourth one I have a new one
open right now so I highly suggest this
if you're looking for an easy fast way
to clean your brushes in between deep
cleanings this is so nice it's not only
going to get the pigment out but it does
sanitize it as well so yeah I really
like this it dries super fast and it
smells like vanilla which so many people
comment like well your brush is smells
so good so that's a plus another kind of
cleansing product this is the beauty
blender cleanser I love this for
cleaning my beauty blenders it's all I
use to clean them I have tried so many
things I've tried like dishwashing
liquid because I was like oh maybe
that'll break down the product nothing
just melts the product out of my beauty
blenders as well as this does I think
it's worth the money especially if
you're gonna already invest in a beauty
blender I think if you want to keep it
clean this is a great way to go and also
because I use Beauty blenders in my
makeup kit I want the best thing for
them and this works amazing ivory
purchased this probably three or four
times highly suggested it's amazing I do
have some cotton rounds here these are
from Swiss purrs I got these at Costco
as well I think that these ones are
really nice and I really probably will
only ever purchase those cotton rounds
because I've tried so many that just
suck and just poof all over and they
really suck I really want to try this
just data ones I think I'm gonna buy
them during the sale I'm not like doing
a sale video or recommendations video
seriously my favorites for Sephora just
they stand true and I'm not someone who
normally like will really go hard and
buy a bunch of things during the sale at
least that's that's just not how I've
been the last couple of years I just buy
things when I actually want them I don't
the sale to like really influence what
I'm buying it's great if there are some
staple items but for me I just I don't
want to just buy things to buy them
because they're on sale anyway I think I
might buy those cotton pads though just
because so many people rave about them
and I am very picky about my con round
so I kind of want to see what all the
fuss is about
we still have a couple more things next
I have some iPads or what are these
hydrogel eye masks from number seven
these were really nice they were a these
weren't too thick or too thin I thought
they were like a nice in-between they
stayed on my eyes well so yeah I enjoyed
them they just stay on for like 10 to 15
minutes so it's not like a super long
time with these honestly I've never seen
super brightening effects super
tightening effects I really just see an
increase in like just moisture in the
area as well as a bit of deep puffing so
that's what I use any type of like
hydrogel eye patches I masks for I do
have a few oral care products in here I
have two flosses these are from Coco
floss and I did get these sent to me
from octoly this is the fresh coconut
scent and I really did like this one
this is my favorite one out of all of
them because it does have that like
scent of coconut I've talked about these
a couple other times on my channel I do
like these but this is a very expensive
floss these retail for eight dollars a
piece which is very very pricey Sam's
already told me he does not think
they're worth eight dollars I'm more on
the fence this is a more robust floss
which I really enjoy it really feels
like it's like getting all the crud out
of your teeth I just don't like how
there's not that much product in here I
really wish you got like double the
amount of product at least because we
went through these pretty fast I mean we
were using a bunch of different ones at
the same time because we were testing
them all out err I was and so Sam just
was grabbing whatever was there this one
is the mint one just so you guys know
and we ended up finishing both of these
in about two months so I would say about
one of these with last is a month of use
for two people and that's just so
expensive like I don't know if I want to
spend $8 on floss every single month
that's just a lot of money for me I
think the real test for me will be after
I'm done using these and I go back to my
old floss that I used all the time if I
will miss these and if I miss these and
I think it'll be worth it but yeah I
really did enjoy them while I have that
and if you were interested I think you
should try them out well just finish up
with the rest of the teeth type of stuff
I do have some Crest Whitestrips here if
you watch salmon eyes Costco haul then
you will have seen that we bought the
different pack so currently we're doing
the one where you like do it every
single day for two weeks
and then it came with the pack that also
is like they're really deep cleaning to
our one just to like get your teeth back
to that place anyway so we've done it
twice and yeah I'm hopefully will have
whiter teeth that would be amazing and
I'm excited for that and then last four
teeth stuff I have a quip toothpaste you
guys know that I really enjoy this I got
the quip toothbrush and toothpaste sent
to me from actually and then I liked it
so much that I got Sam the tooth brush
and then I bought a couple more of the
toothpaste so we're using another one
right now this is the second one we've
gone through my mom also bought it I
really enjoy them I feel like my you
know teeth brushing game is like stepped
up a notch and I just I like the taste
of this toothpaste specifically so I
highly suggest it if you're looking for
one and this one's pretty affordable I
think it's like five dollars so that's
awesome this is the last skin care
product that I have its from Saturday
skin and it was just a like a daily do
mist this is just an expensive product
if this was like ten dollars or less I
would think like yeah it's not that bad
but just for the price I didn't see that
it did anything amazing honestly it's
just like any normal like miss he gave a
little bit of hydration it was like
refreshing I didn't see any differences
than if I was just spring water on my
face
honestly also the smell of this was just
kind of man you know wasn't good at all
so if it had a good smell I could at
least be like yeah I would do it but I
don't know it was just okay there's
nothing wrong with it but there's
nothing amazing about it especially
again for that price I think it's like
in the $30 range no and that was also
sent to me from octiline second to last
item here this is the puffy volumizing
cloud miss you guys know I talk about
this in every single empties this is a
spray powder that you put in your hair
to volumize your hair it's a volumizing
powder Sam is the one who mostly uses
this product but I do tend to use it
when I first get out of the shower like
first day hair it gives me some texture
and grit so I can actually put my hair
into a bun and it has like you know some
volume and isn't
like sticking to my head because I have
very fine thin hair highly suggest this
we've been through at least ten of these
like we've gone through a million and
last is something so tiny but I've had
this since before I moved to LA so I'm
just happy about it this is the West
Valley Vision Center it's just their
specific like glasses cleaner and I've
had it for forever and I finally used it
up and I'm so proud I'm someone who's so
bad at cleaning their glasses i frickin
I don't know why I just like I hate
doing it I hate that I have to clean my
glasses but I went through that finally
it just took like three and a half four
years no big deal
alright guys so those are all my empties
I really hope you enjoyed the video just
you know hopefully it will inspire you
to keep using up your stuff because it
feels so good to like get it gone try
something new or repurchase it if you
really love it I just like keeping
things fresh in my collection I like
trying out new things and it always
makes me feel better when I know that
I'm actually going through products as
well thank you so much for watching guys
and I will see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
