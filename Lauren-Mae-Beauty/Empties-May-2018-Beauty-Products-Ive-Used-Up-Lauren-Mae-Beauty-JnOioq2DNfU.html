Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm gonna be sharing with you some
of my empties these are products I've
used up in the last month and a half I'm
a little off on my empties so they're
not quite monthly empties right now but
I'm hoping to get back on track once I
get back from Italy because I am in
Italy right now so if you want to follow
me on Instagram definitely go follow me
there I also have a tutorial on this eye
look coming it might be up it might not
I will have it linked down below and if
it's already up it'll be clickable and
if not it's coming so I'm pre recording
and I don't know why schedule if you
can't tell anyway let's get into this
because I have quite a few makeup
empties actually or like things I
consider more makeup be and those are
really exciting because those are always
so hard to use up and when you finally
finish them it feels like such an
accomplishment so let's get into the
items I've used up I have two of my Holy
Grail eyebrow pencils here that I used
up at the same time one is the brow boss
brow pencil from colour-pop this is in
the shade blonde it's one of my all-time
favorite pencils it has a very thin tip
and I love the color of this for the
inner part of my brows because it
doesn't add too much color
I have very fair brows naturally and so
I don't want the inner portion to get
too dark and it's easy to go kind of
overboard and this pencil stops me from
doing that I've purchased many of these
these retail for five dollars on the
colour-pop website and I highly suggest
it if you have a fair browse like I do I
want to mention that the spoolie on the
back does tend to like come off with the
cap so as soon as I get this I take off
the clear plastic cap that's on this and
I just never apply it again because it's
it sometimes can make this bully come
off but that's such a small problem to
me that the pencil is worth it the price
is worth it but I wanted to mention it I
love this and I've repurchased many many
times and then the other brow pencil
that I have is from ELF
it's the instant lift brow pencil in the
shade taupe it retails for two dollars
and it's amazing this is a creamier
formula than the colour-pop one and I
use this on the outer portion of my brow
so the tail and kind of like the arch of
the brow this is just such a great
pencil for two dollars I highly suggest
checking it out they have three
different shades I feel like most people
can find a color that will work for them
I feel like the taupe is pretty
universal it's a little bit dark but if
you go light handed you
definitely use it if you have fairer
eyebrows love this if you've been here
for a while you know that because I have
had it in a million empty next is a lash
glue this is the duo dark tone lash
adhesive and you're probably wondering
like what Lauren you never wear lashes
how did you go through a whole lash glue
and that's because this is in my makeup
kit this is the one I tend to prefer to
use when I'm applying lashes on other
people because of the fact that it has
that dark tone to it the clear one tends
to dry like not quite clear and so I'd
rather have black because usually I have
at least some type of darker base going
on so that the lashes look more natural
and yeah so this is the one I prefer
although I do have the clear one for
applying anything else that I might need
to like rhinestones where I don't want
like a dark glue popping out and every
purchase that multiple times as well I
have a mascara here this one is the
benefit roller lash mascara I got this
in a mascara sample set from Sephora and
I really really liked it sadly I threw
away the freaking certificate to get the
full size but even then I still feel
like the kit is worth it because these
minis last you so long I really enjoyed
the brush on this it's like a curved
wand it has some like longer bristles on
the curve and I felt like I could really
wiggle this into my lashes get some nice
separation volume and coverage without
it getting spidery and it just gets so
close to the base of the lashes which is
something I really liked I also really
like the formula of the mascara itself
because it kind of stays flexible
throughout the day so you don't have any
of those like crispy lashes which I
really like and last four items I've
used totally up I have two lip balms
here which is like a really big
accomplishment the first one is from
Revlon it's the Revlon kiss balm in the
tropical coconut which is one of my it's
my all-time favorite one I feel like for
the price and everything it's just so
nice I use this up in a project and I
could not find this tube but I knew I
hadn't thrown away because like no Sam
knows everyone knows that if I empty a
product it goes into the empties not the
trash but yeah I wanted to show you guys
I did finish this up it's all the way
gone so proud about it I love this
though it's kind of like bittersweet but
I'm going to definitely repurchase this
as soon as I use up some more lip balms
in my collection
and the other one that I held up earlier
is from nukes it's the Reeve de Mille
lip-balm and this isn't a tub and I used
this at night for about a year and a
half it took me to use this up and that
was with pretty consistent use I feel
like there were some times where I would
use other things but I mean overall for
about a year and a half this step by my
bedside so I really like this lip balm
but I don't think I would repurchase it
because I like the lineage lip sleeping
mask better this one just kind of stays
on the lips and kind of creates a mask
like when I wake up it's definitely
still there but I just prefer the way
the lineage one moisturizes so it's not
a bad product I just found something to
replace it that's better and then last
year for kind of like the makeup items
for me these are things I didn't
actually use up but they have to go so
the first one here is from Stila this is
the glitter and glow or whatever they
called magnificent metals glitter and
glow yeah it was right this is in the
shade diamond dust it's the full size I
had this in my kit and this was like
drying up and I recently used this on a
gig and then because it was so dry it
was hard to like apply it to my hand and
then apply it to the girls lips we were
actually putting it on the lips for like
a two second thing so I just ended up
applying from the tube and then I was
like I'll just throw it away because
obviously that contaminates the product
since it was so dry so I am throwing
that out I have an eyeshadow primer here
from Maybelline it's the master prime
long-lasting eyeshadow base this is
basically gone but to me gone means like
I've used every last bit of it so I
won't be putting this in my yearly
empties because if I took the stopper
out I could still get product I know so
many guys are like it's fine whatever
but that's just how I am it's my project
panning background coming out alright
anyway I really did enjoy this product
it's just I've had it for about a year
now I have other ones in my collection
that I use over this so it's just time
for it to go this reminded me a lot of
the by Terry hyaluronic eyes shadow
primer I've used that before in the past
this has like almost like a moosie
consistency and I did enjoy it it did
keep my shadows from creasing but I
don't think this is as long wearing if
you have like major issues with creasing
I wouldn't try this out but if you just
need something to kind of like even out
your base a little bit and just make
sure
don't stay a little bit longer you know
make sure there's no creasing if you
don't have any major issues I think
you'd like this it does have a bit of
shimmer to it too but I didn't find it
to be like an issue at all anyway and
the last item here this is from
colour-pop
it's the cream gel liner in the shade
exit which is a white eyeliner I did not
like this product because of the fact
that it was just faulty the eyeliner
pencil as soon as I got it basically
broke off it broke off multiple times I
kept trying to save it putting it back
in here and it finally fell out one too
many times I'm like I'm done with you so
there's nothing in here to me the sad
thing is that formula wise this is
actually a nice pencil I feel like it's
opaque it stays in my waterline really
well but because it doesn't like last
and you can't really use the product
it's not worth it to me so I would not
repurchase this I don't suggest it it
was a failure and I would only try these
pencils again once they reformulate
which hopefully they will because
they've gotten rid of a ton of shades we
are now on to the big ol basket here I
have a lot of face wipes and I think
it's because of my kit as well as like
just finishing off a couple of packs
that were like half used but I always
like to mention these because they're my
favorite these are the FPL aloe vera
cleansing tissues these are a dollar at
Big Lots so go to your Big Lots and pick
them up I always buy them in bulk like
at least 15 packs at a time they get off
makeup they're really saturated they
smell nice they don't burn my eyes like
there are so many positives to these I
love them so much ov you are a cheap
wipe girl don't like to spend a lot of
money on makeup removing wipes whether
it's for swatches or whatever you use
them for I absolutely love these they're
so good I have a hand soap here from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works there is no surprise
there this is the lavender a birch one
this is a little bit different than what
I normally would pick up but there was
like a really good sale last year that I
picked up a ton of different ones this
smells really nice it smells like
something I would like to spray on
myself but for using it over and over
again on my hand I liked it like once
but I didn't like it like over the
course of the whole time using up this
entire bottle so I wouldn't purchase
this scent again actually even though I
do like it when I smelled it right now I
was like yeah that smells good but
there's just something about it being on
the hands over and over that irritated
me and I didn't enjoy so yeah I mean
soap wise it was great but smell I would
get something different I have two
different dry shampoos here the first
is Moroccan oil you guys know I love
this so so much this is the light tones
one they also have a dark tones if you
have darker hair and don't want to have
a great cast this smells so freakin good
it works so well it is pricey but it's
like my luxury splurge item that I love
so much and works so well I'm using one
currently if I'm in Italy because I
saved one for the Italy trip because I
love it it's just my favorite I also
love batiste though if you want a more
drugstore affordable option but the
other one that I've used up is from
Sephora this is the coconut water dry
shampoo I picked this up because I love
coconuts you guys know that and I was
like you know what I want to try this
out it was eight dollars for this little
tiny thing I thought this was gonna be
like a normal sized dry shampoo so
that's why I was willing to spend eight
dollars but I'm like this is a travel
size like this is so tiny I went through
this so fast yes it smells like coconut
it smells nice but I feel like it smells
whoa let's bring my camera I feel like
this smells pretty similar to the
tropical one from batiste
I like this scent slightly better than
that one but I mean they're close enough
where there's no way I would pay the
money for this I thought this worked
fine but it wasn't amazing like just not
worth the price and I feel like it's
kind of scam me that it's so tiny
for the 850 or something that I paid for
this I definitely should have gotten a
full-sized bottle of dry shampoo another
hair product here this is the viral
celeb luxury extreme hot pink color wash
if you guys want to know how I keep up
my hair this is how I do it I really
need to get my roots done so bad but I
can't before Italy so it's gonna be it's
gonna be a while guys since we're
growing about it's a little a little
volley Iser what is that what was it
ombre I don't know was that being all
the Kardashians we're doing doesn't
matter anyway
I really love this product because it
dyes the hair as you shampoo so you use
this in the shower this does tend to
stain my hands a little bit but by the
time I get out of the shower I feel like
it's pretty washed off you just have to
work really fast with it I squirt out
quite a bit in my hand put it on my hair
and let it sit while I do other things
and then wash it out this makes having
colored hair so easy to keep up because
that's the biggest thing if you guys
haven't had colored hair let me tell you
if someone has consistently beautiful
colored hair
they are putting in work and putting in
time at the salon let me tell you this
is a bit pricey on its own I believe
it's like in the 20-ish dollar range but
it saves you so much money going to
salons and can actually keep up the
color that you put in so highly suggest
this I have been through multiple
bottles of this because I love it I have
to my seller waters here they're both
from simple ones just the huge size and
ones the mini size I do like this a lot
but I have been using my pur Lisse
cleanser so I feel like I haven't been
going through this as much and these I
was just on the last legs like I had a
little bit left I basically used this up
though in about a month I do really like
this product I don't know if I'm gonna
repurchase it because I'm getting to the
end of like this huge back stock I had
because I bought a bunch at Costco
because it was an amazing deal
I like the Garnier one I have a Bioderma
so I like just in general micellar
waters because they don't leave a greasy
film on my eyes or on my skin and that's
why I like them but I do have one makeup
remover that was a bit greasy this is
the Elizabeth Arden all gone iein lip
makeup remover I got this in a kit again
from Cusco I love Costco and I just had
this hanging around because whenever I'd
put a liquid lipstick on which is not
very often when I needed to get it off
this definitely did the trick more than
in my cellar water or just like makeup
wipes that weren't like really gonna
break it down with oils this was fine I
would never purchase it though yeah it
was just something I wanted to get gone
in my collection the next product I have
here is from scent bird and this is the
nourishing sugar scrub in coconut and
sugar I did get this sent to me from
sent bird and I liked this product I
love that it's in a squeeze tube I
really did like this scent although it's
not like your traditional coconut scent
it's kind of like a sweet coconut scent
like if oh my gosh
it just went like all over me kind of
like if you were to get like a coconut
snow cone or something I don't know how
to explain it anyway when it comes to
the sugar scrubbing particles I thought
this worked pretty nicely it was a
denser scrub which was nice I just feel
like it's a little bit expensive for how
much you're getting and how long this
will really last you if you're using it
very consistently you get 8 ounces of
product or 150 milliliters and I believe
this retails for $18 on the website so
it's
not something I would repurchase I do
have a whole review of this and a lot of
their other products besides their
perfume subscription if you want to
check that out I will leave a link down
below in the description but yeah it was
nice while I had it but it just is a
little bit too pricey for me another
product that I got sent because of
actually from number seven is the early
defense glow activating serum I thought
this product was pretty nice I had a
serum from number seven before this that
I didn't quite enjoy like I liked it at
first but the more I used it the more I
just felt like it was pretty silicone II
and didn't let my skin actually get
moisturized but this one I felt like
gave me the same like feelings and like
smoothing effects that I liked from the
original serum I tried but definitely
still let me feel moisturized so I
enjoyed this I don't think it makes you
super glowy or anything but it's nice
and I do have another one so I will use
that up it's not something I would
probably repurchase but I did enjoy
using it I have a pack of the South
Maine under eye gels these claimed to
reduce puffiness reduce dark circles and
to moisturize the under eye area I think
these are nice I think the price is
pretty nice too
I think you get three of them for ten
dollars on their website I got this
through a boxycharm and they're pretty
nice they're really saturated you put
under your eye you leave them on for 30
minutes so they're a longer mask they're
not one of those like really fast ones
what I liked about these is they stay
really cooling the entire time like the
whole time I have them under here I feel
I feel like a cold sensation so I
definitely think they do puff I
definitely think that they're soothing
to the under eye area now I'm not sure
if they reduce wrinkles I'm not really
sure if they super moisturized but I did
enjoy them and I would definitely like
use them again I just don't know if I
would purchase them because you have to
like go out of your way to go to their
website to buy them I have another quick
toothpaste in here this is the mint one
they only have one flavor of toothpaste
at least at the moment I really love
this
I got equip toothbrush sent to me from
actually and then I bought Sam one and
my mom got one and then she bought my
brother one and then she got her friend
about one where a whole quick family now
and I have repurchased this toothpaste
multiple multiple times I really really
like it it tastes nice and
yeah it's good I like it too more
products we have product that's in here
all the time this is the puffed me of
volumizing cloud mess this is a
volumizer that you spray into the hair
it's basically one of those powder ones
and yeah it gives you a lot of texture
you can't really run your hands through
your hair it's gonna let you have volume
that's still movable but not like so
movable that you're just like running
your hands through hair hopefully that
makes sense I really enjoy this Sam uses
this all the time I've gone through at
least ten of these now and last is a
little hand cream this one is from
Crabtree and Evelyn
it's the Nantucket briar scent I love
the formula of this hand cream but I
hated the scent of this one it was a
very clean spicy scent almost I don't
know I just did not enjoy it at all but
I did finish it up it wasn't something
that I just hated so much like I
couldn't stand it but it was just when I
went to bed it just it wasn't my
favorite but I love the formula these
are very moisturizing hand creams
without feeling greasy I like using
these at nighttime though because I can
really put quite a bit on and let it sit
overnight and it really does help repair
my hands and more than anything my
cuticles which gets so dry and I'm a
picker anyway I really do suggest these
though if you see them alright guys so
those are all my empties I hope you
enjoyed seeing all my Beauty trash thank
you guys so so much for watching and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
