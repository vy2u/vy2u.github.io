Lauren thank you so much for watching I
promise this is the last video I'm
filming in the sophistic but anyway this
is going to be my empties for the month
of October these are all the things I
used up in October that doesn't mean I
started them in October it just means
that they were all the way finished in
that month so let's just get into it I
sadly don't have any makeup items but if
you want to see some makeup empties go
to my finished 13 by Halloween project
pan finale lots of makeup empties in
there and you can get your fix so let's
just get in to the items I used up right
off the top here I have a couple of
loofahs that me and Sam are throwing out
we just bought new ones from Bath and
Body Works those are my favorite loofas
in case you are wondering it's just time
to let these ones go so we're gonna
throw in the trash and we're gonna use
the other ones I think I usually use
them about six months and then I get a
new one I think that's pretty reasonable
for them to like be used but also not be
bad I think I'm just gonna talk about
while the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works stuff at the
beginning here because why not
as always I have some hand soaps I love
the bathroom Body Works hand soaps this
first one is in tropical mint it was in
like the foam I liked it I thought it
was okay this was in our kitchen and it
took a little bit to use up but it was
fine I probably wouldn't like repurchase
that scent again I didn't have like a
connection but it was okay this one is a
golden autumn day and this one was nice
but I kind of didn't like it I don't
know there's a part of me that like I
would smell my hands like without my
hands by my face maybe like what's that
smell and I'm like oh it's the hand soap
so but it wasn't like a good thing
necessarily so I don't think I would
repurchase this one you guys know the
pumpkin marshmallow latte is like my
favorite I just purchased two more so I
have one I'm using there I want to have
now three backups including the two I
just purchased it's just my favorite I
didn't want to be without it and the
only other thing I have from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works in here is the wild citrus
sunflower shower gel this is my last
shower gel in the old packaging like
this I am so excited about that this one
smelt really nice
it was good I loved the bath and
Bodyworks shower gel so I'm glad I got
this one done I have quite a few things
for my kit in here that I have used up
the first one is 91% alcohol I use this
in my kit as sanitation for my powders
but you also need alcohol to activate
your alcohol activated pallets so that's
why I use a 91% you have to have at
least 91% so that you can use those
pallets and that's why I have this so I
use a lot of alcohol because I you know
like to be sanitary and not disgusting
this also helps me not be disgusting on
set this is the hand sanitizer from
assured I get this at the dollar store
this is my favorite one some of them
would just feel kind of gross on the
hands like they have like a moisturizing
aloe and stuff like I don't need that I
don't want to feel like I have a film on
my hands so I always make sure I
purchased this one I ever purchased that
multiple multiple times and then the
other thing that I use in my kit is the
cinema secrets makeup brush cleaner this
is the massive bottle and I really do
like this I was using the one from
Berman industries which I get at Namie's
and then I switched it back to this I
did repurchase this one I don't know I
go back and forth it just depends on
what store I'm at and what I'm feeling
so this is a really nice brush cleaner
though I have a couple of like staples
so I do have two of my fel wipes these
are the aloe vera which are my favorite
I get these at Big Lots for a dollar
each they're amazing I love them I'm not
gonna continue to go on I did use up one
of my cotton rounds I talked about in my
last video about like you know wanting
to maybe do something that was a little
bit more sustainable so I am gonna be
looking into the reusable cotton rounds
and see if those maybe fit my lifestyle
a little bit better we will see I
haven't done that yet but it's on my
list just so you guys know thank you for
all your suggestions I do have a tiny
foil sample this is the Lancome
Visionnaire you it's like an eye cream
it was okay it wasn't anything special
wouldn't purchase it I also finished up
this moisturizer from origins this is
the ginseng energy boosting gel
moisturizer I actually really liked
I kind of miss it it felt really nice on
the skin it was lightweight but I felt
moisturizing it's perfect for the day if
I had the money like if $60 which i
think is what this retails for just like
was like 20 like if that's what Maya you
know income was like then I probably
would just purchase this because it's
nice and I liked it but since $60 is
actually $60 to me I would not purchase
this at the moment I have in my cellar
water in here from simple I'd really
like micellar waters because they're
very gentle and they don't leave a
residue I use them to take off my eye
makeup so this one's nice I also like
the Garnier one I also like Bioderma
like I feel like the most the ones I've
tried I've liked I just have a couple of
things left this is a pure acetone huge
bottle I use pure acetone to take off my
nail polish I don't have any on right
now but I need to repurchase them and
get it it's just easy I also use acetone
in my makeup kit because I I like to
keep it for people to take off their
makeup but also if you're doing like
special effects stuff you need acetone
as an edger anyway I have a little hand
cream in here this one is from
L'Occitane and it is the dry skin hand
cream with 20% shea butter I love this
this is probably my absolute favorite
hand cream I've used although I did just
get the Crabtree and Evelyn like big
huge hand cream set and I've been using
lavender one and it's so good to like
I'm so happy I can't wait to use all the
other sins the lavender is smells so
good at night too like I'm like why
don't I use more things that smell like
lavender it's amazing like I don't know
if I'm just like turning into an old
woman but lavender smells amazing so
yeah I really like this though - I
suggest this one this is something I'm
so proud of this is a hand scrub from
Orly now you can use this for your body
as well but I mostly use this on my
hands and it's all the way used up this
is the scent passion which is neem and
Feola Feola I don't know how to say it
but this is not really nice it felt
really good I have one more of these to
use up and I've also declared one and
gave one
so they just take a long time to go here
because there's so much product which is
nice but it's kind of a lot for like a
hand scrub but I do think that my
moisturizer takes better on my hands
when I use a scrub so I don't know I've
been enjoying this kind of like extra
lavish step in my routine and everything
else that I have to show you our hair
items so first is this big ole batiste
this is the direction of coup in
tropical this is my absolute favorite
dry shampoo from like the drugstore at a
reasonable price I get them at Marshalls
know that's where I suggest you pick
them up you can get them at an amazing
deal but from a recent favorites video
you guys know I've been loving the
Moroccan oil one so I'm like so torn
because that one is amazing it smells so
good it works just as well as this if
not a little bit better but it is a bit
pricey so you will see these but anytime
I have the money or the opportunity I'm
probably gonna get the Moroccan oil one
speaking of Moroccan oil this one is the
dry texture spray I did not like this
this smelt nice but for texturizing it's
not my favorite it just mmm yeah it's
our favorite so I wouldn't repurchase
this and last this is just a dud you
hear this there's a lot of product in
here but this sprayer just sucked I
don't know why this happened to it but
it just won't spray out and it was
really disappointing because on set I
was like trying to use it and it's like
all messed up and I just look like an
idiot luckily I had an extra hair spray
like in a travel size so it worked out
but like I cannot have products that
just family on set so um I probably
won't purchase this again I did think
this was a nice hair spray if you want
like a strong hold but uh yeah that was
disappointing for sure I didn't even get
to use half of it before it totally like
clogged up and just is unusable alright
and those are all my empties guys I hope
you enjoyed seeing my trash this month
and yeah that's everything I'll see you
in my next video guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
