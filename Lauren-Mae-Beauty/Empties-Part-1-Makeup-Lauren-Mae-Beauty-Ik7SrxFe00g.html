video ever I'm gonna be showing you guys
my empties we're not gonna get into the
fact that I have empties and I've never
filmed a video it's quite a bit of stuff
I've been saving it for almost half a
year which is so embarrassing to say
let's just get into it I am gonna break
it into three different parts I'm gonna
film makeup skincare and body care and
then I'm gonna do hair care and random
in a separate video definitely keep
watching um so you guys can see all my
trash awesome we're gonna go into face
products first I'm just gonna kind of go
right in de Mele it's not gonna go like
how I do my face but just probably step
on the face first these are the
Maybelline fit me concealer I have the
shade light and fair I love these
concealers I think they're great
personally I like the fair one better
for my skin especially during the winter
I would definitely repurchase these I
have repurchase these and but I would
just get the fair color instead of the
light I just think I can get away with
that I have another Maybelline concealer
this is the dream Lumi concealer in the
color radiant this is a great concealer
as well I only use this one underneath
my eyes I don't use it to spot conceal
or anything because it is kind of like a
pinkier tone I think it's great to
either purchase this this is a second
one and I have another one coming from
all cosmetics wholesale I definitely
recommend this one if you're kind of
worried about your under eyes I think
this one's a great one from the
drugstore next I have a Rimmel match
perfection this one I liked I like the
consistency I like the actual product
it's just the packaging that I do not
like this one's in the color fair light
and it is a concealer and highlighter
when you use this though once you've
used some of the product the air and it
kind of gets into it and you have to
push it out and then you get like an air
bubble that kind of like pops product
off I've noticed like that happened to
me quite a few times can't do that like
while you're inspire I potentially pop
it into your eye so I just don't like it
for that but you just have to do that
before you get up there have a product
already on the brush before that other
than that it's a good product I just the
packaging is annoying I would repurchase
it if like say they were out of my other
concealers or I don't know I just wanted
to switch it up and not really said you
know it's a good product though just
packaging wise I just don't like that I
have a look at sealer here it is the
Urban Decay I don't even know what the
actual concealers it's a stick concealer
this one's in the
CIA I got this off the urban decay
website they were having a sale this is
only $5 I was like who went all crazy
and bought it I enjoyed this product
when I first started using it now not so
much I think it just is too drying for
me I used it under the eyes and also
around the face I also just think it's
too expensive for what it is personally
my mom did purchase this concealer and
she really likes it so I think it would
work for people just personally for me I
do like more of a liquid concealer this
I wouldn't repurchase for the price but
I think it's a good product that's all
my concealer is one of these hunters I
have here is Paula Dwarfs vanilla
pressed powder this product was good I
really liked it again I got it off all
cosmetics wholesale is very friendly
milled it was super light which I kind
of liked for setting under my eyes or
whatever but overall good product I
would repurchase it at the price I paid
for it on their site but I would not pay
full price for this I think it's I'm
just cheap when it comes to face
products I wouldn't repurchase it for
the full price but if they had it on
there I would get it again this is an
all-time favorite the Rimmel stay matte
powder this isn't transparent 0:01 the
packaging on this is kind of busted I
don't know if you can see that I love
this powder and I think it's great it's
so cheap it just works it's just a great
staple so I definitely wouldn't purchase
that and have your purchases this is the
number 7 beautifully matte foundation in
the color cool vanilla this is the
lightest shape that they offer I do find
that the shades sometimes especially in
winter is a little too dark for me so I
do like to mix it with another
foundation which I'll show you in a
second I really like this it's full
coverage it has a matte finish it's just
a good staple for me I either go totally
matte in full coverage or I do like just
a BB cream I'm kind of one or the other
so for me this works perfectly for that
I like the pump too it pumps it up from
the bottom kind of like the benefit one
actually just like the benefit one I
just think it's great it's drugstore I
think this is $13.99 I try to catch it
when it's like 25% off or buy one get
one half off just so I don't pay as much
I definitely have and will repurchase
this is the Bourjois healthy mix serum
foundation I've heard a lot about this
on YouTube everyone loves this on
YouTube I liked it too I'm not crazy
about it in the sense I wouldn't like go
and try to find it
got to get in the u.s. I enjoyed it
while I used it and if I had the chance
to get it at a reasonable price and a
reasonable amount of time and all that I
would repurchase it to me it's just it's
a good one you know it's a good
drugstore foundation there won't be
become this is like my favorite BB cream
ever this is in the color light I think
it only comes in three shades which
sucks hurt you know people that are
outside that shade range I wish that
they would extend that part of it but I
just think this is such a great BB cream
before the price I think it's for 5.99
it has just so much coverage I don't
feel naked or gross when I wear this
that I love this one
so so good these these are primer so
let's go into this one this is as the
like sample size of the Becca ever matte
poreless priming Perfector whoo this is
a primer that is not very silicone e so
instead it kind of like feels like it's
sucking your skin that sounds like a bad
thing it's not it feels fine like when
it is but it definitely makes it feel
like tighter and like there's less
moisture on your skin
this one's specifically once I've worn
it for a little bit it still feels dry
but it also feels gloopy the only thing
I can compare it to is if you put like a
stick of Elmer's glue on your face kind
of like the benefit one yeah that's what
it feels like it feels like that after a
while and I just don't like that I did
buy this in the full-size because I
liked it for the first bit when I was
using it so I like jumped the gun and
bought the big size one save understand
I'm not gonna repurchase this I'd rather
try other products out there I think
this would work for a lot of people just
personally I don't like that feeling on
my skin and with what I have been
wearing lately I just doesn't make I
would pass on this one personally this
one is another primer that works the
same ways that ones do not silicone but
it kind of tightens the skin it sucks
the moisture out this one is the Yves
pearl anti-shine mattifying gel primer I
really like this product I would
repurchase it again I got it off of
hautelook so it was $20 on HauteLook I
think that's kind of expensive but I
would repurchase it if it was on that
discounted price again but I wouldn't
pay full price for it and I just don't
so cheaper so videos like I'm so - last
face like actual face like was on her
biggest product is
gonna be this Josie Maran cream bronzer
the packaging on this will one it has a
bunch of fingerprints you can see that
this is in a Roseville packaging so it's
super pretty this is just a cream
bronzer I really like this product in
theory I guess there's a swatch of it if
you guys can see and it is weird to put
a swatch up there I really did want to
like this product it's not the products
but I just have never ever used it I
didn't buy this whole price they bought
her off with some type of cheaper
website and I just haven't used it and I
just feel like it's gonna go bad or is
bad since it's cream I just don't want
it staring at me making me feel guilty
so I am gonna get rid of that product
it's sad but I awful good once it's gone
that's all my face products so let's go
into eyeball eyebrow and eyeball
products let's do a cream shadow this is
the benefit Brisas cream eye shadow this
isn't the old packaging but this isn't
the color somebody loves me it is all
used up super excited about that this is
my favorite formula of cream eyeshadow
it's so great and even when it starts to
dry it does like it pulls away from the
thing but it's still so creamy I really
like that about it these are my favorite
formula I would definitely repurchase
these colors I'm trying to work through
a couple more but he's just a my
favorite so I feel like why am I the
Maybelline Color tattoos in 80 colors
when I get by like three of these this
is the Tarte lights camera lashes I got
this sample I ordered something from the
Tarte website it came dried up which i
think is just the lamest thing ever how
are you supposed to sample that so that
was a little stupid I do like this
mascara it's one of my favorite high-end
ones I would actually spend the money on
this one but I didn't get to use this
sample so stupid I wish I could now
these Oscars are one day actually used
so I can kind of give a little bit more
on them this is the Maybelline illegal
length fiber extensions mascara I didn't
really enjoy this one the wand on this
is just it's okay it is long and thin
I just kept poking my eye with it I
don't know it just wasn't that great I
wouldn't repurchase it I just go for
something else this is the L'Oreal
voluminous miss manga
I did enjoy this one it does make them
definitely clumpy it's what I want for
really dramatic lashes in my collection
this isn't like an everyday mascara for
me personally it just gets too clumpy
too fast
I would rather again have less volume
and more of length but I do I do like it
it's just not an everyday mascara for me
this is the covergirl Nature Lux mascara
this one I also didn't really like I do
I guess I like the brush on it it's a
rubber bristle brush but it was just
okay it's discontinued now I'm pretty
sure I did sit on all cosmetics
wholesale but I wouldn't like go and try
to find it like I loved it that much
this is the last blast volume extreme in
the waterproof version from covergirl
this one is one of my favorite mascaras
it's just a good one to have in my
collection I was using this we went to
Cancun one summer so I had this in my
collection from that it was just dried
up I only use this for like one I need
waterproof mascara it tends to go bad
before I use it up I really enjoyed this
would repurchase have repurchase yeah
it's a good month this is the Maybelline
one by one I thought this because of
another youtuber here a wand on this is
rubber bristle and it's kind of like
tapered here and then bigger and then
tapered again like a football it was
okay the wand on this is quite bendy
well it's not super bendy I guess I
don't know it was okay I would just try
a different one the rocket volume
expressed by Maybelline is the last
mascara thank goodness this one looks
very similar to the covergirl one to me
I didn't like this this made my lashes
really crispy and I don't like that
feeling you know like when you touch
them throughout the day and they just
feel like they're gonna crack off that's
how this felt for me I know a lot of
people really love this mascara I wanted
to really love this mascara but it's
just not one of my favorite one I would
not repurchase this again but I know
that a lot of people really enjoy it
last for makeup yeah it's just two lip
balms I have the Baby Lips here this one
it's just so cute it's not that great of
a lip balm honestly I used it up I'm not
saying I would repurchase it again
because lord knows the packaging I might
see it and just go crazy and get it
again but I definitely wouldn't use this
like if my lips were super trapped I
wouldn't be like I need my baby lips I
would reach for something else entirely
it's an okay product it's okay this is
the
lip-balm I co Bigelow got this about the
body works and I thought it would smell
it smells so good it smells like when
you go to the fair and they make you the
lemonade from scratch right there that's
what this smells like that tastes but
this the reason I didn't like this
wasn't because of necessarily the way it
felt it is more like a greasy chopstick
instead of like a waxy one it just it
tasted too sweet on my lips I put it on
and then when I accidentally lick my
lips or something it just was so sweet
like fake sugar was all over my lips and
it just was irritating to me I wouldn't
repurchase them on that I think it just
felt like cheap and young because of
that I wouldn't purchase it not my
favorites if you made it through this
video you're amazing guys a lot of
makeup I definitely want to get in habit
of just making these more often but I
will have parts two and three after this
so this would be the first one I'm just
gonna keep filming I'm someone to be in
the same outfit thanks for watching and
definitely hit subscribe I'll see you on
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
