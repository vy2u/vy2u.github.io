gonna be my second video part 2 of my
empties so this is all gonna be haircare
and random stuff yeah that's what it
looks like just keep watching if you
want to see which products I've used
first thing I'm gonna talk about is the
not your mother's hair beach babe
texturizing shampoo this does not have
any sulfates in it I bought this because
of the smell because it's like coconut I
just thought it's not so good
the smell kind of grew on me in a bad
way as I used this it just started
smelling kind of gross to me and I don't
like that it didn't have sulfates in it
I know that's bad but it didn't latch up
so I just felt like I had to use so much
product I just didn't like like the
smell plus that just made me not like it
I wouldn't repurchase it again if you're
looking for a sulfate free shampoo maybe
try it um I think that's just not my
thing so hmm
I'd rather damage my hair this is the
Garnier Fructis sleek and shine frizzy
dry unmanageable hair shampoo this was
okay to me
it's just nothing special it's just it
was just good like I would repurchase it
whatever not a big deal this is the
Garnier Fructis pure clean fortifying
shampoo this one is supposed to clean
your hair and kind of get build-up out
of your hair I definitely think that it
did that I personally have really thin
fine hair so product gets built up
really fast in it and it gets greasy
quite easily so I did enjoy this product
I need a product that's going to get
everything out and then also not leave
anything in it once it washes it so I
would repurchase this again I think it's
a good one this is a conditioner for
that same shampoo I enjoy this a lot
because it is a lighter conditioner
again with my thin hair I cannot have
super heavy conditioners I wish but it
just makes my hair greasy faster like
later on so I do like to go the lighter
conditioner I really like this one I
thought they worked well together and I
think this would be work well with other
shampoos and I would use this is the
clear scalp therapy total care
nourishing shampoo
did not like this I got this in a pop
sugar box I just it's too moisturizing I
felt like my hair was still like dirty
or greasy after using this just
personally for me it wouldn't work I'm
sure with someone with thicker hair it
would be great but it just wasn't the
product for me so it was definitely hard
using this one up but no repurchasing no
no no there's gonna be about a billion
Batista's in here I have so many I love
the cheese this is the best dry shampoo
out there it just makes my hair feel
good look good
I've tried like most the scents I don't
get the colored lines because my hair is
so light it doesn't really matter for me
honestly this is to see two three four
five six seven seven here there's so far
I don't even find another one in there
this again has been over quite a few but
I do go through them quite fast I don't
know if anyone else's like that some
people will be like oh three months my
one I'm like three months there's four
of them
but I love them I would repurchase them
I think they're great you can get them
at Marshall's for cheaper for like $5.99
I usually do that or sometimes Ulta will
do buy one get one 50% off I'll try to
catch that deal too but I would pay full
price for them just because they're the
best this one is the coastal surfing Sun
so this is my favorite favorite scent I
love it I bought like four just smells
so good I usually get compliments I get
compliments on my hand so I would quite
often and this one was the one that got
the most on so this one it's supposed to
smell like sandy coconut sparkling
pineapple creamy vanilla it's just great
I love it I hope they bring it back out
this summer but if not I got a couple
more to last me coconut and lime one
this one's just a great staple sin I
would definitely repurchase but it's
nothing super special look another one
of the coastal surf and Sun it's just
great Malibu sunset nothing special
about this one I think it's like it's
sweet lemon peony petals blooming
jasmine yeah it's melt very floral E but
still sunny and exotic I didn't really
like it and I wouldn't repurchase this
one again I promise it's the last one
this one's the apple mango
I love the
one apple mango how can you go wrong I
love Apple cents they're my favorite see
how it's just wasted product at the
bottom I hate that I have to body
splashes to talk about this is the honey
sweetheart body mist I used all this up
this was my favorite scent when I first
got it I loved it I bought all the stuff
I've grown out of it so I you know I'm
glad I didn't purchase a ton of backups
this scent was really nice really sweet
scent I just loved this one this one is
the French lavender honey scent from
Bath and Body Works this is a part of
their permanent line now I'm pretty sure
I really enjoyed the scent I have pretty
sure another like small one of it I've
just started to decide to buy travel
size body sprays because I don't go
through the full size fast enough and I
get tired of cents and you know if you
can't finish it up in a certain amount
of time it potentially could go bad so
I've you know made sure that I only buy
travel sizes from now on so that way I
have not like wasting product but I'm
still getting my money's worth and using
the product I really like this one I
would repurchase I haven't purchased
it's a good one I have some toothpaste
in here not like that big of a deal this
is the crest optic white one this one is
in a sea front and this one is in cool
mild mint this is my favorite one it's
not a very sweet toothpaste and said it
does taste not like a chemical because
that sounds bad but kind of just more
like bleachy it's still sounding bad um
but I do like this one this is the one
we use all the time every purchase I
just I like this one I don't necessarily
see tons of results with whitening my
teeth but if it's helping a little I
think that's worth it I'm just I'm gonna
talk about only two more things the
other stuff in here is kind of stupid I
have a mini Beauty Blender sample size
cleanser I guess it's gonna kind of gone
with makeup but this was okay I like the
solid one better cuz it's just easier
for me and I felt like I used this up
like in one time I use this on my
brushes not like just my Beauty Blender
it was okay
but I mean I don't see what this does
any more than one the solid one if I had
to go with it or like any other cleanser
so I don't think think you need to pay
the price for this one this is the Dove
go fresh cool essentials this is
probably my favorite one it's the one
ivory purchased the most that's for sure
I just felt like a Costco 6-pack of them
because I need to do dirt at that bag I
would reuse this again it's good the
sense okay I don't know it's not like
amazing it's just tried-and-true I guess
more than anything I'm gonna stop that
there this is a guy at haircare and
random stuff and then I still have skin
care and body care coming up next so
stay tuned for that video and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
