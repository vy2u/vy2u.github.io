video this is all going to be skin care
and body care type of stuff it's the
last video I'm so excited to be done
with all these products but I'm glad
that I could hopefully give you guys
some tips over like guys know what I
liked or disliked of them let's just get
straight into it and go for gold here
I'm gonna start off with facial wipes
these ones or the Burt's Bees I bought
these because they're a $5.99 I thought
that was a good price but I keep seeing
them at that price since they must
always be that cheap it came with 30
wipes in it I thought that moisture on
these was great the scent was a little
annoying at first but I did get used to
it so I used two of them I really did
like this one it was fine to use on my
eyes I'm pretty sure I can't remember
that I did really enjoy these there's
something I would definitely consider
repurchasing I just with face wipes I
try to get like not super cheap but
cheap money wise but not quality wise so
these are something I feel like it's
good in between I like the therap and
natural or natural one definitely like
these in would repurchase these two are
Neutrogena this one first here is just
the makeup remover one a lot of people
claim these are their favorite it's not
like an oily residue on my face and I
didn't like that I don't wash my face
with like something else after these
wipes so I don't like that it's oily
afterward because it feels gross I
wouldn't repurchase these ones everyone
loves them though I may wear my favorite
i wouldn't purchase this one is more of
an acne one this is the pink grapefruit
acne prone skin wine this one was good
the scent of these is grapefruit plus
like medicine you can't use them on your
eyes which is upsetting so they're okay
I got a Costco pack of two of these and
like this scrub for your face and I
really just needed a face scrub so it
kind of just all worked out but I
probably again would go with something
else not saying I wondered purchase but
definitely not in the near future that's
all the face wipes well just keep with
face stuff so these are gonna be faced
Grubbs I have this one here this is the
fresh sugar face polish it was just a
small size I got it for my bridal shower
from Sam's sister and I said I really
like this product the smell of it was
like lemon and brown sugar you put it on
your skin and you exfoliate it in I use
it in the shower but you can use
and then it's real sugar so as it
dissolves it kind of turns into this
like a milky consistency and I just let
that sit on my face I was in the shower
just to kind of moisturize it I really
did enjoy this I wouldn't pay the price
tag for the big one but it was a great
product while I used it this is like a
small little sample of the steal of
skincare glowing reviews gentle skin
renewal scrub this I got I ordered
something office deals website and they
were trying to promote their skincare
brand so that kind of gave me one of
everything in sample sizes of their
skincare I would really like this scrub
actually it's if you've ever used the
soap and glory face scrub it's like that
it kind of feels like fiberglass it
sounds so bad just kind of smaller
particles that aren't necessarily like
round little beads or anything that
scrub your skin it's a very intense
scrub without being thick scrubbers it's
weird
I think it works really well to just
kind of get all the dead skin off my
face I would definitely repurchase this
if it wasn't so hard to get I think
that's kind of thing about drawing me
back and the price but really just the
the ease of availability this is the
first day Beauty facial radiance polish
it's not like bell peppers to me so I
thought that was kind of weird but I did
enjoy this scrub as well so that's great
that these are all on yes is the beads
in here weren't as thick as the other
two that's the only thing I do like a
very if I'm gonna foliate let's
exfoliate you know none of that messing
around with a bead that I'm trying to
play around my whole face I would
potentially repurchase this I think
there's other ones under purchase first
though it wasn't bad but my not
repurchase let's do facial moisturizer
this one is not necessarily a
moisturizer but a serum I love this and
I'm not a serum person I got this in a
500-point Sephora perk kit I really like
this serum this is the plant scription
anti-aging serum when I put this on it
just sunk into the skin so fast and it
just felt so supple without being sticky
and I feel like the couple serums I have
tried have been sticky on my face and I
haven't enjoyed that but this one I just
really liked it if I wanted to go kind
of like I'm a moisturizer I could just
use this I just felt so luxurious my
skin feels so great I really want to
purchase this in the full-sized
this also came in that same like point
perk thing this is the origins perfect
world SPF 25 moisturizer I did not like
this the smell of it was just not my
favorite it's kind of lemony but
different I felt like - it's separated
and I don't know if that's because it
went bad or because it's more
all-natural and it just will go that way
but I didn't like that it made me feel
like hey I just opened this but it's bad
it just wasn't my favorite I used it at
night even though it has SPF so you
would think this would be a daytime one
it was just way too greasy so maybe for
more mature skin if you or dry skin it
would be great but for me it just was
way too heavy to use in the day so it
was only at night and I just I wouldn't
repurchase this one is also a no-go for
me this was the Korres yoghurt mask I
got that in a set from Marshall it took
me a long time to go through the other
stuff and I just don't think this is
good anymore so I just I kind of just
didn't want to even do it it feels like
it's gonna be a heavy one it is a yogurt
mask I also wasn't quite sure how to use
it I don't know I think it's just a mask
but I just I don't know I thought it was
moisturizer it is it a mask is a
moisturizer
I wouldn't repurchase this so okay I
mean I didn't even use it up and this is
just a small like travel-size ultra
skincare facial moisturizer this one
burnt our faces Sam said so - I don't
know is there like a lot of alcohol in
here something about this in there would
burn our faces like after a moisture
after we exfoliated and got out of the
shower and put this on and kind of burn
I didn't really mind the burning but I
just I wouldn't purchase it I think I
just better skincare out there for
cheaper or I'd rather pay more for
better this is the Cebu sea buckthorn
purifying mask I bought this at
Marshall's
it's just expired on me it was an ok
face mask it's nothing that I'd write
home about the smell of it was kind of
weird to me but it was just okay I wish
I used it up and got my money's worth
out of it that's kind of disappointing
but I wasn't gonna risk it with skincare
it has like a legit expiration date on
it like this is the date so I didn't
want to kind of go past that this is the
glam glow the all oh so famous glam glow
mass
this one is the super mud clearing
treatment this one is great I really
like this there's a little bit left in
there can you see that but it's really
not too much this is a great mask
everyone says so I agree I'll use this
one I'm breaking out and Sam will even
use this I like to use it as a spot
treatment to like if I have having some
you know major breakouts I'll put this
on there sleep with it overnight and I
feel like it really helps in the morning
I think it's great it's very pricey so I
did find this in a kit so it came with
this and the small one for the price of
just this one I think it's great I think
if you're gonna buy like one mask that's
gonna fight acne then just buy this one
you know and invest all your money in
this one instead of buying a bunch of
them I definitely I think that it does
what it's supposed to do and it's it's
worth the hype so so that's a really
good one this is gonna be like face
cleansers toners facial waters type of
thing first things first at the Kali
Beauty water and this one's like the
limited edition or collaboration one
that has a different packaging on the
front I got this while we were in France
so I did get it on a super good deal
compared to what it's it's here super
gray I would repurchase this I just
don't want to spend the money but um if
I was really treating myself or I had
some extra cash I would purchase this
again it just it smells so good it's
kind of this minty herbal II smell it
just is refreshing it you feel luxurious
you feel like you're really treating
your skin and I really did like this
product when I had it this one is a
similar deal this is the Evian natural
mineral water facial spray it's just
water so I wouldn't repurchase this
again I bought this with another one I
was like a two pack mini for $14 I think
that's crazy I'd rather just like splash
above water on my face then get these
again I think they'd be great if you
were at the beach or something like that
and it really was just to refresh your
skin in the sense that you were just hot
but for trying to like put anything in
there toning its water it's not gonna
tone your face what every purchase was a
little disappointed but I mean I guess I
should have known this is a poor wearing
a stringent or toner this is from
Neutrogena
yeah Neutrogena I really like the
this is my second bottle of this this
one is definitely a harsh one though so
you know when everyone's like oh it
doesn't burn my skin this one will burn
your skin I don't mind that though I
feel like it's working I feel like it's
cleaning my skin getting the dirt out
and it's just like a really basic one
for me I would definitely go back to
this one I haven't used a toner in a
long time but I definitely think I
should go buy this is the guy this is a
hand cream from L'Occitane this is the
rose one I got this one off of
recommendation from the sales guy in
there he said this one wasn't as greasy
as the other ones I would repurchase
this it felt really nice on the skin I
love the scent it was rose kind of
grandma rubbish if you don't like rose
since you won't like this but yeah I
really like this Sunday reminds me of
like my last semester in college really
good nice quality enjoyed this a lot
last but not least I just have some body
scrubs
this one's from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this
is the oahu coconut sunset body scrub I
don't like this scent I like this Senate
first and I'm a coconut scent girl my
coworker
I think totally you'd like jinxed me on
this she said she didn't like it after
I'd already bought a couple things in
the line and then I was like wait do I
like it I didn't like the scent of this
I'm so glad it's gone it kind of smells
like that not your mother's one that's
how it kind of grew on me just like a
little nasty so I'm glad it's done I
like these this is a pink sand body
scrub they also do like a pink like a
sugar one I like the sand one better I
really think the exfoliation in this was
a lot there were lots of granules I like
that and I like the container you can
just squeeze it out instead of like
gooping it out this was good just not
the Sun this is the tree hut Shea sugar
scrub in coconut lime love this I've
used up one of these before and I have I
think the Brazilian that one in like
waiting ready to go really like this
scrub you screw it off and you you know
kind of goop it out I don't like that
about it because water can get in in it
I just don't like it but other than the
packaging I really like the way that
this scrub works I love the smell of it
and it's really affordable I get them at
Ulta
I think you can get them usually buy two
get one free buy one get one half off
they usually go on some type of sale so
that's what I'll wait for definitely
great and what
last but not least this is the Melaleuca
Sun Valley almond milk and oats
exfoliating sugar scrub this you use for
your hands I really like the smell of
this it's all gone obviously it was
really nice it felt really good on my
hands like any scrub would and I've used
up a couple from Melaleuca Sam's mom
like doesn't sells Melaleuca stuff so
she'll usually give me these like for
gifts or whatever I really like this I
would repurchase them myself
I just haven't I'm not like out for
usually a hand scrub but this is a good
one and I really like the scent of this
one specifically the only thing is the
packaging wise the packaging stops like
right about here so you don't get the
full thing and I think that's just
annoying that's it's like a pet peeve of
mine like don't pretend that you're more
more than you are that's all my empties
guys have somebody film this and I can
throw all this crap away I'll see you in
my next video I'm probably gonna do some
type of haul or review or something so
stay tuned for that and I'll see you in
the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
