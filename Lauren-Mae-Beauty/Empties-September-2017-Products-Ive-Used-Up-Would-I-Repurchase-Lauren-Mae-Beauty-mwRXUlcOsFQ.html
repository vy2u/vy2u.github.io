Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna go through my empties
these are all products that I used up in
the month of September that doesn't mean
I started them in September though so
that's why I can have so much stuff
throughout every single month to use up
because some of these things you know
take four months but finally in
September they're gone
I'll leave my empties playlist linked
down below if you want to check out
other things I've used up other than
that let's just get into it I'm not
going in any particular order today
there's just it's just chaos today first
off I have my st. Ives blown of control
apricot scrub I love this it's
inexpensive the granules in it which I
believe are walnut shells or peach
shells walnut shells I'm right they just
worked so well I love the way this feels
Sam likes the way that feels to me this
has the smell of almost like an apple
cinnamon I know it's not but that's what
it smells like to me and I really
enjoyed it so I definitely would
repurchase this this is probably the
fourth one we've gone through I love it
it's great I have a hand soap here this
is from Kroger and it's the toasted
marshmallow liquid hand soap I got this
last year and I didn't go through it
because I don't know why you know
marshmallow scents aren't usually my
favorite I like that one you guys know I
like from Bath and Body Works but I was
scared I wasn't gonna like this but I
actually really did like the smell of
this marshmallow and so maybe I do like
the smell of marshmallow I don't know
it's not really nice I don't know if I'd
repurchase it because they just like the
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works better so it's gonna
spend the money I might as well get like
two of those instead of one and one but
I did enjoy it and I'm glad that I used
to go these are my all-time favorite
wipes ever these are the FPL aloe vera
cleansing tissues you get them at Big
Lots and it's a dollar for thirty or two
dollars for 60 I love them so much if
you guys have not gotten them on my
recommendation yet like what are you
doing go get them they're so good
especially if you use wipes it can just
get so expensive and I've talked about
this a lot but I also use them in my kit
and it's so nice that if like someone
needs to get out of there and I don't
have time to like clean them up or if
it's a guy or we're doing some more
intense makeup I can just give them the
pack to take with them and you don't
have to be like well now I'm out 15
dollars it's like it's a dollar I love
it it makes me feel good like I'm taking
care of them even when I'm not there I'm
like going above and beyond they're just
so good
I love them so so much I have a shampoo
empty this is for a big sexy hair but
this one is vibrant sexy hair because
this is supposed to help keep your color
and it's called the sulfate free color
lock shampoo
I enjoyed this shampoo I would not
repurchase it I didn't enjoy it that
much it had a nice scent to it it has
like rose oil and almond oil and I
definitely can smell both of those in
here but it wasn't overpowering which
was nice I like the color of the
container as for how it works this was
like the weirdest set I also have the
conditioner I'm still using that up in
my shower at the moment this was very
very liquidy it felt great in my hair it
I could definitely tell there was oil in
it in the sense that my hair was not
tangled when I use this and usually most
shampoos tangle my hair but this one did
not which was great and then I'd go in
with the conditioner and the conditioner
would tangle my hair it's so weird
usually it's the opposite way around but
not for this guy I didn't feel like it
kept my color any longer than any other
shampoo that's sulfate free so you know
it was okay I liked it but it wasn't my
favorite
I like the Moroccan oil one better than
this I like the melon and gets one that
I'm using right now better than this so
I wouldn't spend the money on this mmm
it was good though okay next is an
acetone this is the beauty 360 which I
believe is Walgreens brand just pure
acetone I like using acetone because
it's just fast and easy I like the smell
of it this was just given to me by
someone else so it wasn't full when I
started it but I used it up and that's
what I prefer I have a body wash here
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the Capri
seaside citrus I really like the scent
of this I'm glad it's gone but it did
smell really good it did have this nice
citrus but there was something about it
that I don't know it was just so good I
really like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works scents
anyway this is my second to last one in
this old packaging I have one more left
and I'm using it currently and I cannot
wait to get to the current about the
body where's freaking packaging it's
been like a goal for ever I was telling
my mom
back in Arizona and I told her I was
thinking about doing a video comparing
what my old like what my collection used
to look like compared to what it looks
like now let me know if you guys want to
see that I think it would just be
interesting because I think you guys
think I have a really big collection
still and I do don't get me wrong but
when I think about what I used to have
it's crazy
so anyway next I have in my cellar water
this is from simple and this is what
I've been going through because I got so
many at Costco you guys know that I
think this is an OK micellar water I do
prefer the Garnier over it I feel like I
don't use it up as fast I don't know why
I use so much of this up I go through
like a big one of these at least a month
so you know I'm glad I got it at the
really good price that I did and that
makes it worth it but if I was going to
pick just you know at the shelves normal
pricing on this or the Garnier I'd go
with the Garnier I have a floss here we
like to floss our teeth the reach one I
get it at the dollar store I love it
another common empties I have these
whispers cotton rounds and I went
through two of them I don't know why I
think because I also use these in my kit
that's what I'm telling myself because
if I go through two of these a month I
just feel like that's so wasteful so I
really want to kind of monitor how many
I'm going through a month and to figure
out how I can lessen that just so that
way I'm not just using them to
abundantly and not creating as much
waste I don't know just something I've
been thinking about next is a puff me
volumizing cloud mist I talk about this
all the time Sam uses this I use it as
well but Sam is the one who like goes
through these things like crazy if you
guys saw the recent haul I did with all
my hair stuff you know I got six more of
these and I've already purchased at
least six of these so yes I have
repurchase and I will continue to
repurchase until we find something we
like better but at the moment that's
doing it for us I have a little facial
razor I thought I would put this in
because in case you guys don't know I do
shave my face I like to use this when
I'm doing like a dry shave I use this
and I do sometimes just shave my face
with like a regular razor in the shower
it makes my skin feel nice and smooth
and makeup goes on a lot easier so I
totally embrace it and if you were
thinking about it I suggested it's
awesome and I get these at Big Lots for
a dollar fifty for three of
I think so yeah you can get those at a
lot of places though I did use up
another bath and Bodyworks wallflower
this is the old one and the new one that
I have in is lemon mint leaf and this
one's won't good though I think it was
like cranberry something you go to my
last empties and I'm always like one
ahead because I never can like keep them
all together it's it's already hard
enough like hoarding your trash to show
it in a video I'm not gonna like worry
about what scent you know I was using
next I have some sponges these are the
face secrets medium ultra wedges I use
these in my kit I get them from Sally's
and I really like it I don't know if
that's the cheapest place but I feel
like it's the cheapest place I can get
them in bulk then wanted get at the
other stores here so I just go with it
it's just what I do I keep doing it so
it's just kind of my thing I have
another pack of the fel face wipes I
also have a pack of the spa works
micellar water wipes these were $4 at
Marshall's I don't know why I bought
these they must have been out of them at
Big Lots or something cuz I I would
never buy these first off it's before
times the price of my other wipes and
he's just like smelt nasty I didn't like
the way they smelled I don't think they
worked very well
not a fan I just don't don't waste your
money you think $4 is cheap then get
them for a dollar you do have 4 packs
ok moving on from my white rant this is
the Crest toothpaste in whitening scope
with whitening scope um yeah I got that
at Costco I buy a lot of things from
Costco if you cannot tell Oh next so
exciting this is the deborah lippmann
rich girl hand cream this isn't my
project use it up video for a couple of
months I'll leave that playlist link
down below if you haven't seen it but I
finally finished it up I'm super happy
about that it did expire I think in
August yeah it expired in August so I
was like a little bit behind on using it
but it had like only a couple uses it
was just more the discipline of actually
using it I'm so glad that it's gone
though I enjoyed it I thought it was ok
I wouldn't spend the money but I do
think it's nice it has a sunscreen in it
which is you know nice if you're driving
and all that so it was good and I'm glad
it's gone I have
two little samples I don't feel like I
have that many little samples but I saw
these and thought I'm gonna use them up
this is the V she lifts active supreme
progressive anti-wrinkle and firmness
correcting care I don't really know much
about these I was using it as a night
cream and I got it at CVS there was like
a person there and then gave me samples
so I was like sure I'll take them it was
okay I probably wouldn't repurchase it I
feel like this is pretty inexpensive
when you talk about skin care but maybe
a little bit more expensive at the
drugstore I don't know I need to look
into this brand a little bit more but
those are just okay I am so excited
because they use up a candle and this is
the pumpkin apple candle from Bath and
Body Works I've had this for a really
long time and I I always liked the smell
of it but I never loved the smell of it
and then I started burning it and oh my
gosh I really really like this scent I
was not expecting that to happen it just
smells like fall it smells so good it
really got me in the mood while the
season is changing I don't know it just
makes me feel immediately like nostalgic
and sentimental and just so excited and
cozy I really like this and I this is
something I was like dragging my feet
burning so glad I finally used this up
I'm so glad that I enjoyed it instead of
hating it and I would actually
repurchase this so that's kind of crazy
but it's true I really like this it
smelt so good I had the perfect amount
of pumpkin and apple and a little bit of
cinnamon but nothing too spicy it didn't
smell too bakery but it still had this
like sweet scent to it it was just so
good it was really good I swear when I
have low expectations of things it
always blows me out of the water I do
have to make up items to brow pencils
what a surprise one is the elf brow
pencil in taupe I love this you guys
know that it's two dollars it's amazing
this is more of a creamy formula than
something that's super waxy and hard so
just keep that in mind I had someone
write a comment that they bought this
and it broke and I'm like so sad because
this is never broken on me and so they
didn't really like it and I'm sorry then
like it at least it wasn't expensive but
I've never had this break on me let me
know what if you've had this break on
you down below I don't know if I'm just
you know more gentle or if I've just
been
every time but I have had brow pencils
that break and that is so frustrating
but that one I don't know I haven't had
that issue and I love it and then the
other brow pencil is the one from
colour-pop this is the one in dopes
taupe which is their like the oldest one
that they have I nearly just came out
with a new one I really liked this it
reminds me of the Maybelline one and
also the Clinique one the way it twists
up and everything I did just make a
color pop order for the pony
what is it My Little Pony palette I was
thinking about picking this up but I
didn't kind of wish I had it look I
regretted a little so I would repurchase
this I thought it was nice five dollars
is pretty inexpensive for a brow pencil
the thing I like about this using it
with the elf one is that I can really
get a nice precise brow tail and I also
can deepen up my brow tail because this
is a little bit darker than the taupe
but I don't always do that the I can
always do my brows just with the elf
brow pencil if I need to that's all I
have in my brows today but this is nice
I have a couple more things in there all
relating to scents which is kind of
exciting this is a little spray and it's
these sexy little things noir again this
was in my project use it up and I
finally finished it off this was also
something that someone just gave me so I
didn't have it from the beginning I am
glad that it's gone now it's not my
favorite scent it wasn't horrible I'm
not really a body spray type of person
the only one I really like is the sol de
janeiro one I love that scent but other
than that I'm just trying to work
through the couple I have left and last
I have too many perfume samples these
are usually something I just don't care
about I have so many of these sitting in
my drawer I kind of want to do a project
pan all around trying to use some of
these guys up but the sense that I use
this one is gel Malone's blackberry and
BAE one of my absolutely favorite
fragrances I used to own this I bought
it when me and Sam were in Paris smells
so good oh it's so good it's like unisex
it's not too sweet this is definitely
within my scent profile and something
I've really really loved I definitely
want to repurchase this so yeah this is
also something I really love this is
Marc Jacobs Daisy and this is the oh so
fresh scent I like the original Daisy
better than this one but this still
smells so good this is some
that me and Sam have a lot of memories
with because it used to be my signature
scent for the longest time he's gotten
it for me a couple years for Christmas
and I just love it I don't have it in my
collection anymore because I'm I've ran
out of it a couple years ago and just
haven't repurchase but I do love this
scent I do it's so good alright guys
those are all my empties I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so so much
for watching and I'll see you in my next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
