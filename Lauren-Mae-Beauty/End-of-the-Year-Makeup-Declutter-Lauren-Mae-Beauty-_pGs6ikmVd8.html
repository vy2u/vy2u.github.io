Lauren this is gonna be another
declutter I don't know if I don't
declutter really recently but I just
been in the mood to cluttering away not
only my makeup but just like other
things in my life I've really just been
wanting to just minimize stuff and just
have less just little crap everywhere so
I obviously went to my makeup and
decided to declutter some things from
there
I am going back for the holidays so I
wanted to do this in time to bring
things with me for Thanksgiving
so that I could pass these out to my
family and they could kind of like go
through it I always do that
I also feel like I'm at a good point - I
mean - cluttering is a stage you can go
back to my channel and look at my
original declutter videos and declutter
series and you could tell it was so hard
for me I barely got rid of anything and
I look back now and half of that stuff
is not even in my collection anymore
since I've been letting myself buy some
new things I feel like there are other
items in my collection that I'm willing
to let go of because I haven't been
wanting to use them and I haven't been
using them and now I have news rings and
I'm definitely gonna reach for those
over the older things with that if you
haven't seen my like chitchat video I've
been very reminiscent lately and just
thinking about things and I just came on
the one-year anniversary of me leaving
my beauty job so that means anything
that I got while I was working there as
gratis is now at least a year old if not
more than a year old and I think
thinking about that put it into
perspective for me that this stuff is
older I still haven't used it in a year
I didn't even pay for it to like pass it
or throw it away some of the stuff is
throw away but let's just get into the
declutter some of it is makeup some of
its just like beauty it's not that
organized so I apologize but let's just
dig into the bag I literally have this
big of a bags like of just stuff to pass
on so yeah something right off the top
this is a body lotion I did put this in
my 7 summer flings and I use some of it
because it was full but I just have
decided I don't want to finish it so I'm
gonna pass it on I might not show you
everything in this bag because some of
its kind of boring I'm gonna try to keep
it more exciting
this is the dermablend long-wear makeup
remover and I was keeping this to
potentially use my kit but I really
haven't been so I'm going to pass it
another lotion this is the hemp
pomegranate I really do like the hemp
lotions but I've had this for a while
and again i just i don't use lotion I
don't enjoy lotions and I really only
need one at a time so I'm slowly de
cluttering basically until I get there
but this one I've had for a while and I
don't want it to go bad so I'm gonna
pass it on so someone can use it this
one's really random so but this is a
hand sanitizer I got this from the
dollar store it's in a nice size I was
using it in my kit but this specific
brand I don't like I don't know it
doesn't hand rx I don't like it it just
it's too moisturizing on my hand so I
feel just like it dunks up my hands
instead of cleaning them so I'm gonna
pass this on I don't even know if
someone would want that but hopefully
we're getting into the bottom because
some of the stuff is like brush holders
and weird stuff but this is a whole bag
of samples I said in my new year's
resolutions beauty resolutions that I
didn't want to keep samples for more
than two weeks and somehow I've
accumulated a bunch of samples again so
I'm going to be passing these on for
people who want them there's also like a
couple like random tools in there like a
little brush and like these toe
separators I guess it's a little
organized right like in bags I also have
a ton of little perfume samples I'm
gonna pass on these are ones that I know
I don't like I went through and I smelt
them and I don't really like them I also
have a couple of roller balls in here so
I'll show you those one is the Michael
Kors very Hollywood I don't like to
smell of this I bought this on eBay a
long long time ago way before I had a
channel I just don't like the smell of
it so I'm gonna pass it and then the
other one is the Tokyo milk tainted love
and there's something about Tokyo milk
that makes me want to like it I want to
like all their scents but they're sensor
not me they're so musky and I'm just
that's just not my scent I know so many
people like them and I know a lot of
people will like this and I just can't
force myself to like it I don't this is
not my scent profile at all I like clean
and even like unisex and more manly but
I do not like things that are too musky
and like have that like amber scent and
patchouli
those types of sounds I don't like so
that's totally this I don't like it I
have a few body mist in here these are
both from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the
Paris in bloom I do like this end I just
don't think I'm gonna like it enough to
use up a whole bottle of it and again I
would just rather pass it I've had this
for a while and that's all I've used of
it it's just time to let it go and this
is the oh oh oh that is so hard to say
I've tried to say like 400 times the
body spray and I just don't like the
scent of this anymore I liked it when I
first bought it and I bought a bunch of
things in this scent but now I don't
know it's just like changed in my in my
mind it doesn't smell bad like it's gone
off it just has changed for me like I've
changed and I don't like the scent
anymore so it needs to go and something
to that helps me is it's just like I
know someone would have so much fun
using that or just like enjoy it so much
more than I do so just there's no reason
I have a couple nail polishes here these
are from the painted nail I just don't
need these I've really condensed down my
nail polish collection and I'm really
only keeping things that are super
special to me and I really like the
glittery colors or cream polishes and
different colors in these so I'm just
passing these and someone else can enjoy
them okay I have a few more bath things
this is just a bar of soap again I know
it's so weird like mine is like the
janky declutter and like all the bags
and stuff like what the heck anyway this
is a soap from the farmers market and I
got this when my mom was here last year
and I've never used it so I'm just gonna
give it to her so she can use it up I
need to not ever buy bar soap again
unless it's to clean my brushes I just
don't you said this is a lush product
and it's one of their bath bombs it's in
a star it's so cute but honestly I just
don't take baths in my house one my tub
is just not clean enough if I'm in like
we're being so honest this is like the
honest video no my bath does not clean
enough to take a bath in it and I don't
want to clean it really like that
hardcore so that I could then relax in a
bath plus if I sit in a bath like my
bath is just a normal tub where you took
a shower half my body fits in it so it's
just to me kind of pointless to them and
pass it on to someone who could
hopefully use it and enjoy it
lotions more lotions this is the
bathroom body works lush pink this came
out it's like limited edition whatever I
also have the Paris and more body cream
and I do like the body creams I just
don't like the pairs a more scent any
longer
I don't know again it's a little too
musky for me I like something a little
brighter a little cleaner and I do have
a sebum ed hand cream this is for the
hands and nails this isn't a bad hand
cream it's pretty lightweight I just
have other hand creams and I haven't
been using my hand creams and I'd rather
use them I really like the code early
ones and I really like the lots of
Tomlin's so I just don't want to have to
go through this another Genki bag um
these all have nail polishes in them and
like little mini perfumes I have like
one two three four mini perfumes five
mini perfumes and then a bunch of julep
nail polishes if you've been with my
channel for a while you know that those
julep polishes were in my project polish
that was a fail and a half it was such a
bad fail so I'm just passing them on
I've never used them I don't want to use
them so someone can use like the last
little bit to that if they want or I
might just throw a muy I'm not sure the
rest is makeup so you know stuck around
this long we got to the good stuff sorry
it took so long this is a BB cream type
of thing this is the miracle face
transformer from it I think the brand is
miracle skin transformer it's in the
shade medium so I'm gonna give that to
my mom I got this from my manager and I
opened it to see if I would use it I
don't think I will so I'm gonna pass
that along
you guys knew this was coming this is
the narcissist dual intensity eyeshadow
palette and I'm passing that on I think
my mom wants this I'm not sure you know
what she'll do she'll text me after I
post this video and she'll be like I
want this this and the essential Tommy a
list yeah that's her she watches every
one of my videos she's the best let's do
this this is a by terry foundation and
this is in the shade number four natural
beige my skin type isn't right for this
so I thought I would just pass it on
another by Terry item this is the CC
cream this has
like coverage so it's just not for me
again I think my mom might like it it's
in the shade number one these are really
nice products it's just I need to be
real with myself I don't want them
wasting away and I don't want to feel
like I have to use stuff I want to use
what I actually am enjoying using you
know what I mean another thing from the
miracle skin brand this is the miracle
eye transformer and it has a tint to it
I was using this for a little bit but I
just don't want to force myself to use
it anymore so I'm in a passive this is
one that was kind of hard for me this is
a blush palette from Trina Tarantino and
there's nothing wrong with this I just
don't use it and I have so many other
blush palettes that I need to pass this
on and I mean I could use it in my kit
but I just bought the new Tarte blush
palette and realistically I know I'm not
actually going to use this even though I
want to keep it so I think that someone
else could get good use out of that this
is a color correcting primer it's a
green one and it's from number 7 beauty
I just don't like this I don't find that
green correctors work that well I'd
rather do like a yellow one or I don't
know just something tinted I don't know
I just maybe it's just this one I just
don't like this oh this one's sad this
is the dream matte mousse from
Maybelline I just purchased this this
year at the beginning I made an order
for my PB and J pallet and bought this
with it this just doesn't smooth onto
the skin how I want it to I can't use a
brush I can't use a sponge I have to
basically use my fingers and it just
slips around there's so much silicone in
this that it's hard to get it to not
look streaky or to layer it like I just
I'm I can't do it so I'm gonna pass it
this is a color pop eyeshadow in the
color sour it's a lime green and I only
have a couple color pop shadows left I'm
just not gonna use this I don't really
like to wear green shadows and you can't
really use these in the brows I've tried
so I'm just gonna get rid of that I have
a hand sanitizer here this is from
Victoria's Secret and it's in the love
spell scent I've had this for forever
I've never used it and I have a bunch of
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works one so I figured I
might as well just pass this along I'd
rather use those hands up then use this
the rest of the stuff in the bag are
things that I'm declutter in but I might
not be giving away I might just throw
away because they're old or whatever so
I have three mascaras this
is the essence I love extreme this I
haven't used but once or twice I just
didn't like it and it's just not worth
my time I don't have time to sit around
and not like a mascara so I'm gonna get
rid of that this is one from Maybelline
the great lash and I just had this a
while so it needs to go and this is one
that's old - I never used it but I'm
realizing like this is a really old
mascara for not ever using it and it's
the Elizabeth Mott it's so big I know
kathleenlights really likes this I'm sad
that I didn't use it when I could of so
it just needs to be trashed
another little perfume sample I have
quite a few lip products I'm really
trying to streamline my lip products in
my personal collection and just keep the
things I actually like and will actually
use I want other colors I have a whole
makeup kit and I could run in there and
get it I'm mostly like nudes darker
nudes you know classic stuff so I'm
getting rid of these two Tarte pencils
these are already discontinued so you
know they're old ones in and chanted and
ones in glisten and this one's like
really old I think they don't smell bad
at all I just don't want to use these
these aren't my favorite formula they're
a little too moisturizing I know that
sounds like a really weird complaint to
have but I just I like matte stuff
better than like something really shiny
so I'm gonna get rid of those these are
something I'm kind of sad about the
fresh sugar lip balms are some of my
favorite lip balms the original one is
my absolute favorite lip balm but these
tinted ones are just too tinted and they
just get a little sloppy so I'm going to
be getting rid of these they also are
going bad I got these quite a few years
ago and since they have more natural
products the lemon scent is changing
into a kind of crayons and and it's just
time to throw them away
I will never purchase the small mini
sets of these ever again it's not worth
it and also the product in here comes
loose from the base because it's so soft
so soon when you get these that I just
think you should make a decision pick
one maybe two and enjoy those two
instead of having a bunch of little ones
and that's really weird for me to say
because I usually am like get the minis
it's better last two lip products this
is a product from Stila and it's in the
color Bay it's baie and it's a really
pretty color I do really like
I was trying to use it up so there's a
bit of a dent but I've just decided I
don't want to I'd rather use my nukes
one I really have been enjoying that lip
balm over this so this needs to go this
is another old and just thing I don't
like actually this is something I just
dislike this is the Vaseline lip therapy
and original i if you like this I'm
sorry that I hate it so much but I just
hate this I don't think it does anything
I think it just puts a weird layer over
your lips without actually penetrating
no thank you
these are some things from pure and I
got these at generation Beauty I worked
at the pure booth and so they gave me a
little bit of free product and it's so
funny because Kaylee from hello Kaylee
was talking about these because she got
it from oculi and how it's just like
what the Freak and it is it's like what
the Freak product so that's what it
looks like and it's just like messy the
color for me is off on the blonde shade
it's a little too yellow like yellow
blonde instead of I don't know like just
cool toned ashy I also find that even if
you can get past the color while you're
applying it just so much product falls
onto your lower like just falls on you
it's just kind of like innovative to be
innovative but it's not actually working
so I have one that's like not even
opened in a different color this is a
medium brown I'm gonna pass that on and
I'm passing on the blonde I mean I kind
of feel bad to pass these on because I
don't think they're gonna work for
someone but hey maybe they're magicians
and they'll make it work last item for
my declutter this is the dr. feelgood
from Benefit and I was trying to use
this up this year and I was trying to
use it and I just decided I don't want
to so I'm getting rid of I'm probably
just gonna throw this away though
because I have been trying to use it
this year I just feel like it's older
and I my grimy little hands have been in
it so it's time to pass it into the
trashcan
that's everything I'm going to declutter
I hope this inspired you to get rid of
some things I know I've been doing some
hauls lately and I feel like bringing
that new stuff in kind of gave me the
push to move some other stuff out I'm
really excited for next year and doing
some more project panning but I also
want to pan things I like I do
want to just pan things that suck so
this was kind of a way for me to clean
up some of those items that I might have
trapped myself into panning and just
like hated in my life and I'm really
happy to be able to pass these on to
other people who will hopefully make
them work that's everything from my
declutter I hope you guys enjoyed the
video and I will see you in the next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
