channel thank you so much for watching
today I have a lot of wrapping up to do
lots of ends of project pans and then
I'm starting a couple new project pans
so this is going to be my finale for my
end of the year project pan I had
decided for the last two months of 2015
to pick out 30 different products in my
collection that I either was really
close to using or just wanted to really
focus on and use up in those two months
should try to get them out before the
end of the year so I'm gonna show you
guys where I got I'm really happy with
this project I finished I believe about
20 products out of the 30 which i think
is a super big success I know that if I
hadn't done this project there's no way
I would have finished all 20 of those so
let's get into it I'm gonna try to go
fast we'll see when my first goals was
to hit pan in a shadow in my lorac mega
pro 2 that shadow was burlap as you can
see there I did hit pan I was really
happy to hit pan in this palette so fast
because I did just get this it's nice to
see it have somewhere I mean you can
already tell how that unaware from the
outside of it it looks already super
beat-up so really happy with that I love
that shade I used it in my crease it was
great I used up this Amazon colored clay
foundation this had a little mesh like
thing in there and I did cut it out I
got as much as I could out of here it's
kind of hard packaging to get every last
drop out I did enjoy this item but I
found that I did get greasy throughout
the day with it so it's not something I
would repurchase but I am glad that it's
out of my collection now and that I got
the use out of it this is my Smashbox
contour trio and I just wanted to use up
one shade which was the lightest shade
here the highlight shade it's completely
gone it's so grody and I'm so sorry that
it looks so nasty but I'm really happy
this
at the beginning when I was using this
shade I absolutely loved it and then I
felt like as I used it more and more it
was too dark for me it could have been
with the changing of seasons like as I
got colder and I was less tan it was too
dark I don't know I wasn't my favorite
at the end but I am glad I worked
through it
and I just have two shades left in here
so I want to work on those this year I
used up my Rimmel stay matte powder this
is my favorite powder from the drugstore
ivory purchased this a ton of time so
I'm glad to just finish this one up and
get it out I used up my lorac behind the
scenes eye primer this primer is great I
don't think it's anything that special
but it does keep my lids from creasing
throughout the day so it's an okay one I
got it for free with the lorac Pro
palette this is my starlets eyeshadow in
the color pearl I just wanted to hit pan
on it and I did I used this has a face
highlight and I absolutely loved it I
have since put it in my drawer and
started using other eyeshadows and
highlighters and stuff because my goal
this year is to hit pan on as many
eyeshadows as possible but I did really
enjoy this and I can't wait to finish it
up and bust it back out again later in
this year or next year I finished up the
Tarte gifted mascara I really did like
this mascara
it's a drier formula I think it gives
you nice length and volume it's good I'm
not sure if I would repurchase it
because I do like other mascaras as well
but it was nice to use another eyeshadow
that I wanted hit pan on was this one in
the wet and wild eight pan in this
shades or in the I don't know style
walking the red carpet this shade here
was the one I wanted to hit pan on it is
like a light cream light pink type of
shade I used it over my eye primer to
kind of set it and give myself a nice
base for blending shadows onto it it's
good again I'm moving on to try other
things and hit pan on other things but I
would want to finish this one up
sometime hopefully this year or next
year or something this is something I
didn't know if I would actually finish
this is the it's skin baby face eyebrow
pencil I love this pencil I put it in a
favorites video it is all gone now as
you can see I can't roll it up anymore
and I do want to repurchase this pencil
once I work on a few more pencils I have
in my collection it's only $5 and I
think it's just a great one so did love
this
I'm it's bittersweet that I guess it up
this is the Smashbox BB cream I do
really like this BB cream I think it's
great it's super expensive though so if
you're looking for a high-end BB cream I
definitely recommend this one it gives
you great coverage and I find that I I
don't get too oily with it although it's
like a BB cream formula usually I find
that those make me greasy like really
fast this one I feel like still controls
my oil for a good amount of time and has
a great coverage so definitely recommend
this if you're willing to spend the
money on it and I was just got to use up
a little sample of it something to note
about this one though is the shades do
run dark so if you're usually light made
me go with fair I don't know fill the
shades just test the shades out in the
store cuz they can get a little weird
this is the benefit Girl Meets pearl
just a deluxe size mini I use this as an
illuminator for my entire face so I
would put my primer on it then i put
some of this on and then i would go in
with my foundation i really liked the
look of it especially in the winter
months i know a lot of people like to go
matte in winter but sometimes your skin
can't handle looking that on top of it
being super dry so this was really nice
to kind of give myself some like life to
my skin but it's not too crazy and not
too oily or anything so really liked
this i would potentially buy this to
have my kit for just that type of
situation i was able to use up the two
steel liners these were in the color
berry antique i am working through these
throughout the last year in 2015 and
also this year they're okay liners
they're nothing amazing and i just have
so many of them I just want them gone
they're kind of my oldest item so it was
nice to move through two of them in this
project
this was my fresh sugar lip balm and
honey this is kind of a give me product
I barely had any left from my last
project and I kind of rolled it into
this one I did finish it up quite early
on so you guys already knew I use this
but again so nice to get another one of
these on my collection I really need to
focus on the little mini sugar lip balms
that I have left this is my Maybelline
fit me concealer and fair I love
concealer it's one of my favorite from
the drugstore I took the stopper out and
everything on this guy this one was kind
of one of the ones that was finished
early on as well this is the Clinique
bottom lash mascara I love this
I would definitely repurchase it it's
perfect for the bottom lashes because it
has just such a tiny little wand that
you can really get in there and separate
them out they don't get too clumpy plus
it doesn't smudge on the bottom lash
line which is something that's really
important I think to anyone that they
don't have recognized by the end of the
day because of their bottom lash mascara
so definitely would want to repurchase
this this was my honest Asya clear brow
gel
I used this up I use this for like the
whole year so it was just kind of time
to call it done I was barely getting any
product out anyway so this was kind of a
I need to replace it so I'll throw it in
here and make sure I use it every day
and then just replace it
this was the YSL primer this is the blur
primer I did enjoy this I don't think
that it kept me matte which is something
that I really look for in a primer but I
do think if you're looking for something
that's gonna smooth the skin and give it
a nice texture to put foundation on I
think you would really enjoy this maybe
if you have drier skin this would be
great for you I do have another sample
size that's this size that I just
recently got so I will be moving through
that one but I would never spend the
money on this
another liner I finished up and lots of
liners this is the anasazi of Beverly
Hills noir eyeliner it's just a black
twist up eyeliner I use this up pretty
early on so glad to be done with this
the cap was really hard to close on this
liner so I found that without even
knowing it I was letting it dry up and
it didn't stay in my tight line very
well so I'm just glad to be done with
this and move on I only have one more
item that I finished using now
technically as you can see there's still
product on there but this is a
double-ended
product one is supposed to be for
contouring the other one's supposed to
be for highlighting and I was just
focusing on the highlighting side
because the contouring side is too light
to be a contour but as you can see
that's all I have left the caps touch
together when
when I put them on so I definitely am
considering it done for the project
I will finish using up that last little
bit but honestly I don't know when it's
gonna turn to the contour side because
I'm definitely more than halfway done
and it's still coming out the light side
so I thought that was kind of weird I
will probably most likely be finishing
this up and then just tossing it because
I don't think I'll have use for the
darker side and since I already have
used so much of it I mean it's just a
little nub anyway so I'm just gonna keep
sharpening down the one side and then
toss it once it's done now onto the
products that I didn't finish they're
mostly lip products I'm not very
surprised with that I didn't finish one
lip product that I put in this project
it's disappointing but I'm also again
not surprised lip products are the
hardest item for me to pan I don't know
what it is about lip products that makes
it so hard but any one you can get
through a lipstick and even like half a
year like you're amazing to me so let's
just get into the product side and
finish up this was the benefit boy and
concealer I really stopped using this I
only used it at the beginning of the
project and then my skin has since
cleared up a lot and there was just
really no use for me to use this product
so I'm going to keep it in my collection
for times when I really need a
heavy-duty concealer to really combat
dark circles or breakouts or something
or really dark redness for whatever
reason I'll just keep it until then
hopefully I can get it up this year
because it is getting kind of old
and I just it's not my favorite I'd
rather have something else so before I
get that I'd have to use this up but
anyway I did my best on it but I wasn't
gonna force myself to use it it's kind
of thick it just wasn't working toward
the end of the project so I just called
it this was my mascara this was just a
tiny sample of the bareMinerals lash
domination I have used this a couple
times and I'm going to continue using it
until it's used up I did recently get
the velvet noir mascara from Marc Jacobs
in the mail from influencer so I kind of
put this away so that I could be testing
that product out and a review will be
coming for you guys on that soon I have
got a bunch of yeast out of this product
since then but I'm just going to finish
it up once I get the time to finish the
rest are all the lip products I didn't
finish
we all knew I kinda wasn't going to use
the dolce vita lipstick from NARS so it
looks exactly the same same with the lip
gloss from buxom in the color Leslie I
was using it a little bit at the
beginning and then kind of called it
quits so that I could focus on other lip
products because there are so many in
this project so no new progress on this
one this is one I actually did make
progress on this is the bare minerals
marvelous Moxie lip gloss in the color
rebel I think this is a great shade and
although it's not much I did make some
progress although I didn't finish this
item I'm super happy with the progress
this is the closest I have ever come to
finishing a lip gloss whether it's
full-size or mini or anything so really
happy that I even got this far on
something like a lip gloss probably my
biggest disappointment is the stupid lip
injection the Too Faced extreme lip
plumper thing why can't I just finish
this I don't know what my problem is
it's so close seriously there are only
so many uses out of this but technically
I mean there's still product in there so
again I'm just gonna keep working on it
I'm not putting this in another project
though because I just I can't bear to
tell you guys I haven't finished it
again last product this is the Kat Von D
lipstick and salafi tarde and I made
great progress on this too it is now a
rounded nub instead of being pointed I'm
really happy with that there is barely
any product in this I really shouldn't
be that happy about it but I am because
I mean it's almost gone and I will take
it I hope you guys enjoyed my finale
I love how through these projects we can
motivate each other into using up
different things in our collection I
think I did really well for two months I
used up that much stuff that is amazing
and I'm really glad I kind of used the
last two months of the year as a push to
get products out I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day look out for me
and this hair and makeup a ton more
times because I have a lot of these to
do I have a lot of videos to fill
so I will see you in my next video guys
