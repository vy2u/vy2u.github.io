channel I have just finished filming my
finish 13 by Halloween which I will
leave link down below it was my finale
video and this is going to be the next
project I am starting so I have my
project pan roulette still going which
I'm going to be finishing out by the end
of the year and then this is going to be
another project that's kind of I want to
be finished out by the end of the year
this is kind of like a mad dash to
finish as much makeup as I possibly can
I was looking back at my video where I
showed like what makeup empties I had
for the year like my halfway point and I
did put some different goals in there of
like specific amounts of makeup and
categories that I wanted to use up so I
took this time to kind of make sure that
those goals were going to be hit I had
made specific goals on hitting some
liners as in hitting liners I mean using
up a specific amount of liners for the
year as well as primers foundations and
something else I can't remember
obviously I like planned what the
products I picked so if you guys would
like to see that video I will link it
down below as well so lots of videos
linked in the down bar if you're
interested definitely check that out but
this project is going to be all make up
again because I do a lot of all makeup
project pans on my channel my goal for
the year is to finish up 75 makeup
products and if I finish up these 30 I
will for sure hit that and then I will
also with these items including some of
the items of my other project pans
I will definitely also hit all my like
subcategories of those 75 products let
me go over the products that I've picked
out it picked out 30 items that I'd
really like to finish by the time 2016
rolls around so I have until December
31st or January 1st I guess however that
works to finish up these items it's only
two months so I'm gonna try to update
you guys two times and then have my
finale so through more videos and yeah
I'm just gonna get into it because
that's a lot of products to show you
it's kind of a lot of stuff I feel
excited about it so it'll be good it'll
be super but I love using makeup I went
back through all my like makeup empties
and it's like crazy because if you were
to ask me oh did you use a lot of makeup
this year probably would have told you
no I haven't used that much up like it's
not that much but I mean I have a good
bag going of just I mean makeup empties
I have like over 50 I think right now in
my bag which is crazy like that's a lot
of empties 50 items and so I think next
year sorry I'm rambling but anyway next
year I'm going to I'm gonna be way more
accountable to like how many items I'm
bringing in to my collection as well as
how many items I'm moving out because I
really wonder how many items I bought
this year and then how many items I'm
clearing out and like what that
difference is anyway that's just
something I was thinking about some of
these things are rollover items from
other project pans because they're like
almost done or whatever other things
they're just in my collection they're
like on their last legs I want to get
them out some are brand new things that
I'm like trying to like hit pan on or
whatever so we'll see I want to finish
up these two liners these are my
finished 13 by Halloween and I didn't
finish them up but there's like barely
anything left so these should be no
problem and there'll be two more things
down this is an item I know I'm not
gonna try to use the whole palette up
because I'm not insane but I do want to
definitely at least hit pan on the
shadow but I really want to work hard to
like get the whole shadow done I know
that's kind of ambitious for only I
don't know what two months not even two
months now that I'm uploading this so
definitely want a hit pan which I
realize won't finish this item but it's
still like a goal I want to have for
this shadow and to make some decent
progress on it so I really have never
used this palette and so then I've just
been using this recently and I thought
might as well use something from it
finally since I bought it this is the
Rimmel stay matte powder and I got hit
pan on this and then it started cracking
so I need to repress this product but I
just want to finish it up and get it out
of my collection I have a lot of powders
a lot of them are loose powders but I
just want to like really condense down
that part of my collection
just because it's not something I'm
super into I I'm okay with having a lot
of like colorful products and eyeshadows
and blushes but like foundations and
stuff I don't necessarily need for my
own personal collection and don't need a
ton of them so I want to use that
product up and it will be pressed by the
time you see this next I'm going
press it tonight like I promised y'all
I'll press it tonight
this is a palette this is the Smashbox
contouring trio and I've already hit pan
on the shade so I thought why not finish
it up before the end of the year I
really like this for highlighting
different areas so I'll put it under my
eyes and center my forehead down my nose
on my chin I really like it for
highlighting obviously I've already hit
pan on it so I just thought I'd finish
it up and yeah why not there's so much
this is gonna be a long video this is
the lorac eyeshadow primer and all the
way down to like the where the bend is
but there's a line I made a big line
there I thought a sense now another
spoiler I finished up my nude stick in a
moon from my project panel edge so I can
start using a different eye primer so
I'm going to use this as my base now as
a primer so I'm so close to being done I
might as well just get this thing out of
my collection I have three mascara type
of items that I'd like to use up
currently I'm using this gifted mascara
from Tarte it's just a mini sample I
finally finished up my realest olan so I
had to move on to something different
and this was kind of dry even when I
first started it so I don't know how
long it will last but I'd like to finish
that up since that's dry I figure I can
at least move on to this like super baby
mini this is the bare minerals lash
domination volumizing mascara I really
wish I had used this earlier too because
we sell this at work a lot and people
ask me all the time about it
and I didn't realize had a sample and
could have tried it but anyway since it
is so tiny I figure I could definitely
get both those done in two months and
then this is my Clinique bottom lash
mascara I've had this for a while now
it's starting to get a little dry so I
just really want to focus on using this
everyday and then by the end of the year
I mean it's gonna be done but it's also
like if I really like this product but I
just need to buy a new one at that point
so I'm just making myself use it in this
project and I definitely think it'll be
done in two months this is the
foundation that I want to use up it's
the one I'm currently using I have been
blowing through my foundations this year
I feel like I've used up to so many
foundations this is from Tarte this is
the Amazonian clay
colored clay liquid foundation in fair
I cannot tell where I'm at I know that
I'm definitely it's not full because
it's not easy to like get the product
out anymore this has one of those like
mesh kind of things like they do with
the powder foundations and I've really
been enjoying this foundation but I
definitely want to get it out of my
collection because when I first got this
I used it like a couple times then just
sat on my drawers so needs to go and
hopefully I might try to like do like
the hot water trick or something to try
to figure out where I'm at but I hold it
up the light and I still could not tell
where it was so hopefully by next update
I can like figure out how to like put a
line on this or see some progress in
that way I'm so sorry about my voice
another like face product I want to use
up this is from nude sticks this is
their like sculpting pencil it's like a
duo set and I'm just focusing on the one
side of the cap that I didn't take off I
just want to focus on the light side so
half the pencil is here but yeah it's
been going so fast I don't know this
pencil goes so so fast because I feel
like I've barely used it but it looks
like I've used a ton of it I did mark
this on my little sheet so let me show
you just for reference I am this is how
long of the product I have so I will be
marking on here as I use more product so
you guys can see that progress and I
started the measurements on all of these
not at the bottom of the page but on
this line so I thought I'd just let you
know in case there's any like project
panning police out there who want to
know where I started um yeah anyway
that's where I'm not in starting with so
I don't think that this will be a
problem to use up I did kind of throw a
lot of like concealer and face products
in here I want to try to use up this
bone concealer from benefit that's here
this is from I've already hit pan on it
and my mom gave this to me cuz she
didn't like it and I just want it gone
it's not that I don't like it or that I
do like it I just I don't need it in my
collection I'm not breaking out anymore
like I was so I'm just gonna try to work
with this and like maybe try it under my
eyes and like work it in with my Beauty
Blender and stuff
I want to try to use that up and maybe I
can even use just this like on my face
and see if that's a way I can use it up
I don't know and then I also want to use
my Maybelline fit me concealer I barely
have any of this left it's like at the
bottom but this has a lot of product in
it and I want to try to like take the
stopper out and really make sure that I
like clean this bone-dry because it's
like my favorite concealer and I really
like it so although it looks like
there's not much product in here I have
a feeling that's gonna kind of go for a
while I have the clear brow gel from
anastacio I'd like to use up this is
like pretty dry already so this is not
gonna be a problem it's kind of like a
give me item because I use it everyday
anyway and it's just one of those things
like I know I need to buy a new one by
the beginning of the year because yeah
this one is like on its last legs I have
an eyeliner from Anasazi and that I want
to use up this is just the noir one it's
a black one this I for whatever reason
it's hard to put the cap back on so I
find I'll come home and I'll be like
putting my makeup away I don't know I
don't know why I'm like looking at all
my makeup but I'm sure you guys
understand and the cap will be like not
closed all the way and I never close the
cap all the way cuz it's just hard to
close it and I don't realize when I'm
like getting ready in the morning at
them in a hurry so this is definitely
dried out a lot and I just want to get
it gone so it doesn't like dry out to
the point of non not being able to use
it on this one this is the line of where
I'm at so from the bottom of this line
to the top of it that is how much
product I have left not a lot so if I
tiling with this every single day I
don't think that I'll have an issue with
using it up so I think that all it'll
just give me kind of a kick to make sure
you use this every day this is just like
a small small item this is the Smashbox
BB cream in the color light I like this
product I got this like mini sample from
Sephora and I just want to clean out of
my kid I bought it this year I'd like to
clean it out before the years over so
that way it's just like why did I say
kit in my collection um I just want to
get it out of my collection before the
year is over since I got it this year
it's like it's not hanging around for
like years and years smears its little
it should be gone in no time I have to
like primer type
this is the YSL Touche Claud blur primer
I did a review on this from Influenster
cuz that's where I got it I'll link that
down below
I was not necessarily like a fan of this
product I didn't use it up I do like the
smell of it um I usually like putting
this with another primer like something
that's more oil controlling underneath
it and then putting this on top and I
find that that makes it definitely work
better for me I like the like smoothness
of like putting makeup on on top of this
but I definitely don't think it prolongs
my aware of my makeup or anything like
that so um definitely won't worry
purchases but I just want to get my you
know not my money's worth because I
didn't buy it but I definitely just want
to use this product up so it doesn't go
bad and just again I got it this year
clean it out this year that feels good
this is one that's been hanging around
this is from Korres this is the Greek
yogurt nourishing primer
I don't remember liking this but I don't
know when I tried it and now that we're
going into the colder months I think
since I probably won't be producing as
much oil a nourishing primer might be a
better fit for me anyway so I feel like
it's the best time of the year to try to
use this up so I'm just going to finish
it I'm like halfway that's where I'm at
with the line and I go through a lot of
primer I use primer every single day I'm
a big fan of primers like I love primers
so I don't think using those up will be
a big deal like throw it man like this
isn't even all the products in this bag
but I okay
oh my I have quite a few lip products
because I made a pretty large lip
product goal in that video I ended up
wanting in total to use 15 lip products
up and so I had to throw up quite a few
into this project to try to hit that
goal for the year one of those items for
lips gosh I have too much stuff pulled
up one of those items for the lips that
I want to use up is this Nivea lip
butter and smooth kiss it's kind of like
gnarly-looking so I'm sorry but I've
already hit pan on this a while ago and
I just kind of want to hit pan put it
away
and so I'm busting it back out and I am
going to finish this up I'm gonna use it
by my bedside I'm sorry if you can hear
this footsteps I'm gonna pick you sit by
my bedside say I might help me use this
too so that might be nice a little
cheating going on but yeah I want to use
this product up I feel like it still
smells normal and everything but I know
that if I keep it around too much longer
I'm not gonna feel comfortable using it
so it'll be good to finish it this year
I know that lip product is this NARS
lipstick this isn't Dolce Vita Dolce
Vita I don't know how you say that this
is a really pretty color I wore it on my
wedding day it's just like a sheer type
of lipstick so I feel like out of all
the lip products this will be easy for
me to use up I'm really bad at lip
products they're one of the hardest
things for me to panic don't I just like
lip balms and I'm realizing that more
and more so I'm really trying not to buy
lip products ever really but let me show
you on this little guy where I'm at so
this second line in is the line I have
so I will show you the update once I
start using this but hopefully in two
months I can use this up so we'll see
I threw two lip glosses in here too
I chose little ones like really little
ones to try to use because I I was at
work and bareMinerals we carry their
minerals and they have some sets out
this Christmas in like these sizes and
just from swatching some of them are
like halfway used already and we
seriously put them out two weeks ago so
I thought okay if just like random
people's watching it and not everyone
swatches it and it's already down that
much like okay I can do it geez let's
try this so I threw two in here I'm
gonna try the curious Spreckels method
and I'm gonna like keep it in my car at
least one of them in my car and like put
one on in my car every single time I get
in it so that way it can be kind of like
a reminder to use one of them up and see
how that works we shall see one is in
the color trouble I guess I'll tell you
and then the other one is in the color
Leslie I am basically starting from the
beginning but I've used it a couple
times and I have it
right now and then this one is kind of
in the exact same spot so hopefully
hopefully I can get these used up I'm
really working hard on these lip
products we'll just finish out with the
lip products so this is a little guy if
you've been with my channel for a while
you've probably seen this this is the
two-faced lip injection like super mini
gosh there's like dust all over it cuz I
fell on the floor my house is disgusting
and this is the little lip injection to
face mini mini I mean when I say many I
mean like it it's so tiny
I already took the stopper out I had
this and I finished seven by spring I
believe one of those projects and I
didn't finish it
so there's rarely anything left I'm not
even marking it because I mean there's
like nothing in here so I really want to
finish this up just because it's like a
give me there's barely anything in here
and I can call it a lip product dump it
here I'm just being real with you guys
this is the Kat Von D lipstick again
this was something in a past project pan
that's all I have it's not much I don't
know why it's so difficult for me but it
just is I want to finish it this is how
much product I marked so not a lot of
product I'm really hoping to get that
one cleared out I think I'm the
lipsticks I'm just gonna try to like use
that one at first and then move on to my
NARS one that's the goal anyway well
this one too this is another lip product
this was just in my finished 30 by
Halloween this has like no product left
like nothing like that's it that's all
it's left so hopefully I can get this
one cleared out like seriously in like 5
days and then move on to the others oh
those are all the like products so I
know it's a lot but I gotta get them if
I want I have to get them finished if I
want to hit my goal so hopefully fingers
crossed for me this is an item that
again I'm not gonna finish up I just
want to hit pan on this is a star looks
and eyeshadow in the color pearl and
it's really beautiful it really reminds
me that's as much of it it really
reminds me of my laura geller french
vanilla highlighter
and I've been using that like every day
I love it and I thought why don't I try
to use this as a highlighter instead of
like an eye shadow I'm gonna try to use
this I mean I can use it as an eye
shadow to you but really I'm gonna focus
on using it as a highlighter
I'd really like just like to hit pan on
this I'd feel really great about that
since it's like a brand new eye shadow
like literally i've swatched it that's
it I have four products left guys only
four I know it's a lot so thanks for
sticking in with me I have this brow
pencil I want to use up this isn't like
again this is just a gimmick product
because I color my brows every single
day so it shouldn't be a problem and I
love this pencil so I did mark it down
that's the baby face pencil I put it in
like a favorites video I had it in the
hall so I know you guys have seen it
this mark here is the one that has it on
there I will do close-ups once they're
sexual like marks for you guys to see
but there aren't so not a lot of product
I think I can finish it I don't know I
just I wanted to hit 30 so I threw it up
here this is a product that I haven't
started yet either
either like that one I have this is a
product I haven't started this is
benefits Girl Meets pearl I've had this
for ever and I've never used it so I'm
just gonna use it like with my
foundation underneath my primers like in
between my primer and my foundation I
don't know I'm just gonna use it up I
want it gone it's just been sitting in
there and it's probably really pretty
but I just never have reached for it so
it needs to go then this is my Tarte
eyeshadow base cream shadow gosh I
really can't talk I'm so sorry I've
already hit pan it was in a previous
project so I just want to finish it up
it's just a mini size I can do this I'm
gonna use a brush I'm gonna get it going
and I'm gonna use it in conjunction with
that eye primer so I can still use both
of them together which I'm happy about
but the lid is cracked and I know it's
not gonna hold on much longer like it'll
dry out and I made so much product I've
made so much project I've made so much
progress my gosh
I'm wasn't it again I've made so much
progress on this item that I would hate
to like have to throw it away and not
actually get to say I finished it
because it dried out so I'm gonna finish
it by the end of the year
and that's in shimmering golden
shimmering golden beige this video is
gonna be a must edit the last item I
want to use is actually a shadow from my
lorac Pro mega pro 2 I just got this
shout out I just got this palette and
I'm gonna be doing a haul of just like
some beauty items I've collected
recently because I got some stuff but I
want to use up or at least hit pan on
the color burlap here I think it'll be a
really pretty transition shade I think
it'll go with tons of looks and I just
got this in my collection so I'd love to
see a ton of progress at least somewhere
on it so fast I think that's kind of
cool you know the things that get you
excited
anyway that is everything those are the
30 items that I kind of have in this
project pan I think like what three of
them aren't actually being like finished
up finished up but other than that I
mean I'm hitting pan making major
progress on those items and then
everything else I would be finishing up
so I'm really excited about that I hope
you guys enjoy this project I hope you
guys are general on your projects I will
see you in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
