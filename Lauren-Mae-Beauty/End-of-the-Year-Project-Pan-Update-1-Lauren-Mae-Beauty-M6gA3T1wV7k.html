is going to be an update to my
end-of-the-year project pan this is kind
of a quick update but I've made a lot of
progress and I know sometimes it's hard
to film updates because maybe it's slow
moving progress but I figured you guys
wouldn't mind seeing an update so soon
if there was a lot of progress so let's
get into it I'm just gonna pick out
randomly from my bag just because it is
a lot of products there are 30 products
in this project pan that I'm trying to
finish up and kind of like charge
through before the end of the year my
lorac Pro palette was just kind of
sitting on top so we'll go with that
first
this is burlap I'll do a close-up on it
so you guys can see so there is burlap
you can see a little bit of a dip going
in that pan
I'll kind of move it a little I just
have been using burlap as like a crease
color a transition color along with
melon in the palette and I've just been
using it every single day so that's hype
and making progress on that I also
really enjoy it on my bottom lash line
sorry about all the noise guys sorry
this is my Smashbox contouring trio and
my goal was to finish up this one
completely I'll cover the mirror there
and I have completely cleared out this
side so there is no product on this side
and I'm just kind of working my your
void to finish this product out I'm
excited with this I've just been using
it to kind of set the higher points of
my face for highlighting and then I use
my powder everywhere else and I've been
loving it so definitely I'm getting good
progress out of this I don't think I'll
have any problems using it up this is my
Rimmel stay matte powder I did repress
it and then I have hit pan again so this
has definitely been going faster the
last couple of days so I don't think
that this will take longer I hope I'm
the next update I'll have it finished
another item I've made super great
progress on this is the wet and wild
walking the red carpet palette and my
goal was to use this like creamy pink
shadow up and I have hit pan I hope you
guys can see that I'll zoom you in as
you guys can see there I have fit pan
I'm super happy with this progress again
I don't think I'll have a problem using
it up I must use a lot of it I use it to
set my
I shot a primer so yeah it's been
working well for me this is a tart
liquid foundation I am actually almost
done with this I wasn't sure how much
product was in here but it isn't that
much so I did cut the little netting out
and I'm just working with my sponge to
get what I can out of there I don't know
how much longer I'll be able to use it
because it's kind of hard to get the
product out but I'm gonna try my best
just to scrape this will be done by the
next update for a short the Clinique
bottom lash mascara I'm still just using
this every day but I can't show you guys
the progress same with the gifted Tarte
gifted I am using this everyday I didn't
know how I liked it at first but I am
really loving it it gives me just great
separation on my lashes and I really
like the way this mascara makes them
look but I'm just using this every
single day it is kind of dry but I feel
like the mascara itself just is a dry
mascara so we'll see how long this takes
just to finish out the mascaras this is
the lash domination from bareMinerals I
have not even opened this I will be
keeping this unopened until I finish up
my Tarte mascara this is my berry liner
from Stila I don't have much left of
this but it's just more dense than the
other liners I feel like that were like
this the lilac one and the TKE one so
I'm just working on it everyday put it
under my lash line and smudge it out and
it will be gone but I'm not gonna just
like you know glob this on too glob it
on and get it finished so it's slow but
steady progress this is my NARS Dulce
Dolce Vita oh my gosh I didn't know I
did that
well I'd hit the top of the cap I guess
but I haven't used this at all yet I've
been focusing on other lip products so I
will be continuing to you know use this
in the project I'm just kind of waiting
a little bit I think I'll get a lot of
peace out of it in the next like two
weeks or so I have two items in this
that I didn't realize we're unusable
until I already started the project so
I'm just kicking these out at this point
I'm not gonna replace them they're just
kind of goner so this one is the Korres
Greek yogurt primer this is bad it just
smelt weird I don't feel comfortable
putting it on my face so I am throwing
this one out which is just
that it almost was done I wish I'd just
finish it up when I first opened it but
I didn't so that's gone I can't use it
and it's out of the project the other
one is the tart cream shadow it is dried
up it's gone I know well that you could
put like oil in it I just I don't like
it enough to do that I was just going to
use it and tell it dried up but it's
already dried up which sucks because
this was something that the reason I was
even putting it in here was to use it
before dried up and it's already a goner
I didn't touch it before putting it in
this project I just threw it in here and
when I went to use it it was just gone
so both of those are out of the project
I hate throwing away makeup these are
two items I completely used up this is a
YSL blur primer totally gone I scraped
this the best it could I felt like a
q-tip in there to like scrape the sides
as much as I could and it is done I did
more enjoy this the more I used it I
would never pay the price for it and if
I combined it with an oil controlling
primer I felt like it did an okay job it
just kind of gave me that really nice
slick smooth base but using it alone I
definitely got oily this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer I have
finished this up and I took the stopper
out as well I cannot reach any more
product I've like scraped the sides as
clean as I can get them so this one is
done I'm done with that one there are
just so many items in this project I
like keep pulling things out and there's
still tons left in this bag this is the
Smashbox BB cream I am about halfway
finished with it so I hope it's in focus
I'm about halfway finished with this
product I have been enjoying using this
it's in the light color and it's been
really great I missed it I didn't
realize how much I did so this is
something I am considering repurchasing
once I have like no foundations and
stuff left over this is benefits boying
concealer I am using this right now as
an all-over face concealer under my eyes
anywhere I need it now that my
Maybelline one is done and I am kind of
working on moving the pan down here into
the corner to just finish it up and it's
okay I don't think I would repurchase
this product but I am gonna finish
and I don't like hate it or anything so
this will be done it's just it takes a
little bit more time to use this one up
because it definitely has more coverage
than the Maybelline one this is another
benefit product this is Benefit Girl
Meets pearl I am like a little more than
halfway done with this product I'm
really happy with the progress on it and
I've actually really been enjoying this
I said it might get ready that I don't
think I'd purchase it but I don't know
it is something that just gives this
really nice radiance to the face but
it's not too much radiance where you
couldn't just wear it alone I really
liked it and I was not expecting to at
all but this is something just on my
radar if I I don't know if I was looking
for something in my kit or just in life
that I wanted that radiance this is a
product I would definitely have in the
back of my mind to go to this is where I
am oh my novia lip butter I did hit pan
before I started this project and now
I'm just kind of bringing it down I have
hit pan all the way to this edge and
then I'm just gonna kind of be working
on my way up I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to finish this product before
the end of the year it's just a lot of
product no matter how much I pile on my
lips at night it's just I don't know
we'll see we'll see how close I can get
this is my lorac eye primer I can barely
get product out of this it's definitely
lower than the line that I originally
started on which you can't really see
and I apologize but I'm going to squeeze
this out into like a little jar or
something so that way I don't have to
work so hard at it every single morning
and get all the product up that way and
then I'll just be updating you with that
in mind is what I'm thinking
definitely getting really really really
close on this I didn't know I would
finish this one up so soon but I
definitely think it'll be gone very very
soon
this is my star looks a shadow in pearl
I am loving this as a face highlight I
think it's absolutely gorgeous I also
have been using it on the eyes though
too so I've been using it for dual
purposes which has definitely helped me
use it up and I don't have a ton of
progress but I'll show you see if you
guys can see any of the panic that I've
hit I mean what
I'll see if you guys can see see there's
like a dip going definitely in there
nothing major yet but I am working on it
my Anasazi of Beverly Hills clear brow
gel
I am just using this everyday again this
is something that it's just I'm gonna
use it until the end of the year and
then it'll be done so not worried about
that too more products I've totally
finished up this is my liner antique
it's totally gone nothing left there was
the tiniest little bit left of this so
no one's surprised it's gone but I'm
glad to finally see this go these liners
have been with me a long time so it's
nice to see them out of my collection
the other item comes as no surprise this
is my fresh sugar honey lip balm and
that's it that's just plastic there so
I'm not gonna dig in but it's gone I'm
so happy about that this took a little
bit it was more pigmented than you would
think for just a tinted ball but I'm
glad it's gone I did enjoy it but I'm
glad it's gone this is my Too Faced lip
injection mini I've used this about
three times you really can't see the
progress on it though it's just one of
those things you'll have to trust me
when it's done but I am trying to work
on this it's just not something I like
to wear every single day it just makes
your lips really glossy it turns my lips
red because they're like you know being
plumped but it does work it does plump
my lips
last four items so this is my brow
pencil I'll show you how much product I
have left and then I'll show you it
against the thing this is just gonna
come with natural wear I mean it's not
like I'm trying to use this up any
faster than I normally would that is it
there next to the line so I marked it
from the top like from that edge and
then up to the line so that is the
progress I've made so far on that one so
like a whole line of progress feel
really good about that and that much
progress is really only in a couple of
weeks so I do think that I'll be able to
get this done if I use it everyday next
I have my new Stix face contour stick
basically I'm trying to use up the light
shade and I'm almost down to like I'm
like starting to go into the color line
so I don't think I have much left this
goes so fast if you use this on your
face it just goes so fast so I
definitely would not repurchase this
just by how fast it goes I'd rather just
have like a cream whole big stick not
something so skinny but let me show you
the progress so this is the line for the
nude Stix
I started up here and now I am down to
here in Prague
so I definitely think with consistent
use I'll be able to get rid of it and
it's not like I hate this product I just
don't think that it's worth $24 for how
fast you use it up it just goes so
incredibly fast the next item is my
Anastasia Beverly Hills liner in you arm
this guy is kind of crazy that's all I
have left so from there up not much I
used it to tightline everyday
it is like broken from the base so it's
it's kind of a scary one this is the
line for it so I've used about half the
products since I've started in only two
weeks so this one will definitely be
gone soon hopefully in the next update
and the last item in here is my Kat Von
D lipstick in salafi tarde I've made
some progress on it I'm gonna zoom you
in I definitely have made progress on it
super happy about that you can't see the
tip like as pronounced as much which is
great and there's barely any progress on
it but that's the line there so just a
little bit of progress compared to where
it was so I like those definitely
weren't the last two items I still have
my two lip glosses so let me show you
the progress I've actually made progress
which i think is amazing this one is the
one in Leslie and I know it's not much
but it's something and I've been using
this probably only two three four times
not a ton of times I've really been
focusing on the other one and that's my
progress on this one I can't believe I
can see the tube like through the tube
that's crazy I have been focusing on
this one and it's a little scary to me
though that I've only made this much
progress I know it's only been like a
week and a half since that last update
but I'm just a little nervous I won't be
able to use them up since I only have
like like a good month and week and a
half left so I'm sorry about all the
noise I hope that I'll be able to get
these worked out soon but I don't know I
think they're gonna be something that's
just like a lot of progress but not
quite finished up by the end of the year
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I've
used up I think a total of I can tell
you actually I have already used up four
products in this project I think that's
really great I do think I would use
stuff up just so fast and so soon
plus I have a lot of great progress
going
on all the other items so really happy
about that I will see you guys in my
next video and hopefully they won't see
you in the next you know hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
