is going to be as quick of an update as
I possibly can on my end of the year
project pan project I've been trying to
push as much stuff out as I can at the
end of the year here we are like halfway
through December a little bit before
halfway through December I only have a
little bit left to go so I want to show
you the progress of wearing.i I'll
probably end up only doing one more
video the finale video after this so
let's get into the products that I've
used up and go from there
as we know I had to eliminate two
products in general the Korres primer as
well as the Tarte shimmering golden
beige cream shadow those both were bad
so I couldn't use them so those are two
out of my 30 that I couldn't use I've
used up quite a few more items really
happy about that and then there's you
know we'll see about the other ones
starting off with this this is the Tarte
colored clay liquid foundation this is
Donna cut out the mesh thing that was
there and dug in there as best I could
this is completely done I did enjoy this
it did make me get oily though I
wouldn't repurchase it but I'm glad I
got to use it all the way up this is my
Rimmel stay matte powder it is
completely gone there's nothing left I
repress this and I did enjoy this I will
repurchase this once I use up a lot of
my powders but I really like this one
this was gone in the last update but
this is the fresh sugar honey lip balm
it's completely finished
I really had any left since I rolled it
over from another project but it's gone
I have kind of decided to switch a few
things I'm since starting this so this
here hopefully you can see this is the
shadow I was working on in this palette
I guess said it can hold it this way I
was working on this shadow here just the
top cream one it's kind of a light pink
actually I did hit quite a bit of pan so
I am actually gonna call this one quick
and work on another eye shadow if you
guys have seen my last video you guys
know that I'm working to just hit pan on
as many eyeshadows as I possibly can
this upcoming year so I figured instead
of continuing on with this I would just
move on to another matte cream shade or
a light pink shade or just different
things in different pallets and again
like I was saying in that video see more
visual progress in my collection this
year than I previously had so I like
this and I'm glad that I hit pay
and I'm excited to hit pan on another
eyeshadow it's kind of the same
situation with this one this is the star
Lux single and pearl hope you guys can
see there it is there's that pan I did
hit pan on this as well and I was using
this as a face highlight I also used it
on my eyes I really like this and
although I really like it I'm just going
to again move on and try to hit pan I'm
using another single shadow right now as
a face highlight again just trying to
hit pan and see more progress so it's
exciting because I know I wouldn't have
used this item up at all if I hadn't put
it in this project and it's so cool to
see that I hit pan relatively fast
especially since I was using it for my
face really awesome really happy with
these this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer I use this up in my last
update so you guys have already seen
this I took the stopper out I love this
product and it's completely gone this
one was kind of close to the end also
this was used up in the last one this is
the YSL blur primer I kind of liked this
as I used it the more I use it the more
I liked it but I don't think it's worth
the price at all I love the smell though
this smells so good in the last update I
had finished the liner from Stila
antique and now I have also finished the
one in berry yeah berry this doesn't
roll up anymore that's it it's just a
nub nothing there so really happy about
these I have two or two more in this
style left I'm going to work on next
year so I'm happy I got three out in
total and I have two more left
yeah this is a new item I know it looks
like - since I'm holding up two things
but this is the lorac eyeshadow primer i
depotted it and pushed it all out into
this and now this is completely gone in
here so there's no product I used it up
I will say I don't know if you had a lot
left I wouldn't de pot it because it did
start drying out in this little
container and so by the end it was like
a really thick cream and if I had like a
ton of product that I couldn't use up
very fast
I could see it drying out on me but glad
it's gone super happy about that and
this is done I mean an eyeshadow primer
is a pretty big deal cuz they last a
long time so I'm glad to get one out
because I
have a ton so many I think I only have
two more items that I've used up
completely so I mean guys that's pretty
dang good this is the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills liner this is the noir one and
there is again nothing left I can't like
roll it up any there's like the tiny I
mean I could maybe try to get like a
half an application but it's done
there's nothing left it doesn't roll up
anymore really glad to get this done I
don't like this liner I don't think it's
worth money or any like I don't think
it's good it doesn't stay on my tight
line it transfers immediately onto my
waterline by the end of the day it's
like in my outer corner in my inner
corner so yeah I don't like it glad it's
done though and then the last thing I
believe I've used up this is the Girl
Meets pearl from benefit this was just a
sample size I loved this I use this
between my primer and my foundation so I
put my primer on then I put this all
over my face and then I put my
foundation on I thought it worked really
well it just gave my skin kind of a
luminosity and I just liked the color of
it everything about this I really liked
so I would potentially repurchase this
but I would just need to have nothing
else like it in my collection because
it's I don't know if I would use it
every day and I wouldn't want to have
like ten things similar to it and have
this I would just want this one product
now I will show you wearing that in
other items that I have and kind of
where my goals are for them because
there are some things I don't think I'm
gonna finish sad but it's true
this is my boying concealer from benefit
since last time I have like hit pan and
kind of moved the pan over I don't think
I'm gonna finish this honestly I'm gonna
try to use up like half of it I'd like
to use at the bottom half of it before
the end of the year but are all around
the corners it's all up to the top it's
not like thinned out or anything so it's
just a lot of product and I have been
kind of struggling recently with like I
feel like my face is just like cakey my
glasses move my product around like by
my nose and I'm like trying like Pat it
and blend it in and then there's no
product on my nose and I'm just having
some issues and I don't want to like
kcon product and make those issues worse
so I'm just gonna
focus on trying to use up half of this I
just I don't think it's possible to use
up the rest of it but still happy with
the progress that I have on it we'll
talk about mascaras and brow products
the brow product this is the Anastasia
Beverly Hills clear brow gel I mentioned
before that I am just trying to use this
the rest of the year and then I will get
rid of it it is like on its last legs
and I need to replace it it's been like
it's been going strong like a year so
and I already have a backup so once the
end of the year is over this will
automatically just be done similar in
that same sense are these two this is
the tarte gifted I am getting really
bone dry but I'm kind of just still
weaseling out that product but at the
same time as soon as the year is over I
will be throwing this away it's just
it's getting there but again I don't
know when to say when on mascaras I just
keep going with them this is so this one
will just be thrown out at the end of
the year whenever it gets there if it's
not done before that and again same with
the Clinique bottom lash mascara I've
had this open for a long time I'm just
trying to use as much up as possible it
is getting really dry in there so I
definitely think this will be over soon
that being said I don't think I'll be
able to get to my lash domination
mascara from bareMinerals if the Tarte
gifted one just gives out and I can use
this than I will but I might even not be
able to open this so that one just kind
of standing by still this is my match
box camera ready BB cream I am down to
this line here I'm still really enjoying
this product I just have been mixing it
with other foundations to give it a
little bit more coverage as well as
lighten it a little bit I feel like
these BB creams from Smashbox definitely
run dark so the light is quite dark so
even fair would probably be like perfect
for me so the light is a little bit dark
right now especially in winter so I'm
using lighter foundations to kind of
bring that color up and so I don't like
use a ton of it by itself so I will
definitely finish this up I'm just
working on it as I go we are getting to
the last few products here thank
goodness right this is the Smashbox
contouring trio this is the product I'm
working on so I don't feel like there's
been too much progress on this I have
focusing on the remote powder so I am
just going to focus on using this up I'm
just gonna set my whole face with it
it's actually kind of dark for me I'm
realizing as I'm trying to use it almost
as a face powder that it's kind of dark
for my skin tone and I don't know I kind
of just want to use it up I'm not
enjoying it as much as I was at the
beginning so I'm really happy it's
almost done because I don't want to use
it anymore I will show you guys the
progress now on my lorac pro 2 that is
my shade right there burlap I will give
us a close-up that is it there I'm
definitely a big dip I use it every day
so I'm really hoping that if I continue
using it the way I have been we shall
see some progress on it sorry if it's
still blurry but my camera doesn't
autofocus I have to do this on my own
guys so that's the progress on that one
I thought it would just mentioned since
I have the palette out I have been using
the top shade here porcelain as kind of
my matte all over the lid shade in
replacement of that wet and wild one
it's just easy since this is the palette
I go to every single day to just kind of
use this in here too so that's what I've
been using hopefully I can maybe hit pan
on that one since you use a lot of it
and it's a really powdery but we'll see
I just thought I'd mention I'm working
on that we will talk about the lip
products last but I have two more
products besides those this is the
progress of where I'm at on this this is
like half of one stick that's it like
both sides so my completely gotten rid
of what the color looks like on this
side and honestly I think that I only
need like that much more I don't even
know how far the product stays light in
here so I'm just gonna work on it I'll
probably just sharpen it until it's all
the way gone and it changes to the other
products because I do like the light
shade better than the other shade on the
other side so yeah I think that I'll be
done with this one as well I mean the
caps are pretty close to touching at
this point so I really like this one and
I'm gonna keep going and then just to
show you like a visual reference
I started up here that was the first
update and now I'm down to here and the
product is started here so I don't think
I have too much left on that one the
last thing besides lips this is the baby
face eyebrow pencil
that's what
that's all I have left in product I do
like this so I'm not like upset if I
don't finish it I just thought I'd throw
it in here and kind of focus on one brow
product instead of kind of switching it
up every single day I still really like
this I'm pretty sure I will repurchase
this because it's only like five dollars
and I think that's a great value I feel
like it's lasted me a really long time
as well since I bought it and I will
show you guys the progress on my little
chart so on my little chart here this is
the babyface one so I started with that
much product first update and now the
second update so not much but again I'm
not really you know gonna be upset if I
don't get through this one okay now it
is time to talk about lip products I
threw a lot of lip products in here
there are quite a few I don't think I'm
gonna be able to finish all of them I
knew it was kind of like a big thing and
I've been doing my best
I definitely feel happy with what I've
done so far but it's just there's no way
with how I am with lip products it's
like as soon as I pick a lip product to
be in a project I like will use every
other one and start using any lip
product but the one I picked even though
I only usually wear lip balm super
frustrating but this is my gloss and
Leslie from buxom I am I barely even
used it since the last update so I'm not
even gonna remark it I think I'm gonna
stop using this altogether and focus on
my other lip gloss in here just because
I've made a lot more progress on that
one and I'd rather finish that one up
completely then have like half and half
progress this one I'm gonna kind of just
not use up so don't be surprised if you
don't see any more progress on this in
the finale same with this one this is
the NARS dolce vita dolce vita I never
know how to say it again but this is
there's no progress accidentally smashed
it into the cap on the last time so
that's the only progress that there
really is on this again I'd rather focus
and finish up some other products and
have half and half progress this is the
Nivea lip butter I have made more
progress on the pan on this one so when
I started I had a little bit of pan and
now I've moved it over I'm moving it up
and I'm going on this I use it at night
I even makes a music
help me I used it on my cuticles last
night as well but it's just kind of sick
for that honestly I don't really like
that feeling so I'm just working on it I
put it on every single night I'm gonna
keep doing the best I can I'd like to
kind of just you know move up here and
get all this product out that's kind of
what I'm thinking but there's no way I
could possibly use all of this up so
just gonna keep working on it but I
don't think this one will be done these
are the three of the products that I
actually want to finish so this is my
lip gloss and rebel it hasn't been
sitting up but I did like run hot water
over it and find out that it is down to
here so I made more progress on this one
than I did the time before which is
exciting I'm just gonna focus on wearing
this as often as possible I have it on
right now over another product and I
think that I could if I really worked
hard get this out so it'd be like the
only lipgloss I've ever used up in my
whole entire life which I'd feel super
happy about so I really do want to focus
on using this one up this is the
two-faced little mini lip injection I've
used this a couple times since the last
update but I really I just don't use
this so I need to just use it I just
don't want it in my collection anymore
but I've used it and put it in so many
projects that I will just feel so
disappointed if I just throw it away
yeah I just needs to go this one needs
to go I really want to focus in on this
one again also and get it out before the
end of the year and last this is my Kat
Von D little lipstick you can definitely
see progress on this I've been using
this a lot I really want to use this all
the way up so this has been the one
that's been so difficult to use as soon
as I pick this to be my item I want to
use like Turk or nudes or you know
berries and dark colors and it's like
dang it I just picked as I just said I
needed to use it so I am continuing to
work on this I'll show you the progress
on my little chart
so it's this far one here I started up
there and I'm just making my progress
little by little I'm like half way from
where I started so I think I can make it
if I really focus hopefully we're all in
focused and everything I hope you guys
