learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a full face
tutorial I'm going to be using a lot of
Sigma products I got a package sent to
me recently from them and this is kind
of in conjunction to the review video so
I'm going to leave that link down below
I'm gonna try to upload these on the
same day basically it's just the demo
portion but I didn't want that video to
be massively long so I figured I could
just do two separate videos upload them
on the same day and then if you want to
see the demo you can see the demo if you
just want to see the demo you could just
see that you just want the same way you
could just do that yeah none of this is
sponsored or anything but you know it's
just the way I wanted to do this so I
hope you guys enjoy anyway let's get
started I'm going for a very like fresh
just kind of basic look today we're
using the warm neutrals palette and
there's a couple like different colors
in here but we're gonna be sticking to
the basics I do a lot of color in my
channel so I thought it'd be interesting
to kind of switch it up to something
neutral since they don't normally do
that and I'm going for something just
like glowy and slightly glam but
definitely could be everyday we might
even do some winged liner in this video
I've never done winged liner like with a
gel on camera so we'll see how that goes
but we're gonna do the face first so
let's just get into it
I have already moisturized my skin so
we're gonna go in and prime I'm using
the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot all
over the face and then I'm gonna go in
this is my hard candy primer and what I
have left of it which is like nothing
and I'm just gonna be smoothing that
over my largest pores on my cheeks and
also on my nose and a little on my chin
[Laughter]
for a foundation today I'm gonna be
using something new this is from pur
Lisse and it's the BB tinted moist
I was sent this product I've been using
it the last probably four or five days
and I've really been enjoying it I
believe this only comes in five shades
which is pretty horrible but it is a BB
cream anything that I like about it
though is that it does seem to be a very
equal shade range so they have a fair a
light a medium a medium deep and then a
deep so they at least have that going
but they definitely need more I'm going
to be putting this on with the Sigma 3d
HD max kabuki brush and this is
something that I didn't think I would
really like from a box honestly I
thought this was like a really gimmicky
brush something that no one really needs
but I truly like the way this applies
foundation I like that I have this kind
of like pointed area to get into my nose
here I really do think it works very
very nicely so this was something that
was really surprising in the package
that I I really wasn't thinking I was
gonna like so I'm going to be just
spreading that out pretty thinly I've
been enjoying a pretty light base
recently I just don't want anything to
texture it on the skin like I just want
my skin to look nice and I don't want it
to look like I'm wearing foundation
really I just want it to look like my
skin is really good so I'm just gonna
buff this in
so for me really what that did was kind
of even out the skin tone so I don't
have any places that are really really
red I'm gonna pull my hair back cuz it's
just so irritating I tried wearing it
down for you guys but we'll see how long
it lasts or I'll just pull it to one
side I just kind of evened out some
redness so I don't have anything too
crazy going on for concealer today I'm
gonna be using the Milani retouch in a
race which is something I really enjoy
I'm going to be putting this underneath
the eyes woah that's the thing I don't
like sometimes you can just get way too
much product so this is already enough
product for the whole face and then I
like to just go over any areas that
maybe a little extra redness is coming
through I didn't cover everything I
quite wanted to with the concealer
instead of really packing on a lot of
foundation and then for concealer
specifically I do like to use a Beauty
Blender just because my under-eye area
is pretty delicate I mean everyone's is
but I don't like to be too rough I don't
like to like bring up any texture there
and I just personally like the way this
feels and looks finish wise under the
eye
now I'm going to go in and lightly set
my face I'm using the Becca soft light
blurring powder in pink haze I'm going
to be using this very lightly under the
eyes as well as the rest of the face
this is gonna add some luminosity I do
like this powder but I don't like to
pack it on too heavy because of that
pink cast it can potentially give so
this is definitely not something you
would want to like bake the under eyes
with or anything like that you're just
lightly setting the face with this and
this brush is not from Sigma this is
from ELF I did not get a brush in the
set and I don't own a brush from them
that really serves this purpose for me
so yeah I'm using my ELF lip
for bronzer today I'm going to be going
in with the laura geller baked bronzer
in light and I'm gonna be using the
Sigma F 20 large powder brush this is an
interesting powder brush because it is a
bit tapered whereas the other powder
brush that I had previously from them
that I bought myself was is a lot more
round so I like to use this actually for
bronzer I think it's a really nice big
brush to just sweep a lot of product on
in a thinner more light way while still
blending it out so I'm going to just be
putting this around the pruners of the
face kind of in the hollows a bit and
then I like to discuss it a little on my
nose so that I have a little dimension
for blush and highlight I'm going to be
going into this palette from kiss this
is the ombre radiance natural palette in
grenadine and I really love the shade of
this blush especially with that little
bit of bronzer mixed in and the
highlight is really nice for a natural
Sheen so I'm going to be taking a brush
that I already own and I use an every
tutorial and everything I do I use this
every freaking day this is the Sigma
large angled contour brush f40 I really
love this brush again I've had it for
five six years now and I really enjoyed
the way an angled brush applies product
you can just kind of easily sweep it on
the cheeks and it already has that kind
of like gradient built into the brush so
you don't have to do as much work that's
how I feel anyway so I'm just I always
just like to do like the apples of the
cheeks and blend it backwards and then
for highlighter I don't have a highlight
brush from Sigma so I'm going to be
using my Real Techniques one which I use
all the time this is the contour brush
and I'm going to be putting it into the
highlighter and then just sweeping that
on the cheekbones and it just gives just
a nice radiance without being too shiny
alright so that is my base done I think
it looks really nice natural glowy I
look put together and really beautiful
and luminous without looking like I
tried too hard so I'm going to do my
eyebrows next I'm switching it up
slightly from my normal routine but I'm
gonna go in with the colour-pop brow
boss pencil in the front part I'm going
in with my newer Maybelline pencil in
the second half in the last set of
videos I use just the Maybelline product
and it looked it looked a little heavy
especially in the front so I'm gonna try
this combo haven't done that before
and then I'm gonna be using the elf
clear brow gel in my brows I'm also
gonna go ahead and prime while I'm at it
using the elf
my eyebrows are on my eyes are primed
and before we move into the close-up for
the eyeshadow I'm going to be putting on
a lip moisturizer this is the Clarins
instant light lip comfort oil and I have
been trying to get into the habit of
putting on something kind of
moisturizing I'm not used to having like
a gloss or a bomb on my lips when I do
my foundation so I don't really like it
but I'm trying to do it after foundation
before eyeshadow so that I can hopefully
get them a little more moisturized and
then scrub it all off and then go on to
that lip products so I have better
looking lips we'll see how it goes
I'm gonna zoom soon so we can start on
the eyes so first off I'm going to set
the eyelid and I'm gonna be going in
with the shade humble this is a matte
cream with glitter shot through it I
really really wish it didn't have the
glitter I find that it works fine as a
matte but it would just be a better
palette without that it might look nice
in a picture or something like that but
practicality wise we hate those shades
people we hate them stop doing them
please and I'm just setting my entire
lid to the brow bone
and then just so you guys know I did use
the large shader e60 brush to do that
this is what I find the best purpose for
this brush it's quite large and it's
just a little too big to like actually
lay down a lid for me at least with my
hooded eyes so I like to set my eye
primer with this brush next we're gonna
be going in with one of my all-time
favorite brushes ever this is my Sigma
e-40 you guys have seen me talk about
this a million times they did send over
two other ones but they are a bit
different so I'm gonna be using them
differently I don't know if it's just
with time but I have heard before that
this one in a set is what I originally
bought it is different than if you buy
it individually so I'm going to be using
this and we're going to be going in with
a light shade in the palette it's
between well this one's so pretty but I
think I'm gonna do just a more neutral
look so I'm going in with toasty and
something about this palette you guys
will like is that there really is no
kick up so if you hate lorac shadows or
any shadow that really has some kick up
you will enjoy that this one doesn't
it's more similar to a Mac shadow when
you actually are using your brushes in
it
I think that looks pretty nicely blended
we just sat down the transition color
with that toasted shade or toasty shade
I'm gonna go in with henna now and I'm
taking the regular f40 brush or like the
newer one I have and I'm just going to
be gently doing little circular motions
in the outer portion of my eye and just
kind of blending that we're just letting
got a light base I'm probably gonna
switch to a smaller more dense brush in
a second to really lay down some color
but I just want to kind of introduce
this color and blend it into that
transition
I think that's a pretty nice base I'm
sorry for all the noise just ignore it
please I'm going to be going back in
with my original e-40 brush and just
kind of blending out any edges I'm
probably going to deepen up that brown a
little bit more but as you can tell this
is like a greenish kind of color and I
don't really want to introduce that to
the look so I really find that this is
the darkest you can go when it comes to
the mattes in something neutral so we'll
reintroduce that in a second next we're
gonna go into the shade beaming here and
it's just kind of your classic champagne
type of color and to do that I'm gonna
be taking one of my brushes that I've
bought from Sigma this is the concealer
a 70 brush mine's pretty worn it's
stained I've used it in my kit I use it
in my personal collection I do like this
brush but I like to apply shadows that
are more shimmery and we're gonna be at
foiling so I'm gonna be taking my mac
fix+ and spraying the brush on its own I
don't find this shade to be particularly
anything special you can definitely get
a little bit more of a metallic sheen
going when you use a setting spray and a
flat shader brush I'm gonna be putting
this all over the lid
so that's what it looks like with
basically like one layer and then I like
to go with my finger once I have that
base stone and then just kind of tap
over the color and I find that that
really intensifies it and if I just went
in with my finger it wouldn't look
nearly as intense so I like to do that
to kind of like double layer to make
this shade really really pop to its max
potential I'm gonna wait for the eye
shadow to really fully dry before I go
in and blend the darker shade in again I
just don't want anything to kind of get
patchy or pick up in weird places so
while that's doing that I'm gonna go in
for my inner corner highlight there are
two ways that you can go in and
highlight with the brushes that I have
from Sigma this is the pencil brush you
guys seem use this all the time I had
one before and now I have another one
which I'm really happy about this is
great for highlighting the inner corner
and just doing a little bit more detail
work and then there's this one this is
something I got at generation Beauty
it's just like a little sample one and
it's the shader crease brush very very
tiny you can definitely do some like
nice shading or blending out if you
wanted to for like a cut crease or
something really detailed but I like to
also use this for the inner corner if
you want a more blended look instead of
something really harsh you can use this
to apply and blend at the same time so
I'm going to be using this brush and I'm
going in with the shade creamer which is
right next to the beaming shade and I'm
just going to be running that on the
inner corner and buffing it out onto the
upper lid and lower lids
I think this shade would also make a
really nice highlight if you have a skin
tone similar to mine I don't really have
anything perfect from Sigma to go in and
really do some more detailed work I have
this medium angled brush and I'm gonna
try doing this but again I'm probably
gonna switch to something else
this can help you lay down a shape if
you really want to and so maybe this
will work we'll see I just want to kind
of deepen out that outer edge and bring
this on to the beaming shape that we put
down I'm not the difference with a
little bit more definition and I'm
really using the angled part of this to
my advantage so I'll have it this way
what I'm doing this and then I'll flip
it and rotate it so that I'm going into
the crease and I'm keeping that angled
section to the outer edge I think that
looks really good again we're just gonna
blend a little bit more with the e-40
and then I think I'm gonna try to do
some winged liner I hope I'm in focus
we're gonna try it I don't normally do
that out here I usually always save that
for inside like where I normally do my
makeup so fingers crossed for me guys
I'm gonna show you the different brushes
that I have that would do winged liner
really nice I recently did the winged
liner in my last video with the small
angle e65 I thought this worked really
well and yeah it turned out really
nicely today we're gonna be using a
really tiny brush this is the winged
liner brush and it's the e06 so I'm
hoping I can get something really nice
it's super small super detailed and
we'll see how that one goes I will be
using the Sigma gel eyeliner in wicked
and I've only used this once for
complete transparency but I did like the
way it applied I'm gonna be taking some
on the back of my brush and then putting
it on my hand and working from there
because I might use this in my kit I
don't know yet I just don't want to get
it dirty so I'm going to be working with
a small amount of product on the back
my hand and I'm going to be getting the
brush nice and like you know full of
product but evenly throughout and we'll
see I think this is gonna be very very
fine thin line hopefully it looks good
I'm nervous okay um here we go
[Laughter]
all right so far a pretty good success
there's this tiny little dot that was my
fault right above it but other than that
I feel like I've got a really really
thin line I find though the best way to
do that is to flick outward instead of
inward so yeah that's kind of how I got
that now always the biggest biggest
problem is to map that on the other side
so I'm going to be taking some more
product I'm using a very light amount so
if you saw any skipping it's because
there's not too much product loaded up
on my brush and I'm going to be doing
the same thing to the other side
hopefully I need a little bit more
product it's pretty dry right now so I'm
gonna be adding a little bit more to my
hand and hopefully it can just smooth
out some of those lines and I'm not
going to be taking this liner all the
way into the inner corner I'm gonna kind
of like end it about here
just so that way you can still see the
pretty shade I put on my lid when my
eyes are like fully opened you don't
just see a liner
I think that's the best we're gonna get
I feel like if I mess with it too much
more that it's gonna get like really big
I will say with this brush and the other
brush I did the other day I really enjoy
the precision I can get with a brush and
gel liner instead of with a felt tip
sometimes the tip is not wet enough and
you can't just get that really fine
flick and this has let me be able to do
that without something super liquidy I'm
really into gel liners lately so yeah I
really like the way it looks this is
definitely for me a very dainty wing
usually my wings are like thick and
crazy and amy winehouse which there's
nothing wrong with that sometimes I'm
into that but not every time I do a wing
do I want it to be like the main focal
point sometimes I just want it to be an
accent to the eye shape so I'm pretty
happy with that there are a few little
like I don't know it's not like perfect
but again I don't want to like keep
trying to make it perfect and make it
bigger and bigger in and then it just
turns into disaster I really like that
brush though I think it really helped me
get a nice like even small amount of
product on the inner portion of the eye
as well which I like I'm assuming that
you guys have seen the review portion of
this and I will say though in case you
haven't when I have worn this liner just
the one other time I did get
transferring onto my lid again I have
hooded eyes so that was something that
was kind of you know I'm not sure if
this eyeliner specifically is gonna work
for me but I do like the brushes I'm
gonna keep testing this out and see if
it's just something maybe it wasn't dry
or I don't know I don't know what it was
but I only had it on a couple of hours
and I could see some like gray forming
where my eyelids touched it's oh let's
get this eye look finish because we're
pretty close whenever I do any black
liner on my lids I like to go in and
tightline today I'm gonna be using this
Rimmel wonder ombre pencil just honestly
anything to darken up my lashes I'm at
the base so that way you don't see any
skin showing through so I'm just going
to be darkening them up exactly in the
same places where I already laid down
the liner so that way my lashes can look
nice and full and you don't have any of
that weird gapping and then I do like to
take it a little bit far in on the tie
not on the lid but just underneath on
that flap of skin so that I can still
have some definition on the inner corner
but again you can still see my eye
shadow when my eyes are opened we're
gonna move into the bottom lash line I'm
gonna be going in with the pencil brush
from Sigma and we're gonna take I think
just the shade toasty which is that
transition shape we originally used and
we're gonna buff that under the eye and
I like to keep these colors kind of
close to the outer edge just with my eye
shape not to close it off I'm actually
going to go in with the angled liner and
the darkest brown shade we used which is
henna and I'm just going to be stamping
that on the outer edge closest to the
lash line just for the tiniest bit of
definition
I think last I just have some mascara to
put on I'm going to be using the roller
lash from benefit today and I'm just
going to coat my bottom and top lashes
and then I will show you guys the final
look
oh wow and then we'll do lips I'm gonna
scrub my lips using the elf lip scrub
which I don't think you guys need to see
cuz it's kind of gross so I'm gonna do
that and then we'll come back for the
lips we have some clean lips and today
I'm going in with the blotted lip color
from colour-pop in deja vu this is
something I've had for a long time and I
just forget about so something super
neutral a little bit warm I thought I'd
go nicely with a look again we're just
keeping it kind of basic
and I'm just softening that color with
my finger and I'm gonna zoom out so you
guys can see the final look all right
guys so this is the final look I hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial you could
obviously use any brushes that you have
you can obviously use any palette that
you have the colors that I use from this
palette are very much you know common
colors and a lot of other palettes so if
you wanted to do something similar to
this you definitely could it's a very
simple simple look so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and enjoyed
seeing me put these products into action
along with the review let me know if you
like this format of having like two
separate videos or if you're fine with
just having them in one just going
forward depending I just don't want to
have like insanely long videos I know
some of you guys really like them but
sometimes it's nice just to like get in
get out watch what you want to watch and
move on and if anything you can always
just watch both of them so anyway that's
everything thank you so much for
watching guys and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
