Lauren today's video was inspired by the
two-faced sweet peach ballad even though
I know there's only three like peachy
shades in it even now it's still
tempting I don't know what it is even
though I know I don't need it I still
like I kind of want it so that inspired
me to go through my collection and find
all the peachy pinky type of shades that
I could use and kind of dupe those just
those three shades I obviously do not
have the sweet peach palette but these
are all shadows that I feel like you
could easily use in place of those
shadows or in addition to those shadows
so basically I made this video not only
to show you guys but also to convince
myself even more that I don't need this
palette I did use a couple of them in my
look today anyway I just thought it'd be
fun to revisit my collection look at
some peachy pink golden shades shades I
thought would look great and I'd rather
almost have a palette of all these
shades then have just three with a bunch
of neutrals in the sweet peach palette
I'm not knocking that palette if you
have that palette obviously I'm a little
jealous but with this year I'm really
trying to just buy things I actually
need and things I won't end up on a
regret list later hopefully you have
some of these in your collection some of
them might be limited edition some of
them might be permanent I didn't like
exclude any for any reason I just
thought I'd show you and you can
hopefully be inspired to use them if you
have them or find other pinky peach
shades in your collection the first one
I'm going to be talking about is from
the California roll this is from Wet n
Wild and it was part of a limited
edition collection now the shade
specifically I'm talking about is the
one in the middle over here it's such a
beautiful peachy shade and what I love
about it is that it is matte I feel like
it shows up very very well on the skin
it's a little powdery but I feel like
the pigmentation is there I really like
this shade and this is like a true peach
shade it's very like soft orange it
doesn't have much pink in it and I think
this is a really really good one again
it is limited edition so if you don't
have it I'm sorry but if you do have it
I'm sure part of the reason you picked
it up was for the two shades over on
this side so bust this one out and use
this in place of some peachy shades the
next shades I have to talk about are
actually in the same palette this is the
lorac mega Pro
- this was limited-edition for Christmas
2015 or holiday 2015 and the two shades
that I think are so beautiful and again
another reason why a lot of people even
bought this palette are melon and
tangerine melon is a really pretty
peachy type of shade it's definitely
lighter it'd be a really pretty
transition color and both of these
shades are matte so there's a swatch of
it there and then tangerine is just
basically like a couple shades darker
than that again it is more of like a
true orange and it does have a little
bit of brown in it it's such a pretty
color again I think you could get such a
pretty peach look out of those and they
might be something you already own I
have a couple of the honest Asya
palettes in here at the tamanna' palette
I think that's how you say it I'm not
sure but this has a beautiful color in
here called China rose and that shade is
so pretty it is a true kind of peachy
shade it has a little bit more pink in
it and it also has a really pretty
golden shift to it that's it there it
does have a sheen to it and it's a
beautiful shade this is when I forget I
have all the time and this would be so
so pretty I'm pretty sure this looks
like really really close to one of the
peach shades in the palette so pretty
and then the other color from Anastacio
that I'm going to mention is from the
Amaya mia palette and that is the color
fresh peach this one I believe is a
little bit more orange compared it is
the other one has more pink tones to it
this is also a shimmer finish and I do
personally like the way that China Rose
performs a little bit better and both of
those are just so so beautiful you could
do a really subtle look with just both
of these colors these are from limited
edition palettes and I'm not sure if you
can get them in singles but if you
already have these palettes these are
some other peach shades that you could
use and replacement of the sweet peach
ones I guess quite a few of these are
from limited edition palettes so
hopefully if you bought a lot of
palettes in the past you can kind of
reach into those ones and use those
shades next we're gonna go into our vice
4 palette I was so excited to get this
palette for Christmas and I do really
like it there are two shades in here and
I feel like could pass as really pretty
peachy pinky colors the first one is
fast ball up here and this one is a
little
more pink than any of the other shades
I've shown you but it has this really
pretty like duochrome
it has like a golden pink shift and I
just think it would look so great and
still give you that peach vibe and then
the other one that I thought I would
mention is the color flame this one is a
little bit more yeah it is it's peachy
it's like a golden peachy color very
similar to China rose actually but this
one is a lot more chunky with a little
bit more of that chunky like classic
urban cake glitter really really pretty
I really like that shade I think that's
another shade that was really popular
from this palette and like a reason
people got it and both of those would
definitely give you a really nice peach
look another advice palette that I think
has a color in it that would look really
nice kind of in a peachy way is the
color alien and that one's this one here
and this is from the vice 3 palette this
is the most pink that I've shown you
guys but it does again have that kind of
like golden undertone to it it's very
pink but I think that this will pair
really nicely with a peach and I just
really like it so I thought I would
mention it in this video that you could
definitely get a look similar or
comparable to like a peach look
especially if you just had like a warm
color to kind of warm this up a little
bit I only have a couple more limited
edition ones so I'm sorry this video
again is kind of for me so this is the
Kat Von D Esperanza palette and the
color placebo in here is a really pretty
Coralie almost like a Corley red color
and this one is matte this swatch is
insane it's super pigmented really nice
I really like this shade I like blend it
out in the crease that's how I like most
of my shades but this is a really good
one this one's a little bit older so I
don't know how many of you guys have
this palette out there but if you do
have it this is such a pretty coral pink
shade and I think it's just a little bit
deeper too which is nice and all the
other shades I've shown you this is the
Smashbox insanity gold collaboration and
this palette isn't Apocalypse Now this
is the one that was like blue and orange
that's what it looks like there and this
orange is so pretty and really this is
just a reminder for me to use this shade
this is more of a golden orange color
but again I
just think it's so pretty you would get
that nice peachy look this would be
really pretty for like summer it's like
a bronzy peachy Corley golden change how
many colors can you describe one color
with the next one I'm going to show you
is from the lorac pro 2 palette and I
thought I would give the color nectar a
shout out it's not super duper peach but
this would be a great companion shade
with some of the other peaches I've
mentioned and I think it would just be a
nice this is a very subtle way to add
that like warm kind of peachy look you
can just use this as a transition and
then go in with one of those other
colors but I just thought you know let's
give a full spectrum of kind of that
peachy tone did they don't all have to
be straight up peach but this still
isn't like a neutral like a normal
neutral if that makes sense like and
that's what I wish they did more with
the sweet peach palette was at more
these types of colors and add like more
oMG more pinky peach more golden peach
instead of adding so many neutrals so I
would have rather had less shadows and
had more of a concentrated theme to the
palette next is a pigment this is from
Jessie's girl and this is the pigment in
Sunset Boulevard this is one of those
really pinky golden colors that I feel
like once you have it on the lids could
definitely come off of peachy it's super
duper glittery this is definitely like a
going-out shadow it's like a pink base
with golden shimmers that I think would
look really really pretty maybe I'll do
a look with this if you guys would like
it like all over the leg with some
glitter glue it would be so pretty but
this I just think is like a glam peach
I've I really wonder how many times I
said peachy pink next I have a few
shadows from Coastal Scents so I don't
know if you guys were into Coastal
Scents I have so many coastal side
shadows so I thought I would give a
mention especially if you wanted to kind
of just get a couple peach shades and
you don't want to spend a bunch of money
these are usually $1.99 and then I
always buy them when they go on sale for
99 cents each so I have four different
shades to talk to you guys about this
first one is called reef pink and this
again is kind of more on the pinky shade
I'm gonna swatch them all on my hand
without taking them off so you can
see the differences between them but
this is a really pretty pink shade I
think this would look really really nice
coupled with a warmer peach shade and I
thought I'd mention it obviously that
one is like a satin finish like it
definitely has a sheen to it but it's
not necessarily metallic the next shade
here is called petal peach this is a
matte shade this is such a beautiful
beautiful shade this would be such a
pretty transition shade for like every
single day if you wanted a warmer look
or again if you wanted to blend out
something that was really warm I just
think this is so so pretty and it's kind
of a different take on Beach it has a
little bit of Brown to it but it's
definitely peachy next this is the color
pale nude this is kind of more like the
nectar shade this isn't super like
peachy when you look at it it has quite
a pink undertone but this could just be
for that kind of really soft transition
color I just think this would be a nice
shape to pair well with a peachy I if
that makes sense and you last this one
is reef coral this one is also like a
shimmery finish and it is a little
powdery I will say that about it but
this definitely has more of that coral
look to it compared to the top swatch
and this is just super pretty I think
there are better quality like corals and
peaches but if you're ordering off the
site I mean it's not bad it's just if
you have a blush you could use it blush
but I thought I'd mention it I have this
quad from Lancome and this is I'm gonna
be showing you guys the colors kitten
heel and it is a shimmer color this is
such a beautiful shade and this was part
of like some gift with purchase but I
have a feeling they might sell it
separate if they have a name for it so
this is a really pretty peachy pink
golden shimmer color is so beautiful I
really need to bust this whole quad oh
it's so pretty I really like this shade
and if you happen to have this from
Lancome or I don't know if you want to
look at it this is also one I only have
one more eyeshadow left this one is from
colour-pop and it is in the color animal
I'm not sure if this
limited-edition or not my girl Heather
probably knows for sure love Heather
right here on YouTube I'll have her link
down below she is like obsessive color
pop so she probably knows but this is
this is peach like peachy coral so
pretty and it is so pigmented crazy
pigmented I did try using this in my
brows today because I was trying to find
a different way to use this because I
find I don't always use my color pop
even though they're swatch so pretty it
doesn't really work in the brow so I'm
gonna have to find another way I want to
try to blend this out with like a brush
and see how it works in like the crease
and stuff but this is such a pretty
peachy pink color if that's what you're
looking for and you love color pop this
would be so pretty and obviously you
guys could use any type of peachy coral
blush that you have at home to double as
an eyeshadow as well I'm just gonna
mention one because that's what I use to
do my island today this is from Too
Faced this is the love flush blush in
the color love hangover that's what it
looks like in the pan and this again I
mean it's like all the other shades
hello that's why I made this video to
tell myself you have a million so that's
what it looks like it is more of like a
deeper pink coral shade but this is
really pretty and this is again what I
used to might look today so you can
always use blushes to help you get that
look as well okay guys those are all my
like basically like a look at my
collection of all my peachy pink type of
eyeshadows I hope this helped you and
inspired you to go through your own
collection and look at what you already
have to make your collection work for
you the things you've already invested
in to love those things it definitely
helped me to just realize that I do have
so many pretty options I don't need aa
new palette I should you know look at
what I already have and explore those
options and create some really really
pretty looks so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video let me know if you want like
similar videos to this in the future I
thought this was really fun and just
beneficial for me and hopefully for you
guys so I will see you in my next video
I hope you're having a wonderful day bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
