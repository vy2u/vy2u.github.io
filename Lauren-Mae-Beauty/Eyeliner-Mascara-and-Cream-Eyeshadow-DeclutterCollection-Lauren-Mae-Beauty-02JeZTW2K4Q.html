Lauren thanks so much for watching we
are continuing my decluttering series
and we are going to be going through my
eye products this is like brow stuff I
have like cream shadows some more brow
Stefan mascaras eyeliners color pops
glitter stuff and then this is
everything that was in like kit for I
SEP so my biggest goal for this specific
collection is cigarette of old stuff I
feel like I have a lot of old stuff so
yeah I need to get it gone let's just
get into it I'm going to turn this
around because I want to start over yeah
I'm going to start with the cream shadow
first I'm going to get rid of all my
cream shadows a slop cream shadows the
mouth is all I used I really love the
benefit creaseless cream shadows I think
those are just so good I don't know why
they discontinued them anyway this point
is for Maybelline and it's like a
limited edition lavish lavender lover
use that it's like drying out I'm never
going to use it like it up put a bunch
of base in while my eye so this is the
color pink inked in pink really pretty
but it's old and right up and then this
one from Tarte is just super old pink
champagne it's still creamy but um it's
just old so nageire of it this isn't
really pretty eye shadow from josie
maran
i am going to edges old i'mma get rid of
it I was going to keep it but inches old
then I have all these six shadows first
off my NYX jumbo eye pencils are just
too old I love this one and oyster it's
so very pretty I love it
I would repurchase it but it's just too
old to get rid of that and then this one
is in the color rest and it is also
really beautiful but I just never use it
and again it's just too old because
somebody actually bought since I've been
here so that's good at least it's really
pretty it's like a rose gold color I'm
going to keep that a little bit longer
this is from Urban Decay and this one's
super pretty as well I don't really use
it too often uh
I kind of want to keep that one I have a
purple one here from Laura Mercier and
it's really prettiest in the color
amethyst it's still really creamy and I
do purple look sometimes I want to keep
that one this is from Jane Iredale and
it's just like a weird situation I can't
use it on anyone else because I have use
it oh now I'm going to get rid of it I
don't care about that and lastly I have
a Rimmel scandaleyes and it's like a
gold color it's really pretty and yeah
I'm going to keep that one too so down
just four guys I'm going to move on to
brow products so I'm just going to kinda
like put them up here for now I'm
obviously keeping all my backups of my
elf brow pencil because it's my absolute
favorite I love this this is a real brow
product I do like this I've been using
it so I'm going to keep that this is my
current eyebrow pencil I'm using from
ELF I'm to keep that I just thought this
from Lancome thoughtfully and it's a
brow product as well I really like this
one is this one of my favorite ones I
have this is so old it's my clear brow
gel from August hacia it's basically
used up I just was in denial so I need
this put this on is abuse this is
something I'm trying to use up so I'm
going to keep it this is the brow brow
bow what conditioning primer from
benefit it feels really nice on the skin
like the actual product that comes out
is really nice so yeah I'm going to
actually keep this try to use it up it's
kind of gimmicky but since I have it I'm
going to try it right on top here is a
starlooks quad it's a brow quad and I
there's just so much of it I'm going to
keep it because I want to finish these
up it's basically the only brow powder
I have and I do like it some keep it
this lorac eyeshadow primer is like
almost done I'm just finishing up some
to keep it this is the other eye primer
that I have I was using from Maybelline
and I really do quite like this this
reminds me of the bike carry one so if
you like the that one the hyaluronic one
or you wanted to try it try this
Maybelline one because it's very similar
in feel has a bit of a sheen to it this
is a brow pencil from honest Kavya it's
just a little I'm gonna get rid of that
I have to like brow things as I said
another
idea from on Sofia okay I have three
brow like highlighting pencils and ice
do not need that many this one from
Anasazi is like very pink like cool temp
ink which is kind of nice I kind of like
it and I have been using that one more
recently that's the Milani one they are
those two and then just billion dollar
brows one let me see that I might keep
two of them because they're just
different shades oh wow they I'm going
to keep the billion dollar brow and
honest Asya and I'm going to get rid of
the Milani this is a product come to
faces be candlelight shadow insurance
there's beautiful but it's really old
like I should not be using this on my
eyes so I'm going to tap that I'm gonna
pass this into the garbage it is really
pretty though I do like it I just had
three more products so this elf eyebrow
kit I'm just going to get rid of it it's
super old I don't use it I used to prowl
quad from Starbucks yeah getting rid of
that this is another one of those brow
like gels it's tinted for a Maybelline I
really like this I got this at the end
of last year Lynette brought it with me
home from Arizona so I'm gonna keep it
this is a reputable firm by Terry and I
don't know how I feel about this
sometimes I like that sometimes I don't
I think I might put it in my kit because
of the color it is it's like a very kind
of warm toned blonde so I think I might
take that one and then this one I just
got from kiss and I hated the color of
this let me try to swatch it like I
think this one looks warm toned my hands
like what so not working let me try to
dry it off so I think that one's really
warm toned
oh no look this is like even more warm
tone this is crazy so for me personally
this color does not work on me I like
the formula I like the shape it's kind
of like an oval shape so I'm going to
actually put this in my kit so that way
if I ever work on someone who has more
like a you know red hair or sometimes
that I think this is the NX tensile for
them it just does not work for like
regular long I'm going to keep the extra
things that I want to put in my kit over
here for now back to my brow products
back in the case let's move on to
mascaras I feel like this one will be
pretty easy for me and off the top I
love these from NYX for the brows but
they are super old like they have to go
the only thing I don't like about these
is the fact that they are very like me
like pull your hair is out even though
you're like lower lashline I don't know
I still really like them but these are
just too old I do need to get rid of
them this I also need to get rid of it's
like a I was an eye primer oh I think
this was my mom okay I'm going to keep
this actually I didn't know I had it so
putting that in my eye primer so I try
to use that one up this is like an
eyelash like clamper toner I don't use
that in my kit and I go work false
eyelashes myself so I'm going to get rid
of it this is an eye lash curler I don't
need this I don't use it myself and I
already have one in my kid so I need to
I don't feel like I'm gonna get rid of
it oh shoot this is Katie's I'm going to
give that back to Katie as this Marc
Jacobs mascara and it is kind of old but
I think I want to keep it so now I'm
going to keep that one this is the one
I'm currently using from Eden minerals
everybody's like this so I'm obviously
going to keep that I'm finishing it up
right now
this is one from Jane Iredale I want to
keep it but it is just too old I just
need to get rid of it so sadly this will
be gone this isn't a mascara this is a
cleanup pencil from news stick and I've
never used it I don't keep it in my kids
it's a cool idea
it just doesn't like work practically
actually so I'm going to get rid of it
they're just so old it's like a
two-faced mascara and although it's
sealed it's still so old I still don't
feel comfortable using it some throwing
it away and then laughs is a new stick
mascara and again this is just too old
and I need to get rid of it so I have
like 10 mascaras now yeah let's do a
whiners I'm going to move it around
again I'm just really trying to
disorient you that's really what this is
about I have three like sharpeners I'm
going to get rid of the by Terry one I
just don't need it and I'm gonna keep
the other two because they both have the
big one and small urban eyeliners I
don't even know okay I'm actually I feel
like I don't know what I'm doing and I'm
just going to put them down here and
then hold them up from there so I hope
that you guys don't mind I really want
to be really really like harsh on myself
for this
have some really old eyeliners in here
and I just don't need them so first I'll
just start off with this black up one I
actually just got this from octal II I
didn't get ready with me with it so if
you want such that you all know but I am
NOT going to live a liner to tell you
that this is a beautiful color it is the
color it's just like a number I thought
I remember it just being a number it's
not on here I don't know it's like the
cobalt blue color very very beautiful
but dislike if I don't know I don't like
it I'm not going to ever use it on
myself probably again because I don't
like the formula of it like it dries
down and then it kind of gets like
clumpy and you could like pick it off
and it's not quite opaque in one pass so
if you went over twice and you're just
building up the product and it's just
starting to like build upon itself and
get flaky anyway yeah I'm going to get
rid of that this is a product from
Sephora I've had this for forever it has
glitter in it I hate it I've been trying
to use it up in the loft with two years
and it needs to go oh that feels so good
just a jus a kitten liner and oh it's
kind of dried out I'm just going to get
rid of that one this is probably my
newest liquid liner from wet n wild next
to the black up one and I'm going to
keep this if it's still good yeah
so I at least have one liquid liner we
have one we got one keeper guys I am
almost done at this this is the bronze
Bonanza liner from pop beauty I'm going
to keep it and use it up I really like
it another keeper that I know for sure
this is from Mac it's the color coaster
reach and I just got this as welcome to
keep it this is another one I'm going to
get rid of this is from dolly wink and I
got this I hope this a long time ago
it's still pretty good buy this is old I
need to get rid of it so I'm going to
cap them along and I really don't want
liquid liner so I don't need a ton these
two I'm keeping these are both almost
done one is $19.99 from Urban Decay and
the other one is a steel white wine or
so I want to finish those up this is a
color I've been working on for a while
remember the K in the color stash I'm
going to keep that as well I have two
wet and wild eyeliners here and I'm just
never going to use them so I'm going to
pass
you can use those in the brows as well I
have a gray liner here and this wasn't
like it when I got it from school and it
I don't know this is just something I
probably never going to use I'm just
going to get rid of it I have two liners
from Stila and these are getting a
little old res you want to keep them
because they're really pretty colors the
first one here this is I want to say
kitten or something it's just really
pretty it's like a different type of
eyeliner it is angelfish and I'm going
to keep that and then this is a really
pretty silver and silver dollar so I'm
going to keep that this is something
autumn sent me and I'm going to keep
this as well because one side is like a
cream so I can use it on my waterline to
help open my eyes it's not as bright as
white but it will do the job and then
the other side is just a nice deep brown
liner so I do like those I have a couple
liners here from by Carrie I don't know
which ones I want to keep so I'm going
to swatch them and go from there
I kind of think I might keep this cobalt
blue one just because it's so different
I've like never really used these oh
they're all so pretty though okay I'm
going to get rid of this one because
it's a little bit chunky this is the
color Neal indigo but I'm going to keep
the other two blue liners not that I use
them a lot but just in case I'm going to
keep these and I did get these more
recently not recently but more recently
than these ones I guess and even my
Urban Decay liners and I'm going to try
to be good and get rid of some of these
you would think that would be this color
but it's darker so and I'd get rid of
this because I have to buy cherry one
this is the one I think I might keep
it's a really pretty like Keeley blue
green it's nice and bright so I'm going
to keep that one and that's for the
color deep end in case you're wondering
this is the color Mars and I am going to
I don't know it's really pretty I'm
going to swap the rest is another green
one here this is in the colors junkie
oh that one's pretty too and okay stop
that would be easier this is the color
LSD and they're so pretty though why do
they have to be so pretty similar and in
this one is the color psychedelic sister
really pretty purple and last is the
color tornado which is like a deep
purple I feel like I can get rid of
tornado
I don't want to make a decision between
like Mars and the other ones other
Greenland but they are different I'm
going to keep them all for now okay I
did it I did my best guys we are moving
on to the last section of Michael my
personal collection which is this stuff
here and then we'll move on to my kit
first off I have like these liquid
liners that are like glitter lawyers I
have to get rid of this because it's
just so old I don't want to but I'm
going to because you know being a
healthy safe person and then these I
need to get rid of as well I don't use
these ones and they're just too old the
other glitter liner is newer to me I
didn't love it in my first impressions
but I haven't used it since then so I'm
going to keep it and see if I can use it
again I mean it's just like an
iridescent kind of like glittery silver
color
I don't know magenta and see if I like
it because it's not like too old the
glitters I'm going to keep all my
glitters this is the zodiac glitter from
one crime and this is the color oh it's
just so DF glitter it's not like they
have one for each zodiac wait I thought
they did I don't know this might be Oh
see up PS I don't know man I don't know
it's the holographic line I have some
glitters here for the body I'm going to
keep those as well
I haven't been nice litter I'm keeping
and then back here are a couple little
vials that I'm also going to be keeping
is letters to make like hair glitter and
just different things like for more like
Halloween makeup I don't know I just
love glitter so wasn't it are the color
pops MMO cities are really recent so I
don't know how much I'm gonna get rid of
but yeah we'll see this is the color
weenie so pretty I'm going to keep that
and I also I mean I like the super
trough formula it's just for me I just
never use it I don't know why so I just
started series on my channel where I try
to use like color pop stuff up so yeah
I'm going to try to like get better at
that this is the color mix tape and it's
a little bit different for me but I'm
going to keep that one it is like it's a
nice like one shadow look that's it
swatch there this is the color Kennedy I
really like this it's a matte I'm going
to keep it this is the color 8-track and
I really like this color I think this is
the
I want to do a look with like necks I
just I really like it so keeping that
this is the color stereo and it came I
think with that set this one's not my
favorite I think I'm going to pass this
one on it's Kara like a black bass with
like burgundy glitter I don't need that
one
this is the color desert and I really
like this one it's like a satin so
really pretty I'm gonna keep that one so
this is Cornelius and also going to keep
that guy I like the matte formula but I
will say I feel like they're starting to
dry out already which sucks and this is
the color static and I do like this one
definitely better than 8-track so I'm
going to keep that guy I have the color
glow here and I like this color but it's
just a little too dried out for me right
now so I'm going to get rid of that this
is the color Sarah and it's like a nice
like dark brown it's super dark so I'm
going to keep that just for like
different looks I have the color Bay
which I've had for a really long time so
I need to get rid of it and so it's so
pretty I'm not getting rid of it I don't
care I'm keeping it this is the color
bandit it's a really nice warm Brown
it's a matte color see that one's like
not as dried up as the other ones I
don't know what that's about this is the
color M Nye I think maybe and it's
pretty house like this iridescent like
purple shift to it but it's just a
little too dried out like so little to
go on this is the color party time
it's like a purpley color I don't know I
kind of like keep that one for more guys
four more to go through let's see this
is the color bill and I do like this one
as well it's like a nice it is swatch
that great to enhance the wood but it's
a mat like purpley color this is white
rabbit a really really pretty color like
that was super beautiful this is the
color elixir and I really do like this
color as well that's a swatch of it
there it's a matte and then last I have
the color let's see
Donna which my mom's name it's really
beautiful too so I'm going to keep that
we are moving on to the last section
here that needs to get too cluttered and
these are all things that keep them on
kit so I don't
know how much I'm going to get rid of or
what but you know we'll just kind of see
this is my Maybelline eye studio I
really do like this I want to upgrade to
something else like a leader on the line
but I'm going to keep that I'm keeping
my eyelash curler this isn't a mascara
so I'm going to keep that this is the
waterproof because the last short I did
was like in the water and stuff plus
it's always good to have a waterproof
mascara in your kit I'm keeping this
tool as well just like a Sephora strap
again this is a new eyelid under eye
primer I'm going to keep it in there and
just you know I've been using it it's
okay I don't like love it but it's not
like bad or anything I just haven't been
like a lot of my lips haven't been
meeting stuff like this I feel but it
was nice this is something new I got
from Stila I use this on Katie for the
premiere for second Wives Club and it
was so pretty love this I'm going to
keep this in my kit as well which is
meant to have something like fun if
someone wants like a pop of sparkle this
is a Mac painterly and I use this on the
basement to keep that I love these elf
routes cool so I am going to keep these
in there I love using me this is a chill
out eyebrow gel this is this getting a
little old time just going to get rid of
it
most the time I'll just use hairspray
anyway I have the duo eyelash glue so
I'm going to keep that I have this black
and make it forever liner and it's just
like dried out I don't know what's wrong
with it so I'm gonna have to get rid of
that this is a laura geller brown
eyeliner and it's really nice I don't
know if I'm going to keep it in there
let me see what other ones I have going
on I have this Urban Decay 1 in the
color Rockstar just as like a different
option and it is really nice this is a
newer one I just added I just wanted
like a cheap eyeliner since that other
black was just like crapping out on me
it's from Le girl and it's super black
and it stays on really well so I'm
definitely keeping that now this is the
color creme from Urban Decay and I
really like this as well it's like
something a bit different than just
straight-up black so yeah I keep that in
there as the NARS nude pencil I'm going
to keep that in there as well and then
this is another eyebrow pencil and I'm
going to keep that in there as well this
is from YBF
and it's nice it depends on like people
shape of their brow sometimes the else
one can maybe be a little bit too big or
I want to create more like actual hair
strokes I'll use this I found this
actually right now this is the color 0
from Urban Decay does I have a la girl 1
I'm going to actually get rid of this
one I feel pretty good about that
actually I'm going to get rid of this
Rockstar one too also I took the laura
geller one in my question to use up
instead of in here yeah so let me show
you guys what we are seeing this is what
I'm keeping cheer mascaras
I got rid of prior to eyeliner they feel
like definitely quite a few oh because
alone I get extra on let me move these
so I four more Brown products um add
some color pop yeah I know you guys saw
what I did the bra products are a little
bit more weeded out I guess kind of and
then the final thing that we're the most
excited about is all of them getting rid
of I'm really happy about this I'm going
to go through with row away what I need
to and then whatever I can pass on I
will pass on I feel very very happy
about that
thank you so much for watching guys I
believe right next to clutter is going
to my last one probably going to be a
bit longer because I'm just going to be
doing like all my eye shadows like
eyeshadow palettes and just everything I
shadow related and I have a lot of
shadows so yeah I'm really excited for
that I'm going to be very cutthroat so
if you're excited for that that will let
me know down below I am this is like the
one I'm most excited to do which you
would think I'd be scared but I am
excited anyway that's everything thanks
