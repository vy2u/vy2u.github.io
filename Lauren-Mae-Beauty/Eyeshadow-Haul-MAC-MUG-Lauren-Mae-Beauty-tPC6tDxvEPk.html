it's Lauren this is going to be a Hall
of eyeshadows now we all know I didn't
need any eye shadows but I just
declutter dat unev stuff and a lot of it
were single shadows that I'd been
holding onto for a really long time and
I also didn't order anything through the
Sephora vib sale so I figured that I
deserved it 1mon i got some mac
eyeshadows and some makeup geek
eyeshadows so i'll share the mac ones
first so awkward it's so easy to hear
everyone in our neighborhood like it's
just close knit will call it that and
it's kind of late so I know they can
hear me and I can hear them so so here's
a quick look into my shadows I'll open
it up it is kind of dirty so I apologize
but it's because i use my Z palette so
that's why it has some good use to it I
don't know how these eyeshadows moved
hmm there we go that's better so all of
these ones here are Mac and then these
ones are makeup geek now I ordered the
mac shadows because I don't really have
a large Matt collection I've wanted to
try mac eyeshadows for a really long
time and throughout the years I have a
couple I probably have about seven but i
feel like i got them all in weird ways
and i never was like at a max or ordered
them online so since they dropped their
price from i think it was like fifteen
dollars before 26 for the pan i was like
i'm gonna go for it plus stephanie from
the days eagerly i will leave her
channel linked down below definitely go
check her out she does project pans and
all of that and show her some love she
did a mac top 10 eyeshadows and it kind
of just pushed me over that I was like
okay I gotta do it so I'll go through my
mac shadows first I only ordered five
and then I also ordered a palette for
them which I kind of regret the palette
only because I don't know I knew that
makeup geek shadows and like those type
of shadows at Fitness a palette don't
really work with the mac ones but in my
head I'm like I'll make it work like
because I want it to work in my head
it's going to know that doesn't work
that way you know magnets don't follow
that logic yeah so I kind of regret
having the palette but I'm going to make
it work
I don't know I didn't get the inserts
because I wanted to fit more shadows but
now I kind of wish I did because it's
kind of thick and I got the double-sided
one so anyway let's just get into the
shadows the first one I have here is the
color ho and it's built a ju-x very you
know risk I that name isn't it this is a
really pretty matte shade it's kind of
mavi it reminds me of mauve in the lorac
Pro palette very similar to that color
not necessarily like you know must have
but I think it's super pretty I'm
excited to have it in my collection I
think it's just something a little
different I haven't heard a ton about
that one I seriously was doing so much
research watching so many videos with
Mac shadows in it to try to pick out the
ones I won because I knew I didn't want
to make like too big of an order so
these are the ones that I felt like I
don't know I just really wanted from
those videos anyway this is the color
antiqued this is probably the one I
could do without but for whatever reason
it was like one I just felt like I
couldn't live without so I bought it
this is just like a really pretty like
copper color and it kind of has a
redshift to it in the light I really
like this it is really pretty I probably
have a ton of shades that can dupe this
so I don't necessarily like suggest the
shade if you have a large collection I
mean I don't like regret it or not gonna
return it I think it'll be really pretty
but yeah I mean it's an eyeshadow it's a
brown eyeshadow that one does have a
shimmer to so you know the next one is
so so beautiful this is stars and
rockets from Mac obviously these are all
mac ones right now this is such a pretty
color it's really hard to see there do
you think it will show up s with a base
but it shifts like a blue and kind of a
pink it's just beautiful definitely my
kind of color it is not the same as
Urban Decay's tonic that's like one of
my favorite eyeshadows ever it is
different enough from that one so I mean
if you really like these shades you
could have both but I just I had to pick
this one up this one is like me and an
eyeshadow next is the color rule this is
a matte color and this is a really
pretty orange I feel like this is just a
couple shades deeper than honest asya
Beverly Hills shadow and orange soda you
guys know that's like one of my all-time
favorite shadows ever i love these warm
colors you guys know that so this one is
definitely something i'm really excited
to have in my collection and honest
i don't know if i have anything quite
exactly like this I might have stuff
that's similar but you know as an artist
each shade of stuff Ron and the last one
here is sushi flower this is another one
on Stephanie's top 10 list so I
definitely wanted to pick it up it's the
top swatch here I think this is a very
lightly pigmented shadow but I kind of
like that about it I think it's a really
pretty crease color and I do think this
look really great in the brows and kind
of focused on the inner you know brow
bone area I really do like this one
again it's a 1 i'm really glad to have
in my collection just a little like
overview of how i feel about the mac
ones because i never like had it on the
mac shadows it's kind of hard for me
because they're just so different than
so many of the formulations I don't want
to see they're not pigmented they just
are hard pressed and I feel like
sometimes it's hard to like get a good
swatch but something I do really like
about them is they aren't super powdery
they don't kick up a bunch of shadow so
I feel like they're gonna last you a
really long time and it kind of gives
you a little bit more control to kind of
build up that color and blend it out and
just be more precise with your
application so i will say i think i like
makeup geek better so in the future
unless i really really want to shade
there are a couple shades i want from
mac that i don't have but i'm probably
gonna stick to make a peek just because
i personally feel like I'm more used to
that formula and i just like that the
pigmentation is there just so
immediately but I'm not like hating on
the shadows I got or anything it's just
definitely something I've learned I just
like crazy pigmentation like immediately
that's just me now went to the makeup
geek shadows and I got 12 shadows for
making Peaks I did go a little crazy but
these three are the only ones i ordered
individually and then these ones i got
in a bundle which was really really good
deal it came with nine shadows and it
was forty percent off the retail price
if you bought them all separately which
i thought was amazing and then with the
makeup geek site i also found a coupon
code online for ten percent off so that
was super awesome I don't know how often
they do coupon codes like that but it
made me feel really really good like not
only are these cheap plus i got the
bundle and the bundle for me was an
amazing deal and i'm really happy
although i couldn't pick the colors in
it you know i did look at what colors
were coming in it and saw that a lot of
those i would have ordered separately
some of them were the foiled shadows
which are more
so it definitely was worth it to me and
if you like kind of a mix of neutrals
and a mix of color I think you would
definitely like it so if you like the
shadows I'm about to show you definitely
go on the site and order it before it
runs out on the clearance section I
don't know how long I spent on there I
don't know how long it will be if it
sold out right now and I'm uploading I'm
not sure since I just talked about the
bundle will just go in with the bundle
shadows first the first shadow in that
bundle is shimma shimma and this is a
super popular one I've heard about this
shadow so much it's a really pretty
champagne highlight shade you could use
it on the lid I have to say this is not
one I bought the bundle for was just one
of the ones like oh yeah I'd be okay
with having that color so it wasn't like
a negative for the bundle this is so
pigmented and I know everyone says it's
super pigmented but it's really really
beautiful I personally don't love it as
an inner corner just because I at least
lately I've been loving something like
stark stark um this is like a little too
champagne II but I love it on the lid I
think it's so pretty so creamy and
pigmented and it's not even one of their
foiled shadows so really like this one
and I think this is a great basic I feel
like tons of people would like this so
it's nice that this came in the bundle
the next shadow in there was phantom now
this is one of their duochrome shadows
and this is one that I wanted to pick up
this is one of those shadows that is
kind of like white looking but then it
has like a purple pink duochrome flash
to it I don't know if my swatches are
going to do it justice so hopefully you
can see it this one is super duper
pretty the duochrome in it is definitely
pretty dang intense like it's pretty
dang intense so I really like the shade
this is one that I was like I was going
to order it separately so awesome it's
already in the bundle so pretty dual
crumbs are just beautiful the next shade
is bedrock now this is a matte kind of
light grey shade this would be great as
a transition color for any cool toned
look so you were gonna do I personally
don't do a ton of cool toned looks but
since this was a matte color and not
like a shimmer gray I still counted this
as like a positive i probably wouldn't
have ordered it separately but i
definitely don't think it's like a dud
in any way what I'm doing makeup on
other people sometimes their skin tone
or their preferences or you know
obviously different than mine so I
definitely think I'll be able to use it
and that's why I like that it's matt i
just feel like it makes it more
universal even though it's not a color
or tone that i would normal
gravitate to all of the makeup geek
stuff is super pigmented and it did have
a little bit more powder kick up than I
expected I mean it's not as bad
necessarily as lorac but like when I use
my fluffy brush and some of these
shadows I do have a lot of kick up in it
like gets in my palate but I am used to
that with other shadows it's just
something I wasn't necessarily expecting
but I think I've determined i like that
more than if they're too hard packed in
the pan anyway let's move on one of the
shades i showed you in that trio that I
picked out myself wasn't true I switched
to so sorry the next one here is peach
smoothie this is one that I was wanting
to get already so again this is like a
positive for the bundle for me this one
is one of those like classic makeup geek
shadows and everyone talks about uses as
a transition I really like the shadow I
think it's a really good necessity I
think it works really well to blend out
shadows I will say this is not a dupe
for Anastasio Beverly Hills orange soda
for me that shade is just more orange
than this and I really like it a little
bit more orange I still like the shadow
I don't regret having it and I'm glad
that I got to know if this was the same
or if it was different than that one so
I still want to order that shadow once I
completely finished the one up in my
blush palette but I still like this one
and I mean I'll use both but it's not
the same if you wanted to know but it's
still really nice the next one in the
palette was my tie or in the bundle this
one is another one of the duochrome
shadows this is a super soft one and it
is kind of powdery that's it there I
mean it still swatches beautifully and
goes on beautifully it's just that when
you put your finger in it definitely has
like a coating of shadow this is one of
those ones that is like a peachy golden
shift to it it's really really beautiful
kind of if it has like a bit of almost
like a purple once it starts shifting so
this one I would have picked out on its
own just because I feel like I do have a
bunch of other shades similar I mean not
exactly but just you know it wasn't on
my must-have list but I am really glad
to have it it is super beautiful so that
one is in the bundle okay the next one
is so beautiful this is Pegasus this is
something that was on my list of things
that I wanted to get at least in the
future like it didn't have to be this
order but since it was a part of the
bundle that also made me go for it this
is one of the foiled shadows so it would
be ten dollars individually that's it on
my finger insane I can
to do a look with this that's it there
it is absolutely beautiful I really
really like it my voice guys I'm really
really excited to do a look with this I
think it'll be so pretty on the lid and
I don't know I don't have anything quite
like this like that shimmery that
metallic looking three more shadows I
guess I'll clean my hand off so that we
have some fresh watching areas the next
one is also a foiled shadow this is in
the spotlight this came out with the
first set of foiled shadows add makeup
geek had ever done and I did already own
the shadow so I have the one that I
actually got just like sitting in my
drawer untouched as part of my like
unopened products like drawer that I
have a lot of shag the one that i
actually have touched this is such a
beautiful shade it's the perfect if you
love that light metallic lid color this
one's so pretty and it's not to golden
so if you find that a lot of them are
really golden this one is more peachy
but it doesn't look too peachy once you
put it on I feel like it looks more
peachy in the pan that does when it's
like reflecting the light so beautiful
definitely like a must-have for like a
neutral palette especially if you want
to do like neutrals but a little more
glam this one is absolutely beautiful
I'm telling you this bundle is just so
nice the next one is also a foiled once
you get three foiled I shadows in this
bundle which would be thirty dollars by
themselves and this bundle is
thirty-nine dollars i believe for all
nine shadows plus i got ten percent
awfully pleased masquerade that's what
this one is this is such a pretty color
and this one compared to caitlin rose i
believe is the other purple shade that
one is more cool tone this is a warmer
purple and so i personally prefer this
one you know I feel like I hear people
say all the time that Purple's are
really really hard to do so i'm not
going to say your and say like it's the
most pigmented thing ever like look at
the shine it's super pigmented don't get
me wrong but i definitely feel like you
almost want it to be a little bit more
pink I still love this shadow and for
the ways i'm probably going to use it by
like blending things out and you know i
probably would use this more sheer
anyway I definitely don't think it's as
like foiled as the other foiled shadows
that i have just letting you know my
opinion on that but i still really like
it i definitely like the tone of this
purple definitely really pretty and this
like a bonus to me just because for the
bundle just because it was a more
expensive shadow so to me it like up to
the value of the bundle and the last one
that was a part of that nine shadow
bundle this is the color Neptune this
one is so so pretty it's am at cobalt
blue color super duper I mean for this
color that is so pigmented I'm really
happy with this I think over a white
base does it be so beautiful I
definitely think the white base is going
to make it just pop even more but I
definitely think for how hard it is to
get like a matte shade and like this
type of color to show up true from the
pan I think this is an amazing shadow
I'm really excited to do a look with
this maybe like a winged liner with like
a tape technique but with like shadows
so it's a little more smoky a little
more blended out I think that would be
so pretty with this okay so those are
all the ones in the bundle now let's
move on to the ones i ordered separately
there are so many shadows i want after
making this order like it took
everything in my heart not to freakin go
and order more shadows especially
because she just came out with 18 new
shadows I'm like stop it you're making
me broke the next one I got was cupcake
this is a matte pink color it's kind of
a dusty pink I feel like that makes it a
lot more wearable to me this is like
mauve if it was pink from the lorac Pro
You Mooji here on YouTube she does like
a French smokey eye type of look where
you just do like the darkest shade close
to the lash line and kind of blend out
into your lighter shades I've been doing
that type of shadow look with this as
one of my transition colors as well as
another shadow in here and then another
makeup geek shadow I'll probably be
doing like a tutorial on it soon because
I have really been enjoying it but I've
really been liking how that adds a
little bit of warmth and something like
a little unexpected to that look without
being like in your face so if you want
to like explore color but you don't want
to go too crazy I definitely suggest
that one because it just adds a little
bit of something to your look without
being too you know out there next is
desert sands this originally came out
with the Vegas lights palette that
makeup geek did but this is now
permanent I can't with this killer it's
so so pretty it is definitely like a
warmer shade but it's like a camel brown
color so it definitely has like a lot of
yellow to it a little bit of grain to it
this is the other shade i was using in
that
kind of smoky eye so so pretty I really
love the shade I definitely suggest the
shade so beautiful The Last Shadow makes
me kind of sad like I wish there are
more to show you because i wish i had
more this one here is the color black
light this is the one like my number one
like shadow I wanted to get from makeup
geek this is an exact deep for Urban
Decay tonic and i will say i feel like
this formulation is even better as in
it's more pigmented it is a little more
powdery I feel like then the Urban Decay
one but if you are looking for that
shadow but you wanted it like a cheaper
alternative this is an exact do so
definitely pick this one up if you don't
already own urban decay tonic I love
putting this over moister from NYX the
jumbo eye pencil it makes this pop so
much and it's so beautiful it just makes
this just like super pigmented super
true to color so that is like a super
simple and cheap way to get a really
awesome look and I'm really happy I got
that color even though i have Urban
Decay's tonic it's definitely color I
gravitate to all the time and I'm kind
of glad I can be able to tell you guys
like that it is an exact do I know that
if I hadn't ordered it I would have
liked in my head been thinking about it
and dreaming about it at night okay guys
those are all the shadows that i ordered
recently for mac and makeup geek i am
gonna be adding these to my yearly like
makeup totals for what I bought for the
year I'm super happy with these
purchases and I'm just excited to have
these like I'm i love them and I'm
really happy that I'm so blown away from
them again it's not that I needed any
shadows we all know that but I'm just
happy that I'm really in love with these
I'm really exploring bodega beat shadows
and if you want to see like a fool like
collection video of my makeup geek let
me know or my mac let me know I mean
it's not a ton but I could also do like
I know some of you guys have wanted to
see like my palette so I just put these

everyday palette and what's in there if
