channel this video I'm super excited
about because it's a tag video this is
the eyeshadow junkie tag I don't exactly
know who started it so I'm sorry but I
was tagged by Betsy here on YouTube her
makeup channel is make up your mind
definitely go check out her channel if
you like project pan videos you'll
definitely like her content and she's
new so go show her some love and if
you're looking for new people to
subscribe to or watch definitely check
her out let's get into this tag I tag
everyone if you want to do it you do it
girl or guy you do it i shadow junkies
unite and let's do this time I tried to
be organized but we'll see how that
worked out
question number one your favorite
drugstore line for eyeshadows that would
be the Maybelline eye studio quads
I love these they are almost all
shimmery so that's something to keep in
mind but pigmentation wise I think
they're super amazing I'll swatch them
that's a couple from this quad here
which I picked out a few of my favorite
quads this one here is taupe temptress
this one is virtually violet and there's
a couple swatches of them there I'm
sorry my lights like blowing it out
sorry but that was like purple shades
and then this one here is irresistibly
Ivy which i think is a really pretty one
hopefully this is a little better this
is irresistible ivy that's that quad I
mean it's I think the quality for the
drugstore is quite top-notch and I
definitely suggest these I have a lot of
limited edition ones I have like
probably over 20 in my collection and I
think they're great I specifically or
especially like them for the highlight
shades they all have a super shimmery
like lighter shade and those are my
favorite shades at the drugstore I like
using those for inner corner highlights
or even face highlights you could do it
I don't think they should be ten dollars
though so if you can get these
definitely get them like buy one get one
half off or with coupons or I got a lot
of mine online on Amazon for about like
$5 a piece that I think is a very good
price for them question number two is
favorite eyeshadow primer I don't
have a particular favorite eyeshadow
primer I definitely need some type of
primer or base that's going to stop my
shadows from creasing so I decided to
tell you guys about the benefit cream
shadows these are my favorite you guys
know that already this one's in top
brass that's it there I'm working on it
this year to pan it by the end of the
year but I think these are an amazing
cream eyeshadow formula it's not too too
wet but it's still very creamy so it's
not going to tug at the eye if you have
drier eyelids I feel like it's still
going to look good on your eyes but it
also keeps my eyeshadow from creasing so
I could go all day with just this on my
lid and it would increase I like to use
this as a base and top shadows on top of
it so this would be my favorite primer I
like that it does two things at once
and yeah I love this one number three is
your first eyeshadow purchase and do you
still have it I don't remember my
absolute first I have a couple of things
I remember having in my collection when
I was like super young so one is like an
old old Milani eyeshadow and like a
white color I don't know I remember my
dad went with me to buy makeup he bought
me some makeup like I needed makeup and
he went with me and bought it for me um
and I bought this like stark white
Milani eyeshadow I also remember having
one of the flirt I shadow they sell them
at Kohl's and it had like really
interesting packaging and I had that one
for forever like so long it was like the
only eye shadow I used it was in like a
bronzy color and I don't have either of
them now because I have so many other
things but I did have them for like ever
and it was only once I started getting
into makeup that I finally was like okay
they can go for is best drugstore eye
shadow dupe eye I've never had to like a
look in the dupes before I've just not
done dupes so really fast I went through
my collection and I tried to find
something similar to something else
which I'm sure I have a ton of dupes we
all know I have like a ton of eyeshadow
but I think I found something close
enough I'm the type of person that a
dupe is like exact like finish color
everything hue tint it's the same thing
that's a dupe to me so I don't know if
I'd call this a hundred percent a dupe
but it's close and it's the one I'm
going to show you I am gonna be duping
sapphire from the Anastasia Beverly
Hills lavish palette that's it there
it's a really pretty color and then I
kind of have two dupes for it so they're
both from Coastal Scents this is spiced
berry that's spice berry so it's really
similar it maybe is a little less pink a
little more Brown and the other color is
also from Coastal Scents and this is
raisin berry and that's it there so that
one's just like a little darker too very
similar colors though the reason I chose
this one as like a dupe color is because
I feel like pigmentation wise and
metallic wise and all that I feel like
they're very comparable quality in that
sense just the color is slightly off on
them I'm gonna be looking into kind of
scanning through my collection and
really finding some dupes for different
palettes I'm thinking about trying to do
the Kat Von D mi vida loca remix palette
as well as other things so if you're
interested in something like that or you
think that that's something cool then
maybe I'll try to do some more of that I
think it'll just be another way this
year for me to keep loving my collection
if something comes out trying to do bit
number 5 the question is most underrated
drugstore or most underrated eyeshadow
and I went kind of with Lena I will link
her channel down below but I love these
quads from Physicians Formula
she has like a cooler toned one and this
one is classic nudes I love this I think
this is an amazing drugstore find
they're all matte this is like a warmer
quad and I think this is so great for
transition type of colors I feel like
the pigmentation on this it's kind of in
the middle it's not insanely pigmented
where if you put it on the eye you're
taking forever to blend it out but it's
not sheer so I just really like these if
you're looking for a transition color
and you don't want to spend a ton of
money this is amazing I think that
honestly I could do this or my Naked
basics I don't need both in my life and
I just I think this is an amazing quad
I've gotten lots of use out of it and I
definitely suggest this I don't hear
about it nearly as much as I feel like I
would or should because it's matte I
mean it's everything I feel like people
want at the drugstore but I don't hear
anyone talking about it the next
question is favorite single
shadow I kind of cheated and I picked
two sorry the first one here is going to
be the L'Oreal infallible amber rush I
don't use this nearly as much as I
should but this color is so beautiful I
think especially the fact that it's at
the drugstore is amazing that to swatch
of it on my finger I mean look at the
shine and that's it's watched there I
think for your money
you're getting an amazing amazing shadow
this is something that's definitely
high-end quality and you can't beat it
so I really love this shadow I think
it's so nice to have such a nice like
rose gold color it's super on-trend and
a popular color at the drugstore and the
other shadow I wanted to mention was
this one from makeup geek this is in the
spotlight I was wearing this in my last
video that's it it's like you can't see
it cuz the light and these both are
reflecting the light so much but it's so
pretty it's like the perfect champagne
shade it is more peach than gold which I
personally like on my skin and I just
think this is amazing the foiled shadows
are so nice and although they're ten
dollars I think they're definitely worth
it I love those shadows I love those
champagne you type of shades I think
everyone likes those types of shades on
the lid and stuff so those would be my
two like just all-time favorites if I
could only have a couple shadows those
ones I definitely would want to have the
next question is your favorite cream
shadow I already showed you the benefit
one which is my favorite game of shadows
formula so I thought I would show you
the liquid eye shadows these are from
josie maran and i absolutely love these
let me shake them up I have two
different shades I think these are an
amazing formula they're light on the
eyes but they have such a great metallic
sheen to them you can also build them up
or share them out depending on what
you're looking for in your look so oh my
gosh I am so upset
it broke oh my gosh I am so mad right
now I'm so mad I don't know if I should
edit this in okay well mine broke the
little doe foot applicator that comes
with this broke off which is upsetting
because honestly the amount of times
this I mean it has some good use but not
like I'm not like jabbing it on my eye
I'm gonna return this do you think I can
return this at Sephora like as a
malfunction product well I'm gonna
swatch it anyway this one that one there
is Playa del pink and this one is that
one that I just watched with my finger
here this one is rio de rose gold i've
never heard of them doing that before
though so i don't know if that's normal
or not anyway i like these but i wish it
didn't break on me right now
so annoying moving on from that disaster
we will go on to my favorite neutral
eyeshadow my favorite neutral shadow is
on associate beverly hills
orange soda this is it there i know you
can't see it i've hit so much pan most
of you might not think this is a neutral
but for me it's so neutral it is like a
creamy orange shade but i love using
this as like a transition i can't even
get a swatch for you guys so i'm sorry
but i love this shade i will repurchase
this shade once I run out of it and I
finish up a few more shadows but
honestly I don't want to not have in my
collection I just love it so much it
just pops the eye I think it makes any
look just beautiful warms up the crease
warms up that like just top crease so
even if you have like a neutral look
entirely if you just run a little bit of
that in the crease oh it makes it so
much better so yeah that's my favorite
neutral eyeshadow sorry if you don't
think that's neutral but it is to me
girl
now for my favorite colored eyeshadow I
don't think this will come as too much
of a surprise to you guys but that would
be tonic by Urban Decay I love this
shade so much it's absolutely beautiful
it's kind of hard to see cuz again my
lights are so bright but I love it it's
so beautiful and if you can tell I've
definitely made like a dent in it
already and I got it this year I love
this one it's something that I wear I
like to put it like in this part of my
eye I love that like in the bridge of
the eyebrow and nose it's so pretty to
me I just love it so definitely tonic
like with a hands down without a doubt
my favorite colored eyeshadow the last
question I feel like is the hardest
question we're all eyeshadow junkies
all the shadows that we have we have
some type of love for but if I had to
pick the best eyeshadow palette ever if
someone had no eyes shadow sand how to
tell them what to get if I had no I
shadow sand I needed something if you're
trying to create neutral looks if you're
trying to create maybe just like some
more shimmering festive looks if you're
trying to just have an overall great
eyeshadow collection in one palette I
have to go with my lorac Pro I have to
honestly I feel like any of the lorac
Pro palette the one the two the mega Pro
one the mega Pro two would all be
amazing choices and you could just pick
one of those based off of your color
palette or your color preference but I
if I had to give one and like the exact
suggestion I tell you the one I love the
one i love that it's warm there are
still some cool looks in it too though
so I feel like you could definitely do
so much with this I've hit pan on two of
the shades in this palette and I wasn't
trying to pan it this year I just love
this I think it's amazing I think that
it works for all ages I just love it I
think this is the best eyeshadow palette
ever like that you can buy at the store
all in one not one that you create
yourself so I I love it I love it okay
guys I hope you enjoyed this tag again I

some people down below who have already
done this tag so that way if you want to

choices you can do that and I will see
