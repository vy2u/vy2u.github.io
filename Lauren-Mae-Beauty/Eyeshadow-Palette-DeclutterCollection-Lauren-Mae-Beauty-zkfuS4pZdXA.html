Lauren thanks so much for watching I am
going through my eyeshadows today I
thought I was going to do this and like
on my pallets together too but I'm going
to be doing these smaller ones and then
I'll do a separate section for my large
ones because it's just too much my goal
is to be ruthless in this part of my
declutter let's just do this let's just
jump straight into round behind single
shadows build my way up into the rest of
all the goodness in here the first out
here is Urban Decay's tonic and I am
going to be keeping that I really do
like the shadow it's beautiful and I've
already hit pan on it so this is a
shadow from Ulta and it's really pretty
but I've never really used it I just
have so many other shadows so if you
want something like this this is the
color camel it's nice it's a good matte
it feels nice it's a good transition but
I've never used it some and it passes
this is something for Maybelline and I
need to just get rid of it it's a chic
Naturals and champagne is really
beautiful but I need to get rid of it
same with this covergirl this is in
tapestry taupe this was like everyone's
favorite I've hit pan on it it's really
pretty but it's just getting too old so
it's gotta go this is a single of my
Anasazi orange soda I'm keeping that
it's just like a backup I have this
Feliz kit in here this is a bit older
but I am going to keep it I think it's
super pretty
so yeah I'm gonna keep that this is a
glitter from body ography I'm going to
keep this as well I got this from
awfully I really want to do a look with
it it's so pretty yeah I'm going to keep
that super pretty and it's newer this is
the shadows on Tuesdays I really like it
called magic mushroom I want to keep it
so bad but I know I need to get rid of
it it's old so I'm going to get rid of
that this is the color Anya from
Illamasqua and I don't have anything
like that so I am going to keep it it's
so beautiful and super pigmented my hand
is wet so kind of weird but definitely
not I have a cap on be single here this
is in the color on the road I believe
it's one of those duochrome like beetle
type of colors where it's like green and
red and kind you know like those colors
I'm going to take this right now but if
I find something similar in a palette I
am going to pass this on I think this is
like a cool color so I don't want to not
Abuk but I don't use it all the time I
mean I definitely don't need multiples
of it
this is Larsen girl lactic and I kept it
for so long because like I want to use
it cuz it's beautiful
so you know what I'm going to do I'm
going to put this on my highlighter
drawer because that's really what I want
to use it on and if I don't use it as a
highlighter then I'm going to pass it on
later this is a shadow from the Lamia
that Heather sent me this is the color
of Bella Mandarin I think this is super
pretty and I'm going to keep it it's
really pigmented I think it'd be nice
like as a one color all over the lid so
let me keep that hi
this is something from babyface and I'm
going to get rid of this I have on your
nails I got all I need this it's okay
but I'm not going to use it this is the
one of my favorites this is from L'Oreal
it's the infallible on amber rush so I'm
going to keep back Valley it's getting a
little old but I'm going to keep it I
like it this is a TV shout out it's
beautiful this is the color temper
temper but this is like old school plus
look how pigmented that is why can't you
please do more of this type of stuff
like they're both so beautiful it breaks
my heart but I need to get rid of them
and then same with these guys I'm going
to be passing these along as well I hit
pan in both of them there's a few like
countless color pigments this one's in
the shade under stage and this is an
indie um they're pigmented they're
really pretty but it's just yeah I'm not
going to reach for them anymore in some
Senate panel I feel like I kind of like
conquered these and I need to move on I
think them for the joy they gave me and
now I am getting rid of them that was
pretty good guys first English honors
I'll just go into this one max it's like
kind of the mouth next thing first here
is Pascal coffee I'm going to be keeping
this I just bought this at the beginning
of the year and I really do like it so
I'm keeping this is the modern
renaissance
I absolutely love this as well I've hit
pan on three of the shades like such a
great neutral palette definitely keeping
map this is where it gets a little tough
I have the Tarte showstopper palette
very pretty it's perfect for like in my
kit but I never use it so I'm going to
pass this one on this is the Tarte in
the rain forest or one of this rain
forest after dark palette I love this
I think the blushing hair is beautiful I
love the shades in here um I really do
but I don't really use it anymore
I don't know I don't know if I should
keep this guy I'm gonna but this is a
maybe pile because I did really like
this at one point but I'm not sure about
it I have the urban decay the Great and
Powerful oz palette and I got rid of
some of the shadow what I'm going to do
is I actually have some of the single
little shadows and I think I'm going to
maybe just keep the certain ones I want
or I don't know I'm gonna I know I have
another urban decay palette so maybe
I'll save this till I get to that one so
I can hopefully maybe only keep like
this palette or that palette I can keep
like the packaging on this or you know
what I mean because they use a little
like pop out thing situations so anyway
I do want to kind of convince this but
we'll see until then let's go through
these this is the honest Alvia to mana
palette I think this is really really
pretty I'm going to keep the bad guys
I'm also going to keep the Maya Mia
palette I know like the shades in here
as well the lavish palette now this is
just too old
I picked pan on the shades I wanted to
hit pan on I'm going to thank this one
for its service and is a joy it brought
me but it's time for it to go okay cool
I feel good about those decisions I'm
gonna leave this one out until we get to
the other urban decay that's pretty good
right guys I think so like when I look
at these I'm like oh I love all those
you know that's what this whole thing is
for let's move on to these shadows here
I have a feeling I'm gonna get rid of oh
this is the Smashbox like santigold
palette I'm going to get rid of that I
never use it this is a NARS duo in
kalahari I am going to keep this I do
use it in my kit and I just like this
one so I'm gonna take that guy this is
an oldie but I feel like is goodie yeah
I'm going to keep this I feel like this
is such a like underrated product it's
just like easy not very pigmented which
sometimes I just want this is the
Physicians Formula classic news I quad
so I'm going to keep that guy I have to
a little situation from Too Faced it
breaks my heart I like love the shades
but do I ever use it no no I don't I'm
going to pass it on it seriously like
this one is really hard for me it's
really hard
get rid of it this is from to your face
I'm going to keep this one I know that
sounds a little bit older but I don't
care
this has really nice shoes it's great
for just like a I just want it I just
wanna keep this one guys almost doesn't
maybe finally I know maybe I'll convince
myself to not keep it because I really
don't use it but I just want it I don't
know why I want that so much I don't
know why the colors like when I look at
it it makes me want to keep it for thin
like why don't I use it you know I have
to wet and wild pellets here I'm going
to keep the California roll I want to
keep this one to exact color so pretty
I'm going to maybe keep it this is a
beautiful palette but I don't know so
pretty though I don't know guys
dang it I thought these would be so easy
I thought this would be like a one and
done and get them out of time I don't
know ma'am I'm going to keep basically
these one round ones I can't get rid of
them I don't know what is wrong with me
I keep these okay that means I'm just
going to get rid of all these are not
even all around because you don't make
me want to keep them so I'm getting rid
of always labeling Klaus I'm going to
keep this those are just ones I can't
part with yet I can't do it I'm trying
to be good guys
it's not easy let's move on to this back
corner this is something I just got from
kiss and it is a palette in the color
pink nude these are actually pretty dang
pigmented I've only used them in that
one video I think they're nice I just
don't know if I'm going to use and
that's the only thing I feel like if I'm
going to go for like these types of
colors I would go to my Modern
Renaissance but I do think they're good
quality
I'm never launching them for just a
little bit longer just because they're
new and they're actually a good quality
so let me keep that for second longer
yeah I'm lobby for keeping my peanut
butter jelly palette I love this thing
so pretty and I use it a lot so I'm
taking that guys this is the Kat Von D
Esperanza palette and this is a
beautiful palette the packaging is
absolutely gorgeous this is what it
looks like inside
it is definitely older and I feel like
so many of these shades are very chunky
this color here chunky this color here
it's a pigmented that's kind of chunky I
don't know I'm going to get rid of it
now breaks my heart it's just one of
those things like again makeup expires
you can't keep like if I kept it it
would literally just be for packaging
and that's not really my gettin so I'm
going to be getting rid of it
break from a little heart it's just the
quality you know her quality has just
triple folded you know quadruple folded
over the quality in this and I thought
that was good at the time you know this
is a Smashbox palette this is the cover
shop palette in a blaze I do really like
this so I am going to be keeping this I
just got this like more recently I mean
they just came out more recently so
keeping that this is the one I do not
know what to do with its cap on you
ladybirds
it's absolutely stunning absolutely
beautiful it's creamy and pigmented and
I don't know what to do guys I don't
know if I should keep this I don't know
what to do I don't know what to do
that's a little master disguise for
y'all I'm gonna keep it I can't I don't
know why I like love this thing so much
but that I never use it like use it if
you like it use it people love it let it
go like these are so pretty I would
definitely use that though I'm gonna
make this one of my one month one
palette and I think that will definitely
give me a better idea I'm actually going
to like want to use it more than just
keeping it because it's so pretty to
look at so I'm going to keep it for now
but I will be putting that in a 1-1
palette you will see that soon we are
moving on to the last section here it's
this back corner hopefully all can see
this is a makeup forever palette it came
with four shadows I don't understand the
hype on the shadow okay like they're
pigmented yes they swatch very nicely
let me like yes these are very pigmented
yes they still act very pretty
I just never used these colors I should
have just bought individual shades that
I actually would have used and then
forgotten olaphis I bought them so I am
going to actually pass this on you guys
didn't think I was serious did y'all oh
yeah I'm serious
I means business guys it's funny that
like I want to keep these over that is
not crazy I just have some like oh
here's those urban chaos okay
see what's in here oh yeah I got those
crazy shadows with glitter bomb I have
like solstice which is beautiful have
like white shimmery one which is also
really pretty it's like a purple guy
it's okay and then I have this black one
called Zodiac Scorpio I think okay so I
know I like two of them and then what do
I like out of this one out of this one I
think I also like for sure like these
like I like these two because they're
like iridescent and really pretty so I
want to keep that and then I like this
gold and silver duo because they're like
crazy pigmented and really cool so I
don't want to keep those too
let me swatch the others okay I'm going
to keep everything in here right now and
your number is going to pop the two I
want to keep in here also in here so
it's like a palace I don't know I kind
of wish I just had these dudes jingles
oh this is just really pretty I wanna
use it as a highlighter and then the
pink I guess I don't need the pink
I think I'm gonna get rid of the pink so
I want this palette I like this palette
better than the Oz one I'm going to move
this into a single shadow container
because I have one and we can even see
like half of what I'm doing for it's
alright
I'm keeping the peachy one but I'm going
to put it into a single shadow kerbin
casing and put in my highlighters I'm
going to be keeping four of the shades
keeping solstice I'm keeping you shade
cosmic I'm going to keep the shade aura
from The Wizard of Oz palette and then
I'm keeping those I'm going to keep the
shade odds as well so they're just like
different if you're like so I'm going to
keep those and then for this I'm going
to put these ones back in and get rid of
these I don't eat soup and that's crazy
be more like $20 views I was high when I
bought these okay there is enough once
belong to these pre-made palettes from
Sheila these are the nine palette
that this is like that all matte palette
I'm going to keep this guy Matt pallets
come in handy I just want to keep it so
I'm going to keep it and then the other
one I'm also going to keep this too this
is the sole palette I feel like this
would be really nice in my kit actually
like this is what people want you know
to something like nice and like not like
crazy dark necessarily but you could do
some stuff so I'm going to keep these
guys and then these I have a bunch of
like little depotted shadows I need to
like really take a hard look I think I
want to keep two of these two-faced ones
this one here in leading lady I've
already hit pan I love it it's beautiful
I just love this shadow so I kind of
want to try to finish that guy up these
other ones I kind of want to keep any of
like the matte cream ones my hand is
still wet tan yet why do I always do
that I kind of want to keep any of the
matte cream ones because I feel like I
could just go through a room so maybe
I'll keep three this is the color heaven
also on that cream just beautiful so I'm
going to keep those three other ones I'm
just going to get rid of like they're so
soft and nice we all keep those four and
make a little quad these are so nice
okay I'm getting rid of this one for
sure I'm getting rid of this one I am
getting rid of this guy as well this is
really pretty it's from urban decay the
pigmentation is not there so getting rid
of that this is a yeah B shadow I don't
care about it I'm getting rid of it this
is something looks like old
it's like iridescent but it doesn't
matter I'm getting rid of it and then
we're sitting here with these NARS
shadows and I think I'm just going to
get rid of them I don't really I don't
know feel like I bought these because
they were NARS and I left the muscles
all cosmetics wholesale I kind of like
this shadow but these like golden ones
okay guys so pigmented them meet I don't
know I don't know I'm going to keep on
saying it they're so pigmented man they
are really pigmented if they look
beautiful I'm gonna keep on I'm gonna
keep them a little longer okay sorry
guys sorry you're disappointed in me
well now that's what it looks likes a
little better and the last thing here we
still got to decide on is the Tarte
rainforest after dark
palate I think I'm going to keep this as
well and just make it a part of my one
once one palate just so I can just feel
a hundred percent on getting rid of it
so I'm going to keep this for a little
bit longer and then I will decide so
this is what I'm keeping guys I feel
really good about that definitely a
little bit more thinned out again this
is everything from like what I keep in
my kit I belong on personal collection
and we will be moving on to big palettes
neck so that rules we'll see how that
goes and then this is everything I'm
getting rid of so much stuff so lots of
limited edition stuff that I feel like I
was holding on to lots of single shout
out quasi never going to use really
happy about that and then I'm also
getting rid of all these little shadows
so that's great too I really hope you
