learn thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk about pallets I'm
glad I didn't purchase some things you
need to know about me I am an eyeshadow
girl I love eyeshadows and I love
palettes I love singles I love
everything when it comes to eyeshadow
hello I'm wearing like a crazy blue
smokey eye right now I just love them
that's what my favorite part about
makeup is that's what tempts me the most
when it comes to new releases and so
when I see a new palette or I hear new
palettes gonna be released I get so
excited and I am like waiting to see the
inside and maybe even after I see the
inside of that palette I'm like oh my
gosh I totally wanted it's a pretty look
at that color look at this color and I
totally feed into the hype and I get all
excited and so I do a couple of
different series on my channel I do a
new Beauty launches where I talk about
new products and tell you guys if I
think I want to get it or if I don't and
just kind of my overall thoughts on it
and I also do like a wish list I do a
couple different things where I talk
about products and so I thought I would
come back let you guys know about what
palettes that maybe I was excited about
at first but in the end I'm really glad
that I didn't pick up and the reasons
why so a tiny bit of a disclaimer if you
got one of these palettes and you love
it it's your favorite I am so happy for
you that is amazing
makeup is different for everyone
everyone's collection goals and needs
and what they want when it comes to
makeup is different just because I don't
like it
or I'm glad I don't have it doesn't mean
that you should not have it or you
shouldn't be happy that you do have it
if you use it and you love it that's
amazing
other than that let's just get into it
so the first palette that I'm really
happy I didn't pick up and that I was
you know really excited for couldn't
wait to see and even after seeing the
release of it I was excited is the Fenty
Beauty galaxy palette there's a couple
reasons I'm glad you didn't pick this up
one of them is that this is a lot of
topper shadows which there's nothing
wrong with topper shadows necessarily
they're just not my style I don't want
to a palette that has a ton of those
in it they're just not something I want
I want more full pigmentation I'd rather
have a metallic or a matte the only time
I really want something like that is if
it's gonna be really extraordinary and
although these might be for some people
to me the colors in here just kind of
seem dull the more I looked at it the
more I saw it I just felt like this is
colorful but not in the way that I want
color
I love brights and just different things
and to me these are like doing color in
a muted way and so I really thought they
didn't pick it up for those reasons I
think I would definitely not use it I'm
sure I would just be irritated by all
the glitter fallout and everything like
that on top of that I know this is on
sale right now on the Sephora website so
I'm glad I definitely didn't pick it up
at full price there's a ton of stuff on
the Sephora sale site as you guys know
from that video so I'm really glad I
didn't pick it up for those reasons the
next palette that I am glad I did pick
up is the Kat Von D Saint and sinner
palette this one was hard for me I saw
it and I was like I'm so excited the
packaging is absolutely stunning and the
colors in it although they can look a
little jumbled I still got the
inspiration I definitely think I could
have done some looks with it but overall
it's just I'm just I know I'm happier
without it it's an expensive palette I
think it retails for $62 and which is a
lot of money and overall I'm not missing
it in my collection and if I'm being
honest with myself I think I wanted it
because it was Kat Von D and that
doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be a
good fit for me and my collection and
what I want at the moment so I'm really
glad I did not pick that palette up the
next palette is the Too Faced peaches
and cream palette this was an all matte
palette super pretty very warm toned
super on-trend I think a lot of people
really enjoy this palette and I'm glad
that so many people have it and enjoy it
I think it's a very practical palette
especially considering all the other
ones I'm going to bring up it has shades
that I know people are going to use
every single day whether they combine it
with another palette or do their entire
look with this palette but for me
I just I know that if I scour my
collection when it comes to the palace I
already own and the singles that I
already own I have all of these shades
probably like triple so I definitely
didn't need it I think if I had it I
would use it but I I don't need it and
so I'm glad I'm saving my money for a
palette that is something special to me
that is something unique that inspires
different things from me and all of
those shades as much as they're pretty
they aren't very inspiring to me so I'm
glad I did not pick that one up the next
palette that I'm glad I didn't pick up
is the Anasazi of Beverly Hills Prizm
palette I did get subculture and I was
disappointed with that palette the
formula did not work for me and my needs
so when Prizm came out I was excited
because the colors are really pretty I
loved the Sphinx is that what it's
called I love that electric green I
loved the mat like ashy lilac in it but
I did a LED stupid on it so I'm gonna
leave that link down below and I duped
it with colors I already had in my
collection so I really don't think
there's a need for me to have it when it
comes to the colors on top of that when
I really single out shadows from a
palette it's easier for me to break down
and realize I'm not ever gonna wear that
shade oh yeah I'm not gonna wear that
shade either just the color combination
is inspiring but what am I actually
using in there what am I actually
excited to play with and see if I can
find that specific color in my
collection instead of going out and
buying that entire palette so I'm glad I
don't have it I feel like throne and
some of those other shades I either have
similar colors too or I probably
wouldn't wear very often so overall I'm
happy I don't have that palette the next
palette I'm happy I didn't pick up is
the color pop Golden State of Mind
palette I was really excited that color
pop was going into Sephora I loved the
color pop press shadow formula you guys
know that but I'm glad I can pick this
up because it's very very shimmery very
very glittery it's all shades that I
have and the reason I was excited about
it was again because it's at Sephora
like how cool is it it was a support
exclusive for a while now you can get it
at the colour-pop website so I was you
know I was thinking oh I want to get it
because it's the color pop and so for
one look how cool is that
but I'm so glad I didn't pick it up I'm
definitely not missing it in my
collection color pop has just been going
a little bit too crazy when it
so the palette releases for me I'm like
okay you need to like step it back
it's just too much I can't buy every
single pallet that comes out like at two
a month it's crazy
so I'm overall I'm really glad I don't
have it I enjoy the palettes I do have
from colour-pop but I never want that
one to be one that I own I have two more
palettes to talk about the next one is
the Hooda Beauty desert dust palette
this is the one that's probably the most
tempting for me still even I did do a
let stupid on this palette as well so
I'll leave that linked I think this is a
beautiful palette do not get me wrong if
you have it and you love it and you
enjoy it I'm so happy it's beautiful the
price point on this is just too
expensive for me sixty-five dollars is a
lot of money I do have the Hooda
obsessions palettes and I do like them
and I think they're really nice and I'm
glad I have them but when it comes to
that metallic formula of her shadows I'm
not a huge fan and so I'm glad I don't
have the whole desert dust palette which
has a lot of that shadow formula in it I
also think that the colors as much as
they're beautiful I do have a lot of
dupes for the colors that I really did
like in there so yeah I'm glad I didn't
pick it up although I think it's so
pretty to look at it's definitely
inspiring I love the combination of
Shadows and yeah that one was a hard one
and the last palette that I'm glad I
didn't pick up is the Natasha's and
known as sunset palette now I do have
the Leela palette and I have a whole
review on it I'm gonna leave that link
down below I'm just not a Natasha Genoa
like eyeshadow lover I think that
they're okay but I think that they're
very expensive for the I just think
they're too expensive they're too much
money for me for what I want in my
collection I think you get a ton of
product and I know a lot of people just
like swear by them and I'm so happy that
that there are people that love them
they do have a unique sparkle to them
but just they're not worth it to me I
like finding makeup that is on a good
deal that's inexpensive but performs
really well like that's what's exciting
to me about makeup and so that palette
is kind of like the opposite of that and
I just wasn't blown away with the looks
and the quality so for again that price
so I'm glad I didn't pick up the
set palette for me I know that the
colour-pop yes please palette is like
perfect enough you know what I mean I
don't need those other shades so I'm
glad that I didn't pick it up I'm glad I
tried out the Lila
and I'm kind of like alright I tried it
I tried it it's not my fav so I don't
feel like I'm missing out when other
palettes come out okay that is
everything those are all the palettes
I'm happy that I didn't purchase you
know as makeup releases you kind of have
to be picky with your money you know I
don't have the money to get everything
so I need to be picky and find the
palettes and the makeup that's really
gonna make me happy in the long run not
something that I'm just going to have
and swatch and put my fingers in
immediately and be so excited about but
things that six months later a year
later I'm so happy that I picked up so
that's what I try to do for my
collection and honestly if I picked up
any of these palettes on this list I
don't think that I would be overall
satisfied with them when it came down to
like a year later so and now does
everything guys thank you so so much for
watching I appreciate it and I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
