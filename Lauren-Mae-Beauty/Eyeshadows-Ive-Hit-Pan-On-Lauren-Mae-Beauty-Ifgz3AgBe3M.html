Lauren this is going to be me showing
you all of the eyeshadows I've hit pan
on I did a video a while back about
having a thousand eyeshadows and I will
leave a link down below but it was just
me kind of realizing like wow this is
crazy this is a lot and then also
realizing that I hadn't really hit pan
on anything I had all these eyeshadows
but none of them really had any use so
when I went into my pan that palette
this year I decided to just hit pan on
as many eyeshadows as possible just to
really feel like I've loved my
collection I'm getting use out of my
collection and I've weeded out a lot of
stuff that I don't want or I don't think
works really well because I've actually
been using it so a lot of you guys have
been asking to like see all of them
together so I thought I would just show
you all of the eyeshadows I've hit pan
on if you watch my updates then you have
seen a lot of these and I was thinking
about just doing the ones I've hit pan
on for the year and my project pan but I
just thought why not do all of them so
these are all the eyeshadows I hit pan
on in my collection I hope you guys
enjoyed let's just get into it cuz it's
kind of a lot I'm gonna start off with
eye shadow palette I'm a pallet girl I
would way rather use eyeshadows that are
in a palette form instead of singles so
we're just gonna start there the first
one here is the Tarte aqua Lily's
palette this was limited edition I have
hit pan on this shade here which I don't
know the name of so I apologize and then
also this shade this is the shade
parasol I use this as a face highlight
and then this brown color I used in my
crease and yeah both of them have pan on
it I'm really happy to get use out of
this palette because I bought this and I
really wanted it and it took me forever
to even like really use it it's nice to
see pan on two of the shadows in here
next this is a Stila palette I'm sorry
about the fingerprints and the glare
this is the mind palette yes and I have
hit pan on the shade reason this is just
a matte cream color I use this all over
the lid to set my primer those types of
shades are probably the easiest to hit
pan on for me because I used so much of
it and I use it every single day no
matter what I'm wearing on my eyes so I
feel like there are quite a few of those
shades throughout my collection that if
it pan on this is the lorac mega Pro and
this is the first one I did hit pan on
the shadow in this
this is espresso and you can see the pan
there I have this in my kit so I don't
necessarily use this on myself anymore I
just like to have a nice range of mattes
and shimmers in my kit and I can use
these all over the face so we'll just
stick with lorac pellets because I just
I really like lorac I know a lot of
people are not into lorac but I
personally am so I'm really wanting to
get the lorac pro 3 I probably will get
it I don't know when but I probably will
get that just to have it in my
collection and I just love their
formulation of Shadows anyway this is
the lorac pro one if you can see I've
hit pan on the shade white I fit pan on
the shade cream and I've also hit pan a
lot of pan on the shade nude and I
really like this palette I think this is
just like a really good one if you have
barely any shadows you can do so much
with this palette and I know a lot of
you guys panned this last year so I
don't know if you guys feel the same way
anymore after you know using everything
up in one of these palettes but I just I
really love this palette and I've hit
pan on three shades in here
this is lorac pro 2 I have hit pan on
two shades I'm a little bit of a spoiler
in this video this is the shade buff and
then this it's really tiny I don't even
know if you can see it but barely I hit
pan on this one today this is the color
snow I have it on my inner corners I
really like that shade to brighten at
the inner corner like pretty stark I'm
pretty fair so I really need something
quite bright to really give a really
nice pop and snow has been doing it for
me lately I really love this palette I
know the two does not get as much love
and it's considered really cool but
honestly like a lot of these are warmer
I know I don't really think of this as
like a cool palette I think of it as
having like a couple pops but I feel
like some of these are pretty I don't to
me warm anyway I really like this
palette too and no that's not it I also
have the lorac pro 2 this one came out
for holiday of 2015 and I hit pan on
burlap that one you can just see
straight up so I hit pan on burlap last
year in a project pan I was trying to
pan this and I really liked that shade I
really like warm type of crease looks I
have a couple of Anasazi palettes and
I've hit pan on this is the Miah Miah
palette and I have hit pan on the shade
caramel you can see it there just a
barely a little bit I feel like once you
hit pan on something you really can get
a good
if you like it if you don't like it if
you want to get rid of it if you want to
keep it and to me I don't need to use it
the entire shadow to feel like I got my
money's worth if I eat hit pan on like
half of the shades in this palette that
to me would be worth the money because
of how many uses that is and that's more
what I'm trying to do I'm just trying to
just love and use my collection and this
is like an oldie but a goodie this is
the lavish palette I have a pan on two
of the shades in here this is orange
soda one of my all-time favorite shades
ever I barely have anything left I
really need to repress it and then this
is the shade cream I do like this
palette I think it was a really good buy
for me I really like the color Santa
this is a good one and I really want
Modern Renaissance like I'm for sure
we're gonna get that one those are like
the two palettes that I'm just like once
I get any amount of money they're my and
I don't know I really really want this
once I don't need them but I do really
really want them continuing on palettes
I have three wet and wild
eight pan shadows this one it's kind of
a cheat one but I counted this one is
the definer shade in here it's like that
blue brown pigment that looks like
duochrome II I did hit pan on that
because it broke and it cracked and it
just broke and cracked even more so
that's a cheat one but I do technically
count it next this is a limited edition
one this is walking the red carpet and I
have hit pan on this shade quite a bit
of pan like gosh and it's just like a
creamy matte like pinky shade I use that
all over the lid like I said to set my
primers and this is another 8 pan
palette this is the palette in drinking
a glass of shine I've hit a lot of pan
in this black shade I used this to tint
some gel for a hair thing I was doing I
used like gel and glitter to like dye my
roots for look I was doing anyway I did
hit pan on that because of using it that
way I think we technically only have one
little tiny palette or quad left this is
the Maybelline eye studio quad in
virtually violet and I did hit pan on
this shake here when my hair was purple
if you want to look back at my videos at
the beginning of the year my hair is
purple and I used this in my brows it
looked really nice I really liked it and
that's how I hit pan on that we are now
onto single shadows and we're almost
done it's not too long hopefully it
won't be too long in the video these are
two single shadows that
hit pan on so far this year they are
both by the brand s mhm and this one
here is in the color squeak it's just a
nice light shimmery color I use this as
an all-over like a face highlight and
then this is the color squeak and this
is a matte cream shade I'm actually
trying to pan it entirely in my project
pan roulette that's why this has even
more wear on it and it's gonna just
continue to get bigger until it's gone
because I'm trying to completely pan
that one I have two Bastilla countless
color pigments I'm really glad I hit pan
on these honestly because I bought these
because they looked so cool but they're
just strange I mean they just look cool
they're not that great my light just
turned off let me fix that I know how
this light looks compared to the other
light but at least it's better than
darkness right
anyway I hit pan on this one here this
is the color center stage and I really
focused in this corner here to use up
that pink and purple again when my hair
was more pink and purple I use this in
my eyebrows it worked really well I also
liked that color in the crease too this
is the color indie and I also hit pan on
this one there it is you can see it
glittering right there
I use this in basically the exact same
way if I had to keep one I'd probably
keep this one just cuz it doesn't have
the blue in it I don't know why I like
want to get rid of them so much I
probably won't they are really nice I
just I don't know once you pair on
something you just feel like
accomplished this one here is a star
looks single when I say I'm sorry the
Lighting's kind of watching it out but I
have hit quite a bit of pan on this I
use this as a fates highlight again also
on the lid I just really like this shade
this is one I definitely will keep
around and use all the way up I think I
only have two more shadows left this is
an oldie this is from covergirl this is
the color tapestry taupe and I have hit
pan on that it's a little bit difficult
to see you again with the light but
right in there there's the pan this I've
had pan on for forever this was before I
made videos I hit pan on this and this
was like all the rage I remember
everyone talked about this shade it is a
nice taupe shade like I'm not usually a
taupe girl I like warmer colors but this
is a really nice just easy everyday look
if you're just wanting something that's
effortless you don't think about glass
this is a color pop shadow this is in
the
color lovely and it's not that hard to
hit pan on color pop shadows because it
is a moosie formula I can kind of move
it around this is like true pan though I
have used it that much I'm not really a
huge fan of these shadows not because
they don't look great or cuz they're not
pigmented I just don't use them enough
and this one's quite glittery it's very
glittery so but I did hit pan on that
those are all the eyeshadows I've hit
pan on quite a few and I only hope to
hopefully like double it by the end of
the year if you have a palette that you
really like I definitely suggest just
working on a color for like a month
seeing if you can hit pan it feels so
good and it just makes you feel a little
better about spending the money that you
do on makeup if you're actually using it
obviously you do you you spend your
money how you want but I know for me it
feels really good so anyway that's
everything I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
