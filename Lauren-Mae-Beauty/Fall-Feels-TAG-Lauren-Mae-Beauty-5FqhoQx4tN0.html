Lauren thank you so much for watching
today is going to be my fall feels tag
I'm technically creating this tag and
it's not that original in the sense that
the questions aren't crazy original I'm
sure these are part of other tags but I
basically just wanted to answer a bunch
of questions about fall and talked about
fall and I felt like the only
appropriate way to do that with like a
good title was creating my own tag so
this is the fall feels tag if you want
to do this you totally can
I'm not gonna tag anyone specifically
down below because I don't know if
anyone will even want to do this but if
you do definitely let me know so I can
go check it out warning off the bat
we're gonna be here a while so I suggest
putting this onto the background while
you're doing something or I don't even
know just know it's gonna be a long long
one I have a lot of questions I think I
have like nine different like categories
and then in those categories there is a
lot to talk about so let's start off
with Beauty I'm not someone who follows
trends necessarily when it comes to
beauty I just do whatever I want
whenever I want
but for fall I do really like something
I like to call like simple and severe so
the look overall is simple but there are
some aspects that are more severe so
today I tried to like kind of
demonstrate that I have the really
severe lip but then my eye is very
simple I do have a bit more of a glow
going on I don't know if you can see
that on camera also my eyebrows maybe
are a little bit more severe but there's
no thick liner there's something still
fresh about the look I really like that
kind of witchy vibe so that's kind of
what I went with and that's like my
favorite fall look and that's what I
will be recreating so I'm going to be
mentioning some of the products that I'm
going to be using to create a more
simple and severe look I am by no means
saying you should get these exact
products most of what I'm talking about
when it comes to beauty it's just gonna
be like giving you color inspiration or
more like ideas of what you could do
with products you already have
especially when it comes to the lip
products but we'll get there in a second
so for highlighting I have a couple
different options I really like a more
stark white bright highlight when it
comes to fall and even into winter I am
more fair and I kind of like to get away
from the more glowy tan golden look and
do something a little bit more stark and
severe on my skin I love this palette
you guys have already heard me talk
about it this is the kiss professional
hey love strobing palette in the shade
light every single one of these works on
my skintone but specifically this white
shade is going to be absolutely
beautiful for fall and winter I'm so
excited to wear this I have it on my
cheekbones today I have it down my nose
on my Cupid's bow it's absolutely
gorgeous
and I think this palette in general is
just such a great Buy especially if you
have a fair or light skin tone and then
the other highlighters that I have here
are both just like the same thing but I
thought I would show both I think that
holographic highlighters are a really
fun way to like spice up your look if
you have a dark lip you can like layer
them over that I just really like them
so this one is the moon child palette
you guys have all seen this lots of
great options in here and then I also
have the Kat ones The Alchemist palette
which also is beautiful there are less
shades but you do get a mirror and these
ones don't have any glitter in them so I
suggest both I do like both I think I
like the Kat Von D when just slightly
more at the moment but I think they're
both great palettes I want to talk about
2i products before I get into the lips
again going with that like harsh stark
white highlight I'm going to be trying
to get more use out of this shade from
urban decay
I just dropped this palette so I hope
that everything's okay this is the shade
cosmic it's one of their moon dust
shadows and I have this on my inner
corner today it's a super white glittery
shadow I think this just helps keep the
look subtle but still gives it a pop of
something interesting you could put this
on the lid I probably will be wearing it
on the inner corner I just think it's
really beautiful that way but I am
definitely going to be getting more use
out of this and suggest like any really
bright white shimmery shades I think
they just look so cool and then to go
along with that I just wanted to mention
glitter liner and
I really like the Urban Decay ones and I
also think Knicks have some that are
really good this one happens to be from
hard candy
we have blowers I'm gonna finish this
and then I'll stop while they go so
anyway this one happens to be from heart
candy again I'm wearing it today I don't
necessarily not suggest this and I don't
suggest it in the same at the same time
this can be really pretty I just
definitely suggest putting a light layer
of this on because if you gloop it up
too much it gets kind of crackly
especially if you have a lot of powder
around it so I do like it it's
affordable and wearing it today and I'm
going to continue to wear it but it's
not a foolproof formula for sure so if
you wanted something I would maybe check
out the next ones or check out the Urban
Decay even though they're a bit more
expensive okay so the mowers are gone
are gonna move on to lip products I have
quite a few lip products so again this
is just going off of color inspiration
I'm basically showing you every dark lip
I have because that's what I go to to
fall I feel like obviously dark lips are
what's going to be really trendy for
fall so I'm gonna start off with what
I'm wearing today this is from a kiss
New York professional and this is the
color wicked force it is like a dark
green it's really pretty it's a liquid
lipstick which is not my normal formula
but I feel like for fall I am more
inclined to have like matte lips and
then like more dewy skin so I'm excited
to get more use out of this I really
like it with a look today it's something
that I feel like is still very neutral I
don't think a lot of people would be
wearing a really green lip but this
one's dark enough that it just gives you
that subtle hint of green without it
being like you're a snake or something
so I really like this one - more like
with lipsticks that I have this next one
is from la splash and this is the color
Katrina this is from like a dia
stainless mortos collection and this is
actually duo chrome so it kind of looks
like those beetles or like the blue
brown pigment or that color in the wet
and wild comfort zone palette it has
that look to it this is hardcore when it
comes to staying power it's going to be
so hard for this to come off of my hand
this one is a really cool one and I do
want to wear it more especially I think
into October when it's getting a little
spoon
and the last darker colored liquid
lipstick that I have here is from M
cosmetics I actually did a whole first
impressions and review of the M cosmetic
lip cloud paints I don't know what these
are called they are like a weird name
this is the color Spanish earth and I do
like this color I definitely suggest
wearing a lip liner underneath it so
that way it doesn't turn out patchy but
this is super lightweight on the lips it
reminds me of the NYX soft matte lip
creams it's a very similar texture and
consistency over a lip liner it does
work out really nice and I do still like
it so I will be wearing it if you really
want like good formulas because again I
don't wear a ton of lip product so I
feel like I'm just showing you colors
and not necessarily the best formulas go
to Elle's channel she does like the
lipstick really she's like obsessive lip
product so she will give you a better
idea of some great lip products and she
just did a video on her top 5 falling
products so that will help you I have
two different lip liners here that I'm
gonna be using with these products one
is from colour-pop in the color dukes
look at that do you see how it's coming
out that's the one thing I do not like
about these lip liners they just dry up
so fast and I just bought these this one
is a really pretty color though and I
will be using it to line my lips the
other one I have here is from bite
Beauty I got this in an influencer Vox
box this is the color 0:44 it's like so
similar to the Dux color this is a drier
formula it reminds me of the Mac lip
pencils this is not my favorite lip
liner though it just doesn't build up
nicely and it can get kind of patchy so
I don't necessarily suggest it but it's
what I have in my collection and what I
will be using and the last like dark lip
color here is also from bite Beauty this
is the color whisky and it went with
that lip liner so that's why I have it
this is really pretty and if I want
something that's gonna be a little bit
more comfortable than a dry liquid
lipstick I will be reaching for this
color I still have a couple lip products
even though they're not dark this one is
a lip gloss it's called the molten lip
color from cabinet quant and it's in
Cyprus guy this is an iridescent lip
color and what I really want to do with
this is put it over some of these other
colors that I have so that's it's
watched over
that Katrina color it's like a fun way
to pump it up and like do something
different I think this will give like
definitely kind of like a punk look or
kind of what G vibe again so I do want
to get some use out of that over these
darker lip colors and then for all the
times when I'm not gonna be wearing dark
lips this is what I'm going to be going
to this is my absolutely number one
favorite lip product ever in the whole
world
I wear this any time of year any time of
day I love it this is from buxom and
it's the color dolly it's their full-on
lipstick it's the perfect color for me
it's just absolutely beautiful
if I ever don't know what to wear this
is what I wear because I know it'll look
good I know I'm gonna feel confident and
feel beautiful I love the formula I love
that it's in one of these like skinny
tubes these are my favorite type of lip
products so it's an Oliver one for me
and last I promise we're almost done
this is the fresh sugar rosy lip balm
I love the fresh lip balms they're some
of my favorite formulas this one is so
nice because it's going to give your
lips a little bit of color but nothing
too much and that's what I love about it
it's going to be moisturizing and kind
of this nice like bitten look it's not
that bitten because it's not that dark
but it just looks nice and simple and
it's moisturizing so I really love that
and I will be getting use out of that as
well I'm gonna swatch this too because I
don't think I'm gonna do inserts because
I'm lazy but this is the color I'm
wearing right now that's it there it
goes on really even too I know that
swatch doesn't look like it but I did
two layers to get the deepness but you
could still do one layer of this see I
told you look at that that's so hard to
get off the next time we're gonna talk
about our fall nail polishes again I'm
not necessarily suggesting these
specific nail polishes but more think of
the textures and the colors that is more
the inspiration so once again it's kind
of a lot of stuff so sorry guys first I
want to talk about some metallic
polishes that I want to get some use out
of this is the color fairy lights from
butter LONDON
it's a really pretty warm purple and
metallic and I'm gonna wear Pink's I
wear pink all the time so
I probably will still be wearing Pink's
throughout the year but this is a nice
fun way to do like a bright fun color
but still has a fall twist to it this
next color from Essie is very similar it
has a metallic sheen but this is a
cooler toned lavender and this is in the
color nothing else metals and then last
for metallic nail polishes this is or
Leigh's rage a very classic polish I
actually tested this out earlier in the
year in my polish pics video that's kind
of like my nail polish project pan that
I have going on throughout the year I
think this is such a beautiful polish
there's a reason everyone loves it so I
cannot wait to get some good use out of
it this fall and then the next five
polishes that I have are all creams I
feel like if I had to pick one finish
for the rest of eternity as much as I
love glitter and like holographic I
would pick cream I just feel like it's
so classic it just looks so good on the
nails always I have quite a few
different colors that I'm going to be
gravitating to the first one is a
classic from OPI this is Linkin Park
after dark this is a very very dark
purple it looks black basically on my
nail so it it just looks cool I mean I'm
a fan of dark nail polish when I do
paint my nails there's something about
it that makes me feel just like edgy and
cool so this next one from Essie is also
a classic this is Bahama Mama and what I
love about this is it actually stays the
color in the bottle on your nail so
you're not going to get something too
dark and too black you're actually going
to get this really pretty burgundy berry
color the next one is also from Essie
this is the color chinchilla this is a
nice medium toned grey so it's not too
light it's not too dark I feel like it
gives fall without being too campy and I
do really like this color again I
already have worn this for the year my
last Essie polish to talk about this one
is the gogo geisha color it was from the
fall line last fall this is just the
most beautiful pink nude I love it so so
much it looks really really good with
like a holographic glitter on top of it
oh so pretty the formula on this is also
amazing and so I do suggest this one
it's just so good
I will leave head-to-toe beauty link
down below that's a place you can go and
get like polishes that are from like
last year's collections and whatnot
they do like Essie Color Club China
blade
you can definitely get the older
collections on there and for a really
good price anyway the formula on this is
really nice it's super opaque in one
coat which I feel like for essays like
lighter nudes is sometimes they can be
hit or miss so I love this everything
about this is absolutely beautiful and
last this is like a fun pistachio this
is butter London's of bossy boots so
pretty it's like a fun twist on fall I
feel like it's still gonna be bright and
colorful but it has this like grey tinge
to it it definitely is more muted and I
think would look great for fall oh my
gosh we made it through the nail
polishes guys we're moving on to fall
sentence I have a bunch of different
type of products that smell good to talk
about so the first one is a perfume this
is Jessica Simpson's fancy love now
nothing about this is necessarily
fall-like but it just has so many scent
memories tied to it for fall for me when
I smell this it just reminds me of
putting this on my scarves and putting
this on my sweater so I do want to bust
this out again and continue making those
memories I also want to try to get this
used up this year we'll see this is not
my favorite scent at all but for me this
is definitely just like it means fall is
here the seasons are changing it's
getting colder out or at least hopefully
getting colder out and yeah I'm gonna
use it I'm gonna use it this year
you really can't talk about false ends
without talking about Bath and Body
Works fall candles like I don't think
it's possible so I have a bunch of
different sense that I like from them
the first one here is sweater weather
this one I've already started burning
for the year it smells really really
good
some of the notes on here are juniper
berry fresh sage and eucalyptus I love
to describe this as a men's cologne but
like fall edition it definitely is more
of a unisex or manly scent it falls in
line with mahogany teak wood and other
scents like that from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
so I do really like this especially if
you like something clean and nothing too
sweet my all-time favorite Bath and Body
Works candle is the scent autumn it
smells so great it's very fresh and
clean but it has that apple scent to it
without any of the like cinnamon or
bakery scents thrown in it's just so
good absolutely favorite I've burned
that the last like four years I want to
say so I need to go
just like one of them just to have this
year just to burn it and smell it and
enjoy it while the seasons changing I
just love it the other mouth of body or
candle that I wanted to mention that I
have is the caramel pumpkin swirl this
is not normally my scent profile I am
NOT a bakery sweet type of person but
undeniably this smells like fall it's
crazy like I have barely burned this
because it you just don't need to burn
that much of it it smells up my house in
like two seconds even if I just have
just open without burning it it's going
to smell up my house so I like having
this on those days I really want a cozy
warm scent maybe it is a little bit
colder or it's raining this just is so
comforting for a short period of time
and if you like bakery sense I do
suggest this one it's really nice I also
really like the scent cider Lane from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it has such an
interesting smell it smells very sweet
at first like caramel but then it has
the tart apple it just smells really
good that one is my favorite more
sweet-smelling fall scent from them and
last four candles this one is not from
Bath and Body Works
it's from Chesapeake Bay candles I got
this at Target on Black Friday last year
this is the scent autumn leaves it
smells so good but this does not smell
like autumn to me this smells like Bath
and Body Works old candle called mango
beechwood which was one of my favorite
scents they only brought it out one year
which was so sad but this smells almost
exactly like it so that's why I love it
but since it's a fall candle and that's
when you're going to be able to get it
if they have it this year I thought I
would mention it so you guys could get
it if you wanted to if I'm in a target
and I see this I will probably pick up
another one because I do love it that
much and the last item that I have
percent is this one from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works it's a hand soap into scent
marshmallow pumpkin latte again not
normal for me but this smells so good
this is like my all-time favorite I
don't want this in a lotion or a body
scrub or even a candle the hand soap is
where it's at it's the only place I want
it smells so good when you wash your
hands with this you walk away with just
such a nice sweet smell lingering on
your hands I've gotten compliments from
like guests who have come over and used
our hand soap when I had this out I have
this one and one more and if I stop in a
bath and Bodyworks and they have the
scent this year I will definitely pick
up another one because I
but that much it's so good I don't want
to be without it that's how much I love
this and I actually go through them
because I think I had at one point like
six of these I love it that much even
after using that many of them next we're
going to be getting into some other
territory so we're gonna be talking
about movies we're talking about music
we're gonna talk about memories we're
gonna talk about traditions so hopefully
you guys are down to hear some of that I
think it'll be fun I'm not just beauty
I'm like a multi-faceted person y'all so
let's talk about movies first I am a
movie person Sam isn't even person we
are movie people Sam wants to act like
we love it that's one of our favorite
things to do is to go to movies we
actually have a movie review channel we
haven't posted in a really long time but
I'll you know it linked in just in case
we love movies just that was kind of how
I wanted to disclaim that of course you
have your fall like Halloween II movies
you can pick hocus pocus which is a
great one if I have to pick something
like that I'd pick the craft you know
guardians of the watchtowers of the West
here eyes like I'm more into that it's
like a chick flick but sassy and witchy
so that's what I suggest if you want to
go something super actually like
Halloween
I'm not into horror but I am into more
dark stories so I have assumed DVDs here
yes I know I still have DVDs I thought I
would just share some of these with you
guys and have a few other ones too but
these movies are a little bit darker
they would be great to watch like on the
fall night with like a coffee or a tea
or I don't know some fall goodies and
you're watching it and it's cold and
it's kind of like a mystery again
nothing to horror but more suspenseful
or just kind of weird so the first one
here is American Psycho with Christian
Bale this is a great movie I highly
suggested it's kind of like a
psychological thriller yeah it's a great
one the next movie that I recommend is
Donnie Darko this has Jake Gyllenhaal in
it and again it's like a psychological
thriller um it just gives me fall vibes
for sure I have two movies by gamma del
Toro that I think would be great the
first one is Pan's Labyrinth this is
just one of my all-time favorite movies
ever it's amazing this is
subtitle that's in Spanish so keep that
in mind but it's an absolutely beautiful
story if you haven't seen this like even
if it's not fall just watch it it's so
great again one of my top movies ever
the other movie that I suggest is
crimson peak which is definitely more of
a fall or Halloween type movie it has a
little bit more of like the spooky
aspect to it
highly suggest that one next is notes on
a scandal this has Cate Blanchett has
Judi Dench this is a very like dark
suspenseful movie it kind of deals with
some like stalking aspects there's like
a scandal notes on a scandal this one is
an oldie but a goodie this is murder by
numbers with Sandra Bullock it also has
Ryan Gosling in it has Michael Pitt in
it this one's really good
I don't know this just reminds me a fall
just like a classic to me and the last
one for DVDs this is just like a funny
one Shaun of the Dead great movie
hilarious love it I do have one other
movie to suggest though I really think
that girl the Dragon Tattoo is a great
one I really like those like murder
mysteries and that one is a really great
story
I suggest the American one that's the
only one I've seen I haven't seen the
Swedish one I have read the books as
well so that would be a great read if
you wanted to they're really good I read
them on audiobook alright next we have
Stahl music I actually made a whole fall
feels playlist so you guys can check
that out I'll leave it linked everything
will be linked down below anything that
I can think of to link it's always down
below just so you guys know anyway I
thought it would talk about some artists
that I really am like gonna be listening
to in fall that I'm excited to be
listening to my normal thing is like I
am obsessed with Drake I'm like his
number one fan I know all the CDs except
for the one with him in future because
I'm not into that but I love Drake so
much like Drake Lil Wayne Young Money
yeah that's kind of like my normal so
yeah I also love post Malone but for
fall like I wanted to go a little more
acoustic I'm also going those songs that
more have like memories tied to them
that are fall related so so I'm gonna
check out my playlist and let you guys
know what artists are on there the first
one I want to talk about is Mumford and
Sons I
love their first album with little lion
man on it I got that in fall i remember
Sam took me to borders which isn't even
a thing anymore and we bought that CD
and I just loved it I loved that whole
album I think the whole album is a great
one to listen to and fall but I just
picked some songs to go on my playlist
Taylor Swift is also a big fall music
listen for me because she usually
releases her CDs in the full time so the
album read as well as 1989 are on this
not all of them I picked and shoes
picked and chose some of the ones that I
think are the best read it just reminds
me of working at justice and it's fall
time we're going into holiday we're
prepping for like Black Friday doing
floor sets late at night and then 1989
is actually the CD that we listened to
while we drove up the coast for our
honeymoon so we got married in November
so that is just like has a lot of fall
memories tied to it and like seasons
changing Lana Del Rey is also on this
playlist she's just so moody her music
is so great I love her I put some of her
songs on here I love ride I love
American I love uh just so many of them
Florence and the Machine dog days are
over that reminds me of starting college
a fall semester my first fall semester I
listen to it so much I love that song so
much and I had it unlike a YouTube
playlist so that song along with other
songs from Florence the Machine are on
here as well they just have a very like
moody vibe to them I have some songs
from Lourdes on here I really like the
newer one called
liability that one's so good it's like a
piano and then the last artist on here
I'm probably the one I suggest the most
is iron in wine Sam has listened to iron
wine since like I've known him he
absolutely loves his music so I know so
many songs they don't even realize I
know because he's listened to them so
many times and it's just really great
music it's kind of acoustic his voice is
amazing I actually bought Sam tickets
for his birthday last year and we went
up to Santa Barbara in September of last
year to watch him perform acoustic it
was like a super small audience I'm so
awesome so
everyone that's who I suggest I will
leave some songs down below of his
specifically just give me an idea like
just imagine you're on your balcony
we don't have about me but if he did or
if you're I don't know just cleaning the
house doing stuff hanging out just such
a soothing music I love it and not all
of them are like sad some are like nicer
and I have this so many memories tied to
these songs they just immediately remind
me of Sam 2 which is like anyway that's
enough of that I'll try not to sing or
play any more music I'm sorry next let's
talk about fall foods I don't have a ton
of foods that I eat during fall I'm not
a pumpkin spice latte type of girl I
actually don't even like hot drinks I
like everything
iced so I don't really have anything
drink wise I go to for fall but I love
my mom's pumpkin bread she makes
homemade pumpkin bread that is so
delicious it's the best it's better than
any bumpkin bread you've ever eaten and
I cannot wait to have some of that when
we go back home whenever we do hopefully
we'll go back in October at some point
next let's talk about fall traditions me
and Sam have two that we basically try
to do every single year so the first one
is Disneyland's Halloween kind of
celebration that they do once again
we're not really into horror so we love
that it's so much fun we love Disneyland
I highly suggest doing one of the
Disneyland Halloween games if you're in
the area or if you were thinking about
it for the price you get a lot you don't
get to get into the park the entire day
but you do get to go in three hours
earlier than the event actually starts
so you can usually get in at like four
and then you're there till midnight they
do trick-or-treating so you can go and
get a ton of candy you can go back on my
Instagram and see how much candy me and
say I brought home it's insane so you
definitely can get your money's worth in
like chocolate alone but if you're not
into that you can also get on the rides
and there is barely any weight because
there are only so many people allowed in
the park so either way it's such a
win-win
they suggested I'm pretty sure we're
gonna go this year as well and then the
other fall tradition that we have is
corn mazes
again not a huntin one just a regular
one because we're babies but I just have
so many good memories of doing corn
mazes with Sam it's so much fun to like
sneak around and we usually try to like
not like like run away from people like
if we hear people will like sneak around
I don't know we're just weirdos and it's
so much fun to have so many good
memories so I actually have a flock of
when we went to Temecula last year and
went to the forum a so I will leave that
link down below if you want to check it
out I don't know how good it will be or
if you're even interested but it'll be
there corn mazes are so much fun and
they're definitely one of our traditions
we're almost done next our fall memories
so for this I just wanted to talk about
some things that just reminded me of
fall some things that are really
sentimental when it comes to fall and
they all have to do with my relationship
with Sam we started dating
October 13th of 2007 so it's going to be
our ten-year anniversary this October so
October is always just such a good
memory for me because it's our dating
anniversary it was a Friday the 13th
when we started dating and this year
will be the 10 years and it's also
Friday the 13th so our relationship is
just grounded in Halloween and
spookiness that's just like such a good
memory for me and it always gets me
excited we also again got married in
November three years it'll be three
years ago this year and so just going on
our honeymoon and going up the coast we
took a trip up to San Francisco on our
five-year anniversary so that was during
the fall and it was such a good time I
just we drove up there it was just a
good trip we also drove up to Portland
for our honeymoon which was also great
we also stopped by San Francisco where
there I don't know I just I loved the
fall time it's my favorite so many just
amazing memories I love the feeling of
it getting cold I lived in Arizona for
most of my life and then recently moved
to California and there's just something
about it actually starting to get cold
that just is so nice and refreshing to
me and glass is a fall bucket list take
these questions as you will they're
totally up for interpretation but for me
one of my fall bucket list things to do
that I want to do
is travel to Salem Massachusetts like
leading up to Halloween I think that
would be just so beautiful
me and Sam absolutely love to travel
like if there's ever time in my life
where I can just travel or I don't know
travel the United States like I would
love to do a road trip across the United
States and go to all these different
cool places I just think that
Massachusetts during autumn would be so
beautiful I don't get to see any of the
leaves turning red and yellow and orange
I don't get to see any of that I've
never experienced that again Arizona and
California kind of don't have those
types of seasons really so I would love
to experience that just anything on the
East Coast during fall would be
absolutely amazing if you were still
