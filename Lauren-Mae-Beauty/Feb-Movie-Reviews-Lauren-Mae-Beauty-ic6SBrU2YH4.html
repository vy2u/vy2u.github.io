Lauren this is going to be a different
video for my channel I wanted to do a
movie review for the month so me and Sam
watch a lot of movies it's something
that we like to do in our downtime and
being inspired by the booktube community
how they do reviews on their books I
thought it'd be fun to do reviews on the
movies that we watch i also want this
channel to be more well-rounded and i
wanted to show just different sides of
me because there are different sides
other than beauty and i enjoy this so i
want to put it up on my channel i hope
you guys enjoy and these are the movies
that I watched for the month of februari
and I'm just doing like a simple five
star rating a tiny little synopsis and
just a few points on it so hopefully it
goes okay I don't normally do like movie
reviews or something so we'll work on it
as we go and through each month you all
I will leave all the movie titles down
below and I will let you know too if
there are Netflix at least when I
watched them the first movie i have
written down on my list of movies is a
teacher i watched this on netflix this
was about a woman's teacher who has an
affair with a male student and just kind
of follows their relationship until it
gets to the end and kind of how things
go i don't want to give away too much of
it a little bit about me these are the
types of movies i like i like a really
gritty kind of sexy dark not twisted but
like just those types of movies usually
they are like more foreign films and
stuff but this one wasn't this one was
in english i gave a teacher two stars i
thought it was okay the acting was okay
but it just didn't quite satisfy me kind
of left me wondering like okay why was
this made I don't know it was just okay
if you're into those movies specifically
maybe give it a try but it's not
something I would like recommend people
to watch just because it wasn't that
amazing to me it didn't touch me it
didn't make me like think about anything
really outside of it so I gave it two
stars the second movie I watched was in
bloom this was also on netflix and in a
similar vein to a teacher this one
though was a foreign film so it wasn't a
different language it takes place in a
war-torn country i cannot remember the
country so i'm sorry for that but it
follows two girls as they grow up they
are like
13 14 years old and just kind of follows
their life it's really just like a slice
of pie of their life I did enjoy this
movie I gave it like two stars
originally I kind of give it two and a
half now because I do think that it just
has more meaning than a teacher I mean
obviously two things can have different
star ratings or the same star ratings
but have different qualities but I do
think it's more like two and a half
stars it's not that it's bad it's just
definitely not everyone's cup of tea not
something again that I would recommend
to like just be like yeah it was okay
you should watch it it wasn't like that
if you like those types of movies again
you might like it it just left me
thinking a little bit more about one you
know what it's like for people in
different countries and especially me
being a woman as well how they grow up I
just thought that was interesting but it
wasn't like amazing again it didn't make
me think too too much it was just okay
number three confessions of a Brazilian
call girl again kind of in the same
realm this one is based off of a true
story about a call girl who kind of
rises to fame and eventually has her own
site and makes her own money and then
just kind of follows her life I believe
it's based off a book or at least again
her like real life story this is
definitely the most scandalous out of
the movies that I watched definitely sex
in it just warning y'all in case you
don't want to see that I gave this movie
two stars as well I did enjoy it in some
regards because it was a true story
there's something about it being real
and like someone's actual life that
makes it more interesting than if it was
just like some fabricated tale that they
put to a movie so that kind of is like
the thing that gave it two stars instead
of one to me the acting was okay though
again it was a foreign film so it was
subtitled it was just ok but again it is
scandalous number for this was the movie
dope I was so excited for this movie
this movie follows three best friends in
high school and they're really into I
believe like like 90s 80s I think like
90s rap and that type of stuff so that's
like what they're into their style
reflects add the way they look but it's
taking place in
time and they get into some trouble and
then they have to get out of it I was so
excited for this movie and I think that
set me up for failure I gave us three
stars I just felt like the movie was two
movies almost in one it wasn't cohesive
it was like the first part of a movie
then stuff got really crazy and weird
and then it was like this weird ending I
did enjoy it enough to be like Oh were
you interested or oh yeah you should
check it out if you already knew what it
was and maybe thought it was good but it
definitely didn't live up to what I
wanted it to be like I wanted it to be
so good but um it was still ok I don't
like regret watching it I just wished it
was better I think that was the biggest
thing with me dope was on netflix so was
confessions of a brazilian call girl the
a-team is a movie we own this year me
and say we're trying to work through all
of our DVDs we organize them
alphabetically and that is how we are
choosing them that's why we're I have a
lot of a teams and things that start
with a and things that start with
numbers in this list but i love the
a-team I don't know what it is Liam
Neeson Bradley Cooper it's like a movie
based off the show I'm not gonna like
get into it if you don't know if the e
team is you can research that and it's
so good i think that this movie although
it's just kind of like this action
comedy type of movie does exactly what
it's supposed to do i go into it i just
want to have something entertains and it
does that it's funny it's comedic i love
the actors in it I just thought it was
an overall good movie I might have just
some like connection to it for some
reason but I just really liked it I've
seen it twice now and I liked it both
times I want them to come up with a
second one I don't know why they don't
they should the next movie is Amadeus
that is another one that we own and
Amadeus is about basically this guy who
is a composer and he lives in the time
of Amadeus and he's basically jealous of
Amadeus this whole time and he works
really hard on his work I can't remember
his name but he works really hard on all
of his you know Symphony using
compositions and Amadeus is just kind of
this fool who laughs and you know not a
fool in a bad way I don't know he's just
definitely more carefree but then gets
all the glory and reward and is really
good at his work that this main
character wants so anyway definitely
watch it I
love it the makeup in it is amazing i
believe dick smith did the makeup and it
was so so good the aging makeup on the
main character i gave it five stars and
i was really intimidated by this may be
going in it was something i didn't
really want to watch and since we're
just working our way through we kind of
just had to watch it and i loved it i
really enjoyed it and i think it's one
of those ones that kind of even though
it's an older movie i still enjoyed it
today and i think that's something that
says a lot number seven American
Gangster I love this movie as well
American Gangster follows a tale of the
tail follows the tail now follows the
story of a heroin dealer who you know
rises to fame and then the cop who was
trying to get him it's based off a
real-life story Denzel Washington is
amazing he's so hot you just like want
him to be your boyfriend which is kind
of crazy but true if you watch it you
know if you've watched Goodfellas you
also know I really enjoyed the story I
think it's interesting that they can
kind of parallel these two peoples lives
the cop and the criminal and you still
are kind of rooting for the criminal or
at least I was and it was just a really
really good story I think they did a
really good job and I gave it five stars
as well so really good movie I
definitely suggested it has a lot of not
a lot of violence but I mean it's mature
content for sure number 8 21 Jump Street
I'm not going to go into this 21 Jump
Street it's a comedy it has Channing
Tatum it has brie Larson it has jonah
hill it's like an okay movie I gave it
three and a half stars I'm not usually
into those types of comedy movies but
for some reason this one is genuinely
funny to me in a lot of ways not every
way sometimes it's just like really
immature in a way that I don't find
funny and it's more just like awkward
for me but overall I do think it's funny
and i have seen like the second one or
whatever so yeah i did enjoy it and I
give it three and a half stars not much
i'll say about that one it's just like a
comedy that you'd watch when you want to
just like chill out number nine kind of
the exact opposite 2001 a Space Odyssey
this is a Stanley Kubrick film this
follows people that are in space I don't
even know like I'm not even gonna go
there because this movie is like
an onion of layers and I didn't want to
watch this for a really long time there
was never a moved when I was in the mood
to watch it so we finally had to because
we started going alphabetically I love
this movie it's one of the ones that
kind of has to seep into my skin for a
while so I as I'm watching it I might
not like it but as I look back on it
it's something that I really enjoyed and
really just got my mind going I really
just thought about it a lot the music
sometimes was a little much but I also
think it was really well done that's
just something personally with me that
music sometimes almost as a character in
a movie just irritates the crap out of
me like Birdman sometimes it's just too
much for me that's just my own personal
thing I know a lot of people like that
and it's like usually a stylistic choice
like on purpose but I think the music
was still done really well even though I
had to get past my own thing I think
that the biggest thing for me is that
for when this movie was shot it still is
so relevant the shots are so amazing for
what they had when they had it to make a
film like that it's just it blows your
mind when you watch it today because
even today those shots still look
amazing so there was also a really good
make up to for the Apes I just really
did enjoy it especially looking back so
I gave it four and a half stars and I
definitely think that it's a good one I
think everyone should see at some point
the next movie I this is the 10th movie
on the list this was soaked in Bleach
this was a documentary and it's about
Kurt Cobain's death but it's also
looking into the fact that courtney love
might had something to do with it and
presenting information that would make
that seem true along with like the
lawyer really interested i was really
excited for this documentary but i don't
like when documentaries try to put like
actors in the documentary I'd rather
just get the information straight
forward I'm I already like documentaries
I already know that that's what this is
I'm going to be given like
straightforward facts and to me it just
models the facts when you have someone
that I know is acting and not actually
saying it saying the actual words that
are recorded like that's weird right
that is weird I feel like it weakens
your point and I just did not enjoy that
about this documentary
I ended up giving it two and a half
stars because I do like the content I
just don't think it was executed well
but I do think that the information
presented was persuasive I just wish it
was done differently to be even more
persuasive number eleven Happy Valley
this was another documentary and this
was following the case I don't know a
ton because Sam was the one that wanted
to watch this I didn't really know much
about it was about the coach at Penn
State I think it's penn state who had
sexually molested children and that's
what i thought it was going to be about
which it was about that but it was
mostly about the other coach who didn't
sexually harass anyone or molest anyone
but kind of knew about the situation and
how the town reacted to that and I just
felt more about him than the actual like
whole situation as a whole and I wasn't
expecting that so I kind of wish it was
more about the actual like the meat of
the situation although that isn't
something I'm actually interested in
watching necessarily because it's just
such a horrible horrible topic and I
don't know anyway that's just something
that was different than I thought going
into it and also they were kind of it
was definitely one side of documentary I
felt like they were definitely trying to
paint him in like a really good light
and so to me that just put me on edge
knowing that I felt like that's what
they were trying to do so everything
they were saying I was like kind of like
skeptical about instead of just pull
heartedly believing so that's just
something for me number 12 the 12th
movie I watched was a movie called pure
this is another foreign film again kind
of in the rut of the movies that I
talked about at the beginning of the
video it was about a girl who kind of
has a sad life it's just kind of like a
boring existence and she somehow gets
this job at an opera theatre no no an
opera theatre like an orchestra house
that's more what I'm talking about here
and so she gets the job they're kind of
out of false pretenses but you know
nothing is necessarily wrong with that
then she starts having an affair with
one of the conductors and just kind of
follows that story kind of gets crazy at
the end I did kind of enjoy this movie I
gave it three stars as opposed to the
two stars of the other one I just think
it was a more solid movie it had
something unexpected I just enjoyed it
more I felt like it was more quality and
it
dell dell with the topic that i wanted
to deal with so i enjoyed it it was on
netflix if you want to check it out it
was pretty good it was subtitled though
again because it was foreign and number
13 this was adult world this was a
second time I'd watched it this is John
Cusack as Emma Roberts it has Evan
Peters I think the casting was really
done really well I love Emma Roberts I
love Evan Peters so I'm already like in
love with the movie already but it's
just a good one I mean it's independent
but it's still really funny but it's not
like funny like you know 21 Jump Street
to me it's like more understated and I
think if you were someone in college you
would get it better it's about a girl
who gets down with college she wants to
be a writer she's really dramatic and
she finally gets to meet someone who's a
really famous writer that she like loves
and he's kind of a washed-out writer now
and so she's like in love with him and
just thinks the world of him but he's
kind of a jerk she also gets a job at a
porn store because she has to pay for
bills and of course that is like the
death of her because she's going to be a
writer and yeah it just follows that
story I think it's really funny and I
definitely enjoyed it it's not like the
best movie ever but it's something I did
enjoy the second time around and I know
I would want to watch it again I gave it
three and a half stars no three and
three fourths stars my bad for what it
is i think it was done really well and i
enjoyed it so i hope you guys enjoyed
and i can't wait to do more of these
every single month with the movies that
I watched maybe sometimes I can have Sam
be in the video I don't know maybe this
is actually the second time I've filmed
it because the first time I really
didn't give synopsises so the whole time
just like it was good it was good it was
good and i thought i'd give you a little
bit more to go off of in case you wanted
to look into watching any of these
movies i hope you guys enjoyed and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
