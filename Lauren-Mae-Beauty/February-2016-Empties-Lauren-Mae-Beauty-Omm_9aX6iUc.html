Lauren thanks for holding on with me and
watching all these videos this is going
to be my februari empties video I'm
trying to get all these like
time-sensitive videos out of the way so
that way we can move on to other content
throughout the month I'm really hoping
to upload a lot this month too but
anyway let's get into what I used up I'm
super happy because I used up a lot of
makeup outside of my projects you guys
know that I don't show like double cilic
if I have stuff going on in other
projects I don't show you those empties
in my monthly empties so this is all
brand new stuff you haven't seen so i'll
start off with makeup first that way if
you guys don't want to watch the rest or
if that's what you're most interested in
you can see that first let's get into it
i have 2 concealers that are used up
this month this first one is by by Terry
this is the terribly dense illus
concealer and this is in the shade one
fresh fair it is their lightest shade I
did pull out the stopper on that so
there's no stopper in there it's really
hard to get product out and this
honestly wasn't my favorite concealer I
thought it was okay i felt like it
oxidized on my skin but immediately like
I put it on it look light and then
throughout like me blending it out with
my Beauty Blender it would kind of
darken up and I didn't like that so I
wouldn't purchase this this is crazy
expensive i got it from work so you know
i didn't have to pay for it but i
personally wouldn't buy it i think the
only people or people who really benefit
from this concealer would be people who
are really looking for skincare makeup
as well as people who have more mature
skin they might really like this product
but i personally it wasn't my favorite I
wouldn't purchase it for myself the
other consumer used up was enabling
better skin concealer this is in the
shade light if they had a shade fair I
might consider purchasing it because I
do think this has good coverage but
honestly this was just a little too dark
and it was quite yellow I do have like a
yellow undertone and I also like to keep
my skin tone yellow I feel like I could
go pink if I wanted but I just I like
the look of a yellow undertone
personally for myself and so I play that
part of my skin up anyway but this was
just a little too yellow and too dark so
I just personally wouldn't get this
shade again but I did think it was
I didn't see anything different with
like making my skin better but my skin
goes off and on on being like broken out
and totally and completely fine so I
might not be the best judge for that
anyway I did take out the stopper on
this one as well so I really tried to
get every last bit and that is the
reason I had to go and buy 2 concealers
this month is because I was totally out
of concealer I've used all of them up so
now I only have I have two more I think
I only have two right now which is
awesome i feel really good about that
another thing i used up this month was
the bare minerals fairly light
foundation this is a powder foundation I
took out the sifter so I could get every
last bit I do like this product and I
didn't find that it made me itchy which
I was happy about because i've had
problems with that in the past but the
thing i don't like about this is it's
quite Khloe and I think I just would
prefer the mat version of this I have
one more of these to go through this is
one of the items i wanted to use up in
2016 so I'm glad to get one of these out
but I know that if I wanted to
repurchase this again I would go with
the mat one I just think it worked
better for my skin type I finished up a
mini mascara and I'm so sad about it
because I loved it this is urban decay's
perversion mascara this is so good I
cannot wait to purchase this in the
full-size it's so nice i love the wand
on it it gives you volume without clump
eNOS and it also gives me length it's
super black I just I love this mascara I
really really like it it's super good
and I'm definitely going to repurchase
this in the full size as soon as I don't
have a million mascaras I think I only
have two more items so we'll see
hopefully I don't find anything floating
around at the bottom this is small but
this is momentous this is the two-faced
lip injection extreme I did finish this
I pulled out the stopper it's totally
gone I used it all up I'm so proud of
myself this took forever to use up just
because I have no discipline when it
comes to lip products and using them but
I'm glad to finally get this gone it
deserved to be gone it was older it
works though if you want something to
burn your lips and make them plump this
totally does do that it it hurts so yeah
you can kiss your husband or boyfriend
and they will feel the pain
last kind of makeup item this is a
little tube of glitter I would be one of
the only people that can go through
glitter and have it in an empties video
but i did use this in part of the gel
that i use to make my creature and so
it's totally gone and it's an empty for
the year never thought again that i'd go
through glitter but yeah a little bit
that much now let's get into the rest of
this stuff this is the pureology
strength cure shampoo I thought this was
an okay shampoo in the sense that it did
its job but I don't like the packaging
on this again I mentioned this in my
packaging pet peeves it just gets
everywhere you can't get out and a small
enough amount of this like you're
supposed to because you don't need a lot
of this product and that is so annoying
to me especially because this is an
expensive shampoo and that's kind of one
of the selling points to me is that yeah
it's expensive but you're getting like
double the washes out of this but I'm
not if I cannot give myself the proper
amount of product and I'm wasting
product also the smell honest is
disgusting and hideous this is just
smells very powdery and at first I
thought oh it's not bad it's not my
favorite but it's not bad but using it
over and over and over it'll gross never
would i repurchase this i personally
didn't see any like results with it like
helping my hair stay strong or growing
longer so I definitely I would not buy
from this specific line from pureology I
would probably try the volume one next
if I was going to purchase something
from them this is the kenra platinum dry
shampoo I enjoyed this dry shampoo this
smelt very fruity was very fragrant
definitely stayed in my hair I thought
that it did okay for dry shampoo and I
thought that I did okay for texture but
it's kind of just in between I didn't
like hate using this up but i probably
wouldn't go out to repurchase it I'm
just glad that it's gone because I have
a lot of these laying around this is
something I forgot to put in last
month's md's but I'll just include it
now this is the United seven seconds
conditioner it's leavin detangling
conditioner I really enjoyed this
product it smelt nice it felt nice in
the hair I could easily brush through my
hair after this and something that I
really liked is that it didn't get on
the floor some of these products that
you use to detangle you spray it and
then it's
all on your floor you're slipping around
that is so annoying I hate hate hate
that so this is really nice I would
potentially repurchase it but it is
expensive and I do really like my
Moroccan oil so I wouldn't need both of
them because they kind of do similar
things at least for what I need them to
do for my hair so it was really nice if
you were looking for a really good
detangler this is a super good one
there's a lot of hair products in this
but this one is the one I'm crying over
the most this is the bumble and bumble
full form moose it's a thickening
product I love this product and when I
first used it a couple times it was not
my favorite I was very skeptical but the
more used it the more i freaking love
this it made my hair so full this is one
of the reasons i started even wearing my
hair down I cut it and then using this
it was like the perfect mixture of me
just feeling confident about my hair I
have very thin fine hair and I find that
it always just looks limp and just gross
I'm also you know I'm bigger so I want
my hair to be big too and match and not
be like four little scrawny hairs on my
big old body so I really like this I am
definitely going to repurchases i
believe it's like thirty dollars but i
do not care as soon as i finish up my
route pump from big sexy hair i will be
buying this because i love it so much
this is a face wash from ultra luxe this
is the mud lavender wash I was really
excited to try this I don't know why
something about lavender mud made me
really think that this would be great I
did not really enjoy it that much there
was nothing necessarily super wrong with
it but it wasn't super lavender smelling
I wanted it to be thicker it was thin I
wanted to almost be like a mud wash but
it wasn't so I don't know the name just
excited me and it didn't live up to it
for me also this is very similar to the
pureology when you use this it would get
clogged easily so then I'd be squeezing
really hard and then everything would
come out it was still liquidy so I felt
like I could never get the right amount
of product in my hand I always felt like
I was using too much of this I wouldn't
purchase this I got this as gratis when
I was working at the beauty store was
working at so i'm glad i didn't pay for
it but it wasn't it wasn't anything
special I'd seriously look like a face
wipe fiend this
month I don't I think I somehow had a
lot of these going at once so it looks
like I finished so many this month but
really they're all like half packs and
things like that because there's no way
I could really go through this many
wipes I don't know how I did that but
anyway these are from CVS these are just
a travel pack so there's only 12 in
there I was using them in my kit and I
only had a couple left and I you know
it's like you can't really have to in
your kit you need more than that so at
that point I just took him out and
Houston for myself just to use them up
they were ok I wouldn't read well I
would repurchase them for my kid or for
like really basic situations if I needed
something they were quite large and they
were textured which was nice but they
didn't remove makeup amazingly so I
they're not something to rave about
those I would just pick up like I'd pick
up the walgreens brands if i was at
walgreens I pick up the red aid brand if
I was at rite aid that type of situation
the rest of these are from big lots
these are the brand up le appel fpl I
don't know how to say it I got these gin
and glitter here on YouTube told me
about these in the comments and so when
I went to big lots i made sure to pick
some up I did really like these
especially because they're a dollar like
you can't beat that price the only ones
i didn't like where the vitamin c ones
these are for brightening i use these on
my eyes though antigen sting so i know
that they're not going to brighten my
face if they don't sting my eyes i know
that's like the weirdest thing to say
but i really think that's true so I
wouldn't get these ones again I do think
the aloe ones are my favorite I think
those are the ones that she likes the
most too and yeah I definitely would
probably pick up more of these I mean
you just cannot be the price on them and
really what I use them for is just my
face I like to use like a micellar water
on my eyes and then use these just to
get like most of my face makeup off my
face so and then this one is just like a
basic one it doesn't say anything about
a low it just says for all skin types I
went through we had another bottle of
alcohol this is 91 % again I use this in
my makeup palettes my alcohol palettes
just sanitized any of my makeup and just
purposes like that so I easily go
through these another toothpaste I think
we're kind of working on double
toothpaste or two toothpaste at the same
time because we can't go through one of
these in a whole month but I'm glad to
have another one out this was a packet
sample of the skin iceland and these are
the hydro cool firming gel eye gels I
really do like these I think they work
really nice that's why I put the other
one the only one I have left in my March
mini madness video or project because I
just want to finish them up and enjoy
them while they're still good and
because i know i like them i definitely
would look into having these on hand for
times when I just need some something to
really sue then relax my under eye that
just feels puffy or raw I think these
just work really nice if you're looking
for something like that we went through
another hand soap this is the winter
cranberry honestly I didn't really like
this scent um there wasn't anything
necessarily wrong with it I just thought
I'd like it more than I did so I don't
think I would purchase this scent again
which I am very surprised at because
this seems like something i really like
but it was just okay i really want to
focus on having things I just love even
if that means that there's a little more
expensive I just want to enjoy the stuff
I have instead of just having a lot to
have a lot so that's just something I
realized with this but it was okay
nothing I would repurchase only a few
more things there is some makeup at the
bottom I'm so sorry guys two razors I
use these up I just don't okay i know i
said i liked these and i do like them
but I just feel like they get rusty
really fast and they can't last a long
time so I'm kind of trying to figure out
how I can make these last longer or I
don't even know I just it's I just hate
shaving we all know this we all know hav
my legs um yeah I don't know anyway I
think I want to go for something better
that it's like going to last longer like
invest more money so that it lasts
longer instead of going through these so
often i know there's like the Dollar
Shave Club maybe I'll look into that I
don't know I went through another
detangler this month so this was the
only one I had left after the unite one
so now i'm just using my moroccan oil
but this is the big or healthy sexy hair
soy soy try wheat leave in conditioner
I did like this product it smelt nice I
didn't like it as much as the unite one
like if I had to choose between the two
so i probably wouldn't repurchase this
i'm glad i used up the sample I've had
this sample for years so I'm really glad
that because I held on to it that long i
actually did use it up because that
would just be disappointing to just
throw away after moving to California
winces I used a pair of lashes these are
the ardell Glamour's I think they're the
113 s I use these at graduation and did
like the cut up and put them underneath
type of situation I do like these I
think they work really nice and they
look nice and you know glamorous full
but not too full it's just nice I really
like I use a pan cream this is from
l'occitane this is the passionate
Jasmine hand cream and it's the twenty
percent shea butter kind I got this in a
like value set with like three of them I
love this hand cream this is like the
thicker formula out of what they have
and I do really like it it's great for
nighttime and like winter time
definitely not something I would have in
my purse to use throughout the day
because I do think it's a little thick
but something I just feel so soothing
definitely worth the price I really love
it I just I like this hand cream and two
more items they're both makeup this one
here is the bite agave lip mask this was
also in my whoa this was also in my
packaging pet peeves video every one or
a few people not everyone some people
told me in that video that they have
changed packaging which i think is so
amazing and so awesome that they
obviously realize there was an issue
with it and made changes to make it more
practical for their customers who are
buying it because of those comments I
realized wait a minute that means that
this must be kind of old because they
made it sound like it they changes a
long time ago so I smelt it and it does
not smell the same and bite is very more
like it's more natural and so I'm just
going to be getting rid of this I wish
that they sold this in like seriously a
fourth of the container you need so
little of this that unless you're using
it as your only thing you're only
treatment you're only lip balm it would
take a long time to get through this but
I'm just ditching this product and
throwing it away and last
this is my jumbo eye pencil in milk this
is completely shoved into the cap I
cannot get it out anymore I actually use
this and took out all the product in the
middle into a container and used it in
my kit for a white cream base makeup
whether I wanted to use it on the face
or the eyes or whatever I just did not
want to buy then I clown white so I
didn't and I use something I had so I'm
glad that I found a way to make this
work for me I don't necessarily like a
superstar quite to just have on my lid
or something I like it on my waterline
and it's nice to have to if you want
like to put shadow on top of it but this
isn't something that I necessarily need
in my collection I'd rather have like an
eyeliner skinnier pencil than this
larger one that's everything I used up
this month I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I will blue dropping
things and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
