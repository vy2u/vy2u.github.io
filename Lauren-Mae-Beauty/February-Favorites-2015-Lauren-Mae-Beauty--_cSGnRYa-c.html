it's gonna be a february favorites video
if you hear any noises I apologize but
people are doing lawn work outside and
then there's people banging upstairs and
it's just kind of crazy but I still want
to film and I'm gonna film a couple
videos today so hopefully it's not too
distracting or bad and we can just block
it out zone it up another thing to don't
mind this guy he just loves it he likes
hanging out here and I kind of think
it's cute and I kind of think it's weird
and I'm hoping it just looks one cycle
instead of crazy but I'm kind of okay
with crazy too so that is just gonna
hang out there and it's I know it's
there it's intentional kind of let's
just get straight into my video today
I've never done a favorites video so I
am super excited to just show you guys
all the things I've been loving and it's
been kind of a lot so let's just hop
straight into the video the first thing
I want to talk about is this palette
right here I'm super excited because
this came in the mail I got it off of
Etsy and it is a double-sided magnetic
like Z palette but it's custom made so I
picked the material here myself off the
site and it's amazing it's so beautiful
it's such high-quality especially since
she makes them herself and I've just
filled it if you guys want to see I have
just filled that with all my favorite
most used everyday eye shadows so I have
my neutrals up here and then I have more
neutrals and sparkly colors as well as
like colors I just love it I've been
using this since I got it and it's
amazing I'm gonna link it down below if
you guys want to check it out I think
this is $27 which i think is a fair
price especially since it's so cute it's
totally my style and it's just like a Z
palette if you've been wanting something
like this I would definitely go for this
they have tons of different options for
you to choose from and I'm just really
impressed with the quality and I'm
overall everything about this it's just
it's like my palette you know the Z
palette is cute and it's perfect but
this is like that but
and it's so cute and it looks like me
and I just love it so check that out for
sure another makeup product I've been
loving are these blush palettes from
Bobby Brown these came out with a new
spring collection they are so nice I'm
gonna show you the different colors here
this one here is the pink blush palette
this is the berry cheek palette and this
one is my absolute favorite this was the
one I got first as it's a Calypso cheek
palette it has two blushes on the side
and in the middle one there that's
actually a highlighter or a shimmery
blush however you want to use it I guess
they're just beautiful I've never tried
Bobby Brown blushes or anything really
from the brand and I saw these on the
website and they thought they're just
such a good price they're $45 which I
know is a lot but for some reason I
think of Bobby Brown blushes it's like
super expensive they're 27 dollars
apiece for the regular blush which
benefits or leave 26 apiece so I just
think they're great I would definitely
check those out as well they have three
different colors in the lineup and I
bought all of them just cuz they're
beautiful they blend in beautifully the
kind of a powdery but like once you
blend them into the skin they just look
like a part of the skin instead of just
sitting on the top like a powder would I
just love them I'm in love with them I
think they're great I think the colors
that that came out with they're
beautiful and I just highly recommend
them sticking with powder products we're
gonna go into this I bought this Urban
Decay palette off of I believe the
website you know office áfourá and I
filled it with their new moon dust eyes
shadows they came out with new ones for
the spring and they're beautiful my
favorite is this one here solstice it's
a beautiful duochrome Reddy brown teal I
don't even know how to describe it
they're just so beautiful I decided I
got this one first and then I just loved
it so much that I got the other three
and then decided to get the palette
because I might as well keep them in
their own separate beautiful container
they're just wonderful I think that they
did a great job with this they're super
glittery and sparkly and I do like to
put these on first before I do my makeup
just so that way I can clean up fall out
but I mean you expect that there's tons
of glitter and then
and if you use a glitter base then it
should stay on all day I have though the
color cosmic this one here really pretty
just white shimmery color that's the one
I recommend the most if you're just
gonna get one these are I believe $20
apiece $21 a piece they're expensive but
I suggest social system house it's
definitely just the most unique and it's
just beautiful if you love duo chromes
you can make this work so many different
ways ether it's a purple it's kind of
duochrome me they on my website they
consider all of his duochrome
i would not say that but um it has like
really pretty purple pink shimmers in a
deep purple base with gold glitter as
well really pretty really pretty that's
like my catchphrase everything's really
pretty duh I like it this is Scorpio
this is like a black base with gold
glitter in it it's just wonderful I'm
thinking about doing a look with like a
black smokey eye with gold pop in the
middle and I think that I might try to
use that or incorporate that somehow
definitely definitely great shadows if
you're in the market for a glitter bomb
eyeshadow I would check those out
another duo on the eye shadow I have
been loving is this one by Sephora this
is the colorful iridescent shell number
110 shadow from them it's part of a
limited ish in line I would definitely
check them out it's online only this is
just so pretty I have a tutorial that I
use this in I'll link it down below it
just is so beautiful I just have been
really into duochrome
and it's this silver purpley lavender
but then it shines like pink like a warm
pink in the light it's just beautiful I
think I like that one the best out of
all of them I do have all of them but I
love that one the most and just think
it's wearable but you can also make it
look really fun you could just do
whatever you want with it and it's just
something to spruce up your look it's
just great definitely definitely check
that one out last I shadow is this
pigment by Jessie's Girl I got this on
our honeymoon because we didn't have we
don't have Rite Aid's in Arizona so we
were driving up the coast and I thought
oh let's stop in and I got this one and
a couple of
but this is a very very pretty warm
golden e pink color I've been using this
with that stars makeup Haven eyeshadow
that's kind of like a pink color have it
in my Hall and I just blend it out with
just a nice warm or neutral Brown and
it's just so pretty it brings out the
blue in my eyes and I just use this as a
top right use mac fix+ and also a
glitter base glitter glue paste and I
put that on my eye and it's just so
beautiful it's again wearable not mean
to me I think this is wearable it's
wearable but again a fun pop of color
something that just makes your look just
pop and look so beautiful without
looking crazy like you don't know like a
clown and you don't look like you're
trying too hard but you also look like
dang girl you got it going on I guess I
should tell you the color huh this is in
the color Sunset Boulevard how
appropriate I've been loving this and
I'm probably gonna use this quite a few
more times in March cuz I just I loved
it last for a makeup I just have some
lip products I have been loving the
matte lip trend these ones here are one
of my favorite types this is the lorac
Pro matte lip color in I have three
different colors here this one here is
in the color mauve I have the color
violet and I just dropped the other one
and this is in the color pink taupe
these are just so beautiful they glide
on they smell like vanilla and they're
great these are $16 at Ulta that's where
I got them I think I have like two other
colors of these I highly recommend them
they're cheap for like a high-end lip
product I mean they're not cheap but
they are for high-end stuff and they
work beautifully they stay on the lips I
love this violet color it looks
wonderful I have nothing bad to say
about these I love the small like lip
pencil form of product lately so these
are just up my alley and I'm into it I'm
into these and then for a drugstore
option I have these Wet n Wild Fergie
Velvet Matte lip colors these remind me
so much of the NARS ones in the pencil
that you sharpen they are beautiful I
love them this is the
on my lips right now they're just such a
great formula for the drugstore these
are three dollars and change you cannot
beat the price I'm gonna go back I'm
missing like two or three of the shades
and I'm gonna get them because I love
them I want them to come out with more
colors I just think the formula autumn
is wonderful
they're a very like soft silicon e matte
they glide on the lips it feels good it
doesn't feel drying they don't go into
the creases for me of my lips
they're great I'm thinking about doing a
review on them the colors that I have
here are pinkie candy DJ doll and then
plum genu plum janu plum janu I think
this is the one again I'm wearing on my
lips the only bad thing I will say about
these is because the formula is dry and
it's a matte thing I've noticed that two
of mine have come off from the bottom of
the base which is no point out I would
still repurchase these I just love them
still even that even with that I will
still love these hardcore I still do
love these hard work for skincare I have
this simple micellar water cleansing
water I use Bioderma and when we went to
France I bought four huge things of it
because they came in two packs
Sam and me we're on a mission going to
all these different pharmacies trying to
find it and I just recently ran out of
them at the beginning of this year it
was such a sad sad thing to me and I
don't want to pay as much money as they
are if I have to order them like from
Amazon so I saw this in Target and I was
like oh I've heard good things I want to
pick that up this works really well I
want to say almost as well as that so
this is definitely something that I
would repurchase this is I think $6.99
and it doesn't burn my eyes it gets the
makeup on my eyes off just as well as
the Bioderma one I just love it I love
that it doesn't leave an oily residue
even makeup removers that's saying oh
there's no oil residue they still leave
it on my eyes and I hate that feeling
and this doesn't do it so that's why I
prefer this type of product I would
definitely check this out if you are a
fan of Bioderma and see if you like it
because if you can find a cheaper option
definitely worth it so I love this
product this is a log sheet on dry skin
hand
I have like three of these and I was
using a small sample of it that's what
made me love this and I've already used
that up this hand cream just feels so
luxurious on the skin it just is
wonderful I don't use this in like the
daytime I use it just at night but I
really feel like it nourishes your skin
if you're feeling like flakies on the
top of your hand that's kind of where I
get them or new cuticles definitely this
will help you hear them it just feels
great it's a great product I highly
recommend it it is Gracie but not in a
bad way and especially not in a bad way
if you're using it at night before you
go to bed if you're gonna be touching
stuff I personally wouldn't like it for
that but if you're suffering from dry
hands this will feel like oh the heavens
on your hands just so great I really
have been into this is something I
definitely would repurchase I'm trying
to get through a bunch of hand creams
but when I empty those out I will
probably have like one hand cream that's
lightweight to use in the day and keep
in my purse and then this one by my bad
teas at night just because it's so
amazing and it just helps heal your
hands and get them ready for the day the
next day I love it this is my last like
beauty product this is a candle from
Bath and Body Works this is great this
is Copacabana beach I think I have found
a dupe or the closest to perm never
gonna find - mango beachwood which is
one of my favorite scents ever that
about the body works is put out they
have not put it out in like two or three
years and it's made me so sad and this
one I think I think it did it it's it
smells like Rios most fashionable spot -
Sun and swim comes to life and a beachy
blend of Sunkist coconut ocean watch
driftwood and a hint of sweet Tonka that
is why I like it it smells like coconut
and driftwood instead of mango in
driftwood and so it's like perfect for
me it's even almost better than the
mango one because of the coconut and I
love it I am definitely gonna purchase
backups of this probably like five I
just I love it so much and I just I'm
scared they're not gonna come out with
it again and I'm a hoarder as well so
but I am telling myself that I have to
burn through five candles before I can
get five of these ones so at least I'm
not like making my candle collection go
up any higher I just OH
mmm
check it out you guys definitely should
check this out at your store if you love
coconut you love some reasons this just
isn't only sweet it has that manly scent
to it too it's just beautiful Wow look
at those guys isn't it so cute this is a
little hanging atrium a terrarium I
don't know I don't even know what to
call this but it has little succulents
in it in cactuses and they are real
these are living plants and they're
miniature they are so cute I love them
so much Sam and his mother got this for
me while she was in town and they
absolutely loved it I'm so thankful
it's just exactly what I wanted and I
just love it it's so pretty I love the
colors the green and the orange it's
just beautiful and it's like a piece of
art but also living and I love it I am
excited to have this and I hope I don't
kill it I had succulents before that I
like planted and I was like on this
whole thing they all died so I hope that
this one's fate is different and it's so
cute and I just I love this I can't wait
to hang it in my house I just had to
mention that a couple other non Beauty
favorites I just want to mention I love
Drake I've been like so into Drake it's
insane I love all his CDs he just
dropped a new album so I've been into
that too
his songs are so good I can't even get
into how much I like his music I like to
say his lyrics any chance I can if a
situation even semi could maybe I could
say a lyric I will man Sam I've just
been listening to drink a lot because he
wasn't listening straight because I've
been listening to Drake and she can't
escape it so sorry sorry not sorry
another favorite is Dexter we are now on
season 7 I used to not like this show I
watched like three episodes of it and I
was not into it and then I came back to
it like two years later and now I'm just
into it it's so good I love the show I
love the characters and the actors and
just everything about it I'm really
excited to finish it just so we can move
on to something else but I'm really
enjoying it while we're watching it and
I definitely highly recommend it it is
scoring so if you don't like that you
probably won't like it but maybe will so
if you want to just give it a try it's
on Netflix which is amazing who doesn't
love to binge
watch on Netflix everybody everyone
loves it I guess like kind of all-in-one
my last favorite is moving to California
I'm so excited that me and Sam have made
them about here it's super awesome and
everything I expected and then on top of
that I have started makeup school I've
only been here a month and I just hit
the ground running and came out and now
I'm in makeup school my first day was
yesterday and it's wonderful I'm excited
to learn so many new things actually
learned makeup and from the bottom up
started from the bottom now we here I'm
telling you that's that's my life right
now but I'm just excited to learn so
much and get some great opportunities to
work in the industry that's hopefully
Michael we'll see I'm super excited I'm
thinking about filming videos when I
have to practice different things
practicing that just on film just so I
can make a video but also to get
practicing for school so let me know if
you guys would like that I also think I
just got my kit from school that we pay
for and stuff so I was thinking about
maybe doing a video with like what's in
my makeup kit that I got from school I
don't know how all the products work yet
and we're still obviously learning my
first day was yesterday but I thought it
would be cool if you were interested in
like what like a basic makeup kit that a
school would give you looks like this is
what it look like or if maybe you're
interested in beauty school or maybe you
are in beauty school and you want to see
compare what you got or just different
things like that I don't know I thought
it would be kind of interesting just
California and makeup school and just a
swollen like that me and Sam started has
been so exciting and I'm just even more
excited I've started YouTube I mean
everything's changed everything has
changed in a good way and I am excited
just to see where life takes us and
enjoy it while we can
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
am gonna film more videos in the same
outfit cuz I think I look kind of cute
today
just this is the only thing but I think
I'm gonna film more videos I have a
couple haul videos I want to get up so
I'm gonna be in the same outfit I hope
you guys don't mind that either let me
know if you mind it but I'd rather get
more content up for you guys when I
have the time to film then not film and
then I don't know not have as much
content up so unless it's like a big
thing for you I'm just gonna keep doing
it and keep putting up videos and
content because that's what it's about
it's not about oh I'm in a different
shirt and I'm in a different makeup look
this is real life and in real life I
have you know one day to film and I'm
not going to pretend so that's not my
style at all so um yeah hopefully you
guys don't mind that and I will see you
guys in my next video if you like my
channel please you know come say hi
leave a comment subscribe like it yeah
I'd love to see your videos too so don't
be shy I'm shy I'm not a very big like
branch router but if you branch up to me

do all the work here it's so sorry but
um I will see you guys in my next video
