it's Lauren it feels like forever since
I've talked to you last I don't think I
filmed a video in like two weeks and
then I kind of went a week without
posting a video it's been a crazy crazy
couple of weeks sorry about my phone
it's just been insane I had my final for
school and I was preparing for that then
I actually had my final then I graduated
the next day my mom came into town and I
spent time with her and then I started
my new job right off and then I also put
my two weeks in for my new job already
so I mean if that gives you any type of
outline for how my life has been the
last two weeks then I don't know what
will it's been kind of crazy it's been
very tumultuous and it's been good it's
been bad it's been everything in between
so I thought it would start off my many
videos I have to film with a favorites
video just to be excited about some
things to bring some love into my life
and share with you guys the things that
I have been loving in the month februari
I started last month my top 5 favorites
and i'm already breaking that i have way
more than five favorite didn't get like
seven or eight but not all of them are
beauty some of them are just live
favorites so let's get into some things
i have been loving and let's start this
off really positive and fun yeah what
better way to start off a fun video with
little pom-poms okay i have been loving
these so much this one I got from
Marshalls I also got this one from
Marshalls on my keys but they are so
cute i love them this one i have clipped
on the outside of my bag and it's so
cute it's like dr. Seuss inspired but
it's still edgy because of that black
leather i love the gold hardware i just
love these I think they're so fun I've
seen them around and I just wanted them
for a long time this one looks
absolutely ridiculous and so fun and
it's so easy to find my keys now
and I love them so I thought I would
just start with my like absolute
favorite because it's just too fun not
to I'll show you guys some beauty stuff
now I have been loving this dry shampoo
this is the rock your hair spray at
clean dry shampoo this is the mini that
i got from generation beauty i could not
remember that fell life of me i started
using this and i really really like it i
think it works really well I've just
really enjoyed it so when I was at
marshalls marshals I don't really go in
there much because seriously i buy so
much but when i was there i checked if
they had the big size because they
usually have discounted hair products in
beauty products we all know that my
phone so sorry let's just turn it let's
just stop it sorry again anyway I just
have been loving this so because I was
loving the mini i thought i would pick
up a full-size and see if they had it
and they did and it was 799 so it was
only two dollars more than the batista
kit although this does look like a
bigger bottle and it was just fun to try
something new and really like something
new so I've just been loving this I
think it's a really good one if you have
access to it or if you've been wanting
to try it it is good but it does have
aluminum in it you guys all know about
my dry shampoo video but um yeah just
little shout-out on this guy i've been
loving it sticking with makeup i only
have two more makeup items i'm sorry
guys but it's true i only have two more
this is a brow tint from Ulta it's kind
of like the benefit give me brow the
wand on it is super duper tiny it's so
tiny i hope i'm not too washed out and
it does have little like fibers in it i
have just really been loving this I've
been wanting a more like today you can't
tell because my makeup is very intense
but lately I've been just going more
natural more nude I haven't been doing
pink rouse you guys have been mentioning
it in the comments I'm sorry I miss them
too but you know I I go in phases I'm
telling you like last month I love pink
and i still have pink but I just go in
phases and that's how I am I'm really
intense and passionate about something
and then I kind of move on and find
something new so this has been
something I've been really liking for
just a really easy simple brow and I
feel like it gives me a really natural
look really polished look but it's so
fast and so easy and I've just been
loving this this has been mentioned I
think in my December favorites but I
thought I would just mention it again
because I just love it that much if you
can hear that noise I'm really sorry I'm
telling you I have to film so much so
there's people jamming out next door
people are showering or washing my hands
or whatever that is and we're just gonna
move past it but I love this and I just
think it's a really good one to really
cheap alternative to the benefit one and
I think it works really well the only
thing I have to say about this is that
it doesn't quite dry down so it never
gets to like a really crispy dry finish
so i do feel like if you pack too much
of this on your brow it can kind of feel
like if you touched it it would like
keep the internet of your finger i don't
know if that makes sense but it just
stays kind of malleable and um doesn't
just dry down to like a powder finish or
something so but i still love it i still
use it i still recommend it i still
think it's great this is seriously the
last beauty product i'm sorry guys but
it's been a crazy month alike I've
mentioned and I you know I'm panning a
lot of stuff and for like I shadows and
different things you guys know I just
I've been using the same stuff so this
is something that I've rediscovered this
month and I've really been liking it's
what i'm wearing on my lips now and this
is buck Sims dolly these are their full
on lipsticks and you know I'm not a
lipstick person or really a lip person
at all when it comes to cosmetics we all
know this but this is my favorite format
for a lip product I just love how easy
and simple this is it's just easy to use
this is a nice matte formula it's minty
i will give you guys a swatch they're
the worst swatch in history that's it
there again it's on my lips I just think
this is such a pretty color if you're
fair-skinned it's gonna look like a
darker mafi nude if you are darker skin
it's going to look like a nice light
like a light nude it's just gonna look
good on everyone I think it just works
really well it stings on the lips really
nicely because of the fact that it's
like a more matte finish i'm pretty sure
it's matt it's basically Matt but anyway
just really like this if you guys were
looking into it or yeah again you're
looking for that kind of a nude color I
really really recommend dolly from buxom
and buxom is being sold at Ulta it's no
longer a support exclusive which is
super awesome so you can get your points
I recently just bought stuff from Ulta
and I probably will do a haul soon but I
really I you know I haven't shopped on
there a lot lately because i just do
support because it's easy but it's so
nice that ulta does the point at least
you're getting you know points back to
get money off your purchase and if they
carry a lot of the same brands you know
as sephora i just i really like that
system i think it just feels more like
you're being rewarded and I like that
because I spend a lot of money on makeup
and I want to get deals on it if I can
I'm you know I'm a good shopper and I
want to be rewarded so anyway back to
this really like this and definitely
pick it up if you've been looking at it
my camera is about to do and we're just
starting this is the first video I'm
filming out of like seriously five today
another item or thing I've been loving
it's not makeup but it is kind of
fashion style related or my new glasses
they're so pretty I love them so so much
when I went back into town for Christmas
I went to the glasses doctor optometrist
I believe that are called and i got
these glasses these are from Prada my
other glasses are also product I just
happened to really like prada glasses
and I love them I'll show you what they
look like on oh they're not too bad with
the glare I mean that kind of bad but
they're so cute I think that I feel like
smart but also like retro and I just
really like him it's just been nice to
have something new and something
different for my glasses and they have
like a foot on the nose so they don't
slide down as much and I feel like they
don't ruin my makeup as much throughout
the day i can smile and my cheeks don't
touch the bottom even though there are
bigger loss than my other glasses so i
have just been loving these i feel just
so cute in them Sam also thinks they're
cute which makes me feel even more cute
they've just been a favorite
I do spend a lot of money on my glasses
because I don't have contacts and I'm
just someone that if I'm gonna wear
glasses I really want to love them I
want to feel cute I don't want to feel
like they're a burden or that I just
don't like them so that's just me
personally plus we had a lot of money in
our account like for insurance at the
end of the year and we had to use it
anyway so it worked out it worked out
girl you deserve it drake quotes what
else can talk about what else have i
been loving number this gun number four
but it's not really number four because
i added a bunch of other things but
something I've really been loving in the
month of februari and just got into is
reading books you guys know I've been
wanting to read books on my Instagram
I've been showing you guys the books
I've been reading and as I finished them
and whatnot it's just been interesting
to delve into the world of booktube I
never knew what that was before I'm very
much when I go to you on YouTube I just
watched beauty videos and now that I'm
in a part of the project panting
community which is like a subset of the
beauty community I really only watch our
videos and it's not because I don't like
watching other ones I just don't branch
out I just I only have so much time to
watch videos so I just kind of stick to
what's in my subscription feed and I was
watching a video by miss Jules ease
Jules ease I think it's how you say it I
wrote it down yeah miss Jules ease her
name's Julia and she was it was like a
TBR to be read is what that stands for
but it was like a wrap up video and what
she's going to be reading the next month
kind of like how we do project use it up
videos for each month but with books and
it was super interesting to watch I
really enjoyed it i will link her
channel down below and that video but it
was just really fun to watch and she
seems just so intelligent and it just
really got me inspired to read more
books and really try to make time for
reading books because I watch a lot of
YouTube me and Sam are really big movie
people and show people it's what we like
to do in our spare time he wants to act
so it's just a big part of our world and
so I'm just wanting to kind of
reposition how I spend my time better
that I can make time for reading because
I think it's really important I really
do like it I just find that I put on the
back burner and then never get to it so
I watched her video and that kind of led
me down this rabbit hole of looking at
all these other people who are part of
the booktube community and its channels
strictly dedicated to reading books book
reviews doing buddy systems it's just a
whole big thing if you're interested in
books and you like reading definitely
look into it another person I really
have been loving is a book all of her
name's olive and she's so awesome I
really like her too she just seems so
intelligent and I just have enjoyed
watching her videos so so much and yeah
I just really like her video so I
believe her channel link down below to
but that's just been a big part of how
I've been trying to spend my time and
reevaluate my time plus it's been nice
because it's giving me a break from just
watching like new haul videos and beauty
videos and things that make me want to
buy makeup instead I'm just kind of
branching out and really realizing that
there's other things besides makeup to
love and to kind of put my time and
money towards so I'm really excited
about that new love and finding
different places on YouTube that i feel
like i enjoy and kind of want to you
know discover more from if that makes
sense last favorite for februari and
really I saved the best for last on this
one because it's kind of a bunch of
things but it's really just my final
four school graduating from school and I
also wanted to awards at graduation so
if you guys aren't following me on
instagram you can see my final or two of
my final pictures I only took two and
post it in there because I wasn't trying
to bombard you but I did do my look on
Sam and I made him into this kind of
tribal caveman-esque creature thing we
had to our final requirements we were
given random foam latex appliances on
the day and so I kind of had this idea
of how I would kind of make any foam
latex pieces I got work into this kind
of caveman type of look and it looked
really great i'm really happy with how
it turned out i am a beauty girl i love
glitter and pink
and you know the more beauty aspect of
makeup so when it came to creatures in
foam latex it really was something that
I was uncomfortable with and I just
didn't know how much I'd like it I
wasn't like insanely excited plus I
personally hate having that stuff on my
face like get it off it kind of freaks
me out I kind of have this whole issue
with it personally but I'm so happy to
have found almost like a love for it and
I just think it's so fun there's so much
you can do with foam latex and you can
really just change someone's whole
silhouette their structure of their face
it looks so good I'm I'm just really
happy and I'm really excited to kind of
try doing more foam latex looks it just
was really fun to do so I'm really happy
with how my final turned out and that
was really exciting because it was my
last look I'm really glad I like went
out with a bang I felt proud of my look
and then the next day we had graduation
I'm really proud of myself for
graduating you know me and Sam have
really only been out here a little over
a year I've already finished makeup
school which was a year long it's just
been like a crazy ride and then YouTube
and all this it's just been a lot and
I'm just really happy and proud of
myself for graduating and sticking
through and then at graduation they gave
out two awards won for outstanding
student and won for outstanding makeup
artist and I felt so incredibly honored
and just so excited I didn't know they
gave out awards at graduation and I won
both of them out of my class and I just
you know can't believe it all the
teachers voted on you know the students
who would do it they nominated three
different students each which we didn't
know about either and tell like they run
off the nominees and then who won kind
of like the Oscars but without knowing
the nominees and I just feel really
blessed um I also feel like just
thankful to my teachers and to everyone
who supported me and tried to help me
grow and I just feel really proud of
myself for everything that I worked
really hard on last year during school
even
I was working full time and I still made
it to school and still try to do my best
on all the makeup looks that I could and
I just feel so happy that they like saw
how hard I worked and that not only did
it get outstanding student which was
more of like the kind of technical
aspect like being on time and doing well
on tests and kind of just more
categorized like that in being a good
student but then also got the creative
side in and that not only am I punctual
and all of those things but I'm also
creative and can execute my looks well
and you know I'm an artist to that I won
both of those I just I just feel very
happy and blessed and thankful and I I
worked really hard and it feels really
really good to kind of get that
recognition and it's definitely a
favorite for sure it was just an awesome
moment to for my mom to be there my
husband to be there for me to just let
them see all my hard work kind of summed
up in that moment so anyway those are
all my favorites guys I hope you enjoyed
this video I'm going to be filming so so
so so much more so I hope you guys
enjoyed this look too because um you
will be seeing me in it a lot longer I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
thank you so much for your love and
support as always and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
