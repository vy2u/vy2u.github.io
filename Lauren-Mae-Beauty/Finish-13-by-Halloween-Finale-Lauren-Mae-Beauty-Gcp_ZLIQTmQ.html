learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be finishing up my
finished 13 by Halloween
that means it's Halloween today happy
Halloween guys I hope you guys are doing
something fun if you have kids you're
taking them out if you don't and you're
just like celebrating on a Tuesday like
go for it do your thing I'm mostly
celebrated Halloween on Saturday nights
so I probably won't be doing anything
like to Halloweeny tonight besides this
video this is Halloween II right so
posting this will be fun when you say
posting a video will be fun
what does that say about you oh my gosh
okay anyway I'm super excited for this
finale this project is really successful
and it's just one of my favorite
projects to do throughout the year on
top of that I'm so excited for the video
I will be posting tomorrow it's going to
be the intro to the 12 pants Christmas
is stay tuned for that it's a huge
collab I'm so excited that everyone is
like joined in and that'll be exciting
to start something new I haven't even
picked buy items yet so I probably
should do that I'm gonna film it
tomorrow but anyway that being said some
of the videos that I'm filming today are
gonna be like interspersed with that
video so just know that that's gonna be
happening it's just kind of how it's
gonna work out so I can get the videos I
need up on the right days that I need
them up I know I know enough of the
boring crap let's get into my progress
I'm going to show you guys the items
that I finished up first and then we'll
move in to the items that I didn't
finish up and we'll talk about it as we
go we all know that I used this up I'm
like done talking about it this is the
Revlon Colorstay I under eye concealer
it was nice I liked it it was kind of
expensive for how fast it went how many
I mean I can't say it more than that I
did enjoy it though when I have it
something I really did like was the
first aid Beauty coconut skin smoothie
priming moisturizer I'm potentially
gonna repurchase this I just don't have
the money at the moment and I have quite
a few primers but I thought this is
really nice for like more of a
moisturizing primer or something that
actually feels like a moisturizer it
doesn't feel like silicone and it's
gonna give you a bit of a glow one of
the first powders that I finished up in
the project was the black opal invisible
oil blotting powder I didn't have much
of this and I just repressed it and
finish it up so this is the empty
compact all the way used up
one of the biggest wins in this project
was the Milani bronzer I wanted to just
hit pan on this item that was like my
number one goal and then I hit pan and
then I kept going and it is completely
gone you can see the terracotta plate
because this is a baked product
specifically this bronzer in the shade
sunset Oh 8 was one of the like more
matte ones that was limited-edition I
did enjoy this and I also didn't enjoy
this the color sometimes looked a little
orange if I went too heavy-handed it
just wasn't a bronzer that I felt
comfortable using you know all the time
I just know it's not gonna do me wrong
that was not this bronzer so I'm glad I
used it up I did enjoyed it and hate it
but I wouldn't repurchase it if it was
out today another one that I was really
excited I used up was the Maybelline
master conceal concealer in the shade
light I actually did like this the shade
light was a little bit dark for me
though so if I could go back I
potentially would repurchase the fair
one of this I think you get a lot of
product this gives you quite a bit of
coverage as well so if you like a more
heavy coverage concealer
you'll probably really like this one my
all-time favorite concealer is the
Maybelline fit me so that's the one that
I know for sure I'll repurchase but I
did like this and I thought it was nice
so I could see myself repurchasing it
another powder that I was able to use up
was the pure foreign one press mineral
makeup foundation powder this is
actually my second one of these I've
used up a full one I bought it at
generation Beauty not this year but like
not the year before that like 2015 then
beginning a 2016 actually and then this
is my second one that I got through
octoly I did really like this product I
think it's nice this definitely won't
control your oils though so if you're
someone who's looking for a powder
foundation to like keep you mad I don't
find that this does that but this looks
really nice on the skin if you want
something that's really easy and fast
you can just buff this on get some good
coverage and then go on with your day
it's just like an easy product and
that's why I like it I'm glad it's gone
though I did have it for a while so
that's all you said okay so how many is
that now let's count one two three four
five six that's the sixth item number
seven I did use up a tiny little oil
sample packet which I know is kind of
lame
but I'm counting it guys because I never
used my foil samples I just don't enjoy
using them so I was really proud of
myself and it was the it cosmetics bye
bye redness little sample that you put
on your face and it's supposed to
guarantee redness I actually really
enjoyed this product it was very thin it
had pretty good coverage but it still
looked really natural on the skin I
mentioned that this was a little bit
dark for me because it used to only come
in one color but I have heard that it
comes in multiple shades now so I think
it does come in like a porcelain color
and that might work better for me so I
don't know if I would repurchase this
but I did enjoy it and I wouldn't mind
getting a sample of the lighter shade to
see if it works with my skin tone I was
just happy that it was a really good
product you know I thought it lived up
to the hype I feel like so many people
have had about that product next is
something that I didn't use up but I did
declutter and that is the Smashbox pore
minimizing primer this used to be one of
my Holy Grails I've gone through
multiple of those packages before I
don't have it with me anymore but it
just doesn't work for me it's not what I
like anymore I used to love like super
matte super powder like stay in place
kind of cakey makeup that was like my
go-to for my skin and I'm definitely
into a lighter look now I kind of liked
my oils breaking through throughout the
day so that I can easily touch up and
kind of just like fix my makeup with my
fingers instead of having this kind of
situation where it looks good for maybe
the first five hours but then once
things go downhill it just I mean it's
patching off here and patching off here
but then full coverage here I don't like
that look so that just like added to
that I also feel like it was really dry
oh I think the dogs are done barking for
the moment we'll see but for that
primary it just was a little bit drying
it wasn't something that it's not
something that I want to prep my skin
with anymore so yeah it's I'm done with
it
the next item that we all know I used up
was this eyeliner from Urban Decay you
can't even tell it's an eyeliner anymore
it's like wait what is that
but um yeah this is what the finished
eyeliner looks like super happy about
that that one started off I feel like
pretty long like maybe as long as my
finger or somewhere in between here so I
only got some good use out of that
throughout the project another powder
that you guys know I finished up this is
the third one now if in case you're
counting but this is the Lockett setting
powder from Kat Von D I use this all the
way up I even took the stopper out and
this is just something I had a love-hate
relationship with I don't think that
this is very lightweight on the skin I
can get definitely adds a bit of a layer
and so that's why I don't like it
and I think that's everything for what I
had used that so the two new things that
I did use up are the eyeliners I did use
up the white liner from Stila that's how
small it is I can't use it anymore it
hurts my eyes and when I went to sharpen
it like a big chunk of it fell off so
I'm calling it quits I'm so sad this is
my favorite white eyeliner I've ever
used but it's time for it to go it's
getting old and I'm glad I used it up
all the way and then the other eyeliner
I had was the laura geller brown sugar
eyeliner now I'm not gonna lie to you
guys the tiniest little piece that I had
left did end up flying out and actually
hitting the floor I know we had a couple
scares about that but it finally
actually happened and so I'm counting
this as done I'm gonna count it in my
empties I used up the majority of this
product I probably didn't use up like
that much so I'm so happy this is gone I
wish I hadn't broken off but it did and
I'm not gonna let it negate all the
awesome progress that I did have on that
product so those are all the items that
I used up that means that I was one item
away I used of twelve items instead of
thirteen I'm a little bit sad about that
because I was so so close to hitting my
goal but at the same time I'm so happy
with that much progress that's
absolutely amazing and I do have some
really good progress on the items that
I'm going to show you some of them not
so much but some of them I'm so so close
it was like I you know if I had one more
week I would have definitely hit 13
items so let's get into those what are
the ones I'm really proud of is the
Revlon nearly naked powder this is in
the shade fair and I'm oh so close guys
I'm gonna probably finish this up in
November I can't imagine it taking any
longer than that and it just just didn't
work out I was so close I tried guys so
something that I still need to work on
the other item that was SuperDuper close
I mean I'm telling you a couple uses
away is the eyeshadow from starlets in
the shade of pearl it's gonna look like
I used it all up from this far away but
you'll see in the close-up that there is
just the tiniest little ring left on
this guy I've been using this as a face
highlight and really enjoying it so I'm
going to continue doing that and I'm so
happy I threw this in this project
because I actually am going to get done
with it and that is so exciting it's
hard to use up an entire eyeshadow like
for me I feel pretty satisfied by just
using a shadow until I hit pan and then
I feel like I basically got my money's
worth but using it up entirely is just
an even bigger goal and that's really
exciting something that had a lot of
progress but I didn't get much progress
on between last update and this one is
the vivillon cream foundation it
basically looks more or less the same
haven't used at a ton I still really
like it but I I'm getting a little bit
light for it so I might have to save
this until the beginning of next year
and then finish it off then
I also didn't make a lot of progress on
the Kat Von D alchemist this is
something that I was using so much at
the beginning of the project and then
just kind of you know moved on to other
things I like to cycle out my makeup and
just use what I'm inspired to use so I
just haven't been using this as much as
I was at the beginning when I first
picked the products to put in this
project but I am really happy that I did
use it I can see definite use and wear
and dips in these products which is
always a success two more items to talk
about NARS rakubian I threw this in and
after a couple of updates and I just I
mean I like this product a lot it's just
getting kind of old so I'm gonna keep
this until the end of the year and then
I will need to declutter just because
it's that old it's a pretty color I've
used it quite a few times like I
definitely would say more than if I
hadn't thrown it in here but there's no
significant progress or use on it and
same with this one from Eden minerals
this is the concealer in half torn I
really like the texture of this product
but it's just not something I've been
gravitating to as of lately I think once
we get into winter and I need something
a bit more hydrating this would be nice
but I just want a little bit more
coverage at the moment and this has a
little bit lighter coverage a little bit
more moisturizing of a formula and it's
just not quite what I've been reaching
for it lately so I still really like
this I'm gonna keep using it but I don't
think I'll throw it in a project again
and that is everything for my finish 13
by Halloween guys I hope you enjoyed
this final update finales are just so
crazy when I think about the fact that I
started this like what four months ago
it's so weird and I'm so excited to kind
of do this end-of-the-year project come
together with the community and
hopefully get some things used up again
stay tuned for that project that intro
is going to be up tomorrow and other
than that I will see you then bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
