learned thank you so much for watching I
was only gonna film three videos today
but then I just like love this I look so
much that I was like I don't want to
waste it I want to film more videos so
there will be four videos this one no is
my project pan update for my finish 13
by Halloween update number to definitely
check the description if you haven't
seen the intro or update number one it
will be linked down there so you can
catch up and see where we started where
we're at I am a bit late on this update
so it has been more a little over a
month but I do have some good progress
to share with you guys and we have about
two months left like a little less than
two months so I think that I can get
some good things finished and I'm really
excited to let you just get into my
progress I'm just gonna start off with
the product we argue now I finished this
is the Revlon under-eye concealer I
started here and then the product gets
pushed up and it's all going on I talked
about this in the last video but these
go so fast and they click up pens that I
just I find that they're not worth it
essentially there's just not enough
product in here for the price at the
drugstore is making me pay so I did like
the formula but I would not repurchase
for the full price next are all new
things that I finished this is the Hello
fat coconut skin smoothie priming
moisturizer from first aid Beauty I
talked about this in my last video
saying I did enjoy it but I don't know
if either purchase it but honestly I'm
missing this and I kind of want to
purchase it
so since I'm missing it don't be
surprised if I do pick this up this
retails for $28 in the full-size which
is not bad for a full sized primer
compared to like some of the other
brands so I did really like this and I
do suggest it I miss it and it's
finished so I started with it full last
update I was here and then I finished
the rest up in this last month
the next product that he used up is the
black opal powder this was so close we
all knew I was going to finish it up but
it is entirely gone now I'm happy to
have this done it was on a ton of
product but it's just kind of bulk out
of my collection which is nice
next we'll talk about some products that
I have really good progress on the first
one here is the vivillon cream compact
and medium light I am making great great
strides I did have pan when I first
started but I definitely move the pan
over this way I really want to clear out
all the pan and just start working on
one side so maybe I only have half of
this up I'm not sure if I'm gonna use
all of this up by the end of October but
I am happy with how much progress I'm
making on this item and I'm excited to
try to finish up the next item I'm
probably the most excited and proud of
is this Milani baked bronzer when I
first put this in it didn't have any pan
it must have been so close though
because I'm just really trucking along
guys I have like barely any product left
that's it you guys will see pictures as
I'm talking about these products but I'm
so so excited that this is almost gone
I'm continuing to use it I really want
to finish this before I really want to
finish it this a month if I can it's
just I like it I'm wearing it today it's
a little bit orange sometimes though I
don't know I just have a love-hate
relationship with it so I think it's
just time for it to go I will not be
missing it in my collection I have other
bronzers I like it better but I did
enjoy it enough to use it and I will be
so happy to use up a full size bronzer
that one feels so good another almost
done item this is the Maybelline master
conceal in the shade light I started
this project with it up here my first
update and this is kind of where I'm at
now although I'm telling you I have to
really contort the bottle I have barely
anything left in this so I definitely
think I will be done with this by next
update I honestly don't even know if I'd
have a week's worth of wear if I wore
makeup every single day in this
container so I'm really happy about that
I'm excited I do think this is a nice
concealer I just this was just slightly
too dark for me so I would want the fair
color and I would potentially repurchase
it again it has a nice coverage it's not
overly drying but it definitely has
quite a bit of pigment to it and I think
it's a great value you do get a lot of
product in here it's very sanitary which
I also really like so I do like this but
so excited to tees it up I think the
next best progress that's so hard to say
this is from pure and it's the four in
one powder I did repress this really
crappily but there it is I only have a
couple more uses out of this so I will
finish this up for sure next time I was
kind of sad I didn't have it finished by
this update but it is what it is it'll
be another empty for next update
something I forgot to mention at the
beginning with my finished products this
is neat bye bye redness from it
cosmetics I threw in a sample in here
it's kind of a giving product but I
don't really like file sample packets so
I knew I would need a push to kind of
use this item and I didn't want to
really try it out I really liked this
it's just a little too dark for me and
somewhere I can make it work but it
definitely would not work for me in
winter someone to tell me in the
comments so that they did come out with
a porcelain shade of this which is
amazing I do want to try that out
because I like using this just as my
foundation like if I want something
really really just simple and something
that I don't really have to think about
this is awesome and it gives me it's
such a thin product that's what I like
about the most so thin gives you quite a
bit of coverage them really evens out
your skin tone well still feel natural
it doesn't leave like it doesn't feel
heavy
it doesn't feel thick and it's just good
I did really like this so if I could
find the porcelain one especially at
Sephora I would purchase this onto just
the other items I have the Revlon powder
here I'm making progress in it but now
that I kind of have more progress on my
other powders this will definitely get
more use it's a nice I would repurchase
this I think that the nearly naked line
is getting like discontinued I don't
know if that's true but I feel like it's
kind of hard to find online
the Smashbox pore minimizer still
haven't used it ah if I don't finish
this up in this project I'm probably
just going to declutter it because it's
not something I really like go for
anymore
I'm going to try using it in conjunction
with other primers and not use this all
over my face but just use it in my pores
and on my nose and see if that's the way
I can use it up but no progress on this
still four liners I am so close so this
one's been so close for forever I'm
gonna sharpen this little guy until I
just can't sharpen it anymore it's the
best white eyeliner that I've ever used
it's from Stila and they discontinued it
you can't buy it anymore which is so sad
if I could I would repurchase this I
wouldn't even branch out and find
something new because everything else
I've ever tried sucks and this just
stays in my waterline it's super opaque
so I barely need any of it it doesn't
irritate my eyes it's just so good the
next one here is the Urban Decay one
again so so close when I put the cap on
it's all silver you know that you're
getting close with the Urban Decay ones
when that happens I'm gonna sharpen this
probably one more time I don't know how
much more you said I can get out of this
but this will for sure be done by next
update and the last liner in here this
one is from Laura Geller and it's the
color brown sugar I believe this color
was like limited edition or in some type
of set so you can't buy it individually
but that's all I have left on it I've
definitely made some good progress and
once that urban decay liner is gone I
really think I can focus on this and get
this gone so I'm not worried about this
I wouldn't be surprised if I even had it
done by the next update maybe I don't
know we'll see I think we only have a
few more items this one here is Kat Von
D's Alchemist palette I want to hit pan
on one of these and I don't know if I'm
gonna do it guys I just haven't been
reaching for duochrome as much as I was
when I first put this in the project two
months ago I'm gonna still try and use
this as much as possible and just get
some nice square out of it I still
really like the palette quality-wise I
think it's great it's just like I go in
phases of things that I like and what I
don't
and what I'm into and one other thing
I've learned of app and is that I want
to still be inspired by my makeup that's
the fun thing you love so I don't want
to stifle creativity just to use things
up so that's why I'm not like putting
too much pressure on myself to use this
I think this is the last item and this
is something I added in last time
because I'm kind of adding things in as
I use them up this is NARS rakubian and
I do really like this I have sharpened
it a couple times I don't have like
lines I just the paper and everything is
just too much for me honestly I know
that's horrible but I'm hoping to use
this up or at least get some really
really good progress on it so I can
finish it up by the end of the year I do
really like this color and I do like the
formula from NARS but this is just
getting old and I don't want it to go to
waste so I'm hoping to use it up since I
did use up three items technically I'm
gonna add in three more some of these
are a little bit more give me or their
in other projects like year-long project
so I think it'd be a great way to like
double task them this first one here is
such a give me this is the Kat Von D
locket translucent setting powder like
come on guys there's barely anything
left and I just want to force myself to
finish this up have a reason to use this
up I feel like I'm not really reaching
for this one because it's not my
favorite but also because I'm trying to
reach for other powders that are in
projects so if this isn't a project I
think I'll reach for it and finish it up
and this is so bulky I'll be happy to
get this out of my collection next is a
concealer sometimes almost done with the
Enabling one I thought I would throw
this one in because this isn't my
products I want to finish up by the end
of the year if you haven't seen that
I'll leave it linked this is from Eden
minerals and this is just one of those
like click up concealers this is also
really light for me so I think it'll be
nice to transition into fall and it's
very sheer at the same time though so it
doesn't give you a ton of coverage and
again that's kind of what I'm more into
so I think it'll be nice to use this up
and enjoy it and I think it'll work nice
for the season change and the last thing
that I want to finish up by the 31st is
this shadow from starlooks this is a
color pearl they do not make this shadow
anymore
I've already hit major pan and I just
want to finish it up I'm so close it's
in my finished 17 in 2017
so it's just kind of another reason to
use it this is really really pretty I
like using it as a face highlight I also
like using it on the lid just setting
the lid it is shimmery but I find that
it works well for whatever reason I also
like it as a lid color I like it on the
inner corner so there are a lot of
different ways I can use this up and
hopefully get it gone by Halloween and
that's everything from I finished 13 by
Halloween update I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I hope you guys are doing
well in your projects as well and I will
see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
