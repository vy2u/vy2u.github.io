Lauren thank you so much for watching
today is going to be an update on my
finished 13 by Halloween I'm so excited
I have a lot of Awesome progress and I
can't wait to show you guys so let's
just get into it
as always I'm gonna start off with the
items that I have used up so since the
beginning this has been the first one to
go this is the Revlon Colorstay
under-eye concealer it's in the shake
fair I got this at big lot so now that
makes me wonder how old was this thing
but either way it was nice and I did
enjoy it
it just goes too fast like I said so I'm
glad I got through this and I'm glad I
enjoyed it while I had it next I have
the first aid Beauty coconut skin
smoothie priming moisturizer really like
this stuff I'm definitely considering
buying the full size it's on my list so
I do highly suggest this especially if
you're looking for something that isn't
silicone II and it's going to give you a
lot of moisture to your skin if you have
dry skin or even combination skin I have
oily skin and I still like it but I do
like a more dewy complexion so I do
highly suggest this and I really like it
I finished up this black opal
translucent powder this is something
that I use on set I actually don't have
one in my set bag at the moment but I do
really like this there was not that much
product in here when I finished it so it
was just something to get out of my
collection and finish up so that it
wasn't just hanging around something
that I finished up that I am so proud of
that is new to you guys this is the
Milani bronzer and it is all the way
gone I am so proud of this one my goal
is just to hit pan in this thing and
it's gone and a month early it's gone
I had a love-hate relationship with this
definitely toward the end sometimes it
would look really pretty sometimes it
would look kind of orange on me so I'm
really happy to get this gone using it
before say this bronzer is a really big
deal and I'm really proud of myself this
also I don't know I it didn't have as
much product as I thought on it like
left I must have used more than I had
originally thought so so happy and
surprised at this one very very happy
something that I don't think I had
finished up last time is the Maybelline
master conceal in light I did enjoy this
I think you get a lot of product for
your money so I would potentially look
into this in the future I do have a new
primer coming to me from octoly it's the
Estee Lauder Double Wear waterproof
concealer and a tube like this so
I kind of wonder just based off of
packaging how similar they are so we'll
see but yeah I did enjoy this I'm really
glad it's gone though I did finish up
the pure powder foundation so happy
about that there was barely anything
left I had repressed it and I finally
just used it up it only took a couple of
times with my makeup to finish it so
happy about that
I'm telling you these things are like
dropping like flies I'm so happy you
guys know I use it the it cosmetics
little sample pack I don't use foil
packets they don't usually really like
them so I'm really happy I got you said
if it got to try a new product
especially cuz it was something I did
want to try and I did really enjoy it so
I did not keep the little foil packet it
just was gonna get too messy and I just
threw it away but I did finish that up I
finally finished the liner from Urban
Decay
it looks sharpened right now but it's
like a wax core and so it was kind of
like hurting my eyeball I think we all
can count this as done so I'm really
happy about that glad I got an eyeliner
out and last four all the way used up as
I did finish up this Kat Von D locket
setting powder I took out the sifter and
just used it up I didn't enjoy it at the
end but I'm happy it's gone I don't hate
this I just don't think it works for
baking it's just too heavy on the skin
and it kind of can go a little patchy
especially if you're using like a damp
sponge more than anything I'm just glad
that it's gone because this is such a
huge package and they're just other
loose setting powders I want to try
something that isn't gone but I am going
to be declutter and this is the Smashbox
photo finish primer I have not touched
this and I don't want to touch it this
is just a little bit too drying on my
skin right now it's not something that I
enjoy using and I'm not gonna force
myself to use up even that much of it so
I will be passing this along to someone
because it is still good so for me that
counts as something like used up because
it is no longer in my collection so
right now I have used up one two three I
have used up ten products so I only need
to use up three more to hit my goal of
using up 13 by Halloween and I have a
month to do that so let me show you the
progress I've made on the other items
and I will not be adding any new items
to this project because I have quite a
few left that are like on their last
legs and I just don't think I need to
add in more stuff so first here is the
Revlon nearly naked powder I have been
using this now that the other powders
are gone out of the project it's kind of
a lot of product for a month but I also
could totally see myself using it up so
if I just stick to this powder I think
it might be doable so I'm gonna try and
use this up by Halloween my vivillon
creme foundation I've honestly only used
this once in to get ready with me that I
used for this look if you guys want a
tutorial or get ready with me on this
it'll be linked down below but it's like
pretty similar to where it was honestly
to me I've basically hit the bowl I
wanted to with this initially is just
like get more progress see more pan and
all that but I would like to just try to
like get a little bit more gone like
even if I just use this 10 times next
month so a third of the month I would be
happy with that I have two liners still
this is the steel a white liner it's so
close to being done it will be done by
the end of the project I'm sad about
that because this is my favorite white
liner but you know it is nice to have it
out it is old so I guess that's good
this other liner is from Laura Geller
and oh shoot well I guess it's gone the
base had broken off with this and so
when I opened it it just flew out and
now it's somewhere on my floor I don't
want to step on it well it doesn't
matter if I find it because I'm not
gonna be using it that is so
disappointing because I literally have
like this much left of it and I was so
close to actually finishing it up and
using it all up but I technically didn't
but now I only need to finish two more
items oh my gosh it didn't fall on the
floor guys oh my gosh it's in here it's
in my basket I'm still gonna try to use
it I know that's like crazy but it's so
close guys that's all I have left I am
so glad this didn't fall on the floor
okay we're back to using three more
items so I only have a little bit left
of that something from the original 13 I
put in here this is the Kat Von D
Alchemist palette I probably won't hit
pan on this item which was my goal
but since I added in the other things
for this project it won't be a big deal
I'll still hit 13 I just haven't been
into the duochrome as much lately so
hopefully I'll get into it soon and can
hit some pan on this at some point
before the years up I do have a lip
product in here it's what I'm wearing
now it's NARS or coogan I'm doing a
really good job of trying to use this up
the pencil in here is definitely getting
dry though so I'm glad I'm almost done
with this I don't think I'll be finished
by this project but I am going to be
working on this till the end of the year
to hopefully move it out before the year
is over the ether minerals pen concealer
I don't know how much of this I have
left but I'm just going to continue
working on it and hopefully I can get it
done soon and laughs
this is the star Lux eyes shadow and I'm
using this as a highlighter for the most
part I will show pictures obviously like
I have everything else and I am
definitely close on this if I repress
this and really use it every single day
next month I think I could get this gone
and this could be one of the three
things I actually finish up so that is
my progress on my Halloween items I hope
you guys enjoyed this update I know this
was like a really exciting one so that's
always so great and I'm really happy
that I really first see ibly can hit my
goal for this not every project is like
that for me or for anyone like you just
you know put things in here do your best
try to make as much progress as possible
and use up what you can but it is always
super exciting when you actually can hit
your goal so that is everything thank
you so so much for watching guys and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
