Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing an update
and a finale on a project that I started
earlier this year at the very beginning
this is actually a collab project Claire
from the crimson feather invited me to
join in and this was a finished 17 in
2017 and the theme for this project was
textures when you get married every
single year of marriage just like a
different like gift that you would give
so that's how we picked these items like
basically from year 1 to 17 and that's
our inspiration anyway we'll get into it
as we go I'm gonna leave the first
videos down below also please go check
on everyone in the collab I know since
this is like a year-long project I feel
like things have gotten like kind of
mixed around and everything like that
some people have I think I know al I
think is done with this project I'm
putting it now so it's kind of crazy but
please go check out the ladies linked
down below and if you like project pans
they all do project pans so okay so
let's just get into it I'm gonna go down
the list and let you guys know like one
by one what my items were and where I'm
at the reason I'm going to be ending
this project is just because I feel like
I'm either finished everything up it's
on its last leg it's been declared or
it's something that I didn't really work
on at all I'm not anywhere near close to
finishing or hitting that goal and I
don't really want to so um that is the
reason that it's just gonna there's just
no reason I so I can update you guys in
a month-and-a-half thing like yeah still
didn't use this item that being said
let's get into it the first item was
paper and for that I chose these Tasha
blotting papers there was barely
anything in here this was like a Ghibli
product the most giving product I've
ever done so yeah I did finish that up
I'm happy about that
I can't wait to throw the stuff away
I've been holding on to some of that for
a really long time
next number two was cotton and for that
I decided to throw in all of my sheet
masks now I've mentioned before I don't
like sheet masks I feel very
claustrophobic in them and at the
beginning of this project I had 9 but as
I've collected things that are there
more sheet masks or things that are
similar and in similar packaging to
sheet masks I'm just kind of through
in here just to kind of like force
myself to use it up now I have ended up
using three I used this my little eye
patch from Tony moly
this is the talika bio enzymes mask I
think I did this with Sam and then I
also have this good erm snail jelly mask
I mean I don't really have too much of a
review to give because they're not my
favorite so I'm just showing you guys I
used em up to keep going I have quite a
few left this is something I'm working
on now it's not a face mask it's
actually a scrub it's in my shower
because I'm working on this for the
month in my project use it up I am also
working on three other pieces so this is
the bio peel gauze peeling lemon from
neo gen this is not a mask I variants
like a you know exfoliating pad that you
put on your face I have a pathology one
this is the illuminate flash mask I want
to use that one up I have two more from
Skid derm these are the snail jelly
masks again I have like a whole pack of
these because I got them from octiline
and I have even given some away it had
so many in it it was a great price for
the amount of masks you up but again
masks are just not my thing
she messed I like regular masks I have
the Daniel line lemongrass facial sheet
from flora P flora P and last here I
have this White Rose mask and I have
made a lot of progress I'm happy about
that I definitely have less than nine
when I started so that's good I
definitely think I can finish if I
really really try to put my heart into
it but I'll let you guys know you'll see
them on my empties since this project is
ending I am so sorry for like the noise
I know you can hear that it's just crazy
it sounds like military stuff is
happening outside that's how crazy it
sounds number three was leather and for
that I decided to pick the laura mercier
artist palette this has like the leather
outside that was my inspiration and my
goal was to hit pan on one of these
eyeshadows now I did already start with
pan and these too so those don't count
and I just haven't been using this this
has been in my kid for a little bit I
haven't been using it in my kit but
have been bringing it with me just in
case I just haven't been inspired to use
these purples so that's the reason I
haven't made any progress on that I
still think this is a great palette but
it's nothing that's inspiring me
currently so I'm not gonna worry about
trying to hit pan on that eye shadow
next was fruit / flowers and for that I
kind of went with the floral theme and
put this bath and Bodyworks candle in
here this is the scent sundress and it's
very floral it's super weird this smell
really reminds me of our old apartment
here in LA and it has a lot of bad
memories attached to it it's really
weird I was in a really bad mental place
um anyway I won't get into that it's
just weird how scents can do that songs
can do that for me too but I just
finished this up I'm not trying to like
get too deep here I did finish this up
and it was okay now that I'm smelling it
I would never purchase that candle again
no another plane now a siren it's quite
insane that's Friday for you guys Friday
happy Friday
it won't be Friday when I upload this
but you know the next item was wood and
I actually don't have that with me
anymore I put in the tart powder
foundation that has like a bamboo cap on
it I decided to declutter that item this
is something I've been trying to work on
forever ever it's too dark for me it
doesn't work I don't want to compromise
having my skin look bad just so I can
finish up an item so I did end up
decluttering that so it is no longer in
the project which is a win you know it's
still an item moved out number 6 is
something I actually just recently used
up but I did throw it away so I have my
project use it up I've already mentioned
that and so I threw in the bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks French lavender honey scrub
I finished it up it was not my favorite
did not enjoy it but it is gone and I
didn't want to waste it so that is done
I don't have packaging to show you I'm
sorry but I'm glad it's in the trash and
not with me next number 7 the category
was either wool or copper and for that I
decided to hit pan on a shadow in the
Too Faced peanut butter and jelly now I
wanted to hit pan on peanut brittle
because it's a copper shade I think that
was kind of where I was going
with that I have made a little bit of
progress in this but barely anything
this is not a palette that I reached for
on the everyday I love this palette I
need to get back into it maybe do like a
one month one palette or something but I
did not hit pan on that obviously number
H the category was bronze or pottery and
for that I chose a shade from Coastal
Scents this is a single shadow and if
you guys were with me from the beginning
of the year I actually was doing a pan
that palette and I was trying to hit pan
and everything in my Z palette that was
like my everyday shades and this one was
actually in there I've made like I've
used it this year but I definitely am
nowhere near hitting pan this is the
shade bronze peach from Coastal Scents
but anyway I don't feel the need to hit
paint on this at the moment I'm not
worried about it so another reason this
projects ending the next item I am so
excited about the category for this was
pottery or willow and for that I chose
this laura geller french vanilla baked
highlighter and the reason I chose it is
because the terracotta plate I counted
that as pottery I guess but it's done
guys I cannot believe it this is such a
huge accomplishment for me this year I'm
so happy I really do love this
highlighter I highly suggest it for
anyone who's wanting like a really
natural glow but I am really happy I
finished it it's a huge accomplishment
next was number 10 which was tin or
aluminum and I just chose a metal hair
can this is the big sexy hair root pump
I have finished this this took forever
to finish I use this for years I didn't
use it like you're supposed to like
spraying it straight in the roots
because it just was too much product on
my really thin fine hair but I would use
it and just put it in my hand and then
disperse it that way it worked fine it's
not my favorite I probably wouldn't
purchase it but I definitely didn't hate
it at the end and I didn't have anything
to immediately replace it so I missed it
a little bit right at the end the next
category is steel and for whatever
reason I chose this perfume I don't even
know at this point anymore but I am
finished with it so so happy this is one
of the first things to go I threw it in
a project at the early portion of the
year and just worked on through it this
was the year of using up perfumes for me
I can tell you that this is the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana white and I
don't hate this scent as much as I did
when I was trying to like make myself
use it but it's definitely not a
favorite it's not one that I would spend
a bunch of money on I definitely bought
into the hype when these first launched
and that's why I bought it but I
definitely wouldn't repurchase it I like
so many other scents more than that one
only a few more things left number 12 is
silk and linen and for that I chose the
Moroccan oil treatment because it makes
my hair feel like silk I am finished
with this one I'm onto my second one I
love the Moroccan oil products you guys
know that I talk about them so so much I
love this I love the volume shampoo and
conditioner I love the dry shampoo so
this is just great I love the smell of
Moroccan oil the next item was lace and
for that I chose the benefit rockateur
blush because of the packaging I've been
doing an amazing job this year making
progress on this you can tell that I
have started to kind of like hit the
grid of the pan I don't really know what
the pan on this product looks like so I
think I'm pretty close I don't know if
that's technically me hitting pan or not
so I'm just gonna keep using it this is
one of my favorite just natural everyday
blushes this goes with any
I want to wear it's something I would
definitely bring with me on vacation or
throw in my makeup bag if I just didn't
want to fuss around or if I wanted
something that I know would just be
perfect with everything it's great next
was ivory and I chose an ivory colored
shadow
this is starlet's pearl eyeshadow and
it's gonna look like it's done but
there's the tiniest bit of use in there
like most people would be like it's done
but I have like two or three more uses
on it I use this as a face highlighter
and I think it's beautiful this is
discontinued you can't get the shade any
longer and I wouldn't honestly like go
out and try to find it but I did think
it looked really nice as I used it and I
enjoyed using it up that one to me is
like another huge accomplishment I'm
really happy about that
for number 15 that was Krystal and for
that I chose a duo crumb shadow from
Urban Decay this is the shade tonic and
my goal is to hit pan and as you can see
I did hit pan this is an amazing shadow
I love it so much
there are a lot of dupes for this duper
star from look see black light from
makeup geek you can find a ton I love
that you can put this on its own and
it's just kind of like this soft really
pretty duochrome you can put this on top
of like a darker base and it's really
going to pick up different colors just a
great shadow highly suggested really
pretty the next category was waxed and
for that I chose this nukes lip balm
this is made of beeswax that's why I
have been making amazing progress in
this I do have some pictures you guys
have been seeing them but I'm really
happy with the progress I made on this
this product takes forever to use up
this has been by my bedside table I have
gone off and on using it I wouldn't say
I've used it like every single night of
the entire year but I have used it a
vast majority of the year and it just
takes forever to use up you don't need
that much it really does hydrate the
lips I think I'm at the point where I'm
just kind of tired of it like want
something new and want to try something
new but I do suggest it I think it's
great I don't think it's too expensive
for how long it lasts really the only
complaint that I have about this product
is the fact that the shelf life is only
six months when it takes way longer to
use it up than six months but other than
that I really like it and it's not gone
bad you can tell if something's gone bad
by the smell so I would keep it longer
just would make sure you are sanitary
when you're using it since it's in a pot
we are on to the last item and for that
category it wish shells and I chose two
different hand sanitizers I only have
wanted to show you I don't know where
the other one is I don't know if it's
like in a purse forgot lost if I use it
up and threw it away I don't know where
it is but this one is the coastal surf
and Sun I chose really beachy scents
because of the shell theme but I just
wanted to use two of these up for the
year I have so many of the little
anti-back and as much as I keep them on
me and we use them you just don't need
that much of them and I tend to prefer
to actually wash my hands and if I'm on
set I have like my big hand sanitizer so
it definitely takes me like conscious
you know effort to use these guys up
I would only purchase them like one at a
time honestly and that's everything guys
I want to say thank you so much to
Claire for inviting me to join this
project I do like year like long
projects I think there's something kind
of fun about them and the fact that you
can you know pick some maybe harder
items that you can see progress on
throughout the year I would say overall
this project was a success I'm really
happy that I was able to move so many
things out declutter so many things even
the few items that I wasn't able to make
too much progress on I think it gives me
good insight into those products and how
they work with my collection if I've
been reaching for them or not so I think
all of that is very successful and I
will definitely be doing something like
this in 2018 like a year-long project of
using items up so anyway that is
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
