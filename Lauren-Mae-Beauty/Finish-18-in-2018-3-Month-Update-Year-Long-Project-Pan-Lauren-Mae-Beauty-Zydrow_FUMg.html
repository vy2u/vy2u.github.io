learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing an update on
my finish 18 and 20 18 this is a
year-long project pan and we are heading
towards the end of March so I thought it
would be nice to update you guys let you
guys know where I'm at with some of
these products because 18 is a lot and I
have some progress in some of them which
I'm really excited about just in case
you haven't seen my testing testing 1 2
3 video this is fake and it is raining
outside so I'm really sorry about the
noise but its nature and I cannot
control it and I also am enjoying the
rain but other than that let's just get
into the products and my progress I
think I'm gonna give you guys the most
progress first I don't know we'll just
see how it goes every time I try to like
plan it then it'll just go however it
goes anyway so why try to force things
so the first item I have finished off
here is the Revlon nearly naked powder I
barely had anything left in this
honestly last time I just wanted to
force myself to use it up and I did I
repress this and I do have a video on it
so I'll leave my how I repress makeup
video link down below if you want to
check it out but I'm happy to get this
out of my collection
I enjoyed it it was fine but I do prefer
loose powders another item that I've
technically hit my goal on is the laura
geller bronzer I have three bronzers on
this project and I want to hit pan on
all of them so I have hit pan on this
this is pretty sizable pan and I do
really enjoy this product something that
I hate though now that I've hit pan is
that it kind of is starting to crumble
which is so irritating so I'm going to
keep using it and hopefully I can like
wear it down so it's just slowly wearing
down the sides instead of like crumbling
off product but if that keeps happening
I probably will repress this so it won't
look like I have pan but I have hit pan
on this and I also hit pan on another
bronzer this is hula light and I am so
happy guys to bronzers with pan and them
feels really great
I do wear quite a bit of bronzer I've
been trying to like tone it down so it's
a little bit more subtle but I can go a
little heavy-handed with the bronzer so
I really enjoy this one is it I don't
think it's one I would repurchase but I
do like it I just think there are so
many great ones out there that I want to
either try or I just love the butter
bronzer so you know but I'm really happy
be getting some use out of that product
and be getting my money's worth
the really sizable progress kind of ends
there I had a couple of primers that I
threw in here this one's from Cokie and
it's the smooth glow primer I have this
in my current forgotten love's project
pan that I'm doing as a collab I'll
leave that link down below if you
haven't seen that too but I did kind of
start here and I'm almost down to of the
like line so I mean I'm going I'm happy
with that I forgot this was in the
project I forgot it was in that project
like I just kind of let this one go to
the side and I had so many new primers
but I'm back on it I've been using this
quite frequently and I'm happy to get
more progress on it I think that I
definitely will use this up I'm into the
year it's not gonna be a problem I just
wish I had a little bit more progress to
show you guys and really the last one
with any difference this is the urban
decay illusion I shadow I use this as a
highlighter and I really enjoy it I do
have some expanded pan it's not a ton of
progress but it's definitely something
more this is also in my from love's
project pan I use my like seasonal
project pans as a way to like really
make sure I get these items gone I love
this but I have been testing out other
highlighters so I think this will be
gone by the end of the year and I still
really enjoy it just looks so beautiful
on the skin I really wish this was a
full-size highlighter we could all buy I
think that you guys would like it and I
know that I love it and now I'm just
gonna show you the rest of the things in
this project and my thoughts on them if
I've used them what not so let's go back
to face powders this one is from Sephora
and this is the micro smooth powder in
light I do want to try to use this one
up still again like I said I am more
into loose powders but this one is a
nice like satin finish on the skin I
just need to wait until my skin's a
little darker so I'm for summer I'm
gonna try to use this one huh this is
the gorgeous cosmetics powder and I just
don't really like this it's a little too
dark for me it's a little yellow I'm
trying to use it up because again it's
in that other project pan but it's just
been really difficult and I can see
myself decluttering this most likely and
the other powder that I had in here I
actually did declutter it was the maid
super skin the Maybelline something skin
powder and I just didn't enjoy it it
kind of has the same issues to me as the
gorgeous cosmetics one so I did get rid
of that one and it's been it's been
great I haven't missed it since four
foundations I have the Revlon Colorstay
in here this is in the shade 150 I'm
wearing it today mix with a little bit
of a tinted moisturizer just to kind of
cut it and give it a little bit more
moisture and just make it a little bit
more like of a medium coverage I did
enjoy how it went on today and I have
been trying to mix this other ways I
don't like it on its own it's just a
it's just how my favorite type of finish
I do like something that's a little more
satin even a little bit more dewy medium
coverage that's like the zone I like to
be in so I am gonna find a way to make
this work I think at least at this point
but if it just becomes too tedious and I
don't want to I will be passing this
along and the other foundation that I
had in here was from vivillon this one I
have not touched because again I'm
saving this for summer it's just a
little bit dark for me but I am excited
to use it because I did enjoy this I
like cream foundations I really like
stick cream foundations I like the ones
and the pans I think they're just so
easy to apply with a brush and just
buffing and get a nice like light layer
on the skin so yeah I'm excited to use
this again once I get a little bit more
tan I had two more primers in here this
one's the lorac I'm so sensitive and I
am going to be getting rid of this one
this literally has like two uses in it
and I was looking at it the other day
and it's just I don't think it's
necessarily all the way off but I've had
this for a long time I have it in my kit
and then I took it out of my kit because
I only had a little bit left and it was
just like a waste of space and then it's
been sitting in my collection now
probably at least a year since I did
that so I just feel like it's a little
bit old and it's not worth it so I'm
gonna be getting rid of that one
and then the Mac one I honestly haven't
touched because I've been working on the
cookie or new ones in my collection so I
need to work on this but I probably will
not touch this realistically until the
cookie when it's gone from bronzers I'm
working on the Estee Lauder one now it's
the one I'm wearing today I do really
like this and I think it's perfect
timing because it's tart
become spring and summer and this works
best for me in that time because it's a
little bit darker this also has more of
like a red tone to it and the other ones
are like lighter more neutral maybe a
little bit more yellow toned so I think
this will work really nice in summer and
will look good throughout that time for
me to make the progress on it I did
throw two concealers in here this one is
from Eden minerals and it's a pen I've
used this a couple of times but nothing
notable and also I won't know how much
we have left in this because it's in a
pen form so it'll be like one day it
just runs out and we'll all celebrate
but until then I still have it in here
it's a very lightweight concealer so I
think going into summer hopefully it'll
be nice for that and then the other one
I have is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
waterproof I really like this product
this is in the shade 1c light and it
says it's cool but I think this is very
yellow I'm wearing it today under my
eyes and I think this will work best for
me and summer as well because it's a
little bit yellow and a little bit dark
like I just usually like something a
little bit more highlighting under the
eyes so I think going into summer I can
get a lot of progress on this the
consistency of this product is really
nice too it's super thin it's not too
heavy of coverage which I really enjoy
and it's really nice so I do suggest
this if you were like thinking about it
it's a good one I have two blushes in
here and I just want to hit pan on these
so I don't know it's gonna be a tough
one I definitely have been sticking to
my same blushes but I need to use these
ones just a little bit more in my
collection this is the Eden minerals
blush in half torn I love this I think
it's so pretty I'm excited to use this
one because it's just a peachy nude and
that's my type of style so I'm not
worried I just need to make sure that
these are the ones I'm reaching for when
I don't know what blush to wear and the
other one that I'm talking about here is
the Clinique cheek pop in nude and I'm
making really good progress on it you
cannot see the flower really any more so
I'm really happy about that this one is
a bit more of like a brownie Orange a
nude and this is like a pinky peachy
nude but this one I definitely think I
can get and I should probably focus on
this one since it's closest but we'll
see I still want to enjoy the blushes it
just always feels good to have products
in your collection that look really
loved and more
and the last item here is from Becca and
this is moonstone I don't know why I
don't use this I've used it maybe twice
it's beautiful every time I watch it and
when I did wear it I thought it was
pretty I don't know why I just don't
reach for this thing so I definitely
don't have an opinion on it yet I think
it's pretty but I need to wear it
consecutively and over time and with
different looks for me to really have an
opinion on whether I want to keep this
or if I don't or if I like it or if I
don't or what so yeah that's just a
little update I thought I would let you
guys know how I feel about these
products if there is any significant
progress which there wasn't some I'm
really happy about and hopefully it will
inspire you to just you know find some
items in your collection maybe you can
give a little bit of extra love to this
year so that way you can see some
progress in it it always feels so
amazing to actually use the products
that you buy
I do enjoy buying products it's fun but
there is something so satisfying about
seeing them used and loved
anyway that's everything thank you so so
much for watching guys and I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
