Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought I would start off my
project pans for 2018 and share with you
guys the 18 items that I want to use up
this year this is a year-long project so
the items that I chose for this are
going to be more long-term items things
that I want to use up by the end of the
year want out of my collection haven't
used in a while and want to try and see
if I want them my focus for this wasn't
to pick different items in different
categories I literally just wanted to
use up these specific items so a lot of
categories have multiple items and then
some have nothing but that's intentional
so yeah we'll just stop talking about it
it's pretty self-explanatory
we'll start with like base products so
I'll start with powders so I have four
face powders that I want to use up it's
kind of a lot so we'll talk about the
one you guys all know and love and I've
seen in a ton of videos this is my
Revlon nearly naked powder and it
doesn't have a lot in it but I am going
to repress it I know I'm the liar and
I'm actually gonna do it I think I might
film it because a couple of people have
wondered how I repress my powder so I'm
gonna do that for you guys but it's
gonna be probably really crappy like
vlogging video I don't know how good the
footage is gonna look but I will try to
do that for you guys that one should be
pretty easy to use up I'm not worried
about it the next one here is from
gorgeous cosmetics this is the shade
number zero three and if I'm not
mistaken yeah I have already hit pan on
this powder so I want to use this up
it's a nice powder it's been a long time
since I've used this I got this when I
was working at a beauty store and that
hasn't been for a while so I know this
product is kind of holds and I want to
use it up and get use out of it I go
through a lot of powders when I was
going through my makeup empties for the
year that's still something that I use a
lot of so I know I can go through it and
I want to try to just move it out of my
collection and not let it go to waste
another powder this one is from Sephora
and this is the micro smooth powder in
light I believe they have a fair shade
now but when I had purchased this this
was the lightest shade my cap has
obviously fallen off it seen better days
this is a little bit dark for me so I
want to use this up in the summertime
and that's what I'm going to focus in on
this product it's beautiful on the skin
if you really love a matte finish you
might not like these I would say this is
probably very similar to the
Mack skinfinish whatever you know I'm
talking about I've never even used that
but pretty sure they have a similar
finish on the skin it's a nice like
satin finish and it's just really pretty
and the last one is from Maybelline this
is the better skin powder and that's
what it looks like I haven't hit pan or
anything there is a bit of a dent going
this I don't know I just feel like it's
a little yellow I almost think this
looks dark when I look at it but I guess
it's not when I hold it up to my face so
I want to get through that powder as
well I just I always reach for my loose
powders and so I really want to focus in
on using these up because all of these
are a bit older in my collection and I
don't gravitate to them naturally so I'm
hoping this project will either give me
a push to use them or help me realize
that I can let them go and I didn't
mention it but if I'm using these
products and I don't like them they
don't work for me I'm just not having a
fun time I will be declutter amande to
me that counts as like using it up or
like that's like a success because I
just I don't know I just don't have time
to pan things that I absolutely hate I
love the satisfaction of using up makeup
products but if I really hate it I'm not
going to bother I have two foundations
that I threw in here the first one is
the Revlon Colorstay foundation this one
is for combination oiling and it's in
the shade 150 I've had this for about a
year now and I haven't used it in that
whole time so I just wanted like try
this out see if it's something that I
like or can make work for me if not then
I will be passing it on but if I do like
it I'd like to use it up and the next
one here is the vivillon cream
foundation this is something that's a
little bit dark for me so I have to use
it in summer but I do really like it
it's so easy to just stick my brush in
here put it on my face I really like it
for that it has like a nice coverage it
looks good on the skin so I would like
to use this up during summer this year I
have three primer products to use this
one is the cokie smooth glow hydrating
foundation primer i actually really like
this it's not overly dewy it's
definitely not as moisturizing as say
the first aid beauty coconut smoothie
primer which i really like but it's a
nice middle ground it doesn't have a
silicone feel to it which I really enjoy
I used to really like those but now I
just find that they dry my skin out even
though I get oily I feel like they can
just emphasize some dry patches if it's
like a thicker silicone I don't know so
anyway I like this one I want to use it
and I have a good dent going in it the
next one is the oil control lotion from
Mac I have this in my kit for a little
bit but I found that it was like pilling
up and I'm not sure what other product I
was using to make it do that but I just
did not have time for that in my kit for
like things to be pilling and like going
awry
alright I don't know you know what I'm
trying to say so this has like a really
nice scent it's kind of like manly I
don't know I want to use this up though
it's just the small size and last is
this primer from lorac it's the I'm so
sensitive smoothing face primer I had
this in my kit but it's like on its last
legs so I took it out so I didn't like
run out of it or anything and so I just
want to get the last couple of uses out
of it this one should be an easy one
last for like base products I have two
concealers this one is from Eden
minerals and it's just a pen style
concealer I do really like it we will
not be able to tell how far I am on this
product because it's in this clicky pen
but this is something that's really
hydrating under the eyes I enjoy it and
I think it'll be nice to use this up
during winter so that's what I'm gonna
focus on it and hopefully I can get it
done before we get into summer and then
the other concealer that I'm throwing in
is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
waterproof this is something that I have
a love-hate relationship with sometimes
I really like it sometimes I don't I
don't hate it but I don't love it so I
want to use this up I've used quite a
bit of this product because it was what
I brought to Arizona with me and I was
out of some of my favorites so I do want
to use this I do enjoy it I just I want
to use it up I just love my two
drugstore concealers more than that so
yeah I know that I'll choose those
always over it but it's still good and I
want to use it and then the rest of the
products are either blushes bronzers or
highlighters and not all of these do I
actually want to use up all the way I'm
okay with color products to just hit pan
it's so hard to use up color products
you have like if you wanted to use a
blush up you honestly could probably use
it if it's a full-size blush that's like
you know moderately pigmented it would
take you almost a year I mean it takes a
long time and I love makeup I love
trying new things so I can just get some
decent wear and my products to me that's
getting my money's worth out of it so
we'll start with bronzer because that's
how I apply it I have three of those the
first one is from Estee Lauder it's the
bronze
goddess I love all of these bronzers in
here so it shouldn't be hard I actually
use a lot of bronzer as well so it
shouldn't be too bad this one I want to
hit pan on it's a huge pan there's a lot
of product in here and this one is what
I'm gonna say for summer more than
anything I do use it now but I think
that I will love it the most in summer
and I can work on the other ones now in
winter the second bronzer I want to work
on is the hoola light if you guys have
been reading the description boxes of my
makeup you guys know that I have been
using this a lot I brought it with me to
Arizona and just was enjoying it there I
have a bit of a dent I can see the dent
in it so hopefully this one won't take
too long to use up I think that I'm just
like a beast when it comes to bronzer we
all know I love to like you know get in
there on my hairline and try to make it
not look some sparse so yeah and then
the last bronzer is one from laura
geller this is the baked impressions
bronzer and it's in the shade light this
is Mac it's the lightest one out of all
of them I really like it cuz it's just a
nice tone it's not too orange E it's not
too gray toned I'm wearing it today as
my bronzer and I really like it so this
is the one I will probably start using
the most and try to make that pan first
for blushes I did choose to which i
think is a bit of a stretch but we'll
see how it goes I did hit pan on the
rocket or blush that I wanted to do last
year I was able to do that and I'm so
happy I really loved that blush too so
hopefully I can hit pan on two blushes
this year the first one is from Clinique
this is the nude pop blush I have a lot
of wear on this already so hopefully I
can hit pan on this the Daisy girly or
Stefanie has panned one of these before
and she gives me hope that I can do it
too so fingers crossed and then the
other one I want to do is from Eden
minerals and this one's so pretty it's
what I'm wearing today
it's just a nice peachy you know nude
blush the kind of blushes I like I
realized that I'm not that adventurous
when it comes to blush like sometimes
I'll do something really like out there
or more editorial but on the everyday
that's not what I normally do I love
nudes and peaches more than most part
those are like my favorite maybe like a
rosy nude who getting crazy those are
just what I like
so I don't know I've decluttered so many
of my blushes if you go to like my first
declutter video ever you can see how
many blushes I have and I probably have
a 4th of those left alright I believe
we're down to the last two items in both
of these are highlighters so the first
one here is from Becca and this is in
the shade of moonstone you probably
didn't even know I had this because I
never busted out mine is cracked a bitch
so I want to be careful with it but I do
want to hit pan and really the reason
I'm throwing this in here is because I
don't use this very often and so I'm
going to use this project as a way to
force myself to use it and see if it's
something I want to keep in my
collection or if it's something I can
pass on so that's something I want to
hit pan on and then this last one here
is my Urban Decay eyeshadow and illusion
which I use as a highlighter Michael was
hit pan on this in my last project and I
did it so this year I want to use it all
up I want to finish it off and get it
out of my collection it's an older item
I love it it's beautiful but I will be
so happy when this has gone this year I
definitely think I can do it I think
hitting pan was one of the hardest
things and now I think it'll go pretty
fast since I can see the pan expanding
alright those are my 18 items I'm really
excited for this I do think I'm gonna do
some seasonal projects I also want to do
a perfume project with all my perfume
samples so a video like that might be
coming soon anyway I think that's it for
now thank you so so much for watching
guys and I will see you in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
