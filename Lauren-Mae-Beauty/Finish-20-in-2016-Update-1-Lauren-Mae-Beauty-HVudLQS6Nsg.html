is going to be an update on the 20 items
I want to finish up in 2016 now I
believe in my intro video I've only had
one video my intro so I'll leave that
link down below but I believe I wanted
to get rid of these items if I didn't
finish them up this year these are all
older items in my collection and things
that I feel like if I truly loved them I
would have already used them by now and
so I'm giving myself a year to kind of
test it out see if I like I'm using them
up if I can and if not it's just time
for them to go and if I'm not gonna use
them up after this project then they're
like I'm definitely not gonna use them
up ever I'm gonna start off with the
items I've already finished up I have
used up quite a few of these items
because they were in project pans I'm
really happy with how many things I've
used up so far and things in here that
are a little bit harder first thing
we'll just start off with my bronzer
this is from Bourjois and it's a
bronzing primer so it's a cream product
it is completely used up this was in my
finished 5 by Cinco DeMayo I'll leave
that finale video well I'll leave that
links down below
I guess my intro I don't know I'm really
happy I use this and I do enjoy this
product if I found this somewhere for
cheap or somehow was making an order off
of somewhere with that sold this I
probably would buy another one I liked
it that much I have two eyeliners in
here from Stila and I've used both of
these up they are completely gone you
can't screw him up anymore I've used up
all five now that I've had since I
started my channel I'm so happy I
haven't bought an eyeliner in a really
long time which feels good and I'm just
trying to work through using up the ones
I have because I have so many another
eyeliner I used up this one's from chart
this is the emphasized aqua gel eyeliner
it's just in a brown color doesn't have
a color name on it it was very creamy
and wet feeling which I didn't really
like because I used all these to
tightline with because I don't normally
wear like eyeliner really it was okay I
would never purchase this I wouldn't
suggest it I'm just glad I worked
through it this is an item you guys
haven't seen finished but I am done with
it this is the Tarte CC primer and fair
I did enjoy this product and it was in
my finished 7th eye spring I think but
it is completely flush with my hand I'm
not gonna dig in there but I can't like
apply the product to my face anymore
I like the Stila CC sticks as well but
those are just continued to I don't know
why no one purchases them because I love
using that
on clients for that really like no
makeup makeup look especially on guys
when I'm just doing like natural
grooming with guys so I did enjoy this
product I wouldn't repurchase it I don't
think you can yeah I got through that
one that was like a big one I finished
out the both of the bare minerals
powders that I had in here these are
both in fairly light I don't know if
this is the big size I got these on an
outlet where you were like buy two get
one free or something so I also have
like the mineral veil I did enjoy them
but I did get oily pretty fast they're
the original foundation not the matte
one I think it'll just try other powder
foundations but I potentially could see
myself going back to these in the future
though I do think bare minerals has a
really good product I think this is the
last thing that I finished up from this
project this is the Revlon Colorstay
whipped 24-hour foundation and this is
in the color ivory it's completely gone
I started off not really liking this
product and now I not miss it but I did
enjoy it at the end and I think it gave
a really nice finish especially when I
mixed it with my BB cream to kind of
give this a little bit of a darker color
because this was too fair for me and
then also to just kind of cut the
texture of it cuz it's very very thick
but I did enjoy the last bits of this
and I kind of just miss the finish I got
with this but I will never purchase it
now we'll get into the rest of the items
this is the Stila prime color one-step
primer and kitten I've been using this
all over my face it literally had like
two uses left I started up here I
believe or one of those and use this all
the way up this was in my finish five
five Cinco de Mayo I'm not completely
done though I mean like seriously five
uses I have to like seriously squeeze
this so hard to get anything out so this
will be in an empties video soon I
wanted to use up another foundation this
year because this is another one that I
bought because it's like matte and
Revlon and I really like Revlon products
it started off full so I have used up
quite a bit of it we're about here now I
have been using this I don't really like
this product I feel like it sits on the
skin it doesn't really go into the skin
been using it in a similar way to the
Revlon Colorstay whipped one with mixing
it with that BB cream and it's helped
and I'm gonna try really hard to finish
it but I've not been happy with how my
face like base foundation has been
looking and it's a mix between the
foundation and also not having the right
colored powders and powders that keep me
matte so I will continue to try to use
this throughout the year but again if I
don't finish it throughout the year I'm
just gonna get rid of it I don't suggest
the soak don't buy it please don't buy
it especially if you're oily I don't
feel like this controls my oil I don't
think that it's like it says that it is
lightweight it's not lightweight it's so
heavy you feel like you're running so
much makeup and again it just sits on
top of everybody just hate it I really
don't like this this is the Becca ever
matte poreless priming Perfector I
really only use this a couple times
since I threw this in here at the
beginning of the year I am gonna be
working on it soon I think throughout
the summer maybe I'll try to use it up I
don't like this primer personally I
don't think it keeps me mad I don't like
the feeling on the skin it feels like
good when you first put it on but I just
feel like throughout the day as I do
produce oil I don't like the way it
feels so I'm gonna use this up but I
would not purchase it and for me it just
didn't work this is a powder I haven't
even started yet this is the maybelline
powder and 220 I don't like this powder
all over the face necessarily because it
does get quite oily so if you have dry
skin this would be a good powder I want
to use this under my eyes but I need to
get more of a tan so hopefully soon I'll
be starting to use this powder as summer
hits and I get more tan maybe hopefully
and I can use this under my eyes as a
setting powder or just the kind of on
like areas where I don't get oily I have
quite a few eyeliners in here so we'll
just get those done this is the Smashbox
limitless eyeliner it's just in black
I've used this a couple times I don't
really like this eyeliner because it
doesn't stay in the waterline I find
that I end up having like gunk up here
gunk here and that usually happens but
not that fast like this is like a couple
hours so I wish it didn't do that I'm
gonna still try to use it up though this
is a pencil from Sephora this is like a
black glitter liner but it is a pencil
it has that much product left I don't
think I've used it much I'm gonna try to
use on my tight line although it has
glitter in it so I'm not sure how
successful that'll be if all like you
know and
having well I don't want to be the girl
that had glitter in her eye and got her
I replace right has everyone heard that
story who even knows if that's true
that's like an urban legend at this
point I feel like but anyway I was ready
to use that up we'll see how it goes if
I absolutely hate that one I'm probably
just gonna declutter it because I've had
it so long it's just not worth my time
but we'll see
and then last for eyeliners this is the
mary kay liner and bronze I do like this
liner and this is the liner I have been
using to tightline with so as you can
see that's all I have left if you look
at my intro video which will be linked
down below you can tell that I've used
so much of this because this used to be
like at least this long and this is a
hard pencil this is not like the Stila
ones it has not been easy to get through
so I definitely think I'll be finishing
that within the next like week and a
half hopefully hopefully and that would
be another rundown I threw in to cream
shadows from benefit these are actually
discontinued and these are in like the
old discontinued packaging like they
came out these they change the packaging
and then now they've discontinued them
in that packaging so these are old this
is top brass this one still feels really
creaming is really nice I've used this a
couple times you can't really see any
progress when I first got these I used
cream shadows all the time it's all I
would wear and now it's not the case so
I'm just going to use these as much as I
can maybe hit pan or something but I'm
not gonna worry about it as much and
then once the end of the year comes I'm
just going to throw them out the other
color I had here is sipping and dippin I
use this as a base today on my eyes
because I really like this peachy gold
color and then I put makeup geek might I
think it is the duochrome one over it
looks really pretty this one is a lot
drier this one is not as silky and
creamy so I don't know how much more use
I'm gonna be able to get out of this
before I have to get rid of it
I believe I only have two items left
this is the mini high-beam from benefit
I want to use this up because I've had
this a long time I do like this product
I just don't like that it's a liquid I
just get such a pretty color I love that
pinky like shimmery kind of highlight so
hopefully I can get some use out of this
I like using these products like before
i powder my whole face and I feel like
you can definitely use more of it that
way too so I don't think this will be a
problem I just really haven't started
using it yet this year and the last item
this is another benefit product while
lots of benefit at the end here this is
dr. feelgood
and this is a like mattifying bomb type
things I bought this because I wanted to
try it so long ago and I've never tried
it I want to finish a couple other
things before I get into this but I
should just start working on this
because it needs to get done so we'll
see maybe in my project pan roulette
I'll pick something that this can fit
into and I might put it in there that's
the progress on my 20 items I want to
use that by 2016 by the end of 2016 I
feel like for not being quite halfway
through the year I've made a lot of
progress I've used about half the
products which i think is great and I've
used so many items up this year on top
of these so I definitely think that I'm
going to get through a lot more of these
and the others that I don't again I'm
just I'm realizing I don't need them in
my life and this is a really good way
for me to kind of force myself to part
with some things if I don't use them I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
and I will see you in my next video bye
