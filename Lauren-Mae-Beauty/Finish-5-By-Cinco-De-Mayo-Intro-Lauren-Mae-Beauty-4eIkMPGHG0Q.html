five by Cinco de Mayo video today for
you guys I'm super excited to show you
guys the items I want to use up I feel
like these ones are not look super hard
but not super easy either so I'm really
really excited to use them up and just
see how far I can go with them they're
all make up most of the items that are
gonna be in these pants are going to be
makeup because that's what i want to use
up the most like that's what i have a
ton of so let's just get straight into
the video so one of the first things i
want to use up is another it's a face
product this is the physicians formula
organic wear tinted moisturizer in the
shade light to natural this tinted
moisturizer I've had for a super long
time I just again want to use it up I
have quite a few foundations when i did
my inventory i'm not even a foundation
girl and i was surprised to know how
many of those i have so i just want to
work through this i'm using this in
conjunction with the foundation and my
other in my finished 7 by spring I'm not
worried i definitely think i can finish
this up by the fifth of may i will be
super happy when this is gone this has
kind of a I don't know it's not like
early but I also smell like a chemical
which i think is so weird since its
physicians formula I don't know how far
up this is there's a lot of air inside
so um in the products so running that I
can't like push out the air without
pushing out the product I'm just gonna
kind of see see as it goes and maybe
when I get closer I can maybe push it
down we'll just see how this goes i
can't really market so this one is a
mini tart cheek stain I feel like this
is kind of ambitious to put this in here
but this has let's see that much product
I've only used this once today when I
got ready so that much product to use up
I've had this for a really long time in
my collection this isn't the color flush
let me see if I can do a swatch for you
guys this is a heavy swatch I am going
to be using this underneath my like
powder so I'm going to do like my
foundation
and then my concealer and then I'm going
to put this on and then powder my face
and I can still use a powder blush so
that's the way I'm going to try to work
through this someone use it every single
day and just see how far I can go i
really want to use it all up I don't
know if it's too much or too little or
or where it's gonna fall in the spectrum
of like the time I have to finish it but
it would be so good i would feel so good
if this was gone on my collection um
it's just one of those products you get
and you're like how could I ever use it
up and so tees it up even though it's
mini would still feel amazing so
definitely pumped to get this one out
another chart thing I swear like tart I
just want to some of the stuff is old so
another chart item is a start emphasize
Amazonian clay waterproof cream
eyeshadow this is in the color
shimmering golden beige this is a
smaller size i got like a set of five or
for them um once but i do have quite a
bit of a dent going on in there so i've
been using this already kind of like
every day just because i knew i wanted
to get rid of it before it dried up I
think that I can get through this
product I use it every day as a primer
underneath my shadows so um yeah
sometimes I even double layer it and
I'll wear it on its own I'm excited
again this one I feel like it's like a
good product to get through it's not
like a dinky one it's like you go girl
you know so I want to get through that
one another item this one is kind of a
mini size this is the Elizabeth matzah
the shadow in the color pearl it is see
it there it's quite um opaque this i was
thinking of just using on my inner
corner so that's all i'm going to use it
for i think i can get through this it is
quite crumply i sharpened it only once
in it like fell out and so then I had a
sharp knife again so hopefully i don't
use like lose product from it that way
but i got this in like an Ipsy bag so
it's not like I paid for it you know
even though i did but you know i'd love
to get through this guy and its really
Corner it has great staying power if I
had to I can use it on my inner like
water line as well so I think that'll be
good and it's another liner out of the
way the last item my fifth item that I
want to use up by May fifth is it this
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer this
is the original one it's not the milk
chocolate I have had this for a while
and i have another like another small
size of it because i got like this kit
so i don't want to work through this
since i have like another one on standby
I want to work through this guy I have
you know i wouldn't say made a dent in
it but i was using it for a while before
so hopefully this one i can actually
make it through i'm excited to use this
one up and then like to tell you the
price i guess the price on this one when
i went through the best price i could
get is seven dollars and fifty Cent
value on this one for the Elizabeth mot
shadow the price I could get was seven
dollars and 49 cents the original size
of the big size is fifteen dollars so or
1499 so this was about half size it
doesn't have any houses or anything on
it so I just did my best guesstimate
guesstimate guess I did my best guess
this I don't know if I said this one
this is 1195 off a physician's formula
website um so yeah I'd love to use that
the tart emphasized I shadow on the best
I could get was $11 they're selling
their full price ones on line on the
chart website on sale for 11 and this is
a mini size so I don't know that's just
what I did so $11 value of that and then
for the mini guy tart cells like the
mini to go ones for ten dollars they
don't do them in every shade but that's
what I put this one at two so in total i
do have a total here that would be forty
seven dollars and ninety four cents
worth of product out of my collections
by the fifth of may which is super
exciting i'm really excited for this one
just because it does have some harder
items in there also super accomplished
when i get those ones done and yeah let
me know if you guys are doing this or if
you have make videos i want to see your
guys's i like look these up like that's
what I
in the search bar and then I'll just
like watch tons of them so yeah I'd love
to get to know you guys and see what you
guys are using up and kind of support
you on that so I will see you guys in my
next video have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
