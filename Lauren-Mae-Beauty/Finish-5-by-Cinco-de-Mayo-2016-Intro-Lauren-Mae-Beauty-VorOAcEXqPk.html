Lauren thanks so much for tuning in we
are starting another project today so
this is going to be my intro for the
finish 5 by Cinco de Mayo obviously that
means I want to use all these all these
five products but I want to use these
by-products up by the fifth of me so
let's get into them I did pick kind of
bigger ones may fit seems pretty far off
to me so I thought I would kind of try
to challenge myself with some of the
items i picked so let's get into what I
chose the first item I picked is an
eyeshadow in the Smashbox blue eyes
palette I am wanting to hit sizable pan
on the lightest shade in the Smoky trio
so it's very similar to orange soda by
anastasiya but not as good but I'm going
to be using that in my crease and I just
think it'll be an easy one to hit pan on
and to be able to use every day without
confining myself to a certain look so
I'd like to hit quite a bit of pan on
that shadow i also want to use up this
Stila one step prime color and kitten I
want to use this as a primer on the face
I think that's going to be the easiest
way to get more product done faster so
I'm hoping this will give me kind of
that luminous look we'll see how that
works out for me I am starting on this
black line here and the rest of the tube
is full so I definitely think that if I
work on this I can definitely finish it
up by the faith of mine I have a
foundation item I want to finish up this
is the Revlon Colorstay whipped and I
don't have a ton left of this but this
is one that I have to mix with other
foundations I don't like just using this
on its own it's quite thick so although
this isn't a full product it's still
going to take a little bit to actually
use it all the way up this is the
bourgeois bronzing primer I'm just using
this as a cream bronzer to kind of
contour my face I would love to use it
up I'm not sure if I'm going to be able
to like entirely use this product up but
I do want to use as much as I possibly
can on this this is an item I want to
finish up in 2016 as well as a couple
other items in this project so I thought
I'd just get like a head start and you
know get like a good boost of energy
toward the beginning half of the year
with this project I'm
just kind of work my way down this
because it's kind of hard to mark where
I'm at and we'll see how how i'm using
this up as we go and the last item this
one isn't actually a challenge um it's
just my lip gloss and it's not a lot of
product but I guess it is a challenge
for me to use up because I'm so bad
using lip products so I just want to
finish this up entirely like remove the
strap or use every last bit of it I
would like to do that by the fifth ma I
think giving myself that much time
although most people probably could
finish it up way faster I think I'll
just be able to actually be successful
in that amount of time that's it those
are my five items I hope you're having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
