is going to be my finished by by Cinco
de Mayo finale video so these are the
five products that i have been using
from probably the past like three months
now for a long time i'm going to show
you guys where I'm out with them and if
I finish anything or whatnot and give
you guys just kind of like my final
thoughts on the project and everything
so sadly I mean I know I try to keep you
in suspense I didn't finish anything in
this project I still feel really happy
with the progress i made i picked all
makeup items for this project and i also
picked things that we're going to be
kind of tough to do i was hoping that if
I really pushed hard I could get these
items done but a lot of things changed
in my life once I moved out here to
California going to makeup school I
can't wear I done like I you know we're
not supposed to wear makeup or we're
just going to take it off so I didn't
wear makeup to school as well as just
different things like the last probably
now like almost a month or so I've been
going on interviews and I just needed
products that are tried and true and are
going to stay on my face better and like
I want to make the best appearance for
myself that I possibly can so if that
meant for going using these items I
would do that it was like worth it to me
to feel confident and how I look then to
try to use up these products so let me
go on with the products and where I'm at
the first thing here is the Physicians
Formula organic wear tinted moisturizer
in light to natural I made consistent
progress so this is the line of where
I'm at I'm so close to being done with
this item and I'm really proud of using
that much product and that is actually
where I'm at I got a flashlight and was
in the dark and like figure it out that
is how much product that product I have
left I'm really happy with the progress
I made on this it's very consistent even
more so really at the end there so I
feel really good about that I'm glad
that this item is almost done I will
update you guys in my empties videos
once i finish products that um maybe I
didn't finish in like a project pan
video or in a seasonal challenge or
whatever so that's what I'm at and I'm
just going to continue to use it the way
it was I was mixing this
with the foundation and that is
partially the reason why I didn't get
the chance to completely finish it up
because I can't just wear this item on
its own so definitely has to be mixed
with other things and the reason I
couldn't use this all the time was I
just didn't want to be greasy throughout
the day if I was going to go on an
interview or had a long day and this
tends to make me look a little greasy
especially if I don't have the ability
to like touch it up so anyway enough
about this this is not finished but
that's how far i got another item I'm
super proud of this is the too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer and I've hit
quite a bit of pan on here I'll do some
close-ups I've had quite a bit of pan on
this guy and I don't know i wish i had
finished it but i also was finding
myself running into problems like I
didn't want to just use this really
heavily just to get through it so I'm
going to again just continue using this
item and you will see the progress on it
in my empties i am going to repress this
powder as well just because it's hard to
get my brush in there and get even
application i do like this bronzer I
think it's really good I like the color
of it I find right now for whatever
reason it's not blending very well on my
skin I don't know if it's the product
itself or if it's the other products I'm
using all my face for my base foundation
or the powder that I'm using to set that
or there's so many factors but I'm kind
of doing my own thing to figure out how
to use this in conduction with other
products but that's where I got on this
product so this is the tart cream
eyeshadow and shimmering golden beige
now this one was again a love-hate
relationship type of item i just i
thought i was going to finish this I
really did i I don't I don't know how I
didn't there's I mean it doesn't seem
like there's that much product in this
little thing but it really was I did end
up pushing you can see in there the
product down to the side so that way I
could not get it under my fingernails
that kept happening I have made some
decent progress since the last time i
use it i use this everyday as an
eyeshadow base and also like primer but
I'm just checking through it i am going
to again the
using this continue using this and
hopefully get this done really soon the
lid is cracked that's kind of like
another reason I want to use it up
because I don't want it to dry out and I
you know this gold color just kind of
got on my nerves I wish I just had a
regular primer instead of ensuring one
because it doesn't always go with every
look but I'm going to work past it at
least it's neutral rate and I really
want to finish this up hopefully
sometime in the near future but I'm just
gonna keep working on this one and
hopefully finish that up relatively soon
I even tried using this with the brush
and I didn't like the way it applied it
didn't give an opaque layer or even like
a semi-opaque later it was really it
didn't work because I was hoping maybe
the brush would help me use it faster no
so I'm just easing my fingers with this
and I'm just keeping keeping on going
there's two more products and again
nothing's finished I feel like such a
failure although i still feel happy
about what i use it just sucks to not
finish anything like that's the whole
point of this well the whole point i
guess is to actually like use up things
you wouldn't have used up the fact that
i've even participated in a science has
hit the goal of using an item i wouldn't
but it sucks to not finish something it
does let's be real um anyway this is the
tart flushed cheek stain and i am really
proud of the progress i made on this but
really I feel like at the same time
almost nothing happened we're at the
same point almost and i have been using
this I can't even mark it again on the
cap it's like about the same place on
the lid so it's it's a pretty color I do
find that once I put this on it I put
this on kind of heavy and I think that's
the reason some days out for wearing
this because I put it on kind of heavy
and I didn't want it to get grecia
throughout the day or something I just
didn't trust it I haven't like taken
note to how this where's but I do put on
quite a bit of this product like all
over my cheeks and I blend it out with
the Beauty Blender and i will tell you
you can almost see no color on my cheeks
and it could be because of the Beauty
Blender it just takes off a lot of that
product in the color someone's watching
a film I don't know I wish I got through
more
this I'm glad I put this in the project
even though I didn't finish it just
because I've had this for such a long
time and I know that if I didn't stick
it in here I probably wouldn't have used
it at all so even like I feel like it's
like halfway done and I feel really good
about that so there is that item I am
gonna keep using this I'm going to put
it in my makeup basket but I'm not going
to like force force myself to use it i'm
going to try to use it probably like
three to four times a week but i want a
little bit of a break from it at least
for a little bit so um I just over it
and the projects over I'm ready to like
just kind of like let it go for a second
and then come back to it so the last
item is this Elizabeth mock cream shadow
in the color pearl I use this just on
the inner tear duct of my eye and I kind
of brought it down like halfway down the
lash line um I really didn't like this
at first and now it's kind of growing on
me I've been doing more simple eye looks
where there isn't a ton of sparkle and
then I'll put this on the inner corner
and I really liked that look with a
really bright lip like neutralize this
to give a little bit of sparkle of
brightness to the eyes and then a really
bold like fun lip it looks really pretty
so I'm glad that I'm back to like
enjoying this product again because I
there will you know for a part of the
project I was just over it um I will say
I don't like the formula of this I think
it's really long lasting but at the same
time applying this product I just don't
think it goes on very smoothly and so
when you're using it on like my inner
corner if I go over an area and then
back over that area it could tend to
make that look patchy instead of like
opaque so I am going to keep using this
probably the same way probably every day
like I happen and hopefully i will get
through that those are my items guys um
again nothing was used up in this
project but I am proud of myself for
picking all makeup items because I know
that is probably make up items are so
hard to use up like we all see empties
and how often do we have makeup items
actually in those empties so I'm glad
that I chose Adams I did even though I
didn't use them up and I am proud of the
progress
did made a lot of these items are really
close to being used up or if not I can
see the progress that I made which is
exciting in and of itself so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video definitely let
me know if you guys have finale video so
i can go check you out and congratulate
you it's over i will probably be doing
the finish for by fourth of july i
haven't started that one you had i'm
thinking about doing it I don't know I
have a lot of projects going on so I
might wait and tell my other projects
over at the end of May and then do it
after that but anyway I will see you
guys in my next video I'm gonna film a
couple today because i had my first day
of work today and oh it wasn't a long
day we just did paperwork but I'm
nervous about filming so I want to get
as much filmed as I can on the days that
i can so that way i can still be talking
to you guys and uploading on my channel

outro I'll see you in my next video I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
