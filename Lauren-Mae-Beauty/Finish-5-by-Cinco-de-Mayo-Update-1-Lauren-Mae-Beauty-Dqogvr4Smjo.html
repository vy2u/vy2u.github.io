Lauren this is going to be yet another
update for a different project I'm
working on this is my finish five by
Cinco de Mayo these are items in my
collection that are a little bit bigger
a little bit harder and since this is a
longer project I thought I could really
tackle them in this project so I haven't
finished anything but I do feel like I'm
making some decent progress and some
items and other items i'm not worried
about quite yet because we're still a
little bit out and i'm finishing up some
other things in different projects and
just in my collections so let me get
into the update i technically have
finished one thing this is my Smashbox
blue eyes palette and i was trying to
hit pan in the shade custard and i have
hit pan so i'm going to continue to make
this pan a little bit larger it's kind
of small especially since i use such a
big fluffy brush with it so i'm going to
work on this one even more so still and
then once it's a little bit bigger I'll
probably just end it because I don't
really like the shadow anyway but I'm so
happy to see some progress and that one
actually see pan I hit panel not today
if you guys saw my Instagram you already
know this sorry for the spoiler I was
just so happy to hit pan on so many
items this morning the next item I
probably have the best progress in is my
bourgeois bronzing primer I really enjoy
this product and if you can remember in
my last update I was all the way at the
top so I have cleaned out quite a bit of
product I'm just kind of moving my
weight down there's a little bit in the
cap what I do is I put my brush in here
and then I'll put it in the cap and then
you know Dom it around my face where I
want my like I use this as like a cream
contouring type of product although it
is kind of warm and I've really been
enjoying it i think that the formulation
of this product is amazing if you're
looking for cream bronzer / contour I
really do like this I think it's a great
product so I'm enjoying using that and I
think that if I continued up with the
progress I've been making that i'll
definitely finish this by some go to
Maya which is crazy this is my steal a
one-step primer in kitten I am I was up
here at this line and now I'm down here
not a ton of progress i am using this on
my entire face but i'm not using it
every single day and that's why there
isn't as much progress as there could be
i decided today to use this one and just
my clinique primer so use this on the
bottom and then use this but i do feel
like it emphasized my pores because it
is shimmery so i will not be doing that
again
anything i'll be using three primers
which is kind of psycho but it doesn't
make me feel any heavier I do like the
look of it it's just more like I'm lazy
and don't want to put on three freaking
primers but i think i will go back to
that method just because i want to use
this up once it's gone it won't have to
do that anymore i do enjoy this product
but i definitely wouldn't repurchase it
I'm just glad I'm not hating it as i'm
using it up because that would suck I
think if I really buckle down and use
this product every day I can finish it
the next two items in the last two items
are ones that I don't really feel like I
have a ton of progress on and I'm going
to try to make it a point to really use
although it has been kind of difficult
this is the Revlon Colorstay whipped
foundation I did kind of use a spatula
and push it all down just to Tennessee
how thick and how much farther into the
container I had it doesn't look like a
ton of product in here but again I do
use this in conjunction with other
foundations I don't like using it on its
own i don't really like how thick the
texture is so because of that it's like
i'm not using a full applications worth
every single time I'm using like half an
applications worth so it doubles the
length of this product I'm just gonna
keep working on it I also though I'm not
going to like be crazy about using this
if I really don't want to on a day I'm
just not going to I've been just liking
powders and this is like the exact
opposite of a powder foundation this is
like a heavy sticky whipped foundation
that never says it's always sticky and
it's just heavy it's a heavy product and
in California it's really hot so it's
already like 80 in the daytime and which
is beautiful but like for a really heavy
face of foundation that can kind of be
irritating as well so I'm gonna do my
best and keep working on it but it's
this one's going to be a struggle which
is funny because I don't think that i
thought when i put this end it would be
the biggest one but it kind of is
turning out that way last item this is
my marvelous Moxie lipgloss from bare
minerals in the color rebel i had this
in a different project this last year in
2015 so I am only like I only have half
of the product left I haven't really
used this much maybe twice so there is
no new progress for you I'm really
focusing on the tarte lipsurgence and
although i can wear them together i do
like the look of the lipsurgence since
it's mad I like keeping it that Matt
look instead of adding a
I feel like once my seven by spring
project ends I will be able to get more
progress out of this product so I'm kind
of just hanging out until then I'm not
really worried about it I think if I
really put the work in for this I could
finish it in like a month so that's
everything i love these short updates
they're so nice I hope you guys enjoyed
this update and this video I will see
you in my next one I'm gonna link down
other people who are doing this project
I know that lady started this project
and there's a ton of others too so if I
can anyone I'm subscribe to or that I've
been seeing and watched i will link that
down below also you can always let
people know in the comments so that way
everyone can kind of support each other
and check it out but is everything I'm
so out of breath in these videos so I'm
really sorry if that comes across but
