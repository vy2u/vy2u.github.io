doesn't make any sense to me hi guys
welcome back to my Channel today I'm
going to film a few updates on to my
project pans I have going on this video
here is going to be the finish by by
Cinco de Mayo update this is me update 1
just to let you guys know I am NOT going
to be filming a finished 7 by spring
update I'm just gonna do a finale I
started that challenge late and then i
uploaded late and then there was like
only a month and a half before it was
even over so I just I didn't get it up
and now it's like almost here so I'm
just gonna come a finale one with that
one but getting back to this video I
feel good about the progress I've made
but I'm also a little stuck some of the
items I thought that I would make more
progress on I haven't and that's just
been kind of frustrating or annoying but
I'm trying to work past it I have tomei
so hopefully it's one of those things
that you know you're using you're using
using and then you hit pan and kind of
finish it kind of fast I don't know if
that's even a thing or if I made that up
right now let's just get into the video
so i can show you guys my progress and
wearing that this is my first item here
this is the Physicians Formula organic
wear tinted moisturizer in light to
natural it was hard to say that a
million times this is where I originally
was when I first started this project
and now i am down to the red line this
item I cannot see where my progress is
out so I am just guessing at where I'm
at I have been using this in conjunction
with another foundation since I started
this project so I don't necessarily use
this all on my own I like this product I
think it's okay I just want to use it up
I've had it for a long time and I feel
good about the progress they made I
definitely think that I can finish this
up I may I will say though it's put a
wrench in things starting school when I
go to school they don't want me wearing
makeup and school because we're going to
be practicing makeup on ourselves and on
each other so you're supposed to go on
bare faced and that's two days and I
would be wearing makeup that I'm not
anymore and that has been difficult for
me in the sense of like using products
so I thought I would have two extra days
to be using things that I don't if it
gets to the end with this I might just
wear this over like as a tinted
moisturizer just this when i go to
school just to use it up I mean I don't
mind the coverage and it's something
easy I can take off for school we can
wear makeup they just asked us not to
you or if you are okay with not wearing
makeup they say it's a good idea just
because you'll be taking it off anyway
so I'm get in trouble if I wear this but
if it comes to the end I will just use
this up that way but I definitely still
think I'll be finishing this on time on
May fifth so there's that item another
item that I have to use up is this tart
emphasize cream eyeshadow in shimmering
golden beige I have made decent progress
in there I don't know if you can see up
by the rim there is no product anymore
so it's basically just in the base of it
now this I thought it'd be farther but
once again I haven't been wearing makeup
every single day so that's been new for
me I also can tell that this product
plus I've had a lot of other golden
items in different parts of pans I'm
just kind of over bowled like I don't
want to work old anymore I feel like
every look I make is gold and I just all
over it so it's been hard to use this
cuz it's gold and shimmery it's not even
just like a neutral shimmery color but i
will keep using this keep on truckin
through it i'm hoping i can finish this
up again i use this everyday or try to
use this every day as an eye primer
unless i'm doing like a matte look but i
try not to do that just so i can finish
this up but i hate that oh it's the
worst um they gotta try to use this up
I'm I don't even want to use this as a
highlighter because again i have this
and then i'm using the lorac spotlight
which is also like a golden color i have
benefit what's up little mini in a
project pan which is also gold I mean
I'm telling the coldest everywhere and
I'm just like over gold but you know
we're just going to keep working through
it i think i'm just going to keep using
it the same way i have and hopefully
just keep making progress in this one
again i haven't
me so I think that it's possible the
other chart item that I had in my
project pan was this one this is the
cheek stain in the color flush now if
you can see those little blinds the top
one there that's where it was and then
right below it is where i am now i was
using this every single day or as often
as I could remember underneath my makeup
I don't know if you can see there at the
lip you can kind of see that it's dented
down from where to rejoin why sorry it's
kind of dirty but I just this is not
part of my normal regular routine
putting this on before I put on powder
so I do forget a lot of the time
especially if I'm in a hurry and now
that my routine isn't like every day
it's split up between Tuesdays and
Thursdays when I don't want to make up
it's been hard to remember to reach for
this on the days that i actually do wear
makeup so this progress is probably made
in a good like three weeks of mostly
using it so i think it's possible to use
it up i'll show you the actual product
so that's what i have to use up there I
definitely think it's doable it's just I
have to use it like I have to use it
every day I think for it to actually be
all the way finished up by May so I'm
just gonna do as much as I can if I
don't finish this item I won't be a
hundred percent upset but I just want to
make as much progress as possible so my
goal is to be using this every single
day underneath a makeup when I'm wearing
it so hopefully this one will be gone i
really want to use this up i don't want
it anymore like I just I'm so
disappointed to have a million of these
to go through oh boy why did I do that
to myself it does not even make sense it
doesn't this was the Elizabeth Mont
pearl eyeshadow I think it's a shadow
stick but it's kind of in an eyeliner
form this is recently sharpened and it
definitely is shorter than it was so
that's how big it is now definitely
shorter I'm getting really close to the
writing here I tried using this on my
waterline and they didn't like it I just
it didn't really brighten it didn't
really do anything so i wouldn't use it
there i have been using this just on the
inner corner of my eyes this product as
much as I'm just over it because it's
kind of immunity is more of a champagne
color instead of like gold but i am just
over it I
he that I always have to have a mad
sparkly inner corner instead of just
like shimmer or I don't know just Matt
but bright I am just kind of getting
over it plus the sting on power on this
is like insane so if other makeup has
worn off by the end of the day this is
still there like gleaming it does not go
away it's definitely long-lasting
they'll give it that I'm just getting
I'm over it once again it's not like a
product I'm using every day because I
love it I'm just using it to use it up
so hopefully this one will go fast I've
been trying every single day to work it
into a look it's just hard like what if
my eyes are all sparkly and I don't want
Sparkle in the inner corner like but I
have to or else I feel like I have to I
mean I don't hate it I don't you know
I'm not trying to be super negative in
this video but it's definitely been a
struggle so I will hopefully have more
progress on that I want to be down to
like here next video we'll see but yeah
I definitely want to be done with this
and this too faced chocolate soleil
bronzer is my last item in the project
pan I have used this I use this every
single day every day to do my bronzer I
don't even have another bronzer in my
bathroom to use there's no possible way
I could use a different one and I just
feel like there's no progress like it's
coming down a little bit on the sides
but not even this item is baffling I
don't know how I cannot have hit pan on
it already it is an enigma I cannot I
just have no words there are no words
I'm still working on this every day it's
like I'm not going to put on a mad ton
of bronzer just to use this up but i
would like to hit pan pretty soon on it
I mean I think I bronze pretty much like
I Browns quite a bit i think for being a
fair girl and this is just not doesn't
care it's still going strong it's like
i'm gonna live my life regardless of
what you do to me so hopefully by next
update I
have Pamela I really want pan on this
just feel like you've got this girl
you're doing ok but this one's been hard
overall I haven't finished anything so
that's a little upsetting I guess I'm
but they are harder items it will say
that their items that take a little bit
to go through that I'll feel really
accomplished on when I do finish them up
but they're definitely slow going at
this point I have they been using them
like everyday I wouldn't say I've
neglected any of them i've been using
them all a fair bit so my goals from
this update on our achieves each of
those items every single day that i wear
makeup and not let those be something i
switch out just do it handle it let's
get some progress going on them if you
guys have any ideas for other things I
potentially could do with these items
let me know i would love to at least
have suggestions and see if those might
work for me I don't want this to be
negative I know I'm a little
disappointed but I am excited about the
progress i have made and i know that you
know just keep working through it and
make more progress but i just want to
see it i want to see it physically see
the progress in the pan but anyway i
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
i will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
