would do a quick update really fast on
my finished five by Cinco de Mayo I
didn't update I don't even know how long
do I want to say maybe three weeks ago
or so uh i don't know i thought i would
do this one though just so i could do
one last update before i do my finale
because we are about I think it's the
fifth of April today that I'm actually
filming so this look up a little later
but I thought I'd just get this one up
there just to kind of show you the
progress and my expectations for where
i'm at now and where i think i'll be so
yeah let's just get in to the video my
first item is the tart sharon golden
beige cream shadow I did kind of put
this all to the bottom but there's still
so much product left in there I'm trying
my hardest on this and I'm using it like
every single day but any time I wore
makeup but it's just not wanting to go I
did this so i could stop getting it
underneath my nails because it's
disgusting I'm just gonna try my hardest
to make as much progress on this as
possible until the finale and you know
just keep using it even after but I
don't know if I'm gonna make it I'm
after this guy's gonna make it so we'll
see this is the tart flush cheek stain I
have been trying my hardest to use this
every day you can see in there where the
lip is that there is quite a bit of it
gone but when I measure it up to this
there's no more progress than when i
worked last time even though i have been
using it so yeah that's how much prop
product is left this one's also going to
be one that i'm just going to do my best
on and use as much as possible it's just
a hard product to use a lot of I mean
what I can't just put it all over my
face um yeah a lot of these are like
that I just oh I thought these were
going to be hard but like still finished
by the time and that has not been the
case so far this is my physician formula
true or organic where I'm sorry tinted
moisturizer
am at this black line now about I can't
tell for sure honestly I've made some
like pretty decent progress like it's
the same amount of progress every single
time but I just this is also difficult
because I don't wear it on its own I
wear it with another thing so you know
and I don't wear foundation every single
day like yesterday didn't we went hiking
like that type of stuff so I'm gonna
again just like be using this as much as
possible but and try to see if I could
get this finished but that I mean it
doesn't seem like a lot of product but
that's a lot of product to use it only
like a month's time we'll see i'm
working on it i'm working my little
booty off but you know i guess i'll go
into good news this is my too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer and I hip and
yeah that feels so good this bronzer
it's pressed really hard so you can use
this for so long and you don't see any
progress really and then probably like
five days ago or so I hit pan on it so
that's really exciting that gives me
hope that this guy could at least be
really close to finished by the time is
this projects over but i'm just going to
at least hit pan like you can see the
progress like I'm i promise i'm trying
to use these things but that's so
exciting to me yay pan i love it it's so
funny that the sight of pan can just
make you feel so good that's crazy
especially because you don't want to use
things up because you spent a lot of
money but you do because you spent money
and if you don't use it I don't know
anyway it's kind of a trippy thing then
the last item here this is my Stila stay
all day liner in the color oscar fish
again i can't roll this up and let you
guys know but i will say i have been
trying to use this every single time I
do my makeup and put on my lower lash
line I didn't today because I thought I
grew up this and I grabbed a different
one but i have been using this pretty
exclusively on my lower lash line unless
a look is very specifically not a bronze
color but again i am trying to work on
that as well
I will say this update is kind of a
little lame it's a little disheartening
going in thinking that I'm not going to
finish some of these items but I'm
really just going to stay positive and
just try to finish as much as i can so
goal isn't necessarily a date it's just
to motivate you to use your stuff up I
mean obviously you want to try to hit
the date but this project has done good
I mean it's made me use these items when
I probably wouldn't have even made this
much progress so that is something
positive to keep in mind I you know stay
positive about it that is everything for
this update guys I will see you in my
next video let me know how you're doing
in your project pans or in your finish
five by Cinco de Mayo so I can kind of
check you guys out maybe that'll
motivate me I'm really I'm gonna work
really hard to get these things as far
down as I can since it's like crunch
time I only have a month left so I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
