blown out from the light but I was
trying to film another video and I think
my camera batteries died I don't even
know half the time it's just crazy
things go on with the camera and I hope
that I can kind of like to get and make
it work but i will say whoa oh man that
was intense there there was a lady an
electric wheelchair that passed by and
she just totally ramped up this speed
bump like she went for it she totally
did it good for her and that was extreme
though so tribute okay anyways sorry
guys it just was not expecting that this
video is going to be my good for her I
just wow unafraid I would be so
terrified um this is going to be my
finished 7 by spring that's totally
false that's totally false this is going
to be finished six by summer and I am
doing an update i can't believe it's
already been a month since i did my last
video but I've used up some things and
I'm excited to show you the progress
first things first this was started by
the budding minimalist i will link her
channel down below and if you guys want
to join it on this definitely join in
you're picking out six sons you can
either do like six individual items or I
chose six cent categories and then chose
a specific amount of items within those
categories but do whatever you want
let's get into the progress the first
thing I want to show you guys are the
candles that I've used up I'm sorry
there's like it's like as soon as I you
film then someone's like cleaning
something or eating me okay so I've used
up this candle here this is Copacabana
beach this was the first candle on my
left ear it smells so good it is the
best candle I'm so sad it's done but I'm
also happy at the same time but as you
can see there there's a little bit of
wax but with these Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
candles they don't burn pass ID I know
you can take the wax out and like heat
it I'm just so you know I'm not going to
do that um I just can't be bothered
really like this
no that's lazy or just honest another
candle i have finished up is this
woodwick candles s is a negative flavor
the scent vineyard and this is from GG
TJ maxx this one did burn down basically
all the way especially when you look in
there you can see the glass bottom I'm
glad this is done the scent just I was
just over it the crackling is cool but
then part of me doesn't like the
crackling cuz when i'm home alone it
just freaks me out like someone's
breaking in someone's breaking into a
bag of candy in my house where are they
like I don't know um it just sounds like
crackling and if you kind of are like
you forget that you're burning this it
can freak me out randomly um but it's
done so two candles done and then I have
two more and at four on the list in
total so um this is the other one this
is pomelo grapefruit I think I was about
here when my first video and so I have
been burning this one this is the one
I'm currently burning this look so great
I really like how citrusy this is it's
just a very fresh scent I mean it's
still sweet but it's very citrus and
grapefruit it smells great I really like
this I'm excited to finish it but again
it'll be a sad one because I do really
like the size and then the candle I
haven't even started burning is Sunset
Beach I don't know if you can you can't
even see it how blown out I am right now
but lighting in this video anyway this
one is one of my sense i got last year
when this whole collection was out it
smells okay but um I just want to get it
done I have two of these and they're
just like a generic BG sent so I want
this to be going I'm excited that I'm so
far i'm not going to add a candle and
yet until i finish up a couple more and
then i'll probably be adding things in
to replace what i have been using up
because yeah it's a lot of stuff that
i've already used and i still have until
the end of june july jun 27th i'm not
sure about the date I will leave it in
the description bar because I cannot
remember but it's one of those one the
next category is for breeze on
this one's kind of a weird one but i
just i don't have normal sent things I
don't do instance or oils or anything
like that so I put this in I just want
to use this up by the time summer hits
because it is Hawaiian Aloha and I had
one from like a false scent and I had it
for like two years and it's like you
don't want to use that you don't use
like cinnamon pie in the summertime like
it just doesn't for me like I don't like
that um but this one is wine Aloha and I
honestly I can't tell you where I'm at
it feels about here I'm just making sure
that I'm focusing on actually using this
in situations that might need it that's
it I mean I'm not like worried about
this I just definitely want to make sure
I don't have it around and it's winter
time and i probably won't I really just
don't need that type of product because
I have candles and I just don't need
those so I just need to stop myself from
buying them in the store really so what
I need towing something boring walk away
from the febreze you've never why do you
want for breeze what the heading serious
because I brought this thing that's all
my things on up to make it last the next
category are hand sanitizers I have four
here this one is the warm vanilla sugar
and I don't know if you can tell in
there there is like one use left out of
this thing and it's really hard because
if it's in your purse you might not be
able to actually get out that much so um
I will be you know this is basically
done so that's good this is the 1 i've
been using nexus is white pair in fig
this is like my favorite soap sent ever
it smells so good it came out for
christmas and i have like three backups
in the big soap and i think i have
another little one because i'm saying
but i am about here this was full when i
started and yeah i love this scent we're
working on that i have two other ones
here and they both look like they have a
little bit gone from him but i haven't
used them so i don't know if they just
started out that low or what but um
those i'll be working on once i finish
up that other one
I'm not going to start like multiple
ones we don't need 80 80 of those open
next our roller balls so I have decided
to see her that I am NOT going to
purchase any more roller balls that I'm
going to working on the roller balls
that i have and i'll probably just never
really purchase them unless i'm trying
to test out a scent that I want but
really I just don't gravitate to them I
don't use them and so they just sit
there and it's annoying so I have three
that I want to use that by summer this
one here you can see where that black
line is and then I've used a little bit
of this what's going on um I've used a
little bit of this but i am using up
another roller ball so i'm trying to use
that one at first before this one
because this is I'm more time to use
this epidemic sense but i have used it a
couple times i'm probably only twice and
it made that much progress so um i'm not
worried about that and blythe at least
some progress you can see something on
this and then the other two roller bowls
that i have i have not even used so yeah
nothing this is they're both from
Demeter Demeter want to save Dementor
but it's not um ones dragon fruit and
one is salt air and these are perfume
oils and I'm mostly just trying to use
these up because I've never used them
they're from an Ipsy bag and I just you
know I didn't pick these out so they're
just since they sent to me and I mean
hopefully I can use them up and not
waste them but I might just pass them on
if I don't use them up in this project I
have one body splash in here and this is
a country-chic one it's a little
travel-size from Bath and Body Works if
you can see the two lines yeah my gosh
my bell bottom like sleeve um you can't
really see it I'm sorry guys hopefully
it's better when I actually said it but
I've used just the tiniest bit of this i
am using another spray in another
project so i've been keeping this in my
purse but then i was using this one more
than that one and I was like that's not
right I should be using that one more
than this one yeah but I just want to
use this up anyway by the end
of this like by the time the summer
starts and I think that I can definitely
do it um but i have i've been just
trying to remember to use it as much as
possible so you know there's at least
some progress on it but once that other
projects over I can definitely focus it
on this one and since it's a smaller
bottle it it gets used up faster because
there's not as much product in the last
category ready to the last one I'm
really crazy in this video the last one
is my wall flowers so these are
wallflowers from bath and body works
they plug into the wall and you can have
them going and have sent in your house
but you don't have to worry about like
not being at home in a fire starting or
something this one in here currently is
the peach market peach sent I've already
started this one obviously and it is
about a little more than halfway done so
that one is working on as we speak
basically but not really as I'm speaking
because it's in my hand and then I have
two more that I want to use up once that
one's gone this is ocean driftwood and
this is sun-drenched vineyard I'm just
using these one at a time I go back and
forth um I don't know I like that these
smell good when you're not at home you
can walk into your house and it smells
awesome but not all the sense for me
translate really well into the
wallflowers I love market peach but I do
not like it in the wallflower it just
doesn't smell right it just smells
really faking sweet and just not the
same to me and that is the same way I
felt with another one that I just used
up it was unlike an apple one it was in
my empties video which I'll link down
below and it just smelt way too sweet
and it just didn't smell good and I've
noticed that with this one and so I'm
hoping some of these work but I remember
loving Tiki Beach in it so I just don't
know I'm going back and forth whether i
like them at this point i think i won't
really repurchase any of them and i'm
just going to purchase candles that's
just where I'm at right now who knows I
might change my mind but with this
project that's something that I've kind
of discovered from our that's something
I've kind of discovered about myself
anyway that is everything guys I hope
you enjoyed this video I hope
a wonderful day and I don't have like
super big goals for what I want to use
up in the next month or so until the
next update just because I feel like I'm
doing really well in the next update is
when I'm going to add in any products if
i'm going to replace anything that I've
used up it'll probably be a candle
though everything else seems to be going
at a decent rate in enough time to
finish without like stress but I can
definitely probably put in a couple more
candles so I will see you in my next
video goes by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
