Lauren this is going to be my finish 6
by summer finale I'm filming this a
couple days early but it's just because
I know I'm not gonna finish anything
that's left over by the time this is
edited and uploaded this will be on time
I think which is like a first for me
whoo um anyway let's get into the
products I kind of did the mix you guys
know between like finish that's by
summer and kind of the red white and
blue finish for my fourth of July so I
picked more than six items and because
of that I did actually hit six items
which is awesome but more details to
come let's get into it you guys know I
used up my it cosmetics bye bye pores
I'm not going to go into reviews too
much because you guys have heard it a
million times I felt this was okay i
probably wouldn't purchase it because it
is expensive but it's finished this is
the Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser in the color fair I
thought this was ok it's totally used up
I like my Maybelline fit me better so
I'm gonna go back to that instead of
this but it was ok this is the steel a
convertible color eyeliner this is in
the color indigo and this was my blue
item I've completely used this up I'm
twisting it and nothing comes up I use
this to tightline it was ok these are
discontinued so you can even purchase
them so who cares if I would I threw two
brow products in here the first one I
wanted to finish up was the Vincent
Longo and this is there really skinny
pencil as you can tell like this is a
not a normal sized pencil it is tiny I
really like the idea of this because you
get more product than you do in a twist
up pencil but you still get the small
point because it's just a tinier pencil
but because it's so tiny I poked my eye
out a couple times which was horrendous
so I'm glad to be done with this but I
did enjoy this product and then because
I knew that one was on its way out I
decided to throw another brow pencil in
here this is the two-faced brow pencil
and the color blondie this is a
discontinued item it was ok it's a very
waxy pencil I felt like it built a
product in my brows but I liked the
color it was a really nice ashy cool
tone color I personally though lately
have been into just finer tipped pencils
I've been doing my brows a little bit
less thick and just more delicate than
if I
and every day again is a different crowd
a for me but that's just what I've been
liking more lately so I think in the
future I'm definitely going to be
getting more thinner brow pencils you
guys already knew that I hit pan on the
two shades in here but i did finish one
up entirely so there was a bronzer shade
and then the contour shade they didn't
have any pan in them at all when I
started this one the bronzer shade is
completely used up I'm so proud of that
and then obviously in the contour shade
I used that and it hit pan I'm hoping to
use is up at the end of the year so I
could just get rid of this I might even
deep pot it just sorta have to keep all
this bulky packaging around just for the
one shade but I'm so happy this is like
a really big one for me and the last
item that it actually used up was my
buxom lip pencil you guys this is the
first full-size lip product i've ever
used up i think ever i'm very proud i
started all the way up here that was my
first update and my second update and
now it's completely gone i can't roll it
up at all I didn't pick it out or
anything but it feels so good to get
this done I miss it I love this product
I'm definitely going to repurchase it
once i use up other things in my
collection I definitely suggest this and
i'll leave it linked down below I know
someone that said they couldn't find it
so i will make sure it's linked so that
you can find it i'm so happy about the
syllabus and the smashbox one are like
my favorite items that i finish out of
here because they're just like bigger
things to me to finish and the last item
i believe in my project was the red item
and I didn't finish it the white item
was the translucent powder even though
its transition translucent it looked
white that's why I picked it anyway this
is the shadow I wanted to hit pan on I
was pretty close I feel like if I had
used it maybe five to ten more times
they would have hit pan but I just found
that I wanted to use Pink's instead of
breads and i was using this a little
more consistently this month but i don't
know i just didn't want to always have
read on my eyes i love it i like the way
it looks but i just wanted to try
different things like the grungy look
with the blue lip i really liked that
which you know i'm not going to put red
in that i'm so close and yet so far in
this so i wish i'd hit
but I didn't but I'm still really proud
of making it done in this and putting
this in this is kind of like a riskier
courageous product put in
you
but that's my finish six by summer it
was nice to clear out quite a few
products and just a little bit of time
and I'm excited to continue working on
things through other projects right now
I'm doing my finish 13 by Halloween
project pan roulette addition i will
leave that video linked down below if

doing the seven summer fling so i have a
lot of projects going on i hope you guys
