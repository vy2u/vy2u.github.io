just wrapped up a project pan and now
i'm going to be starting a new seasonal
project pan i'm going to be doing the
finish Knicks by summer i was tagged by
love Heatherette here on youtube i
talked about her a lot I'll leave her
channel link down below and of course I
wanted to jump on and I'm kind of doing
a little bit of a twist on this jen and
glitter here also started the finish for
by fourth of July tab for this year and
then she also made it were three of the
products had to be red white and blue so
I kind of morphed that into here so i
picked about not actually six i think it
picked like eight products so i have a
to like bonus type of items but out of
those eight three of them are going to
be red white and blue I wanted to do
both but I'm trying to give myself a
little bit of breathing space i'm doing
so well this year on using up products
and I'm really proud of my progress but
I still want to be able to have fun and
do what I want with my makeup and
everything so that is how I'm kind of
remedying that it's my channel so I
thought I can kind of do what I want to
guess so let's get into the products
that I want to use or hit pan on by
summer the first item I want to hit pan
on our myspace box contour trio I am
already used up the highlight shade and
I want to hit pan on one or both I don't
know which one will be first but I do
use these sometimes by themselves and
then sometimes together so if I can hit
pan on one of these shades I'd be really
happy i love this i love this contour
palette blushing shades of beauty I
believe her name is Lisa she was just
talking about it and I I've been using
this since my last project pan when I
had a bronzer and I love this and I just
think like she'd mentioned we just don't
hear enough about this product I think
that the cool toned contouring this is
like perfect and I also think the
bronzer is really great I just it's a
really great trio and I think it's
amazing so I want to hit pan on one or
both of these that's one of my items oh
shoot this is my tart project but I
didn't show it I'm showing it now that's
so bad I finished it though I'm sorry
guys I'm sorry well blame it on the
sickness although i know that if
wasn't sick i probably would have done
that I do that a lot the next item I
want to use up is this instant age
rewind dark circle eraser erase their
dark circles I don't know this is from a
belaying a lot of people really like
this and it's not that i don't like it i
just prefer my maybelline fit me over
this and i bought both of them at the
same time and i know that i will use
that one and i have been using that one
over this one so i just want to get it
gone i am right here on it so I know
these go pretty fast from all the ones
I've seen in projects and people talk
about it so I just want to use this up
first so that way i have the thing i
love left instead of like wishing and
wanting the thing i love because i used
it at first if that makes sense anyway I
want to use this up I definitely think
it's doable in about three months I am
throwing a lip product in here because
I've really been enjoying this lip
product i've been wearing it almost
every day this is buck soms dolly these
lip pencils are my favorite I think
formulation of lip pencils they're just
so nice and they are selling buxom at
Ulta now which I'm so happy about but it
is what I'm wearing on my lips now
although I do have like my makeups kind
of crazy I mean I have like gold
freckles on right now so you know but
that's how much product i have left it's
kind of a lot and I do feel like this is
turning a little bit as in going bad or
about to go bad so I just want to get my
money's worth out of this definitely it
would be a repurchase once i finish up
more lip products i just love this
product so good it has a minty feeling
stays on the lips really really well
it's matt but not super drawing i just
love it i would like to finish one brow
product in this project but it also i'm
throwing in another one in case i finish
it up this is from vincent longo so it's
just as like super mini brow pencil i
just bought new brow pencils from
maybelline because i made an order
online at Ulta I got the peanut butter
and jelly palette and to get free
shipping i had to spend 50 and i thought
it was worth it so what are the things i
was trying to make sure i was doing was
getting items in my collection that I
would actually go through i knew i would
use instead of just picking up like
random eyeshadows and random stuff just
to hit it so i picked up two of the
maybelline define a brow I do like that
pencil a lot and I've just been using
that lately instead of trying to finish
these up so I want to finish this up and
then if I do finish that I want to
continue on to
the two-faced what is this eyebrow
pencil and this is in the color blondie
this is discontinued so I just like to
get these out first before I just again
go through the newer products in my
collection but if I just finish up one
of these in this project I would be
happy the last item that isn't a part of
like the red white and blue thing is
this to face blush this is a mini in the
color love hangover it's a really pretty
peachy color I'm wearing it today I've
really been enjoying wearing this using
like a duo fiber stippling brush so that
I can get like a really nice light wispy
application it has the two-faced imprint
in it I really want hit pan on it but if
I just got rid of the imprint and you
couldn't see that at all I would also
just be happy with that I know it's kind
of lame sorry but it's a blush and
blushes are difficult so I just really
want to make sure I see progress out of
this item because I bought that love
flush kid I'll link the hall down below
where I hauled this set but I bought it
because of the blushes and I've just
found that I've barely been using them I
haven't I just pulled this one out so i
have been using this one a little bit
but i want to kind of justify that
purchased by like hitting pan or just
getting a good amount of use out of this
blush so so for my three like red white
and blue items I I don't know I kind of
chose some fun ones I think it's kind of
tricky to use those colored items for
makeup you know so for the red item i am
trying to hit pan on the shade here this
is from wet while this is the california
roll palette this was limited edition i
think last summer from there like silver
lake collection or something this
palette screams me i love it so much but
i haven't been using it so i want to use
that I think it'd be a really pretty
crease color you know I was thinking
about it I did this look I was kind of
inspired I was inspired by LS I was
inspired by butterflies I was kind of
like Mad Hatter style some golden
freckles I don't really know it's like
an Easter crazy look this is what I'd
wear for Easter that's why I went with
this but I realized like oh I don't feel
well and you can hear that in my voice
and I'm like putting like Pinker on my
eyes I mean that's my style but um yeah
I don't know where's mine with that I
guess because red and pink can kind of
make you look sick but I kind of like
that
look I know that's weird but I do anyway
I wanna use that in my crease that's I'm
trying to say here I think it'd be
really pretty in the crease and just
like a really fun like bronzy marsala
kind of golden look I think that'd be
really pretty so I want to try to hit
pan on that before summer hits for my
blue item I want to use up this liner
from steel akasha always don't look like
I know what I'm doing this isn't the
color indigo so it's not like you know
completely blue it's kind of like a blue
purple Indigo's kind of like you put it
next to blue it looks purple you put the
next purple looks blue but it's pretty
much a dark blue so I want to use this
up this is my last stila convertible
color eyeliner I cannot wait to have
this out I have been since I had my
channel been trying to pan these and I
had five of them originally and I'm down
to one go me I'm so excited so I want to
use the stuff of the year I thought this
would be a good time to throw it in
because it is a blue item you know you
know I just told you already so I wanna
use that up and the last thing for white
this isn't rolling white it's a
translucent powder but it kind of looks
white so that's why I'm counting it this
is from it cosmetics it's the bye bye
pores and I am about here on it so a
little under half way i was using this
I'll ton when I you know kind of used up
some of the powders i was using but now
that i've been using powder foundations
which i'm almost done so since i'm
almost done with my powder foundations i
just thought i would focus back in on
this item i made a lot of progress
pretty fast because I set the crap out
of my makeup and so I want to just
finish this up and get it gone it was a
really expensive item so I'm gonna feel
really really happy once i get my
money's worth out of this one this was
like thirty dollars i think i'm not
saying it's a bad product I'm just
saying I don't think I'd repurchase it I
don't know it's not bad it's just a lot
of money for a loose setting powder for
me I think the bed 91 is pretty dang
good and it's not nearly as expensive
okay guys that is my finish six by
summer which is really finished eighth
