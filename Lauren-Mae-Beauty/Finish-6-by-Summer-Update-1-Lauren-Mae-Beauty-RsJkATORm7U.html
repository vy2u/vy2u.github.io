project pans I would just continue with
updating my other project pan I have all
my items here this is my finished six by
summer I was tagged by love Heather head
I will link her channel down below and
then I kind of wanted to throw in the
finish before by fourth of July with the
red white and blue stuff that Jenna
glitter created so I kind of have eight
items and not six so let's just get into
the progress I feel like even though
it's only been a little bit since I've
started this project I do have some good
progress to show you guys so this is my
when wild six pantai shadow palette in
the color California roll I am trying to
work on this red shade as my red shade
for red white and blue I do have some
like brush dips in it but there's
nothing really to show you yet I've used
this about four times or so and i'm
really going to kick it into high gear
this next month i want to use it
basically like every other day just to
see what kind of progress i can make on
it and then go from there i really like
the way i've been using it in the crease
just give me a really warm look and when
i use it with browns you almost can't
tell that it's like a red shadow or I
mean maybe you can but it's not like
just like completely like hell eyes or
something so I think it'll be good I'm
excited to use it about every other day
this next month some really awesome
progress this is my Smashbox contour
trio and I hit pan on both of the shades
so I kinda already have my goal on this
one I'm going to continue using these I
think and just trying to use them up but
then I'm kind of tempted to just use
other things in my collection now that I
do have pan on both of them so i'm not
sure where i'm gonna go i'm gonna like
let each day kind of guide me it's nice
to know what i want to use it's already
in my drawers but i also have a lot of
bronzers I've been neglecting in a lot
of contour shades that I've been
neglecting because i've been using this
so i'm not really sure what I want to do
but I'm really happy to see that
progress I hit pan on this one like a
couple days after film the video and
then I just hit pan on this like two
days ago so I am really happy about that
one I knew it was going to be soon but I
didn't know how soon so I'm it feels
good this is my Maybelline age rewind
concealer as you can tell there is a ton
of
progress on this I mean this will be
done in like three weeks I don't know if
I just like seriously use a ton of this
or if it's because I use a cream bronzer
and contour as well that makes me use
more of this or something but I mean
jeez I use it's like it's going out of
style so I this'll be no problem I'll be
done with this very soon I do enjoy this
product but I will not purchase it again
I'd rather have my fit me concealer so
as much as I like it it's I mean I'm
glad I don't hate it when I'm using it
but I will repurchase this is my steal a
convertible eyeliner so I started kind
of where that top line was although I
feel like that line was wrong I feel
like it was a little higher and I am
just a bit below it i've been using this
in my tight line and been enjoying it
you can't tell it's blue but this is my
blue product and i don't think this will
be any problem to finish at all so i'll
just be trucking through this one this
is probably the one I am most excited
about this is my buxom lip pencil and
dolly and i have been using this every
day I've just been in love with it so
it's been nice that it has a miniature
to use I started up at the top line
there I know it's kind of hard to see
and I apologize but I am down to the
second line this is the product i can't
really like put it against it because i
was getting cocky and you know so
excited about it that i kept rolling it
up every day to kind of like see where i
was and was like excited about it and i
frickin broke it off which i almost
cried but then I didn't and I stuck it
back on there and so I'm still able to
use it but it's definitely delicate so
um I'm hoping that I'll be able to just
continue using this even with that
little mishap and hopefully it won't
affect me using it but I'm really really
happy about this you guys know lip
products are like the death of me and
I'm just happy to have found a product
that I actually want to use everyday and
basically I want to see in my collection
how many lip products are like that and
then just repurchase those products and
like get rid of everything else so this
is definitely something I'm going to
repurchase once i finish it i really
really like it it looks so so so so so
good love it i'll show you guys my blush
there really isn't much of a change on
this i have been using it every single
day
the two-faced is definitely wearing off
but it's still there I can definitely
see it when I'm up close so I'm still
working on that I've been enjoying it
every day nothing special but I haven't
been using it as an eyeshadow so I think
that's why there's not a ton of progress
so a brow products I'm considering this
pencil done this is from Vincent Longo
and it's in the shade blonde that is it
there I went in to put this on my eye
today and I was like this and freaking
stabbed my I like with my finger hurts
so bad and it's not one of those like oh
me I got my I know like I had to take a
break my i was watering i had to take a
break for 20 minutes and even today I
can still feel like later on today I can
still feel where I hid myself so it's
not worth it anymore and I did hit
myself in the eye one other time not as
bad but it's just done I cannot I can't
do it on my brows without hurting myself
I think that gives is enough reason to
stop using it and it's done it was
getting harder to sharpen that's
something I was realizing well after I
hit myself in the eye and I was you know
pondering my life decisions that
automatic pencils although you don't get
as much product it's nice because
consistently you have the same length of
pencil which is nice as compared to
something that sharpens it just gets
smaller and smaller and harder to use so
that is I feel like a pretty unreal
considerable trade-off and something to
consider when you are getting brow
pencil so think about it before you poke
yourself in the eye that is done and so
because of that i am going to be
focusing on the two-faced one this is
what this is what it looks like it's in
the shade blondie and i will just be
using this i basically use this in the
front portion of my brows and then i'll
use my maybelline one because it's
thinner on the bottom or the outside
half of my brows i'm in the tail so yeah
i'm down to the other brow pencil so
that's good in the last item this is my
translucent powder from it cosmetics I'm
about here so I feel like I'm definitely
farther down than I was I've been using
this every day and I don't think this
will be a problem either this is my why
product technically although it is
translucent I just worked well I thought
so those are all my items and my update
on this project I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day thanks so much
for your love and support and I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
