lauren thanks so much for watching i
have a ton of updates to do today so
we're just going to chill out i'm going
to update you on different projects i
have going on i'm also starting to new
projects which is super exciting so
those videos will be to come in a film
while today i also wanted to say thank
you to all the beautiful and kind and
wonderful comments you guys have been
leaving me I'm sorry that I just suck
and haven't written back to like any of
you I'm sorry I'm working on it again
it's just not my thing I just I like
posting and watching and posting and
watching I'm like that's the part I love
but I mean I love seeing your guys's
comments I read them all and I take them
into account when I talk about things I
just I'm just that friend that sucks at
like texting people back and like
calling people and staying in touch
that's me so imagine it with like 50 of
my friends online we commented on a
video mm-hmm I'm just really bad so I'm
really sorry it's not personal it's like
my own issue we're gonna move on I've
talked about it a lot but I just have a
lot of anxiety about it and then I just
keep thinking about it and so that's
what I talk to you guys about it all the
time because it's an issue for me anyway
let's get into my items for my finish
six by some earth heather from love
Heatherette she tagged me in this so
that's why i decided to do it i wanted
to do it anyway but I was like oh that's
so sweet so i'll have her channel link
down below and then i also included this
with like Jen and glitters finish for by
fourth of July or you pick three items
like red white and blue so let's just
get into the update I feel really happy
with my progress we'll start off with
the items i finished i'm not sure for my
last update where it was so this is the
it cosmetics bye bye pores loose powder
and there is nothing left I took off the
stopper I just pop that out with a pair
of tweezers but I do suggest using like
chopsticks or something else I saw
someone else do that and I'm like oh
that's smart so you don't like bend your
tweezers and ruin them now i just have
like a set of tweezers for this type of
thing because they won't pluck any hair
out but this is completely down i
enjoyed this and I'm kind of at a place
right now with my powders and just like
in general I based products where I'm
not really finding a way to wear them so
hopefully that'll change
soon because it's irritating to not be
able to like like the base of your
makeup and I just took for granted how
much I enjoyed my face products before I
guess so this was nice I'm not gonna
ever purchase it but I do kind of miss
it because I don't have anything that's
similar to it if that makes sense
another item that's completely done this
is the Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer and this is in the color fair
I uses up so fast i bought this in
February at the end of februari and I
was done with this like definitely I
would say at the end of April so it was
like only two months I don't know I just
feel like I stole things a lot longer I
probably overused this but that's just
how I wear my makeup so for me it's not
overusing it just using it it's okay I
wouldn't repurchase it I just like the
maybelline fit me better than this so
i'm glad i give this another try because
i have used this one other time but i do
enjoy the maybelline fit me better and i
will continue to repurchase that one
before ever purchasing this i finish up
the Stila eyeliner i put in here this
isn't the color indigo and it doesn't
roll up anymore there's nothing in there
so this was my blue item and then just
let you know d by my pores was my white
item even though it's translucent but i
did finish that up now into brow
products i threw in the vincent longo in
this originally and it's quite tiny i'm
calling it done because as you guys
remember I poked my eye out with this
because it's just so short and your
fingers alike read by your eye and I
poked my eye out so I kind of knew I
would finish this pretty early on so I
at my intro said I would work on this
one next I'm still working on it but as
you can see the cap is almost hitting
this metal part that's all that I have
left product wise it's definitely
improvement from last update it's okay i
know they're coming out with new brow
products in fall so I definitely think
they'll be better than this I like the
color of this blonde one but I I don't
know it's kind of waxy it's like the
amount of product per pigment is
definitely less so I just feel like
there's a lot of buildup in my brows
without that much color payoff but it's
okay i don't like hate it i just want to
keep using it until it's done which I
definitely feel like I'll be done with
this before the summer and starts for
the summer starts this is another item i
actually had finished up this is the
contour kit from Smashbox and I
wanted to hit pan on the bronzer and the
contour so obviously I hit pan on the
contour and I hit a ton of hand on the
bronzer I love this bronzer I've really
been enjoying it lately and I did just
repress it this morning it's like the
worst repressing job ever there was the
tiniest little bit of a like sliver of
product around the edges and when I went
to my mom's house me and Sam just
traveled to my mom's house to Arizona
just randomly for the weekend cuz Sam
was often I don't I don't have a job I
don't do that thing anymore I guess well
hunt so we just ran over there for just
like 36 hours it was crazy but when I
brought this it cracked and I knew I
needed to repress it I just hadn't so
now it's repressed and I will be done
with that one really soon so I mean I
already at my main goal but I'm
definitely gonna be able to finish up
the bronzer let's get into the other
things oh I thought I would mention
because i repressed that what i use
these are the beauty spatulas I had
someone leave me a comment saying that
they wanted to know like what they
looked like so I have two different ones
Sam got me these for my birthday I
believe you purchased them at the
container store but this one here is
like a tiny little spatula and it's made
of like rubber spatula material so you
can really squeegee the sides of stuff
and then since it's so tiny you can
really get down in there this one is
quite a bit shorter than this one this
one's a bit longer and then this one's
like a triangle arrow type shape sorry
they're a little dirty and this one you
can get in like bigger areas I feel like
this is better for like foundations and
stuff but that's what they look like I
don't know the prices of that I don't
think that they're over ten dollars each
for sure I think they're like five some
things so I would check out the
container store if you have one or check
out online but you might be able to find
like cheaper ones on amazon I don't know
all right let's get on to the items that
I just have progress in and we'll start
with those so I have my red item here
this is my California roll palette from
wet and wild and I'm working on the red
as you can see you can kind of tell that
there's a dent going um like you can see
a bit of a dent not just crazy there's
one there I have not been using this
nearly as much as I thought I would I've
just been warned to pinks and because my
hair is pink I just haven't been using
it I really
really want to hit pan on it though so I
need to work on this the next month I
think everyone's saying that it's like
yeah jun 20th is the end because the
21st every three months on the 21st is
when it changes seasons I do want to hit
pan on this and I think that I can I
just really need to like step it up stop
being a baby and using that it's funny
because I really thought that one
wouldn't give me that much trouble
because I was into that but I'm telling
you my taste changes like every three
weeks so having like a three-month
project it can be difficult this is the
blush i was working on from Too Faced my
goal on it was just to not see the two
face anymore and technically that is
true you can't see the two-faced little
emblem anymore I've been using this
basically every single day for the last
three months like every day on the sides
of the pan you can see it going down but
I don't think that I'm anywhere near
close to hitting pan on this I'm gonna
try to incorporate this into some eye
shadow looks even more than I already
have just to kind of start getting a
bigger dip like in the middle and then
along with using it as a blush just to
see if I can maybe hit pan on it that's
what I'm gonna do with this i mean i
still feel happy with the amount of use
this has gotten but i do want to hit pan
so i'm gonna try that and see if maybe i
can get some pan at the end here and the
last item is probably be item i am the
most happy with and that is my buxom lip
pencil this is in the color dolly i love
this color and as you can see i had my
first update or my intro my first update
and now this update so lots of progress
i'll show you guys it only rolls up that
much like that's so insane i'm sorry
it's a little grody but i did break it
off and i use it all the time so it's
what's on my lips now i love it I've
told you guys I will repurchase this
when I finish it I've just fallen in
love with this color and it's made me
again realize that I don't eat all these
other colors I just need a few of my
actual favorites and to use those and to
love those and to repurchase those and
then forget about all the other crap
like for me personally I'm not a lip
person i know some people like lip
products are the thing let products are
not my thing I like getting some new
ones but really I just need some staples
that I can put on every time and no I
love so that's where I am with my finish
sex by summer I think I'm doing great I
don't
have too many worries the few things
that I feel a little worried about like
that blush I kind of technically already
hit my goal so hitting pan on it would
just be like extra satisfaction so that
feels really good that's why I feel
confident on starting to new projects as
well hope you guys enjoyed I will see
you in my next video have a great day hi
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
