it feels so good to talk to you I am
still sick I'm getting over being sick
I'm finally like able and feel good
enough or well enough to actually film
the last couple of days I haven't been
wearing makeup I mean to having you
wanted to get out of bed and it sucked
so I'm excited to be able to film today
I'm wanting to feel about four videos I
feel like I have so much to update you
on because I filmed those videos quite a
while ago it feels like and yeah a lot
of strange I just anyway I might do like
it should check get ready with me at
some point in the near future real fast
too I did do kind of like a crazy look I
told myself like just go simple today
and this happened I was inspired by LS
I'll leave her channel link down below
but she had this really pretty light
brow bone in her corner highlight it was
like this really pretty iridescent pink
and so I was just kind of inspired by
that and this is what happened I thought
I'd give her a shout out she does
project panning and stuff like that i
think if you like my channel you
definitely would like hers definitely go
check her out now let's get into the
video this is my finish 7 by spring
finale spring started just a couple of
days ago I'm sorry I'm a little late on
this but again I was sick it just wasn't
possible so let me show you where we're
at i'm gonna start off with the bad news
the tarte lipsurgence it's gone it's
gone I don't know where it went but it
is not with us any longer I know I had
it at school because I was wearing it at
school and then like seriously that day
when i got home i cannot i could not
find it i still can't find it i am upset
about it because i really wanted to
finish that product i really enjoyed
that product everyone thought it looked
really good on me like ah so irritating
and i'm not the type of person that
brings a product with them like a lip
product or anything to touch up with so
it's just frustrating like the one time
I try to do that I'd be like I'm gonna
get progress i'm gonna be at school i'm
going to get progress I lose it so it's
gone that one technically is like counts
as a declutter I guess it's not a part
of my collection anymore but it was
upsetting that I didn't finish it
actually now on to the other items i do
have the rest of them here
think that the ones i'm about to show
you our one cent you already know i
finished so we'll just get into that
this is the tart fairlight neutral
Amazonian clay full coverage airbrush
foundation it was just a little mini
sample I finish this up really fast and
this product kind of sparked this love
of powder foundations I have been
obsessed with powder foundations
basically since using this up they're
just so easy I don't feel like a hobbit
I product on my face but I still get a
ton of coverage I've just really been
enjoying it so I'm really glad that I
use this app that I enjoyed it and that
I kind of explored a new option and
foundation for myself I know you guys
know about this one this is my blush in
fantastic from again tart it was an alt
art project and I did hit pan on that
you can see the pan there I use this
product not only as a blush but I also
used it in my eyebrows I used it as an
eyeshadow I used in a bunch of different
ways to help make this have as much
progress as it does have I did really
enjoy this I'm excited that I hit pan on
a blush i only have pan on two blushes
now and they both been because of
project so i'm really happy with that
and i'm glad that i have another blush
to say i have pounds this would
technically be the fourth item so this
is the tart oh my gosh tart emphasize
aqua gel liner and it's just like a
brown color i did completely finish that
up i can't twist it anymore i did I
enjoy this product you guys know that it
was okay I just didn't like it we're
just gonna go on I'm so glad it's done
though I'm glad that I didn't give up on
this and I used it up and that I can
call it an empty instead of just a
cluttering it so I feel great about that
two more things this is the tart CC
primer yes primer I kind of used this as
a primer actually I would use it under
my powder foundations so i would put
primer on my real primer that fills in
pores and whatnot then i'd put this on
and it kind of just gave my skin a
little bit more color correction that
had gone to that powder foundation and
then I would do my concealer but I am
sad I can't open it I'm sad because I
hope you can see that that's all I have
left it's like an
thing um if you can see the lines there
I have like nothing left but technically
it's not finished so I feel really proud
of the progress I made all this and I
know if I didn't lose it for that first
like bit in the project I would have
definitely finished this so I'm just
gonna keep trucking through this you'll
see it in an empties soon once I
completely finish it up but I am happy
with the progress on this it just it was
like one of those things where you come
so close and you're just like why can't
i call it empty so anyway that is my
progress on the primer and then last you
guys already know i did hit pan on the
parasol shade that's it there i hit pan
on this a while ago i haven't been using
it since just because i have been trying
to hit pan on so many I shadows or as
many I chose as I can this year once I
kind of hit pan in this I just put it
away and I'm trying to work on other
shadows so that is my finale for my
finished 7 by spring tart edition I hope
you guys enjoyed this I didn't realize
that I it would be still so difficult
even though I'm feeling a lot better
that it would be difficult to film and I
feel like out of breath and stuff so I'm
sorry about my voice it irritates me but
I can only hear half of it because my
ears are like totally clogged from the
sickness TMI I'm sorry i'll see you in
my next video and i hope you guys are
having a wonderful wonderful day thanks
so much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
