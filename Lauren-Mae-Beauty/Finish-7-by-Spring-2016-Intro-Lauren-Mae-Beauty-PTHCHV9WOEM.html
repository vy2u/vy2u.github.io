channel it's Lauren this is going to be
an intro video for my finished 7 by
spring I have seen a couple people do
this and it's kind of sentimental for me
because my first project pan that I ever
did on a video was finished 7 by spring
so it's been a year since i started that
project and my one year on youtube is
coming up which is crazy anyway let's
get into the products i want to use up
by spring I believe the date on this is
by March 22nd so I will leave that
information down below a little
something special i wanted to do with
this project is I picked seven items but
I made them all by one brand so I
decided to look through my collection in
a lot of the older things in my
collection we're from torch I thought
that I would make that the theme of this
so I want to finish 7 tart items up by
spring the first thing I want to use up
is this tart CC colored clay primer this
is in the shade fair and I'll roll it up
for you guys I do enjoy this product I
think it's really nice I just want to
get it out it's kind of old so I don't
have too much here to use up you can
barely see it but I did mark it on the
cap and I think this should be too big
of a problem I'm just gonna use it
underneath my foundation every single
day I decided to pick a blush this is a
mini one this is tarts fantastic it's
one of the oldest blushes I have in my
collection because this is older it does
have more product than the newer small
ones so it has 3.0 3 grams in it I just
want to hit pan it's a very bright color
I am wearing it today it's kind of hard
to can't pack this color on or you'll be
crazy the imprint of it is already
wearing off like before I even started
so i'm hoping i can hit pan on this even
the smallest about app and i would be
happy with this is a deluxe size mini
that I have from Tarte this is the full
coverage airbrush foundation I think
this is going to go crazy fast I used it
today for the first time and it just I
needed a lot of product I I don't know
if I just like love product but I did
use quite a bit of this for just one
application so i do not think there will
be any problems using this up another
kind of face powder product this is the
it's smooth operator tinted pressed
finishing powder you like it said like a
tinted pressed powder so it kind of
works out that these are both deluxe
eyes minis because i think i can
probably get both of them finished even
though they're very similar items and
you wouldn't need to use both i'm being
brave and throwing a lip product in here
this is the tart exposed lipsurgence
this is a matte formula this isn't
rolled all the way down so it's not like
in there but I did at least get rid of
like the point on it this is just an
older item in my collection and because
it's matt i feel like it is drying out a
little bit the color is very neutral so
i think i can wear it without hating my
life lip products are super hard so
we'll see how I do on this I am starting
up there on that mark that's how much
product there is so i think i can do it
i just have to wear it everyday i am
going to pick an item in a palette this
is the Aqua lilies for tart palette I
think this palette is super pretty but
honestly I just haven't gone much use
out of it so I am wanting to hit pan on
this really light shade here i'm going
to use it as a face highlighter i have
it on today it's very intense I really
like it so I'm excited to move through
that one and if I hit pan on that or
when I hit pan on that it will also be
another shadow tip pant on for the year
so kind of two birds with one stone on
that one last item I'm going to be using
is this tart emphasize aqua gel eyeliner
it's just in a brown color this is a
very intense product it's very wet it
has dried out a little bit so I was able
to roll it up but it was super hard to
roll it back down like I almost broke it
off so I will not be rolling it back up
except for when i use it so it had about
this much product in it it's just very
intense i am going to be using it to
tightline and to smudge on the bottom
lash line like I always do with my
liners we'll see I just want this out
it's just a weird product so I just
wanted out that's it it's so much
shorter to film only seven products
instead of like 30 so it feels kind of
weird that it was so short but I hope
you guys liked this intro I'm excited to
continue doing seasonal project pans
throughout this year and just work on
getting even more makeup out of my
collection I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
