Lauren this is going to be an update for
my finish seven by spring I decided to
do this video as a one brand project so
everything I picked our Tarte items so
I've seven different items I'm going to
start off with the things I've already
finished I have finished two items all
over it - no two items already the first
one I'm the most excited about this was
the eye liner this is their emphasized
aqua gel eyeliner I did not really enjoy
this it was so creamy it was really hard
to like put on the lash line I use this
to tightline my upper lash line that's
basically what I use on my liners for
because I don't really like a harsh
liner look but I used this up there and
because it's so creamy it would just get
kind of goopy if I accidentally had too
much rolled up and not my favorite glad
it's gone we'll stop there but I am done
with that thank goodness I've been
wanting to use this for a long time the
other item I used up was the deluxe a
sample of the airbrush foundation this
is just a powder foundation I really
enjoyed this it kind of sparked this
love for powder foundations which I know
you guys know about because you watched
my other video right anyway I just have
really been enjoying powder foundations
and this really started it off this
month and I've really just I did enjoy
it I would potentially pick this up
maybe not this exact one but I've
definitely been looking into more powder
foundations and it was nice to use it
was a good color for me as well I do
have some exciting progress on some
other items although they're not
finished this is the pressed powder that
I am using up again another deluxe a
sample and I did hit pan on it this
morning which is crazy
so excited about that so I don't have
much more on this I definitely think
I'll have this finished by spring and
that is super exciting to get to face
powders out of my collection during this
project now I don't know this one might
be the most exciting actually forget
about that eyeliner this is my Tarte
blush and if you see that little dot
that is actual pan I have hit pan on
this blush and I have been using this in
other ways than just a blush I've been
using this basically every single day as
a blush but I've been using it on my
lower lash line I've also used it in my
brows and that has helped me kind of dig
out some pan in this I have enjoyed this
I'm kind of getting a
right like definitely want to explore
more blushes in my collection so I'm
going to expand the pan on this a little
bit more I mean technically I said if I
hit the tiniest amount of pan I'd be
done but since I still have like another
month or so like even more than a month
in this project I'm just gonna keep
working on it but I'm just not gonna
work on it every single day maybe like
half the week on half the week off or
something but I mean amazing I've only
hit pan on two blushes ever in my
collection so I'm super excited about
that I really didn't think I would be
able to hit pan so I know digging in
there with my brush to do my brows and
also to like smudge it under my lash
line has helped me make a dip that dug
down faster than if I just use the blush
brush but I'm totally ok with that
because I'm using the product and I'm
multitasking this product which is just
helping me use it up faster and just
it's fun to figure out different ways to
make products work for you and to move
out of your collection this one almost
has no progress on it so the reason for
that is because I thought I lost this
like I know we all lose lip balms and
lip glosses no I thought I lost a huge
primer and I finally found it I don't
know how that happened so I will zoom
you in well maybe I want I you just hate
zooming on this camera I'm so sorry guys
that's how much progress or that's how
much product I have left not a ton of
progress but again it's because I
haven't been using it because I thought
it was lost like and I was thinking in
my to myself like Maureen how do you
lose a primer like where does that just
crawl into but I didn't well I mean it
was lost but you know I don't know if
you can see them
it's barely any progress you really
don't need to see it so I'm really
hoping to kick it into high gear with
this use it every day I think there's a
potential to finish it so hopefully I
can the lip product I don't normally do
lip products but I decided to throw this
one in this is the tarte matte lip
surgence in exposed and i have made some
progress on it i'll show you guys how
much of product is left that's it it's
not a ton but it is a lot I feel like
for in a month especially for me that's
what it looks like in sight so there's
definitely a dip and that's the progress
on the container so not a ton my goal is
to work on this every single day use it
twice a day it is what I'm wearing on my
lips
now I do enjoy this product I just want
to see it gone I just want to see a lip
product that I actually really worked
hard on to be out of my collection so I
don't know I think if I really really
work hard it's possible but we'll see
yeah even if I get it like really close
I'll be really happy last product this
is eyeshadow from my Tarte aqua Lily's
palette I actually looked it up in the
color of the eyeshadow I am trying to
pan
it's called parasol so that is this
shade here if you can tell there's a lot
of texture in it I use it all the time
it's the face highlight I use it's my
inner corner highlight that's mostly how
I use it I don't really use it anyway
else sometimes on my lid but I really
just prefer it in those two areas you
can see it there just that it's very
dipped in I'm I definitely think I'll
hit pan on it that's my goal for it I'm
also making this a goal on my pan that
palette so it's kind of double reason
for me to really hit pan on this so I
really don't think I'll have a problem I
am excited about that one another
eyeshadow to hit pan on and that's my
update guys I really think I'll only do
one other update unless it makes some
really good progress in the next couple
of weeks I'll probably just do my finale
and just let you guys know where I ended
with these products for spring I hope
you guys enjoyed this update I know a
ton of you guys are doing this I've been
following along it's been great to see
your guys's progress as well and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
