finish seven by spring finale video I
started this challenge a little late so
this is actually my like update clash
finale video all in one I'm feel really
good about how I did in this project and
let's just get straight into the
products what I've used where I'm at
what's going on so the first item I want
to talk about is this one here by a
cover girl this is the nature luxe
foundation in the color flax I was here
when I started and I have completely
used it up it is all gone it did take a
while to use this product up because I
did use it in conjunction with the
tinted moisturizer I didn't use this
just on its own but it is gone now I
thought this was an okay product I got
lots of compliments on my skin when I
use this when I was at work it was like
every day someone was complimenting me
on my skin and I felt like seriously
who's paying these people to do this but
I mean I liked it for that but I don't
have any personal like attachment to it
so I'm not going to be trying to find
this one again it was nice I'm glad it's
gone it feels good to get a whole
foundation out just because it's liquid
and it feels like it's going bad every
second it sits in your drawer so this is
gone and that one's completely finished
up whoo I also used up this Tarte
colored clay liner in black I only had a
little bit of product on left on this I
want to say it was like this much
product or something so this was going
pretty fast in these group of items I
have since moved on to I think another
liner and like use that one up and then
another liner so I'm glad this is gone
I'm working on liners this year so this
is one out of the way I feel great about
that
and it's done the next group of items I
used up I counted as one these are too
many mascaras one Institute faced better
than sex mascara this one I didn't think
I would like it and I actually did enjoy
the enjoy this mascara and I think the
name just turned me off like I was just
gimmicky and not very good but this is a
great mascara I don't know if I would
repurchase it because it's expensive but
if I got another sample of it I would
definitely enjoy it and use it up and
then this one is the Laura Geller wow
factor mascara this
okay it was very dry just from the
beginning I wouldn't repurchase it it
was okay I used it up so these ones are
both gone yay so that is three items
down out of the seven so we're doing
well another item I used up is this
ultra flush powder foundation powder
powder it was just like a skin colored
powder I used this one up quite early on
i repressed it I'll leave the video I
used it was pretty pistol or cherishes
video of how sheer oppresses powders I
used that to repress this and I finished
it all up I did enjoy this powder toward
the end it was a very creamy powder so
it didn't look super keke on the face
but because of that I also felt like it
didn't control my oil very well so I'm
not gonna be trying to find these again
I got the stuff of all cosmetics
wholesale so I haven't seen them on the
site and I'm not worried about finding
it again but it is now out of my
collection so for down out of the seven
now this is where we're getting a little
dicey so I'll go into my other combo
item I have these of the - I had this
benefit fake up concealer this was just
a deluxe sized sample it is all gone I
didn't dig it out or anything because I
didn't like this concealer it is gone so
I finished half of that one up and then
this one was the covergirl and Olay one
and I'm telling you I am so close like
this has one use on it I didn't use it
today because I just filmed five product
face I am filming this video on the 18th
so this will be done by the 20th so I'm
going to be counting this as a finished
item because it will be done by then but
technically it's not done when I'm
filming this so hopefully that makes
sense I'm counting it I mean it'll be
gone so this is technically five items
out of seven that will be used up by the
20th I guess we'll go into this one then
I have this benefit Porefessional now I
was wear this pink line is it's really
kind of faded was when I started this
project and I I am right about here now
I really don't have much left on this
product but it's not going to be
finished in two days
it probably has another week left in it
if not a week and a half so it's a
little disappointing I know that if I
was wearing makeup on the days that I
went to school this item would have been
finished but I don't so that's just
where we're standing on that so I will
continue working on this I'm just going
to kind of put it like I'm still going
to use it every day and finish it up but
this one technically wasn't finished in
the time limit but it will be gone quite
soon so we're just going to keep working
on it and then this core is lip butter
and jasmine this is the last item this
is a seventh one and this was probably
the most disappointing product I made
some really good progress on this item I
did push it to the side just so I could
easily get in there but I think where I
made a mistake on this item to not
finish it up is that I used it at night
as a bomb like before I went to bed and
so I was using it everyday but I was
only using it once a day I wasn't using
it multiple times I wasn't reapplying
this product so I didn't move through it
as quickly as you would think you could
so for future things especially I'm
trying to work on a lip product in a
certain amount of time I'm gonna be
making sure I'm reapplying that product
because if I've used this twice the time
and reapplied you know once everyday
this would be gone right now so that's
gonna be just something for me to note
for other project pans if I'm really you
know dedicated on hitting that time
limit that's how I could have used this
up I'm just gonna keep using this the
way I have been using it I do really
enjoy this product I think it looks
great on the lips I like this product in
the daytime I just hate bring it with
you because it's in a tub so that's why
I decided to use it at night so it stay
sanitary but I'm not upset that I still
have this product because I do enjoy it
it's not like that I just wanted it to
be gone one and use it up so I'm just
gonna continue using this up I'm
basically just gonna add this into my
personal 20 project or 20 p.m. project
and hopefully have this finished in that
time frame that's just where I'm gonna
be adding it on or even my finish 5 by
Cinco DeMayo I just like add this guy on
but I'm still gonna be working on this
like it's in a project just to get it
out of Michael
and I can see the progress I know I'm
close so this will be gone soon
so that is my finale I feel really good
this is like my first project pan thing
that I've finished I used up a lot of
products I technically did use up seven
products just because I had those
doubles in there and I feel really good
about it especially because a lot of
these were full-sized
items that I got out of my collection
that I had either been working on for
awhile and just decided to finish him up
mostly that's what it is actually this
concealer was basically brand new when I
started and so that's awesome to really
focus in on this and get rid of it and
now it's gone I didn't enjoy it so I'm
glad it's gone and I feel really good I
feel pumped I think this is a great
beginning especially because this other
two are quite close or there's
definitely decent products so I will see
you guys in my next video I hope you're
having a great day let me know if you
guys have project finales for me to go
check out or anything like that I'd love
to see them and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
