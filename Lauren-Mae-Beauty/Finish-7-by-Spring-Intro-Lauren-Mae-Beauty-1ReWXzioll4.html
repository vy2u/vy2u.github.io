channel I'm super excited because I am
going to do a bunch of project pans I've
got the panning bug and I'm super
excited to use my collection purge stuff
get rid of stuff use it up get my
money's worth out of my collection
basically so I've decided to do the
finish seven by spring finished five by
Cinco DeMayo I also I'm gonna do like
just my own project pan with 20 items
and then I also have I think like two
more two that I want to do so brought
makeup products I want to use up by the
end of the year and then I have one just
separately for lip products I want to
use up by the end of the year so be
looking out for all those videos I know
it's a lot and I'm gonna be in a lot of
projects but I really I have way too
much makeup I love it all but I do have
a lot so I just want to make sure that
what I do have I'm loving and I'm using
and I really am getting my money's worth
out of my makeup this video is gonna be
my finish seven by spring video so even
though I'm starting late I'm just gonna
show you guys what I want to finish up
by spring I did pick items that I knew I
could finish up by spring since I'm you
know that's gonna be I believe everyone
saying it's March 20th yeah so that's
when this one will be done too but yeah
pink stuff that I knew I could finish
since this is like my first one I want
to make sure you know to stay positive
and use it up and then also I did look
up like the retail value of these items
so I can let you guys know what these
items are worth and then total out what
that is like how much makeup or you know
money I'm using out of my collection so
yeah let's just get started let's get
into these products first things this is
benefits Porefessional this is the 1.5
ounce so this one is the really really
big one I love this product um but I
just want to get it out of my collection
it's not like it's old or anything I
just know I could use it up and I do
want to get through a lot of primers if
you can see there it's all the way down
to here so this isn't something I'm
worried about using up I definitely will
it up and enjoy it by spring that one's
gonna be great and that's a $42 value
yeah it was this one here is you can't
really see it but this is the covergirl
nature luxe silk foundation this is in
the color 3:10 flax I've been wanting to
use this product up I'm really close you
can't tell because it's been on its side
but it's probably around right here this
product I believe is discontinued now so
you can only get it like random places
online it's not readily available so I
want to use this up and I do use this
product in conjunction with the tinted
moisturizer which is gonna be another
one in my pan projects this will take
still a little bit it's not like that'll
take me like a week to use up it's
pretty full coverage so I just you know
kind of dot this around face and then
rub it in with the tinted moisturizer to
give me the coverage I want I know I can
use this up my spring and I'll
definitely be happy when this product is
gone out of my collection I looked it up
on Walmart's website it said it was 974
if you were to order it I'm counting
these two together in one so this is the
benefits fake up concealer this actually
starts right here so there's a little
plastic nib on it this is just a really
small sample size this is in the light
shade I just have had this in my
collection I just want to use it up I
don't it's okay I've used it once today
like that's the only time I've used it
so I just want it out of my collection
is counted as a concealer in my
inventory so I can knock this one out
pretty easy and then just because that
one's too easy I'm also going to do this
one this is the covergirl and Olay
concealer bomb bomb and this one here
has that much product left it's
basically like full I haven't used a ton
of it but it's really not that much
product so I definitely feel like these
two I can use up and this one here
value-wise I couldn't find it honestly
so this one's gonna be I put in four
dollars because I'm gonna was selling
them on eBay for like I think eight for
two or something so I just spent about
four dollars this one here I looked it
up and I got a price of 798 on it
another face product this one is the
ultra flush it's just like a skin tone
powder
the self of all cosmetics wholesale it's
not on there anymore this is actually
the second one I've gone through I
ordered it again because I like to have
I don't have much left it's just on the
sides but it's it's pretty high on the
sides like I built I worked down the
middle but the sides are kind of big so
I'm gonna probably have to repress this
that's what everyone said so I'm gonna
look at that video on how to do that
just so it's easier to use because it's
like crumbling apart and I'm wasting
product so this product definitely isn't
my favorite anymore I am gonna be happy
to get rid of this product it doesn't
keep me matte all day long it's quite a
creamy powder if that makes sense so I
feel like it does get oily quite fast on
me I found this on Amazon for 1398
it was on sale so yeah that's the price
I put for it I have a liner I want to
use up this is the Tarte colored clay
liner in black this product only has
that much left I know it's not a lot of
it again some of these are kind of easy
but I just I only use this on my tight
line it's still gonna take me a little
bit of time but I did a makeup inventory
which I'm probably gonna post a video on
that and liners are insane I have like
almost 50 liners just pencil ones so I
want to work through a lot of those this
year you'll see them in a lot of my
project pans this one's almost done so
let's get it out of town I could not
find this online I got this in a set so
that's probably why but this I just put
it at $19 because most of tarts liners
if you were to buy them individually
would be $19 so I kind of made this one
a high-priced one but that's the best I
could do so $19 on that one I have
another item that I'm kind of counting
together so this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara mini and this is the
laura geller
wow factor mascara both of these are
kind of I've already been using them a
bit so that's what that one the brush on
that one looks like and then if you
haven't seen the Too Faced one it looks
like that so I have been using these
already for a while I'm I'm really bad
at knowing when mascaras are bad
I just use them nothing I use them until
they're like bone-dry I mean obviously
it's been like six months I'll get rid
of em I'm gonna use these until they're
goners and I count this as one and for
pricing this one is a third of the price
of the full-size one so this is eight
dollars in value and then the two-faced
one this one is like 62% that's how I
figured it out at least I hope my math
is right because I felt like this is a
really high price sample but this has
one point one seven ounces in it and the
original one or the full-size one has
0.2 seven ounces in it so this is 62% of
that and so price-wise this is a $14 and
26 cents sample which is amazing I think
you can't beat that you're trying it out
and you're getting over half of the
full-size so definitely wanna get my
money's worth out of these two and they
should be again super easy to use them
and then last but not least for my seven
items you just can't even see that it's
just being a hundred percent washed out
why is that happening anyway this is the
Korres lip butter and jasmine I have
used some of this up this is just an old
product I don't know if you can see in
there it's just an older product I want
to get rid of it I love this product
it's great it's it feels nice on the
lips it you know I love the color of it
everything about it's great I just want
to be able to get my money's worth out
of it before it goes bad that's our last
one this one is a $12 value retail value
those are all my products so I will
hopefully I'm probably only gonna do
like one update and then just like my
finale on this one just because it is
quite close but I definitely think I'm
gonna get through them I'm excited I
picked all makeup products so that's
gonna be like seven actually nine if you
count the two different ones so nine
makeup products out of my collection by
March 20th so super super excited for
that one and then yeah definitely stay
tuned for my other pan Biddy O's sorry
if you're sick of it but I'm into it so
I'll see you guys on my next video have
a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
