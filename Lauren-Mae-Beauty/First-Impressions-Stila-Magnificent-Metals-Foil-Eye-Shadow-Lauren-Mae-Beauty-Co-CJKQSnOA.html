video is going to be a first impressions
on steel is magnificent metal eyeshadow
this one is specifically in the color
metallic rose quartz I bought this
really recently and I put it in also
link that video down below but I really
wanted to try this out but I wanted to
do a first impression so that's what
this video is gonna be and yeah let's
see what it is I've already done my full
face of makeup and then I do have a base
on my eyes I'm just going for a really
simple look I want this which I guess
I'll show it to you that's what it looks
like I mean it's beautiful
I want this though to be the main focus
of the show so everything else is gonna
be kind of minimal I don't know let's
see let's see how it goes I'm gonna read
the instructions I haven't even done
that yet or anything it says for the
most sparkling results add one drop of
eye primer oh yeah okay I guess I'll
tell you what's in it so when you buy
this you get this whole big box which is
quite large compared to the actual eyes
shadow that you get and then inside
there you get the eye shadow you get
this little like mixing pan palette type
thing and then you also get these little
the little dropper and then this is the
liquid eye primer for the most sparkling
results add one drop of eye primer and a
small dab of eyeshadow to the mixing
tray and blend using SUEZ magnificent
metal silicon applicator which I don't
have or your fingertips gently apply the
mixture on lids blending it out with
soft strokes for a striking ultraman
metallic i'm sorry for striking ultra
metallic look blend with additional
layers of mix I don't have my glasses on
blend with additional layers or mix
multiple shades for Magnificent
multi-dimensional effect may also be
used along the lower lash line so we're
gonna just be like a mad scientist I
guess I'm going to take a little bit of
that on to the mixing plate and I'm just
using a brush I don't know what else to
do
oh it's blinking oh it flaked off of me
these are very um they're kind of like I
got I don't even know if that's gonna
make sense but there's like these rocks
that have these like
I feel looking flakes on them and you
can like flick them off that's what this
looks like I don't know anyway that's
how much product I put in there and then
I'm going to put one drop of the mixing
medium in there I hope this is enough
stuff for the actual whole eye shadow
pan I don't know if it is but that would
really suck if it wasn't um this is
definitely a very if you do the steps on
the back very long process just to get
some eye shadow
okay so mix with the primer it looks
basically the same but just liquid I
don't know I'm gonna be putting that on
to Milan where I'd normally apply it
just on the eyelid
I feel like it dries really fast too so
be careful I'm gonna use my finger since
I don't have the brush they said and
this isn't really working out for me I'm
going to apply it with my finger since
that's what it is
I'm gonna zoom you guys in so you can
see better - I'm trying to like pack it
on cuz I want it to be pretty dang
sparkly but necessarily liking oh it
looks
Oh No
okay that's what it looks like right
there um I feel like I don't know I'm
not sure how I like that it looks very
flaky like it looks like I have flakes
on my eye and it didn't turn into like a
liquid metal also I used quite a bit I
did use quite a bit of what was on my
pallet so I'm gonna have to mix some
more um to get that level of a pigness
on the lid good um okay I'm just gonna
do the other eye and then we'll go in
and like finish that maybe I'll like the
finished product or something better not
really sure I'm gonna try adding more
drops to this one to see if I can kind
of break down the foil enos of this or
what
okay it's getting all over
I look crazy
okay so that's what it looks like when
it's on I do have a little bit of
fallout like flakes are flying on my
lower lashline um so far I don't want to
say I don't like it because I'm gonna
finish the look and I feel like that
will help but it's definitely a tricky
product sorry I'm putting this away
it's a tricky product to apply so far I
mean I will say that I added more drops
with the second lid when I did this one
and I think that helped the product move
better plus I went straight in with my
finger instead of using the brush so I
feel like that primer didn't dry as fast
or I got it on my lids before it dried
and that helped move the products better
and make it more opaque but it's
definitely weird this is a weird we're
zoomed out I'm gonna be going in with
this brow product this is just something
I'm trying to use up for the year and
I'm gonna be using the light shade here
in my crease I just wonder too like if
these flakes are gonna flick off once
they dry and there's no liquid there if
they're gonna flake off on me in the
middle of the day like am I gonna come
home with all these flakes on my cheeks
because they dried I don't know it's
just hard to control the product too
since it isn't it doesn't turn into like
a complete liquid it's still very flaky
I feel like I can't control where the
flakes go they kind of like do their own
thing even now as I'm blending these out
I can like see the flakes like flying
across the air from me blending and I'm
like off my face I don't know man I feel
kind of crazy looking I mean in my last
video I'm wearing purple lips and I
don't feel as crazy as I feel like I
look right now
Flinx I could see this working for like
costume makeup if you're gonna do like
not even just on your eyes are like on
your skin if you're doing like a really
pretty ethereal look or like a mermaid
or something like there's a flake in my
little eyebrow oh my gosh
okay so I have a transition color I'm
gonna go in with the darkest color in
this palette that one there and I'm
gonna put that just on the outer corner
hopefully give some more definition and
I am gonna go in I usually don't do a
wing like every day but I thought for
this like it would look nice since I'm
not doing a huge like that much shadow I
guess I thought I would like ground the
look a little bit I'm gonna do that with
it like I can't even I was gonna wear
this out but I feel like seriously
insane so I just wanted like a little
bit of definition nothing too much
because you know we don't need it there
is fallout all over my face like you
could see it glittering on my nose under
my eyes it's crazy it's on a tight line
with this Smashbox eyeliner this
limitless one in onyx and then also on
my lower lash line use this Stila smudge
stick an Oscar fish and then I will be
raped okay so I actually went off screen
and did everything so my mascara on I
put the liquid liner on my upper lashes
I tight lined and I put a little bit of
liner on my bottom lashes and smudged it
out I just hate this I think it looks I
think from really far away it could look
nice but I just can't get over one
there's a ton of fallout which if you
know I did do my makeup first I you know
I guess I should have put this on first
and cleaned it up but there's just so
much and then I you know I have just
it's everywhere it's in my brows it's
all the way up here it's out here it's
under my tear duct it's on my cheeks it
was on my nose I I mean the fallout fell
all over my chest
it's everywhere and it's a wet pot mean
like we mixed it with the mixing medium
I feel like that should have stopped it
from flaking so much and just if it's
gonna flake this much now I can only
imagine throughout the day that it's
just gonna like flake off here and there
and the flakes break up into smaller and
smaller particles of shimmer so if you
try to like sweep it off you potentially
could break up that bigger chunk into a
bunch of smaller chunks and it's like
stays there if that makes sense I'm also
gonna zoom you in because this is like
probably the biggest breaking point for
me I don't know if you can see that
there but it looks like a crocodile skin
like what's going on in the inner corner
I think especially on this side you can
see how it's like clumped up and dried
all freaky and that is not cool to me
like that's not cool to me at all um
that's gross
I'm gonna zoom back up there's a lot of
zooming in this video so overall first
impressions I don't like this product I
especially don't like it because I don't
think it's worth the price it is it's
like a $32 product and for this to
happen it's just not my favorite I just
think there's better things out there
I'd rather try other things than this
because oh oh I'm so disappointed I
really wanted this to be cool it's just
flaky and gross and if you like shimmer
everywhere go for it girl but I just
feel like I can't get a precise
application I'd rather just deal with
regular glitter because I can at least
control that with glitter glue and
protect my face from fallout I feel like
this is just so flakey and weird so yeah
I don't suggest you buy it especially
because the price tag I mean if you
really want to go for it there are
probably ways you can make it work
better and I'm sure with practice you
can kind of master this a little bit
better but just ultimately that kind of
like crocodile skin look I can't that
alone right there is just it's not gonna
work for me so I will probably be using
this in my kit and during our fantasy
makeup class because
I can't imagine using it any other time
honestly I hope that was helpful I'm
sorry if you're disappointed but I'm
just as disappointed as you are I wish
it was better and I will see you guys in
my next video
