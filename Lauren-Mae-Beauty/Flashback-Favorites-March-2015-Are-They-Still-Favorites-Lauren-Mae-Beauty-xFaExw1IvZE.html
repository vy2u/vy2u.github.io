Lauren thank you so much for watching I
think the time has come where this
series is actually applicable for my
channel and that's a flashback favorites
type of video so I'm going to be going
back to my favourites videos of the past
and just going through those products
seeing if there's still things that I
like that I still use if I declutter
them how I feel about them now I
definitely have changed so much in the
last like almost three years since I
started my channel and just my outlook
on makeup
I've definitely just change I mean we
all change over time so I think it'll be
fun to go back and see if I'm wildly
different if things are still the same
if I still have some of those items so
I'm going back to my first ever
favorites video which I believe was in
March of 2015 I'm gonna leave the
original video link down below I
definitely have a higher-pitched voice
in that video don't know why it's
definitely early it's in my old
apartment here in LA we were only there
for like six months it's crazy so um but
anyway I mean the videos not that crazy
don't get me wrong it's just cuz it's me
and I have like all these memories and
like I sound like a different human but
I'm gonna leave it linked I know love
Heatherette does videos like this I know
Kristin Kay has done videos like this
and I know Courtney Kate here on YouTube
have done videos like this I'm gonna
leave them a link down below I don't
know who's like the original you know
person who started this idea so if there
is someone who's like the founder of
this I'd love to credit them if you know
it leave it in the comments but other
than that let's just get into my March
2015
flashback favorites so in that video my
first favorites that I mentioned are my
lorac Pro palette so I had the 1 and the
2 and I talked about how much I love
these and I still love these I think
these are amazing palettes in that video
I only had pan on the shade nude but I
have pan on white and cream now so there
you go you can see them now I think
these are great palettes I definitely
think that they were so different from
what was happening I just coughed a lot
so don't mind me dying I definitely
think that for when these came out
they're really great palettes and I
still think that they're great quality I
do suggest them this one's the lorac pro
2 I talked about how I love nectar and
mocha and rose a I have pan on two of
the shades here I
they're great I do keep these in my kit
at the moment and I use them very often
I love that there's a row of mats a row
of shimmers if you're someone who wants
like a nice basic neutral pairing of
shadows I do suggest these I think
they're really nice and I think you can
get a lot of wear out of them and a lot
of different looks and color
combinations since then I have picked up
the lorac Pro 3 and this is one I
actually really like as well looking at
it it definitely seems kind of basic I
mean a lot of the tones are very very
light but I find for my kit because I am
a pro makeup artist they work really
well to have all these different shades
for different skin tones and a lot of
the times when I'm working on people I'm
not doing glam looks I'm not doing
anything that needs to look like makeup
like I'm doing someone who's a character
and the makeup is just to make them look
done up or to help with their character
so if it's like a mom or just like a
regular high school student a lot of the
times you don't want them to look too
done up and they aren't experts at doing
their makeup and all of that so I find
that these pallets work really nice for
that I really enjoy them when I look at
the makeup landscape that is today there
are so many other palettes out there and
not that these ones aren't good and
don't stand up I just think there are a
lot of options and you have a lot of
different things to consider for
yourself when you're looking for a
palette so if you want to know about
formula these are great but there might
be a better palette out there that suits
your needs and wants more for your
makeup collection next I talked about
some single shadows which I no longer
have these are they still ozzie which I
called still arrazi in that video but
these are single pan eyeshadows if you
live in California you can get them at
friends they're very inexpensive and I
think they're great quality I just I
wasn't using them you guys know I have a
million single shadows and I kind of
don't like that they're in the bigger
pan these are in like eye makeup forever
type of pan and I don't know they just
one of them it cracked it was just time
for me to get rid of them for how much I
was using them and I was never
suggesting them because it's hard to get
them so oh my gosh if I see them one
more time I'm gonna go crazy so for me I
don't have them anymore I do suggest
them if you can get your hands on them
and you find colors that really speak to
you I don't think they're a must-have I
think they're inexpensive which is
awesome but that doesn't mean that
they're great and that doesn't mean you
need to buy them which is something
I've definitely learned over time next
in the favorites video I talk about a
foundation and that is the number seven
beautifully matte foundation now this is
a different tube and I have two of them
this is a really great foundation if
you're looking for something that's
going to be matte and like more full
coverage in the drugstore
I believe these retail for about like
thirteen to fifteen dollars and you can
get them at I think Target or Walgreens
I have the shade calico which I believe
is lighter than the shade that I talked
about in their cool vanilla both of
these have a very cool / almost gray
undertone to them which is something I
actually enjoy you can use something to
mix in with these to like warm them up
if you want to but I find a lot of a lot
of foundations look orange on me and
these ones definitely don't but even
with these so much has changed about how
I like to do my makeup since I was doing
my makeup back then I don't go for has
full or matte of a coverage as I used to
I like something with a more medium
sheer coverage something that even
throughout the day as it breaks down is
easy to touch up that I don't feel like
it's patching off my face and just like
getting gunky and weird I don't really
like to have too many layers on my skin
that being said this is still a great
foundation if you like a fuller coverage
and you want something that's foiled
controlling I still do use these and I
still think they're great I just don't
use them the same way I definitely don't
use as much of them and yeah I would
check it out if you were looking for
something it's a little bit pricey but I
feel like all foundations in the
drugstore are getting past that $10 mark
now so it's not like absolutely crazy
compared to other foundations in
different lines so I don't know if I'd
put it in a favorites video anymore
but I still think it's a good product
next I talked about two things that are
still absolute favorites I still
purchased I still recommend they're
amazing and that's the Beauty Blender
which I had not tried the Beauty Blender
out until basically I'd moved here to LA
I don't know what my problem was I just
thought there was like too much hype it
can't be that good and it is the beauty
blender is amazing I apply my concealer
with the Beauty Blender every single day
I also do like to apply a lot of
foundations with it although I have been
going back and forth between the Beauty
Blender and a brush lately the brush
just sometimes can
put as much product on my skin although
I love the finish of the Beautyblender
when it comes to blending out foundation
so it just depends on my mood and what
foundation I'm using but highly highly
recommend I know it's expensive
but it is really really good it's the
original it's what spawned all of these
countless knockoffs whether they're good
or bad it's all because of this guy so
highly suggest still really really love
it and then the other thing that I had
mentioned is the Beautyblender liquid
cleanser I think this is great I think
they just I'm pretty sure it was the
look of one I had mentioned this gets
out so many of your stains especially if
you actually stay up on cleaning your
sponge and don't wait a long time and
let that you know product build up this
can get your sponge basically brand new
and clean it doesn't change the texture
of your sponge I just highly suggest
this it just melts the product out it's
crazy
very very good I use this because I use
Beauty blenders in my kit and I want to
be sure that they are as clean as I can
get them and this does the job it's
amazing
I kept mentioning in the video that this
was like a short one which I'm like this
is a lot of products girl oh but the
last makeup item that I talked about is
from Tarina Tarantino and this is the
blush in the Apollo 10 I picked this up
at friends I think friends maybe nigel's
I think maybe I don't know but I picked
it up for sale at one of the makeup
stores here in LA I really love this I
think it's an amazing blush this is it
here it's very light it's just simple
and easy and it's something that even
though I've declared so much I still
keep because I love it it's a nice matte
finish but it doesn't look chalky or
anything like that I believe this is
discontinued and I think that's one of
the reasons I don't use it as much just
because I'm not the type of person who's
gonna get rid of a bunch of like limited
edition or discontinued things but it
does feel kind of crappy when you guys
can't get it and I love it so if you
somehow happened upon this I guess you
could get it but at this point too it's
kind of an older product so you know
just try to find a new nude blush is how
I feel anyway I still love this I
definitely still have it in my
collection and I enjoy using it and it's
something
that I don't have because I used it up
is the code Allah handcream and this was
like oh my gosh I remember loving that
product so much so this is something I
actually want to get again I'm going to
be making a video about like beauty
products that I get weirdly excited
about like I don't I don't know why I
love these products so much but that
will be coming at some point in the
future but this hand cream is amazing
it's going to go on my Sephora like
wishlist because I want to pick it up
again
I just love hand creams and this one
felt so nice on the skin
I loved the smell of it it was just a
great hand cream if you're looking for
one I think this one's nice I don't
think this one is like crazy cheap but
it's also not like $50 which I don't
know why hand cream would be that much
but anyway I definitely want to pick it
up I think it's great the ingredients
are great just so much about it is
amazing so yeah I definitely suggest
that products till and can't wait to try
it out again so those are all like the
products I talked about and then I had
also mentioned school I was still in
makeup school at the time I was filming
this video I was at some point of a
midterm I don't know if I was I think I
was either in my theater class or I was
in my high fashion class I can't
remember what I had said but I think I
graduated almost two years ago now so
it's kind of crazy
but yeah I think that's like a really
cool memory to have and then last I
talked about Dexter and how that I
actually called it an Hutton favorite
because I we had just finished watching
it and I did not like the ending of it
and it's funny because I almost forget
we've watched Dexter it's been so long
mixing so many shows in between then and
now I still don't like the ending of
that show now that it's been brought up
but um yeah it's definitely not like my
favorite show there's just so many of it
shows that I enjoy more than that show
anyway so those are my favorites I hope
you guys enjoyed the video
I can't wait to like get back to other
favorites and just kind of see what has
changed in my life it's really cool
that's something like so interesting
about YouTube is that as we film videos
obviously we're changing and evolving
people so what you say in the video
stays forever but your opinions can
change and differ as time goes on and so
then to revisit it it's like this weird
diary and you're like who was I or oh my
gosh yeah I remember
I love that product it's kind of a cool
thing to have so that's everything thank
you so so much for watching guys and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
