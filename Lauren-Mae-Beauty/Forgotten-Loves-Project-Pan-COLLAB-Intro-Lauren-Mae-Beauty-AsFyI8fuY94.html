learn thank you so much for watching
today I'm starting a new project pan and
this is actually a collab so I'm super
excited to talk to you guys about it
this is the forgotten loves project pan
I was asked to do this I believe Alex
and Draya they are the two that got us
together made this all happen so I'm
obviously linking everyone down below
but I want to say thank you so much to
them for inviting me into this collab
it's super fun so besides them we also
have LS in this collab we have cherish
or pretty pistol here and then we have
Janna
I highly recommend checking out all of
these women I've talked about a lot of
them before and I actually was
subscribed to all of them before we even
started this project which I thought was
really awesome so let's get into it
these are the Forgotten loves this is
going to be a relatively short project
pan we're starting this obviously on the
14th of February we're going to do an
update in a month and then after that in
a month we're gonna do the finale so
it's just a super simple short sweet
project pan and we decided that we're
going to theme this one to products that
we've forgotten about but without we
loved so we thought this would be a fun
way to get more use out of these
products and just remember why we love
them I have five products here to show
you and I'm not gonna waste any more
time let's get into it the first item
that I'm putting in here is a small
little palette from Smashbox this is the
Smashbox cover shock eye palette in a
blaze and I wanted to put this in here
because it's a palette that I think is
really beautiful I love how small and
handy it is the colors are really nice
but I tend to not reach for it for
whatever reason so I thought this
project would be a great way to reach
for it a little bit more so if you start
to see a bunch of warm toned eyeshadow
looks on my channel it's because of this
palette probably I don't know if I'm
gonna hit pan and anything in here I
really just want to use it more often
than I am currently that would be
success to me I just want to like fall
back in love with it and just kind of
get creative I might do a four looks one
palette I don't think I have with this
so maybe I'll do something like that to
just showcase the different looks I'm
coming up with but I want to just kind
of go outside my comfort zone
more than anything lately I've
really into like one channel over the I
kind of blended out and that's it so I
might do a lot of that with this palette
I'm gonna say that I took a little bit
of liberty with like the loved products
these might not be like Holy Grails but
they're products that I definitely enjoy
I'm not trying to use up anything that I
hate or it's things that I want to
hopefully find love out of so I don't
know I just wanted to pick some items
that are on my list for the year and
that I'm just kind of really wanting to
focus on getting out because I have new
stuff coming in anyway next this is the
Cokie smooth glow primer this is a
hydrating one I already have quite a bit
of this gone and I think that I can
definitely use this up in what February
to March March to April two months it's
only a two month project Wow yeah and
two months I think I could get this gone
if I use it everyday I have so many
primers coming in they're mostly all
deluxe sized samples but it's a lot and
I really want to use those so I think
it'll feel good to get a big primer out
even if I'm bringing in a bunch of money
so my goal is while I test those out
kind of I really want to get this gun
and I will have a haul on those items
coming soon I'm just waiting for a
couple more things I just want to say
really fast to thank you so much for all
of the love in my last couple of videos
I've been kind of away from YouTube this
weekend as much as I've like uploaded I
feel like quite a few videos and I
uploaded those two videos in a row I had
a friend in town and everything so I was
kind of like uploading but off doing
that and actually thanks for the love on
my hair pinned down that was really nice
I wanted to switch it up and I know you
guys always see my hair in a bun says
like alright I'm gonna like style it a
little bit and wear it down so um I
definitely feel a little bit more
confident to just like explore a little
bit I mean I love the bun but sometimes
it's nice to switch it up going back to
the project in the video we're talking
about the next item I have here is from
gorgeous cosmetics and this is a pressed
powder in shade number three and I just
want to see how much I can use of this
more than anything I want to see if this
is something I could love because I have
I mean I've used enough of it to hit pan
but I cannot remember what it's like I'm
so into loose powders right now I've
been using the Becca one a ton I have
that
maybelline one I just want my skin to be
perfect on its own without foundation
that's like my ultimate goal and I find
that I can just be more heavy-handed
with a pressed powder instead of a nice
like loose setting powder so I wanted to
see if this is something that I even
want to use up put it in this project
see how much progress I can make on it
and if I end up not even reaching for it
I probably am going to clutter it and if
I do like it I'll use it if I don't like
it you know we'll find that out so not a
past love I know I'm dumb but enough of
a love for me and hit pan a time
justifying that next I'm putting in a
product that was in my last project pan
and this is the urban decay illusion I
shadow this is from The Wizard of Oz
collection that came out the palette and
I love this so much I use it as a face
highlight I am wearing it today although
I have other things on top of it but I
love this highlight I already hit pan on
it last year and my goal is to finish it
up I'm not sure if I can do that within
this project I'm gonna try really hard
basically since that project ended at
the end of the year I kind of haven't
been using it much so I thought I would
bust it back out and just kind of like
get it gone I love it I'm gonna be sad
when it's gone actually but it'll feel
good to have an empty eyeshadow it's
crazy to me because if I finish this
eyeshadow I will have felt like that
palette buying the entire thing was
worth it because I used up the entire
product of one of the shadows that's
crazy it just makes you realize like
just how much product you get even when
I was doing this eye look which I will
have a palette bingo on it's probably up
already
I was thinking about that kat von d
palette and just how much product is in
there like I barely needed anything to
do the green on my lower lash line I'm
like it would take you forever to use
that green up like there's just no
freaking way
enough of the tangents I know the last
product in here this is the Revlon kiss
balm and I have mine in tropical coconut
I love this thing so much and this is
something that I have let kind of just I
don't know it's just in my drawer
instead of in my purse because the cap
tends to fall off but I really like the
and I want to use it more I mostly want
to get it gone because they do have a
peach one as well so I don't have a ton
of product I know I could definitely use
this up if I actually freaking try so
that is my goal I'm not good at using up
lip products they are a struggle for me
but I find if I actually put in lip
products that I'm i would normally
gravitate to like this I could use at
night I could use in the daytime I could
use it with a look like there are a lot
of ways to wear this whereas sometimes
like a red liquid lipstick there's no
way like oh I have a red liquid lipstick
it is literally so that I have it when I
want to wear it the five times on the B
gear that I'm going to and that's
everything guys I really hope you
enjoyed seeing the items I'm gonna work
on I'm excited to see what progress that
can make in the next few months
and I just want to say again thank you
so much to drea and Alex for inviting
you to do this project it's super fun I
do like collaborating and I really think
you guys will enjoy all of these ladies
