Lauren thank you so much for watching
today will be an update on my forgotten
loves project pan this is a cloud with
five other project painters I'm gonna
leave them link down below please go
check out their channel and I'm also
gonna leave the intro video if you want
to see where I started with these items
but I'm gonna keep this update pretty
short and sweet so I'm going to get into
my progress and what I'm thinking about
the items that I chose so let's get into
it I'm starting off with the best news
first because I'm so excited about the
progress that I made on this item this
is the Revlon kiss balm in the shade
tropical coconut and I have used about
half of this which is amazing I am so
excited for how much progress I have
look at this you guys that is amazing
progress especially for me and lip
products because those are definitely
hardest for me I really enjoy this lip
balm I think it's great I think these
retail for $4.99 now that's the price to
keep seeing on Ulta but it's funny
because when I first purchased these
they were more like almost in the nine
dollar range and I thought it was
expensive for a lip balm so I hope that
they've like just lowered their price on
things because my gosh but I do really
like this I would repurchase this I like
the way this feels on the lips it's a
nice mixture of not too like greasy and
slimy but not too thick or sticky or
anything so I love this I'm really happy
though to like get it gone I want to
work on the peach one and just keep my
lip balms fresh and the fact that this
is a lip product and I'm doing so well
on it I'm really happy with myself the
item that I probably have used the most
next to that one is the Smashbox of lace
palette if you've been watching a lot of
my tutorials or just videos where I've
been using eyeshadow in the video I have
been using this quite often I am wearing
it today I have this kind of as a
transition I have this as a transition
as well and then this all over the lid I
do really like this palette I think the
quality is really nice I don't think I'm
going to be hitting pan I'll show
progress pictures because I did take an
intro picture there's a tiny bit of a
dent going in this like nude shade but
other than that it's kind of hard to
make progress on this I'm not using it
every single day I realized that
just not really into panning eyeshadow
like it used to be I used to like want
to I made a whole video about like the
thousand eyeshadows I had and how like I
was like you know I was just into it
then and and I think I'm just more
inspired to use color than I ever have
been before I know you guys kind of seem
to know me as the person who wears a lot
of color in my videos I always have like
some bright color I'm doing something
adventurous with my eyeshadow but I
haven't always been like that I feel
like only in the last like a year or so
have I really been adventurous with
color and actually comfortable with
color and like it so I'm just letting
myself be inspired by all the different
eyeshadows that I have and all the
different looks I want to create in my
head and so panning eyeshadows doesn't
always work into that where I'm actually
using something every single day to hit
pan and to continue making progress on
those items at least visibly anyway a
tangent on that I am really happy with
this palette I'm glad I'm getting more
use out of it than I would and I would
be happy to hit pan on that that nude
shade but we'll see I'm not I'm not
really worried about it I'm going to
continue using this for the next month
to finish out this project and I will
hopefully get a four luxe one palette
filmed with this I am doing like a green
series right now where I'm doing four
looks with a green eyeshadow so I get
that film but I'll try to do that for
you guys sorry for all the tangents on
that one the next item I want to talk
about is from gorgeous cosmetics this is
the powder perfect pressed powder in
zero three I threw this in here because
I hadn't hit pan on it and I am wearing
two loose powders as of recently so I
just never use any of my pressed powders
and I did use it today but honestly I've
only used this like two times this whole
last month so that's not very good I'm
going to continue to try to use it for
the project I don't know how much
progress I'm gonna make on it I am gonna
try to force myself to use it more just
so I can at least get an opinion on it
but if I don't use this a significant
amount in the next month or I don't like
fall in love with this I will be passing
this on and then the last two items I
don't have a ton of progress on either
this is the coqui smooth glow hydrating
primer and I do
like this item I started up here at the
top of this black line and I probably am
down like a whole line but it's just not
that much progress the reason that both
of these items don't have a lot of
progress is because if I've gotten a lot
of these types of items into my
collection recently and so I'm just
excited to try those out and kind of
like didn't use this one so these kind
of just got put on the backburner but I
do want to try to make some good
progress in it so I'm gonna try really
really hard to use this at least four
times a week I think that will at least
get me some progress in it again I do
like this item there's nothing wrong
with it it I enjoy it it's nice
I just I'm excited to try other things
so I will hopefully kick that one into
gear and the last item here is from
Urban Decay it's an eyeshadow in the
shade illusion and it came with the
limited edition Wizard of Oz palette
I've just departed mine into a single
little compact I use this as a highlight
and again I've gotten a lot of
highlights in recently and so this has
just not been getting as much love I do
have some progress on it though I do
think the pan has expanded since the
last time I updated you which we will
see in the picture so there will be some
proof on that in a second but I do
really love this this is something that
I enjoy so much and yeah I'm not worried
about this I'm not upset to have this in
my collection for longer after this
project or anything and I wasn't
necessarily expecting to finish this up
entirely but yeah I am going to try to
use this as much as I possibly can in
the next month as well to hopefully just
you know finish this out a little bit
stronger than I started it alright so
that is my update it's not as exciting
as I really wanted it to be when I
started the project but I will say that
I am very happy with the lip product if
I would have placed a bet on where these
items would be I would have been
entirely wrong and basically the
opposite of what I thought would happen
happen but anyway let's end this update
thank you so much for watching guys and
please make sure to go check out the
other ladies go say hi to them support
them in their panning journey I cannot
wait to see their progress hopefully it
will inspire me to really start using
some of this stuff up that's everything
thank you guys I'll see you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
