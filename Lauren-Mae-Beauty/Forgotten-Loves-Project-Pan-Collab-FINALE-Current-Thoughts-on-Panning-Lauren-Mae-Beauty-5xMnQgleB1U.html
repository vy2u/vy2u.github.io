Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing my finale
for my forgotten love's project pan this
was a collab with five other ladies here
in YouTube we had drea CN we had Alex
from one beauty addict we had cherish
from pretty pistol 86 there was LS and
then Janna cookie so I'm gonna have
their channels obviously linked down
below definitely go show them some love
go see how they did in the project I
can't wait to see what their results
were we picked 5 different items and we
had the intro an update and then this is
the finale so the whole premise about
this project pan was to pick items in
your collection that you really loved
things that maybe don't get enough love
from you so you can like bust them back
out and we kind of all have different
goals when it comes to the product so
not everyone was trying to like use
something up entirely sometimes it was
just about getting more use out of the
products and that's something that I
really like about project panning is
just the focus aspect instead of having
to complete the product entirely but
anyway let's just get into the progress
so this can be a short and sweet finale
the first item I am so freakin pissed I
finished it it's gone but I don't know
where it is like it's literally gone as
in missing but I did finish up the lip
balm you guys I finished up the frickin
lip balm it is so hard for me to finish
up lip products I'm so bad at it
I just it's just difficult but that one
I actually used all the way up I hit the
plastic part in my update I had about
half of it gone from where I started and
I'm just so proud of myself for
finishing that up so as soon as I find
that product whatever I'm filming the
next video I'm going to be talking about
it and showing you guys in that video I
don't know when that'll be because I
don't know where it is I checked my car
I thought it was in my purse but it's
not in there like I don't know where I
put it and I have a lot of just products
I feel like everywhere right now it's
kind of been a little bit chaotic as
soon as I find it I will show you but I
did finish it up I just wish I could
show you that progress because I know
it's just so motivating but I can but
it's gone I'm really happy about that I
love that product I would definitely
repurchase it I do have quite a few lip
balms at the moment so I won't now but I
love it you guys have heard me talk
about it a million times it's like the
best coconut scented lip balm Sam loves
it he's like oh that's also good it does
it just smells so good some coconut
sides can be a little off but that one's
like perfect I'm gonna go to the item
with the next best progress this is the
urban decay eyeshadow an illusion and I
use this as a face highlight with my new
phones a camera I can just show you guys
this is where I'm at now so I am doing
so well I'm very very proud of that
please do not mind oh gosh don't mind
all my disgusting nails oh I'm gonna
drop the product you guys got to see
that up close how cute is that anyway I
really love this product and I'm really
excited that I have quite a bit of
progress on it I'm so close to being
done so I will for sure probably have
this done by the end of the year like
that's the goal I think I can do it I
really love the way this looks on my
face so I'm not like worried about using
this up or I mean if it didn't happen if
I didn't finish it by the end of the
year I wouldn't be upset but you know
it's just so close like why not just
move it out you know the next item I
want to talk about is a primer this is
the coqui smooth glow primer I really do
like this this is a bit of a
moisturizing a hydrating primer but it's
not like overly greasy feeling or
anything like that I just really do
enjoy it there's a little bit of
progress
I started up here this was a new line
and I'm just I'm barely below it I have
been using it a lot more but I also have
been using other primers and that's kind
of been the issue is that I'm not only
focusing on this I've been testing out
other products besides all that though I
will be working hard this year to get
this completely finished off before 2018
ends and I will enjoy it the entire time
because it's a good product the next
item that I have here is a little mini
palette I did put in the Smashbox ablaze
palette my goal on this was just to use
it more and I have been using it a ton
I'm wearing it on my eyes today along
with a cream shadow and I basically am
just using the same shades I normally do
so this is what it looks like let's see
I don't feel like you can see that much
different progress or anything in there
the biggest dip has been going in this
cream shade it's kind of like a peachy
cream I've been
guys but I know this is just like a
two-month project so it really shouldn't
be that big of a deal but I just get
bored easy and I want to be inspired by
my makeup products that's like the fun
of makeup to me and I definitely look at
it is like something artistic and it's
just I'm getting a little bored it's not
that I don't like this I'm just ready to
move on and not feel like I have to use
this or if I'm going for a warm shade I
have to use one of these colors so I do
like this palette it's definitely not
giving you like the most blinding
shimmery shades and for me my biggest
issue with it is that I don't have like
a really good transition like the light
shades to light and then the next matte
is too dark so I wish there was
something a little bit in-between for my
skin tone personally but I could see
these colors working for other skin
tones you know better it's just for me
what I would want from it so it's not
like a one and done palette for me but
it's good I do enjoy it I'm not gonna
like get rid of it and the last item
that I have here is my gorgeous
cosmetics powder and I haven't been
using this so this is going in my
declutter pile I really maybe use this
two or three times it's just not
something I like I've realized that I
have completely transitioned over into
loose powders they're what I prefer I
just like the way they look on the skin
better I also feel like this color was
just a little bit off it was too yellow
a little too dark I don't want to wait
for summer to come around for me to be
able to use this product up when again
it's not even in a loose powder format
so I will be passing this along and as
much as it's a little bit disappointing
to not have progress in it
I feel like declutter in it or deciding
and coming to the conclusion that this
item is no longer for me and then I'm
willing to part with it it's something
that is also a benefit of project
panning so it is still a success in my
eyes because it will be you know moving
on finding a new home and hopefully
someone else can use it up and enjoy
this product so that is my finale I will
say I'm a little like I wish I got a
little bit more progress I feel like
right now in my life with project
panning I feel like I'm just going more
toward I'm like hitting pan on stuff
like that it is enough of a success for
me and that's just where I'm at you know
like I feel like I've always wavered and
I'm always trying to find balance
between buying stuff and panning stuff I
don't want to
as obsessive about panning as I was at
the beginning of my channel because I
feel like it was almost like this
rebound from buying a ton of makeup -
then like switching my focus into just
using stuff up and I just don't want
makeup in general to have that much of a
hold on me like I just want to enjoy
products buy what I want not over buy
and just kind of be in that middle range
just kind of like feeling good but that
being said because I do get a lot of
different products from different
sources or if I'm interested in stuff or
for my makeup kit or whatever I do want
to make sure that I'm also using things
up and again striking that balance so I
mentioned in another video but I think
that I'm going to be doing kind of a I
don't know it's like a project pan but
just kind of like items that are close
to being done and kind of just focusing
in on them almost like my project use it
up but it will be with more makeup items
and see how that goes I just feel like
committing to like longer projects for
me lately has been really difficult
whereas I can be really passionate about
using something for like a month or
maybe a month and a half and then it
kind of dies out and I want to try new
things
but if I can kind of like make it a
rotating thing that might work or if I
can target specific items that might
only have a month or a month and a half
left of product in it I think that might
help me get through those items without
being bored I don't know anyway rambling
at the end sorry guys I hope you enjoyed
thank you so much for watching thank you
again to drea and to Alex for inviting
me in on this collab I really did enjoy
it I mean I know I'm like talking about
panning here at the end it's just
interesting to see how your thoughts
change as you as you grow and as you
change and you know where you're at in
different places how I've connected with
my makeup throughout the years has
changed so much and so yeah that's just
kind of like my current thoughts on
everything when it comes to panning but
thank you to them for inviting me on
this collab I'm really glad we did it it
was great to have some other ladies to
do the project with and yeah that's it
I'm glad it was short - it was nice to
just kind of like have a cute little
project pan and not something that
really dragged on anyway thank you so so
much for watching guys and I will see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
