haul I know I said I wasn't gonna buy
any products but my school tricked me
and won a filter up to friends beauty
supply so obviously I had to get some
stuff I did get a discount on the stuff
because I'm a student so depending on
the brand depending on the product you
get a certain discount off so I couldn't
say no my heart stopped I freaked out
all my classmates saw the true side of
me in that store and so since I did some
damage since I decided to go ahead and
do it i thought i would share what I got
with you I'm filming this video real
fast because I have an interview later
on so let's get this going one of the
first things I got were these shadows
now these are by the brand's still a
rosy it's like stila but Razi at the end
like paparazzi anyway I've never heard
of these shadows before they're the size
of like a makeup forever they're new
eyeshadows that's the size they are and
i bought these individually now they
price their shadows at three dollars and
if their mats and 350 if they're not and
i got forty percent off of that price so
it was just too good for me not to get
here are the shades again so if you guys
want like a full in-depth video on these
specifically just let me know but I did
kind of go with more warm tones um this
one that one there is like a stool
chrome color even though i have so many
of those i just couldn't pass it up and
i'm really enjoying this shade it's just
the perfect transition shade for me
that's light but still gives that tiny
bit of definition i love it but yeah
I've been using these last two times I
did my makeup and I really liked them if
you like the fallout on these like the
powder kicks up in the pan is very
minimal and for the price i think these
have been so amazing so far i'm pretty
sure i'll probably get some every time I
go to friends just because they're so
great but I've been loving to just these
like warm tone colors I know everyone
hates one crime but it kind of was
inspired by the Venus palette and that
grunge kind of warm toned look so I
I really have been liking these I don't
know I've never seen the brand before I
don't know if you can get them anywhere
else but i highly recommend them if you
see them plus they're cheap even just
for regular people if you don't have a
discount or anything three dollars and
350 is still wonderful pricing and it's
a big it's a huge shadow like the
shadows quite large definitely bigger
than like mac or make a peak or anything
just to let you know too they did come
in like a clear clamshell case so i had
to Z palette at home already and so um I
put them in there myself and then I had
to stick magnets to the back which they
were nice enough to give me magnets when
I purchased them and so that's how they
stick in there they don't automatically
stick in which is annoying to me but I'm
glad that they give those out
complimentary with them i also got two
tarina tarantino i think i'll tell you
sad um blushes these were sixty percent
off their originally $25 and I got them
for only ten this is the first shade
here this isn't Neapolitan Lane this the
shade is so beautiful like seriously I
can't believe I did my blush video oh
and then got this after I love this
blush so so much I've used it only twice
but just the way it applies the way it
looks on my cheeks they absolutely love
it i'm so glad i purchased this i got it
for only ten dollars when i was
originally 25 and totally totally worth
it it doesn't kick up any powder in the
pan oh the shade is so beautiful if you
see this discounted somewhere and you
like the type of shades that i like this
one is absolutely beautiful and you
should get it the other one I got is a
little more pink this is in the color
charm I really like this one as well it
is still neutral it just has that little
bit more pink I'm wearing both of them
today i'm wearing the neapolitan lane
like all over as a normal blush and this
one's just like a pop of color and the
actual like apple of the cheek just to
give it a little bit more color to my
face but i really love this one too
again $10 I couldn't I couldn't pass it
up I'm such an addict I just love it
love love love and i highly recommend
this one as well this one does kick up
powder though like when I put my brush
in it definitely way more powder than
that one I'm not like super big on that
but I just am noticing I like to notice
that with products but um yeah really
like this one as well I also got this
beauty so clean this is a
brush cleanser and I did not mean to get
this i meant to get um it's like a
sanitizer to spray on like powder
products to sanitize them and it's
better than alcohol it doesn't like dry
out your products but instead I got this
conditioner brush conditioner for
cleansing so that's annoying I do get
twenty percent off of this brand so I
will oh it says for professional use
only see a might not be able to get this
if you're not a professional um but yeah
I want to get the other one I guess I'll
let you know how this works but that
lame it's my fault I should have looked
better but I didn't I was too like in a
frenzy it was too much the rest of the
stuff that I got is all stila I got
forty percent off of steela products
which is amazing and I picked up some
stuff that I've been wanting from stila
for a while and just haven't I know been
inclined to actually like purchase like
I put them in my carpet in and buy them
so these are the things that I've been
really looking at at the brand so I
thought forty percent off you can't beat
it so the first thing I got it's like
rattling sorry this is the Stila
magnificent metals a foil finish
eyeshadow and this is in the color
metallic rose quartz this is a very
interesting product and I've heard
people talk about it um and I've heard
good things I've heard bad things it
just is so pretty I could not say no to
it so i probably will do a first
impressions or something with this just
because it's going to be interesting to
figure out how that product actually
works so we'll see i'll probably make a
video though another steal item that I
got is this palette and this is the mind
palette now these are all matte shades I
have the soul palette I think it's like
the most neutral one that has matte and
shimmer it's all brown tones I have that
I wear that for my wedding and I really
liked it and I thought I just had to get
it I especially love this
shade everyone loves that shade I just
saw this would be good to have all these
matte colors not that I don't already
have them but I've just been looking at
this palette and I wanted it and it was
forty percent also its original I 50 so
or 49 so I got for like twenty nine
thirty dollars and I just had to I'm
blinding you I just had to get it so i
did it and i love it and i'm so excited
to wear this and use it so the next
thing i got is this liquid lipstick from
stila in the color patina 03 I have
heard quite a few good things about
their liquid lipsticks from
kathleenlights and just other people
they love them liquid lipsticks are like
all the rage and then specifically this
color is like on trend as well so I just
wanted to like joining the bandwagon and
get it and I do really like it it's a
very pretty color it is a very
long-lasting when I put on my hand and
swatch did it did not come off or super
long time even like after washing my
hands with soap and water so I'm excited
to wear this one and try it out and I
probably will go back for really like
this and get just a couple more colors
this is $22 and i got it for 1320 or
something with the discount I think
that's a great price and these are great
to have around especially in like like a
red or a dark color because they stay so
nicely on the lips and they're just
hassle-free since you don't touch them
up you don't worry about transferring
about like hair getting on your lips or
anything like that so I love that and
then the last product so it's not too
bad right um the last product is an
eyeliner and I did not realize until I
got home that Lauren you about an
eyeliner Lauren you bought an eyeliner
but oh I kind of resist this one is so
pretty this is like a mint colored liner
and I'm telling you when you watch this
it is actually mint it's not like
something you have to build up it's just
so beautiful and so unique I haven't
seen a ton of brands have this and I
just love it um it's just great I love
it and I'm excited to use this I could
use this in the look that meant in
copper look I could have used this on
the water line instead of blowing down
that white
bass I could just use this and it would
like totally eliminate the step of
torture powder on the waterline it just
would have been wonderful so I'm excited
to have this although i bought a liner I
totally bought a liner I guess I will
swatch this for you to really fast just
you guys can have an idea i wasn't going
to swatch too much because i am trying
to kind of get out of here but that is
the color it's so pretty it's just
beautiful so um but yeah that was like
my experience friends the beauty supply
it was so beautiful inside I mean it's
not like it's super fancy but it's just
so much makeup there's so many different
brands and it's just a great place that
you can go shopping and get everything
you need all at one place you can get
supplies you can get actual makeup you
can get special effects stuff it was
awesome I had loved it it was totally
the store for me the store for me love
at first sight but anyway I just want to
get on really really fast I gotta go and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
