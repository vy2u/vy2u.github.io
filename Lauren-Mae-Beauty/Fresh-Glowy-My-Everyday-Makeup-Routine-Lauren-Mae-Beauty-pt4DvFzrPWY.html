long and thanks so much for watching I
have found a new makeup routine that
I've really been enjoying so I thought I
would just show you guys my everyday
makeup routine I'm mainly focusing on
the foundation for this and the way the
skin looks but I'm also going to show
you just like basically my easy everyday
if I'm not feeling inspired or I don't
have a ton of time to get ready this is
what I do yeah we'll just get into it I
do want to talk about skincare first
because I feel like since we are going
to let the skin show a little bit more
we definitely want it to be hydrated and
I think something that's really
important is just kind of coming to
terms like we all have skin and no one's
is 100% perfect and it's okay to let
that skin show through and you can still
be beautiful you can still wear your
full coverage if that's what you're into
I know that I in the past have really
loved full coverage but just right now I
just I don't want to feel like I have so
much on my face and it looks fine at the
beginning of the day but what I really
enjoy about this routine is that by the
end of the day I might be more oily but
I'm able to fix the oil and control the
oil easier while my skin still looks
great instead of it being maybe not
quite as oily but it's just looking more
caked up it's separating I feel like I
have a lot of foundation on so that's
one of my favorite things about this
routine
anyway I'll show you guys what I used on
my skin for just skin care now I'm not a
huge skincare person I don't have a ton
of serums and all these things but I do
try to at least do a minimum of like
moisturizing and like an eye cream so
first when I got out of the shower I put
on me Mac prep and prime this is to 6
plus in the coconuts and I'm trying to
just use this up but I do like this as
just like a facial hydration spray after
that I went in with a moisturizer this
is the olay regenerist micro-sculpting
cream with sunscreen it has an SPF of 30
I bought these a long time ago at Costco
and a double pack the more units the
more I do really like it and it have
been enjoying it I like that has
sunscreen in it as well Suns really good
at least for now and then for my eye
cream
I am using the embryo lease it's on
French soothing eye contour care this is
just something I picked up at one of the
beauty stores here I needed a new eye
cream and I didn't want to pay attended
leave 4:35 I just get a little bit of a
discount on it but so far I have been
really liking it I use it day and night
it doesn't have a ton of like you know
anti-aging properties but for me the
most important thing is just moisture
and making sure the under eye is
moisturize that's not only going to keep
it looking younger longer but it's going
to prep the skin so that way you can put
on concealer easier the more moisturize
your skin is the more product you can
put on the face while it still looks
natural and nice it's not everything a
different skin care I know I talked to
skin care it's not like bigger the times
but next day I'm going to prime in the
face this is something I'm just using up
because it is the regular Smashbox photo
finish primer obviously I've cut mine
open so I can get to the very end of
everything in here this one is not like
control oil it's just like an overall
primer to kind of smooth the face and
prep it for foundation I really like
this especially in my kit I think that
it just helps so much for people
foundation to go on smoother and
honestly a lot of the times when I'm
doing makeup for people they're not
wearing it for a full day like a 12-hour
day they're wearing it for interview or
they're wearing it I don't know to a
party at night or whatever and I'm there
to touch them up so I think it just
works really nice and makes their skin
with the best it can for what I need it
to I do think I'm going to repurchase
this for my kids now that I spry my face
I'm going to go in with Foundation and
this is the foundation that I've just
been loving this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation I use the shade 117
or y2 25 I am in love with this
foundation it's still weird because I
bought this foundation if you've been
asking a wild I want to say not last
Christmas was basically the Christmas
before and I didn't really like it I did
have a ton of breakouts at the time and
this is more of a medium coverage
foundation you can build it up a little
bit but it's definitely meant to look
like seamless on the skin you're not
supposed to see that you're wearing
foundation this is just so good I've
recently bought some of these colors for
my kit
and I cannot wait to have a bigger range
of them this is just perfect for any
type of makeup it will make you more
oily it's not going to be like
mattifying or oil controlling but again
I feel like it just gives such a nice
skin like finish so anyway I used three
pumps of this I could use more but I
find that three pumps definitely covers
my whole things and if I use more I tend
to just kind of go in the same areas
over and over and I'm just kind of like
building up coverage when I shouldn't be
so I'm going to smooth this all over the
face and I will
I just want to show you guys what one
side looks like so I've obviously done
this side of my face and in comparison
it looks definitely more flawless but up
close and in person and without all the
studio like so now these are students
but lights that I have going on you know
I know it looks more perfect but you can
see still resonance it still looks like
my skin it just there's nothing that
just sticks out you know like I had very
red cheek but you don't see that in this
one it's just a slightly more perfected
so I'm I just I love it I'm so obsessed
guys it's so weird to how your kids
change over time and honestly this just
looks so good on everyone I use it on I
think what I love about it the most is
that it gives me coverage while not
building up texture on the skin so if
you needs a really heavy foundation even
if it doesn't give like a ton of
coverage but it's just a heavier
foundation you're going to see that that
product is on the skin and I just love
how this truly does look like skin it
looks so good
so after I get everything on the skin
I'm just going to use whatever is left
on my hand which isn't a ton but I just
go over my nose which tends to be more
of a problem area my chin and my cheek
area and then I just finished blending
it into the face and you can see with
the lights how it's definitely more
glowy so next I'm going to go with a
concealer the one I'm using here is from
Eden minerals what I really like about
this is that it's a more sheer concealer
this is not going to give you full
coverage it's not going to kick up
underneath the eye it's basically just
like another layer of what the
foundation is but I really try to keep
this only in mario's I really wanted
mostly I need extra coverage under my
eyes I just like a little bit of
something brighter and this does that
for me
I really feel like any pen or clipped up
concealer that was going to give you
that really fresh shape is going to give
you a little bit of extra coverage but
again we're not going for perfect like
that's not the goal of this whole thing
so think anything like the Wisel to
shake law or anything like that it's
going to do this so I'm going to pump up
some
and I'm just going to ping it a little
bit under my eyes and you can tell that
this is quite a brightening product and
then I also sometimes will take whatever
is left in the pen and go over any
problem areas that just are slightly
more red than maybe I want them to be
and just see if this can be the final
the final thing that covers them up but
again it's not a ton of product and
we're just going to blend that out and I
really like to make sure I blend it out
under the eye so that way I don't get
any collection of product in my fine
lines right under my eyes now that we've
done the face I want to set that so I
just like to use a translucent loose
powder this is the been denied
nucleoside a classic I don't like to
powder my face like I used to I used to
like get a flat brush and like digging
into powder and then like Pat it in and
I still kind of do more like patting
sweeping motions but I definitely don't
pack it on nearly as heavy as I used to
and I really feel like that helps with
my foundation throughout the day like it
does control my own kind of sets my
foundation but I don't have the same
issues I used to have with products just
breaking down and looking patchy where
it's like basically the oil and the
foundation and the powder of all mixed
together and it's just disgusting and
cakey and I can't handle it anymore
anyway so I just dump them out on my
hand and I'm just going in with this elf
brush which I really been liking this is
the blush brush and I sent under the
eyes first I taught my brush into the
product and kind of work it in so that
way it's not all on like the top
bristles of the brush and then I will
kind of do this and dust it off so that
way I'm not getting too much product and
I concentrate the most powder in my
t-zone and under my eyes just because I
want to set my concealer and I also
to try to control the oils in my t-zone
as much as possible and then for the
rest of the face I still use powder but
I don't use as much I guess as those
areas I kind of am more swiping with it
instead of padding so as you can tell by
setting my face there isn't as much of a
shine to it but I don't feel cakey and
also mad I don't feel like I have a ton
of products on my face and I don't see
the texture of what all those products
would have looked like if they were
heavy and thick so like I mentioned
before in my last get ready with me
which some of this is similar to it but
this is supposed to be a little bit more
educational wears out when I was just
kind of like talking about what I wanted
to and trying out new products anyway I
like to let my skin just kind of sit
with that product on panel to powder
keep into the skin and kind of have the
mills a little bit more before I go in
with my bronzer blush highlighter and
what not so I'm going to do my eyebrows
y'all know I love this elf pencil this
is the elf brow pencil in taupe and I
love these I probably gone through eight
of them maybe and guess what 89 is only
16 dollars less than a non-soviet pencil
I know it's crazy anyway I like to brush
my brows out with a spoolie because I
just go over them with Foundation and
everything I just try to lightly sketch
a brow shape on my brows are by no means
perfect I feel like one of them always
is more arched than the other I just try
my best so I am going to draw on my
brows and I will be back
Oh
those are eyebrows done
sometimes Pacific feel like the front
portions a little harsh I'll take my
Beauty Blender and kind of just come
over with any extra foundation I might
have just to kind of like make the
friend not look so harsh but this brow I
have to extend further than this brow
because of the way my hair naturally
grows so that kind of sucks and then
once I'm at a place where I feel
comfortable with how my brows look I
lately have been using a tinted brow gel
I'm going to be using the sourcils
styler from Lancome I did receive this
from octa Lee I've been really liking it
I've tried a ton of different ones like
this but I really like ones with a
smaller brush and I like to take them
and brush up the hairs especially in the
front this is going to lock my brows in
place but it also just kind of gives my
brows a more realistic feeling I really
kind of like that look of the broad like
I don't know pushed up in the front
almost a little like werewolf II or just
kind of natural I do that to both my
brows and this is probably the biggest
change I've made to my brow routine I
feel like it just helps give them not so
polish of a look it makes them look more
real especially for me when I have
really blonde eyebrows it kind of coats
each hair and makes them look more
defined next big one for eyes I'm going
to be using just an eye primer you can
use any one you have this one it's from
lorac I barely have any left so it's
hard to squeeze out I always prime my
eyelids again like I said I'm very oily
so this inner step I really can you know
not do if you aren't oily and you just
want some coverage just go over that
area with your foundation and or
concealer and you would need to prime
but that doesn't work for me my eyes
will just crease for eyeshadow I like to
keep it pretty simple I'm not really big
I like my lashes to stand out but I
don't really need a ton of like shadow
on the lid every day all right I go back
and forth I change my might all the time
but these are the ones we're going to be
working with today they happen to all be
Mac's but you can use whatever you want
or whatever similar or
your favorite colors so I'm going to
take a big fluffy brush and go into
vanilla and I'm just setting my primer
and I set my whole lid from brow bone to
lash line I just like the way that this
like brightens the lid as well as again
setting that primer next I'm going to go
with my 8:40 and the color soft brown
again for Mac and I'm just going to buff
this into my crease I find that with Mac
shadows it's best to like build up
slowly instead of like really dipping
your brush in I'm not sure how I feel
about Mac shadows I like them and I
don't it's like a love-hate relationship
sometimes I'm really into them sometimes
I am totally not but I do think soft
Brown is a really pretty color and if
you're looking for shadows that are
going to last you forever Mac is
definitely going to go now a lot of days
I would stop there but if I want a
little bit more definition I go in with
antiques from Mac I just keep that on
the outer portion of my eyes looking for
a fresh sorry guys and y'all know I love
this one from colour-pop and I just dig
it in there and then I like to really
tap off the products as I find this one
gives a lot of Fallout and I just keep
it on the outer portion of the eye and
just sweep it in and that's it for the
eyes at least on the top part of the lid
I will sometimes go in with my Urban
Decay electric palette and the color
savage here and like put pink into my
upper part of my brows I'm not going to
do that today sometimes I will just do
this and maybe put just soft brown in
the crease I don't know it's just to
make sure of those today I'm not going
to put pink I just don't feel like this
a nice let's go on with liners you guys
know that I only like to type mine I
don't put actual liner on my top lid
because I do have more hooded eyes and I
tend to lose a lot of lip space when I
do that so this defines my eyes and
gives my lashes a nice base without
losing eyelid space this is probably one
of my favorite eyeliners I've ever used
this is from pop beauty in it's the
color bronze bonanza I've used this for
almost a year now I feel like I really
like this warm toned bronze color on my
eyes it really brings out the blue I
just really enjoy it so I'm going to
tightline noses and then I am going to
run a little bit under
on the lower lashline not in the water
line just on where the lashes grow and
I'm going to use this punch and send it
out I like to keep it on the outer
portion of the eye and not bring it too
far into the inner corner and then
usually I go in with a white whiner as
well this one's just from Stila but you
can use any white liner that works for
you I don't recommend enabling one and I
just like to put that on the waterline
it just really brightens up the eyes
they keeps my face and my look looking
really fresh and that's what I like now
going back into the shadows I'm going to
take soft brown and I'm just going to
run that on an angled brush underneath
the eye and kind of blend out so why now
we sit down there I like to keep it
pretty soft on the bottom lashline
nothing too harsh and nothing too much
like a line I'd rather look more blended
now we're ready for the base product I'm
going on with my butter bronzer I also
have them using the wet and wild golden
light just base powder a lot lately but
that one's a little bit more yellow this
is a little less harsh I like both of
them it's what I'm trying to say I like
to hit the temples because I'm losing my
hair so I feel like it helps with that
and then I just do a little bit on the
cheek where you would contour and the
goal of this isn't to like contour the
face this is just to give the face a
little bit more life to add some color I
have a little bit of definition going on
but it's not a contour and I I think
that's something like you know you don't
have to come to her every single day
it's okay to just bring a little bit of
life some dimension to the face that's
going to give you a really nice like
healthy glow without looking like really
harsh like you're going to the club I
belong I'm not the biggest fan of a
really harsh contour for blush I like to
keep it pretty light and natural I'm
going to go in with the Laura Keller
because I just feel like her blushes are
like the epitome of that and you guys
know I love it so this one is in traffic
hues it's a really nice like peachy
shimmery shade she also does have some
blushes that are matte so if you want
something that you could do that as well
but I just like something a little bit
more sheer a little bit more natural to
the skin for a nice flush and then you
guys know how I feel about high
I'm going to be going in with the
essence pure nude highlighter I really
like this this is actually more intense
and I feel like people try to act like
it is I think people are so you still
look like having metal on their cheeks
that you know this seems like nothing
but this is pretty intense for me I do
like to have a nice glow especially on
the nose at the tip of it and on the
Cupid's bow I like to go about the
eyebrows and on the chin and that's the
face so we are back onto the eyes I'm
going to finish up the eyes using a
mascara this is from Eden mineral and
it's the ultimate volume buildable care
mascara since I've used up the pure
fully-charged
I moved on to this and I really do like
it you can get give me a nice volume and
separation the more ease the more I like
it and it's really black that is
something that is like the biggest thing
with this is it's pretty dang black so
that's the mascara John something I
forgot to show you guys though is
usually I will take whatever highlighter
I'm using and I'll take a pencil brush
and I'll just put that in the inner
corner as my highlight unless I have a
palette that has a different highlight
shade in it that I'm using I like to
just keep it all the same so next and
the last thing we have to do is lips a
lot of times honestly I will leave the
house like this I just well I don't know
I just I kind of like the way this looks
I guess or I don't find a huge issue
with it
but sometimes I'll just do a lip balm
sometimes we'll do a lip gloss so if you
really want to know like what some of my
favorite lip products are I will leave
that video link down below today though
I'm going to go in with the Revlon HD
dawn HD lipstick I don't really know
it's nice and sheer gives me a little
bit of color it's not matte though it
has like just a little bit of a sheen to
it and it's really comfortable um it
also has a nice like tropical scent to
it which I actually enjoy okay guys
enough everything that is my current
like everyday foundation and everything
routine I hope you did enjoy to help
this like helped give you any pointers
it's just really simple I can do this
pretty fast and I like that I feel just
like confident in this I really like
that it's less product than I'm used to
wearing and I really like how it wears
out the day again I do get oily I tend
to go in throughout the day with a
blotting sheet or just
a little bit of powder in my t-zone but
what I really like is when I'm wearing
my glasses and I need to like Pat that
product out I'm not like ruining my
foundation throughout the day so okay
guys let me know any of your favorite
products for like a more natural look or
that worked really well I'd love to know
what your guys's tips and tricks are in
secret products and that's everything I
will see you in my next video thanks so
much for watching guys all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
