lauren i have been a new location I'm
just filming from a different angle
today I have my like monitor over here
so I'm sorry if I keep looking up I just
am not used to filming here this is all
just natural lighting so let me know how
you like it I just hit board I really do
I like to switch it up and I feel like
with working and everything I just
haven't been as inspired to film so I
thought changing up the location would
be a good idea so today Z is super
exciting i've never done something like
this I believe people call something
like this a friend hall and let me grab
it it's over here I got sent a package
from autumn more here on YouTube for
user name is autumn or oh aight i'll
have her link down below for her channel
definitely go check her out and
subscribe to her she come to know one of
my videos a long time ago when I was
talking about my temptations and she was
like hey I have the butter bronzer if
you want it I'll send it to you and I
was like oh my gosh that would be
absolutely amazing like that's so sweet
of you so she sent me that along with
way too many other things super sweet of
her it was like Christmas when this came
I was so so excited so I want to say
thank you and i will also have her
Instagram link down below so again
definitely go check her out I think
she's really funny on Instagram and
stuff and she has like really good taste
in makeup I feel like she's a nice
reminder of people who project pan but
aren't gonna just like pan something
they absolutely hate and it's like yeah
you're right life is too short for that
I really like that about her so anyway
let me just get into the items she sent
me I thought I would just show you guys
and do like a haul video of it why not
I'm really excited for like everything
basically in here of course we're going
to start off with the butter bronzer
this is from physicians formula I heard
a few of you guys say that you guys
can't get this anymore so I'm really
sorry it must not be in store I don't
know I guess it's limited edition I
really like this i am wearing it today
on my face i think it's really nice i'm
super excited to have it it's very
buttery and the color is just very light
nothing too stark and that's really nice
it's something i really like so i really
like this like everyone says it does
smell nice but like it smells good but
it has this like understand that I don't
like like I smell it initially
it smells good and then it's like it
changes but overall I don't think I hate
it we'll see as I use it right but not
like disappointed but kind of on that
like I just wish I wish you'd just
stayed the good smelling scent that I
smell originally but anyway I'm so
excited to have this this is something i
was really wanting another item that was
super exciting to me was the laura
geller blush this is in the color pink
grapefruit if you guys have seen my
blush collection video you guys know
that i absolutely love laura geller
blushes so this is gonna be like the
fourth one in my collection now just a
great everyday type of color I'm really
excited to add this to my collection and
to get use out of this she also sent
over to other blush type of products
this is the number seven blush and this
is in the color number two honey so
pretty I really like this this is
something i don't think i would ever
pick up if I was just like in the store
but it's just a nice it's up here I'm a
little washed out so I'm sorry I'm
really close to the window right now
this is like a really nice like natural
tarde exposed type of blush but a little
bit more like peachy or warmer so I'm
excited to try that out and then the
other one was the Maybelline master
highlight and I've heard so many people
talk about these I've never tried them
myself so something just fun and new
again something I want to pick up it's
kind of fun when people send you stuff
cuz it's not necessarily Stephanie what
about yourself or you probably would
already have it in your collection there
were a ton of single eyeshadows I'm
gonna actually put these in a palette
really fast and I'll be right back that
way I can just show you them easy so
those are all the shades once I got them
out of the packaging I was watching some
of these they're really smooth for the
most part that's a couple in her little
like I feel like gritty but the
pigmentation still nice they're really
awesome i'm excited specifically oh yeah
don't mind this crap i don't even know
how that happened to this palette but
i'm really excited for kind of like
these colors especially like this one
here it just reminds me of like makeup
geek i think it's called shark bait or
something yeah i just think these are
really nice i'm excited to play around
with them and try them she sent over to
other like single shadows this first one
here is from sonia kashuk
this is in the color night it's just
like a matte color and I've never really
had I don't think any sign of Kashuk
stuff but that's what it looks like
really nice it's like a great kind of
color I thought this would be actually
really pretty paired with the other
single this is anya from Illamasqua I
don't know who I heard talk about this
probably Nikki tutorials actually really
pretty powder blue color it's super
pigmented it seems like it'll be chalky
but I feel like it's watches better than
you would expect I'm excited I thought
that would be a kind of a pretty
tutorial or something with like a gray
blue I there were also a ton of
eyeliners in there and although I am
working through my eyeliners it was just
refreshing to see other eyeliners
besides the Urban Decay I have so many
freaking Urban Decay liners and I'm not
trying to sound like stuck up or
whatever it's just it's a lot of one
brand it's a little boring and the
formula honestly is not my favorite I
don't think that it is as long wearing
as it should be and you can put it on
your hand and swatch it and it stays
forever but if you put it on the tight
line or the waterline I really don't
think that it has as good staying powers
you would expect so anyway these four
liners here the one that I was most
excited for was nars and this is the
larger than life long-wear eyeliner
Andrew Bonaparte I think it's how you
said this is just like a nude eyeliner
and wearing it today and I only have one
nude eyeliner and I actually have it in
my kid so I'm excited to have one for
myself this is like a double-ended liner
this also has a nude one on it and this
one is in the brand studio 10 I believe
one of them is like a brown type of
color and then the other one again is
nude these are all super creamy too so
it's just nice again to try out
different things that I feel like so far
have the same texture as the urban decay
or a comparable texture so I'm just
excited to try these it's just exciting
to get new makeup frame I have a pop
beauty one this is more like a bronze
color there's that I'm also wearing this
one today on my tight line and also on
my lower lash line oh and this is not a
this is actually not an eyeliner this is
the lip pencil it's from laura geller
again I really like that brand this I
put on today and it is a really long
wearing lip pencil it's kind of like I
feel like we make it forever once or the
by Terry ones so it's definitely gonna
stay on all day
and I wore this earlier today or this
and the other lip product I was super
excited to see in here this is from
buxom and this is there like nude
collection so it's different than the
other bucks and pencils that I really
like this isn't the shade undressed
that's it there it's kind of like a
really peachy almost brownie peachy nude
and I wore it with the lip liner it
looked nice definitely a little bit out
of my comfort zone but I am excited for
those two and to get you said of this
like I really like buxom pencil so this
is also really exciting for me I'm like
running out of room to swatch stuff I
have an eyebrow like dual ended a pencil
this is from the brand billion dollar
brows which is pretty pricey I feel like
we used to sell this on my old store
there's like a matte cream color and
then a shimmery type of highlighting
color on here so that is nice and I do
usually like like those cream sticks to
like highlight right underneath the brow
bone I happen the Lonnie one I think
right now and I haven't really been
using it I probably should use one of
them the rest are all lipsticks so I'm
just going to run through i'm not going
to do swatches or anything the first one
hears from Estee Lauder and this one's
in the color dangerous so that's what
that one looks like it's like a brown
nude color this is revlon's black cherry
I felt like a lot of these would be
really good for fall this is another one
from Revlon this is raspberry but she
sent over max rebel which I'm excited to
try out I don't really have any mac
lipsticks so that's exciting in the last
two lipsticks although i found one other
thing in there after these i don't know
what brand these are i'm not sure of the
brand on these ones but one is in the
color fig and the other one is in the
color baby kiss so this one's baby kiss
and then this one here is the color fig
just some fun new makeup to try out the
last actual last melon here this is the
Maybelline master conceal by face studio
it's in the color light it's a concealer
I really am excited to try this I don't
have a lot of concealers and the one I
do have right now I absolutely hate so
much it's from covergirl they were out
of Maybelline fit me so I just had to
get something because I was
completely out and I freaking hate it so
much it's like disgusting so hopefully I
like this and I can get you set up this
one that is everything thank you so much
again autumn I really appreciate it and
I just thought I let's share with you
some new goodies that I got sent so fun
and that's everything for this video I
will see you guys in my next one bye
