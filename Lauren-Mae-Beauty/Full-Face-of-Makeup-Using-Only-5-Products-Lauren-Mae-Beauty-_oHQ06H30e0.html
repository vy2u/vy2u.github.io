learn thank you so much for watching
today we're in a new spot I've tried to
set up a different setup I don't know
how it looks I did my best I took a lot
of time trying to figure out how to make
this little corner because this is the
corner look the best that it can I was
just tired of my old setup and I wanted
to try something new so I hope you guys
like it it'll probably be tweaked more
and more the more I get used to this the
more I figure things out I'm trying to
figure out lighting I don't know it's
all a new game to me and I'm trying my
best so anyway let's get into this video
we're gonna be doing a full face of
makeup with only 5 products I have done
this on my channel before I will leave
that old video link down below but
recently I've gotten a few products and
the first thing that comes to mind is
wow these could be used in so many ways
so that's what I'm going to be
demonstrating today this is a perfect
tutorial for someone who doesn't want to
have a lot of makeup I don't know who
that is because we all love makeup it
doesn't want to have a ton of products
with them maybe this would be great for
traveling or just an easy look and
someone maybe who wants a more
minimalistic more natural looking makeup
tutorial or look anyway I'm starting off
with a clean face it is moisturize I do
have ice cream on but I don't have any
primer we're skipping the primer guys
because we don't have time for primer if
we only have 5 items that we can use I'm
not wasting one of them on primer so the
first product we are starting off with
is actually a concealer this is from
Eden and this is a duo concealer this is
in a cream formula the reason I chose a
concealer is because I can share this
out on the rest of the face but then
when it comes to blemishes or underneath
the eyes I could kind of build up
coverage a little bit and this one's
also nice because it has two different
colors for me to work with so I will be
starting off with the darker shade and
I'm going to be putting that on my face
I'm not counting tools like brushes or
sponges in this as part of my 5 items
because then it would just be impossible
but I'm going to be taking this on a
brush and I feel like the whole point of
this tutorial is to be fast and easy so
we're not going for full coverage we're
not going for perfect we're going for I
look presentable I look fresh so just
keep that in mind something that's
probably going to freak some people out
is I will
be using a powder today so I will not be
setting this but I find that the less
products you use the less maintenance
you have to do with your skin if you
keep this light and easy I honestly
don't think that not using a powder to
set will be the worst deal ever
obviously you could have six products
and use a powder and if that is
something that's insanely important to
you but you definitely don't need a
million products to get a really nice
look and the reason I'm using a brush
for the face portion of this is just
because I want to be able to control how
thin this product just gonna go on my
face and I find I can do that best with
a brush I don't want a lot of product
like I don't mind if there's more
coverage but I don't want to turn a
product again since we're not gonna be
setting this with a powder I don't want
this to move around and I don't want it
to have the opportunity to move around
if there's a lot of product build-up on
my face so that's what that looks like I
feel like I have a nice amount of
products on the face I've just evened it
out it's not perfected in any way and
now we're gonna go on with the lighter
shade here and I'm going to be putting
this underneath my eyes I'm just dabbing
it on with my finger first and kind of
pulling down I mean be gentle don't pull
too much on your under-eye I bet I find
that cream products work really well
with warmth because they melt into the
skin and again because we're not sending
this with the powder I really don't want
to use too much product and want to work
everything into the skin so there is a
less likely chance of it really moving
around or creasing under the eye I
really like the way that looks I'm gonna
be tapping a little bit of this around
my nose and then I'm going to spot
conceal any blemishes I have and then
just for any areas I feel like need a
little bit more I'm gonna go over with
my sponge one of the things that I
really like about this concealer is it
does dry down to a powder finish so
anywhere I have this it just feels a
nice it doesn't feel sticky or tacky and
that's going to make putting powder over
it easier I'm also going to be taking
some of this over the eyelid as a sort
of primer and just to cancel out any
discoloration so our eyeshadows will
work well over it
taking my finger across my eyelid to
take away any extra product that might
find its way into my crease so I don't
crease throughout the day my next step
is going to be eyebrows now I'm using my
trusty elf brow pencil this is a brand
new one we're also going to be utilizing
this product as a liner today I'm just
gonna fill in my brows like normal and I
will speed this process up so you guys
can see how I do it
but we won't be here for forever
so my brows are done and I am going to
just take my Beauty Blender and just
kind of run over the front portion of my
eyebrows to soften them a bit usually
that just gives them a bit of a softer
look so we're going to return to the
eyebrow pencil later let's move on to
bronzing on my face I feel like a
monitor I look really ghostly and pale
but then again everything kind of looks
a little washed out so sorry about that
I'll hopefully work on lighting and
everything I'm not nearly as white and
pasty then look in this video but I
definitely need to bring some color and
life back to my face and for that I'm
gonna be using a palette this is
something new to my collection I'm so
excited to try this out this is the
Kevin of Kwan neo bronzer in cool pink
Capri this is what it looks like it's so
pretty
and you guys have seen something like
this before on my channel the kiss ombre
radiance palette is something that I've
talked a lot about I've really enjoyed
it I think it's really great so when I
saw this become available on optilead I
wanted to try it out I think I'm gonna
be doing a review video where I'm kind
of comparing the two because this is
absolutely stunning but the price
difference between the two is very very
stark and I'd love to see kind of which
one's better at what the differences are
and kind of give you some thoughts on
that anyway for today's look I will be
using this palette oh I am going to
start off with a bronzer and I'm going
to just dip my brush into the far end of
this palette and I just want something
soft we don't need a ton again we're
going for kind of a more minimal look so
this is just going to bring a little bit
of life back to the face why don't be
putting a little bit on my cheeks and
then I'm going to put a little bit
underneath my jawline another thing to
keep in mind with minimal makeup is that
you are not putting a ton on your face
so what you do put on your fries is
really gonna show up even the slightest
something can really show up when you
only have a couple things going on so
bronzer is on and I'm gonna go on
blush instead of going into the main
pink I'm gonna kind of go into the
bronzy pink area and kind of mix it so
that I get something not too stark but
I'm pretty sure I want a little stark
and of course if you feel like you've
gotten a little heavy you can always go
back in with that beauty blender and
just kind of Pat around the outside
areas but I kind of like the way that
this looks I love the kind of like rosy
cheeks because I'm not gonna have a lot
going on with the face so let's move on
to highlighter again we're going into
the palette and I'm gonna be taking the
opposite side of the bronzer and I'm
going to be highlighting the face this
is a very subtle highlighter which is
something that I do enjoy so you don't
have to worry about going too overboard
and I think it works really nice with
this more like natural look let's move
on to eyes we are of course using this
palette again so we're still on three
items I have a hair on my face I'm gonna
be going in with this color here and I'm
going to just be lightly putting this
all over the lid this is just gonna give
a nice light set to the eyelids next I'm
going to be taking this bronzer and I'm
going to be going into the crease I'm
just using a big fluffy brush for this
and I'm gonna go kind of just lightly
and then I'm gonna build it up on the
outer corners to build up the outer
corner I'm just going in with a bit of a
denser brush and I'm really gonna pack
that on the outer portion and just
because we're only using a couple
products doesn't mean we can't have fun
I'm gonna go in with this pink and I'm
gonna put this in my brows like I
normally do I just came up with this
right now isn't really planning on that
but I thought why not so I'm just going
to blend this gently into the brow in
this upper portion of the eye and you
guessed it for the inner corner we're
going in with the highlighter I'm going
to be placing that right on the inner
tear-duct just to bring some light to
the eye I'm also gonna put a little bit
of this on the inner portion of the lid
just to bring some brightness in if you
definitely use a different brush and
then I'm going to also put this a little
bit underneath the brow bone just to
bring some lift and light to that
portion of the eye we're moving back to
the eye brow pencil and
I'm going to be tightlining with this
I'm also going to run a little bit on
the lower lash line and depending on
what that looks like
I might even run a little bit of this on
the upper portion of the outer part of
the eye so that is us with our liner on
I'm going to go back into the Cavanaugh
Kwan palette we're going back into the
bronzer and I'm going to be putting this
underneath the eye just to add a little
bit more definition this is a very soft
basically like kind of romantic look and
that can change depending on the five
products you use and also something that
can change the five products that you
use is your features I'm very fair if
you can't tell and so I have very little
eyebrows I don't really have eyelashes
unless I define them so for me mascara
and eyebrows are very important whereas
if someone else has dark features they
might not need a mascara or they might
not need an eyebrow pencil as much as I
do so they can get away with powders or
working other products in multiple ways
whereas they won't work that way for me
so keep that in mind as well for your
specific features something that's
really gonna bring this look together is
a mascara I'm gonna be using this new
one from Lancome called monster big and
the reason I'm picking this is because
it stays all day it doesn't flake it's
super black so it's gonna add the
definition I'm lacking in my face right
now it's really gonna bring out my
lashes and I don't have to take a ton of
time to build this up so I feel like
it's kind of in that quick and easy
realm as well really I only need one
coat of this if I go two or even more
sometimes it can get a little too
voluminous for my tastes but for really
quick this is perfect also something you
could do with the mascara is you could
use this as a liner if you wanted to
that is just one coat how amazing I did
get a little bit about Skara on this
part of my outer corners I don't mind
that but we're gonna move on to lips
that's the final thing you can choose
whatever you want if you wanted to pair
this look with like a red lip you would
be bang in and it would really wake this
look up and be a lot more intense I kind
of like how soft this look is I feel
just comfortable I feel put together and
beautiful but not overdone or anything
so I'm just gonna go in with a gloss
this one is from bare minerals and it is
the color sugar you can also just use a
lip balm or just a lip liner
with lipstick whatever suits you again
you could also use your lip product as
part of your blush and multitask things
different ways and this is the final
look guys I really hope you enjoyed this
makeup tutorial I know it's a little bit
more natural it's not as clams a but I
think it's important to remember that
you don't always need a hundred products
you don't always need a ton of makeup to
look beautiful and to look put together
a lot of people work out of a makeup bag
that's really small and they come up
with some really pretty looks and I
think that this is really pretty this is
something I would definitely wear out of
the house it's something that would be
really nice on vacation or somewhere
where you were like getting ready on the
go or you didn't have a lot of time so I
think that is everything thank you so
much for watching guys and I will catch
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
