decided I'm gonna film and get ready
with me today because I haven't talked
to you guys in a long time it feels like
and a lot of stuff is changing again I
swear I can't wait to get to a normal
routine that's for sure as you can see
though I have already done my eyebrows
and my base makeup I did that just
because I do my makeup in the living
room when I do these and I didn't want
to bring all these cream and liquid
products out here and then have my hands
dirty and nowhere to wash them and
everything so we're just gonna do the
color cosmetics on my face today I'm
just gonna talk with you and chat with
you while I do my makeup so hopefully
that's okay so the first thing for my
makeup I'm going to be putting bronzer
on this is so for his bronzer in solet i
was on a silane but it's not this is
sephora speranza insult el rio and i
will be using my Ecotools brush with
that that i got in my box box so one of
the first things I wanted to talk to you
guys about was that I'm going to be
moving really soon so don't be surprised
if you see any background coming me and
Sam just signed a lease for a different
apartment we are only in this permit for
six months because we moved out here and
we didn't know anyone we didn't know
where anything was and we didn't want to
lock ourselves down somewhere too long
because we didn't know where jobs are
going to be and all that so um yeah we
found a new apartment that's going to be
closer to work and it's going to be
closer to my school it's just closer to
everything that we do so we're gonna be
saving gas money it's a little bit
cheaper than this place and then on top
of that we're going to be saving time in
traffic which is amazing i'm already a
super busy person and if i can cut down
an hour and traffic every day that would
be awesome I'm just taking this bronzer
in the places like contour because it is
kind of a more cool toned bronzer and
you know just kind of like warming up my
face giving it some dimension so that's
really exciting and we'll be moving in
there probably in the next two weeks or
so we already have the keys to it and
then this apartments up the middle of
July so we're gonna be transitioning
over there I thought I would let you
guys know that too though if you were
wondering why things are going to be
different in my videos um so hopefully i
can still film a time with us moving but
it might be a little bit more space
between videos just for a couple of
weeks while we get transitioned so i
like to take it down my neck too just to
make sure everything's nice and blended
next I'm going to take this blush by
laura mercier in Bora Bora and I'm just
gonna put that on my cheeks like you
would any blush I kind of build this up
though I put a lot on because it's kind
of a sheer blush another thing to you I
just finished my theater class for
makeup so I'm going to be on to high
fashion so hopefully I'm gonna put a
video up soon with like all my projects
in it that'll be fun I think for you
guys to see just to see what i did my
theater class was all about doing makeup
for theater and the stage so it's very
dramatic looking in the pictures it
doesn't look like realistic because it's
not supposed to be supposed to be seen
from far away or depending on that
theater you know not close up that was
fun i had my final yesterday and Sam was
my model and we did Scrooge so um yeah
I'm really glad to be done with that
cause only because it was just it was a
lot of fun but um I'm ready to move on
I'm ready for the next challenge in
makeup so high fashion is the next class
that's kind of like all about like
photoshoots kind of like america's next
top model so it's kind of a mix between
beauty or salon makeup which we learned
at Theater makeup because it's like a
costume or character and putting it
together so I'm really excited for that
with that being said too I'm off for a
week now that my finals over some off
for a week and I'm so excited because i
have tuesday off well i have a meeting
at work but other than that two hours i
am off for the day so i'm probably gonna
be packing stuff i can't wait to just
have like a day off where no one's in
town i can kind of do what i want even
though I'd to pack but it's like so
exciting and then next Thursday and
Friday me and say we're gonna go down to
San Diego because we decide to take two
days off together because I was off that
week and we're gonna go to the zoo and
just do really fun stuff I'm really
excited for that too cuz it's gonna be
like you know my one break
I'll probably try to do that every time
I finish a class if there's a week break
in between so whoo yeah every two months
I get to take two days off but that's
exciting i'm really excited to do that
i'm probably gonna try to vlog it and I
don't know see if i can get a video out
of it and see just to show you guys also
for my family to show you guys like what
I'm doing and I thought it'd be fun i
haven't really loved much so we'll see
how that goes next I'm gonna highlight
my face I'm using this one by bare
minerals this isn't a love affair I've
really been enjoying this highlighter it
was in my favorites video it's just
really great and I'm just going to
highlight the high points of my face
sorry if I'm looking down i have my near
downey move with a camera i made me read
out here um what else can i update you
guys on i know there was more i'm
excited for work today because we're
having a luau and i've never been to one
of our works events we do um quarterly
for our customers and i'm really excited
i think it's gonna be really fun I get
to wear like normal clothes for the
event that are like luau inspired or
something so that is exciting to not be
in a collared shirt or blazer oh my gosh
I keep hitting the thing so hopefully
that'll be fun I really hope it will be
fun and then then I'll be off I can't
wait for next week though like the next
two weeks for my schedule are amazing
like I'm sure if you guys work or can
relate like some weeks for work they
just stuck and it's not looking forward
to them but these next two weeks on the
schedule i'm so excited to just be a
normal person and have a day off and
good to do stuff i want to it's going to
be so refreshing i'm done with the face
i'm going to start with the eyes i
decided i want to go back to my lorac
pro 2 palette and do that rose gold look
that I've done tutorial on i'll link it
down below if you want to see it yeah
i'm just going to be using rosy and
mocha and beige in the inner corner and
probably buff on my brow bone and nectar
on the crease again I have a whole
tutorial first that nectar color is
going to go in my crease I have already
prime my lids to and I'm just using one
brush today because I'm being like
sometimes that's just how it is that's
just the situation I've just finished up
some of my project pans and I'm excited
because they're over i had so many going
at the same time so now all i have going
is like my year-long project and then i
also have my um oh that's it I think I
just have my year-long project going on
which I am about to add another one to
it um I'm going to be doing I'm gonna be
looking down this whole video it's so
horrible so the only project that I have
going on is my year-long one which I
need to do an update on oh I have
project polish which oh I have been so
bad at that I was doing great my first
like month and then I don't know what
happened I just haven't been painting my
nails like I have had no time no desire
and I've been learning with these
project pans that sometimes you're
really motivated and sometimes you're
just not and I don't want to you know
force myself to do stuff that I just
absolutely can't Matt I'd imagine doing
at the time so I'm just kind of going to
let myself go and once they start using
stuff up I'll update you guys on the
project polish stuff but I just can't be
bothered right now with painting my
nails I know for work we're technically
supposed to like it's in the manual but
you know I'm not gonna get in trouble or
anything so um you know I just don't
have the time to change it out and then
when i get home like I don't want to sit
there and paint my nails if it just that
doesn't sound like fun at all i want to
go to bed I'm like I'm turning into such
an old woman like me and Sam used to
stay up until like midnight all the time
now it's like if we go to bed at like 10
I'm like oh it's late we better go to
bed um like we're just we're working
just really hard right now trying to
trying to get everything done and I
think that's a good thing you know not
all the time but you know right now it's
like what we're wanting to do so I think
it's a good thing it's just a lot so
those are going to be the eyes i'm just
going to add a little bit of an inner
corner highlight and when i say a little
bit i mean bone baby it's pretty
right I don't have like another you
don't have a brush that doesn't have
shimmer on it to highlight my brow bone
so I'm just going to kind of rub off a
little bit of it and just kind of put it
there blend out anything oh so one of
the project pans I'm wanting to start
soon is like a roulette one now I've
mentioned this I feel like in a couple
videos now but it sounds really fun what
you do is you kind of make rules for
yourself and you put them in the basket
and then you pick from that basket so
one of the things could be like a
project you have haven't finished in
another project pan and you have to put
something that meets that requirement
into your project pan or a loose powder
product or a color a colored eyeliner
that you don't normally wear something
like that and so it kind of makes you
have to pick certain things that maybe
you wouldn't have picked originally for
approach Japan so it's really fun I'll
link Heather warns video down below but
I just think it will be so fun and I
really wanted to be fun if a min do
project pan I'm not getting like burnt
out of them but I just want them to
still be fun and I don't want to put too
much pressure on myself like I have to
use it up but right now I'm still not
really wanting to buy anything although
I bought a couple things from work but
really nothing big like I used to spend
so much money on makeup a month and I
really have really hone down on that
which I'm really proud of myself and I
really haven't had the desire to just
like I must get something and so I'm
still kind of wanting to use up my
collection but I don't want to just be
so hardcore and like you know I don't
know crazy about it I don't want to like
make myself feel guilty if I don't
finish something up but i also want to
still kind of give myself fun projects i
just want it to be fun still it's mostly
what I'm trying to say here can you just
say what you mean I didn't set my
eyebrows I'm gonna do that really fast
with my Anasazi of Beverly Hills clear
brow gel I really like this stuff i've
also been into like purple browse lately
inators saw that video
that I posted with the people girls but
I really i've been doing that any day
really i'm not at work and i think i'm
gonna keep doing it I just really think
it's fun I think it looks awesome I'm
going to take this bronze color and put
it on my lower lashline and smudge it
out with my fingers like I always do
I've been really good with my liners
lately I'm really happy to see progress
on like using them up and stuff so I
can't wait to update you guys on my year
project because I feel really good about
about where I am with that and um you
know it's been a long enough that I feel
like I could show you real progress it's
not like oh I just used some of the
shadow and now you can see no progress
this video is so we're happily it's like
oh I thought I had more an update I
thought but I kind of did that already
at the beginning of the deal now i'm
just going to tightline look at this
little guy he's so tiny um this is my
make up forever aqua gel aqua eyes aqua
eyes liner in black oh it looks so much
better with that that one step I swear
just changes the look of my makeup and
then I'm going to use some mascara this
is realest ills long lash mascara this
is just a really pretty look I really
like this look it's effortless but you
still feel really pretty I like this
looks a lot but sometimes when you're
like trying to hurry into your makeup
you'll do barely anything and you'll
look at yourself halfway through the day
and you're like holy crap i should have
tried a little harder um but this one of
those looks at it really isn't that hard
but you know you can still feel proud
and pretty of it with yourself and i'm
just doing one coat well i'm touching up
a little bit on the side and then i'm
gonna do a little bit on the bottom and
then last for lips i'm actually just
keeping it with my baby lips all day
because i'm doing a baby lip seven day
challenge which i will be updating you
guys right after this video on it so
yeah that's everything guys i hope you
enjoyed this video I know it was
rambling if that's how I get ready get
ready with me czar I hope you're having
