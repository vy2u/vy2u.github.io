thought I would do a get ready with me
because I need to get ready to film some
videos and I thought why not just sit
and talk to you guys because I haven't
feels I haven't talked to you guys in so
so so so so long it's been crazy I just
started my job but it's only been like a
week now and it's been really really
crazy so anyway just to start off I did
moisturize I also prime my face and I
use my baby skin primer for that so you
can see look how much progress i'm doing
so well but anyway so my skin is ready
to go and it's primed I also thought
with this video not only would I like
get ready but I would kind of show you
guys what I've been doing for work I
thought since I was working at a store
that sells makeup and skincare and all
these things that like everyone would be
wearing like full-blown faces a makeup
they'd be so glamorous no that is not
the case everyone at my work is almost
like a so many of them are supernatural
or just like normal makeup and it's so
weird for me so sometimes I feel a
little odd wearing like really glam
makeup or like really heavy especially
foundation so I have been going a little
bit lighter with my makeup kind of
letting my you know natural beauty shine
through and so that's the not tutorial
but like get ready i'm gonna do is kind
of like what i've been doing what's my
go-to for work lately and yeah basically
it's just like a really natural look i
guess and a pop of color on the lips
that's what i've been liking to do so
let's just get into it i'm just going to
talk while i do it though it's a to get
ready with me i think i'm in focus now i
hope i was for the intro sorry guys this
is the BB cream i'm going to be using
this is from Rimmel this is a baby cream
Matt in the color light it's one of my
favorite BB creams effort I'm just gonna
apply that with my fingers that's how I
apply it I don't really like to use the
Beauty Blender with anything that's like
to moist liked has too much moisture to
it in the sense of like lotion II
feeling um I just feel like it sucks up
the product seeing what the brushes to
it just makes the brush like unusable
again so
I just use my fingers to smooth at all
over my face and I'm so happy because my
breakouts have kind of been tamed a
little bit I was breaking out so much I
have no idea why well I'm guessing it's
because I was stressed out but um it's
so nice that they're gone and I just
have like some scar and to deal with but
I will take it so as you can tell it's a
very light coverage I again let in
natural beauty shine through we're not
going to worry about too much coverage
but we are gonna go on with a concealer
anyway so any place that you feel like
didn't get enough coverage will go in
with a concealer and conceal that area
the concealer I'm going to be using is
this Maybelline one this is the 51 in
the color fair this is like one of my
favorite concealers ever I'm gonna put
that underneath the eye and I put a
little bit job i knows a little bit here
um I usually have some redness like John
the sides of my cheeks and sometimes all
put some there um and then on my chin
and then these two spots are kind of the
demon area is right now so um and that's
kind of it I know that seems like a lot
but again we barely used any like
coverage foundation wise so this is just
going to help give us that extra bit of
coverage that at least I feel like I
need to feel just a little bit more
flawless although you will still see my
skin into blown that and I am gonna be
using a brush but honestly for this like
it ready with me is why I brought a
brush because I didn't want to bring my
Beauty Blender out here but um I usually
use just the Beauty Blender on this part
and I'll even use it dry sometimes like
I do it I want I don't know anyway I
guess I could talk about my job and
school a little bit right now I'm in the
theater class so I've graduated from the
salon class which was the first one
there's six classes and now i am in
theater and that's going to end in like
we've been in it for two weeks now so in
about three more weeks that class will
end and we'll go to the next one but it
has been really intense in the sense
that we've been just doing full phases
where as before with beauty in the salon
class we would do like learn how to do
eyelashes
and that's what we need to practice all
day and we've learned how to do like I
don't know lips and that's what we
practice all day this is like we learn
how to do an old age or like extreme old
age during that class period then we
practice out ourselves we go to lunch
and then we practice again on ourselves
and it's just it's pretty awesome i'm
really happy with the class it's really
fun um let me know if you guys want to
see like pictures or something because i
have been taking pictures of the
projects we've been doing and they're
pretty i think i think they're pretty
good so let me know if you guys want to
see that the only thing is with school
and that i'm really worried about is the
fact that i go to school tuesdays and
thursdays from 10 to five and i work now
full time like 40 hours a week which is
five days a week so i don't get a day
off like I don't get one day off I don't
know what I was thinking I'm a little
nervous because I think it's gonna be
really tough but we're just gonna see
how that plays out I don't know what was
I thinking concealer is blended in I
look really doing out of that is picking
up on camera it's very duty right now so
we are going to go in and set something
so I'm taking this little elf brush this
is the elf mineral powder brush I like
to use this to set underneath my eyes
and I'm going to be using this
Maybelline fit me powder and I know
you're wondering is there powder in here
Lauren um barely I'm almost done with it
i did repress it and i'll probably use
it up actually getting ready right now I
I know a lot of people don't like to put
a lot of powder under the eyes I kind of
do so i'm going to set the under eye
first and i only use this powder for
underneath the eye this powder is great
because it has like little light
reflecting particles in it and i think
they just work really well underneath
the eye if i put this all over my face
it looks good for like an hour and then
it gets really oily so um yeah that's
what i like to do with it i think it
looks really nice and I'm almost done
with this but i mean i'll probably
repurchase it but i'm just glad to get
through this since it wasn't working as
a face powder for me so for the rest of
the face especially when i'm at work
i've been using my Rimmel stay matte
powder and I did hit pan on this
um i like to use it with this elf brush
that's kind of like a flat top this just
gives me more coverage and it just like
Pat's like I like to Pat it on like this
not like rub and it just helps like set
that um am I saying it helps set the
foundation or BB cream like in like all
the little pieces are like filling in
any gaps there are that's how I think of
it anyway okay going back to me and like
school and everything I'm nervous
because I'm like I'm not gonna have time
to do anything except for do school do
work and then I'm going to try to film
as much as I can so bear with me if
stuff is like weird like if the
Lighting's word in this video I'm sorry
it's just because it's like six o'clock
at night and that's no the Sun looks
like right now / what my lighting
situation is luckily me and Sam did get
to spend this last Saturday together
that was really nice because it was like
my last saturday of freedom since i'll
be working seven days a week now or
going to school seven days a week like
seven days a week means every single day
which means like it's just crazy right
that's crazy um but this weekend was
really fun we went to the korean market
which my hall should be up by now on by
the time I post this video so that was
really fun and we were like in there and
and just like looking at everything and
then that same day Sam was like oh
there's a craft fair that we can go to
an echo park and I was like oh that
sounds kind of fun and we weren't going
to go but then we decided to go and let
me just tell you in Arizona craft fairs
are like where grandma's get together
and they like maybe so do some like
mittens or something and they're trying
to sell them and maybe someone makes
wood stuff and they burn something into
wood and that's what they're selling at
this craft fair on so that's when I was
expecting like something like that open
and um we get there and it is one the
most fashionable people I've ever seen
our walking around so cute so hipster so
I'm so jealous at this point I'm like oh
crap at least I look halfway decent then
we get in it's like his open warehouse
and you have to pay like it was kind of
expensive to get in it was like twelve
dollars or something apiece so we get in
and it's all these little booths set up
but I'm telling you the craft at this
thing they're not crafts they're like
designer things priced at like unfound
designer prices so these are like
potential new designers who are trying
to like get their name out there type of
thing that's what's at this fair not
grandma grandma's not here grandma well
what nice stylish grandmas are here but
everyone else is like it was a crazy
like they were like these necklaces
there was like no there were rocks that
had leather tied around them I'm sure
they were selling it was for like sixty
dollars a piece and there were like
necklaces and stuff which I'm not saying
they weren't pretty and I don't care you
know I think that people should get paid
for their art and they get to pick the
price and if someone's willing to pay it
that's awesome for them because then
they can make a living at what they're
doing I'm not trying to like hate on
people who have expensive art but um it
was just like little necklaces little
dainty little necklaces for like 130
apiece and like the point of the story
any anyway it's just like it was such a
shock to me for the fact that this is
like a craft fair and like me coming
from Arizona what I think of like what
in my head is a craft fair this was like
the most glamorous posh craft fair I've
ever been to ever it was quite intense
and it was so busy and people were
selling like Hannah like homemade
clothes that were really like nice and
chic and clean looking it was it wasn't
an experience that's for sure ok so I'm
all set I'm ready to go with my face so
I'm going to use my hourglass bronzer in
here so that was kind of interesting
that whole crafts fair and that just
also has been happening to me at work as
well I just I'm not used to people
having so much money I just am NOT I'm
not like hating on them for having money
because if you have money you should be
able to spend it how you want and you
know not feel guilty about it it's your
money but where I work is like on the
edge of like West Hollywood in Beverly
Hills and it's just like people have
money and it's just a different
atmosphere and I thought everything here
in California was really similar to
Arizona but I more
inning like no no no no it is not the
same don't be don't be fooled Lauren
don't be blue okay I'm gonna stop
talking a little bit this is my blush in
Neapolitan Lane I'm just going to be
putting that on with my favorite brush
to put on blush this is like an angled
one from Coastal Scents that's where
it's from and I just put a little bit of
that on my cheeks this one's nice
because no matter what lipstick i'm
gonna wear it looks nice okay i know
it's gonna look like I'm so tan over
here and then nothing over here but I
promise you it's even people I'm tan
everywhere i'm using this highlighter
from bareMinerals this is in the love
affair I've really been enjoying this
I'm really glad I kept it from my
declutter video um I really like it too
because it's more of a natural highlight
like it gives a sheen but the color
isn't like more stark white like things
I normally use so I've been enjoying it
and I put this kind of in more places
since it is more subtle so I'll put it
down the center of my forehead down the
nose on the Cupid's bow cheekbones and
then also on the chin a little bit we're
done with the face so the face is all
done and now we're gonna go into
eyebrows for eyebrows I have not been
doing my normal like more I guess
sculpted brow I've been using this
pencil by jordana this is the fab Fab
you bro eyebrow pencil in the color
taupe um i don't know how i feel about
this pencil it's ok it's kind of waxy um
but like a soft wax it almost feels kind
of gracie so it's been okay but before I
use that I'm gonna go in with my spoolie
from the anesthesia anastasia brow wiz
and just fully through my eyebrows I
just like to brush through them I feel
like with all the powder and everything
because I go over my eyebrows with
everything they can kind of get a little
unruly and i'm just going to really
roughly make make my eyebrows come out
more so I really just haven't like no
one there has like really sculpted
browse I just want to make mine like
basically more prominent but I'm not
really is worried about um making them
like you know so I'm like on point and
crazy like I used to like my eyebrows
used to take me forever and one I just
don't have the time and I don't want to
have the time anymore I'm at least like
currently in my life so I don't I've
just cut out the stuff that's what you
do if you don't want to do it and
honestly I don't feel any less confident
so um which is surprising because like I
thought I needed my brows which I do i
need the color i do need the color but
um you know shape wise i can kind of
live without it being like oh yeah you
know i don't know if you know but yeah
i'm going to spoolie back through them
because sometimes the product can build
up weird
and then a little trick I don't have a
q-tip with me so we're just going to
make these eyebrows work but you can you
go in with a q-tip and just kind of
shape what you want if you made like a
mistake or something and that totally
helps to to shape them so um yeah I'm
going to go in with my naked basics and
the middle powder or that powder there
what is it called naked too and I'm
going to now kind of set the brows with
this powder and I like it because it
just makes them a little bit more
prominent yeah so I'm going to do that
really fast when I go get a brush though
so I'm just lightly going in with this
stiff angled brush and just kind of
making the shape a little bit more
defined but again it's nothing like
harsh that harsh i guess i used to do
them very dark and very prominent but
i've noticed too like i switch up how i
do my brows quite often so who knows
like the next time we have like a major
sit down or something i might do them
different anyway oh my camera shuts off
or something happens all the time I like
to switch it up so you might see me with
different browse like every other week
every days I feel different I'm in a
different mood I don't know I tried just
different things all the time so my
biggest goal just like are they kind of
even then yeah that's a success right
and then I go in and I set them with my
brow gel from on estas y'all oh it's bad
like lightning outside all is so scary
now I'm going to go in and I'm going to
prime my lids with my tart can you hear
the Thunder ahhh it's crazy my tart
cream eyeshadow and shimmering golden
beige and this just Prime's the lid just
started raining so I'm sorry if you guys
can hear any of that I obviously can't
help it and I can't even blame the
neighbors this time so my kind of go to
has been to just put something light and
shimmery on the lid so I'm going to use
this color here just something that's
really basic something that I don't know
I just feel confident in no matter what
I'm just going to use
is this elf little brush and put it on
you know as much as I've been stressed
out even with a job now I've been kind
of stressed out because the first week
has been really a lot of work especially
because I'm going in as management
instead of going in is just like a brand
wrap or something that is more part-time
it's been kind of stressful and I
personally I'm just the type of person
that I wish I knew everything even
though I can't there's no way I could
know everything and I put a lot of
pressure on myself to do stuff even if
someone else hasn't anyway even with all
that stress I will say if you want free
product haha get a job in the beauty
industry because I've gotten so much
free stuff just from being there a week
it's crazy um there's just always free
stuff laying all the time you can take
home a sample or something it's crazy
that's what the eyes look like now I
usually will do something in the crease
even if it's not much um i'm going to
use probably actually this bronzer this
has a little bit of a shimmer to it but
it is not too shimmery like the brook
the brown in the palette that's really
shimmery and i don't quite want that but
i usually put something just run it
through the crease just to give it a
little bit of definition but um
sometimes I haven't so you know I don't
know you do what you want but this is
just you know how I get ready really
fast and this can take me I don't know
maybe like 10-15 minutes when I'm not
like rambling and talking a bunch that's
the like top of the list done now I just
go in with liners there's like three
different liners they use this i'm going
to use on the bottom lash line and
smudge it out it's my stila oscar fish
it's still going guys how i'm not sure
but it is i'm not super precise about
this because i just put it on the lower
lash line and then i do this which i
hope isn't total torture for you to
watch
oh I feel like it would be but and that
just gives again some definition to the
lower lash line I'm also going to
tightline really fast with this like
black liner and I'm not gonna do that on
camera Oh actually I maybe can do this
I'll have a different mirror and I got
four from work for free I might cut this
out because it might be horrible to
watch I'm being real with y'all that's
how I that's how I actually do it and
then the third and final liner I use is
this one this is the Elizabeth mod perl
i shadow and i don't know i went from
hating that like kind of liking it to
hating it to now liking it again so i
just put that on the inner corner and
that just helps to brighten the eye
although the lighting really sucks so
I'm sorry guys I also bring it down the
lash line a little bit to keep that
whole area brighter it is like a stormy
night outside eyes are done except for i
guess i should put mascara on right so
I'm gonna use my roller lash by benefit
and just coat them I coat them with one
coat that's it I just don't have time to
build up like 80 coats like no thank you
so just one coat I just basically do
enough to tint the lashes I personally
am like happy with my lashes I think I
have pretty nice lashes so you know I
don't really feel like I don't really
like a clumpy look so I sometimes feel
like with a lot of mascaras if I do two
coats it just gets more comfy than I
personally like so I also put mascara on
my bottom lashes I always do that every
single day and then for the face this is
everything we're just gonna do lips now
I mean that's it it's pretty simple I
don't know how long this video is going
to be so it might not seem simple
because it'll be a long video but again
if I wasn't rambling you know it'd be
faster I'm gonna be using this lipstick
by NARS this is an arse heat wave and
this isn't like the audacious one this
is like their other lipsticks that
they've had for a lot longer and um in
my other video I was wearing an arse
lipstick but I was wearing a different
one from like the holiday set that's in
like a ready orange but personally I
just love these like red orange colors
because they make my eyes
pop they make them look really blue so
and this is a warm color so I did choose
to use like more of a warm color on the
lid like a brighter warm sparkly color
instead if I use like if I wore like a
fuchsia color I would use like more of a
cool-toned sparkly light eyeshadow that
makes sense anyway I'm gonna put this on
my lips and I'm just going to go for it
oh I'm not afraid
and I personally just don't have a lip
liner this color but if you do i would
suggest using a lip liner
ok so that is the final look guys I hope
you enjoyed this video I just wanted to
kind of chat with you I have a lot of
new subscribers and I just feel like I
haven't sat down and filmed especially
because I was filming like so often
posting like five to six times a week it
was crazy that's gonna go down probably
to two or three times a week now but I
love you all I will see you in my next
video I'm probably gonna fend like two
more videos after this one so you'll see
those and I will see you in the next one
