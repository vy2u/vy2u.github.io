Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought I would do a little get
ready with me I really want to do a blue
smokey eye type a situation ever since I
got the My Little Pony palette I've been
really wanting to kind of like utilize
this blue row so that's what we're gonna
do today I mostly want to use this and
then the other thing I want to use is
this Stila glitter I haven't used any of
these if you guys saw my haul in
retrospect and you know that so I kind
of want to do like a maybe cut crease I
don't know I don't really do that very
often with my looks I am more of the
type of artist that like something like
blown out I like more simple things or
like more of an emphasis on color than
on like structure I'm personally not
very good at like really good sharp
lines and also it's just not what I
gravitate to it's not what I love like I
really like something like a watercolor
or something like that then something
that's super like angular and stuff so
that's just what I'm drawn to creatively
but anyway today I thought I would tried
to do something with that so as you guys
can tell I already on my brows done I
did already put up primer on and like
set my base and everything so we're just
gonna get into it I'm pulling for more
than just this palette I have a couple
other things here with me to try to
create this eye look we'll see how it
goes
I don't normally gravitate to Blues
because they do like warmer tones on me
but we're gonna see how it goes
I'm excited I think that really dark
teal is gonna look so pretty in the
outer corner so that's what we're trying
to do today alright to start off I
actually am going to use something from
the My Little Pony palette for the
crease I'm gonna go in with this warm
kind of creamsicle matte shade I'm just
gonna lay that down as a base color just
to bring some warmth to the look we're
just kind of figuring it out as we go so
we'll see how it looks but I think this
might be nice I'm sorry if my bra shows
throughout this video I'm trying to be
very aware of it but if it happens it
happens sorry guys now that I have that
base laid down I'm gonna go in
with this palette this is the pastel
goth palette from Kat Von D I'm going in
with the color dagger which is just a
gray it kind of looks weird on my
monitor but it's just a grey and I'm
gonna be building up that crease and
kind of blending it into the orange
we'll see how those look together some
thing I wanted to bring out for today's
get ready with me is that I am trying to
upload every single day in November I'm
really excited to try to do that I kind
of want to do it till the end of the
year but you know I don't get too crazy
I am going back home though for
Thanksgiving at some point I don't even
know yet with my schedule and everything
but I think it'll be a good challenge to
still upload even with that so I have
been filming more than three videos a
day usually I'm doing like four lately
so I apologize that my looks aren't very
different but that is something that I
do just so that way I can get as much
content up for you guys as possible I
feel like if things aren't centered
around the makeup I'm actually wearing I
don't think it really matters if I'm in
the same like makeup look as I am in
like let's say this one because I am
doing the makeup in it does that make
sense I'm also trying really hard to do
a better job of actually like filming I
try to film every single look that I do
like basically anytime you see my makeup
except for the last time of course I do
try to like film it at least as one of
the videos I'm filming for that day so
if you guys are ever wondering like for
a tutorial or whatever usually if
there's a video where I'm wearing that
same look and it's like a tutorial or
it's a review and there's a demo you can
go see how I created that look in there
I thought it would ask though do you
guys want me to like remove the demos
from those videos like I'll still film
them but I'll just make it a separate
video so that way if you just want that
I can refer to just that video like it
wouldn't diminish any of my content I
would just post both of those videos at
the same time like let's say I was doing
the Leal appellate review and I was
gonna do a demo with that look instead
of doing the demo and adding it at the
end I would
make it its own video uploaded at the
same time as that video and I could do a
little bit more in depth too like I
could leave in the blending and just
kind of speed it up so you guys could
see what I'm really doing let me know if
that sounds like something you would
like or if you think it's fine the way
it is because I feel like I still get so
many comments being like I wanted to
toriel on this I look and it's like like
it's literally at the end of that video
or whatever you know I don't know if
it's just people aren't like watching
till the end because sometimes those
videos can't get long I'm just trying to
find solutions to problems so
interesting no like if I'm wearing the
same look in multiple videos it's like
literally because I'm filming that same
day I'm not gonna like redo my makeup
just to act like it's a different day so
yeah I think I do pretty different I
looks like I know I do a lot of pink and
stuff but if you look back over like the
different actual days I'm filming I feel
like my looks differ quite a bit okay I
really like the way that's looking so
far next I think I'm just gonna start
going in with that darker shade this one
here this is the color princess sparkle
the really deep teal and I'm going to be
putting that on the outer corner I'm
gonna be using just a smaller blending
brush and I'm just gonna be kind of
blending it into the gray at first and
then we can go in and pack more color on
a little later and we're gonna keep that
kind of far down so we have that nice
transition with that gray this color has
a lot of that teal and like blue but
then it also has kind of like a grey
black base so I think it'll look nice
with that gray transition and then I
think I'm gonna go back over with that
orange just to bring a little bit more
but nothing like where you can tell it's
like that's Orange you know and I'm
bringing this a little bit onto the lid
as well I feel like I'm really seeing
some of that blue-green show through
once we get away from that gray so I'm
gonna bring it about halfway in on the
lid so this is where we're at so far I
do want to bring in a little bit more
blue so I'm going in with kat von d
palette in the color of doom which is
the blue and I'm just
kind of like I don't even know just
blend that in as well and kind of use
this in more in the transition
instructor so we can bring out a little
bit more of that blue I apologize if you
guys can hear any like banging around
but the apartment kind of above us has
been put up for rent so there's like
constant open houses going on with
people like looking at the place and
whatnot so there's nothing I can do now
yeah I'm trying to take it a little bit
on this inner corner like not into the
brow but just when we do that cut crease
I want there to be something that it's
kind of like cutting we're definitely
blue for now I want to go in with this
blue from the palette that is the color
Firefly and I'm gonna be putting that
all over my lid and it on the inner
corner as well this is what we're gonna
put that steal a shadow like kind of on
top of kind of I mean we are gonna put
it on top of this it's looking really
cool I mean this is definitely something
a little bit more out of my comfort zone
and I'm excited it's kind of fun
next we're gonna go back into the darker
blue and we're gonna really Pat this on
the outer corner because I feel like we
lost some of this color so we're gonna
blend it into that other color way to
sit down yeah I know I'm not using color
names here it's because honestly I don't
know what I'm like what the name is I
don't really care it's just a dark blue
and if you don't have this palette you
can use whatever you have similar if
you're actually copying this look I
don't think I've ever actually like
copied or like done a tutorial along
with someone ever I'm gonna go in with
this orange and just kind of try to
blend out some of
you just see what that does it might be
hideous it might be cool we'll find out
okay I really like where that's out so
far so I think it's time to go in with
the glitter I don't really know I'm
mostly just keeping this on the inner
portion I might not even bring it all
the way halfway I think I'm gonna go in
just straight with the dopa so um
hopefully I can do this you guys you
guys might see my mirror oh yeah and I'm
just putting this on the front part and
I'm trying my best to kind of like make
it cut out more naturally and I want the
glitter to be the most intense at the
inner corner so I might pack that on a
little bit more alright we're gonna look
down and let that dry because I do have
hooded eyes and we'll be back litters
dry I actually relate the way it looks I
haven't gone in with a brush at all I
just used the dopa to like tap it out
and I think it looks pretty good the way
it is so I do have so much fallout
underneath my eyes like watch this my
finger is like blue so I'm gonna go in
and just kind of clean that up just cuz
I feel like I'm accidentally touching it
and I'm touching my face and then I'm
getting everywhere so I'm gonna kind of
contain it pilot I highly suggest doing
your eyes first if you're gonna use that
blue in the My Little Pony palette I
wasn't gonna do a liner but just
thinking about the way this looks and
everything no no I think it'll just look
better so I'm gonna go in and do a
winged liner I'm probably not gonna
record that because guys it might be
it's already gonna be tough so I'm gonna
do that I have my winged liner on and I
think it's time to just go in and
actually I have a little bit of fallout
still from the glitter after like going
over it with the liner so I'm gonna go
over it one more time then I think it's
time for us to do our face so let's get
that done I'm using a lot of things from
my 12 pans of Christmas project pan
because I want to try to get some good
progress on that so I'm gonna go in with
the cover FX blurring primer
and I'm gonna be mostly putting this in
my t-zone
because that's where I kind of have like
bigger pores and I also get the most
oily I get so oily right here like right
where my biggest pores are that's where
I definitely produce the most oil
something else I wanted to mention and
this get ready with me is I want to say
thank you to everyone who commented on
my last set of videos look like that lip
color
I mean it's so interesting because it
really showed me how subjective makeup
really is because it's if you go on that
video and you look at everyone who left
their opinions on how that lip color
looked for every person that said they
didn't like it they didn't think it was
the best or whatever which I'm not mad
at I'm like I wanted to know what
people's thoughts were because I was
like literally the comments section is
my brain it's like it looks really good
with this no it's great and then someone
I was like this looks not good at all
that was not my brain was so it's really
interesting to see everyone's opinions
on it and it just makes you think like
makeup is just so subjective and like
creative like there are no rules and
what someone thinks is hideous is a
hideous combination and it looks
horrible together someone's like that's
the perfect combination it really brings
out your blue but yeah I just thought
that was super interesting but thank you
I mean so many people left me feedback
on that and I was um I was shocked by
how many people like actually took the
time to comment so I really do
appreciate that primers on and today for
foundation we are going in with the NARS
radiant creamy what is this called every
time radiant cream compact foundation
I'm just going straight in with a brush
into the compact I know I'm so dirty um
no but since it's my personal one that's
what I'm doing so I like to target my
problem areas first when it comes to
stuff like this so I'll really get the
redness in the center of my face and
then from there I kind of blend out and
then I don't necessarily put as much
like I would never put like a ton right
here I would use what I had on my brush
and kind of blend that down my neck so
hopefully I
don't look like I'm wearing a mask
that's always a good goal to not look
like you're doing I do really like this
foundation though it goes on so creamy
and so smooth
I just really have been liking cream
foundations whether they're in a stick
or in a contact form like this
like a good cream foundation is actually
good and then just to give you guys an
idea that's what happened my face looks
like when when it's done so I think it's
a pretty good match to this is a little
bit more cool like you should I feel I
could go a little bit warm but I kind of
I don't know I feel like it's hard to
match my skin tone because I have so
much redness I feel like that kind of
counteracts like I have a lot of redness
in my chest but I'm not pink choke I am
warm toned in my actual skin but because
of all that redness it looks like I
might be more pink toned so it's like I
it's hard I don't want to cover that
entirely but sometimes it can look I can
look really yellow I feel like because
so much redness is coming out does it
make sense
I wonder do you guys struggle with that
and it's really rare for me to go in
with like one color foundation but I
feel like overall this one looks pretty
nice by itself I'm feeling so glam today
glitter always gleams that'll look I
guess in a wing I don't normally do a
wing or really liner in general I do
like the look I feel like my lashes just
always can look so much longer without
that like liner on my lid since my eyes
are hooded I really like the way that's
looking I don't feel like it's too full
coverage like I think on camera it's
gonna look more full coverage the lights
always seem to get rid of any
imperfections or a lot of imperfections
so I do have quite a few breakouts right
now but I think that looks pretty good
I'm actually really happy with this look
so far concealer today I'm going in with
the Estee Lauder Double Wear the more
users the more I do like it we have like
blue on my hand don't want to put that
under my hands I'm not going to use too
much of this I feel like sometimes I can
go a little heavy with it just on me
it's not necessarily
heavy concealer but I feel like I kind
of like layer it up because I feel like
it's not doing much but in reality I
don't think I need that much of it so
I'm just going to be blending that out
it adds a little brightness this is a
bit yellow even though it says it's cool
I don't agree with that I think this is
pretty yellow but anyway I'm just going
to blend that out gently and I'm also
adding a tiny bit to my chin the tiniest
bit to my nose and then also this center
of the forehead just to kind of balance
out the face ooh okay
me and Sam have been watching big little
lies like we're on we've watched three
episodes it is so freaking good I like
love stories like this oh it's like a
more mature like Gossip Girl kind of
like it's just better than that like
better writing that are acting not so
teeny bopper like don't get me wrong I
love Gossip Girl - but if you're looking
for something that maybe won't make you
feel like so guilty watching I highly
suggest the shows on HBO so good Reese
Witherspoon and friggin Nicole Kidman
are absolutely just they're just
gorgeous they're so talented
I mean Nicole Kidman is so freaking
gorgeous I mean and I'm not saying for
her age I'm just saying in generally
she's just a beautiful beautiful woman I
love her so much I'm feeling so fierce I
really like the way that's looking so
let's go in and set I'm gonna be using
my kiss Pro touch setting powder this is
no stranger to my channel I use this all
the time like I said a million plus
times I like to use translucent setting
powders especially under the eyes and in
the t-zone because I don't want to build
up too much product in those areas I
want it to look like natural skin and if
you put like a heavy powder or even
something with a lot of coverage it
tends to just kind of build up there you
know and I am not all about any means
I'm 25 but I definitely can tell that I
am starting to get fine lines you know
like nothing too big I'm not
like say I'm like super wrinkly but I
definitely can tell that I'm changing
you know like my skin is not how it was
when I was 18 and I can get a bit dry
under there or I feel like I just have
more texture than normal or like than I
used to
so yeah it's kind of nice to go in a
little bit lighter I find that those
like heavier powders maybe look good
immediately but for actual wear like for
a regular person not for like photos or
cameras or whatever throughout the day
this and like a lighter look tends to
look better longer and something that's
really really heavy I find once that
starts breaking down
you know things go crazy so I just set
in those areas and then because I'm
trying to use up my revlon powder I'm
gonna set the rest of my face with this
this does have a bit more coverage and I
find that one I'm just trying to use it
up but I do like to keep it more to like
the outer portions of my face it's time
to brown so I'm gonna be using my Laguna
again this is in my 12 pans of Christmas
I'm going to go to the temples I find
that I always like over bronze this
temple I don't know if I just always go
in on too much product at first are from
like sweaty and it sticks like I don't
know idea what's going on but I have
been going back over this area once I
kind of bronze it up with my face powder
to kind of you know tone down any like
right there it's always kind of splotchy
unless I go back over so that's a little
tip if you tend to overdo it on the
bronzer just use your face powder and go
back over it and just try to blend it
out because I do like to bronze my
forehead like I enjoy it and I feel like
we all obviously a must use a lot of
bronzer I use the whole bronze are up in
my last project pan oh so I'm no
stranger to it but I don't want to look
scary I just want to look I like the way
it gives some like life and dimension
back to my skin but I want it to still
look good we're so glam today I did not
bring how to blush I don't know why so
I'm going to be using actually a blush
from this palette since it's right here
I'm going to be mixing these two colors
I really want
something kind of peachy but this one's
a little dark and this one it was a
little more sheer so I'm just mixing
them and now we're just gonna go kind of
light for a highlighter today I'm also
using another project for my 12th Pan's
this is the Urban Decay eye eyeliner
eyeshadow in illusion and we're just
going to dust that on the cheekbones all
the normal areas you would highlight now
that the face is done I'm actually gonna
like kind of set that in place this is a
new product for me it's the Saturday
skin do we daily do a hydrating essence
miss this is just like a kind of like
toner spray step but I kind of want to
see how it works with makeup I have been
using it like skincare wise but I want
to see what it does to the makeup so I'm
just going to spray this on and
hopefully my skin looks a little more
lifelike like it still looks really good
but I want a little dewy okay now onto
the lash line I'm going in with a blue
we haven't used yet this is Illamasqua
Sonia it's a really bright blue I
thought it'd be fun to kind of punch out
the lower lash line with a lighter
brighter blue than what was going on on
top and I kind of want to like blow this
out quite a bit so don't be afraid to
kind of blow it out and I'm only gonna
go half way though because I'm going to
take a shadow from the My Little Pony
palette that's like an iridescent and
I'm gonna bring that half way I think I
look super cool I'm also gonna go in and
just kind of deepen up that outer
portion of the eye using a mix of the
color doom I believe the blue one from
this palette and the darkest shade from
this one so I really like the way that's
looking I'm gonna go in now with the
inner corner so we're gonna be taking
this shade here which is snazzle
it's always such a weird name to say and
I'm going to be putting this on the
inner corner as well as bringing it down
onto that lower lash line and this is
really gonna like seal that icy deal I
ended up not going in with that darker
outer corner shade just so you guys know
on the lower lash line Sam's card I'm
not gonna do any more liners than what I
have on so I'm going in with mascara now
this is the number seven lash impact
ultra I have been liking
and yeah I'm just gonna coat my lashes
generously top and bottom and then we'll
be back for the lip for lips today I'm
going in with something kind of nude
we'll see how it looks I might need to
get a darker lip liner but this is the
color Sydney from buxom and it's just a
yeah kind of I guess a little bit more
peachy nude so I thought it would go
nice with the blush yeah we're gonna
need a lip liner I'm gonna go grab the
darker lip liner just to kind of give
this a finishing touch and I'll be right
back
well I didn't have a darker lip liner
just like on me so I'm gonna go in with
this shade from a color pop and Aquarius
I'm just gonna line the outer part of my
lips as well as as well as the inner
corners of my lips as well as well I
know that looks like you didn't do much
on camera but in person it doesn't help
and then for my liner
I actually am gonna go in with a white
because I just can see a lot of pink so
I'm just going to put white on my
waterline alright guys and that is my
get ready with me I hope you enjoyed
this look this was something definitely
fun a little bit different for me using
the blues I really liked the liner
addition and the glitter like it's just
a fun fun look so I hope you enjoyed
thank you so so much for watching and I
will see you in my next couple of videos
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
