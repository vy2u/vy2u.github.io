Lauren this is going to be a get ready
with me I've been wanting to play around
with this blue liner I bought this from
OC's elite and so I've been trying to
like come up with a look that I wanted
to do if I only came up with one and I
thought why not do it get ready with me
can I talk to you guys I don't know just
hang out for a second I already did my
base makeup obviously but I am gonna be
doing my eyes today so because I'm dirty
dirty brushes and some creativity on our
side and that's what we're gonna work
with today I do have a bit of a game
plan going into this I want to do like a
warm pinky orange eye with that blue to
really contrast and we'll see how that
goes I'm a little bit nervous use this
liquid liner because I don't normally do
like a wing or anything and it's not
like a pen it's like a normal inkwell
type of liner so fingers crossed I don't
totally mess it up but first I'm gonna
go in and I'm going to actually be
filling in my eyebrows with the pink
from the electric palette I'm gonna be
using this color here savage oh look
there I am I'm just gonna be using that
in my eyebrows and imma do kind of like
an ombre look and kind of have it the
most pink on the inside and then it'll
get darker as we go out I like to fill
in my brows before I go in with color
because I have such light eyebrows
anyway it gives the product something to
hold on to I was looking back at older
videos and I thought you know I haven't
done some like ombre colored brows in a
while that sounds fun and so I thought I
would incorporate them into this look
since we're here I wanted to say thank
you so much to everyone I just hit 6000
subscribers which is like crazy so thank
you to everyone who's new thank you to
everyone who's still here that's really
exciting I was at 5,000 for a really
long time so it feels cool to kinda hit
past the 5000 mark I'm also really just
motivated and inspired with my channel
right now which feels really really good
oh my gosh it looks so scary looking
crazy my eyebrows might not be even for
this but anyway I've been really
inspired with my channel lately I just
feel good about the content I'm creating
I feel like I have a good mix of project
panning mentality but still trying out
new products or trying to dupe stuff and
just doing more than just project pants
and I feel like you guys have been
liking it too so that has felt really
great I don't I haven't felt this
inspired with my channel in a while
we're gonna leave that there I'm just
gonna go in and set my brows now with
the clear brow gel from anastacio since
some of you guys are new though I do
makeup that's like my main gig is doing
freelance makeup but it has been really
slow since the beginning of the year so
I've really had a lot of time to put in
a channel and I'm just I'm just excited
with how it's going so far my hair on
the other hand I just I always have it
up and I'm trying to like have it down
and expand and I feel like I just look
like I'm a mullet all the time and I
don't know I'm just not feeling I've
already sent my eyeshadow primer and I'm
gonna go in with the pastel goth I'm
gonna take this white color up here and
I'm gonna just put that all over the lid
into the crease it's just gonna give a
nice base for the orange that I'm gonna
use next and hopefully I don't make it
look even brighter I like a light brow
bone highlight - I'm taking my e-40 it's
super dirty doesn't even look orange
well we're gonna work with it and I'm
going into Clementine and this is gonna
kind of be our transition and just like
all over let's shade I'm really just
kind of putting this everywhere seeing
what we can do I'm not sure how this
look is gonna turn out I really don't
know I'm hoping it'll be good that would
be awesome but maybe not I don't know it
might be a little weird I'm a little
weird so that's okay but I'm hoping
it'll be more cool-kid than just weird
kid we'll see what else can i update you
guys on I guess this is something I
haven't talked about books in a long
time but I am trying to read I just said
Fifty Shades of Grey me and one of the
cast members on the show is working on
we're reading it at the same time we
just kind of happened to be so we kind
of were like book buddies while we were
reading that and so we're like let's see
the movie together this second one I
haven't seen the first one first off but
the second one was so bad I mean the
books already
we are just kind of like think of them
as like cheap candy like they're
satisfying in the moment but like I
don't feel like they're gonna stand the
test of time and they're just that
they're candy there's not that much
nutritional value but honestly I just I
couldn't I could not handle that the
movie was even worse I was expecting it
to be not very good but it was so bad
and honestly it's kind of upsetting
because I feel like the second book has
more action in it like actual stuff
happening besides I love you but we
shouldn't be together but I love you
that whole situation I'm gonna take a
brush that's a little bit more dense I'm
just gonna really pack that on the lid
on the inner portion okay so it's not
quite there I think I'm gonna go in and
ground this look a little bit more
because it's just kind of it just kind
of light so I'm gonna take chickadee I
don't know if this is actually gonna
ground anything but I'm gonna take it on
my e-40 and just buff that into the
crease a little I just wanted to kind of
transition into something else and I
think this will give it a little bit
more I don't know just something more
I mean you easily could do just like a
warm brown really simple eye with a blue
liner and I feel like it's gonna look
pretty classic but of course I'm just
being extra I don't know
trying to do something a little more
crazy I hate how my lighting setup makes
me have like two highlights on my nose
so I'm resisting the urge to like bring
the yellow up and my brow right now I
might take the yellow from the pastel
bath palette we shall see we're gonna
add even more orange and going into the
electric palette and I'm going to be
taking this orange color here called
slow burn and I'm just gonna put that on
the outer third of the eye yeah that's
what I'm talking about and then I don't
even think I'm gonna add any Browns or
anything I was thinking about adding
some of like Oktoberfest which is this
really warm Brown kind of like makeup
geeks Coco bear I mean I don't
shade but if I had to compare it I feel
like it'd be really close to that but I
kind of like where this look is right
now the blue liner was a little scary
for me because I'm not usually someone
who does like cooler tones
I like warms but I thought I could
incorporate both of them since orange
and blue are on the opposite sides of
the color wheel they really have a nice
pop and contrast so I am excited and I'm
just taking whatever's left on my brush
and blending it up I kind of want this
to go a bowl kind of far I want it to
look more blown out I guess than it does
right now I'm going back in with the
e-40 and that chickadee color and I'm
really just going to blend out some
edges oh my gosh I'm getting a little
scared I'm gonna go in with kind of a
big huge fluffy brush I use this to set
my brow bone and I'm just gonna kind of
go over the edges of this without any
extra like product just to kind of get
out of your control a little back to the
e-40 I'm gonna go in here a little this
one just has more color on the inside
there so I'm gonna try to match those up
I don't know I think we're doing okay
maybe I'm gonna go back in with
Clementine and pack that on the lid I
feel like we lost some of that and now
that the blend is out as far as I want
it we're gonna go back in the slow burn
that darker orange shade and just deepen
out a little bit of that crease this is
definitely an interesting look I can
tell you that I'm almost done with the
eyes I'm gonna go in with the yellow
shade here called star and I'm just
going to put this on this inner portion
I really like the look I did with that
faux peanut butter and honey palette
that I do so I'm kind of bringing that
back a little bit feel like it looks so
shiny right now what is up with that
I would do my highlighter on yet we're
getting close to the moment of truth
first though I'm gonna go in and
tightline using my pop Beauty I'm just I
don't want to do stash because it's
green I wanted to keep it with the warm
so this is like a warm bronze color and
I'm just
to thicken up my lashline sorry I'm
talking while looking like a demon and
I'm gonna run a little bit on the bottom
lashline I have to keep reminding myself
that this is a get ready with me and not
just like a tutorial where I'm gonna
edit out all my talking and I'm gonna
smudge that with my finger
I'm taking my white liner like I
normally do and just lining my waterline
which looks like this I feel like it's
especially important just to keep your
eyes light and bright I'm scared okay
we're using this black up eyeliner this
is a cosmetic company that I guess they
sell it to for now but I had heard of it
because they sell it at Nigel's around
here but it is really pigmented really
blue I'm really excited I hope that
it'll look really cool but I'm also very
scared I don't want to mess it all up
right now my hair looks so gross I'm so
sorry so I'm not distracted I'm not
familiar of just for now a little sloppy
bun okay this is pretty rainy so I'm
gonna try to like this is gonna go it's
gonna be in frame sorry guys hopefully
I'm not out of focus ooh look at that
that's a pretty pretty good wing no to
the inner corner
actually I think I'm just gonna go and
do the other wing what I'd like fall out
for my eyebrows I feel like they just
look my skin is all again that good
oh okay this thing is like a million
times better like look how much better
this one is this is like a crazy way all
right guess I'm just going go in Amy on
it we're now going into the inner corner
I don't even think these match it does
find that okay that's all we have going
on too far I'm gonna I need to move on
for my sake at this moment we can go
back I really do like the colors on my
eyes like the way they look together I
just feel like my personal execution of
the liner was a little maybe a little
scary don't mind that you fell out from
my pink brows I'm gonna try to go in
with this mascara and cover my lashes as
best as I can as best as I can as best I
can and I don't know how it's gonna go
though because that liquid liner got on
my lashes on the top side and so they're
like already kind of crunchy and they're
not gonna look very good I'm kind of
disappointed in that I don't think this
is necessarily the liner's fault I feel
like there's some error user error here
if you are really good at liquid liner I
think you could master this and it would
look amazing on you
but since I'm gonna have to put fake
lashes on I'm like what is going on I
don't know
gonna do oh my gosh okay these lashes
look like uh dizzy yes duh they look so
scary okay we're gonna move on just
don't look at it don't look at it like
oh I can't okay I'm gonna go in with the
pastel goth whoa did you want the pastel
goth palette and I'm going to run the
Clementine color under the eyes just a
little and then I'm gonna go in with a
smudger brush and take that slow burn
shade and I'm going to put that on the
lower lash line
on the most outer corner and closest to
the lash line while we're here I'm gonna
go off camera I'm gonna try to salvage
my lashes I'm they're trying to take off
everything off my lashes including the
liquid liner so I can then actually put
real mascara on hopefully it doesn't f
up the rest of my eye look but I feel
like that's the best thing I'm gonna be
able to do so I will be back and you
will see if that's successful or not
okay I'm back I did the best I could
with my lashes definitely still a
situation here but I'm it's done like
you know it's better it's better I like
the idea of this look I definitely think
execution-wise in my part could have
been a little better overall I think the
liner is really pigmented and I think
it's nineties it's just I wish I had
more experience myself using it on my
lips to have NARS or Koo Kien that's
what's been on the whole video and other
than that I think that's the end of this
get ready with me I hope you guys
enjoyed this trainwreck of a get ready
with me I just wanted to sit down to
talk a little bit more chill of a video
than like a more formal tutorial I guess
I need I need some practice guys I need
a little bit of practice I might do
makeup on other people but a wings hard
for everyone that's the lesson we can
take away I think everyone no matter
your skill level can still struggle with
that winged liner that's everything guys
I hope you're having a wonderful day and
I'll see you on my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
