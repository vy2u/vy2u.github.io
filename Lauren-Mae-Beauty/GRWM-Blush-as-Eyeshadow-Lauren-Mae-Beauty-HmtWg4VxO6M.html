that's Lauren thanks so much for
watching today I'm going to be doing a
kind of get ready with me tutorial ish
type of things where I'm just trying out
some new products and then I'm also
going to be using a blush as an eye
shadow what I was decluttering my
blushes I was talking about clinics cult
op and how I wanted to use this as an
eyeshadow and so that's what this video
is going to be I'm excited let's just
get into it and already I'm starting off
with a moisturize face so we're going to
prime it for primer today I'm going to
be using the YSL Touche clot blur primer
now I got this like as a perk but I also
got this from influencer a long time ago
and it's funny because I didn't really
enjoy it then but I feel like since my
tastes have changed I do like it now
it's very smoothing if you have oily
skin this is not going to control your
oils but I really like to have a very
smooth foundation base that's my
preference lately something that's like
hydrating the skin and just letting
Foundation and whatever you're going to
put on top just glide over you're not
catching on anything so that's why I've
been doing this I just don't like that
it has the gold glitter in it that
doesn't make any sense I don't feel like
it translates but you know if I could if
I was making it I would take that out so
next I'm going to go on an audacious and
the biggest thing I want to try to use
is this stippling brush this is from
Eden minerals I put this in a PR haul
which I will have a link down below if
you want to check it out does anyone
else remember when stippling brushes
were how you did foundation like there
weren't these like dense kabuki buffing
brushes it was all about the stipple
brush so I decided to use this see how
it is I also have a foundation from Eden
this is the north skin so I do want to
try it with the brush so you know
they're from the same brand but this is
a little bit too dark for me it's a
little bit pink so I'm going to mix it
with my Make Up For Ever HD and just see
how that works see if I can get a better
color I love this foundation you guys
know and this is very similar it's like
dewy it has like medium coverage it
still looks like skin so I think they're
going to work well I just hope color
wise I can get something that is more
acceptable than just this on my skin and
that's the foundation color we're going
to work with today and see how it goes
I'm just going to put some of this on I
don't want to overload my brush so I
think I'm going to put it
from my hand onto my face and then go in
and I'm just going to kind of do
circular motions and not put a ton of
pressure and I want to try to use this
brush with like cream foundations
because you guys know I love using my
Beauty Blender and I feel like the only
foundations I usually prefer a brush
with are like creams so I put a little
bit more on this side
my biggest thing right now it feels
really soft I think it's going in nicely
I just feel like the brush is quite
large I just want a little bit more
control to get into like you know this
area or around my hairline without
getting into my hair or anything like
that and now that I don't have as much
product on my hand I'm going in and just
using the rest up and going straight to
my hand to the brush so that's my
foundation apply I think it went on
really nicely it didn't like pull up or
streak or anything which is nice I will
say that if I use my sponge
I think I'd get better coverage here on
my cheeks on my nose and also on my chin
those are kind of my more problem areas
for redness but I still like it I think
it looks nice I think that I might like
this better with cream so I'm going to
continue trying that out the brush
itself is nice it's just a little bit
that's probably my biggest thing I just
wish it was a tiny bit smaller but I
also like stippling brush just like that
for like bronzer and maybe even blush
it's a little big though for blush so
that way I can get a nice like light
application that you can slowly build up
to the desired look that noir skin
foundation though it just makes me so
dewy I really like it I'm going to go on
with another ijen minerals and this is
the concealer duo that's what it looks
like I'm just going to go in with my
fingers because this is a cream product
it will work best with the warmth of my
fingers so I'm going into the lightest
shade I really don't feel like I have
like really dark circles or at least
nothing that I feel like you know
ashamed of so I'm just going to go in
and put that in the areas where I need
it most and blend out with my finger I
might bring my Beauty Blender in once
it's on the skin but we'll see I'm also
using it to cover any areas that I have
a lot of pigmentation showing through
okay so I've just applied to under my
eyes and I do really like this is a very
emollient when you put it on your finger
it's not one of those that's going to
like be
really stiff so I feel like it's nice
because it's easily blendable I don't
know what it's going to move around
throughout the day though because it's
so creamy so that's the only thing but I
feel like it does look really nice as
like medium coverage looks good on the
skin especially again for a concealer of
this kind sometimes concealers and puffs
like this can tend to just I don't know
look heavy I think common and I'm just
putting a little bit more on my nose and
it's kind of hard to blend out with my
finger because of my nose being my nose
and it's just like a weird area so
another one with my sponge just Domino's
I guess I'm also bringing it under the
eyes just to kind of make sure
everything is blended so far I like this
I think I'm going to try that darker
shade in here though
next time under the eyes and then just a
lighter one just to see how that looks
but overall like the look so far alright
we're going to set with powder now I'm
going to go in with the Ben Nye neutral
set just under my eyes I barely have any
of this left and I just prefer a really
thin powder under my eyes and to apply
that I'm using the elf blush brush I'm
just working it into the brush on my
hand so that way there's not you don't
see the powder as much and capping off
extra and then going in and in my eyes
and you can already immediately see how
this definitely doesn't look as shiny as
this side but I think it's not a little
bit you know a little bit of radiance to
it I'm also going to use this finer
powder to go into my t-zone areas
anywhere to get oily throughout the day
I just find that the loose powder in
this very thin fine form it helps
control the oils in those areas without
getting caked up throughout the day from
oil production that's always good and
then just to set the rest of the face
very lightly I'm going to be using the
Maybelline fit me powder this is the
translucent one I'm just doing that so I
can put other powder products on top of
my face without them sticking to my
foundation I'm going to be moving on to
eyebrows I'm going to be using my ELF
brow pencil in taupe you guys know it's
my favorite I'm going to speak this part
up yeah and just fill them in lightly so
that's my brows done with the brow
pencil I'm going to go in with the
Lancome source styler source ill styler
so hard to say that name and I'm just
going to brush up the actual individual
hairs
give them
definition you guys know I've been
loving doing this with my brows it just
looks good I'm really into a it was my
favorite so you know I'm into it
so my brows are all done I'm gonna move
on to eyeshadow primer I'm just using my
Maybelline one I've used up my lorac so
this one is kind of the next one to use
up to set my eyeshadow primer I'm
actually going to be going in with this
quad these are two three shadows from a
palette i depotted these are NARS ones
but I'm just going to be using the cream
shade here I've already hit pan and if
you guys watched my eye shadow declutter
I rediscovered this palette in there and
I just decided you know what Lauren use
this and actually use it so I've really
been enjoying it it just is so easy and
a go-to for me so that's kind of Awesome
I'm glad that I kept these shades and am
getting some good use out of them could
they were in my collection and just you
forget about stuff and when you have so
much things just get pushed to the side
and then from this palette I'm also
going to take this really light shade
this is going to just be a transition
for our blush shape we're going to be
using I kind of want it to just be like
a one shadow look on top I don't I just
like picture we'll see if it needs a
little bit of depth in the outer corner
or not and this is just going to help to
blend that color out because it does
have a bit of a sheen to it it's not
like shimmering it just isn't matte so I
think this will just help I've just been
loving this shadow my last video with
the winged liner look I had this in the
crease and I've been using it so much
and now for the star of the show I'm
going to be using the Clinique Kola all
over the eyelid blended into that color
to do that I think I'm going to use this
brush from Ecotools it's kind of just a
fluffy shader brush we'll see how that
applies color my biggest thing is I just
don't want this to look patchy on the
eye fingers crossed
also there's like a guy sleeping so if
you can hear that I
guys there we go look how pretty that is
I already really love it okay so I'm
starting at the base of the eye cuz
that's where I want the most color I'm
just kind of rolling my brush to
hopefully not good as much fall out
I'm also tapping the brush off and I'm
just going to build that color up and
now I'm going to take this just like
fluffy brush with the tiniest bit of
product and just start blending that
color out and hopefully we can get just
like a nice sultry blend I kind of been
okay with this being blown out a little
bit we'll see where the shadow takes us
I'm actually surprised at how well this
is blending out I'm going to take it on
my finger and see how dark that
pigmentation is I'm going to try to
translate that on to the lid I'm
surprised at how pink this is looking
because it looks like a rusty ish red in
the container so not that I'm against
pink but and then I'm just blending it
out once again I kind of want to blend
it into my brows but I don't know if
it's getting too crazy so I will leave
that until the end there isn't it a fall
so I'm going to try to brush that away
with my powder brush and a little bit of
powder and just hope that it goes away
you could definitely do your eyes first
I just don't like doing that it's not my
preferred method on myself okay for the
lower lash line I wanted to do something
like fireball II so I'm going to be
using the Clarins waterproof liner that
I just got and I'm going to be putting
this all on these lower lash line and
I'm going to smudge it out with the
smudger on the other end I just wanted
to keep it nice and warm
I feel like crazy blue and I'm just
nudging it out and I basically brought
it like all the way in to the inner
corner this set up quite a bit of
sparkle in it so I find that it can go a
little sheer when you blend it out so I
just did a second coat of it I'm liking
that so we're going to move on to
eyeliners to tightline way I'm using my
pop beauty you guys know I love this and
I'm just going to put this on the bottom
type line and then sense this look is so
warm and has those red tones I want to
put some white on my waterline just to
brighten my eyes I think I'm liking the
way it looks I have a little bit of solo
over on this side
so I'm going to take the concealer and
my Beauty Blender and just try to cover
up some of that red then I decided that
I wanted the lower lash lines buffed out
just a little bit more so I'm going to
go in with the shade from the Smashbox
ablaze palette I'm going to take this
orange shade because I still want the
orange to be like a big thing and just
kind of buff underneath that liner and
just kind of blend it a little bit more
I don't know I just
it didn't look finished to me yeah I
like that I like the way that looks I
was into the bed table and then last for
shadows on my eyes I'm going to go into
the Eden mineral quad and I'm going to
take this light gold shade here yeah
this one here and I'm going to be
putting that on the inner corner just to
give some brightness and again it's kind
of like this lighter gold shade so I'm
keeping it warm and then to have the
best blend I'm going to try to really
blend it into the lower lash line I'm
also going to finish off my brow bone
and just go in and highlight it with one
of the matte white shades that we used
before just to I don't know kind of
complete the look we're going to leave
the eyes alone for a little bit I'm
going to go in with bronzer and my ELF
powder brush I believe is what this is
I'm using the butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula I'm just going to hit
my like hairline up here just to kind of
warm up the face but also to try to hide
that area a little bit more I'm also
bringing it into the contour type of
area lightly also under the chin and
down the neck I just cracked my browser
I swear the butter bronzer I can't it
can't last if I I just am too harsh on
it and then I'm just going take
whatever's left over on my brush and
just kind of go on the sides of my nose
this is just to not only contour it's
the tiniest bit but just kind of bring
the Brawn into my face as well because
it looks weird to just have like a
perimeter you know for blush I wanted to
still keep it warm so I'm using a ginger
pop from Clinique and I'm just going to
put a little bit of this on
I don't want too much you could also if
you really wanted to do something like
monotone you could do call a pop on the
cheeks of blood and for a highlighter
I'm using the Urban Decay illusion
shadow from The Wizard of Oz go into the
goodwitch palette I've been loving this
as a highlighter again this is something
I rediscovered in my collection from my
declutter and I've just been loving it
it has a really nice Sheen to it without
it having like shimmer and I'm going to
go in with mascara and I will
I forgot to forgot a lip color so I'll
find something that will work with this
and I will show you guys the final look
for the lips I decided to do more of
like a concealer type of nude this is
buxom Sydney and I don't know I just
thought it kind of made sure that the
eyes are the focus if you did if you can
tell that's why I'm trying to do here
with this okay that's everything for
this kind of I guess it's more of a
tutorial I didn't talk too much I hope
you guys enjoyed I think this is a
really pretty look I'm really happy to
where is it I think this is a really
pretty look I'm really happy that I got
to use this I think it's crazy how it
translates though it definitely is way
deeper in the pan then it shows up on
the eye even when I'm like packing it on
with my finger I think it's super pretty
but you can definitely get this look
using like the renaissance palette and
modern renaissance I also think this is
very similar to the Kat Von D will eat a
shadow that's coming out which I'm
actually going to be talking about in a
new beauty launches so stay tuned for
that but I didn't even think about that
until like I was into this tutorial and
I'm like this is basically very similar
to that shade so on our own on if I need
it now
right anyway that's everything guys I
hope you enjoyed the look you can do
this with so many other blushes - I
think that'd be really fun I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
