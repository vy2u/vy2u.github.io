Lauren you guys have been requesting so
many tutorials based off of looks I've
been wearing in like recent videos so
I'm gonna be doing a tutorial today this
is no I would have the looks I always
were hearing me any of the videos it's a
different look it's something I wore
last night when me and Sam went out to a
comedy show and I really enjoyed it as
you can tell my hair is pink now I've
been reunited with my love I want to try
new looks cuz my hair is new so I will
be trying to like go back to those looks
and do them but that's something I'm
really passionate about is just doing
looks I feel passionate about at the
moment so I hope you guys enjoy this
tutorial I think you would I feel like
if I wore you guys or at least some of
you would want to see it anyway so let's
get into it I've already primed my eyes
using my by teary eye primer and then I
also have just set that with some cream
matte shadow it's the one technically
buff from my lorac pro 2 palette first
now that I have like that base down I'm
going to take this brush from Sigma this
is the e-40 brush and I'm gonna be
dipping it into caramel here this is
gonna be like my transition shade I'm
gonna build that up in the crease and I
kind of just buff this not willy-nilly
but kind of a lot in the crease area and
I do a little bit and then kind of build
it up I feel like I haven't done a
tutorial and so so long so forgive me if
it's weird or I don't know I feel like -
I don't have automatic focus I know a
lot of things do I do not know I have to
manually focus everything so if if this
is how to focus at all I'm so sorry I
feel like the last group of videos that
I edited we're kind of out of focus
after the first one cuz I tried to like
zoom in for one of my eyeshadows and I
think I just won I don't I normally have
glasses on so if I don't have glasses on
everything is blurry anyway so yeah I'm
sorry about that
I noticed it just like when I was
uploading one I was like oh gosh but no
one's said anything yet so I glad you
guys are forgiving okay let me check
that out also forgive me
it's to like if I uh make one I'm or
dark or something I feel like it's kind
of hard when you're just using I'm just
using this mirror from the palette and I
usually stand in front of my mirrors and
do my makeup they're positive or my
closet is mirrored so I use that and so
you know when you have to do your makeup
in a different area than you're used to
I feel like that can kind of throw you
off a little bit and if you guys want to
see like a full face tutorial I can do
that too I just knew it would take a
long time if I didn't have my brows done
if I didn't have my face done so I just
made sure to come into it with that done
this is like a super easy tutorial so
it's pretty basic you could use any type
of warm brown color soft Brown I'd be
really pretty
yeah just any really warm brown color in
the crease I just really like that
weight one do you think that's even
enough and pretty London I'm gonna go in
now with my lid shade for that I'm going
to be using this shade right here this
is from Too Faced and it is in the color
bleeding lady it's a really pretty just
like not champagne yeah like a champagne
a pinky really similar to steel is
kitten if you have that this is I
believe a discontinued like shade from a
discontinued palette but anything in
this type of realm would totally work I
just have really been enjoying it Plus
these are in my pan that palette for the
month of April so of course I'm trying
to use them I'm just using my finger
because this shadow just performs the
best that way it looks really good with
a brush but I mean I want like the most
BAM pigment ever so I'm gonna use my
finger and I'm just going to Pat that on
basically the inner two-thirds of the
eyelid and I'm not going too far up into
the crease just because I want to keep
that and that obviously it's my finger
so you know it's not like super precise
but that is what it looks like it's just
such a pretty shade I really really like
it I've used this shade quite a bit and
there's just nothing that quite compares
to an
we'll be sad when it's going and just do
the other eyes now I'm gonna go in with
Anasazi Beverly Hills shadow and Sienna
you can use any type of deeper warm
shade whatever you have this is just
gonna go in my outer corner and just
kind of deepen up the yeah outer pored
portion of my eye but it's still keeping
a ton of that warmth I'm just gonna go
in there you guys will see me as I blend
I do tap this off as well because it's
quite pigmented I just kind of keep it
on the inside portion too because you
don't want to go too far out you've
already kind of blended out those areas
and if you put something harsher like
this out there you're just gonna have to
blend more I'm telling you this is like
a super symbol of the male man or a
woman we have a male woman is here once
again I'm just deepening up you can see
the difference in contrast between this
eye and this eye this eye just has a
little bit more contrast a little more
pop I usually don't like to go too deep
but I know it looks nice I'm about to go
to a pre-production meeting for another
short film I'm working lines so I need
to kind of it's not far away luckily I
feel like our place is quite central to
like anything we would be doing which is
so nice I really like where we live
compared to our old place the whole
place not as cool I really hope these
are even I'm telling you it is so hard
to gauge on the tiny little mirror
it might happen not to be just know that
the intention is to be and that you
should make them even okay now if you
feel like you've lost any of that
intensity you can go back with your
other your lid shade which I am gonna go
do I just want to kind of like blend out
with
clean brush this is just a clean brush
these are kind of like the Mac 217 or
the Sigma e35 I think but um these are
just from Coastal Scents I got these a
long time ago they're not super great
quality they're pretty scratchy but they
work so I'm just kind of making sure
it's nice and blended and then again I'm
just gonna touch up that lid shade
really fast hopefully that looks pretty
good so that's everything for the lid
you can also like highlight the brow
bone but I kind of already did that in
my previous like prepping stuff so I'm
fine with the way it looks
and now I'm gonna go into liners I'm
using kind of a bit of liners for this
look so first I'm going to go in with my
Stila convertible color liner this is in
like a dark navy blue but you could use
black or brown or whatever you want I'm
just gonna tight line with this and yeah
I'll be back I don't know if I'm gonna
show footage of it because it can look
like a man possessed but you can just
see the difference between this eye
that's like watering and this I hear
this just adding that tight line because
I have such like light features just
totally makes me like it looks it just
pops it just gives that contrast look so
much better and I honestly don't wear
any liner other than the tight line on
my top lid this is the worst idea tight
line I suggest using both your fingers
and just pulling your skin back and
getting in there but this is gonna have
to work for now cuz I just cry all over
this little whiner whew after ty
cleaning I'm gonna go in with this Mary
Kay liner this is just in a bronze color
I'm going to put this just on the outer
half of my eyes and then I'm gonna blend
it in with my fingers I'm not into a
really harsh look usually I sometimes do
like a winged liner but most the time
for a day-to-day I just prefer more
blown-out look and I just don't think
you need such harsh lines and stuff I
mean I have a very different style I
mean it's not super different but you
know like I'm not necessarily super
traditional with like using only
neutrals and stuff so I don't know just
try it if you're used to doing more of a
harsh lining maybe
something different and do something
more blown out or blended instead this
is more of like a chit chat get ready
with me then like a tutorial isn't it
oops okay now just blend it out with
your fingers again I just think it looks
more natural now that you have done that
the next step I'm going to now put
shadow on the lower lash line to do that
I'm going to be using this kind of like
smudge brush it's like a short dense
little guy and this is my preferred
brush for putting anything on the lash
line so I'm gonna go into again caramel
from the Miami palette and I'm just
going to be putting that closest to the
lash line and you can kind of connect it
up into this area as well so there's not
like a gap or anything I keep it more
out to the outer side and instead of
going all the way into the inner corner
that's just kind of deepening up that
color
I feel like this side is not very
blended I'm gonna blend that out a
little more I'm just taking another
clean brush and I'm going to line to
this side out more cuz look at them like
crazy I feel like that looks better I
mean I think this one's like a little
bit darker than this side I don't know
I'm gonna check it on a big mirror
before I give you final sniff okay next
I'm going in with a shadow from the Kat
Von D mafia me vida loca palette I'm
gonna go in with the color swoon I
really like this pink shade plus this is
just me kind of like bringing in the
pink from my hair so I'm just taking it
on that same like smudger brush and I'm
going to just kind of put that just
slightly lower than the caramel shade we
put down and just blend it out - it
doesn't need to be SuperDuper start I
just I don't know I think it just adds
something fun I like that it brings in
my hair to the look and it brings up my
blue eyes a lot and I did bring this
when I think into the inner corner just
next I'm going to take a little I don't
even know the little crease brush really
like crappily cut this is again from
coastal signs but I use this from an
inner corner sometimes I'm gonna spray
it down with just this is like a facial
spray but you could use this mac fix+ or
anything you want and I'm gonna go into
a shade from the lorac mega Pro 2 and
I'm going to take that snow color it's
this one here it's a really really
shimmery right almost like basically
white color and I'm gonna put that in
the inner corner and having it sprayed
it's just gonna make it a little more
intense if I had it you know I'm down
for an intense look so I really hope my
beats am home today because if not he's
gonna come home to like all this big
setup I don't think I'm gonna have time
to pick it up before I leave last thing
kind of I'm going to put the glitter
liner from Sephora in the color
sweetheart pink and I'm gonna be putting
that just on the inner portion of my
tear duct on the bottom basically on the
inner portion of my lash line yeah it's
gonna be really pretty it just kind of
gives this a nice pop and I just like
glitter I don't know I like glitter I
feel like I'm whispering in this video
so sorry if the audio is like you're
straining to hear it
and if you like glitter I totally
suggest glitter liners they make
applying glitter on the daily just so
much easier you just don't have to worry
about a bunch of Fallout and getting
everywhere just ruining everything so
that's this I dog looks super pretty I
really like this glitter I really need
to look into if Sephora made these like
permanent or if they were just available
in the set I got a long time ago because
I really like them and the biggest thing
with this you want to make sure the
intensity of the glitter on both eyes is
the same so that way it just looks more
even and ones not like shining at
someone and the other ones like not the
last thing before mascara I'm just gonna
take a white eyeliner and put that in my
waterline just to brighten up the eyes
make them look whiter yeah
now I'm gonna put mascara on this one is
from Milani and this is the lash
trifecta and I've really been enjoying
this it works really well it has kind of
like a curved brush and I don't know it
works well for me so I'm gonna put these
on my bottom and top lashes okay guys
and that's essentially the look I hope
you guys enjoyed it
on my website I'm wearing dolly from
buxom you guys know that's like been my
favorite lip color and it to my project
pants I'm trying to use it up that's
everything I hope you guys again enjoyed
