been such a long time I thought I would
come back into this so they get ready
with me um I haven't filmed in probably
like at least two weeks and usually I
film at least like twice to three times
a week so it's felt like forever I hope
you guys had an amazing Thanksgiving
yeah we're gonna do it get ready with me
today I have a lot of new items so I
thought I would catch up with you guys
use some new items and just kind of have
a chitchat I like to use my get ready
with me so as kind of a bulletin board
for my channel so like if you went into
a local coffee shop there'd be able to
board with all these like Oh updates
here and like random articles and like I
don't know different things that's what
might get ready with me so far so um
yeah let's get started I'm just gonna
prime my face I'm using the blur primer
just in the areas that I need some
blurring so where my pores are biggest I
mean it wouldn't be a video of mine if
there wasn't like 700 million noises
going on in the background but I
definitely think there will be some dog
barking I'm pretty sure the people that
are renting the apartment basically
above us are moving in so that's awesome
but I'm not letting it stop me from
filming a video I'm doing it
we've been back in town for a little bit
now we got back in on Sunday and then
Monday I had two production meetings
Tuesday I had like we were filming half
the day and then we filmed up north
again on Wednesday Thursday I had like a
chance to kind of relax and today's
Friday and I'm filming so we're going in
with another primer this actually was
sent to me from amazing cosmetics it was
like my first package I've gotten where
I didn't know I was gonna get it um they
just kind of sent it out I have received
PR from them before and so that's how I
guess how they have my address but they
didn't let me know that I was gonna get
this so this is the amazing cosmetics
illuminate primer and it's the glow
version you can also use this as just
like a liquid highlighter but I'm gonna
try it as a primer like a glowy
iridescent primer and see how it goes
with the different products I'm testing
out today they're going to be pretty
glowy so I know this will definitely not
be
a matte look I used a product similar to
this earlier and I actually did enjoy it
so hopefully this one is nice
I just thought nikkietutorials actually
use this which i think is funny but it
looked so glowy on her and I don't see
as much shine on me I was a little
nervous after I saw that but yeah I
think that looks actually really nice so
hmm I will continue to try that out it
also has a really nice feel on the skin
so that's surprising for foundation
today I'm actually not using a
foundation I'm using a tinted
moisturizer this is from number 7 and
this is the city light tinted
moisturizer I got this from octal 8 I
thought I would try it out I've been
liking a bit of a lighter look you guys
know that this is the shade of fair and
I find with number 7 beauty all of their
like face powders matte powders all
their face like foundations tend to run
pretty neutral so it's not like quite
pink toned but it's not really like
yellow or warm toned
I think they run pretty neutral so I
don't know how much coverage this is
gonna have I'm just gonna put a little
bit on and then I tend to like to blend
out tinted moisturizers with my fingers
I just find they look the best that way
usually so I guess I'll do that um it's
definitely just very lightweight I
thought that it would have a little bit
more coverage based off of me putting
the swatches on but so far it really
hasn't done much to cover up my redness
which is my biggest thing like even if
it didn't cover it just kind of like
toning it down would be better but I
don't know if it quite did that how's a
nice texture it's a little sticky we'll
see if that drives down a little you
know it emitted you I'm gonna put a
little bit more on my hand and I'm gonna
go in with a sponge and just like my
most I guess you could you know
air-quote problem areas so basically my
cheeks and my chin and just see how a
sponge does I'm sure on camera it's not
looking
like light coverage as it really is I
don't know so far this isn't necessarily
my favorite I'd want just the tiniest
want a little bit more coverage like I'm
okay with light just slightly more would
be good because to me I would just go
bare face then putting this on like to
me there's not that much of a difference
or not enough of a difference I'll test
it out some more and see how I like it
but if you need maybe like you know the
security of like a tinted moisturizer
but don't need it to do much or you have
just like perfect skin you could use
this I guess so because I didn't get the
coverage I want and I still want the
rest of my look to turn out I'm gonna go
in with my Sephora airbrush and I've
actually really really been liking this
you will see in my other videos because
I'm filming quite a few today to you
know catch you guys up on different
things I'm just gonna put a little bit
of this on this is a bit light but this
is pretty um like light in color but
this also has pretty light coverage so I
find it doesn't really I don't think
washing me out too too much or anything
especially once I had bronzer and you
know finish my face up that's just a
little better my skin definitely still
looks like skin which I do like there's
just something so nice about real skin
guys I'm excited because for concealer
today I'm gonna be using the colour-pop
no filter concealer I did make a couple
different orders I didn't find this like
during Black Friday actually I bought a
lot of stuff before Black Friday and
then when I got home after the
Thanksgiving it was all here at my house
so this is the color fair neutral I
dunno what to pick I didn't know if air
is gonna be too light but yeah we're
gonna use this under the eyes I think
color wise it's pretty nice it's
definitely gonna highlight a little bit
and then I'm going to just put a little
bit down the center of my face for a
little bit more coverage and I'm gonna
blend it out with my Beauty Blender
that's what I always do I've heard so
many things yes and nose
Goods and Bad's about this product so I
really hope it works for me because it's
so inexpensive I feel like it definitely
got darker like it dries down darker
than when you first put it on for sure
um I'm not sure I feel I don't like hate
it I don't think it made my undereyes or
anything look like too cakey or anything
or like dry which is something I feel
like I was hearing about it I don't like
that the color dried down because I
wanted a little bit more brightening I'm
gonna put just the tiniest bit again
under the eye cuz I feel like I still
have some darkness there I don't know
how I feel it's definitely not one I'm
like immediately in love with so anyway
a few updates with me like I said I was
shooting north again so I will have a
little like tiny behind-the-scenes vlog
I also I don't know if I mentioned but I
shot a music video like right before we
left for Thanksgiving so I do have some
behind-the-scenes footage so as soon as
that is like out on the internet I'm
going to post like a tiny
behind-the-scenes and just kind of like
a link to that video if you guys want to
check it out I feel like I'm always
talking about my work and I never can
like show you what I'm doing because a
lot of it is just like it just takes a
long time and post and I don't know I
just doesn't ever work out where it's
like a pilot and it might not get picked
up or just different things so I think
it's kind of fun to share with you guys
what I can and I'll let you guys see
what I'm doing so far my skin is just
looking pretty basic I mean this is
pretty light coverage and just like easy
I'm gonna go in and just set with the
translucent powder under the eyes and
also the rest of the face I didn't bring
another face powder out so I guess I'll
just set everything with it it's been
kind of hard since getting back to kind
of like get into life here I mean I was
kind of thrown back into it and we were
gone a whole week which we weren't
expecting we thought we're only gonna be
gone a couple of days but one of the
gigs I had it got cancelled so it worked
out that we could go earlier and it's
like hard because it's still the
holidays and I know we're going back for
Christmas so it's just like you know
it's like a fake little thing being back
out here for like three more weeks and
then going
and we'll probably be back in Arizona
for like two weeks
that's usually what we try to do so I
don't know it's kind of like screwed up
my filming schedule and I really wanted
to daily upload it just didn't work out
and that's something that I'm like
trying to work on I'm gonna do a whole
video actually about like resolutions I
think I did one this year I'm gonna
leave it linked if you want to check it
out but um you know just kind of like
talking about resolutions I have for my
life for the channel for just everything
you know I think those videos are so
just positive and they don't you know
you don't have to start all those things
on like the beginning of the year but
it's always just such a nice marker and
like there's so much like momentum
already going for the beginning of the
year that it's easy to like get it
started and hopefully continue it so if
you guys didn't see me and Sam did go to
Horseshoe Bend I have pictures of it on
my Instagram I have a couple more
pictures I just I haven't been posting
that much I just feel kind of weird but
we went up to Horseshoe Bend which is
really really cool it's it's like up in
Page Arizona which is pretty far up
there it's almost near the border and it
was just like a date trip we wanted to
like give some time for ourselves on
this trip because I find when we go back
home it's like our time is constantly
being like we're going here going there
we're going here we're driving here
we're meeting this person like we want
to see as many people as possible and
they obviously want to see us and it can
just be super you know it's awesome but
it can be exhausting so I wanted a day
where it's like hey this is something
we're gonna do for us like something
that's gonna make this feel more like a
vacation so that was really fun and it
was a pretty far day trip I think it was
like three or four hours but we left
super early in the morning we've stopped
by and Flagstaff on the way and got like
a tea and it's just nice like I love
traveling with Sam but you know I think
there's something about nature then I'm
just so inspired by it makes me feel so
comforted it makes me excited I just
want to travel so much like such a big
goal of mine is to just see the world
like oh we're only here once we got to
see it you know so anyway that was
something that we did we also were able
to make it in town to see one of our
friends do an Ironman which is really
awesome he had been training
a really long time and we didn't think
we're gonna be able to actually go
because there's like this whole party
his brother had planned our friend Liam
people had like a whole party around it
where they like did livestream updates
at the party for it and it was just such
a cool moment and it also made me think
of like the fact that just how important
it is to support the people in your
lives and to take the time out of your
day to go and support people to show up
at a party or to like make things
actually happen I'm kind of going into
my like resolutions right now but it's
just so important you know and you don't
know how important it is and tell you're
there and you're like oh my gosh I'm so
glad I didn't miss this and they're so
happy you didn't miss it either and you
know everyone has the same amount of
hours in the day so for you to spend
those hours with someone else it's just
like it means a lot and it's what life's
about so that was really cool I'm really
really glad that we were able to make it
in town to see him complete such an
amazing task I mean an Ironman is
absolutely insane it's like it took him
I think 14 hours or I don't wanna get it
wrong but it took him a long time like
he started before the Sun was up ended
when the Sun was down and the whole time
he's either swimming or biking or
running like I would die anyway moving
back to makeup today I'm bronzing with
the number seven and bronzer and they
have a couple different shades but this
one is golden sand I have used this one
other time and it's pretty light which
is nice it's a little warm but it is
nice it's pretty powdery as well so you
guys know I love to bronze that forehead
I just I'm losing my hair guys I'm gonna
have a cold isaq seriously it's not a
joke like I mean it's a joke like I hope
you laugh at it but I'm doing it because
it's either that or I'll cry but I think
I have made the decision like if I
seriously go bald
I think I'm just gonna shave it really
short or something cuz you know I don't
want to look like I have like four
actually four hairs on my head
hopefully that doesn't happen for at
least a good like ten years I over all
think that the quality of this powder is
really nice though I think it blends
really nice it looks like soft on the
skin which is cool although I just
always have issues
my forehead guys just don't mind that
that's just me
overcompensating that's what it is I'm
like oh I'm going bald just put bronzer
on it I'm pretty sure this video is
gonna be like the next video I'm putting
up but I still have some videos that I
preach on before Thanksgiving that I
need to get up like my prism let's
stupid I'm in the process of editing it
I also have like a single shadow
declutter coming so you guys like that I
don't know how all that's gonna be
uploaded to you know we'll see but I
will be having a haul video coming up
shortly and I'm so excited to show you
guys all the new things that have come
into my life whether it's from me
purchasing through like gift cards or me
just purchasing online I have some new
products that I'm so excited that I
actually just bought instead of talking
about how I wanted to try them we're
trying to we're actually doing it it's
so funny because again I have bought all
this stuff before Black Friday um I
don't know what I was thinking I guess I
probably could have gotten a bit of a
better deal but it was hard I'm glad I
made that video I'm so glad so many of
you guys liked my like you know how not
to shop during Black Friday or just
things to keep in mind because seriously
it was hard for me this year Black
Friday is no longer a one day thing
Cyber Monday is no longer one day thing
it's just like basically from the day
before Thanksgiving into like Monday
even a little bit on it's just different
sales and just madness especially if
you're on Instagram especially if you're
on YouTube it's like there's so many
different brands doing so many different
deals and like you can just get caught
up in it and you're like oh well 30% off
color problem maybe I should get
something and it was a lot so I hope
that that stopped any of you guys cuz
trust me I was also there with you so
I'm using any product today this is the
BH Cosmetics backlight highlight six
color palette it's a highlighter palette
I've been worn this for a really really
long time I finally picked it up with
the zodiac palette which is what we're
gonna use on the eyes today I kind of
want to use
a mix of the color strobe here which is
like a white and then the a mix of
illusion which is a pink but it has like
a purple blue violet kind of like
duochrome
so I'm gonna just mix them together
because some of these I think will look
a little dark on my skintone oh my gosh
whew that was a lot of pigment oh my
gosh
okay help it's never ending it's knock
it off knock it off the brush oh my gosh
it's seriously what the heck okay
so that was really pigmented I have not
used this yet if you can tell I did
swatch it but oh my gosh guys um I'm not
sure how I feel about that I mean like
it's awesome I guess for a pigment but
like how do you realistically use this
I'm gonna go in and just knock down some
of that shine with my powder brush I
think a lot of this illusion color
really came out because it has that like
purple reflect and I definitely can see
it it's like one of those ones where
it's like if you're looking straight on
you can't see it and then it's like boom
flashes I don't know if you guys can see
that in the monitor okay well that was
interesting
I'm actually doing my brows on camera
today I don't know I might speed it up
still cuz takes a second but I've been
really loving this combo again I feel
like I've gone back and forth and back
and forth on this pencil but I do like
it this is the color pop one it's one of
the newer formulas so this one is
definitely a lot more like hard and waxy
compared to their other one which is
like creamier it definitely has a
different consistency than the elf one
which you guys know is one of my
favorites but you know one of the
complaints I have of this brow pencil is
that it's pretty light but you know it's
like I struggle with my brows quite a
bit I mean they're blonde naturally so I
definitely need something to give me
some definition but I find that ease
my brows can go from zero to a hundred
like in two seconds
and I don't know you get caught up when
you're just like looking at your brows
and doing them but then when you like
look back at a picture or something
you're like holy cow those are kind of
intense so this kind of stops me from
getting too intense because it's just
the color isn't there you know what I
mean like it's enough to start defining
what you can see but it's not gonna like
look crazy and sometimes I look back for
I'll get comments on like really old
videos cuz I have a ton of videos if you
guys didn't know I have like 500 plus
videos on my channel so if you ever need
anything to do need a little bit of a
laugh you can go look at my old stuff um
and see all the weird choices that I've
made in the past some of them are good
some of them are bad um but anyway I
find that this pencil just stops me from
making some bad decisions and going too
overboard which is something I need you
guys know though I'm not super precise I
don't feel like with my brows I don't
carve them out I don't do all that crap
I don't even really pluck them so you
know if you were up close you would
definitely see hairs and then when I use
the elf one for is just the tail so I
start defining that I have been making
that a bit thinner than I normally used
I used to keep it kind of thick um but I
kind of like it it's a little bit of a
thinner tail and then I'll feather it in
even more with the spoolie and I just
find that this like really works alright
and I'm just fooling I do have a new
brow product to show you guys this is
from colour-pop and it's the brow boss
gel now I wanted to pick this up because
I heard J cuz I talked about it plus I
love color pop you guys know and I've
used this a couple times and she likes
it because it gives you supposedly
soaked brow eyebrows and I was like that
sounds pretty cool um I am just I don't
know how I feel about this I definitely
need to use it quite a bit more it's a
very thick consistency but not with like
a hard hold or anything it has like it's
like white it's just a very strange
product I've never used anything quite
like this so I'm definitely try
like figure out how to use it best if I
actually like it or if it's just like
okay or whatever
it doesn't have a ton of hold but I
don't necessarily need that because my
brow hairs aren't like super thick or
anything it's just they're blonde you
know and I kind of like to stick them up
as much as I can I'm gonna leave them
like that sometimes I feel like if I
work with this too much it can kind of
like remove product from my brow and I
feel like we're moving on to the eyes
I'm so excited
um we're gonna ooh hear my voice crack
Wow
we're gonna be using the zodiac palette
now I have used this before and I've
just used it once and I did really enjoy
it the time I used it so I'm excited to
use it again I'm not gonna lie I'm
probably gonna do kind of a similar look
because I really want to use Pink's
today I don't care what you guys say
mm-hmm I just love pinks and I just want
to get back to my roots for a second we
did some blues we did some Purple's
we've done an orange it's time for me to
go back to pink at least once guys let
me have that okay I just I don't know my
hair I got it read I'd by my mom but
I've kind of let it fade out a little
bit so I feel like it's kind of this icy
pink with like a lot of like blonde
pieces showing up so I kind of want to
mimic that on the eyes with like an icy
pink on the lid and maybe go a little
darker with the pinks I don't know I
just know that I'm using this baby today
so this is the zodiac palette from BH
Cosmetics if you've watched any of my
wishlist videos I'll leave them linked I
talked about how I wanted to get this in
my most recent one and I did it guys I
just was like you know what I keep
making orders that color pop why don't I
just make this order and I think I got
this for it was like on sale so I got it
for like 16 dollars or maybe I was Black
Friday sale I'm pretty sure it got it
though for cheaper than the $19 and it
is so beautiful I think this is such a
great palette so far obviously need to
test it more though so like you know I'm
not saying like buy it but so far I with
the swatches and the eye looks that I
have done well that I look I've done I
have really enjoyed it so first off
we're gonna set mine
to do that I'm gonna be using another
new product this is the huda beauty mop
obsessions it has like in matte cream in
it so I'm gonna like just use that to
set down that primer that we put down
earlier earlier like two seconds ago
yeah I have a lot of new stuff I'm not
lying guys so look out if you want to
know what I've got look out for that
haul video I am really excited to just
test out some new stuff and like you
know a lot of it stuff I've picked out
which is always funny because you know I
obviously wanted to try it a lot of it
is things that I've been talking about
like I want to try this I want to try
that and I just bit the bullet and did
it so that is so exciting
anyway if you guys don't know this
palette is set up where the outside ring
of circles is like they are all very
shimmering like metallic shades and then
the middle ring here is matte so I'm
gonna go in with this one here it's like
a pink and I'm gonna be using that as a
transition I'm starting off pretty
lightly and then building that color up
I am gonna be trying to get out reviews
of this stuff I don't know if I'm gonna
be uploading every other day or every
single day I just don't know what my
schedule is going to hold again like I
said we're going back for Christmas and
I'm really trying to set some boundaries
so that I can still upload while we're
gone for so far away whether that means
I do like insane amounts of work while
I'm here to get stuff pre uploaded
because that's the thing I found out is
like once I'm home
I just don't edit even if I have footage
I just truly you know I try but it just
doesn't work out there's not enough time
in the day for everything I need to do
and everyone I need to see on top of
editing on top of sleeping like it just
doesn't work out so I'm gonna try to get
as much work as I can't done before then
and try to work on setting boundaries
and making that more of a priority
because I hate not uploading like I feel
I just don't like that feeling like I
love daily uploading and it makes me
really sad when I can't daily upload I
think this pink is so pretty I feel like
it looks more dusty here but on my eyes
it definitely pulls pretty dang pink I
was also thinking cuz I do have quite a
few new palettes that I would
maybe like all my new palates which ones
are worth it which ones are or like pros
and cons or something like that so you
guys can get some reviews and know if
you should buy these things or not
sooner rather than later because it just
takes so much time I have so many videos
I need to film and I'm excited to film
them but you know even if I did upload
daily it's just with update videos as
well as like things that I've said I'm
gonna do a long time ago like the
Natasha Genoa
Lila palette for looks and palette like
that was a long time ago and I still
haven't done it so it's just you know we
have a lot of things and then the new
ideas that I have and then I'm excited
for it's a lot so okay I like where the
transition is right now I'm gonna go in
with a bit of a smaller fluffy brush
it's still fluffy has something on it
but we're just gonna knock it off and
I'm gonna go in with this one this is a
brown shade and I'm going to just start
kind of working that a little bit lower
in the crease just to get a little bit
more definition I've saw Christie's
video using this and it kind of freaked
me out I was like oh no but I know she
was saying that it wasn't the shadows it
was just like you know you have those
days sometimes they're just like nothing
is working and you just want to like
kill everyone kill yourself just get out
of it
not really obviously that's all a joke
y'all but you know we've all had those
days so I think that was a lot of what
was going on is just like and I think
sometimes too is like artists we're just
too harsh on ourselves and the eye looks
because I thought her eyes looked really
pretty granted that's with lighting and
you know not being there in person and
up close but I thought they looked
really good and I know that I can get
that way to where it's just like I just
don't like something I maybe I'm not
used to seeing those colors on me or
something like that and you just like
get down on yourself and just like I
think it's ugly but um it's okay for
every look not to be perfect and you
know to not like get beat yourself up
about it or anything like that so I'm
just still bringing some of this pink
into the inner corner for the lid I'm
gonna go in with the shade I think
ergo it's like pretty light and really
pretty I think or no I'm gonna go in
folio actually it's like more pink toned
let's do that oh it's so pretty these
are very very beautiful I'm just going
with my finger you could also use a
brush and even use some fix+ to really
get these to shine although I feel like
it's doing a pretty good job with just
the finger and I did try it with fix+
last time and I don't know I don't know
what they're only working so I'm
definitely need to try that out a little
bit more all of this stuff is just kind
of like me playing with my new makeup
and talking to you guys it's not like
full-on reviews and I will come back and
let you guys know I feel like a lot of
people are gonna be surprised by these
baked shadows because I think baked
shadows get such a bad rap because they
think they're flaky and not pigmented
but all the ones around here are very
very pigmented very very they are a
little flaky but they're super pigmented
super metallic and I am they're nice so
just to deepen up that inner corner I'm
gonna go in with this shade right above
Leo and just kind of work that into this
part of the eye and build up the drama
and I'm just patting I'm not necessarily
like sweeping I don't want to really
mess with what we have going on already
especially when it comes to this inner
portion the Matteson here are definitely
powdery so you guys know which I don't
necessarily have a problem with as long
as they blend and because this shadow
palette is so inexpensive I think that
also it's like not a big deal to me al I
just love pinks I think they're so fun
and to me like such a neutral I love
them I'm gonna also bring like
whatever's left on this just kind of
like into that inner corner I'm just
moving to a different brush and I'm just
continuing to stamp that dirt color on
the outer corner and to make sure I have
a good blend I'm going back in with that
fluffy blending brush we used earlier
and blending on the outer edges I really
like through this is looking I'm going
in with the highlighter shade in the
middle for the inner corner and this has
a bit of a gold reflex to it which I
think will be nice to kind of warm it up
you could also go in with something cool
if you like this look is kind of on the
middle like oh gosh here we go I just
love this so much but I do kind of want
to deepen up that outer corner a little
bit more so since this has a black in it
I'm gonna go in with the black I think
well has a purple too but I don't I'm
scared actually I'm gonna go with the
purple and I'm just going to like put
that I just want a little bit more oh I
went into the black on accident I think
it'll just make this stand out a little
bit more and not be just so soft which
is what I tend to do I think that these
blend really nicely though like I'm
really happy with how these have
performed I did not use like this dark
color before or the purple or the black
I just basically used this and a light
brown and then I think I used Verto
before and that was really it was just
like a pretty simple look but so far I'm
really happy with how these are blending
and looking especially for the price I
mean this palette is so reasonable and
so affordable I did go in with a little
bit of that black - okay and now that we
have that down I'm gonna go in and blend
out with the original darker color we
were using which is this one which isn't
that dirt I wish that those ones had
names on them it's like you only get the
outside I just know it's like the leo
with a matt leo it's so pretty this
added definitely some like more depth
and drama though to the look I'm gonna
move on to the lower lash line I'm gonna
be using the lightest pink we used which
is the matte of a Virgo and I'm just
blending out that whole bottom lash line
you're not taking it too far in I'm
really happy too because I really I mean
I don't think I got any fallout with
this palette which is amazing and then
to deepen up the lash line we're going
in with the color the matte I've done
leo and really bring this closest to the
lash line keeping it on the outermost
corner and connecting it with the top
part of the eye I'm so excited to do
looks with this palette because I mean I
just think they did such a great job
because there's some like nice warm
berries but then you have
Loes you have Purple's like you've some
neutrals it's really well done and then
just to keep the intensity to on the
lower lash line I'm going in with the
purple the dark purple and keeping it on
the very outer corner I don't think I'm
going to put white on the waterline
today I don't know I just don't feel
like I need it which is weird usually I
would for a look especially like this
I'm gonna go in with this color from
Urban Decay it's just - I'm just using
it because it's the color I have near me
and I'm in a tight line and then last
for the eyes for mascara I'm going in
with the number 7 lash impact ultra and
just putting quite a bit of this on to
really just deepen up the base of that
eye look I think it's gonna look so
pretty I'm really happy with this look I
like it so pretty for lips today I was
thinking about going with freckle from
nude sticks because I didn't think of
this it turned so purple I don't know I
don't think it's gonna look good though
so we aren't gonna do that um instead I
think I'm just gonna go in with my buxom
Sydney it's a nude I don't like that
either what do I want to do guys really
wanna do and maybe I'll mix them yeah I
hate that okay I'm gonna go pick a lip
color that I like with this and I'll
come back and show you guys okay so I
decided on a lip finally this is elfs
tea rose matte lip pencil it has that
like purple tone honestly this look took
a totally different turn than I thought
it would I thought it was gonna be a lot
more pink and then when I added that
deeper like color to the outer corner it
definitely made it turn more purple I
still love it I think I think it looks
so pretty but definitely a little bit
different than I thought this look was
gonna turn out as that's going on anyway
