it's Lauren thanks so much for watching
this is going to just be a get ready
with me it's been a while since I've
filmed so I thought this would be just
like a fun way to kind of reintroduce
myself do destinies and also try out the
new products that I have waiting to use
and just kind of catch up with you guys
it's how to be just overall a great
video so I do have some new products
that I'm going to be using these are all
from kiss professional I got these from
Offaly for free to try out so I have an
eyeshadow palette here I decided to try
out the pro touch cushion foundation I'm
excited for this I've never tried a
cushion foundation before I'm really
hoping that the color will match me I
chose a primer this is the pro touch
smoothing primer and I have very oily
skin I also have a lot of like pores so
I was hoping this could fill them in I
have a brow product here this is the
color taupe and I'm excited to see how
this works
and then last I did pick out a liquid
lipstick I'm a little scared because
with the lipsticks not my favorite but I
picked a really cool color this is
called wicked forest I think it's like a
really dark either blue or green I
haven't opened any of the stuff now let
me swatch it got it oh it's like frosted
okay so the color is like a dark screen
that's just watching it there so I'm
excited to try this see how it works and
yeah I'm excited for the eye look it's
going to be kind of like warm toned with
a green lip it's like a little muted
Christmas going on the first thing first
let's just prime my face I'm gonna be
using the smoothing primer from kits so
anyway you guys know that I have not
been here if you watched my Sephora vib
sale madness tube top video I talked
about how I got really really sick has a
little seal on it but I got very sick at
the beginning of May like the most I've
ever been in my life and that was
absolutely horrible but I am feeling
better now thank you for all of the get
well tuned comments on that video this
is what it looks like I was expecting it
to kind of be like the Smashbox primer
or even like a flesh toned one so it's
weird that it almost looks like glue and
it kinda has a similar consistency to
like
I got thicker lotion I guess doesn't
really have a smell criminal it's not
that it's just different than I thought
and I have already moisturize my face
and I let it sink in so anyway I had
that happen to me and I was going to use
all the time in the beginning of May to
prep and like it ready for the film she
goes on for six days but that didn't
happen because I got too sick and I was
still working in between that too so
that's why I've been gone so long I'm
sorry but that's just the way it was I
was doing a short film like I said we
filmed for six days but it was over the
course of eight days I worked basically
in between both let's move on this is
the pro touch cushion liquid foundation
I got the number porcelain this is like
the lightest shade the sticker looks
promising though because it doesn't look
pink tone so hopefully it's not super
pink
I know cushion foundations are like kind
of hyped up I feel like don't have as
much now I feel like they're trend has
almost coming on but at least in America
obviously I'm excited to try one out
this is what the compact looks like
pretty standard if you like and have a
little sponge here and then a cover and
this is the product that has a seal over
it so I'm going to remove that oh and
that's it definitely a warmer tone I'm
excited about that I'm going to be going
in with this sponge first because it
comes with it and I see a lot people do
that but if this fails and I like don't
use it I'm going to go in with my Beauty
Blender so we'll see okay I'm trying to
push this in and like nothing is getting
I don't know
let's see silly this might be the
tiniest bit too light for me but we'll
see it's just hard to pick up anything
on this on I'll look but you can see
like if you pull back you see all that
foundation in there it's like cold I
don't know oh wow
I thought this is going to be more
liquidy it's kind of like a cream almost
so it's hard to pick up on the sponge
and already I don't like applying it
with this so I'm going to go in with my
Beauty Blender it's already damp and
dirty hmm and I'll just use this yeah
it's a little light for me but it is a
warm tones of your super light and warm
tones that's kind of nice back to the
shoot day so I had booked a short film
through AFI it's a decent film so AFI is
the American Film Institute and it's a
graduate program for two years for
people to learn either to direct to
produce I think there's art design and
cinematography and editing I think
there's an editing track there's a lot
of different things you can do anyway
a while ago I had met one of the
directors Amy from school because I've
been hooked up for her cycle project
which is like the projects leading up to
thesis and graduation and then the
thesis project is their final film that
they make it's a short film and instead
of it being like a three day shoot it's
a 60 shoot anyway I did one of the
theses last year at the end of the year
and Amy told me then that she wanted me
for her thesis I worked on like two over
cycle social attire and we're just
really good friends like not only are we
like good to work together but we just
go when I'm well a film like this our
short film there's so much different
than working like second wife Club or
anything like that because this is I'm
looking go sleep because the shootings
are so much different so on a day rate
you get paid usually for 12 hours but
just because you get paid for 12 hours
does it mean that's how long you're
shooting for at least four is the
different shows like that on anyway the
shows I've been working on they are not
always a long shoot like they might be
eight hours or like a normal hour day um
but these film ones are 13 hours
actually like working because there's an
hour lunch so you're on set for 13 hours
minimum that's not like if you're
they're a little late packing up or if
you're there early
and that doesn't count direct ends of
your like a super early call time and
you have to leave your house pick an
errand up early to get there with
traffic it's crazy it's a lot of work
it's really cool to do something that's
like story based instead of just like
glamming people up for being in front of
the camera I don't even know where I'm
going I'm just like telling you what
I've been doing so hopefully guys don't
mind anyway so that's what I was doing
for from like the tenth until I got up
last day with yesterday so and that was
really awesome its own fun too because
you're actually working with the same
people over and over and when you spend
that much time with people even though
it's only over six days it's like 13
hours for six days so that's a lot of
time and you just make good bonds with
people so okay we'll go back into the
story in a second so this is the
foundation looks like it's obviously
like I would say like a shade maybe two
lighters for me then it should be nice
but I will say compared to what it was
looking like inside here and like how
thick I felt like it looks I do like the
way it looks on the skin it gives like
medium coverage is what I would say and
I've been enjoying medium coverage
actually lately I'm sending a little bit
more dewy it definitely has a little bit
of a do to it my skin is like showing
through my skin definitely doesn't look
perfect by any means but it looks like
evened out which is what I've been
liking lately I haven't been wanting
super heavy like full coverage looks I
just I don't know I just like looking a
little more fresh so so far this is
actually pretty decent I don't know what
this retails for it's not like my
favorite thing ever
we'll see how it wears I don't know it's
okay it's better than I thought it was
going to be best for short because when
I was doing it with this little sponge
and it's like all sick I was scared that
it was going to look really cakey but it
actually has a nice finish on the skin
next I'm going to go in with concealer
I'm going to use my Maybelline fit me
I'm just trying to use this up it's in
the shade fair I'm just going to put
this under my eyes a little bit on the
nose
tiny bit there and then anywhere I see
just like some rednecks poking through
or anything like that I'm just going to
add it there I don't like to like put
too much concealer on easier cuz though
just defeats the whole purpose of having
light foundation back to the freaking
film we had a bunch of different
locations it's really cool filming for
so long because you get to really make
connections with people and like I feel
like hair and makeup as well as wardrobe
our costume is very close to talent out
of everyone obviously the director is as
well but you know we deal with talent
all the time if talents there I'm there
if talents wrapped unwrapped you know
like I am with them all the time and the
two main characters were there most the
shoot days so it was so cool meeting
them and connecting with them and I
really enjoyed it the subject matter of
the movies very dark so I'm going to
bring it up in this video so looking at
my skin I like the way it looks it looks
really dewy and nice I don't feel like
the primer really smooth too much I can
definitely still see my pores I mean
they're not like massive but it's not
like it's a porcelain primary I mean it
says smoothing on it but it says when
the back reduces the appearance of fine
lines and pores so if this was to me
this is more like a regular primer or
maybe more moisturizing but smoothing
not so much okay so I am going to set my
favor like that I'm going to be using a
mixture of the Maybelline fit me primed
and poreless powder and then this
translucent powder from Ben Nye and I'm
just going to run that under my eyes and
around my city I'm just because I don't
have like a palette I'm just putting a
little bit in here that I'll use right
now you do what you got to do and I've
really been loving this brush from ELF
this is the blush brush mine's like
wonky I think the cut on this is kind of
bad but I just like the size just like
everything about it I tap off the extra
and I'm going to go in under the eyes
first just to set that area and I just
do it really gently I haven't been
liking a lot of powder I am going to do
a face routine with like what I've been
liking lately
because I've just been obsessed was
doing my skin differently than normal I
just I don't really want heavy caked on
skin I wanted I think I'm just finding
beauty in the more simplistic look of
other people and I'm also just not
ashamed of what my skin looks like like
this is my skin I think have a pretty
good skin actually can you see up here
this is like my hair dyed my skin a
little that's cute now I would normally
go to eyebrows so I can let this kind of
sink in and just you know get
comfortable on my skin before it puts
the rest of my powder products on so I'm
going to go on with the eyebrow pencil
from kiss I should have opened all these
things up before so this is what it
looks like when I get the lid the lid
flew somewhere so we'll just keep going
this is what it looks like it's kind of
like an oval shape if you've ever used
the brow pencil from it cosmetics it's
very similar to that in this side it
looks like you could rip this off but
you can't and it has like a little brush
I hate brushes like this I prefer boolie
this reminds me of like a Rimmel pencil
okay so let's just go in I'm not going
to talk during this because this takes
intense concentration so I'm probably
the speed this portion up okay so I
don't want to give my eyebrows too dark
so I'm going to leave them there this is
very for a taupe I feel like this is
very warm toned so I don't really like
the color I like the formula
it's just color wise not my favorite so
yeah I hate the color I feel like it
looks like strawberry blonde or
something Wow I just feel like chokes
are usually more cool toned and this is
not this is sometimes what the color
blonde looks like where it's like a
little bit more warm I won't really
light with it so we're just going to
leave that there
I am going to go in with another brow
product this is from land
and I'm going to do I've really been
liking these types of products this
month in the last couple months but I'm
going to run this through as my setting
gel but also to define the hairs of my
brow and give them more of a realistic
look I like to brush up my brows in the
front portion so it kind of looks spiky
and then just kind of like lay them flat
in the tail portion hopefully this will
give my brows more of that cool toned
look as well you can already tell is is
definitely cooler okay I'm really hoping
I like the eyeshadow palette at this
point everything is a little not my
favorite my favorite things so far would
probably be Z well it's not that I don't
like them it's just if they're not
amazing the browsable I don't like but
um the other two I'm just a little
underwhelmed
so brows are done I'm liking the more
just like chilled out look in general
lately so I am going to go in and prime
my eyelids I'm using the lorac behind
the scenes primer what was i saying
about the film I don't even know it was
just really it was fun it was a lot of
work it felt you know I feel like during
production I'm just like so exhausted I
you know I basically like it's my call
time 7:30 I'll have to like and get up
at 5:00 to get ready to then go and make
sure you don't hit traffic to wherever
our location is and then we won't rap
until at least after early as like 7:30
yeah and then I have to drive home it's
just a lot of time on set and you can't
really do anything else so that's really
why I was gone for so long it feels good
to have the day off and then tomorrow
I'm working which is exciting so that's
good so let's listen to the eyeshadows
right seriously I'm so sorry this video
is all over the place I thought I was
going to like talk more about the film
and all that this is the pink nude
eyeshadow palette and we are just going
to be putting that on the eyes I'm using
the main shade here this actually does
have some shimmer to it there's really
only one match everything else is
shimmery so that kind of sucks I wish
there were a couple more matte shades in
it but personally I don't feel like the
shimmer in here is too insane to just
kind of set my eyeline next I'm going to
be going in with my e-40 brush from
Sigma
I'm probably going to do like a one
shadow look so I'm going to go on with
this medium shade first and just kind of
put that in my crease and I'll probably
end up putting this on the eyelid as
well let me get you guys some swatches
seriously this videos like all over the
place I am so sorry guys it's fairly
pigmented I believe this is a drugstore
price point so I'm pretty you know
impressed with the pigmentation so far
so those are some swatches there I think
that's really nice I just wish I had my
math that's the only thing and honestly
cue for me these colors are just so
similar I wish there was a little bit
more variation because these three are
like these two especially look very
similar and then these three together
it's just they're so similar again like
I said I'm just rubbing this rubbing it
I'm blending this into the crease and we
will see what this turns out to I do
want to use that red though I'm like the
more maroon II shade so I'm not sure
what I'm going to do for this eye look
okay let's just divide front of that
movie and talk about some other things
how have you guys been liking second
Wives Club if you have been watching it
I've been super into it obviously you
guys know I'm like helped be a part of
the makeup school scent show
so obviously I'm totally biased but I
have been really enjoying it I think
it's pretty good so what happens at the
Abby show has also premiered at this
point and that's been a little
interesting to watch as well but if you
have been watching it let me know the
nice things I'm gonna go in with thee I
don't know the red shade I'm just going
to put that all over the lid I guess I
don't know I just wanted to use that
shade I feel like these are nice
everyday kind of colors that you can
easily work with I feel like they blend
it out night again we just need some
medics people I just really hate my
eyebrows wow we've used all of the
products except for one so let's
continue on with the look I'm going to
finish up my face so for bronzer of many
years this wet-and-wild powder this is
in the shade golden light I've really
been liking this as like my just really
light bronzer type of situation and I
say light and then I just
a ton of my face but I just like warms
up my skin I just really like it I
haven't been really contouring much I'm
just kind of bronzing in the hollow of
my cheek and then I go on my jawline
let's go in with a blush I'm just
keeping it very simple today I'm going
in with my train and Tarantino this is
Napolitan Neapolitan lane I knew my eyes
are going to be kind of intense or you
know more warm toned in the lips so I
wanted to keep it more neutral and then
last I'm going to go on with a highlight
I've been enjoying from Laura Geller
this is actually their eye shadow
sensation trio and tiramisu but I've
been taking these two lighter shades
here and swirling them together to get
my highlight and just gives such a nice
subtle glow to the skin so that's what
I've been enjoying and I'll put them
above my eyebrows on my chin and then I
usually go in just with my finger I
really like the tip of the nose
highlighted and then I'll go in on the
Cupid's will now I would go in with
eyeliner but I didn't bring mine out so
let me go grab that
okay I'm back I'm going to be using this
eyeliner from Wright beauty
no pop Beauty and I'm going to be
putting this on my tight line I suggest
putting like a white liner on I'm not
going to today but that will help keep
your eyes looking fresh because you can
tell my waterline looks very red right
now I'm gonna go back into the eye
shadow palette I will say this is a nice
container it's not like in cardboard or
something like nice and sturdy anyway
I'm going to be going in with like an
angled liner brush and I'm going to be
putting some of this color here on the
lower lash line just gently that one's
pretty pigmented so I didn't need a lot
at all and I've decided that I want to
give my eyes just a little bit of
dimension so I'm going to go in with my
color pop brush and the matte shades cap
it off and just place it on the outer
portion on my eye to deepen that area
this is really bringing out the full
moon yeah I kind of like that a little
bit
I'm also going to go in and just
highlight the inner portion of the eye
using the gold shade I feel like this
shade is a little it's just not quite
enough to highlight for me hmm it didn't
nor mine
yeah I thought it was going to be a
little too like yellow now I'm going to
put some mascara on so we can move on to
these with we have the mascara on and
we're moving on to lips guys I'm excited
to try this out this has a very similar
applicator to the uncomment except that
little like chair and like I said before
this is like a hunter green I'm not
going to lip liner because the last time
I did that I felt like it just screwed
everything up so we're just going to go
in straight with the actual product and
I'm going to try to draw a nice lip
shape on me Oh like tickling so I have
my first layer down I'm going to go in
as a second layer I feel like I covered
pretty easily especially compared to how
it was watching I thought it was going
to be way more uneven oh wow awesome
soft calmness I feel like the formula is
similar to the em cosmetics lines like
it's a little bit more powdery it's not
super thick and moosie it's like thinner
but do you feel like this is more
classic liquid lipstick as it's starting
to dry down I think it's a pretty color
I'm not unimpressed so far I kind of
like this I think it worked out nice it
was look to clean my lips I don't know
why okay we are at the end guys this is
what I did the look I did I hope you
guys enjoyed it I thought I would go
through and just like ranks of products
that I tried out and let you know what
I'd like to what I didn't like kind of
like overall verging on realize that so
for my favorite product I think that
would have to be the professional pink
nude eyeshadow palette I think this is
really pigmented for being like
drugstore I wish there were more mass in
it but it is a very trendy palette color
wise I just think these are a little
similar to each other but overall I
think it's a nice just like everyday
palette if you're not someone who needs
like Fanta kind of color but want to try
neutrals that are a little bit warmer
in that like red tongue's family and
this would be nice for the next section
I feel like these are all kind of tied
like I don't hate them but I don't just
love them I guess if I had to pick I
like the foundation the best I think it
looks really nice on the skin it was
just a touch too light for me I feel
like the consistency of it it's kind of
strange for it being in a cushion I feel
like those are usually a little bit more
liquidy and this one's more of like a
cream product and it's not like it's
that cold so I did feel like you know
it's like hard to pick up the product on
to your like sponge or finger and it's
just so it's so sick compared to what
you think it'd be so anyway that to me
was just kind of like but the way it
applied was actually really beautiful
and so I do like that about it just not
a hundred percent one you know what I
mean as for the primer I think the
primer is nice I did something just did
what it said it's going to do it
definitely did not smooth out my face
and my pores it is lightweight it just
is more of a just overall primer for the
skin getting it ready to apply on
foundation so that it's not as dry and
stuff can glide on better but I would
not use this to like still in pores or
to fix any texture issues on someone and
then for the liquid lipstick in this
category I think this is really nice I
think the color is nice I don't think it
was patchy yeah like an interesting
color something a little different it
has a nice formula its transfer proof
that I have like the tiniest bit of this
on there I don't know how it's going to
last for me liquid lipsticks it's like I
don't wear them a ton but I thought I
would just try it out why not by using
this one side giving people would like
it I like that it's not oh really like
sticky I'm sure it will get drying
throughout the day but I just feel like
liquid lipsticks are like that and last
my least favorite product would have to
be the brow pencil it's sad because I do
think the formulas nice and I don't I
kind of like the shape too it's an oval
so you can kind of like do thin strokes
or do wider strips if you do it more
like that but the color on this is just
not cool man at least for me I might
work for other people who need a warmer
toned like whiter taupey color but I
just think that this should have been
more cool toned
and I
prefer to my brows especially with my
pink hair it just like looks kind of
weird on so yeah I don't like the color
of this maybe other colors are better
for other people though okay guys that's
everything I hope you enjoyed this get
ready with me please leave any
suggestions of videos you want to see
down below I'm like trying to get back
into the swing of filming and getting
inspired and have video ideas but right
now I'm just kind of drained from being
sick and just working so much lately so
anything you guys want to see I would
love some you know inspiration and some
suggestions from you guys down below I
hope you're having a great day and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
