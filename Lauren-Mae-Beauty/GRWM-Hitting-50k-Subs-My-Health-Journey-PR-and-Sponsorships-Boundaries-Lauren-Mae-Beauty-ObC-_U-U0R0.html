Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me I know I've done quite a few
tutorials lately and I thought this
would be nice just to do to check you're
ready with me um I think I'm gonna try
two separate tutorials and make them
more just like technique and tip based
and hopefully shorter and then get ready
with me will be a lot more informal kind
of like I've said before an update on my
channel and what I'm doing in my life
and just a little bit more personal and
thoughts on things and whatnot that all
being said yeah let's just get into it
I'm really excited for this look because
my god in my last video I know my look
was like kind of intense I know a lot of
you guys liked it but like editing that
footage was almost hard I'm glad I went
out of my comfort zone and not every
look is gonna be something that you're
just like in love with but like that was
definitely something I was not in love
with so I'm excited to do something a
little bit more of my comfort zone it's
still gonna be colorful I think my next
tutorial or whatever I do is gonna be a
little bit more neutral so anyway let's
just get into this we'll talk products
will be listed down below let's do it
I'm starting off with moisturizing my
face
I have already moisturize my face but
it's been a while this today since I put
that on so I feel kind of dry and this
one's new this is from glam glow and it
is the glow starter nude glow lotion I
got this as the birthday gift my dude
when we were in Vegas the guy was so
sweet he gave me both because we went in
on my actual birthday and so he just
gave me both of the skin care and the
makeup set I was like thank you Dennis
you've been best so that was really
awesome kind of made my birthday isn't
that like that's kind of crazy you know
you love makeup when the little like
sample pack you get both you're like oh
my gosh
I can't believe my life anyway so I was
really excited because I kind of was
torn between which one I wanted to get
because I like the glam glow mask that
came in it and then I've been wanting to
try this moisturizer so it worked out
y'all one thing about this thing it
smells like straight-up
candy it's so so sweet it's crazy so
prepare if you don't like sweets or like
scented stuff you probably will not like
the
should based off scent alone because
it's pretty intense I'm gonna prime
after that lotion just because I'm
mostly just focusing this on the t-zone
and like my biggest pores and texture
areas so I wanted to say thank you guys
so much because it always sounds so
cliche and whatever but like seriously
it's freaking the most unreal crazy
thing to me that I hit 50,000
subscribers like I want to say thank you
so much everyone who has subscribed and
left just amazing comments and just as
supportive of my channel it's amazing
it's just quick it's literally the most
insane thing because you you do YouTube
and like obviously you don't expect that
to happen you like maybe have a weird
daydream about it but it's never like
potentially gonna actually happen and so
for me to hit 50k is such a large number
I mean that's so many people it's really
amazing so I just wanna say thank you
I'm so excited for the channel I'm just
excited talking about the makeup real
fast for foundation I'm just using this
laura geller stick foundation I'm just
using it so it might be a little bit
like on me I just didn't really want to
be extra I do like mix a million stick
foundations and all that so we're just
gonna use the one and then I'm gonna use
a cream bronzer so that'll kind of warm
it up or hopefully you know make it
match a little better so that was like
the biggest thing I first sure wanted to
make sure I mentioned is just how crazy
that is and thank you guys so much for
subscribing and I'm just excited for the
next chapter 100k has always been this
like crazy pipe dream of mine and the
fact that it seems like it might
actually be attainable is insane to me
so um yeah I just want to say thank you
I'm so excited for the community we've
created I'm glad you guys like just get
me cuz I know that sometimes I'll watch
my videos and I'm like girl like you
need this smile okay or like can you
just have an influx in your voice or
just like you know you're always your
harshest critic but yeah I just
it's amazing that so many of you guys
just like get me it's so nice you know
to just have a community like good so
thank you thank you
thank you moving on from that something
that we did today that was like crazy
exciting me and Sam if you don't know
cuz a lot of you guys are now my
husband's name is Sam so if I say Sam
like I'm talking about my husband so we
are going on a family trip to Italy this
next summer like this summer coming up
it's crazy cuz it's like gonna be
happening very very soon but we bought
the tickets today it's like you know
we've gone out of the country quite a
few times like we try to make it a thing
for us we'd love to travel but buying
the tickets is always like one of the
hardest things to do because it's like
quite a bit of money and it's like you
know Airlines and like you just want to
make sure you have the right ticket the
right times all of that and also
airlines are always going up and down
and like I don't even know how that
racket all works so it was kind of like
scary to buy the tickets but we actually
bought them today we got them for like I
think we do have to pay for our bags
separately which is something a little
bit different but I think it's still
gonna end up being only like 800 or so
dollars apiece for our tickets for a
round-trip with our bags that's a steal
of a deal if you know if you can get
something out of the country for less
than a thousand I feel like that's
pretty good so I am like so stoked we
were able to find those tickets and that
we were able to just pull the trigger on
them and get them it's very exciting so
I'm really excited for Italy I'm gonna
be there from like the end of will we
fly in basically like June first and
then we're not coming home until like
the 20 it's almost so it's kind of a
long vacation
it'll be really fun we're gonna be there
the first part with Sam's family and my
mom and then we're gonna be there the
like a last bit for a whole week just us
two and I cannot wait so I'm already
thinking about so many things of like
what I want to do like what kind of
makeup I want to do what kind of
clothing oh my gosh I didn't even blend
all that my nose but what kind of like
clothes I want to have for the trip so I
I'm just really really excited for it
and I cannot wait so that's something
that was just like crazy crazy exciting
that was happening for us today and that
kind of brings me to my next point so
the reality of the fact that we're going
to Italy is
setting in it was like always this thing
but now it's like oh shoot we got
tickets like it's real so something that
I've been wanting to do and it's part of
like my resolutions and just part of
like my life resolutions it's not like
the beginning of the year but just like
girl you got to get healthy and I want
to lose weight so I'm using Italy as
kind of this endpoint that hopefully
will it kickstart it and like make it
happen so I am going to be eating like
keto if you guys don't know about that I
will try to leave links I've talked
about it in a past video but again I
feel like my audience has grown so much
that half of you guys will be like what
are you talking about but I have done
keto just for like a little bit in the
past and I've decided that I'm gonna go
back to that and what it is is it's a
high fat moderate protein low carb slash
sugar diet that's what I want to do um
I'm not really asking for a bunch of
advice on this I'm just kind of like
telling you guys just so you know I
appreciate it
let me live my life though um and yeah
so I'm excited to just do that I want to
do it for 30 days and then kind of like
regroup see where I'm at hopefully in
the 30 days only some weight and I'll be
excited and like you know the gears will
be going oh yeah I'm like really
actually pumped for it I always hate
talking about this type of stuff
sometimes because you know you say
you're gonna do stuff and then you go
and then it's like you know I've said
this in my resolutions but you know now
50,000 people learn to be like girl what
are you doing
but I do kind of want to be held
accountable a little bit so yeah I
really want this to be an actual change
in my life and my lifestyle and just I
want to be healthy like that's the
biggest thing like I'm confident I love
myself but I do want to be healthy I
want to be able to do more things feel
more comfortable in my body live longer
so yeah I'm really excited about that
so my foundation was not too light for
my skin tone but it was kind of like
coverage so I'm gonna go in with my
concealer and I might put this kind of a
lot of places just to make sure I don't
know my skin is like sufficiently
covered seriously my skin always looks
like ten
million times better than a dozen person
I feel like not that much my skin is
pretty nice but I'm just saying like I
think they'll like no matter what on
camera it just always looks so much
better
and doesn't look as red or anything like
that but in real life it's you know I
needs a little more coverage for me for
the look I'm doing too because it's
gonna be colored and I'd like to have a
bit of a fuller coverage when I'm using
colored eyeshadow products so anyway I
just wanted to like kind of talk to you
guys about that kind of like health
journey or whatever I'm starting I'm
mostly focused about the actual eating
portion of it like the food not
necessarily as much exercise not that
I'm not going to be exercising I
definitely want to try but I know myself
and I know where my problems are and
it's definitely more the types of foods
that I'm eating and the quantities of
food that I'm eating so I think that
that will be a good place to start I
want to lose the weight healthily and I
want you again make this like a
lifestyle change not just like Oh lose
10 pounds real fast you know so I'm
really I'm really pumped for it and you
know I'm like trying to picture myself
in Italy just being cute ass bitch and
like some phony dresses and you know
just feeling like just totally feeling a
hundred percent confident and that's
like motivating me so much right now I'm
excited to to like look up keto recipes
because I'm a pretty picky eater and so
um it's gonna be kind of interesting and
fun to like stretch my tastebuds a
little bit and hopefully I can do that
or I'm gonna be like eating the same
food and I don't want it to be boring
and I also don't want to like constrict
myself in the sense of like if
something's happening or whatever I want
to like you know be able to enjoy myself
but yeah not right now I mean not in
this 30-day period for sure I'm really
focusing to like get the ball going so I
can like see the progress and see the
weight loss so that way I get even more
hyped you know I have two new products
to use for powders today I'm super
excited so the first one is from Becca I
got the sent to me from octiline and
Becca has never been in my store I don't
think so I
tried anything from them from oculi
before so I was so excited when I saw
this on the website this is the soft
light blurring powder in pink haze now
I'm gonna just be using this under my
eyes today it's pink I did take off this
sticker but I haven't used it yet
hopefully this looks nice I will be
testing it out more I like to use my get
ready with me as kind of as my first
impressions because I'm not like trying
to claim it's a review or anything and
then I can come back and let you guys
know you guys can see the products and
all of that so this is the first time
I'm using it it's pretty pink even on
the brush you can see the pink I feel
like I can definitely see that it's a
little bit pink kind of always I mean
let me pull my mirror in closer it's a
nice powder I think like texture wise it
looks fine it's just a little actually
pink and I'm realizing right iron here
all the sirens I'll get back to you guys
I want to think about that next though
oh my gosh I'm so happy I picked up the
Maybelline fit me powder in fair I've
heard so many good things I'm basically
out of my loose setting powder from kiss
so I was like I need to pick a new one
up and although this is a translucent
which is something I like I just I've
been wanting to try this for a long time
and it was actually like an appropriate
time for me to buy it which was crazy so
I picked it up that kind of brings me to
the next thing
I I will have my no bi video and like
update already up by the time you see
this but um I thought I would talk about
it here I think I did pretty well on my
no bi I broke it because I did buy these
things I used me hitting 50k to like be
like I'm celebrating but I do find much
result drugstore was like three products
at the drugstore but still it was it was
like it wasn't hard but it wasn't easy
you know so I would definitely oh gosh
what did I just do why am i insane okay
so I got powder literally everywhere
it's all over my shirt so I'm gonna use
this to set the rest of my face I just
don't think that I have as big of a
problem as I used to I think one it's
like III really do try like a more of a
looker and a lurker and just like to be
excited about the
than I am actually like buying all the
products which is different than what I
used to do which is good I'm happy about
that because I don't want to buy
everything one of the things I realized
is it's like if I want to buy like three
things from the drugstore and I haven't
really bought anything like I don't
think that's necessarily bad and all the
things I picked up are things that I've
either heard about I've been wanting for
a while and I just kind of bit the
bullet on so I don't know I don't know
how I feel about the no buy situation I
think more than anything I just want to
try to keep being on like a low buy but
I'm sure you guys will hear about all my
thoughts in that other video and you
probably have already seen it I don't
know how I feel about that powder so
we'll see again I'll keep testing that
out you guys will see that in like
reviews or whatever I'm thinking about
doing a series kind of like my Holland
retrospect but for products that maybe I
didn't haul necessarily but that I did
you know use in a get ready with me or
something like that and I don't have
another video to really spotlight it
because honestly I'm not someone who
really loves just like individual
reviews it's just like I don't care
enough about one product to like review
it for like ten minutes it's just it's
that's boring to me so I was thinking
about maybe you know doing like a
check-up on my first impressions or just
like checking up on products in my
collection I don't know let me know what
you guys think about that I'm using my
Laura Keller bronze do you guys know I'm
trying to hit pan on this for the year I
like a huge sit here it's so near to
ting oh my gosh you guys I haven't I had
a zit literally not by my lip literally
on my lip the other day it was kind of
it wasn't like a super big zit it went
away really fast but it was like I mean
like in the middle of my lip how does
that even happen can someone explain
that to me cuz I was like sitting there
baffled as to how the body even let's
that happen I'm like please god no
oh why would that ever
into someone so anyway the next thing I
kind of wanted to talk about in this get
ready with me is PR because I have been
reached out by a couple more like
legitimate brands if you're creator than
you know once you have like about a
thousand subscribers or so you start
getting reached out to buy like just
weird companies or just like smaller
brands or Amazon sellers and just
different things like that and they want
you to like review your their product
and put it in the video and do all this
stuff and it's something I had to learn
along the way is what my boundaries are
when it comes to sponsorships and PR and
and the like so I was thinking about
doing the tube talk on this but I don't
know I feel like the last couple to
talks I've done have been very like
creator centric like if you're not a
creator like you probably don't really
care but anyway so I've definitely come
to like full understanding of what my
boundaries are and what I'm willing to
do and all this stuff because I don't
want this to get too like I'm not
complaining about it I'm just trying to
like have transparency I try to have
like a balance of that because I don't
really enjoy watching people complain
about things or get too personal like I
want to just tell you guys and have
transparency without it being too
personal and like look like I'm ever
bragging or complaining or anything like
that so anyway I want to have
transparency with you guys so one of the
things that I've learned and definitely
have decided is that like I actually get
bigger I feel like you actually get PR
where someone will send you out a
package but there's no strings attached
to it like you literally could get the
package and throw it in the trash and
you know they wouldn't know they
wouldn't whatever but when you're
smaller and I feel like some brands try
to get you to like will send you this
product for you to make a custom video
for us essentially or do a product
review on it and if you want to spend
your time as your Creator doing that
that's all on you or whatever but like I
just don't like one shoving like the
whole point of that is to get their
product out there and for them to have
exposure and I don't
have to review their product especially
if I don't like it and to me getting a
cleanser or whatever it is is like it's
not that big of a deal dude like it's
not that I'm not appreciative of it it's
just I don't want to spurt out a bunch
of like individual review videos for you
guys for them because they sent me
something like if you want to send me
something cool you can send it to me
here's my address but I'm not like going
to necessarily make a video about it I
don't have to talk about it I will fit
it into a video if I want to if I
actually enjoy it or if I don't or it
fits into my content naturally I'm super
happy that I'd like come to an agreement
with myself and I've come up with like
how I read my emails to people which
honestly most the time I don't even
respond back to the emails because it's
just too many and I've decided that I
really only want to take PR from brands
that I'm I was genuinely excited to try
beforehand or that I've heard of or that
I think will somehow benefit you guys so
basically if I decide that I do like
want to try these products out for
whatever reason I'll email back and I'll
say hi thanks so much for reaching out I
would love to try these products out
just to be upfront if I decide to show
these products on my channel I only do
100 percent honest reviews good or bad
and yeah that's basically it and then
I'm like let me know if that works for
you essentially and then a brand goal
either get back to me and say yes or
never get back to me or whatever and
that's just the way it is like I don't
care I love getting product don't get me
wrong but I'm not gonna like I won't do
anything to get product don't really
care okay new product this is the
Maybelline total temptation brow definer
this was basically Maybelline was buy
one get one 50% off like they normally
do and I've been wanting to try this out
so I thought if I bought the powder I
would get this pencil and dry it but
yeah that's kind of what I've decided is
like gonna be my little message I soon
to brands back if they do happen to
reach out I will say I recently had an
email message with a brand and they kind
of sent out a generic message and I
wrote back because it was a brand I had
heard of and wanted to like I would like
to try a product from they wanted
creators to kind of fit it into a
specific type of
like it was kind of like a getting ready
with me or a nighttime routine or
something like that words like you're
featuring these products essentially but
it wasn't sponsored at all they would
just send you some products for that
video and to try out so I did want to
try these products but I was like I'm
not making that video so I emailed them
back and was like I would love to try
out these products but just do you know
like I only do a hundred percent honest
reviews I can't promise when I'd have a
video up or what it'd be in I only like
to do content that I feel like would
suit my subscribers or after I've tested
a product for a long time and so I can't
promise if slash 1 this would be
featured but if you want to send it over
for me to consider that'd be awesome I'd
love to try them out and they actually
got back to me were like thanks so much
for being honest we'd love to send you
them and I was like that's so awesome
and something that that showed me that's
not like a bragging story this is
getting it to a lesson I've learned is
that you make the rules right like I
think it could have been so easy to
respond back to that Brandon and feel
like pressured like the only way you can
get these products as if I do a certain
thing but it wasn't like all I had to
say was like I don't want to do that I
only do content that I feel like is
natural that I come up with naturally
and I think my subscribers would like or
after I've tested a product a long time
like I'm not basically gonna do that
type of video and I can't promise you
when / if it will be up but if you want
me to try it out like you can definitely
do that and I wrote my own rules and
they appreciated it hopefully and I mean
they're sending me out the product so I
just thought that was like a cool moment
of like realizing my power and not like
I'm a dictator but just like realizing
the power that you have to set a
boundary and say hey and that you can
give the other you can propose something
new and outside the box or maybe
different than what they said it's not
rude or mean or anything like that and
then they have the right to respond
however they want to whether that's not
responding or how they did which was
respond back which was really cool or
not give it to me but respond back like
whatever it was they the balls in their
court now and I don't know I just was
just definitely a moment of like
learning and I feel like YouTube if you
get to the point
where you are getting brands reaching
out or just things like that like it's
undiscovered territory you don't I don't
know how to handle it I don't know
what's happening you know so it was just
like a cool moment anyway
I thought I would just talk about PR
though and just kind of let you guys
know that if I'm ever showing PR
obviously it's a hundred percent honest
my opinion with octoly I do talk about
it in videos like that's one of the
things like you do have to review it it
doesn't have to be an individual video
or anything but you do have to talk
about it but what I love about them is
that they let you be honest and I just
think that brands really awesome but
when it comes to other PR I'm gonna make
it like where it's just basically if you
want to send it to me awesome if you
don't cool like you know I don't want to
have anything tied to getting that
product even if it's like they still
want your honest opinion but it's like
they want you to feature it in a video I
don't want to do that you know so I just
did my brows pretty fast I thought it
looks I think it looks pretty good I was
being very light handed though so we'll
see with more time how that works out
I'm going to be spooling through some
clear brow gel I know everyone has like
their feelings on PR and I get it I
don't think that the idea of PR is bad I
think that how individuals handle PR can
maybe not be the best and so for me it's
about working on and creating a system
that will hopefully never let me be tied
to a brand too much you know what I mean
I'm just gonna set my eyelids really
fast another thing too is like with my
when I get PR and stuff I personally
just don't feel comfortable at this
point in my life not saying it'll ever
change but I thought since I have new
subscribers and I feel like this is more
relevant to my channel than ever before
is I don't like affiliate codes that are
specifically to a brand I will get ones
so that way you guys can get a discount
but I don't feel comfortable making a
commission in that way I do use magic
links but for me it's different because
it's so many different brands on there I
don't have an affiliation
to a specific brand for you to buy off
of their website or to use my code it's
just like hey I spent the time to find
this if you use the link and happen to
buy through it I really appreciate it
and I make between one to ten percent
usually it's like on the lower half of
that and not all of my magic links are
actually retail like monetizable they're
just short links essentially instead of
the long ol link so anyway that's why I
think they're different whereas for me
this is just my personal thing I mean
it's no hate everyone can run their
channel how they want and that's their
prerogative and their story and I love
that but for me I don't want to ever
accidentally or it just can it can
snowball so fast and you don't even
realize it so I don't want there to be
some kind of benefit for me to push this
brush over this brush or I don't know
anything like that I mean not even just
brushes obviously product and sometimes
you know you can get a kickback of like
10% 20% ten dollars a sale all of that
and it's like I like to do YouTube and I
like to tell you guys about cool
products and I'm not here to like sell
like if I wanted to work in retail I
would be back at justice I just don't
want to sell quite like that like that's
not how I want to make my money
personally I'm not against doing
sponsored videos but I just I haven't
done one yet and I probably won't for a
while because I want it to be something
that I really believe in and I want to
think outside of the box with the
sponsorships that I do end up taking
eventually if I ever decide to do it but
for me the difference is I'm taking the
money from the brand and creating
content that you guys can decide to
watch or not watch um whereas with
affiliate links like I'm pushing and
selling to you guys to spend your money
and because you spent your money I get
money which is different you know anyway
let's move on to the eyes I know I'm
getting like this could be a whole tube
talk I know but if you decided to watch
a long ass get ready with me these are
the treats you get okay I'm gonna zoom
in cuz a lot of guys have been liking
that and I think it just helps you guys
see what I'm actually doing on my face I
believe we're in focused and ready to go
today I'm using the Kevin of Quon
palette and I have done quite a few
things with this recently this is
something that I would have never bought
but I got this from octoly but it's
before
something that I really was like oh
whatever but like in person it's so
pretty and this color is just been
calling to me I did recently do a look
with it not on camera I did it on my own
and I've been wanting to just basically
put this color all over my eye all over
it like it just blend it up I also
wanted this to kind of be a thing where
it's like showing that you don't always
need like matte transition colors
obviously those make the most sense for
every single day I realize you can't
even see my mouth so this isn't
voiceover it's me right now real life
but you don't always need transition
colors you don't always need a mid-tone
Brown compared to your skin tone or
whatever and they don't always need you
Matt you can do whatever they want guys
obviously knowing about matte shadows
and what they do and shimmer shadows and
what they do you can play with that and
that knowledge and create ilex that you
want but there's no real rules
you're not going to explode if you put a
shimmer shade in your crease
you won't you want explosion so anyway
to put the color on the lid I'm going to
be using a fluffy brush still but
something a little bit more dense and
just going to be placing that and
buffing it again all over the lid I've
really been into just like one shadow
looks lately - I just think they're so
pretty and easy and sometimes I think it
can get so complicated and what I'm
drawn to especially like on Instagram
and just different looks
it's just something simple and just
beautiful and I guess a little bit more
editorial my last look was intense I
like something a little bit more
ethereal than that but you know maybe
I'll work on that skill and start to
like it the more I do it it could just
be that I'm not used to seeing my face
like that - and then just to make sure
the lid is pretty covered I'm going to
take my fingers and just press this
shadow all on the lid and I'm using my
finger to kind of blend it up as well
I'm always like flipping you guys off
when I use my finger and now although
that is beautiful we're going to be
going
with a second color from this palette
and it's gonna be this light pink one
this is such a pretty like duochrome
color again just stunning
I know I probably have a lot of fallout
well clean it up in a second but I'm
gonna be taking again another fluffy
well I got blue on it where are you
taking a fluffy brush and going into the
pink and I'm going to be basically
buffing this over the entire shadow and
it just kind of lightens it up it's a
little bit more of like an ethereal glow
to it since we're working with shimmer
I'm just kind of like using that to our
advantage and not being afraid to really
blow out the look and make it look kind
of dainty I'm just pretty just pretty
guys and that's the difference see how
this it just has like a little bit more
of like a glow to it then this is this
one still beautiful but I just really
like this one better I feel like this
step also adds a bit more dimension to
the look since it has that kind of like
duochrome aspect to it and I really I
really like that I'm loving that a lot
but I'm also gonna take my finger and
stamp this onto the lid see that color
oh there we go look at that such a
stunning color you could easily do this
look - with like makeup geeks backlight
which i think they're discontinued or
did discontinued Urban Decay's tonic
looksies duper star or any of those
shadows that are like purple with a pink
and blue kind of reflex I kind of just
like made my own of that with these two
colors I can't that's just me I love it
so much since we already have the face
done I'm just gonna go in and do the
bottom lash line which is literally what
we did on the top but on the bottom so
I'm putting the first darker color and
I'm just gonna smoke that out on the
lower lash line I am gonna keep it a bit
on the outer half instead of taking it
too far in just cuz that's my preference
and I felt like I just feel like I can
take away from the look of it's too dark
under my lash line and then we're going
into the pink for the inner corner I
didn't do a highlight on my face which
this will probably be the highlight
mixed with another one but I'm going to
make my inner corner
my highlights so I'm gonna be putting
this Becca Bellini chases champagne
dream I don't know whatever this one is
I'm going to be putting this on the
inner corner and I'm gonna be dragging
it into the purple so pretty and then
what I'm gonna do
which is what I did the last time I'm
gonna put this on the center of the lid
as well just to kind of highlight it so
I'm taking a flat shader brush and I'm
just gonna like lightly tap on the
center of the lid I'm not making it like
a big deal just kind of adding a little
bit more light to the center and giving
just the softest kind of halo eye effect
I had another goopy but I got it out of
my eye guys sorry sorry sorry and then
the other highlighter we're using is a
new one this one is from when Wilde and
this is blossom glow I've been wanting
to try the Wet n Wild highlighters since
they first came out but I believe this
is like a newer one of what they do I
think but I'm gonna just put this only
on the inner corner just to add again
some more of that light and bright to
the eye I'm gonna zoom out so we can
finish the face and I'm also going to
get a lip product for us so we can
actually have a lip product to put on
we're almost done with the get ready
with me I know I know
a long one so I'm taking the highlighter
that we used first from Becca and I'm
going to be putting that where I would
highlight and I go pretty heavy with
this one because it doesn't really add a
brightness to my cheeks like we're some
highlighters can look like lighter than
your skin this one definitely doesn't do
that for me it adds that pink and a
shine but not necessarily the brightness
now I'm the scary part this I think is
gonna be pretty intense so I'm gonna go
in kind of lightly at first and just see
how it does oh yeah
see that's pretty intense for lips today
I decided to go with this gloss from
Becca I got this in the set with the
highlighter I just used it was on sale
for like seventeen dollars on Sephora
right after Christmas and I think it's
just
and to that like a theory look I
realized that I don't have like liner
and lashes on so we'll do that don't
worry guys I feel like I have the ring
inside my lips because of my foundation
what the heck y'all I'll fix that in a
second I'm gonna do my mascara with the
Urban Decay perversion I'm gonna be
putting Mac's coast to reach on the
tight line and then I'm going to be
putting this white liner on my waterline
all right so I applied the mascara and
the liners and everything I scrubbed my
lips and we put the gloss on so they are
fine now I also got rid of any of the
fallout underneath my eyes and I'm going
to be spraying my face with the Milani
make it last setting spray I've really
been enjoying a setting spray lately and
I just I like the way it makes my
highlighters look sometimes I feel like
they can look a little I don't know like
powdery on the skin but when I use the
settings right definitely helps so if
you have a problem with highlighters
like I would try that I know that's not
like a big secret tip but I've
definitely been enjoying it lately
I like sprayed my eye straight I think I
got a bad sprayer on this seriously cuz
there's no way if that's how the sprayer
was and all the ones people have raved
about that it would be raved about so I
haven't given up on it but I'm kind of
just like why did I get a bad one and
that's the final look guys I really hope
you enjoyed this tutorial I've been
having a ton of fun using this palette
and it's something that I didn't think I
would like as much as I do so I hope you
guys enjoyed thank you so so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
