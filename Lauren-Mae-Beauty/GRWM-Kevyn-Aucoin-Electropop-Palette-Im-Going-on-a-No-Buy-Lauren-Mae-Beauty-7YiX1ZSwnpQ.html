Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me and I am super excited because
I'm using a new palette this is
something I actually got sent in the
mail to me from octoly when this popped
up on the site this is something I
definitely wouldn't purchased myself but
when it was available for me to review I
was like yeah I want to try it out I was
really excited with this palette because
it's so fun and colorful I feel like a
lot of times brands come out with those
neutral palettes and this just seems
like so so much fun so I'm excited to
play around I've decided that I'm going
to be doing a look using like these two
colors the black and this cream here I
think it's just kind of like fun and I'm
gonna put this probably on the bottom
lash line I figured you guys would
expect me to use the pinks and also I
mean the neutrals are just kind of
boring so yeah that's what we're gonna
do today
I already have my brows done and for
anyone who's curious I used the color
pop brow pencil in the front part of my
brows my ELF brow pencil in the ends and
then I use the elf clear brow gel to
just brush them up and I've been using
this combo for the last like week and a
half I love it I mean this is my normal
combo but adding this it's been great
we're gonna start off with the eyes
because I don't want to get any fallout
from any of the colors I'm gonna be
using so we're gonna start on that
they're already primed I just turned
down the color so hopefully it's not as
like bright let me know if you like it
which way better that is gonna be a
great way to know which lighting is
better anyway I'm going to be going in
first with just some neutrals because
that palette does not offer anything
really too matte or anything for the
crease which I kind of don't mind only
because of the fact that we already have
a million of those things so I'm just
going to be putting a cream matte shade
this one is from Coastal Scents it's in
ShamWow and I'm putting it like not on
the inner portion of my eye just kind of
in the crease area and transition where
we'll be buffing out some colors so we
can lay down a base for the teals we're
gonna be using I have so many fun and
exciting things to talk about today I am
so excited if you're new which you
possibly could be because my channel has
been growing a lot lately welcome
welcome back to obviously all of the
people who have found me before but my
channels been growing quite a bit lately
which is always so so exciting I'm going
to be going in with the shade pumpkin
pie from Coastal Scents this is going to
be the first transition I'm going to lay
down it's just gonna be the lightest one
it's gonna add some warmth even if I'm
using cool toned colors I like to warm
up that transition and I'm trying not to
take it to too high what did the last
looks I did it was just kind of neutral
but I really did a good job of like not
taking the color too high and I loved
the way it turned out so that's gonna be
one of my goals today this is definitely
gonna be the highest color we're taking
into our eyes today onto our eyes into
our eyes whatever next I'm going to be
going in with this is Bellaire from
colour-pop I'm gonna go in with that and
I'm just going to be deepening up the
crease a little bit and not bringing it
again
too too high I know a lot of people have
found me through my Sephora what I'm not
surprised is on sale what I'm not
surprised the on sale yeah and it's so
crazy I did not think that video was
gonna like blow up like it did but that
is awesome I'm glad you guys found me
it's always great when a video that I
feel like is pretty similar to the rest
of your content gets a lot of views
because it really is like that's like
what you're gonna get with my channel
you know what I mean is like similar
content to that so yeah welcome everyone
me and Sam went to the happy place it
was a pop it's a pop-up here in LA it's
kind of like the ice cream museum I
don't know if you guys have seen that
all of your Instagram but if you are in
LA you see everyone go into the freakin
and ice cream museum and that thing is
so hard to get tickets to it's like oh
we sold out so I saw the happy place and
I was like you know what I'm gonna check
if there are tickets available cuz me
and Sam both took off Thursday to hang
out with each other so I was like let's
do that and it was available and I just
booked him I was like you know what
we're going and it was really cool if
you saw my
then you saw the like confetti room I
like use that as like my 20k like ah
crazy thank you because it was pretty
appropriate and honestly I had hit 20k
like she was right before I went to bed
the night before so I was like this is
like a perfect celebration but that was
kind of a fun thing I honestly feel like
pop-ups I don't know they're like an
interesting idea I would love to make my
own pop-up actually but um it was fun
it's just kind of expensive for what it
is but overall it was a good time okay I
really like that for the base that we
have going so next I want to go in with
the electric pop palette and we're gonna
take this first shade here which is the
color light and we're going to be
putting that all over the lid I'm using
a flat shader brush to do this
I have only swatched this stuff because
it literally came in the mail last night
I want to say the formula on these is
something I was not expecting it's
different from anything I've ever used
before so I'm not sure what the best way
to apply this is gonna be I'm gonna
spray my brush with whip mac fix+
because i couldn't even pick up anything
on the brush honestly this is not a
review of this palette this is like a
first impressions I just wanted to do a
look with it so that's what it looks
like on the brush let's see oh yeah
that's way better okay so I'm gonna put
this all over basically the first half
of my lid the texture of these shadows
is so strange it's almost like a cream I
don't know it's very interesting
I'm gonna use my finger now and try to
see like I don't know I'm gonna see if I
can get something going with my finger I
honestly suggest just using your finger
because that worked insanely well and it
worked
essentially the same way on the other
eye I've been liking a more glittery lid
lately but something I've noticed is
like they just make your eyes look so
aged I don't I don't there's nothing I
can do to help it now I'm gonna go in
with this and we're
to be kind of like layering that over
the white and into the outer portion of
the eye and I'm going in with a brush on
this cuz I want to kind of have a
feather effect and now that I have that
shadow lay down I'm just going to be
making sure that I can feather it into
the white and I might dip back and forth
until I get a blend that I'm like happy
with I think that blend looks pretty
good now I'm gonna go into this other
shade so we're gonna go in within pulse
now and we're gonna be putting this on
to the outer portion of the eye and
working it into the crease area we're
going for basically like an ombre now
that I haven't laid it down I'm gonna go
in and just kind of like work the crease
so I'm going in with this small crease
brush from elf just to kind of blend
things out and see where everything is
before I add more product and now I'm
just switching back between all the
colors of use to try to blend them into
a way I like them I'm just trying to get
a good blend
I always just love this eye so much more
why is that it's something I like to do
because I do have hooded eyes is I'll
like let my eyes go flat and then make
sure that the shape is even I could go
in with black and kind of like deepen
everything up but I kind of don't want
to I kind of want to leave it where it's
at so I feel good about where my eye is
right now let's do the rest of our face
and we'll see where we're at we'll
finish up the lower lash line and what
not it kind of stopped talking to you
guys sorry about that I just got into
the eye once you start putting like
blues and greens on your eyes like
things get serious you gotta like cancel
everything else out it's like shits
going down it could go bad it could go
amazing you just don't know um and we're
still crossing your fingers that this is
gonna look good I'm actually pretty
happy with the minimal amount of fallout
that I had I'm gonna just wipe away
whatever a little bit of fallout there
still is though just so we don't mix any
of those like purpley blues purpley
blues you mean like green blues I'm into
our foundation or into our concealer or
anything like that so because my eyes
have been
and like just like skin in general has
been oh my gosh what the Freak that is
the horriblest okay I must not have
locked the freaking product I got this
from actually too but um that's
disappointing I don't know how I like
that happen so I'm gonna have to clean
that up but I like this product because
it gives me a little bit more moisture
than like a concealer and I put like
entirely too much of it on because of
the fact that it exploded that sucks
okay um anyway I'm just going to be
gently putting this on you need like not
even half of what I put on but I've
really been using products that are more
moisturizing because my body needs it so
bad you guys
my face has just been so dry lately and
so today's look is definitely gonna be
more dewy I find that I gravitate to do
we looks in the winter because my skin
dries out more and I don't want a matte
look you know like I just feel like I'm
naturally already looking a little
questionable so like I'd rather have
some gradients then really emphasize any
dry patches patches help okay for primer
today I'm using my hard candy one but I
did to pot it cuz I'm almost done with
it so anyway I'm so excited about the
channels growth and you know I everyone
that's new and everyone that's here it's
just an exciting time um if your Creator
then I'm sure you know like growth is
just always exciting you know so I just
wanted to say welcome and thank you to
everyone the comments have been so nice
and so lovely and I've been enjoying
reading em so thank you and then just
some other exciting things that have
been happening in life I'm so excited if
you guys don't know I am a makeup artist
so that's what I do I do good work
that's all I do and then to me YouTube
is basically like a gig so yeah anyway I
worked on a short film last year it was
a thesis for AFI and right now I'm
putting on an illuminator this one's
from one over one she's gonna give us a
little bit of extra radiance underneath
our foundation and I will be applying
that with just an elf brush I did that
film it was a thesis film which means
it's like their final like film they're
working on
and I was really excited about it it was
called it's called a natural and it
deals with some pretty heavy topics but
that has been being submitted to film
festivals and everything and I'm super
excited to say that it was accepted to
like a really really huge one it's a
short film festival in France there's
like almost 9,000 submissions and only
73 made it and it's one of the 73 and
it's the only one from the United States
I believe so that is absolutely amazing
it's called the Clermont I wrote it down
because I knew I would never remember
it's the Clermont Ferrand for and
festivals so that is so exciting I am so
proud of everyone who worked on that
film and just excited to see it you know
being recognized and hopefully it'll
like win awards I don't know really what
happens so that is super sick guys
that's like exactly what you want to
happen if you're gonna work on one of
those projects so I'm happy for everyone
who worked on it the actors just
everyone involved it's so amazing when
everyone works really hard like that on
something and then it uh you know
prospers I have just like a little bit
more radiance to the skin it looks
really nice so now we can go in finally
with foundation I'm mixing two today I
usually mix my foundations but this one
is a tinted moisturizer and then I'm
going in with one of my favorites this
is the number seven City Light tinted
moisturizer if you can't tell I've been
using this actually a lot I kind of took
some crap about this because the first
time I used it it just was a very light
tinted moisturizer but again with my
skin being so dry it has been so nice
and me getting used to wearing less
coverage but I've been enjoying it and I
like mixing it with other foundations
that I can give less coverage to more
moisturizer too plus it has an SPF which
I enjoy so I'm just going to should I
use a Beauty Blender or yeah I'm just
gonna use my brush and just kind of put
a pretty light layer of this because I
find always when I add concealer it adds
just a lot of coverage to the look and I
don't want it too heavy I decided to
switch
to my beauty blender just to get a bit
more of like an even coverage I don't
know what's going on for concealer today
I'm gonna go in with the Estee Lauder
Double Wear this one's pretty nice and
thin and I'm gonna be taking this under
the eyes and also down the center of the
face and underneath the jaw line some
other things I'm working on a short film
this weekend I'm filming this on Friday
and I'm gonna be working Saturday and
Sunday and then we're gonna be here two
more days and then I'm leaving for
Arizona for the rest of the year so I'm
trying to film as much as possible on
those on that Monday and Tuesday so I
can hopefully just have a ton of footage
and then edit while I'm there and
continue doing daily uploads we'll see
how that works but I'm excited for this
short film - it's always fun doing
something that's like story based I also
with my channel I've decided that I'm
for January I'm going to be doing a know
by the whole month of January so it's
something I was like thinking about
doing and I kept thinking about it I'm
just gonna be setting my t-zone and
under my eyes with a translucent powder
but this is something I've been thinking
about doing for a long time and I I kept
like thinking of things to like stop
myself from doing it like reasons why I
shouldn't do the know by like oh what if
you get gift cards for Christmas or it's
your birthday month January is your
birthday month so you're gonna want to
buy makeup and you know they're just all
excuses I don't care about all that
stuff I'm not going to buy makeup in
January I'm gonna you know I can save
those gift cards for February first and
go buy stuff and I can do other things
for a birthday then get makeup I have
plenty of makeup I recently did that
haul video and that was a ton of stuff I
just got I just dropped a lot of powder
on floor I recently just got the palette
I'm using today like I just feel like I
have a lot of new makeup in my
collection and I want to give myself the
time to really explore it and use it and
give you guys good reviews and if I keep
bringing new stuff in all during January
I just don't think I'm gonna be able to
do that and so I thought this would be
the perfect time to exercise some
self-control do a no-buy and just
doing that makeup I have in my
collection start the year off right I
think it's like a great way to start the
new year I will be doing some videos
relating to this past year as well as
2018 sorry about that phone noise so
yeah I'm kind of excited I'm a little
bit nervous I haven't done I don't think
I know by like a a real know by before I
always just watch people and I'm like
fingers crossed for them I'm gonna be
setting the rest of my face with my
Clarins powder this is really nice and
doesn't add too much coverage and it'll
just set the face so I can actually
blend powders over the rest of my face
well see how that goes I think it'll be
successful I think it will be actually
less stressful because there's just no
thought that needs to be given to makeup
I I'm not buying anything I don't need
to think about the new releases in the
sense of like should I buy it should I
not is it worth it is it not does it fit
in my collection let me swatch out these
things like I don't need to even do any
of that because I know I'm not buying it
like at least not for that whole month
so there's no reason to worry about it
there's no reason to worry if it's gonna
sell out or not because I already know
I'm not gonna buy it during January so
if it sells out in January it sells out
like I think that'll be kind of freeing
in a way I'm gonna be using my hula
light today as my bronzer I haven't
really been using it this that much and
so I recently picked it back out to use
and it's nice I do like it it gives a
good amount of warmth without being too
warm I always go kind of crazy on my
forehead so we'll probably have to tame
that down and I've been loving this
brush from ELF this is the pointed
powder brush it's so good I'm liking
this I look I always like it oh my gosh
I'm sounding like a demon I always like
it so much more once I get the face done
it just pulls it together for blush I'm
using one of my favorites this is the
Tarte blush and party I thought this was
only in the birthday gift but you can
buy this separately if you really want
it but just wait for your birthday and
get it and not I find that I really
gravitate to like this same for blushes
and I guess I'm going a little heavy you
look nice
I'm gonna go in with a couple different
highlighters so first I'm going in with
this eye shadow from Urban Decay I am
panning this in my twelve pans of
Christmas so I really want to try to hit
pan on it I've definitely been putting a
lot of time in on this product so
hopefully I can hit pan I don't know
we'll see so I'm gonna put down kind of
almost like a base layer of highlighter
and then next we're going in with this
elf one this is the shimmering
highlighting powder in a pearl glow this
is something I got in my recent ELF
order which I will be doing like a haul
and review all in one coming up soon I'm
going a little bit heavier on
highlighter although I feel like I see
that in every video so maybe I just do
that now okay we're moving on to the
bottom lashes I'm so excited the first
thing I want to do is go in with a white
eyeliner I'm gonna be putting this in my
waterline as well as on my lower lash
line so that I can get a nice light base
so when we blend out that other blue
it's just gonna really pop I just want
that blue on the bottom I just want that
vibrancy I'm hoping that will work out
I'm gonna blend that out with a pencil
brush and then to add the color I think
I'm gonna go in with that same pencil
brush and just start working this color
mostly on the outer portion of the eye
and then we'll work it in I'm getting a
bit of Fallout so be careful and my
voice is cracking and I'm gonna take it
all the way right into the inner third
of the eye and I'm really just building
that color I'm really liking the way
that looks I'm gonna go in with a
highlighter palette this one's gonna be
from BH it's the black light one and
we're gonna take the shade clean with a
cake clean and we're going to put this
on the inner corner and also bring it
into that periwinkle we're really going
icy with this one
I'm not like in love with it on the
inner corner like I like it here but I
kind of want to bring back this white on
the inner corner so we're gonna try that
Stud I really like the way it looks
especially like that when the bottom
lash line light goes into the top we
think it looks really really pretty and
kind of cool I like also how it's not
super blended I don't know it looks
really good so the eye look is basically
done I'm gonna do a few things that I'm
gonna come back so I'm gonna put on my
mascara this one's the Urban Decay
perversion it's my favorite I'm gonna
tight line with my ELF brown pencil
which is like putting liner underneath
my lash line at the top and then I'm
also going to put on this lipstick which
is going to be kind of matching matchy
but I kind of still want to do it
this one is wicked forest from kiss it's
a really pretty color and yeah I'll be
back alright so I have everything done
this look turned out a little more Punk
than I thought it was going to but I
kind of like it I'm gonna go with it I
really hope you guys enjoyed this get
ready with me this is mostly how I do my
tutorials cuz I just like to talk a
little bit so yeah I will be doing a
full-on review of this palette hopefully
soon I'm gonna be doing probably a
palette review video or just a bunch of
different palettes I've gotten recently
and I'm going to talk about all of them
and just kind of give you some pros and
cons I'm just you guys can have the
information because I do have quite a
few at the moment and I'm still testing
them out I just want to like have really
solid thoughts so be on the lookout for
that that will be probably toward the
end of the month into the next year
honestly if I'm being honest alright
guys and that is everything thank you so
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
