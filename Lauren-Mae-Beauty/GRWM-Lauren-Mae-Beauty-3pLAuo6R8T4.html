of just woke up this first time I'm like
talking um I thought I would do a get
ready with me today I've never done one
of those where I'm just kind of like
getting ready and talking to you guys
we'll see if I have anything to talk
about but this is going to be a look
that I was wearing in my project pan
update number one video someone said
they liked the look and they'd like to
see it so this is going to be something
like that I honestly don't remember
exactly what i wore and that look so
this will be something very similar um
it's just a really easy easy look I'm
probably gonna go like full face man I'm
being so relaxed in this video um I'm
probably just gonna go full face and
show you everything for the most part of
my not to my brows just because we'd be
here forever but yeah let's just get
into it I already have all my
moisturizer and everything so we are
gonna go in with some primer i'm using
the last little bit up of my hourglass
mineral veil 1 i'm like digging in with
a brush right now so i'm going to do
that and then i'll come back I don't
know why they made the bottles like this
I don't know it's just evil that sucker
is done there's no way I can get any
more product out of it so i'm just i'm
putting what I scraped out on my face to
prime it um I'm just running errands
today I'm not doing anything too big so
you know I don't need it to last a super
long time I have to go to the pharmacy
and I also have to go and what i said
you owe target i do a target and get a
facial moisturizer and hopefully nothing
else fingers cries and um I need to get
lashes for my kit at school too so
that's what's on my agenda other than
that i'm cleaning all day oh so now I'm
going to take my Beauty Blender I've
already like got it wet and everything
and I'm gonna be mixed in my physicians
formula tinted moisturizer with this
Mary Kay ivory for liquid foundation
this is more full coverage obviously the
other one's attention moisturizer so
together I feel like they give me enough
coverage but nothing
crazy I am going to be putting more of
the like foundation and then I normally
do because usually I just spread this
out my fingers but lately I've really
been like in the beauty wonder and so
I'm going to like mix them together and
use the Beauty Blender to apply them it
just gives me such a nice finish on my
skin and that's what I love so I'm just
mixing that on the back of my hand
together with the back of a brush that's
what I do usually I usually always mix a
foundation either because of color or I
don't know I just I'm not happy with
just like one I don't know what it is so
I'm going to dot this actually just like
all over my face this is quite a bit i
probably won't even use all of this and
yeah i put it where I need it most I
think and then kind of just blend it out
from there it's weird cuz it's so bright
even though there's no Sun directly
shining on me it's just sunshine out but
yeah so I'm just using the beauty
blender to blend it in I used to not
like this i think because i felt like it
just took so long i don't want to sit
here and beauty blend my life away and
be doing this for like ever but i don't
know i just like i was saying in my
februari or I'm sorry my March favorites
video I just don't like the way that the
brush is like laying the foundation on
my skin and I happen for a long time I
realized because I was actually on
putting it on with my fingers way before
everything way before everything way
before I started using the Beauty
Blender and so I think I just was like
in denial I don't know um my skin is
just very difficult i feel so yeah i'm
gonna put another layer on just to
perfect it a little bit more
but we can always go in with concealer
too so don't I don't like to get too
cakey too much what else oh yeah
yesterday was Easter so me and Sam we
went up to Griffith Park which is in
Hollywood it's like up in the hills a
little bit it's by the Hollywood sign so
we went up there it was so busy and I
was thinking for some reason I don't
know why like oh it's Easter everyone's
gonna be doing other things you know
everyone was doing that so it was really
busy but um we parked at like the bottom
of the park and then we walked up to the
observatory which if you guys didn't
know there's like an observatory in
Hollywood um again up by the sign kind
of and it is i think it's called
griffith observatory i want to say and
it's free to the public and you can go
in they have like a telescope and stuff
that they actually like do scientific
crap with but you can go in and it's
kind of like a science center but all
about like space and stuff and it was
free and that was really cool I think
it's really awesome that California
offers I feel like there's so much to do
here and you just don't have to pay for
a long a bit like a lot of stuff is free
or there's always activities going on
since it's such a big city i don't know
i really i love that about about this
town so that's what we did yesterday and
it was a good hike i think it was i did
my MapMyFitness and it was like a to a
little over two miles but um I mean it
really wasn't too bad it was up like up
the hill so I can feel it in my legs now
but you know that's a good thing right
okay so I'm putting on concealer this is
the Maybelline fit me in the colour fair
and i just put that underneath my eyes i
do obviously is quite a bit and then i
also cover any areas that I don't feel
look very good and kind of just use
whatever is left on the wand for that
and then I guess to going back to that
story and there's a road that takes you
that was closed for 25 years or
something to the Hollywood sign that you
can
we didn't take it just because it was
really busy like it was so busy there
was so much traffic up there but um I
think it's closing the 12th so I really
want to try to go on that road before
they close it back down again I don't
know they're doing some type of test or
something I don't know there was a lady
kind of talking to us about a bit I
wasn't quite getting all of it but that
was really fun I thought it would be
nice to be kind of close to nature and
like it was such a beautiful day
yesterday um I don't know degrees wise
what it was exactly but it was just so
nice and it's it's hot but like just
warm enough to be nice out and then also
the wind is quite breezy and cool so
even if you were kinda in the Sun too
long once that breeze hits your you know
it's just beautiful especially when
you're hiking it was just absolutely
wonderful next I'm going in with this
tart a flushed cream cheek stain thing
I'm trying to use this up so I'll do an
update I'm doing an update after this so
whew that's a lot of color um yeah I'm
I'm really trying on this guy really
really trying this one's a difficult
little sucker because I just don't I
realize I just don't like to have that
in my routine it's just an extra step to
me like I like doing a really
extravagant makeup process and having a
lot of steps but like this isn't
extravagant this is just another step to
the next ends like oh it's not fun and
it's just like it's just a step i'm
using it up like I don't you can't
really see the color you can't a little
bit but like that's not enough for me
and then I just powder and then do
another blush oh I know you sticking
with project pan items I'm going to also
be using this what's up by benefit I've
been trying to like on the days I can
stomach it
I use quite a bit of this on my face and
I've been using it again the beauty
blunder has helped of both these items
because it's easier to blend out with
the Beauty Blender I feel like then with
my fingers and stuff so that's really
what I've been doing and just like
blending these guys out and it's been
helping me use them and not feel so bad
about using them but they're not I'm
over them I'm so over it I think that
happens though I mean that's just
natural for us to kind of get over it um
but I'm trying to push past and just at
least make it to my due date um and see
how far i get you know I don't know
that's what i tell myself anyway okay so
i just put that on my cheekbones on my
Cupid's bow and also on my nose and now
we are ready to powder this sucker i'm
going to be using this tart powder that
i've been trying to use up and i'm going
to kind of like how i use this just so
you guys know it's a good way is kind of
know what i do i use this flat brush by
elf and it's quite dense and I just like
kind of Pat it on my face I do I like a
lot of powder and a powder girl man um
and I know everyone says that it makes
you look dry and cakey but I think I
mean I get compliments on my skin quite
a bit I think it's just the way you do
it I don't know cuz that doesn't seem to
be my story i'm not saying every day I
don't or whatever everyone else does but
I don't I get a lot of compliments on my
skin so I don't feel like I'm doing
something wrong I think just
everything's in moderation and also just
technique and it just depends on what
kind of like look you like I like a
really matte look so that's what I do
this Hatter also is a little dark for me
but I've just been making it work I have
been getting more tan we've been hiking
the last two weekends now um so I
definitely have gotten some color I
don't know if I can show you my skin
camera it hasn't been too bad plus i
brought my face up so much hmm which i
like you know i'm not saying it looks
bad it just helps blend it right it
takes a long time this is the long
process guys I also feel like when I
powder it more densely like this and
really locking in that foundation and
setting it so that it hopefully doesn't
go anywhere cuz that's the goal always
okay now I didn't set under my eyes I
don't know if you noticed that I was
kind of skipping that area so what I've
been doing lately I've been using this
bourgeois powder I got this in France
when we were there I got a lot of stuff
in France i'm telling you we went once
and i didn't get anything and then I got
into makeup and I was so disappointed
like Lauren you could have got so much
awesome stuff so when we went back I
made sure that I got what I needed we
were like on the hunt Sam was so sweet
he was like helping me find bioderma
like all this stuff it was yeah you know
life of a beauty addict so we're going
to put that underneath our eyes i'm just
using this elf brush this is a mineral
powder brush and I'm just taking some of
that loose powder and I am like swishing
it around in the capsule it kind of
works its way into the brush and I'm
making sure to with my finger that
there's no creasing then I'm setting
that dry area and this one does have
some like light reflecting light
refracting light reflecting particles in
it and that's why I've been really
liking it plus have just been trying to
use it up and it's been working out for
me there's like powder everywhere we are
done with that part not bad you did it
guy so now let's go into bronzer this is
how i do my face on the normal day to
like order wise unless I know for sure
that I'm going to be doing a really
heavy I look what this is not i'm using
my too faced chocolate soleil bronzer
and this Real Techniques brush which
I've had this one forever I do need to
get anyone just because the ends are
kind of like frayed and weird but
I mean I guess it's still working for me
cuz i still use it and I just like
lightly kind of um putting that in the
areas that I want to be a little bit
bronzer and I am contouring just a
little I mean it's like a light contour
kind of weight really wide I don't know
I just wash my brushes so I think the
shape on this one was a little different
than I was expecting but that's ok we
will make it work and I bring that down
my neck as well because if not I feel
like it won't blend so i will say doing
tutorials and stuff out here in my
living room is so weird for me because i
always get ready in the bathroom and I
have to like use a little mere and I'm
used to having like a full-blown mere
I'm not used to that yet it's so
freaking weird for me but I'm trying I
think that's all the bronzing on like my
face I'm gonna do the tiniest bit of
bronzing on my nose so I just use that
same powder i dip in there barely with
this like duo fiber Real Techniques
brush and I feel like this I just
basically go down the side and kind of
like darken up the side that's it that's
what I do I mean this isn't a super
precise contour and I wouldn't say I'm
trying to like correct anything i just
like the definition it gives I don't
know I don't know I just like it so I do
it so that's that we're going to do some
blush I'm going really basic on
everything today um just because I'm
really trying to use up some items and
you know you get away from them then
it's like you got to come back or you're
going to be screwed later on so i'm
using my lilia blush by michael todd and
just this angled blush brush this is
what I use on the daily and just roughly
but I'm not everywhere on my cheeks um
I'm a blush person I like a lot of blush
I know I like a lot of everything
hello look at me this one especially
like I love blushes you don't really
have to like worry about too much
because it sucks when you like get too
much blush on your brush or on your face
it's really hard to blend out like you
can do it but it's really difficult and
I know everyone's like oh it's so
pigmented but I like blushes like that
but so many of them it's like sometimes
it's nice just have like an everyday one
that you know you're not gonna like
completely ruin your look because you
did it really faster you were in a hurry
other blushes are crazy like they're
crazy so we're a highlight because I
going to do a powder highlight as well
as that benefit 1 i'm using this Stila
one and i'm using the pink shade in this
and i'm using this fan brush by elf this
is a really just small little fan brush
so and i'm not very precise I'm just
kind of like put it on the tops of my
cheekbones exactly and I kind of like
bring it up on the side of my face a
little I put it down the center of my
nose no big deal and also over my cupid
zones and ends I'll just take the extra
liquid now it's redder and just put them
in those places on my forehead and my
chin and that's everything um for face
I'll be right back i'm gonna go do my
eyebrows and then i'll be right back I
have successfully finished my brows look
how much definition there is already to
my face a little bit i'll use my brow
quad my Anastasia brow Wiz in the color
dark brown and also the stiff angled the
stiff angled brush if you guys want to
see a brow routine let me know i know i
always go off camera but i don't know
i'm not like a Braille expert that's for
sure so feel a little intimidated to do
a brow routine i'm using my tart cream
eyeshadow to prime my lids um also too
it's funny being in school now we
learned how to make the perfect eyebrow
and they always say you know as a joke
like browser meant to be sisters not
twins or cousins or whatever that saying
and she's like no they're supposed to
match and so you know we learned how to
make the perfect brow and like the
measurements you're supposed to use
based on the face and stuff but it's
kind of intimidating because I realize
like you know I do my eyebrows and I
like them and I feel like other people
like them too you know they're not like
super controversial anyway I don't know
if I really make them according to that
thing which I think that's something I'm
learning to as I'm in school just like
makeup is a tool to help aid you in
whatever you're trying to do if that's
like enhanced features or make it look
pretty but it's also like an art form
and it's great to know i guess like
science or something behind makeup and
different things you can do to help get
a desired look like if you want to
correct like corrective contouring or um
making your lips look the same size if
they aren't or if you have wrinkles how
to like make the illusion of you know
the illusion of like bringing attention
to a different part of your face or just
different things like that I'll my nails
are long and the cream shadow got
underneath manual and that totally
grosses me out oh I'm gonna cut them off
okay anyway I think that it's awesome
for that but it's also like an art and
like yeah you're supposed to put
eyeshadow here but I think it's fun to
experiment and do different things and
not necessarily listen to that um anyway
that's just how I feel so I'm going to
sue me guys in so you can see what I'm
doing to my eyes I'm gonna go in with
this eyeshadow for Mac this is kid what
are you putting that in my crease I'm
going for a kind of golden ask Toby look
today that's kind of what I was wearing
in that video it was just really basic
nothing too warm or anything so I'm
going to be putting that in the crease
first I like the shadow a lot because
it's very neutral like I don't know
something about this I shown is really
nice and I'm not a super map person not
because I don't like it it's just I
haven't tried it I just think it's so
expensive
no Mac is just really expensive to me
you're not saying it's not worth it or
the quality but it just I don't know if
I'm going to spend $16 I'll just spend
it somewhere else usually I think to I
know that like people that work there
and professionals and stuff get such a
good discount mac that it hurts me to
pay full price for it I don't know that
I feel like they're lowering their
prices a little bit or at least I think
pan shadows are not like 10 and they
used to be 12 or something maybe I made
that up I don't know but I don't know I
kind of want to branch into Mac more but
I kind of don't i don't know i'm always
torn and then i also hate to like they
have awesome limited edition stuff but
it sells out so fast and it's not like
sephora selling out it just is gone once
it's sold out and it's like I don't want
to stay up until like seriously like
four in the morning to like get the
Cinderella freaking quad or the six and
one I really wanted that but it's like
psycho like that's crazy and it sells
out just so fast like a it's insane to
me like there's not even like oh five
days or something it's just gone it's
gone um okay sorry for my rant i guess
i'll just show you i'm gonna go in up
this is a lot of mac shadows but i'm
gonna go in with rice paper by mac it is
like a golden shimmery one um yeah
that's what I'm gonna put on the lid
just to give us some shimmer and it kind
of plays up that cream shadow a foot
down cuz that one is a golden color I'm
putting it in the first like third or so
on my lid I thought I would mention in
this video to like I'm super excited
about my channel and just like the
growth that I've made so much so far I
mean I'm almost at like 150 subscribers
which like blows my mind mcfreaks me out
and now it's not even a ton but then
it's also like so many when you think
about how many people are out there and
just like I can't believe that anyone
watches my videos and like likes them or
even want I mean just even watch them
like whether they like them or not they
chose to click on it out of like
hundreds of
thousands a video with its crazy and I
was so nervous to do youtube for a long
time like I want to do YouTube like
years ago like I want to say like a year
and a half almost two years ago and I
finally just would like the move and
everything did it and I'm just so happy
I did and it's definitely not as scary
now like I used to be scared to talk to
the camera and now i'm sitting alone in
my apartment doing my makeup talking to
a camera like it's just insane to me but
um I'm just really excited and I still
really love it and it's awesome I don't
know I everyone's so sweet to that I've
like talked through the internet to on
the commons and stuff it's just
wonderful I'm going to go in with
grandstand by makeup geek I'm just
putting out on the outer like one-third
oh I guess I'll hold it back here on the
outer one third of my eye it's kind of
like a topi topi a brown color but yeah
I just I guess I wanted to say like
thank you to everyone who's been so
supportive and so kind and just like you
know been watching my videos it's just
so sweet of you I just love it it's just
awesome I'm just really glad that I kind
of broke out of my shell and decided to
do it and didn't look like the fear stop
me from doing this because it's so fun
and I just I love makeup like I love it
I love talking about it and it gives me
a place that I can talk about it and I
feel like actually help people instead
of talking to Sam about makeup because
he doesn't really care I mean he's nice
and he loves me and he'll listen to me
but it's not benefiting him in any way
at all okay so i'm just going to this is
not very similar to that look I don't
think I don't know well I kind of I
remember doing something like this so I
hope this is close enough I'm sorry
I'm really sorry I just don't quite
remember i'm taking that brush we use
before just kind of blending out the
outer edge yeah i feel like this is way
different I thought this was what I did
though I thought I use that color but I
think I used a different one ok anyway
I'm going to take this flat shader and
I'm going to go in with just a matte
cream color I think it's the color
cracker by stars makeup Haven and I'm
going to be putting that under my brow
bone I'm kind of mixing it with vanilla
by Mac um just to make it a little
lighter and I'm just going to put that
again under the brow bone I like an ice
cream I light under there I think it
looks so good and we're gonna once again
blend blend blend blend blend blend
blend what else can I talk to guys out
you finished dexter i know i told you
guys that in my March favorites we're
kind of a fail video um but we did
finish that and I did really enjoy it
again I'm not going to get too much into
it but now we have started a couple
different shows we've been watching this
show it's called I'm never custom a
channel but it's called and it
is with Penn &amp;amp; Teller it's a super old
show and we're just watching out on
amazon prime but um that's like
interesting it's just like a fun one
they just kind of like call out
different like movements or whatever so
I don't know I I enjoy it i think it's
just fun um I'm not necessarily like
four against all the opinions and every
every show but that's something we've
been watching what else we've been
watching um drunk history which is also
just like a fun one sometimes you don't
want something so heavy and it's like
it's hilarious let me go on to my next
makeup item so than that I'm gonna
um looking at my trove of items only I
grabbed the wrong one whatever I guess
we'll just use this this is a chart
liner in brown up with this on my lower
lash line I'm gonna be putting this on
my water on my tight lines of black one
by make it forever um yeah but anyway so
what they do is they have these
comedians and nails I mean I'm guessing
sent them like um a story like a
historical story to memorize or two what
about and then they get them super drunk
and then they like retell that story so
it don't maybe be like how let's for
example how the Boston Tea Party
happened or something like that but then
of course they're wasted and then um
they'll also have oh my gosh it's so
difficult they'll also have people like
acting out what they're saying but
they're using their voice but they like
act it different characters it's really
funny obviously not everyone's cup of
tea so sorry if you don't like that type
of stuff I'm usually honestly not into
really crass or stuff like that I mean I
don't even drink really myself at all um
but it is pretty funny I think it's a
funny concept I look insane I don't know
where the lid 10 here is lost it's a
pretty funny show I mean if you think
that would be funny to you I check it
out if not sorry my camera shut off who
knows how long that happened for anyway
I'm just tight lining I never tight line
like this just throwing that out there I
got a little on our lid but that's okay
we're just going to go with it wiped a
little off we're good good to go now
we're going to mass care up our lashes I
really don't know how much didn't film
oh yeah I'm so bad at that I'm gonna put
some mascara on my lashes i'm using the
this video send me so psycho i'm using
the benefit roller lash everyone loves
this mascara i like it too i think it's
really good the thing that I don't like
about it is I feel like it doesn't dry
so I like that it's not crispy
lashes but at the same time it also like
just never dry so if you go touch him
later on they'll stick together and I'm
not into that I don't know I haven't
heard anyone mention that part about it
like I don't know maybe I'm just like
weird picking up my lashes I don't know
why I'm touching her lashes I'm noticing
this but I am I just I don't know I'm
not saying I wouldn't use it i have
another sample still but i just don't
know if i'd pay for it and I I just
think that's like a negative thing that
