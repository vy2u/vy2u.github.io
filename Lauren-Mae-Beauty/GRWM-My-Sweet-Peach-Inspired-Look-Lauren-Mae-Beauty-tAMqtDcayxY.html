Lauren this tutorial is going to be all
about like a peachy kind of look I
really wanted to a sweet peach palette
and as the release day got closer and
closer and I saw all the swatches I
realized that the amount of peach shades
in there aren't that many there's a lot
of neutrals which I already haven't
really enough and so it got me thinking
about creating a look with peach shades
I already have in my collection I used a
pop of peach like on the inner part of
my eyes and then kind of just went with
it so I feel like if I had the peach
palette this is the look I would have
created with it I would have brought in
all these extra shadows and just used
the peach shades so if you have the
peach palette or if you just want to try
some peach shades or just this look then
I think you'll definitely like this
tutorial and if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep watching so
I am starting off with a fresh face I
have moisturized and I'm going to go
into prime I have quite an intense
priming routine at the moment so I'll
just get into it the first thing I'm
going to prime with is the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer this is
my favorite primer ever I use this just
in the areas I need to control texture
and filling pores I probably use more
than I need to but I like it so I mostly
hit my nose my chin and then my cheeks
and then I just kind of blend that out
the next primer I'm going to use is this
long from Stila this is the one-step
prime color and kitten and this is a
more luminous primer so I do like to
keep this on like the high points of my
face and then blend the excess into
basically where I plugged it the first
primer on my face I like to dab it on
the cheekbones down the nose on the
forehead and the chin and then just kind
of like the jaw bone and then just blend
and as I blend I'll bring it like in to
my cheeks and stuff my lines up for
priming I know it's like oh this is the
Clinique super primer this just to me
kind of gives my gosh
this gives just an overall nice blend to
the skin I use about that much I just
like the way it feels over those primers
those ones sometimes I feel it can be a
little drying and although I am oily I
sometimes feel like if my skin isn't
perfect or if I broke it out like stuff
can cling to dry patches so this just
kind of gives me one more kind of layer
of smoothness for my foundation that go
on or perfect everything is going to be
like a big step in this one so these are
my foundations I'm going to be mixing a
little bit of each of these I know again
kind of psycho I usually do mixed up and
I change up my foundation routine all
the time unless I have something in a
project so I have recently finished up
the one I was using on a project so now
kind of just do whatever I want and I
used to use this combination all the
time before I got into powder foundation
so I'll be using like a squirt of my
number 7 beautifully matte foundation
and this is in the color cool vanilla
and that one's a little dark for me even
though it's a light shade and it's
pretty cool then I'm going to use a
little bit of the gorgeous cosmetics
base perfect foundation I really like
this foundation this is lighter so it
helps to balance out that darkness and
it is still cool though has a pinky
undertone and then last I'm using the
make it forever
echh Ultra HD and this is in 117 and
this is lighter basically my exact skin
tone but it is more yellow so kind of
counteracts all those Pink's so I'm
going to take like a custom mix of that
and then I'm gonna go in with my Beauty
Blender sorry it's a little dirty but I
keep it in this cute little cup I got
from Target it's super cute I thought
I'd just show you but it's already damp
and I'm going to blend it out on my
whole face with the beet loader so once
I have all three of those on my hand I
just kind of use my finger to swirl them
around use my hands kind of as
Aled then I like to gab whatever was on
my finger put it straight on my face
start blending with that and then I go
in just from my hand from there and I am
freaking out right now I seriously don't
understand why I even have like a
breakout on my forehead which doesn't
make sense like I'm used to getting
around my jawline because there are
hormonal or like stress-related but
their forehead so I feel like I'm just
struggling to have my skin look at some
he says I'm used to not only on my
foundation I'm gonna go in with my Forge
walk bronzing primer just to do a little
cream contouring this is quite a warm
bronzing type of product but I still
really enjoy it I think it looks nice on
my skin and I'm just using this Smashbox
brush that came with the Smashbox
contouring trio I'm pretty sure it's not
synthetic so but I still use it with
this product so I'm just going to put
this on like my cheekbones kind of heavy
I put it on just like the temple area of
my forehead I do go down my nose and as
you can tell I do go a little bit above
my jawline with it or I'm like jawbone
my cheekbone geez just because I want to
give the illusion of more raised
cheekbones so now I'm gonna blend that
out with my blender
so that's what I look like after I have
contoured now I'm going to go in with
the concealer I'm using the Maybelline
age rewind and this is in the color of
fair
I mean we're putting this under my eyes
to highlight and just conceal as well as
other high points of my face if I go in
with a contour like to highlight as well
just to keep it balanced
and I do usually it depends on the day
but I use quite a bit of product every
day just cuz if I'm gonna do makeup I
just like to play you know so now I'm
just blending it out with Beauty Blender
now that I have that all done I'm going
to go in and set my face I'm going to be
using an a translucent powder this is
the it cosmetics bye bye pores I'm
trying to use again use this up and to
put that on my face I'm gonna be using
this elf brush I don't know the name and
it used to have a stick but now it's
just like a kabuki brush I just have not
gotten to replace one of this but these
are like three dollars the reason I like
this brush is cuz it's a flat top and so
I can easily I don't like to like swirl
stuff on my skin when I'm setting my
foundation because I don't want to mess
up what I just did so I like to like
really press it into the skin and so I
really like how flat this is I can
really you know dab the powder into my
skin I just go under the eyes usually
first just so they aren't crazy and then
I just get the rest of my face
I do use quite a bit of powder I am
pretty oily it's just like whole white
off to touch up as much there of the day
type of situation for me I hope I was
recording but I just brought it up my
face using my Smashbox trio contour trio
is the bronze shade in the middle just
to warm up my face I kind of took it on
the outskirts of my face again just to
kind of liven up and get ready for
contour I really hope that was recording
I am feeling it wasn't also my hair up
because I just usually don't have my
hair down when I do my makeup at all
it's always up so it's keep getting it
it's in the way so now I'm gonna go in
to contour just a little bit I'm gonna
be using this brush from Sigma this is
the angled large angled contour and I'm
gonna go into the contour shade and I'm
just gonna keep this really far back on
my in the hollows of my cheek closest to
my ear and just kind of like place it
there and then blend out that's the only
place I contour I kind of sometimes
bring it down my
jawline just to slim the face and I
don't do like a super precise contour
now I'm gonna go in with this luck see
Beauty small contouring brush it's the
512 and I'm gonna use this and do my
nose just a little bit I'm just gonna
blend out the contour my nose just a
little bit with my powder brush now I'm
gonna go in to do my brows I'm going to
be using the Maybelline definer brow and
this is just an easy pencil I already
went through one of them I go through
these so fast but I just like how small
the tip is so that's why I'm using this
one I'm just gonna try to fill them in
as well as I can and
I'll just shut off I'm gonna turn
another one in this video though likes
areas sorry the lighting is different
that's my eyebrows done with just the
brow pencil now I'm going to go in with
a powder I'm gonna use the more ashy
toned color here for my starlooks brow
quad and I'm just gonna go in with a
stiff angled liner brush and I'm going
to just darken up the outer portion
because I am going to be doing it just a
little bit of color on the front of the
brows I did this PG like yesterday and
I'm just kind of doing a version of it
I'm gonna add colorful brow just because
I thought it'd be more fun to it
for the inner part of my brows I'm gonna
be going in with the color pop shadow I
thought I would try to use this and two
kind of falls into that peachy pink
range this is the color animal and I'm
going in with just a separate angled
stiff angled brow brush just so I don't
have to clean the other one and I'm
going to be putting this in my brows I
haven't ever put it in my brow before so
we'll see how it handles hopefully it
looks good right and I want the color
strongest like here the brows kind of
like I normally do this also is like
glitter in it it's kind of balling up a
little bit I'm just gonna kind of stop
it there and go in with a different
thing so I'm just gonna do the same
amount on the other brow and then I'll
just use a different product that really
sucks I'm really disappointed that I
can't use it that way I was really
excited to I'm just gonna go into the
blush we're gonna be using on the eyes
so I'm just gonna go in with my original
brow powder brush and put that in the
brows over that color of eyeshadow oh my
gosh I just put colour-pop shadow on my
nose do you see that oh so what I caught
it right now I would have gone through
the entire video I think we're okay now
jeez it's a disaster in this video and
I'm gonna be kind of strong in the front
because that's again where I want that
color yeah we can now set them and just
be done I never have to touch our brows
again I'm taking the Anastasio clear
brow gel and just going to run that
through my brows so that they stay on it
then we get onto the eyes already my
cool I'm gonna prime my eyes using the
by Terry hyaluronic eyeprimer and I do
use the shade one light I think I have
the other one as well I really like this
I think it works really well although I
suggested it for my mom so she bought it
and she did not like it and the reason I
like this is because I can definitely
feel like it evens out my not only the
texture and like the color but I feel
like it pumps a little with that
hyaluronic acid and that's what it's
intended to do and I thought I thought
it'd be great for my mom because she is
older and so you know just to kind of
give some more density to her lid but
she did not like it she said it didn't
work well but she loves the Fergie one I
got the Fergie one I think his amber F
talks about a lot so I saw that I'm
clean it's at Target I picked it up for
her and she like loves that one so
anyway I'm gonna set that and I'm just
going to be using the palette I've been
using as a mirror and I'm an easy color
frame that's kind of just a
I'm skin shade and I it's like to set my
primers just to make sure I can blend as
easy as possible over them next I'm
going back in with my blush and I'm
going to be putting that on the whole
crease of my eye again just kind of
tucked just kind of loosely just
everywhere again I kind of want the more
main focus of it to be here you know how
I do and I just like was inspired by the
Too Faced sweet peach plus this is a
two-faced product in general this blush
and I just thought I don't know why not
this is basically what I feel like I
would do if I had that peach palette I
would do this look with those colors
though so this is kind of like a peachy
pink color you could definitely use
something that's more orange now that I
feel like that's pretty blended all over
I'm gonna go in with Viola rock pro and
I'm gonna be using a mix between the
shade
taupe and stable and I'm just gonna kind
of dark enough just the outer portion
again I do my eye looks very similar to
each other it's just the way I like to
apply my products I'm going to be using
kind of like a 2:17 that other brush was
at 40 I don't know what it was the same
brush let's see
efore am sorry ii 24 eyes hello and I'm
just going to kind of deepen it out I
don't want to make it too deep though
because I am going for a pretty soft
look today I was trying I have to go to
warm
so I feel like all my look super warm so
you think instead of something like
caramel but if you were more inclined
for something like that you could
totally new sections honestly that's
just with taupe right now and I kind of
like that so I'm going to go if I let
shade in if I want to deepen it up I'll
go those people out there I'm gonna be
using a base for this look this is the
NYX jumbo eye pencil in the color 610
waster I'm gonna be keeping that mostly
focused on the inner portion of my leg
but and kind of fading it off as I go
outwards and this is just the base for
the shadow of pigment shadow that's
really iridescent and I just wanted to
pick up on that purple Sheen I didn't do
the face yesterday I did the pigment
without the base and I just felt like it
didn't pop as much so I thought for the
tutorial I would spice it up a little
now that I put it in to apply the
pigment I'm going to be using the
concealer of 60 I'm sorry FB at 70 brush
and
I'm gonna be going in with this pigment
from bareMinerals this isn't the color
Oh natural bits are really pretty just
soft iridescent color it's hard to show
on camera so I apologize but I'm not
gonna want it I find it just clumps up
when I wet it so I'm just gonna use it
on the brush and just kind of tap off
the extra and just hope that the base
will stick it on enough so I think
that's good enough for me I'm going to
go in with again a mix of taupe and
sable just to kind of deepen up the
outer corner and then I am gonna go back
in with that blush as well as a peachy
shades though like more orange just to
kind of punch up the peach a little bit
punch up the peace because right now
it's just looking like fairy princess
and I love that one but I did wanted a
little more peach for my peach
reinforcement I'm going into the
California roll pallet from when wild
I'm just taking the orange
deepening out the outer corner again
just cuz I wanted to contrast trough
with that really like peach so I don't
want it to look like there's a peach
everywhere to highlight I'm just gonna
use a that would just like a shader
brush I'm gonna go in with buff from the
lorac pro 2 palette and I'm just going
to put that underneath the arch of the
brow bone and blend out and then just
kind of try to blend it in use it as a
blending tool this look is very similar
in colors to my one I had on Instagram
that was like oh I do my like panning
pro tagging it too I'll live video link
down below with that look in it so if
you wanted that look you could
definitely make this kind of work that
way for you now I'm gonna go in and
tightline with my Stila Convertible
color eyeliner in the color indigo and
I'll be back I'm not gonna add the
bronze Mary Kay liner to my lower lash
line and smudge it out with my fingers
now I'm gonna take the same brush I used
to do my brow bone highlight this is
just from the vice palette so again it's
just kind of like a more fluffy shader
brush it's not super thin and I'm going
to go in with a mix of that peach shade
from the wet wild palette as well as the
blush and I'm just going to kind of
really roughly blend that underneath my
lash line kind of more smoked out and
then I'm gonna go in and use taupe to
kind of define it more closer to the
lash line I promise in my next tutorial
I won't use like a pink color now I'm
using my dense little shader brush to
take again that taupe color and a little
bit of sable and just run that closer to
my lash line for more definition last
but not least I'm gonna be using just a
domed pencil type of brush and the color
snow from the lorac pro 2 palette and
I'm going to be using
the inner corner as well as the very
inner portion of the lower lash line
I've really been liking this color for
the inner corner it's just so bright and
I switched on my brush just to get a
little bit more precise it's kind of
like a smudge brush just to really put
it on that lower lash line now I'm gonna
go in the end line my waterline with the
white Kajal liner from Stila in the
color pearl now I'm gonna add some
mascara again I'm using the Milani lash
trifecta really been liking this yellow
no I did not put any blush on yet so I'm
going to use the same blush from Too
Faced it's all about this blush and I'm
just going to put quite a bit of this on
my cheeks I do not bring a highlighter
up here so I'm going to use let's see if
I can find something out here all ready
I'm gonna take the tiniest bit of nude
from my lorac Pro palette and I'm gonna
stamp it in there but then kind of stamp
it off on my hand and I'm using the elf
mineral powder brush and just kind of
lightly dust by cheek bones is this
really pretty as a highlight going down
the center of my nose I just do the
excess on my forehead and then I am
do a little like Cupid's bow and also on
my trip I'm gonna keep it simple for
this look for lips I'm just gonna use a
gloss this is the marvelous Moxie gloss
and rebel from bareMinerals I just
thought it would be kind of sweet and
not too much item on anything too harsh
or anything so I'm just gonna put my
lips are a little card and Foundation a
white ball I can't okay guys that it's a
final look I really hope you enjoyed
this tutorial and I hope that this gave
you some inspiration if you have the
peach palette or if you're wanting to
use peach colors or even if you just
want to use like a blush as an eyeshadow
I really like this look I think it's
just really fine it's kind of sweet
and I really like it so I hope you guys
do too I will see you in the next video
bye guys
