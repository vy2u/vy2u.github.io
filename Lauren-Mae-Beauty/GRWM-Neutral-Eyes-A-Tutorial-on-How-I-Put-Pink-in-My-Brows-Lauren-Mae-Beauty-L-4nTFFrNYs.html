Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a get ready
with me and I just wanted to do
something neutral someone asks for like
a neutral look and I know a lot of my
lips are usually I mean a bit unwearable
obviously for me I wear them out but I
understand that not everyone wants to
put pink or you know red although I am
also at the end of this going to add the
pink in my brow so you guys can know how
I do that I get a lot of requests on
that tooth so I thought this would be
kind of like a two-in-one I don't know I
also wanted to test this product out now
this is not like a new product
I was not like sent this in anyway or
anything like that I've had it for a
really long time and I just have never
busted it out it's from Dalton and it is
a spinning brush I don't know how I feel
about this so we're gonna try it out I
don't know we'll see if it works I just
thought why am i keeping this in a box
just like not using it I should try it
out if I like it then use it if I don't
get rid of it and pass it on instead of
just having clutter so so that's kind of
my thoughts with that I'm gonna be
priming my face of my lifestyle primer I
am going to be using a stick foundation
today and I find that this primer just
really does a good job of giving a nice
really smooth base for stick foundations
to easily blend on top of and I find
that it kind of shares them out of it
which is something I actually like I
have pretty good skin but I do have
redness and so I like to just use
foundations to even that redness out but
I still want to try to keep the same
texture and look on my skin of my skin I
always put way too much primer on when I
film these get ready with me so I don't
know what my problem is but it's always
entirely way too much I already threw
the box away but I do have the
instructions it says start with a small
amount of product less is more for
liquid makeup use your finger to apply
directly to forehead cheeks nose and
Chin's for powder make sure you brush
off as you dab the brush head and
directly the makeup and then tap off any
extra if doesn't even give you the
option of using a cream or a stick
foundation so we're just gonna test it
out so I'm using three different ones
today I know I'm like freaking extras
hell I'm going to be a
some of the hourglass which I really
love this one but the shade is not my
shade it's pretty yellow so I'm just
going to be putting some of this on my
face and I know I talked all that crap
about like wanting to share coverage I'm
not sure what kind of coverage we're
gonna get because I might go to ham and
put too much stuff on this one is from
laura geller
and it's definitely probably the most my
actual tone but it's a little light and
then the last one here is my lamb come
one and I mean that's all I have left
guys it's crazy I use this a lot over
Christmas break at my mom's house
Christmas break like I'm in school still
this one is really nice and I think this
one matches me pretty well too it just
can look a little dark depending all
right so we're really gonna put this
thing to the test and see if I can do
something like the weirdest thing I
think that I'm gonna also move the
brushes I don't know I'm barely touching
it to my skin I don't know if I should
just okay I'm not gonna move the brush
on that's gonna move it like that
I mean it's definitely blending it in
and I'm not really it's I'm definitely
letting the brush do the work I thought
it was kind of funny because this brush
I had not used it but you could tell it
wasn't like really white at the ends I
think they did that so that it's like
you know it'll look clean
you know when it's dirty do you know I
saying it looked like it was almost
dirty I don't know it'll never get back
to the same place
I need another thing but I hope you guys
understand all right let me finish up
half of my nose here it's actually
really soft I just feel kind of like
extra about this so I think that it
looks super beautiful I think my skin
looks really good maybe I'll zoom in
really fast I really hope this is in
focus but my skin looks really really
good and I feel like coverage wise it's
not too much coverage so I'm very happy
about that I'm gonna blend in this other
side
so you just back out and I'm actually
really okay that's probably really
irritating together I'm actually really
happy with how a my foundation looks I
don't think that I have too much like
coverage or anything I think it blended
out really beautifully it took a little
bit of time that's the only thing like I
feel like it could have gone faster with
something different but I really like it
if you're looking for a full coverage
like brush situation I definitely don't
think that's gonna be it and I probably
would never purchase it but I thought it
was gonna be kind of crappy I'm not
gonna lie like really gimmicky and
stupid but I think it looks really nice
like I think my skin looks pretty damn
good so surprised I thought that I would
also use the bronzer stick for a milk
that I love and use the brush to kind of
blend it in and see how it goes because
I do prefer a brush with this product
sometimes a beauty blender just doesn't
quite do the trick put a little under my
chin I have a feeling it will do well
considering the first thing
yeah it does it works really well I feel
like I'm like chiseling away on my nose
right now that sound effects I really
love that I feel like I can barely touch
my skin and it really does get blended
out
all right I'm very pleasantly surprised
at that actually I can't believe that I
like it I'm just gonna use my Milani
concealer for under my eyes and I don't
think I really have too many spots that
are showing through or at least showing
through enough for me to really do
something I'm gonna put a little on my
nose though so I hope you guys have been
well I'm really excited because today
I'm feeling quite a few videos in a lot
of different ways so I'm going to be
filming some where my faces and in them
so I'm going to intermix when I don't
have my face in the videos and when I do
and I'm doing my normal like setup so
yeah that'll be cool I have my makeup
empties coming up I have my Creator on
the rise coming up which I have grown so
much once again from creator on the rise
but I think that video is gonna be
really insightful in it I'm excited to
do it because so much has changed
I feel like about how I feel about
YouTube because of creator on their eyes
and not in a bad way that's the sound I
like weird but um I just I have like a
new perspective entirely when it comes
to just different things with YouTube
and something that's really weird is I
have to kind of change my mindset of
like my channel in the sense that like
I'm not as small as I used to be but
it's really weird because I still think
of myself as small because I don't feel
like I've had a lot of time to really
take in the growth I guess I hate
talking about this every single time I'm
on my channel so I'm sorry
it's just definitely something that's
different for me and yeah just something
that's like constantly in my life I'm
sitting under my eyes and then I'll be
setting my face with a Lorimer I was
watching Laura Mercier but a laura
geller
product anyway so I can't wait to like
talk to you guys about that I'm like
kind of let you guys in on some
insights that I've had the pros and cons
of creator on the rise because I think
it seems like it's only like a good
thing but there are definitely some
things that I just wasn't expecting to
happen and I think it'll be like a nice
fun like science project type of video
so the Laura Gillard Foundation I've
been using a lot is this one in
porcelain and I don't like to use too
much of this because it is a little bit
light for me but I do think this gives
just a little bit of extra coverage if I
feel like I need it it sets my face and
it looks like skin it really does look
so beautiful and I've been enjoying the
finish of it all the other powders that
I have with a similar finish to this are
too dark for me at the moment so it's
been nice using this guy so as you guys
know I'm on my no bi and it's been kind
of difficult actually I was really
pumped for it and I still am but I have
been like wanting to buy not even makeup
I really want to try some skincare out
Sephora is selling the dice iam is how
you say it I don't know you guys know
what I'm talking about they're selling
their line or at least part of their
line so I really want to try some of
that skincare stuff
it's inexpensive which is something that
is a plus for me and I kind of want to
try to get more into skincare I feel
like my main goal with my skincare
recently has just been to moisturize and
I really want to try out some acids I
want to try out just stuff that's
actually going to help reverse signs of
aging I'm still young don't get me wrong
I just want to actually be trying to
like fix the texture on my skin or you
know help actually get rid of lines not
just moisturize the lines that I have so
that is something that I'm wanting to
get into and something that was tempting
me is that right now Sephora is doing
like two times their points on skincare
but I was like okay what's 50 points
instead of 25 like I don't know that
almost tempted me like oh well I want to
get it while it has the point but
there's no reason for that so I've been
staying true I'm trying guys and then
another thing before we left for
holidays so before Christmas
sigmund actually reached out to me which
was like such a weird full-circle moment
for me I remember asking for the Sigma
brush set which is like a lot of the
brushes that I use how long ago was that
that was like so long ago before I had
my channel we're still living in Arizona
and I asked for them from Sam for
Christmas and he got me like a 12 set of
the brushes and you guys know I used my
e-40 all the time so for them to reach
out was like a really cool just a moment
you know of like oh wow that's really
weird that they are actually like
wanting to send me some stuff so they're
gonna be sending me stuff it should be
coming in soon I'm not gonna show any of
it I'm like really until after the month
because I don't consider it breaking my
noba because I got it before I just
couldn't have them send out the package
until after I got back from holiday cuz
it would have just been sitting on my
porch but that's really exciting and
such a cool moment for me and so I'm
excited to see what they sent I don't
know what it'll be feel like I'm using a
lot of laura geller products but i
really do like them this is actually an
eyeshadow trio but I really love using
the two like lighter eyeshadows as my
highlighter I think that they just look
so pretty on the skin I really like a
more sheer highlight like I want it to
be glowy but I don't want it to be too
opaque and powdery so that's why these
that's why these shadows really work for
me and I feel like I consistently prefer
something that is supposed to be an eye
shadow as a highlight on my skin I'm
gonna go in with brows I'm gonna keep
this part in and just speed it up so you
guys can see it I'm gonna be using let
me show you an order I'm gonna be using
the colour-pop brow boss pencil and
blonde for the first half of my brows
I'm then gonna use the elf brow pencil
and taupe for the last half of my brows
and then I'm going to set them with this
elf beautifully bare like sheer tint and
clear so that's how I do my brows
basically every single day I mean
basically it is every single day that's
how I do them so yeah
I hope you guys enjoy hopefully I stay
in focus and in frame
all right so brows are done there's even
as they're gonna get
I don't know it's always weird doing my
brows out here and plus my brows are
just like every day is a different day
so I'm actually gonna assume you guys in
I think for this next portion I know a
lot of you guys are asking for like a
closer up so I'm gonna zoom in for the
tutorial or like the eye portion of this
so yeah hopefully it actually looks good
and you guys can see how not actual
perfect my eye shadow actually all right
hi guys so today I wanted to use a
couple of different things first I
probably should prime my eyes I'm gonna
use my ELF primer I do like this but I
do find that it doesn't last like all
day like if I'm actually having a
12-hour day it can end up creasing so I
just thought I would update you guys on
that and I'm just gonna set that in
place with my laura geller powder just
so that way nothing's like weirdly
sticky or anything like that I'm just
gonna go for something kind of neutral
stuff using this elf duo and I'm gonna
be using the matte shade with this Brown
my voice Oasis so cracking and I'm just
going to be putting that into the crease
I'm doing something a little bit more
cool toned I feel like then maybe normal
but it's still very neutral so I'm just
running that through the crease with my
big fluffy brush and I'm not being too
precise I'm usually never precise like
when it comes to my eye looks in my
aesthetic I personally enjoy something a
little bit more blown out a little bit
more blended and not necessarily like a
cut crease or something as harsh it's
not that I don't appreciate that it's
just not what I love the most you know
what I mean and then this is the eye
that always gives me problems like it
doesn't matter what I do it always just
looks a little messed up I think that
looks nice for a crease next I'm going
in with these because I'm doing a rehaul
and I'm using these in it so I thought I
would just I don't know use them today
as well I'm going on with the shade
snake eyes from colour-pop and I'm going
to be just pressing that onto my lid
with my finger I prefer this this is my
favorite method of a
I shadow on myself when it comes to like
shimmery LED shades and then this look
is gonna be pretty shimmery because the
next shade we're going in with also is
kind of shimmery too so we're gonna see
if we can make it look more matte though
so I'm gonna go in with this one here
this is the colored Dragonfly and this
is where we're gonna get a lot of that
cool toned color in and so I'm just
going to be fitting that into the outer
corner to give some depth and whatnot so
I like to work in just like little like
tiny circular motions I guess and just
kind of smudge it in there and I really
like to tap my brush off because this is
where I find I can get a lot of fallout
not just with this shade but just in
general with a lot of shadows if I don't
really tap the brush off and then as I
have less product on my brush I will use
it to kind of like feather out the look
and then I like to look straight on in
my mirror and try to just have my eyes
open and see where things aren't even
and try to fix that alright cool I'm
just gonna take the e-40 that we had
with the transition shade and just kind
of buff around the edges with no extra
product going into the lower lash line
I'm gonna take the shade Dragonfly again
that darker shade and I'm just going to
lightly buff this again keeping most of
the intensity on the outer corner that's
what I like to do just to keep my eye
bigger and that will be the defining
shade now if you wanted to you could
always go in with like a black or
something and really you know define
this but I don't want to go too dark not
today so when it comes for the inner
corner highlight I'm just gonna go in
with the shadows again that I already
have
this is Nell in Zen from colour-pop and
I'm going to be placing that on the
inner corner and this has like a gold
reflex to it it's kind of weird
everything so cool
and then there's this one and Teegarden
in there a little bit more I guess warm
you could say and I'm gonna bring a
little bit on the inner portion of the
lower lashline I feel like I have quite
a bit of fallout so I'm gonna go in with
some loose powder and the brush I used
to set my under eye and I'm just gonna
kind of like load it up and then go over
those areas to try to like sweep it away
without impressing it into my skin I'm
gonna finish out the look like I would
so that you guys can see what it looks
like when it's just in neutral and then
I'll go in with the pink so I'm going to
put some white in my waterline and this
one is not my favorite from went wild so
I don't really suggest it I'm gonna do a
whole video because I'm gonna try to
find the best white for the waterline
that one's not it and then I'm just
gonna take a brown you can use any Brown
that you have and tightline someone was
asking me like how do you tight line so
for me this prepare because I'm gonna
look like a demon I take my eyelid and
hold it up and then I just place the
product at the base of the lashes I do
this on my clients as well and yeah it's
like always a precarious situation but I
like to keep it again mostly on the
outer portion of my lashes I don't like
to bring it too far in I find that it
transfers throughout the day a lot of
the times and goes to my inner corner it
doesn't matter what eyeliner I really
use plus I'm trying to again keep the
eyes wide and open and keeping the
darkness on the outer part of the eyes
is going to keep them looking like not
farther apart but just wider that's what
I forgot I knew I would forget something
so I don't have a mascara with me so let
me go grab that and then we'll move on
to the pink so I already put my mascara
on I figured you guys see me
I'm also using a little wife right now
so I just have the Tarte lights camera
lashes on what's going on there and I
didn't realize it but I had like kind of
a little crusty on my inner corner so
I'm really sorry you guys had to sit
through that one Oh hopefully I don't
have any more I'm going to just reapply
the inner corner highlight that we used
I'm also gonna pull back my little hairs
now that Foundation's done and just
become myself hmm something I noticed
when I was putting on my mascara is
there is a lot of fallout so if you're
gonna use that snake eye shade be
careful I don't remember having it so
much Paulo the last time I use just but
yeah it's kind of glittery everywhere
also I don't necessarily suggest you
going in and like blending over it
because then it puts that sparkle kind
of everywhere so just a little warning I
would finish my eyes there if I wasn't
gonna add the pink so I'm just gonna
finish my lips off I'm gonna be using
another product I'll talk about in a
later video this is the pony land lip
gloss from colour-pop and this is very
similar to tight fit when it comes to
formula because it has a lot of like
glitter in it I'm gonna wipe off the
foundation I just
it gets so gunky if I don't and yeah I
think this like cool toned color will
look really nice I almost wished that I
could leave the kind of like muted out
color that is my lips with the
foundation without it looking gunky cuz
I feel like well this is made my lips
look really intense when they aren't but
hopefully they'll die down from rubbing
them oh yeah you can definitely feel the
glitter in this just so you know so if
you like neutral I would stop here for
my skin tone if you want something with
a little bit more drama maybe add a
little bit of a black or a really dark
brown to the outer corner and some liner
and would definitely darken and stuff I
personally just like to keep it a little
bit lighter for everyday like
I'm gonna wear dark liners and like that
that's more like an extra thing for me
but now let's go into the pink so I'm
gonna be taking this shade here savage
from Urban Decay I like using this brush
here which is a really crappy brush I
got on eBay it's really scratchy and but
something about it just lets me feather
the color in nicely so that's why I like
it and I like to just swirl and kind of
evenly coat the brush I tap off the
extra and then I start here and just
kind of swirl the color where I want it
the most intense and then once that
pigments down I'll blend into the brow
bone and that's it guys it's not you
know too much of a process I like to
have pretty light pressure you can see
I'm holding the brush pretty far back I
just have a delicate hand when it comes
to applying makeup whether it's on
myself or other people like that's
something a lot of people mentioned when
I do their makeup is that I'm like
painting their face that's just how I
like to hold my brushes and I find it
just have more control because you can
have the same brush and use different
amounts of pressure and it's gonna look
different so I like to keep the most
intensity like right here at the front
part of the brow and I just blend it
straight up sometimes I won't do my brow
gel and I'll do this and then I'll do my
brow gel and kind of incorporate the
pink that way too but either way I do it
I do it both ways so last I guess we can
be zoomed in for this I'm gonna be using
my Milani spray and everyone talks about
this spray being like amazing I don't
know if mine's weird but it like sprays
in a like a lime it's like a tall line
it's really weird but I like the smell
of it I don't just like the product I
just was expecting something a little
different I think okay I'm gonna zoom
out show you guys the final look and I
won't be done I really hope you guys
enjoyed this kind of get ready with me
and I don't think this one was too too
chatty but it was kind of fun trying out
a new product and I
hope you guys in joyed kind of a neutral
I I know I took it with the pink but it
just would've been a little boring if I
didn't add something right I think so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so so much for watching
and I will see you in my next video bye
