is going to be a get ready with me I
just look good oh and um i decided that
i would feel myself getting ready talk
about my more recent peru trip it's been
a little bit i know you guys have heard
me talking about it but this is gonna be
me just like telling you about it well
i'm getting ready just to find chitchat
get ready with me type of thing i hope
you guys enjoy let's just like get into
it it's been already a crazy morning
like I literally ran to the bank so i
could do laundry and get quarters and i
wasn't expecting to but they were like
guys blowing stuff and anyway it's
already been a morning so oh yeah let's
go I've already moisturize my face so
I'm just gonna go in and Prime am using
Smashbox the poor one the one that's
good for pores I just have a sample of
it that I stole not stole cuz we were
allowed to take them but took from work
and it's just in this little thing so
I'm just gonna put that in the areas
that I need it so mostly just like my
t-zone and like where how big pores I
don't put it everywhere lately I haven't
been I guess just start off so we went
to Peru the reason we chose who is Sam
was able to put in for work saying that
he wanted to go to Peru and do work
there and so he got he was able to get
that job and so he went to Peru before I
did he was there two weeks before me and
then me and my mom met him and we spent
a week together actually doing vacation
you type of stuff so yeah I was alone
here for two weeks while he was there
and then me and my mom met at LAX
airport because I'm from Arizona so and
I live in California right now we met at
the airport which was really awesome I
got to the airport using an uber but I
broke my phone before we like before he
left I was doing laundry and I fell and
I like hurt my me really bad too and Sam
was in here was like during that two
weeks and so my screen right now is
currently still cracked halfway so I can
use the bottom half of the screen but I
can't use the top half and the uber app
you can't like turn your phone sideways
so I can't like manipulate it to make it
work so Sam ordered me my uber from Peru
to come and pick me up here at my
house and our plane left at midnight on
the 16th so it's been a while but we
left on the sixteenth of October at
midnight so technically the 17th October
and so when my god drop me off there was
so much traffic that day like la isn't
toria's for traffic but like I'm telling
you there was just so much traffic I
left my work out for 30 and I'd still
like I literally came here had the upper
left and I didn't get to the airport
until after eight like it was crazy but
the guy dropped me off at the wrong
terminal and i knew it i knew he dropped
me off at the wrong terminal because i
was like mmm it just says american like
Virgin Airlines or something like I was
like it's American Airlines and he
dropped me off at Terminal 3 and I
needed to be at terminal thing was six
so I had to walk all those terminals to
find my mom which luckily it wasn't too
horrible like it could have been worse
but that was like annoying and
ultimately though I saw my mom and I
like cried I was so nice to see her and
then we just like eight food got on the
plane whatever so we take the plane we
lent in Lima let's move on to the next
step of this lately i've been using the
girl meets pearl it's a liquid pearl for
the face I've just been using it between
my primer and my foundation so I'm just
going to take some of that and like put
on my face I've been liking it i mean i
don't think i would like to purchase it
but I definitely haven't been hating
this step in my routine lately and I use
quite a bit of products oops so we land
in Lima and Sam's there with a guy from
the hotel to drive us and that was
really nice to see him after so long and
we spent the rest of the day in Lima and
we spent the night there so we were
pretty tired but we really didn't take a
nap until later that night but we spent
the day in Lima and then some of the fun
things we did there was a cat park there
it's called jf kennedy or JFK park like
after the president here but it's a park
like kind of in the middle or by the
city center
I don't even know where it is so if I'm
wrong I'm so sorry but there's like all
these cats like when I tell you there's
a lot of cats I mean like it's insane
there's so many cats and that was really
fun and cool I didn't really pet any cuz
I felt a little freaked out but it was
really cool to see all the cats and just
cool if they just like live in this park
and people come and it's just cool to
see a different culture who have like
you know just being outside and doing
stuff outside is just so much bigger
there than at least where I live I mean
la is more like that but um it's just
nice to see people outside enjoying life
and it's late at night but they're still
out and it's like everyone's out it's
not just like you know people who were
drunk clubbing it's like everyone's
having a good time having a coffee
having a juice I don't know just hang it
out the park so we did that and then we
went to sleep that night and then we got
up the next morning I believe is when we
had to take our flight to Cusco so you
can't just fly into cusco you have to
fly into lima it's the only
international airport that have in peru
so we flew into lima and then we flew to
cusco and then from cuzco i think we we
didn't even spend the night there we
then from cusco once we landed which
it's like an hour flight we went to a 88
ombo i believe is kind of how you
pronounce it it's pretty close which is
like in the middle of the sacred valley
so it's kind of halfway between cusco
and machu picchu and that's where we
were staying and so we drove there which
is like an hour and a half drive and it
was super beautiful the sacred valley is
so beautiful just as mountains on either
side of you you're really in touch with
the fact that it's just there's not a
ton of modern conveniences I mean it's
still there's still internet there's
still all these things but it's
definitely more primitive I guess which
was really nice and the little place we
stayed out was right next to yeah this
is going to set up the story for later
the place we were staying at an 0088
ombo so hard to say was right by the
train tracks when I'm telling you which
the train is how you get either from
cusco to that place or from that place
to machu picchu you have to basically go
by train our hotel was like literally
right next to it like I mean you have to
pass by the people who like let people
on the train to get to our hotel I can't
tell you
any closer just know that it was like
hmm right there like crazy right there
I'm really gonna get anything done in
this get ready with me I'm just talking
i'm using my little sample of my
smashbox camera ready BB cream i just
want to use this up it's in one of my
projects all this stuff is basically in
a project i'm just gonna be using that
and i'm an easy beauty blender to blend
it in which I you normally don't do but
I've been liking lately just say so we
arrived at that hotel and we really just
like hang out there they had this super
delicious frozen lemonade welllll I made
because when you order for lemons it's
really alive but it was so good it's
like this frozen limeade with like real
limes in it like mixed up with mint it
was so good I want to try to recreate it
I might like make a video like I'm not
obsessed with it we just hung out you
know got dinner whatever and the next
day we were going to Machu Picchu we
went to Machu Picchu our train left
pretty early and we weren't just going
in to Machu Picchu we also were going to
climb want to why new Picchu which is
like the mountain next to Machu Picchu I
thought that was gonna be not like no
big deal but I didn't like train for it
let's say and it was super difficult it
was kind of a mix of the altitude as
well as you know not necessarily being
in the best shape or whatever not being
prepared for that but I also had so much
anxiety climbing that mountain was so I
was just so anxious I knew about the
altitude is getting to me because I was
just so out of breath and it's basically
like a huge stair stepper you're just
climbing stairs the whole time and some
of them are like treacherous mom got a
little bit frightened by like the height
and stuff it was a journey for us so you
had to like get there by 11 so we were
running through the park to get to our
gate to like climb the mountain by 11
because if you don't get there they
don't let you up and they only let a
certain amount of people up to climb it
so that it's not everyone we thought
okay we made it we have all this time
the park closes at five we can take our
time you know no need to stress and so
it was taking us a long time to get up
there people that started with us for
passing us on the way down it's supposed
to be like an hour hike but seriously
it's like
it's super intense if you ever see
pictures of Machu Picchu there's like
Machu Picchu ruins and those huge
mountain next to it that's enough of a
client it was like pretty intense and it
got to be I think it was almost two and
a guy was like you have to turn around
and we were almost to the top and I
start like crying it's already been like
I've already been so anxious this whole
time had so much anxiety because I just
I don't know and it's so beautiful you
would think like oh but I just had so
much anxiety about being trapped in the
middle of nowhere you just can't leave
like if you wanted to leave and go back
to Lima or whatever it just you couldn't
there you're trapped here there's oh I
don't know I'm a city girl at heart I
guess you know like I I loved my trip
but you know I just had in that moment a
lot of anxiety about a lot of things and
then to this guy to tell me that we
can't finish climbing it I'm like are
you kidding me I did not climb this far
so I start crying and so luckily he was
really nice he's like okay hurry so we
dropped all of our stuff like we just
left it on the side of the mountain and
we like hurried and climbed the rest of
the way and he took a couple pictures of
us and he was really nice after that but
then he stopped us the whole way down
because he's like making sure everyone's
leaving which was even more anxiety for
me because I'm like don't wanna
disappoint this guy so I'm like trying
to go go go moms having issues we sounds
like the most crazy pack of people but
mom's having issues going down the
mountain because of the height and
everything I'm like some of these things
were really treacherous like I'm telling
you almost straight down and like on
jaggedy rocks and like you have to hold
onto like this like iron rope that's in
the wall we weren't prepared and so by
the time we get down I'm like done like
I don't want to see anything else so we
didn't even get to really I would have
rather I guess either had two days or
not necessarily climbing on just to like
learn more about the history and stuff
like that just you guys now i'm using
the Boyne concealer to conceal
everywhere mmm that I don't feel like
the coverage of that was enough I don't
know I guess that's what I'm doing as
much as I love it i'm so glad we went to
Machu Picchu it was just definitely
interesting and I was just very tired
you know we did it definitely a
different way me and Sam do that often
will like oh it's no big deal and will
like plan something and I
realize holy crap were insane and that's
kinda how that turned out but you know
it was an adventure and it's you know in
and of itself I'm really proud of myself
i think climbing that mountain was
seriously one of the hardest things I've
ever done like ever done it was just so
hard but I did it yeah so we get down
from the mountain and we're like done so
we go eat dinner like / lunch which we
had to have any food at this point
either like we had to basically take the
train which took an hour to get there
then take the bus up to the Machu Picchu
then run through hotcha Picchu to get to
the thing by 11 so at this point we
haven't had any food so were like
starving I mean it was like a whole
crazy thing then we take the train back
to our hotel and we're supposed to leave
the next day and we kind of here these
rumors oh you better get out now there's
no way to leave tomorrow and we're like
what the heck but we just didn't really
think anything of it like we're not
going to get into other people's
business we don't know what their whole
situation is and then the next day we
wake up and there's a protest going on
from what i know i got i believe they
the the people were protesting because
they're voting on whether or not to make
like machu picchu private or keep it
like a state-run thing so they were
wanting to keep it state-run not
privatized the train completely stopped
like no one could get on the train there
were no ways to get out of the sacred
valley they put like blocks on the roads
and blocked off bridges you couldn't get
out and I'm not saying it was like scary
as in like violent but you know being
from America we don't do that
necessarily where's that is more common
i guess in south america before things
like this happened to we were we had to
we didn't have a reservation and we had
to get to cusco but we couldn't our
driver tried to come and get us from our
hotel so we thought were gonna get out
were like yay no he couldn't get through
the bridge was completely blocked off
and they were like throwing rocks at him
and stuff because you know they want
everyone to band together and to follow
this so that way they can like you know
get what they need done I get it so we
were stuck in a way to tambo we didn't
have a place to stay luckily like so
last minute we were able to get another
room at our hotel because
much as we couldn't get out people
couldn't get in it was also raining so
if we had to like go somewhere else we'd
have to carry all our luggage in the
rain oh it was so stressful and so
luckily we got a room then we were like
okay we can leave tomorrow cuz it's only
supposed to be two days long but it
lasted the rest of the two days so the
next day our driver can come get it till
it late at night so when we finally are
allowed to get picked up like because
you can make it through there's now so
much traffic and we're leaving out of
Toyota tambo to cusco and there's still
the barricades on the road so half the
time we're driving on the wrong side of
the road and then next to us is a pile
of like rocks up to the size of the car
but they just didn't clear the other
side of the road they only clear at the
one side like constantly were passing
over things like that like at one point
me and Sam had to get out of the car
because there was like a bear cave but
the road wasn't that clean and so he had
to go over it but he had like a lower
car and we were trying to like get
weight out of the car so it wouldn't
like scraped up the bottom of it plus
with all of our luggage and everything
so we like got out of the car like
standing and all these rocks and stuff
like it's good it was kind of crazy like
that's insane and there was like this
huge traffic jam because they were still
boulders in the road so then all these
people had to get together and like move
the boulder out of the road like I still
think like wow that really happened and
it did so yeah it was kind of crazy
definitely not what me and my mom
expected luckily we didn't miss any
planes or anything out of kuzco because
we were planning on doing much Picchu
and then going to Cusco and being in
Cusco for a couple days we ended up only
being able to be in Cusco for one day
because of the fact that we kind of get
to Cusco and it was just crazy and some
people like from our hotel left like at
four in the morning I'm like went
through back roads and like how to like
sneak across stuff too like it out of
the the valley to like then leave on
their plane so they don't miss their
plane it was crazy everyone was missing
planes and then luckily we went to watch
peecee because there were no trains
going to Machu Picchu and watch picha
was closed down for two days and we went
the last day before it closed down for
two days so if we didn't go on that
Wednesday we wouldn't have been able to
to go which would have been so upsetting
i would have been so so so so obsessed
anyway so that was that and
right by the train to they were like
protesters when the first train did
finally come in we were still at our
hotel and they were like protesters
yelling and it wasn't violent luckily
sorry about that it wasn't violent
luckily but I mean it's just kind of
like I feel like tensions are high you
just don't know in the situation's if
they could turn violent if they couldn't
everything's up in the air so it's a
little scary and it's not your home
country you're just there visiting so it
feels kind of like oh my gosh what the
heck and I get that they had to do it if
you have to protest there it must be
something very serious to be protesting
yeah this is the last enough about that
then we went to cuzco we did some fun
things in cusco into some churches the
hotel we stayed in at cusco I don't know
at night it turned into like a dog pound
their stray dogs roaming around cusco
i'm telling you on the way from the
airport to the sacred valley i counted
how many stray dogs had counted I think
60 something dogs and I started like
halfway through because I was like and I
count them as we're driving back and
there were like 60 something stray dogs
it was crazy there's so many of them and
when we stated our hotel at night I
don't know what happened but all they
did was bark all 62 of them like right
below our door it was insane it was so
crazy to hear that many dogs barking I
do not know why that happened whatever
but it did I think my face is pretty
concealed at this point right I've been
patting it for like seven years this is
gonna be such a long video I'm sorry now
i'm going to set my face with my Rimmel
stay matte powder anyway it was just
kind of crazy but we didn't stay in
Cusco that long the room was really nice
the views were really pretty I mean I
don't want to think that i'm bashing the
trip because it was a great trip i just
want to tell you guys like you know the
fun parts i guess and you guys will see
this too in my vlog video that i will at
some point put up so you guys will see
all the views and everything we had a
great time regardless of the protest i
mean it's still a story it's still our
trip it's unique and special to us being
there you know we all loved the trip but
it was just kind of crazy sometimes and
that's just life and that's how things
work you plan you plan and then real
life happens
doesn't always go the way you want so we
did to scale we went back to Lima flew
out of Cusco de Lima which luckily we
were able to do that too because even
after the protest the planes the day
before that we're like not leaving Cusco
to Lima for whatever reason they're like
a safety issue so we were just like so
happy to be back in Lima yay we made it
to Lima we can kind of chill out we made
it to Lima limas like a huge major city
we ate at a place called mangos which is
really nice by the ocean and we ate
there twice because I really liked the
brownie thing they had I don't know we
just went there again the food was so
good everywhere we went I got lomo
saltado like everywhere we went just
because I know I like it and I'm a
really picky eater and if I like
something just I'm someone of habit so
I'll just like get the same thing all
the time that's just how I am so when we
were there got lomo like everywhere and
like raided the lomo compared to other
lamos I've had but it was really great
that's mostly it so we'll keep on the
fish I'm going to kind of bronze in
contour using my too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer I am so close to being
done with this it's so exciting so
that's what we basically did I mean it
was mostly a trip about seeing Machu
Picchu and then obviously we're going to
do other stuff while were there like we
went to casinos in Lima that was fun we
bought a ton of gifts in Peru you guys
are probably seen my Peru Hall if not
i'll link it down below but we bought a
lot of stuff because as I mentioned in
that video it is a lot cheaper to buy
stuff in Peru than it would be to buy it
here so we did take advantage of that so
that was fun just to shop around and
barter with people and stuff Sam like
really picked up the language quite a
bit i mean we're from arizona and we now
live in california and he works with a
lot of people who speak Spanish it
wasn't super hard for him he had called
cameras in Spanish because that's how
what they spoke so it was it was a great
trip it was so nice to see my husband to
after such a long time of not being with
him we don't spend time apart like that
okay so used up all the two-faced one so
I'm going to use the bronzer in here now
this is that Steven Klein denars palette
that I've hauled
recently as well hopefully they match
right who I'm trying to think there's
like anything else that like I really
wouldn't like it touch upon but I mean
Machu Picchu is so beautiful I think
everyone should definitely go it's the
mountains they're so beautiful they just
kind of shoot up from nothing Ben
Arizona I lived in a valley the valley
and the mountains just you're more like
gradual and then their mountain they go
down these ones just go kind of straight
up kind of like what do you see pictures
I think of like Japan and Thailand and
like the boats and stuff and then its
water sea level and then all of a sudden
mountain comes up it's kind of more like
that than a regular Mountain the people
in Peru everyone was so kind everyone
was so kind to us just everyone even
people that weren't like hospitality you
know they were all very kind I'm really
happy we did that to have that memory
okay I'm gonna stop so many is this
blush here from the palette I don't know
what it's called I think it's blasphemy
I hope my makeup looks like halfway
decent because I'm not really using any
mirrors I'm just kind of winging it and
talking to you guys thanks to everyone
for all the really sweet comments on my
last haul video in my hair as you can
tell like I've already dieted again
since then it just fades it fades so
easily and I don't even know why because
I don't even wash my hair all the time
um I think it just like comes out so
when I go back I'm gonna get my mom to
dye it for me more I guess
professionally which hopefully she'll do
because if she did not want me to dye my
hair I'm gonna highlight my face using
this starlix I shadow in Pearl I've been
using this as my highlight and i super
love it I'm really excited for the
holidays I'm talking about other stuff
now because I feel like the trip is like
done I don't want to just talk your ear
off about about it so it means it's time
to also catch up with you but I'm so
excited for the holidays I'm going back
for both thanksgiving and christmas i'm
so happy for that because i didn't think
that was going to be a possibility with
the fact that i worked retail but now
that I don't kind of works out I'm gonna
do my eyebrows but I'm scared to do them
on camera I'm gonna do my eyebrows and
then I'll come back ok so my eyebrows
are done they're purple I've really been
liking purple brows with my purple hair
it's like the norm for me
which it's kind of weird too because I
didn't dive on purple I just use makeup
but they stain because it's usually
purple and pink pigments are quite stay
Nene hmm so yeah they're like our kind
of stained because I do it every day I'm
proud of my legs using the lorac I
shadow primer something fun me and Sam
dude we've had more time to do fun
things because I haven't been in school
or I mean I haven't been working so we
went and did Mickey's you know Halloween
party that was really really fun we did
that like a couple years ago with my mom
and my little brother we did it again
for our anniversary our one-year
anniversary just recently passed so we
like to celebrate things for like ever
so we did that and now i'm just setting
that with a wet and wild cream eyeshadow
not cream Billy cream-colored but it's
kind of thinking it's just been nice to
do stuff I've also had some friends come
into town recently which has been nice
just to see familiar faces but I'm so
excited to see familiar faces back home
we haven't been back home and it'll be
nice to be back home when we don't have
a job like we'll just be able to hang
out with our family the whole time and
friends and whatever so on my lids i'm
using that same star looked i shadow and
i'm just putting this all over the lids
it is so hard to do these when you can't
see anything i'm using this tiny little
mirror like what you didn't think anyone
ever use this but oh my gosh it's stuck
I can't get it back down oh my gosh okay
we'll find out getting powder everywhere
I want to put it in my inner corner 2
i'm doing a really simple look today
I've also been really excited with my
channel you don't ever come on to
youtube and think you're gonna like have
a million subscribers so not that I do
but you know and it's just cool to like
see people actually want to see at least
something from me it's been really
awesome and this has really helped me
too i've been really into my project
painting lately I've just been using so
much up I'm super pumped I have so many
videos ready to plant like ready to film
and like plan for next year and like
beginning of your and stuff i'm using
burlap in my crease and i'm just like
kind of sloppily putting it there I'm
just excited to like continue using up
my collection as much as I I love buying
I'm just I just won't have money for
other things I think that's something
that I'm like realizing I just spend all
my free my like extra money on makeup
and it's like I want it I need clothes
like what the heck Lauren you need
clothing too and you know I just wish
instead of spending the hundred percent
of money that I do on makeup now I could
spend like maybe twenty five percent of
the money I deal on makeup and then
spend fifty percent of it on clothes
