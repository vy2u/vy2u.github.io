it's Lauren this is going to be a get
ready with me video I haven't filmed one
of these in a really long time and I
know there are like a million look so
you guys want me to do tutorials on and
I have been crazy busy plus if you can't
tell I'm also 60 i thought that i would
kind of do a talking video catch you
guys up on some things and then also do
a look you guys have been wanting which
i'm gonna do the one with like the pink
in my brows a lot of you guys really
liked that one and i'm going to do
something similar I don't exactly know
what I used in that video and I really
haven't had time to like go back to it
so we'll just do something similar today
everything will be listed down in the
description box in case I don't mention
what I'm using but I am gonna prime
first this is the hard candy sheer envy
primer and it's the shine free version I
do really like this stuff I think it's
really nice and I just put that all over
so as you guys know from my last couple
of videos I felt like a huge group of
videos together I knew I was going to be
really busy this month but I was even
busier than that than I thought so I
worked on a short film at the beginning
of the month for it was an eight-day
shoot but we only film 26 days we had
two days off in the middle so those are
all like 12 hour days on set at like
different locations there are two
different locations where you're
shooting so it drive time and everything
it was like easily like 14 hour days um
and then the two days I had off I
actually got contacted i did a little a
pilot something for i think NBC i'm not
really sure but yeah so i was doing that
for the two days that i was off and it
was back to the short film then when
that short film wrap too had another
short film for three days and those were
pretty long hours to not as crazy well
one of them was crazy but the other two
weren't is insane and then i had i think
two days off and then i got contacted
you and nat geo wild show for two days
so i did that on wednesday and friday
which friday was yesterday i'm filming
saturday we leave tomorrow for san
francisco and then i'll be out of town
until like the third so yeah my life's
been a little crazy let's move on with
foundation
I've been mixing these two lately this
is the Revlon Colorstay in 150 buff and
this is the better skin foundation and
it is in the color 15 ivory I just do a
pump of each it's pretty yellow though
still I feel like or at least with all
my powders and once everything gets on
but either way it's what I've been using
so I'm just going to mix that and then
I'll Beauty blend it on the face with
all that I've just been really busy and
my intention was to get all those videos
up but I couldn't even get them edited i
filmed way too late on that it has just
just been crazy which I'm not
complaining it's nice to have work but
it's just a lot you know especially to
again because these are like such long
days it's not like a nine to five you
know I'll work like like for the call
times for wednesday and friday we're 450
in the morning and the first night i
didn't get off till seven so it's just
you know it's just tiring and then on
top of that banks sick it's just been
kind of hard I mean luckily it hasn't
been too bad like I haven't had like a
fever anything it's just been a little
like a key and just not doing the best
but no i'll probably get super sick
because i have no no reason to keep
going right that's what your body does
anyway hope you guys have been doing
really well I feel like I haven't even
been able to watch people or participate
in anything even though that's not
really my forte I haven't even had time
to if I've wanted to I hope you are you
know doing well for holiday and that if
you have holiday shopping or anything
you're doing to prepare that that's
going well i think i'm going to try to
film a ton of videos today because me
and sam are leaving like i said tomorrow
to go up to san simeon we're going to
the hearst castle i kind of already
talked about this in a favorites video
but it's actually happening now i can't
believe how time has flown we're doing
the hearst castle for christmas so it'll
be all decked out for christmas i'm so
excited for that that'll be on not
tomorrow night the next night so we're
doing the hearst castle my camera shut
off so i'm restarting this
and then we're going to do san francisco
and i'm so excited for that I'm pretty
good with this so let's move on to
concealer I'm going to be using the bare
minerals bare skin complete coverage
serum concealer i bought this because I
got the Sephora coupon you know the 25
off fifty dollar purchase and although i
can get discounts I cannot get fifty
percent off of anything like no brand
gives me that so I took advantage of
that i bought this and one of those new
smashbox palettes which i'll be doing a
review on in this group of video so you
will see that so I this is something
that I really liked from my work when I
used to work at the beauty store I
worked at this was one of the new
products that came out I was working
there and I really liked suggesting it
to people and so I was like I'm gonna
pick up something useful besides more
eyeshadow and I picked this up I use
concealer so much I was like why not try
to try something new and see if I like
it so far it's okay I feel like for dry
skin and be really nice though anyway um
so San Francisco is going to be so fun i
am going to try to vlog it so we'll see
how that goes I just don't know when I
can put it up if I do vlog it so that's
the struggle man if you do videos you
know how much time it takes to sit there
and edit and upload and I try to link
everything it's just so much work and
not that I don't like it just I'm also
exhausted right now because I'm 60
everything feels like a chore so I have
the concealer all blended in now and I'm
going to go in with my sponge and i'm
going in with this kat von d this is the
locket setting powder and translucent i
got this from Influenster and i really
only is it a couple of times and i
basically just was like I want to try to
use this more so I've been baking with
it and actually enjoying it I'm not like
baking his number one fan but I don't
know I've been doing it and it's been
working out so I'm going to bake under
my eyes and set a crap ton of powder all
over my face I don't know it's been
working out for me and I don't feel like
it makes me look like any more dry or
cakey than I feel like is normal not
that I feel like I have Kiki makeup but
you know what I mean so I've just been
racing it I'm going to do the center of
my face and I'm also going to do like
under my cheekbones basically I just
want to use so much of this batter and
trying something new and I put some on
my chin too okay that's like super messy
but I'm totally fine with that now to
set the rest of my face I'm going to be
using the Maybelline better skin and I
just use a big fluffy brush like this
and i just put it in all the places i
didn't put the kat von d powder around
the perimeter of my face and in the
hollows of my cheeks these are areas i
find i don't get too oily too so it
works out so right now while that's kind
of like sitting and baking I'm going to
put some eyebrows on and i decided i'm
just going to use my elf one today just
because it's so easy and i know it works
and i had it closed just going to fill
these in I can't talk while I fill them
in so I'll just speed this part up and
we'll move on
okay that was pretty fast today I mean
they're not perfect and they never are
but I would totally stop here and I'm
just gonna spoolie them out there are so
many videos I want to film right now but
I'm the type of person that I feel
really passionate about something I want
to like film it uploaded it get it up
right that minute and so it's always
hard for me to like wait the time it
takes when I film a lot of videos at
once but I know if I don't film it now I
won't have that same passion for that
idea in like a week in half when I can
film it and it could go up so juggling
right now it's just been so difficult
I'm gonna bronze now that we have
eyebrows on so I'm going to take the
physicians formula butter bronzer and
I'm going to take this Real Techniques
brush and I just kind of start putting
this in the parameters basically where
the baking isn't and I just kind of buff
that loosely all around I know the
biggest part you guys want to see this I
look so hopefully this isn't taking too
much time at all so if there's any
videos you really want to see for me put
them down below because sometimes it's
nice to look back at these types of
videos or in the comments and be like
okay this is something people would
enjoy because i forget what i say i feel
like i can make a supercut of all the
things like I'm going to do this I'm
going to do that and then I just never
have the time to do it or I forget that
I even said that until i go back to an
old video I still can't believe that
2017 is almost here I feel like it's
been such a crazy year and I feel really
blessed about how this year is gone but
I also feel like I don't know I feel
like kind of scared for 2017 i'm hoping
that i'll just keep you know progressing
in the way that i have but it's kind of
scary yesterday was my last work day of
2016 so that is just like so weird that
i'm able to take off that much time and
go do stuff i don't know let's contour
Allah nominee is the Smashbox contour
kit because you guys know I'm trying to
use it up I'm just going gently i'm
using a different brushes as a duo fiber
one from Real Techniques and I find that
I can just get a lighter application
with duo fiber brushes since they're
less dense and it just hopefully
prevents you from doing that okay so
some of the videos coming up I guess
I'll let you know I'm going to do my top
five pallets for 2016 those are just
going to be all the ones like the top
five that I used all year long that I
just love i highly suggest i'm really
excited for that i'm going to be doing a
color pop hall I just have been enjoying
color pop a lot and I have a lot of
stuff i think i made like three separate
purchases which is psychotic I know I
know let's wipe this away while we talk
so I'm going to do a video on that and
giving you my thoughts and opinions I
have my scooter and video coming to and
that's just about that skin care i got
from octa lee and i'm excited to share
that I've really been enjoying it oh I
want to do like a top 16 products of
2016 and I am going to be doing a
giveaway in that video as well so
definitely stay tuned for that ok so I'm
feeling thoroughly powdered I'm gonna go
in I need to get an eye primer I didn't
bring it out here so give me a second
I'll be right back guys so I'm just
priming right now with the Maybelline
master Prime I don't know what I was
talking about it just was on the phone
too soon we're going to a holiday party
tonight before we leave for tomorrow and
we're gonna make cookies to bring so we
didn't know what cookies to make because
they're out of kisses at the store so it
was a dilemma anyway I'm really excited
to film those and get them up though I
hope that they won't be too behind but
just please forgive me that these are
all pre-recorded it's just how my life
has to be right now because I just
cannot wait to be on vacation and just
hanging out and nothing crazy it's going
to be so fun so I'm going to take just a
regular brush all my brushes are dirty
so sorry I'm going to take the cream
color from this palette it's matt and
this is the Smashbox ablaze palette i
believe and i'm just going to set that
all over the eye this isn't as
as I would like for this but I'm just
going with it I'm just not bringing it
on to the brow bone now I'm going to go
in with my e-40 brush and the color
Kennedy from colour-pop this is a matte
like orange color I'm just going to buff
this into the crease I didn't have this
so i know this is a hundred percent a
part of the last look but I've basically
been doing a version of this or colored
browse i've been using pink a lot lately
because obviously my hair is more pink
than normal i feel like usually have
that pastel thing going on and lately
I've just been going full-blown like
pink party on my head I just have been
liking it I just feel so myself with
pink hair I mean I think blondes really
pretty but there's something about pink
that's just fun I love it I think I'm
gonna go for kind of a bright-eyed
effect today so I'm going to take a
color from makeup geek this is the color
starry-eyed I'm just gonna use my finger
and I'm going to press that onto the lid
and I think this look would be fun like
instead of pink you could do whatever
color your hair is if you have colored
air I think that'd be really fun but I
obviously just love pink I was kind of
inspired by Princess Leia to like you
know they have the dots underneath you
kind of try to do like the dot above the
eye but on the brow I don't know that
looks good to me so now I'm going to go
in and blend a darker color in my crease
I'm going to take this matchbox palette
and I'm going to go in with this like
dark rusty color right here this is also
matt and i'm just going to be putting
this on the outer corner i'm blending it
into the crease and just kind of
deepening up the look but still keeping
it really more
I kind of think that's as deep as I want
to go with this look so I'm going to go
in with my Urban Decay electric palette
and I'm going to take the color savage
and this brush here obviously it's dirty
but I really like the way this brush
just kind of like can place the product
and buff at the same time so I'm going
to dip it in tap it off and I'm placing
it like right I don't know like for my I
there's kind of like this dent there and
that's where I like put most of my
product and then I kind of blend out
from there I've been trying to do kind
of more of like a circle then to blend
out like I don't know I'm trying to
contain it a little bit more than in the
past um but yeah that's all I do I don't
know and I like it pretty intense so but
right right there's where kind of my
bone starts like my brush just fits so
nicely there and I just like to make
sure it blends out nicely like into what
my brow color or brow bone color would
be but it can kind of start more harshly
I especially look kind of like Princess
Leia but in pink because of my hair
today too yeah so that's the pink I
really like that I think it looks really
good it just makes me happy I feel like
I'm missing something when I don't have
this in just to finish off the brow say
I'm going to go through with my clear
brow gel and just set them so they don't
move around you could also deepen them
up a little if you wanted to like the
tails or something but i kind of am fine
with it now i'm going to go in with a
liner i've been using this bronze liner
a lot it just gives me a little more
depth than my 1999 liner from urban
decay so i'm going to put this tight
line and then put a little under the
lash line for the lower lash line now
i'm going to go into that smashbox
palette en and i'm going to take the
color we use to dupe enough the outer
corner and just run that under my lash
line and kind of have it the most dense
toward the lash line and kind of blend
out i'm not going to add any pink to the
lower lash line which is something I
like to do just because there's
something about having just that one pop
of pink I've really been enjoying it
doesn't make it almost makes it more
like funky and um not as cohesive but I
kind of been
gmat look I don't want it to look like
like I tried really hard to make a look
I wanted to look kind of like whoa she
just put pink on the middle of her I you
know and then for the inner corner I'm
gonna go in with I think that same color
that's on the lid and just kind of bring
it into the inner corner add some light
and reflectiveness there I'm also going
to go in and put some weight on my
waterline just to kind of brighten up my
eyes and then last I'm going to put some
ol last for the eyes I want to put some
mascara on this is the real Estelle
vol.1 it's the 1 i've been using you
really like it I realized I haven't put
any blush on so I'm gonna do that now I
was like gosh I feel like I look so pale
and that's part of the reason I'm gonna
go in with the rocket or blush from
benefit I've really been liking this
lush then might go to I've just been
using it like every day and I want to
highlight but I really not have a
highlight brush so I'm just going to use
my blush brush today I guess hopefully
that looks okay and last we're gonna do
lips I'm just using an old standby
favorite this is the buxom dolly and you
could do whatever lip color you want
though I feel like I'm so bad at putting
lip colors with it like honestly most
days I would leave the house with my
lips I pens I know it's horrible I
should probably even just watch the
foundation off I don't ok guys and
that's this look I hope this helped you
if you were wanting to recreate this or
just kind of know the technique I use
obviously you could switch up the colors
if you don't have exactly what i use and
do similar colors or try out different
colors that can find be really fun too
it's super simple and something I love
about it the most is the fact that it's
like a neutral I everything about it
besides the pink would be totally
neutral totally wearable and then you
just boom add the pink you know so um ok
that's everything I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day I'm going to film
a million more videos and these probably
won't get to you till like the beginning
of the year hello um but anyway I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day
thank you so much for all of your love
support I appreciate it more than you
know and i will see you in my next video
