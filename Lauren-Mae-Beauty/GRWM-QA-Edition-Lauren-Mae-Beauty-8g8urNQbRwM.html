Lauren this is going to be a kind of
everything video so I'm going to be
doing kind of a chitchat get ready with
me answering some of the questions you
guys asked in my 5000 subscriber video
so it's kind of like my Q&amp;amp;A I'm also
going to be showing you how I do kind of
like my foundation routine using powder
foundation that will be in here and then
I'm also gonna be showing you my
basically everyday makeup look it's been
my everyday makeup look probably for the
past month or so it's just been easy
I've really been enjoying it and this is
the makeup I was wearing in my Instagram
post with my henna tattoo if you don't
follow me on instagram definitely check
me out when I'm not posting here I'm
trying to post more often on there when
I'm on set and doing different things so
that's gonna be this look here someone
requested it so I hope you guys enjoy
let's just get into it it's gonna be
kind of a long rambling video and if you
haven't seen me with no makeup on for a
while Here I am in all my glory so
starting off I have a bare face I did
put a serum on but not a moisturizer
I've just been using a serum lately and
I've really been liking it the first
thing I'm gonna go in with is the Becca
ever matte poreless priming Perfector
this is something that I want to get
through for the end of the year Maggie
from Korea sparkles talked about this
all the time and really likes it and I'm
so jealous because I want to like it so
that's kind of what made me get back
into using this and I do feel like it's
been holding my makeup on I don't think
I love it still but I want to I want to
love it so anyway I'm gonna just use a
little bit of this and put this all over
my face I might try to get through the
priming process before I start answering
questions because it's gonna be it's
kind of a lot of stuff but doesn't take
that much time and I like to work fast
with this primer because I find that if
I don't it can kind of just get stuck
and doesn't blend well so I like to work
with it when it's still nice and wet and
hasn't set yet now on to my second
primer I'm gonna using this Smashbox
pore minimizing primer you guys know
I've used this for a while now and I do
like this but I don't feel like it works
as well as it used to on me I don't know
if my skin's gotten used to it if that's
even like a thing or what so I think
after I finish this one up I'm gonna
move on to something else and I just put
this in the areas that I have the
most texture and pores so that it can
kind of smooth over those areas mostly
around my nose and my cheeks here I have
really big pores right here and then
purely for the sake of this video I'm
gonna be using the benefit what's up
highlighter this isn't my finish 13 but
Halloween you guys know that so I'm just
like using this as a way to force myself
to use it it's working I'm using it and
I'm kind of going happy with this
because I just want to use it honestly
if I'm being completely honest and you
guys know it's broken at the base so
it's just an irritating product overall
for me that seems like a sufficient
amount of glow from this so I'm just
gonna Pat that in with my fingers I find
that fingers are the best way I don't
really like the Beautyblender or
anything with this one so what I like to
do with my powder foundation is I do
like to put down a base usually
sometimes I'll just go in if I want
something really light but just to have
a more perfected look I'm gonna go in
with these you a matte moisture tinted
sunscreen this is in the shade linen and
I try to just use like a little like a
dab of it so that I can just blend it in
with a Beauty Blender on my skin and it
just gives me again still a better base
for my powder foundation and I'm just
gonna go in with the Beauty Blender and
put that all over my face sorry I'm like
doing a million things so I wrote down
questions and video ideas that you guys
have left in the comments of my 5000
subscriber video I just wanted to say
thank you so much for all of your
congratulations and support and love in
that video is very sweet I know I
haven't got back into answering what's
new for me I'm so sorry but I do read
everything that comes through and I do
really appreciate it and all the people
who commented who are like I don't
really comment I feel you we are sisters
so anyway I wrote down some questions
from that video and just like in the
last couple videos that I've got so I
thought that that would be a few things
to go over so we'll start with Sarah
Sarah left a lot of comments I'm gonna
leave her channel link down below she
has one definitely go check her out
she's super sweet her voice is like the
most soothing voice on her channel will
be linked down below but she asked like
4 questions so let's get into those the
first question is what's the hardest
thing you've ever panned I was thinking
about this and I
I don't know quite what the hardest
thing I've ever panned is but I think
the thing I dislike irritating me so
much and I just like it was just like am
I ever gonna get through this was that
tart cream blush stick I just don't use
cream blush I just hated using that it
just took so long I think I had it in
like two or three projects it took a
really long time to get through so right
now off the top of my head that's the
one I would pick I just I couldn't do it
I did it I finished it but you know I
just complained the whole time I'm
actually gonna put a little bit more
foundation on just because it only
really did half my face but if you can
see this is one half and this is the
other half I definitely think it already
looks so much better but it still looks
like skin it doesn't look like
completely perfect
next question she asked was when did you
start wearing makeup and I was someone
who I wore a lot of makeup in grade
school in the sense that it was like
black eyeliner for days and it's just
disgusting when I look back but anyway I
vividly remember my friends wore makeup
and I didn't wear any makeup and they
were like oh you should put eyeliner on
and I was so scared to put it on my
waterline cuz that's where everyone
wears it when you're like 12 you're like
you only put it on the bottom waterline
you don't even know you're top eyelid
exists at that point so they held one of
them held my eye hide down and then
another one like put it in there and I
remember just being like wow this is
like a big step for me and I remember -
I would put like mascara on for school
and I felt like it made me look so girly
I kind of was a little bit of a tomboy
and I think that was like six and
seventh grade I want to say but I never
really had a lot of makeup until I
started watching YouTube it wasn't like
I always loved makeup I mean I felt like
I was pretty good at my makeup although
I didn't wear eyebrows until like after
into college which is scary
I remember six or seventh grades and I
started wearing makeup next question who
are some of your favorite youtubers to
watch now I want to do a whole video on
my favorite youtubers so I'm really
gonna mention a couple here these are
just ones that come off the top of my
head
really like Casey Neistat I don't know
if you guys watch him he does like the
daily vlogs and stuff I go back and
forth but me and my mom watch him and
even like Sam will watch like in the
mornings before I get out of bed
sometimes if I'm not already out of bed
we'll watch them together and I just I
really like him I just line up all a lot
on his views and his work ethic and just
things like that so I just enjoy seeing
someone who shares those views and who's
being successful I think that's so great
if you don't know who this is
I'll leave a link down below he's like
four million subscribers I remember
subscribing to him when he had like
three hundred thousand on his home page
and he was just doing like his actual
like movies you know like with him and
Owen or different things like that and
that's when I just really liked him I
mean I still really like him but I
remember those and now he does the daily
vlogs and he was doing for a while like
snapchat stories I subscribe to that and
yeah anyway really like Casey and I side
I'll stop just like beauty letting my
face for no reason I move on to the next
step before keep going now this is the
point when I'd go in with concealer I'm
gonna go in with the Kat Von D lock-it
cream concealer I got this sent to me
from Influenster if you guys aren't
signed up for Influenster definitely do
they send through a lot of awesome
products I feel like they're getting
more popularity than ever before too so
I feel like the brand's are sending out
or just even better this box was like
extremely awesome and if you guys follow
me on Instagram again you already know
but this is the color warm light three
warm and it's so light I'm like this is
the shade light this is usually the
shade fair for everyone else so I really
like this I've been using it in my kit
though so I'm just going to take a
little bit of this out and put it on my
hand and go from my hand but a different
part of my hand don't know where my
Beauty Blender was and I've been using
this on clients and I just I really have
been enjoying it so I'm just gonna go in
with my Beauty Blender and put it where
I want it
I haven't everyone use this once on
myself if I only had it a couple of days
but I mean this is the light one and I
got one even lighter than this it
literally looks like white it's crazy
and I'm gonna take any excess just on
the high points of my face and then
start blending that out this is a really
thick cream concealer but I still think
it has a really nice look on the skin
even though it seems like it might be
heavy
okay anyway onto
you youtubers that I like I don't even
know I feel like I like seriously the
last month and a half I have not been
watching videos as regularly as I
normally do because I just haven't had
time because I've heard me talk about a
Heather affirm love Heather at so much
but I really do enjoy her videos she has
been doing YouTube for so long like 3
plus years and I just feel like I don't
understand why she doesn't have more
subscribers and she does she's super
thorough and she does reviews and
tutorials and I really like where her
thoughts on halter hit it or quit it or
like the ones where she goes back and
she like looks at past halls she's done
and past favourites videos and stuff I
really like those ones I just think
she's super I really just like her as a
person
and I just think we'd be friends so yeah
I really like Heather's channel I'll
leave her link down below you guys
probably have heard me talk about her so
many times I've mentioned Maggie or
curious sparkles I feel like in my last
couple of videos but I remember watching
her before I had a channel I always have
really liked her and again think we
should be friends she's one of the first
like Project panners that I really like
like to watch every video and really
just loved her and I remember
subscribing her when she had like maybe
like 600 subscribers
she mentioned me and like actually like
two of her videos recently and I was
like trying not to fangirl for those
like what
that's so weird it's just weird that she
even knows who I am
but I really like her channel and I just
I don't know I just I really like her as
a person too so she's someone I watched
like every video or try to watch every
video of I just think she's really good
and I just like her approach to makeup -
like she's not afraid to just be like I
don't want to do this or you know she's
cruelty-free and I feel like she was one
of the first project panners I don't
know everyone obviously but I just feel
like to go cruelty free and I'm not
cruelty free but I totally commend
people who want to take that on and do
that I think that's great
so anyway I'll stop there cuz obviously
I still want to do a video on that so
don't be surprised if you hear them all
again okay last question that sarah has
was if you could only use one makeup
item for the rest of your life what
would you choose she
examples of like eyeliner eyeshadow
whatever and I would choose eyeshadow
let me move on to my next step though
and I'll explain why that's it um that's
all I do sometimes I'll conceal this
even more this little like pimple which
it's so irritating this pimple because
it's been on my face for like three
weeks and it was never something I could
like really pop or anything it's just
taking forever to heal I'm a picker and
so that doesn't help I know but it's
just so irritating so I'm not gonna
conceal it anymore though it's there and
I'm not ashamed of my face so this is
the Ben Nye fair translucent powder and
I'm just going to use this to set under
my eyes with my Beauty Blender I guess
it's kind of like baking I don't really
know I just use it because I don't like
using the powder foundation under my
eyes I feel like it's just too I can't
rush it off but what I'm trying to say
is that it darkens up my under-eye more
than I want it to so I'm just gonna use
this powder to keep that area more light
and this is more of like a thin
consistency so I just feel like it keeps
the eyes not as wrinkly looking and I
take anything extra and put it where I
put the rest of that concealer the
reason I would choose eyeshadow is
because it's a powder and you can use
powders in so many ways so you're gonna
have a powder
obviously as eyeshadow you could use it
as liner I can use it in my brows I can
use it to do blush or highlight or
contour I could use it if I had a shade
in my like skintone as like a powder
foundation type of thing and even for
mascara I feel like if you mixed like a
mixing medium with it and turn that
powder into a liquid you could use it as
a mascara so I just feel like in general
powders or super versatile creams are
too but I just an oily so just creams to
me are like not what I'm about really
but I thought that was a good question
I'm gonna go in with my 4 in 1 pressed
powder foundation from pure you guys
know I love this I've already hit pan on
this I'm like oh gosh I'm already
running out
although the sides are like super full
it's just I kind of dug down I guess and
I used the brush that comes with it this
is like a scratchy brush but I just find
I like it the best out of everything I
have so I just start on my cheek here
and swirl and swirl that's all I do and
I like to really swirl it down on my
neck just to make sure okay let's move
on
in questions it's a lot I'm trying to do
a lot fair whoo next question was from
not yet another alias and she asked me
along with like a huge little comment
because I've been bad at answering or
telling you guys what I'm wearing in the
description box I'm sorry but it just
takes up some time and I already feel
horrible that I'm not uploading nearly
as consistently as I used to but I did
fill it out recently so I'm trying I'm
really trying guys
and then her question was your favorite
makeup look on anyone ever and this is
kind of a hard answer for me to come up
with because I watch as I'm working on
set and doing stuff those looks aren't
like my favorite looks you know I mean
I'm doing just like regular beauty
makeup so I think my favorite I kind of
have two favorites but there are things
that I did with my school so one was a
final I did for my school I can get
posted on my Instagram but it's like the
look I came up with it it was for my
high fashion class final and it's really
simple but like more iridescent and I
made a whole like wood headpiece for it
and I really liked that one and my model
was Erin it was just it was just good I
really just felt confident in that look
that was half way through school when
that final happened so I just really
liked that look and that's just
definitely my style I feel like and then
the other look probably my favorite one
no even over that one would be the look
I did for IMAX this year with my school
I did a demo at my school's booth to
show off our school and I did like a
goth baby doll type of look and I really
just liked it I came up with the concept
myself and picked out and styled it all
and again my model is Erin Erin so it's
my model but I really like that look I
thought it turned out really awesome I
felt really proud of it I was proud of
myself for doing a demo and it was like
nerve-wracking but it was really awesome
and I'll leave it again it's on my
Instagram and the thing that was so
exciting was to IMATS like reposted that
picture of my model like on their
Instagram that felt really awesome I'll
leave links down below if they're on my
Instagram like specifically to those
pictures if you want to see them I don't
know if I'll ever recreate them just
because they're kind of like editorial
and if I'm gonna spend the energy I kind
of want to just come up with something
new I like those ones so the powder
foundation is on it might seem like a
little powdery
now or like I don't know I guess it just
looks like one tone I'm gonna go in with
bronzer now and what I've been using
lately is this palette this is a palette
I created myself of like either depotted
stuff or things I bought and just pan
form but this right here is benefits
hoola bronzer I have hit pan on this too
I feel kind of guilty though because
amber had such a hard time finishing up
that hoola bronzer and I feel like this
one's just going so fast I must just be
really heavy-handed with the bronzer I'm
not really sure how I'm going through it
so fast but yeah I feel a little guilty
about I feel like her her hoola hung on
for like like dear life but anyway I'm
gonna go in with this Real Techniques
just like I think it's their blush brush
but yeah I just like swirl it all in
there tap off the extra and then just do
like a just a very easy kind of contour
but really just like warming up the face
bronzing up the face and going in the
hollows of the cheeks but loosely and
not super like chisel anyway what's the
answer the next question these are all
from a Heather from love Heather and you
all know she's asked me a couple
questions about cosmetology school and
my experience so I actually didn't go to
cosmetology school my school is just a
makeup school and I went to high school
a professional makeup it's in Hollywood
it was on Hollywood and Highland now
it's on Hollywood and Sun no no it's on
Highland and Sunset and I didn't do a
lot of research honestly I just was
looking up schools and I signed up to
get a tour and then I basically just
decided to go there they claim to be the
oldest makeup school in history I'm not
saying I don't believe that by saying
they claim it I'm just saying I don't
know that's like a big thing of theirs
and really the thing that I really liked
about the school was the fact that it
was a year-long program that you were
learning a bunch of different aspects of
makeup and not just learning like it
makeup trends now or just prosthetics or
just special effects or I don't know
just model makeup and not HD use all
that so that was like my number one
thing I already had gone to school like
a lot of the girls going into this
school it's an accredited school so you
can get financial aid to go there from
the government and a lot of people can
come from high school straight out of
high school and go there and not have to
pay because if they get scholarships or
grants or anything like that whereas
I've already gone to college I have two
degrees
so I felt like I kind of knew what I
wanted and if I was gonna pay the money
to go somewhere I really wanted it to be
something that I wanted so those are
like the reasons I liked it the reasons
I chose to go to makeup school just
because I felt like I maybe wanted to be
a makeup artist I mean again I told you
guys my ultimate goal is to have my own
cosmetics line because I am just like a
businesswoman at heart I feel like I
enjoy managing I enjoy running and being
organized in that way and I just I love
products I just feel like that's just
totally me and that's just something
I've always wanted for like oh it's just
a long time now but I just thought that
I could maybe do makeup artistry too and
I'm the type of person that if I'm gonna
charge someone for a service I want to
know about that service I'm not just
trying to like fake it till I make it
that's I'm just too honest for that crap
I'm not a faker man I mean the person we
literally okay I used to carry a little
knife on me and we were in San Francisco
and there was like a sign that said you
know you can't bring any weapons on so
this is me instead of just like hiding
it because I'm scared this is I was here
that's gonna be like a tomato detector
they're gonna find it and think I'm like
trying to sneak on I like a weapon and
it's gonna become this whole thing so
instead of just like playing it cool and
just like waiting to see how it happens
I go to the security guard this woman
and then like hey I have a knife on me
my husband is just like Lauren what the
heck why would you tell someone you have
a knife on you when you're not supposed
to have a knife on you and I was like
well I just wanted to let them know when
she's like I'm gonna pretend I didn't
hear that
and I was like okay and got back in line
but that story I feel like sums up so
much about me and just like I'm honest
to a fault a lot of the time it's just
because I don't want to ever be thought
of as not honest but anyway where was I
going with this story oh yeah so I
wanted to go to makeup school for like a
whole year and just get a good education
if I was gonna charge people and so
that's why I wanted to go to school
I thought early on you guys can go back
to my videos I mean I've been doing
videos so long now not so long like a
year and a half but since I moved here
I've been videotaping stuff and so for a
while I thought I didn't want to do
makeup artistry even though because I
just felt really nervous doing people's
faces and stuff and
now I'm like working gigs so that's
changed but yeah anyway I'm just gonna
like end that question there cuz it's
just a lot and we have more to get to
and if you want more in depth on that I
can do like a whole video I want to
borrow you bronzers on I just kind of
bronzed everywhere I don't know
now I'm gonna take like an angled
contour brush and I've been really
liking like these peachy colors but I've
noticed this palette is quite old except
for these blushes aren't as old but it's
just like everything just has like
barely any pigmentation and they're so
powdery so I feel like I'm gonna like
have to give up this palette soon or
just like throw away a lot of these
products cuz I mean do you see all that
powder there's so much powder just from
putting my brush in there and I just
don't feel like it translates onto the
cheeks very well but I still use it
every day anyway so I'm just sweeping
like a mix of everything on my cheeks
and I do like to go a little heavy I
mean not too heavy but just add some
color to the face and then I am gonna go
in and highlight this is the Sephora
Pantone universe again this is in my
finished 13 by Halloween and I'm gonna
be using this highlighter here the other
question that Heather had asked was oh
shoot I didn't really talk about my
experience at school I guess I'll go
into that but then she also asked about
my experience on set I'm sorry this look
looks probably really crazy so my
experience at school was a positive one
I was working full-time for a good six
months of school which was hard and I
don't know how I was still half loading
videos and all of that that was like a
crazy time of my life so I really feel
like with my school it's what you put
into it's what you get out of it I
worked really hard and all the teachers
could see that I worked hard like I said
a lot of people come out of high school
or just don't take it as seriously as I
feel like they should because we're
paying I painted $17,000 to go to school
that is a lot of money I had to pay for
that out of pocket like I didn't get any
scholarships or grants or any of that
stuff to go there and so it was a big
decision financially for us to make that
a part of our lives and so when I was at
school I was there at school I was ready
to learn if we had a project we had like
for theater and high fashion we had
different projects every single class
and so I would come prepared and bring
like props and different things because
I'm trying to like not win but like get
the best out of it that I could
so I definitely feel like with that
school specifically and I'm pretty sure
any makeup school you're gonna go to you
need to put into it what you're gonna
what you want to get out of it and I
think that I proved that to my fellow
classmates and also my teachers and I
mean at the end of it I got both the
awards of like not only the best student
but the best makeup artist that think
about like thinking about like a little
cute award I mean I'm super grateful and
super happy about that and I don't know
I also feel like man like it felt really
good because I felt like I worked really
hard and I almost feel like I did
deserve it so it's like it feels really
awesome to just get that feedback back
in that forum that was my experience I
mean I can do a whole video on that
because there's a lot that goes into it
and like the different classes and all
that stuff but now with my experience
with working gigs and stuff and this
kind of ties into another question
someone else had which was about just
like she wants me to do like a whole
video on it like establishing myself as
a makeup artist but I almost feel like I
can't really talk about that because
it's like literally I I was doing some
things on my own but the last two months
have like skyrocketed and I just don't
feel like I can be like I'm an emeritus
now like let me tell you how to do it
how to be successful like I am because
it's like one I'm still pinching myself
to I mean this isn't even like the best
most pinnacle of success that I feel
like you could be as a makeup artist
although I will say I feel extremely
blessed I mean I don't even again I'm
still pinching myself how I'm here and
working on the sets that I'm working on
being so green in the industry I mean I
know a lot about makeup and I know a lot
about you know I had school and did that
but I mean it's still kind of crazy
let's move on to the next step first
let's do brows I'm gonna brush through
my brows with a spoolie and then I'm
gonna go in with first my ebay little
brow pencil I've been using this a lot
and fill in the front portion and I'm
gonna use a second pencil from
Maybelline to fill in the outer portion
but anyway let's keep talking about my
experience on set so right now set wise
when I'm talking about side I'm mostly
in studios like Sound Studios because I
do a lot of work for interviews like for
TV shows like reality show when you know
they're doing their reality thing then
they cut to an interview of them talking
about that experience
and that's what I've been doing a lot of
makeup for I personally like being on
set like this like a movie or like that
as opposed to doing like private clients
only because I don't know I just like
getting paid from production more than
getting paid from a personal person and
although I feel like you can do more
clients like you can't charge as much
necessarily for one makeup client but if
you're not on set as long like the last
couple of days I was working 12-hour
days like I got their call time was 7:30
and I didn't start driving home till
8:15 liked a lot of time not that I'm
complaining I'm just saying like there's
a difference between those two but I
really like being on set and meeting
everyone and I feel like way less
nervous than I used to and again I can
make a whole video about this I can't
really say two things I'm working on
they're not really like released yet so
I can't really talk about them I don't
think and I don't want to like risk it
by talking about it it's like not worth
it those two things didn't like every
gig I've got I give all my credit a
hundred percent to Michelle my manager I
will leave her Instagram link down below
if you want to follow her on Instagram
but I just feel absolutely blessed to be
like to be hooked up with her and how I
got hooked up with her was through
school she's a teacher at the school but
she was never my teacher and I had good
relationships with some of my teachers
as I went through so once I graduated
and a gig came up one of my teachers
text me and said hey I know someone who
needs someone are you available and I
was like yeah and that's how we hooked
up and ever since then we've just been
like inseparable uh-huh no she's like
just taking me everywhere with her and
all of my successes to her because she
worked her ass off and is where she is
today and I'm lucky enough that she's
like hey come along with me you know and
I can kind of piggyback off of that
success that she's already had so I'm
like so grateful to to her and the
opportunity to work with her and the
connection I made you know from my other
teacher to meet her is it's just amazing
so um let's finish my eyebrows cuz they
look kind of crazy with just like I look
like Spock up in here so I'm gonna fill
in then I think I should just make
probably a whole video on my experiences
on set just because I also don't feel
like I can say too too much cuz it's
like I honestly have been working for
two and a half
once now and it's just kind of exploded
I don't like to just one that's not my
style to be like let me tell you cuz I'm
the best like that's so the opposite of
me if anything downplay myself way too
much another thing I realized that I
want to stop doing is saying sorry so
much I say sorry all the time for like
things that aren't even my fault
it's like why am I saying sorry for it
and I've just noticed it more and more
especially on set that I will say like
oh I'm sorry and like no one else says
sorry and I just feel like so weak and
pathetic when I do it I think that's the
best my eyebrows are gonna get today I
like to have nice eyebrows but I also
just fun like 17 years and I feel like
my angles are always a little messed up
like this one's always a little more
like not as angled and this one's always
like more down but that's just the way
to so let's put some clear brow gel on
that cuz this video was getting really
long really best to kind of finish up
set and stuff I'm about to go to set
actually later today to help assist her
and that's a thing too I mostly assist
her on two shows and then I actually did
get my own show though where I was like
the makeup artist well there's someone
else for different interview days but
you know I was like anyway it's
confusing a whole other video that's all
I could say and I can't wait to to share
with you guys once it becomes like I can
share I'm gonna share a ton and like
you'll see it on my Instagram because
I'm gonna try to like promote it because
I want it obviously to be successful
because I want to season two anyway I
think the last couple questions here are
from Tia Schmidt I will leave her
channel link down below as well she
wanted just like to hear about my
wedding a little bit so I thought I
would talk about that a little bit and
she also want to know about lighting
equipment and camera stuff so I'm not
sure if I even know quite what my
camera's are I have a Canon Rebel t2i
I know these are like older school
cameras I have old-school everything I
am lucky enough to have like really
powerful machines but there's still like
old school even my Mac computer is like
old-school Mac you can see again no man
scram geez I just took a picture of me
editing today and you can see that
that's like an old Mac and then my
lights are actually like set Sam made I
will try to find a video where he saw
someone make
lights out of like a flag holder and a
like baking sheet that has like a lid on
the top and he likes screw did he like
me
Akeem made these lights if I can find
that video I'll link it down below but
he basically just followed that video
made lights for me which is so awesome
and so sweet and that's what I used for
my lighting I don't think my lighting is
very good at all I would love to get
soft boxes and have just like more
professional consistent lighting
especially with swatching or reviewing
things but it is what it is right now
and it works like you know it could be
worse so that's just like my lighting
situation and that but let's just talk
about my wedding while I get ready the
rest of the way because we need to like
finish this I'm gonna prime my eyes I'm
using this tiny sample of the shadow
insurance from two-face I'm just trying
to use this up and like halfway there
halfway there yeah and I just use a
little bit of that this is an okay one
it's not like my favorite ever but it
works okay let's talk about wedding
stuff I don't really talk about my
wedding very much because I really
wasn't a bridezilla at all I'm kind of
surprised I wasn't cuz I can be a little
feisty but I also was finishing college
okay let's start with when we got
engaged me and Sam got engaged in Paris
in the beginning of 2014 and then when
we came back I was graduating that year
from college with two degrees in many so
I was finishing up school that was super
stressful I was working full-time I
worked full-time basically through my
whole college and trying to plan a
wedding we got married in November of
2014 so we didn't have a huge time to
like get a lot of things done on top of
fact that I was graduating and I got
promoted to store manager of a different
store I used to work for a justice if
you guys didn't know it's weird because
I feel like I tell I've told you guys
this before because I have but it's like
that's like a year ago
like a lot of you guys are new and don't
know this stuff so yeah I got promoted
that your it was just like so much to
get that happened in like such a small
span of time so I just like was really
stressed out with the wedding and
everything and my biggest thing is I
just wanted it to be outside and like a
really nice venue so we got married in
downtown Phoenix and it was an outside
cute little historic home we could go
inside the home
but the backyard was absolutely
beautiful sadly the venue is no longer
available because they sold the house
and so it's not like a venue like that
anymore but it was just really pretty
and we just did like Mexican food at the
wedding because I like Mexican food one
it's cheaper but to like I my favorite
food to like Mexican food and Chinese
food and I wanted something on my night
like that I actually wanted to eat like
I don't give I don't care what you guys
want like this is my wedding and I want
to eat food that I would actually want
to eat on my wedding night so that's
what we did we didn't have like an open
bar a hundred percent
our venue didn't let us have like hard
alcohol except for like a couple
signature cocktails so I had like a
Bellini maker we rented out a Bellini
maker and that's what we had for like
signature drink and then we just had
wine and beer and lemonade and water I
think it was a really good time I feel
like it was a really nice wedding we
recently went through pictures I
seriously have never printed out
actually I have because I gave someone a
picture I think my grandma for Christmas
I gave her a picture of me and Sam and
her at our wedding but I mean like I
haven't really gone through the pictures
I don't know I feel let me move on to
the next step okay let's take some
shadow I'm not even gonna set my
eyeshadow primer today I don't think cuz
I didn't put that much on anyway but I'm
gonna go in with Coastal Scents pumpkin
pie it's the here I've been using
it everyday and I'm gonna just put this
in the crease and all over the lid
basically just everywhere cuz I really
like this shade this is so hard to do
this many things wow it's so much more
pigmented when you don't put a base
Calicut you know me and my husband paid
for our wedding so we didn't have like
you know a ton of funds because we were
self paying for everything my mom did
pay for my dress and my grandma did give
me some like some money for flowers but
overall I mean you know we paid for the
wedding we tried to do it as low budget
as we could without it being too you
know cheesy it's still gonna be like
something I remember forever so but
looking back I honestly I would have
been fine going to the courthouse and
going out to dinner with just like
friends and family and stuff afterward
or something because I just love
traveling and I really wish we could
have just traveled more like taking a
month off after we got me
and just did that for our honeymoon
instead of spending so much money on one
day that's the thing it's like one day
and obviously if I'm being honest with
you my wedding day is not the best day
of my life like I don't even know what
the best day of my life has been but I
wouldn't say it's my wedding day I love
Sam
hi everyone who knows me knows that I
like I love Sam but I don't think he
would even say that's the best day of
his life it's it's one day out of your
whole life and I just think that's so
much pressure to put on one day I just I
don't ever remember having like that
fairytale what do you think let's move
on really fast so um I'm gonna put some
liner on we're almost done guys we're
almost there I'm gonna be using my Urban
Decay liner in Roche I'm gonna tight
line and just put some on the bottom
lash line I'll try to leave this footage
and if you want to see me look like I'm
sending the devil with how my eyes go
back behind my head some people can do
this so classy one of the girls I work
on whoo just like goes like this and
like does it I'm like what how how can
you do it so nice and that's a tight
line mom this is how you tight line so
you know she asked me she was like what
does that mean
there you go mom that's how you do it
and that's just gonna thicken up your
lashes without taking up any lid space
now that my eyes are red I'm gonna take
a little bit more of that same pumpkin
pie shadow with a smudger brush and put
on my lower lash line but I don't want
anyone to think too that I think that
everyone should feel like this about
their wedding because I think that
everyone should do them and that's part
of the reason that I'm even telling you
guys how I feel because I also think
that I should be able to do me I seem
just like I hate weddings it's not like
that it's just spending like $30,000 on
one day of your life is like for one
party it better be a great gatsby party
I'll spend 30 thousand on that if I had
it but my wedding no that sounds so you
bet
anyway that's just me anyway okay let's
put some mascara on I've been using the
smashbox x-rated mascara recently and i
do like it especially as it dries out I
like it more and I just put this on my
top lashes and my bottom lashes but me
and Sam will be married two years this
November
we've been together a total of nine
years and I think that that is part of
the reason that the wedding just didn't
mean as much to me I I don't have
anything to prove to anyone you know
I've already been with him for forever
it feels like and I already know I love
you and I don't need to prove that to
anyone you know by having this big fancy
show of a party and I don't think that a
wedding the fancier the wedding doesn't
mean the more love there is you know
what I mean I think if anything it
probably might go the opposite way I
also have a video of like when salmon
proposed to me I might eventually post
that it's the sweetest video he made it
for me on my birthday right before I
moved out here we moved out here in
January of 2015 it's just been a lot
we've done so much in the last like two
years it's crazy
I'd eventually post that because I think
it's the sweetest video I guess I want
to share how often my husband is with
everyone okay so I just finished putting
on my mascara and the only other thing
that I would do is add a little bit of
an inner corner highlight I don't think
I brought a brush out for that though so
I guess I'll just try to use my fingers
and I'm using the NARS palette that's
what I've been using just because again
I'm trying to use it up or hit pan on
that shadow and honestly that would be
my everyday routine I wouldn't do much
else I might pull up on probably just a
balm though or a product in my one of my
pans that I'm trying to do and that's
everything I hope you guys enjoyed this
video sorry I was so scatterbrained it's
so hard to like do makeup and be focused
on that but also be telling a story
hopefully it wasn't too bad and thanks
so much for everyone who asked questions
I really do appreciate it everyone will
be linked down below everyone I
mentioned I'll try to make sure I link
anything and everything that I possibly
can something that I will see you later
