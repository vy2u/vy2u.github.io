Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to be another get ready
with me I've been going through my
drawers today and I've kind of even been
decluttering some stuff which is crazy
because I just did a huge declutter so
it's like the declutter after the
declutter I might film a video if I have
enough stuff for that but anyway I
thought I would just get on camera talk
to you guys get ready I kind of prefer
these two tutorials just because my
lighting isn't the best my setups not
the best the setup of this is just a
little bit more laid-back and a little
bit more my style personally so
hopefully you guys like it it seems like
you guys do I'm gonna be going with like
a red lip and like a sparkly eye so a
little bit different they've already put
moisturizer and eye cream on and now I'm
gonna go in and prime today I'm gonna be
using the kiss pro touch smoothing
primer I did a whole kiss first
impressions video I'll leave it link
down below if you want to check it out
and in that video I did use this and I
liked it but I didn't love it and I've
been using it more and I do like it the
more you use it I don't think it fills
in pores but it definitely does kind of
give a nice like soft smoothing effect
and the consistency on it kind of tricks
me because it feels almost thick in the
hands but when you put it on your face
and after it kind of sinks in it does
feel very light and almost like has a
powder finish for foundations today I'm
gonna be using the Eden minerals noir
skin this is an illuminating foundation
and it is just a bit too dark for me in
a little bit pink I'm gonna be mixing it
with my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD this
is the color 117 and this is a little
bit light for me right now because I
have a little bit of a tan going on and
it's also a little bit more yellow toned
so together I feel like they're gonna
make a pretty decent shade so anyway
like I would i was kind of mentioning in
the beginning and i'm gonna like go off
of that but i really just feel like my
quality of my videos i really want to
step it up so i messed around with the
settings on my camera today which i
never do I usually just like the
lighting looks bad and then I'll add
like harsher lights but I actually went
in I was looking up some videos I'm like
what ISO is and what aperture is and
shutter speed I don't know I don't even
know what I did but I definitely feel
like it's a bit brighter and I don't
think in a bad way so let me know what
you guys think of this if you can even
tell or whatnot
I even did like a little test video and
everything so fingers crossed it looks
better to blend my foundation and I've
really been enjoying brushes either like
a kabuki buffing brush or for today's
look I kind of want a little bit of a
lighter foundation coverage and I really
like a stippling brush for that this is
the Eden minerals one and it just blends
foundation in really nicely and doesn't
give me too much coverage right now in
my life I feel like there's a lot of
change on the horizon like it's not
quite here yet so I feel like I'm almost
preparing myself for it I don't know if
it's going to be changed that happens
just naturally like Oh things are
changing and that's just life and you
know next chapter or if it's gonna be me
creating that change and you know
flipping the page myself but I'm really
excited for it and I really feel like by
the end of this year beginning of next
year I definitely am gonna be just doing
different things I think we might move
maybe I don't know it's all things like
just we're talking about right now but I
definitely am feeling open to the change
I've made a habit out of the life I have
right now and I really just don't want
to be comfortable with this habit I want
to create a new habit and move on to
something else I'm really excited about
it I hope that that actually happens I
hate talking about stuff prematurely
because I don't want things to like not
pan out or end up changing and you know
it just seems like I'm a liar but that's
kind of the thing with YouTube you're
like almost writing a diary entry that
everyone can read and see and watch and
refer back to so keep that in mind we're
evolving and changing people I am really
liking the way my foundation was I think
this is just I just really love the new
way I'm doing foundation the new way I'm
looking at my skin and looking at how I
apply makeup I just I really never
thought I'd see the day when I didn't
want full coverage but it's common for
concealer I'm going to be going in with
the Maybelline master conceal this is in
my project pan 13 by Halloween and I'm
just going to squeeze out a dot of that
and I'm going to be
this underneath the eyes now although I
like using a brush on my face I really
just like using the beauty blender under
the eyes I feel like it just is kind of
gentle more gentle gentler on that area
so with all those changes I have a few
things that I wanted to bring up that I
wanted to maybe do on my channel so I'm
gonna start probably a makeup artist
series you guys know I love freakin
series and the reason I love series is
it just gives me confines of what to do
my content in obviously I can do content
any Content I want to it's my channel
when you have all the options it
sometimes is overwhelming but when I
create these kind of niche series
I feel more creative almost creating
those and then working within those
confines it's kind of like think of the
show chopped and it's like yeah they
could make them cook anything like
here's a whole kitchen whip up something
awesome but instead they give them like
four ingredients and say make an entree
you know and they have to make an entree
out of this weird ass stuff and that's
what I kind of feel like I'm trying to
do with series and just with confines
like I want to find something that's
project pan or more consumer-friendly
and how can I make something like that
on my channel or I'm a pro makeup artist
how can I kind of talk about that and
how can I get information out about that
oh this series or this video that would
fit well into that category of series so
not just kind of like a look inside my
brain on that I've also been wanting to
do a I hauled it but did I like it type
of video on my channel and I know Nikki
Murphy does those I know TIFF I don't
like know how to say her channel name
I'll leave her channel and Nikki's down
below but she also does a series like
that but I personally just that name is
really long and I feel like I already
have some long titles in my own series
so I was trying to think of like a one
that just kind of fit me more and I
don't know just a different name than
that for me and I was thinking of doing
it called haul in retrospect it's kind
of like mercury in retrograde although
it has nothing to do that and just kind
of sounds like it to me and that's it
really no other connection but I think
that's what I'm going to call them my
halls in retrospect and I'll probably
just number them I just have been
bringing a lot more products into my
collection not necessarily from me
purchasing a ton but more brands have
been reaching out I've been applying for
a lot of things on opt Elysee so I just
want a way that I can just go more in
depth with some products come back to
you after I've tried things a little bit
longer than just maybe a haul video that
just kind of solves the problem of just
hauling and hauling and hauling and
never seeing products again where is
this well actually if I do haul stuff I
can actually tell you later what I think
about it whether you should buy it
whether you shouldn't with enough time
for me to test stuff out but not so far
away that it's like three years ago I
hauled this stuff so hopefully you guys
will like videos like that I tend to
really enjoy them that's part of the
reason I want to do them as well and
just so we can move on to the next step
I'm done with concealer I'm just gonna
powder today I'm going to be using this
Sephora powder this is the micro smooth
powder and the reason I'm using this is
because it doesn't give quite just like
a really flat matte finish it has a
little bit of a sheen to it I guess I'm
just gonna be using a smaller brush than
I normally would I'm gonna use this to
set under my eye I'm not going for her
super bright under-eye I just want it to
be set under there but I don't
necessarily need it to be SuperDuper
bright I also ordered a ton of stuff
from Sephora I had it was all gift cards
I think I spent $5.00 in my own money
the rest was gift cards I've had some
gift cards from a flea and I also had a
gift card from a shoot that I did as
like a thank-you gift so I had some
money sitting around and you know
thinking of all these new products I'm
going to add to my collection and I just
don't want them sitting with things I'm
not using I just want to have good stuff
I'm going in with bronzer this is the
laura geller baked bronzer it's the
lightest one and kind of going along
with that mindset
I'm more into kind of rotating my
products and getting good use and just
trying new things and not being bored
with my stuff then using up a whole
product and then having like seven other
things that don't even get touched so I
was thinking about doing a shop my stash
or something whether that's like
shopping my stash for the week or for
get ready with me I know that those
videos are very popular as well and I'm
hoping that with those videos I'll be
inspired to reach for different things
in my collection try out different
products not just use old favorites and
also not just use project pan items and
just have a more well used well-rounded
collection let me know what you think
about any of these ideas I'd love to
hear your thoughts on it
and something that's nice about having
just so many different kind of like
series or video ideas is that I don't
just have like 4 videos that I've known
for two videos that I've known for I
kind of just have a broader range and so
I can have more options what I want to
film I don't feel like I have to be just
confined to a couple options and if I'm
not feeling those then I'm out of luck
or something for blush I'm going to be
going in with another Eden minerals
product I really like their stuff
they're probably one of my favorite
brands that I've tried from optically
they just consistently have good
products to me and they're just in the
vein of what I'm feeling right now a
little bit more natural you know it's
not too done up but it's just it's just
pretty makeup so I'm using this blush
this blush is in half torn and I'm just
gonna put a little bit of this on the
cheeks it has a nice little bit of Sheen
to it but nothing too much and then for
highlighter today I'm using my Urban
Decay eye shadow in illusion I am so
glad I rediscovered this in my declutter
series this is just so pretty it's one
of my favorite highlighters I think ever
it just illuminates my face in such a
nice way it's not overstated it doesn't
look metallic it's not too bright
it almost looks invisible on the skin
until it hits the light so it's not too
light or too dark for my skin tone it's
just beautiful I just didn't with it I
hate that it was like in a limited
edition like palette I don't think you
can get it so you know and also it
doesn't unless you're my exact skin tone
it's not necessarily gonna work on you
the same so I just suggest looking into
your collection and checking out I
shadow is that maybe you don't love on
the eye because they're not bright
enough for you they don't do enough in
trying those on your skin because they
might just be the perfect highlight
that's what I found with this and I'm
obsessed so I'm gonna go off camera now
and do my eyebrows and prime my eyes
so to do that I'm going to be using my
ELF brow pencil in taupe you guys know I
love it I'm also going to be using the
Lancome source stills brow styler this
is in the color blonde you guys know
we've also been loving that and I will
be priming with my Maybelline eye primer
alright I am back my eyebrows are a
little thicker than normal but that's
okay I'm doing something a little bit
different today I'm gonna be going in
with this brow duo pencil from from
billion-dollar brows and I'm going to be
putting a bit of this underneath the
brow just to give it a little bit more
definition and to kind of make it a
little bit more yeah defined I just
thought that this would be a nice
addition to this look since it's a
little bit more classic and it's funny
because my hair is like the most fun
classic thing for my eyes to day I
wanted to use something that I haven't
used on camera before this is the violet
Voss holy grail Pro palette I got this
at the beginning of the year when I
worked I maps and it was part of my
gratis this is what I chose and it's
such a beautiful palette I honestly
think that the colors in here are just
so pretty I think they did a great job
on this palette and I know there's a lot
of controversy of whether these are
pigmented or not I find them to be super
pigmented super blendable and I don't
have any complaints with it so I just
thought I would use it today because I
need some just kind of more neutral
colors so that I can lay down a nice
base before I put the glitter on so I'm
going to be going in with the shade
thanks a lot a and I'm using this as my
kind of like setting shade it's a little
bit darker than I would like to normal
use but it works when you just use it
kind of lightly all over the lid
next I'm going to go into at the shape
transition how appropriately-named and
we're just going to be working this into
the crease another thing I wanted to
bring up today is that I was watching
the Kim Kardashian and Jacqueline Hill
video there was so much strong I was
reading about drone while I was watching
other videos about and I just decided
you know why I need to watch it myself
if I even want to watch these videos
because I just don't want to be someone
who's forming an opinion based off other
people's opinions I want to see the
actual original content and then
go from there and I know a lot of people
are hating on it and I can see some
reasons why but I also just feel like my
goodness people like first off Kim
Kardashian I know a lot of people hate
her but she sounded really just nice and
chill in that video I really enjoyed
watching her I get what people have hate
for the Kardashians I guess but I also
feel like it's just so how can you
really just despise people you don't
even know that well like you don't even
know them in person you don't know what
they're like that's just so weird to me
it's just super weird same with like you
know YouTube famous people like
Jacqueline Hill I think that's all I
want to do for transition I'm gonna go
on with are you kidding me and I'm going
to just put this on the outer portion of
my eye and just deepen up the outer
corner a little bit so I think
Jacqueline did a fine job she did talk
over her a bit which I'm sure was a
little bit irritating and it happened
quite often but I also feel like they
don't know each other they're not
friends you know they didn't do this
clap because they're just besties and
that sometimes the nature of collabing
or you know working with someone you
haven't worked with before and then
filming it like think of the first time
you met people at your office or
something and then imagine filming that
time like that would be awkward probably
I can't blame her for feeling awkward
and then on top of that think of the
fact that this isn't just anyone this is
freaking Kim Kardashian
I don't normally watch Jacqueline's
videos I only watch like certain ones I
think the last one I watch from her was
her swatch video I don't think it's as
bad as everyone said but I don't think
it was like the best thing ever I think
it's cool that she got to meet her and
do that whole thing but it was just kind
of weird I think I'm gonna go even just
the tiniest bit deeper in the outer
corner and I'm going to go in with a
little bit of a smaller brush this one
here from Ecotools I'm gonna go into the
shade a teddy bear and just very very
lightly keeping it closest to the lash
line just deepen up this outer portion
even more in the last step for the
shadows I'm going to take a little bit
of hashtag which is this orange color
and I'm just going to kind of sweep it
over the tops of everything and just add
a little bit more warmth to the
transition and the blending out of these
shades I'm gonna be as
badi ography kind of pressed pigment
glitter thing this is the color sparkler
I bought this from Oxley and I've used
it once it was really pretty I wanted to
do this really pretty like green teal
eye with the metal matte palette from
Kat Von D but I never did it so I
thought I would just use it today in a
little bit more wearable fashion but if
you want to see that let me know and I
will try to get it filmed I'm just going
in with my finger one I just feel like
it's gonna apply the pigment the best
and I also don't want to dirty a brush
let's get real this is a really pretty
way to add sparkle and that's it super
easy I had like one piece of glitter
fall down but other than that they've
all kind of stayed where they should be
and I didn't even use like a sticky
primer to specifically stick this on I'm
just gonna finish up the lower lash line
I'm gonna go in with transition and just
keep it really light under the eyes for
liners today I'm gonna go in with this
one from Laura Geller this is the color
brown sugar I'm just trying to use it up
but it's a nice dark brown I'm also
gonna be lining my waterline with a
white liner and then for mascara I'm
gonna be using the only mascara I have
but I did order some mascaras from
Sephora so I will have some more options
soon but this is the Eden minerals this
is the err Volume Mascara not saying I
don't like this but I just this is
literally the only mascara and have in
my collection which is so weird I had so
many for so long but I tend to just use
the same one over and over until I
finish it up and this one's getting dry
it's almost there so we are also with
the eyes for liners and all that I did
have a bit of a mishap on this side with
the mascara so I had to go in and clean
that up so if it looks different that's
why I'm gonna highlight my inner corners
using the color crystal in the palette I
just want a little bit of light I'm just
trying to blend that out a little bit
more so it's not quite as harsh I wasn't
expecting it to show up that bright and
last we're gonna be going in with lips
this is kind of a start of the show with
the glitter this is a red pencil and
this is definitely a more orange --red
when I go red I like to go more warm and
orange I just like those colors on me I
think they're fun that's just my
preference this I believe is a limited
edition color from NARS it's in
Erico I believe is how you pronounce
that and hopefully even find something
similar there's a ton of like orange e
Reds out there I'm just going to be
putting this on the lips I'm not using a
lipliner and I'm gonna stop talking now
so I can actually do this I think the
reason I love these colors so much is
because it just brings out the blue in
my eyes like as soon as I put this on my
eyes turn piercing blue and I love it I
usually don't wear bright lip colors I
usually do something like a balm most of
the time or just something really light
and natural and I feel like I especially
stray away from Reds because my hair is
pink and I feel like it kind of clashes
but I thought I would just go out of my
comfort zone today do something a little
bit more fun and I really do like it
it's so pretty it's just kind of like
classic but still not too much I hope
you guys enjoyed it as well and that's
everything for this get ready with me
again I would really love to hear any of
your thoughts down below on anything I
talk about and if you have any
suggestions for videos you'd like to see
me do that I don't currently do I would
love to hear those as well thank you so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
