born thank you so much for watching I'm
doing another get ready with me today
where we're just getting ready talking
about some stuff I don't know if you
guys have heard about this palette from
Anasazi a called subculture love but
anyway I thought I would use the modern
renaissance palette today because I did
order the subculture palette and I just
want to have like fresh thoughts and
what I think about this I mean you guys
already know I love this palette but I
just want to like use it really close in
conjunction with the subculture palette
once it gets here so that I can do a
review and a less stupid and all that on
it anyway we can talk more about that as
we go so I've already moisturized my
face I'm going to prime this is a new
primer for me this is the Cokie smooth
glow hydrating foundation primer I got
this term oxalate and cocci is a really
affordable brand which you guys know I
love affordable so I'm hoping that some
of these products work out I got I have
another thing I'm going to use which it
wasn't when I orders but they're out of
what I ordered because I think I want to
be talking or someone big did something
with their products so I think they sold
out really nice on some things I'm just
rubbing on in my first impression of
this is pretty nice but I feel like it's
almost mattifying for it to be like a
glowing primer which I don't have to
sort of have a problem with if you had
dry skin you'd probably be like wait
what
that's not glowy it's a little sticky
but it feels good okay for foundation
I'm just using my bizzle and cream
compact I'm just trying to use this up
in my project pan so we're continuing on
using it so I bought the subculture
palette I did it if you guys are
wondering I know Tom I don't know if you
guys know him hope that Tom I'm going to
leave his channel link down below
he just started not too long ago but he
messaged me on Instagram and was like
please do look stupid on the subculture
palette and I was like yeah so we talked
about it for you know a couple texts or
whatever messages about getting it and I
told him I just bought it so in case any
of you are wondering I did buy it it was
a palette I was really looking forward
to and was so excited about just think
you did something a little bit different
and I
that so much is so born coming out
everything is just the same and I get it
because a lot of it's pretty like even
if it's the same it can still be pretty
and I respect that but I just wanted
something different and I was so happy
to have that palette come out but then
all our reviews which I'm sure none of
you guys are thinking no there are
reviews on that palette everywhere and I
watched
Alissa's I believe us her name I'm
subscribed to her and I saw her struggle
with it and then I saw rob Beauty
Christie's review and I loved her I
think she's so awesome and she hated it
and then from there hits and I'm
not discounting anyone's experience with
the palette but you you seriously would
have thought it was a scandalous as like
one of these really crappy companies but
it's like it's nice honest obvious they
didn't like some of these not trying to
like do people or do any of that so I
don't understand what everyone's like
freaking out to the extent that they are
it's like if you don't like the palette
you don't like the pellet I don't know I
don't have it yet so who knows maybe
I'll be one of them but I just feel like
it was like two really poor reviews came
out about it and it didn't work for them
in their first impressions and then from
there it went to like crazy town
everyone like is posting reviews with
WTF WTF in the title like I am so sick
of WTF is any videos like I'm so over at
makeup is not that insane where you need
to be like what the this lotta liner oh
it's like I'm so over it I'm filming
another video after this about five
things that I hate about big beauty
gurus spoilers that's one of them I did
I can't I mean I get it but again Robbie
to Christie she does not in her title
and I do love her eyes and she's so good
and I honestly do you think that she cut
through and does no thing but
she's just saying what she feels and I
get to this part of the game of YouTube
but it's just so irritating when it's
everyone and it was like as soon as they
did it it's like everywhere I feel like
everyone maybe they don't like the
palettes
they're making this video it's like yo
get it freakin powdery and it doesn't
blend cool move on like if you don't
want it don't get it or know that going
in but I can't have all these first
impression reviews of it that people are
just like look it's powdery it's like oh
I can't it's so frustrating to me
assignations down I'm going to go on
this concealer this is just my
Maybelline one I'm panning as well and
I'm going to use a Beauty Blender to put
this under my eyes I'd love to know what
you guys think about it if you guys have
had it I don't know I just I hate that
it's just so much girl I feel like
sometimes people are looking for just so
much drama things to be situations and I
saw Stephanie Nicole video I just
thought today like right before I film
this because I'm actually filming like
in the morning usually I film a it's
pretty late because I don't know by the
time I get up and I'm kind of filming
and all that it's like 1:00 or 2:00 in
the afternoon but it's right now 10:13
and I've already been I've been up since
like 5:50 because I've been trying to
wake up with Sam when I am NOT like
working because then we're working the
same hours and when he gets home I don't
know we're just on the same schedule
anyway I'd love to know you guys think
about the subculture palette if you've
tried it or just like what you think
about all the freaking reviews I just
feel like it's just so much drama and I
don't again I just don't feel like the
brand they didn't do this to create
drama they weren't trying to like come
out with a shitty product so I don't
know why everyone's taking the stance
like they tried to do that or pull one
over on us anyway I'm going to be using
this milk makeup baked bronzing stick
just like a cream bronzer I've really
been liking it it's just super easy it
blends out crazy easy and I like it it
does have a smell dose I'm going to
mention that in a comment and it does I
don't particularly love the snow but
it's not like the worst ever like I said
since I ordered it I will be doing a
less stupid on it but I wanted to wait
until I had it since I'm ordering it to
do what stupid so I can actually try to
find colors that are similar or as
similar as I have in my collection
instead of just going off of pictures
and swatches online and trying to get it
up sooner you know I
no I partial pardon me and just like I
don't ever want to be a part of the
frenzy of it all like people freaking us
out about the palette and honestly I
think this goes into an issue I have
with just people who watch like just as
viewers it's like people are allowed to
have different opinions and you can have
a different opinion than them and we
don't all have to have the same freaking
one I don't know I just feel like it's
such a sheet mentality with some of
these bigger youtubers and everything
and it's like oh please let me know if
you like it nor decision or your review
is what's hinging on me and it's like I
think that's great and if anyone's like
that with me I appreciate that you you
know think of my opinion that highly but
at the same time it's like man it's not
that big of a deal if you want to try it
out try it out and guess why if you
don't like it return it and that's why I
waited until it came out at Sephora to
order it I didn't order it on the first
launch I figured that they'd be enough
palate at some point to get it it's okay
guys
okay not to like it and not to have it I
don't know I'll be definitely
disappointed if that palate doesn't work
out for me if I can't get it to work but
I don't know I just feel like it's
blowing up to a crazy deal and it's this
isn't like a Gerard cosmetics calling
Tarina kaboom ugly deal you know it's
like that didn't blow up to nearly as
big as this why not what the heck that's
like an actual issue right anyway okay
moving on I think that's it for cream
products I'm using a new powder today
and this is also from Toki this is a
green redness correction powder now I
just ordered the regular translucent but
again they ran out of it so this is what
we're trying today part of me was like
thinking in my head like how does that
work I get what Green is supposed to do
but it's like it's a powder so you
wouldn't necessarily use it first even
though it does say you can use it under
or over makeup I'm just going to use it
like I wanted a regular dream listen and
see what happens I'm just I don't want
to look weird I'm going to a lunch date
after this I just don't think that this
is
like a product that actually does that
much honestly it's like you don't tell
barely any foundation on for this
actually cancel anything it's such a
light color it only worked for really
fair skin tones honestly it's really if
you're going to correct with green I
would just do it in a normal concealer
situation I will use this more if it's
you know what my like more than just
first impressions are about it but off
the bat that's my first box it looks
fine as for setting the whole face I
don't think it really did anything like
freaking weird or something so but I
don't think it did what it's also
supposed to do because I don't have any
redness up there put foundation on a
little point a foundation right I'm
going to go in on the outer perimeters
of my face with a another powder I've
been doing this lately and I like it I
just feel like it looks good I don't
know I'm gonna move on to bronzer I'm
using my Real Techniques pointed L brush
and I'm going to be putting on this
Milani bronzer and I'm just going to
kind of lightly in the same areas I put
that milk stick I'm over everyone making
everything out feature on that I hate
all the drama especially when it's not
real it is not real drama
I get that everyone's opinion means
something and whatever but like I just
hate seeing the same reviews over and
over and my biggest gripe was a lot of
these subculture ones is that I'm down
with first impressions
hello I'm doing first impressions right
now I've been getting ready but I say
clearly that this is the first
impressions and it isn't like my final
review and I totally and find what's
coming back later and being like hey
guess what that green correcting powder
is the best it's actually so so good or
hey it still isn't my favorite or
whatever um but when you're doing a
review on a palette or something like
that but ah I don't know especially when
you've heard a bunch of crap about it
it's like you do not do first
impressions do a real review do
something where you've actually tried it
like and again not everyone did this I'm
not
saying that every single review that
came out wasn't thought out or whatever
I'm just saying it's all a lot of stuff
and it's just it's the first time you're
using it you can tell in your like when
you're showing the palette and close-ups
that you haven't touched the palette
when you did that and then you're doing
a whole video saying whether or not you
think someone should purchase it in a
first impressions but you're calling it
a review and you're saying pretty like
crazy you know things about a palette or
about a makeup item without actually
testing it for a long period of time if
you're going to do a first impressions
then make it a first impression to say
first impressions using it this way this
is my these are my thoughts on it anyway
I'm going in with a highlighter this is
the kiss strobing palette and light I'm
using the middle shade I think another
thing too about this whole candle we can
call it that is that people are just
like making up things like I don't
understand why the first thing isn't
like this is what they wanted I mean the
palette is obviously super pigmented why
is it not our first you know thought
that they wanted to make a palette like
this like maybe it's a little bit softer
than they wanted but like overall this
is the product that they had spent
months and months creating and put out
on the market this is what they wanted
it to be why does it have to be that
it's a bad batch or it's this or it's
that and like having all these
conspiracies it's like it's crazy I know
I just I felt like there's just like
ridiculous thing going on especially
specifically with the scandal that is
just like it's hard for me man and again
I don't want to just count everyone's
individual Janine's it's more just like
the fact that all of this is coming out
at once and I just feel like I really do
feel when a prime mileage lacasa I
really do feel like there are a lot of
people using this situation as like a
trending topic to talk about and that's
like super frustrating to me I get
making that YouTube money I get it I
would love to make some YouTube money
but I just think that it's like all
these little reviews coming out of the
woodwork and even some of these bigger
people you can tell the ducati
have them in my channel before welcome
thank you for you know coming by
definitely subscribe anyway let's get
into this review of the thing and it's
like you can tell that they know that
this is going to get them or they're
hoping this will get them some traction
that they're going to get a lot more
views from people who don't normally
know their channel and hopefully gain
subscribers off of it and although I
respect the hustle and I do YouTube
myself I just I think that's kind of
frustrating to me I don't know why it
just kind of resonated a wrong line I'm
going to do my eyebrows really fast for
my eyebrows and make three products have
been using three products lately what
happened to me one elf eyebrow pencil
but I'm using the elf eyebrow pencil and
then I'm also using the colour-pop brow
pencil in the outer half and then I'm
using my Lancome brow gel to brush up
and like hold my brows in place I will
be back
eyebrows are on and we are ready to move
onto the palette again I'm using the
modern renaissance you know assam gym
and i rather was thinking and it's like
you know i don't know if it's because i
pan and actually use the products in my
collection or what and again I don't
have the subculture palette and I do
think it's super powdery don't get me
wrong I think that it's definitely
probably a huge thing but I often think
people don't remember how powdery this
palette is I know L will will know how
powder it is because you'd band like
every single color in here and I've hit
pan on three shadows and yes I've used
this palette a ton but the reason I've
hit pan is because these are so powdery
and if you look at a lot of the people
that are really big and totally love
this palette they don't have tan on it
and so it always makes me question how
often they truly use it because if you
used it a time you would have pan on it
honestly I know some people use shadows
really lightly so you know maybe that's
it but then use your shadows really
lightly with the subculture palette to I
don't know man uh I I expect this
palette to be something that maybe I
don't love or maybe it's harder to work
with well I'm still excited I don't know
it works for some people you know and I
think that might be it to is that you
have a certain technique that you do
when these shadows don't work and I
don't necessarily think you should
switch up how you do your eye shadows if
it doesn't work for you doesn't work for
you but I do think that there are good
things about it I'm the biggest thing
I'm worried about is the blending I
don't feel like I'm the best at blending
I feel like sometimes I have some nice
blended looks and other times it's a
little bit more difficult so I'm hoping
that I can get it to blend especially
with some of those darker colors but I'm
excited I feel like it's a challenge and
I feel like this is a real palette of
artistry this isn't a slap it on palette
so I'm excited for that and that's
something I was also thinking about like
you know a lot of these bigger youtubers
got their reviews up even though they
got them for PR so they could have put
them up sooner but they didn't and I
wonder if they weren't gonna even really
do that much about it like the
subculture palette is definitely not
everyone's cup of tea and so I wonder
why they didn't have these reviews or
they weren't really testing it
beforehand why did they wait they just
waited until it became like probably
trending it feels like I don't know man
I'm just speculating at this point you
know it's all not true oh but I don't
know I just have some I have some major
issues man with people trying to act
like it's just the worst thing ever and
I feel like so much of the beauty
community is about sensationalism right
now good bad whatever and it's like it's
okay to just have a this product would
work for these people why not these
people like it's okay I said that into
one of my last videos it's like sorry if
my reviews don't confirm something or
deny something it's just honest
information and how I feel about a
product and that's it there's no there's
nothing else if whatever view is and I
don't do my reviews to necessarily make
you buy a product I do on so that you
can get information about a product and
make a decision that's informed and you
can decide if that's going to fit your
lifestyle or not I cannot wait to hear
all of your guys's comments down below
and know what you guys think about this
whole situation and also let me know if
you want to see that let's do it because
I am excited to also do specific ultra
palate I was thinking about doing
earlier and now that it's kind of a flop
for a lot of people I feel like more
people will be wanting to look for you
than just you know not so I think it'll
be kind of actually helpful for a lot of
people to do that and like I'm going to
just use I don't know I've been just
looking Matt easy looks lately like I
want to just stop I'm so boring well you
guys saw my laughs left I looked kind of
crazy I kind of loved it and kind of was
like little Lauren what the heck I think
I'm just going to put a little bit of
burnt orange under my lash line on the
outer half I didn't even tell you what
colors I used so I will leave it all
link down below you like I always do
I've really been loving just simple
beauty lately I think that it just looks
so classic and smart in the British
sense and I love it
I feel the prettiest lately looking the
most like myself just enhanced you know
my thoughts on this palette - are still
the same I love this modern assange
palette I think it's so good but it is
powdery you know it blends nicely
it has great colors in it I mean I'm
almost done with this shadow which makes
me so sad but I'm really I'm super
excited and kind of nervous to get that
subculture palette though but I might it
might take me a second to get it up my
all my sauce and everything so I might
do a let's do pit before I even do a
review just because I do want to try it
out quite a bit before I just do it I
feel like there's enough first
impressions on it that that's not
necessarily super helpful at this point
I am going to do a little inner corner
though I forgot I'm just going to take
Vermeer which is like the light shimmery
shade and put it on my inner corner I
realized since this is all I'm doing I
don't really have that much left so I'm
going to tightline using my Laura Geller
brown sugar liners like a dark brown I'm
going to put some mascara on this is the
Urban Decay perversion probably going to
put some white eyeliner on and I'm also
going to put some lip product on which I
didn't bring anything out here so I will
go get that and I will show you guys the
final look okay I am back with
everything I decided to put rikugien
from NARS on my lips I've been so
obsessed with their lip pencils I mean I
always have loved them but the last
three videos I've worn
only NARS lip pencils I just love them
so much and that's everything for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed I'm glad I
could get you know the subculture drama
off my chest a little bit I'm excited to
hear your comments and thoughts on this
topic and I will see you my next video
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
