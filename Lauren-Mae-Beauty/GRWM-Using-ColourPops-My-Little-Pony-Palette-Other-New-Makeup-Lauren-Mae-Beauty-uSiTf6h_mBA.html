Lauren it feels so good to talk to you
guys because it's been a long time I
just wanted a moment to kind of like get
ready with you guys chat about some
stuff use some new products like just be
kind of chill um this is my first video
I'm filming kind of since I've been back
you guys saw the vlogs with me on set
and yeah I've just been really busy in
October so I wanted to say sorry I've
been gone so long but hopefully we
should be back to regularly scheduled
videos which are basically daily and
yeah let's just get into doing the face
I've already done my eyebrows because I
just I didn't want to do them okay I
just wanted to like have them done like
get that out of the way also really fast
if you hear like dogs barking or
anything it's like I don't know what's
going on of course it's like as soon as
you start filming I know everyone says I
and it's because it's true it's just
true even onset that's what happens like
literally you'll be like alright and
camera set and then the log loader will
come out you know anyway I'm done
talking about that first off I'm gonna
start with a primer this is the kiss Pro
touch smoothing primer I haven't used
this in a while and I'm just using that
as a base for my face how have you guys
been I hope you've been well and I hope
that your October has been you know good
and busy and fun I know I think I talked
about this in my last one but I know
October is like a huge thing for a lot
of people so I hope you're having fun I
have like one Halloween party that I'm
going to so I'm excited for that
something else for kind of like priming
and moisturizing this is something new
to me from Hockley it's the Clarins
mission perfection broad-spectrum
targets dark circles I don't know if
it's like an eye cream but it has a tint
to it so it has like a little brush and
you just brush a little on so I'm just
gonna put a little bit of that on it's
kind of orange I think but it's not very
pigmented so I guess it works out fine
because you cover this up anyway but if
you're super fair you might be able to
see this on the skin but I like that
it's a little bit darker in a lot of
ways too since it's like a one color
thing it'll fit a lot of people so for a
foundation today I'm going in with the
Lancome tight tint I dole I doll someone
told me how to say
I just forgot but this is the ultra
where stick instead of the liquid this
is like been my go-to I absolutely love
this thing it's probably gonna be in my
monthly favorites video because I
finally have tested it out enough to
know that I love it like this was
sticking up above the container when I
first got it and it's already like still
far down I use this all the time it just
makes getting ready easy and I love that
I have just been using it sometimes too
and it's been working I'm losing my tan
a little bit and I find that when I lose
my tan and not quite as warm as I am
with a tan it's just so easy it blends
out so smoothly on the skin I just I
love how fast it is to get ready using
this perfect and that's what I've been
into because it's like I'm getting ready
at like 2:00 in the morning I'm getting
ready at like 4:00 in the morning like
my call times have been a little bit
crazy before we go in with concealer I
kind of want to do my eyes so I'm gonna
go in with an eye primer this is the
Maybelline one I thought I would use the
new My Little Pony color pop palette
today I haven't used it yet at all so
this is like a first impressions I like
doing first impressions it might get
ready with me just because I don't know
I can I just have more time and then I
can come visit in a different video it's
just more of a chill video anyway so
yeah we're gonna use it together today
for the first time I got it a while ago
but I've just been too busy to even deal
with it so and this is what it looks
like I'm so excited I hope it's not too
too bright my lights right now I'm kind
of getting back into filming that dog
seriously alright so first from the
palette I'm gonna be taking this top
color it's like a white or really light
lavender I believe it's the color
butterscotch maybe it could be blossom
or butterscotch sometimes it's just so
hard oh wow all right I'm looking insane
already this has a lot more purple to it
once you actually put it on the eyeball
so that in mind I'm gonna try to keep
that on the actual base of the eyelid I
don't know what I want to do today with
this palette I'm gonna go crazy from
that up there are so many fun colors in
here a lot of them are like pinks and
purples and oranges which is something I
normally do but then there are those
blues and I feel like I should probably
go in with those since they're different
but then harmony is like well I'm gonna
do what I want I think I'm just gonna go
in first with this peachy matte color
and just play down the transition at
least I know that's not gonna look that
great with the green but I don't really
know where this look is gone all right I
think I figured out what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna use this peachy shade as a
transition I'm gonna go in with this on
the outer corner maybe add a little bit
of the pink and then on the lid I'm
gonna do a mix of these two blues I feel
like that's a nice compromise I'm not
ready for the full blue which is not
today I want to do it by just I don't
know I just want to feel pretty gosh
thing sometimes blues I just don't feel
pretty and okay so I'm gonna go in with
this shade here I believe that color is
Applejack
I really wish they would put them on so
it was easy to tell so far quality wise
these are going on just like all the
color pop shadows which you guys know I
really like I own all the little
palettes I was thinking about doing a
video where I do like a look with each
palette or something I don't know let me
know what you guys think I've just these
are my go-to s right now they're easy I
love that they're small and compact but
they have so many different colors in
them the quality like I said is really
nice so I am just so incredibly happy
with every one of them that I've gotten
and yeah I love them I really do this
would be a pretty look to just stop here
I would definitely do that and just like
wine my lips and stuff but we'll keep
going for the sake of the video next I'm
gonna go in with this blue shade I'm
using a flat shader brush tapping off
the extra and then I'm just going to be
placing that on the lid I'm still not
sure how this look is going to really
turn out but I don't know we're just
gonna go with it to deepen up the outer
corner I'm going in with a kind of like
purpley pink and I'm just going to be
blending that on top of that blue
just kind of melding the edges I'm
feeling very 80s at the moment I'm gonna
go back in with the orange shade and
just kind of blend out the edges I know
I think that's kind of fun looking I'm
gonna go in on the top lashline and I'm
going to add some of this should i add
the dark blue i'm gonna go in with the
dark blue and just kind of smudge it to
the outer half of my top lash line i do
have a bit of fallout so i'm just gonna
hand a brush that away
the reason i decided to do my concealer
after is just so i don't build up a
bunch of product so yeah but I still
wanted my base down I don't know helps
me get a better idea of the look for a
lower lashline I'm gonna go in with the
orange I'm just gonna probably do the
like warmer colors on the lower lash
line and just let the blue kind of be on
the lid and I'm going to put that like
duochrome shade the lighter blue on the
inner corner and I'm mixing the two
Pink's we used earlier and just kind of
smudging them and connecting them to the
top line the upper eyelid it's not work
does that make sense and then just for
fun I'm gonna go in with the orange and
just really build that color up on this
inner corner just so that way we see
that punch of orange I'm okay with this
I'm feeling it I did not bring out eye
liner so we're just gonna move on to
concealer for that I'm using another
newer product to my collection this is
the Estee Lauder Double Wear waterproof
concealer I got this from octa Lee and I
wanted to try this out because I thought
it might be like the Maybelline one
which you guys know I just finished up
in a project my halloween so I wanted to
try this out and I have been using this
I'm not sure how I feel about it I
thought I would like it more than I do
yeah I don't know that's all I can
really say about at the moment I thought
I would just have more coverage and I
I'm okay with having like a medium
covered to concealer that's kind of what
I prefer honestly but I just thought it
was gonna be more considering it's like
waterproof and the double wear formula
and all that and I also find that this
tends to I'm like it goes on lighter but
it dries down a bit darker to me so
that's just something to consider and
this one's a bit warm even though it's a
cool yeah it's one see light and I think
it definitely pulls warm so and I just
realized like I blended out underneath
my eyes with the shadow and they're now
going in and blending so I'm probably
gonna blend on top of that I'm gonna be
going in with my milk bronzer stick
today and I'm just going to be putting
that on the perimeter of the face and
I'll be blending it out with my Beauty
Blender I thought it would just be nice
to add a little bit of warmth and
definition I'm not trying to like super
sculpt but this just gives a nice base
and I really like this product I was
gonna blend it out with a Beauty Blender
but I think I'm just gonna use a brush
actually I wanted to let you guys know I
did order some stuff from that Rose gal
like plus-sized website it has come in
um I want I don't know if I want to make
a video on it still at least not like a
try on haul only cuz it's like basically
all the stuff was really really tiny and
I knew going in that it was going to be
a bit tiny because it's like Asian
sizing but it still was really tiny so I
just feel like nothing's even gonna like
look flattering for a Tryon and that's
like part of my whole review on it so I
don't know I might still do it or at
least the pieces that I kind of like but
that's also the thing it's like even the
pieces that were like okay like
everything just said like something I
like something was off about it and I
kind of had a feeling that that's how it
was gonna turn out but that was part of
the reason I wanted to try it out too
that I could let people know maybe I'm
just super picky but I don't think that
I am because seriously like I wear the
same crap all the time some of that
stuff just I don't know man I don't know
I'm just going back over with my Beauty
Blender so I'll make a video I just
don't know if there's gonna be a Tryon
portion I don't know I mean part of me
is just like I'm not ashamed like that's
what it looks like on my body but I feel
like safe doing that with you guys but I
don't necessarily know if I feel safe
doing that like on the internet and all
the other people that potentially you
could see that video and I know a lot of
people when they do like plus I stuff
get a lot of heat and as confident
as I am about myself I just I don't know
if I want to like deal with it more than
anything like I don't wanna deal with
that I don't know though I don't know
part I don't know
I'm seriously like back and forth on it
because I also I'm gonna order a bunch
of stuff from forever 21 because I just
like need new clothes so bad and I'm
thinking about doing like a haul try on
haul with that stuff too
so I don't know I don't want to like I
don't want this to be like a huge part
of my channel like I've mentioned but I
also kind of want to incorporate it
sometimes when I do happen to buy things
or whatnot so if you have any thoughts
or advice on that let me know down below
I'm liking this look so far I want to go
in and set my face that's what I want to
do sorry I'm looking down so much I'm
gonna go in and just set under my eyes
with this translucent powder from kiss
this one is nice but I feel like just
any translucent powder won't be good
that's what I like using under the eyes
just because it's like thin and doesn't
add too much of a layer in that delicate
area I've really been liking the way
that the under eye looks without setting
it like I really like that just really
fresh look but I concealer tends to
crease and if I'm working a really long
day like I just don't have time for that
so translucent powder to me is the next
best thing for the rest of my face I'm
using this powder from Revlon it's the
nearly naked I'm getting close guys I
only have a little bit of time left
before the finish 13 my Halloween is
over so I'm excited to be close to being
done with this I hope I can make it not
sure we only have a couple days so we'll
see speaking of project pans after my
finish 13 by Halloween I will be
starting a new project pan called the
twelve pans of Christmas I actually did
it last year with a group of women and
we decided we wanted to do it again and
we're like opening it up to like so so
many people so we have an email thing
going on and I'm kind of confused by it
plus I'm like super bad at keeping up
with that type of stuff um but we're
starting to post I believe on the 1st of
November is when we're all going to post
our videos you're picking 12 different
items and then I think there's something
about movies and picking your favorite
Christmas movie to hell
why are your items so yeah more
information on that there's a post that
Jacqueline made on her Instagram if you
want to check that out too like email
and be a part of the email chain I will
leave that down below but if anything if
you want to be a part of it please just
post on November 1st it's just like a
fun community thing we're trying to do I
know some people have already started
the 12 pants at Christmas so that's also
something too I just think it'd be fun
if we were all kind of doing something
like that anyway if I would just mention
that here because I'm kind of confused
and if someone can enlighten me on
something that'd be great but I also
just want to give any information in
case someone wants to join I'm going to
be using this bronzer from my palette
this is just laguna from mars i'm just
going to be putting that in the normal
places I feel like my bronzer and blush
and all that is pretty much the same
routine always just changing up the
product or the color okay
these little hairs are bothering me so
much it's hard to see I feel like I'm
really washed out and monitor so
hopefully I'm not in real life or in the
video for blush today I wanted to do
something kind of neutral this is
celebrated from Tarte I believe this is
limited edition but you could use
whatever this one is yeah like nudie but
has like a warm peach enos to it which I
thought would go well with the palette
it would like add enough but not take
away from the eye look for a highlighter
today I'm going in with the Lancome dual
finish highlighter this one is in
shimmering buff oh one I really like
this product I think it works really
nice I thought that'd be kind of fun for
a My Little Pony look I think that's
everything for the face we're moving on
to eyes but I need to go get liner so
I'll be right back for eyes I'm just
doing my like classic things so I have
my laura geller pencil for tightlining
it's just in brown I have a white for
the waterline and then for mascara I'm
using my Urban Decay perversion and then
I will be right back and move on to lips
I forgot about the inner corner so let's
do that I'm gonna use a setting spray
and I'm gonna go in with this lighter
blue this one here it's like a duochrome
I'm gonna spray the brush first you can
do it either way where you spray the
brush or you spray the brush after you
have product whatever works for you oh
yeah this is like a very cotton candy
look I feel like and I'm bringing that
on the lower lash line
I'm actually surprised how well this
showed up really like how that kind of
finished off the look if you want to
full-on review of this let me know I can
always do that for you guys as I use it
more I think I'm also actually going to
go in and just punch in a little bit
more pink I don't know on the lower
lashline I'm going to go in with a
smudge brush I'm also gonna bring a
little bit more on top so I'm gonna go
in with the darkest pink in here
really tap it off since we already have
our mascara on and our concealer is what
I meant to say and just kind of Pat that
in there for a little bit more intensity
oh I like it and then I'm still gonna go
back in and just make sure that peach is
really prominent over here and I think
just to tie everything together I'm
gonna go in with that first shade we use
and I'm going to tap it off because it's
really pigmented and just kind of go
underneath the brow bone and just kind
of highlight that area that's just kind
of like an interesting little touch that
look got pumped up in like two seconds
for lips I did pick up one of the lip
glosses from the collection
I'm with the more purple one this is the
color Ponyland I think the color
flutterby or Fluttershy I don't know
them are gold one I did want that one
but I don't know I just felt like this
was different more different and so this
is one I picked up so I'm just gonna put
that on my bare lips I wanted something
really simple I have tried this on one
other time the glitter is very very
prominent and when you take this off the
glitter just like kind of stays on your
lips which I personally kind of like
it's like a cool look but that might be
something that's a no-go for you I think
that's like a fun little touch I also
think like a warm nude would look really
nice kind of accenting the peach enos of
the eyes but you can do whatever you
want alright guys that is everything
thank you so so much for watching I am
going to be having a ton of videos
coming up I just have so much to film
I'm going to be having my Natasha de
Nonna let stupid palette I'm going to be
doing my actual review on that palette
