Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing another get ready with
me this one's a little bit different
because I'm gonna be going in with these
shadows from well they're not from hood
up beauty but they are my dupes for it
so that will be the next video I'm
filming so stay tuned to that if that's
something you want to see I'm also gonna
link this get ready with me in that
video as my demo I just wanted to talk
to you guys a little bit more I feel
like I haven't like connected in a
second so yeah I wanted to just like
have a chitchat already with me but I
also needed to film a demo for that
video so it's kind of like a two-in-one
but in the sense that there's two
different videos with the same
information I don't know anyway I hope
you guys enjoy that I still try to get
that demo up in one way or another
because I know you guys do enjoy that
let's just get started I'm first gonna
prime my eyes I'm using my Maybelline
primer I'm sorry and have a video up
yesterday I'm filming this on Tuesday
and hopefully we'll get this up Tuesday
night fingers crossed it just didn't
work out I was doing such a good job of
everyday uploading and I know a lot of
you guys enjoy it and I just enjoy you
know I have so many ideas and I enjoy
uploading to YouTube so I tried a daily
upload as much as I possibly can for you
guys and for myself so I'm sorry if you
were looking forward to yesterday's
video and didn't get one but we should
be back on track for at least a little
bit I'm gonna film I think of four
videos today I had a question about if
I'm in like pre film and I always pre
film my videos I usually try to film
like three videos every time I sit down
to film just because I don't have the
time every single day to sit down and
set up all the lights and do that and I
might as well knock out a few different
ideas at once I'm gonna do my eyebrows
I'm using my ELF eyebrow pencil and I
did find my color pot pencil so I'll
also be using that and I don't think I'm
gonna speed this up a look I'm like out
shoot I don't think I'm gonna speed this
part up so hopefully we won't be here
too too long I used to feel kind of like
nervous or just like weird about filming
and pre filming because I feel like so
many people I don't know like so many
large creators don't pre film or don't
really talk about it or act like it's a
than when they do that I felt weird that
I preferred pre-filming or like filming
multiple videos in one day is what I
mean but that's what works with my
schedule and I feel like to me putting
out content is more important than when
I put it up or if I'm wearing the same
look and I'm not the type of person
that's necessarily gonna go like change
my outfit to make it look like it's a
different day like I don't have time for
that either
so yeah I hope you guys don't mind that
like I said I feel like more content is
just better than less content so it
works out I hope you guys had a great
weekend though I feel like I'm almost
always filming these chitchat get ready
with me on Mondays I feel like the last
one I filmed was also on a Monday again
I just want to say hi and welcome to all
the new subscribers I super appreciate
you guys being here the last time I
filmed to get ready with me I was
thinking new subscribers and saying how
awesome it was because I had grown quite
a bit from the makeup addiction video
and I know you guys are probably sick of
me talking about it but it's just
absolutely mind-blowing to grow so fast
and we're already at 13,000 now like I
don't understand but it's so awesome so
I just want to say thank you so much
and welcome I hope you guys like the
content well I'm doing a pretty good job
of my eyebrows even though I'm like
chit-chatting away here maybe that's the
secret maybe I do need to talk while I
do them and then you get them done
alright I feel pretty good with those
I'm not someone who really stresses too
much on the brows like I try to make
them as even as possible and depending
on the look I might like add more or
less but I'm feeling that last step for
the brows I'm gonna be putting a brow
gel through this is the Maybelline brow
precise I switch back and forth I really
love that land come one I've also been
using the black up and I've been
enjoying that as well I just like to
switch it up sometimes I feel like since
I can if I'm not painting something it's
kind of the fun way to switch up my
routine without changing too much I'm
also filming a makeup basket today
because I need to update you guys
just been kind of busy like this month
has been pretty slow but then this last
weekend if you follow me an Instagram
you saw that I went to solving I did a
wedding there I did five different
people it was a lot I'm just gonna set
my lid really fast using a loose powder
because I don't have a matte cream shade
in the palette that I created so this is
just gonna set that primer but I did
five people including the bride I did
the bride the bride's mom and then three
bridesmaids and it was just me I didn't
bring an assistant or anything and we
had to travel out of town because it was
in Seoul vein which is about two hours
north of LA it's a really cute little
town it's um it's a little Danish town
Dutch town I thought was the same I I'm
not trained to be ignorant I just really
don't know so first off okay I don't
know what I want to do quite yet I'm
probably gonna use some of the duo
crumbs or sparkly colors because I don't
know that's like the funnest part about
this so I'm going to be using this top
shape just to start a transition in my
crease something that I've been really
wanting to do and kind of explore it's
like a travel lifestyle vlog channel so
I want to really work on that but the
thing is I really want it to be higher
quality I mean I don't think I can get
it to super crazy high quality
especially at the beginning but I just
want it to be higher quality than like
some of the vlogs I've put up and I also
want it to be a better mix of like
actually informational and not just like
oh we're cute and this is a cool place
look how much fun we're having but more
like inspirational hopefully and
informational so that you would want to
go there or it would give information if
you were trying to look up about that
place so anyway we decided to do a vlog
day up there and actually try to put in
some time to get cool shots and give
like the tiniest bit of information most
of it is gonna be like over music and
just like cool shots of the town but I
have a lot of really cool ideas for that
channel now I think I already feel like
I don't know what I want to do I think
next I'm gonna go in with this peachy
pink color and I'm going to be put
into the outer portion of my eye and a
little bit lower than the crease color
just to build up some color we'll see
where this is going I'm not entirely
sure we decided to put it on our joint
channel which is called salmon stream
because Samm and Lauren equals salmon
and then we did a lot of movie review so
that's what we have on there at the
moment but um yeah I'm I really want to
try to just put up like just cool
content different content on there and I
realized that not everyone's gonna want
to see vlogs and stuff like that but I'm
so into travel and I'm very passionate I
think that travel can just like expand
your mind so much and give you so much
insight into the world and how other
people live and give you so much
compassion and empathy that it's just a
really important thing to me so plus
it's like fun like who doesn't want to
let go travel I'm gonna be layering
shadows today so we'll see how that goes
you're definitely gonna want some type
of spray I'm gonna be using this kiss
one you could definitely use just
anything you have even water would
technically be better than nothing so I
am going to be spraying my brush and I'm
going in with this shade up here it's
kind of like a rosy gold I will have
everything listed down below shade wise
and again if you want to know what the
rest of the shades are even if I don't
use them I would check out the hooter
palette dupes which will be coming up
tomorrow can we see it I'm gonna go in
with my finger and try that you might
have wanted to put like a base down I'm
not sure I think this palettes so pretty
I just I've been into something a little
bit simpler in the last couple days so
yeah trying to figure out what I'm doing
is kind of hard next I want to start
bringing in some of those purples so I'm
gonna be going in with this color here
and just blending that into the outer
corner I am really excited to edit that
walk together and kind of see how it
comes how it comes together because
vlogging is definitely difficult and
it's something that you really have to
either have someone else who's vlogging
you or that you really have to think
about because the shots that are really
the best usually you're too busy like
living that
to record it or it's just kind of weird
like you know shoving your camera in
someone's face to get a clip of
something so that you can instead of
telling your audience about it verbally
you can show them like they're there and
I'm excited to edit out that footage to
really learn I feel like with vlogging
like doing is learning and so the more
you do the more you understand like oh I
need this type of clip Oh next time I
want to think about this or whatever so
it's gonna be our first kind of like
actual attempt at that and I'm really
excited I really want to do some stuff
of like different food places here in LA
kind of share a whole different side of
my life besides beauty over on that
channel so we'll see how that goes
there's no way I'm gonna be able to
upload as as often as I do on this
channel because I put so much work into
this channel but hopefully we can try to
get stuff up a couple times a month or
so at least at the beginning until you
know we kind of work on formatting and
stuff like that I'm kind of bringing
this in a little bit more than just in
the outer portion I really like the way
that's all looking so far I'm gonna go
back in with this orange shade wheeze in
the transition and just start blending
that out so anyway back to doing the
bride and stuff that was really fun
they're super nice and great but it was
a lot of work because I was working from
like 10:30 to 3 straight just doing
people's makeup so it was just a lot
there's a lot of work but it was fun I
really like being able to do a bunch of
different things like not just doing
stuff on set not just doing you know one
type of makeup because there's so much
out there and it's really fun being a
part of someone's a special day like
that I like being able to be there to
help celebrate and be a part of it and
help them feel really beautiful on their
wedding day like it's such a fun cool
thing to be able to do and that's such a
different experience than doing
someone's makeup for set when maybe the
actress is really used to getting their
makeup done or their a character that
they're not normally so maybe they're
the mom so it's a very simple makeup
instead of something more glam or
something that's really gonna make them
feel beautiful maybe they're supposed to
be like a haggard
old woman or something you know anyway
um what to do next
okay I'm gonna be going in with the
shadow that I am using to dupe the
pallet but it's not in a pan form quite
like that this is the color solstice
from Urban Decay I am going in with my
finger and I'm going to be patting that
over top of the color we already put
down and I'm hoping this will just give
it a really cool sheen of some sort I
don't even know it has a lot of glitter
to it so beware but it is very very
beautiful I also suggest definitely
doing your eyes at first which is why I
did my eyes first you will be happy that
you did I'm probably gonna go on top of
that but I want to deepen out the outer
corner just a little bit more for that
I'm gonna first go in with this shimmery
shade from makeup geek and just Pat that
on the outer corner I know I'm like
turned away more for this just because
I'm looking in the mirror so hopefully
that's not distracting and then I'm also
gonna go into this color I think that's
going steady from colour-pop which is
part of like my bonus shades and just
also adding that and we're going back
out to blend everything I'm kind of
mixing the peach and the like pink or
peach I decided I did need like a base
or something just to let these shadows
stick that are gonna be on the lid I'm
just going over the colors that I
already put down I'm gonna Pat out with
my finger but while it's still kind of
like creamy we're going in with the
urban decay shadow this is real life I
don't know how I'm feeling about this
I like the glitter is so pretty but I
don't know man I don't know I always
feel like I think this though before I
put on face makeup I was a little bit
messy so I feel like you can see some of
that glitter into my crease but I think
this will be pretty once we get the rest
of the eye on and I'm gonna clean up
under my eyes with a wet wipe something
I need to tell you guys there was an
earthquake last night that was insane
I have never been through an earthquake
I don't really think before like I kind
of think there was there's been some
since I've lived here in California but
I cannot ever remember really feeling
one like I did last night and so that
was kind of scary
it was a little before 11:30 when it
happened I was like a bit watching you
too
and Sam was out editing because he's
been putting up a vlog a day on his
channel and I I was like did Sam just
come in here because it sounded like he
had jumped on the bed and then I
realized that oh no this is an
earthquake so I like yelled out Sam's
name and he's like yeah you know because
he's super like prepared for stuff like
I think I've talked about this before
but for Christmas he wants like paracord
and like life straws and stuff like that
like he likes being prepared and so he's
been telling me over and over like
prepare for the big earthquake the big
earthquake so I was like I was so scared
like in that moment it was like holy
crap this is everything Sam's ever said
and so I was like you know I sleep naked
so anyway I'm just trying to get dressed
cuz I'm just like you know totally
vulnerable I was like starting to cry
and he like had come in there at this
point was like you know like grab this
try to have shoes whatever because we
didn't know like how long it's gonna
last like if there's gonna be more or
you know you just don't know if there's
gonna be like aftershocks or whatever
lovely there weren't so that was good
but yeah that was definitely a scary
moment I'm gonna be mixing two primers
this is the coverfx primer it's the
blurring one and I just put a little bit
of that where my pores are because my
pores are pretty massive we have this
really big sturdy table so that's where
we've planned to like go under so I was
just sitting kind of oh well I'm did go
under it like immediately cuz I was like
so scared but then I just chilled out by
it and then eventually I was like I say
I'm going back to bed it makes you
definitely want to be prepared and have
like food and water and just different
things to like in case anything did
happen you could at least be okay for a
second you know I think that earthquake
was only like a 3.7 so it wasn't too bad
but I mean I felt the bed moon right
like I said it felt like Sam jumped on
the bed and I was like trying to figure
out what's going on like how did I not
see him come in the room so it was
definitely like just frightening for a
moment cuz you know you just all these
things and all these emotions flash
before your eyes and you just try to
like stay calm and figure things out but
you don't know what things are gonna be
so I feel for people definitely in the
her
Cheng's - you know natural disasters are
just scary you have no control over it
you know what's happening and all these
things that you feel like you normally
have control over like you just don't
maybe that's a little earthquake story
and I want to say aura was just so sweet
if you don't know her or her channel I
will leave that link down below for you
to check her out but she contacted me on
Instagram and was like are you okay like
I heard there was an earthquake so I
just so sweet and you know the mooring
on youtube it's like I can't believe the
type of relationships that I have with
people that I've never met in real life
but I do consider that my friends and
you know that there's just it's just
such an awesome network and relationship
that I've made with people and it's just
so cool that YouTube's been able to give
me that and it makes me feel really
special and appreciated and I appreciate
all of you guys for all the comments and
all of that as well it's just it's like
a mind blowing when I think about it I'm
gonna be using this new foundation from
fenty beauty I'm gonna have a hall
coming up soon I haven't like done an
official haul in like about two months
or so since my Sephora and I just did a
woe haul in retrospect this is a shade
150 and I just got this from a Sephora
order I was really excited for the
Rihanna stuff and once it dropped like
what everything was gonna be I don't
know I just felt like like the
foundation is okay
it's just not my style at the moment
like I don't want to think super matte I
do like something that's more of like a
demi matte or a natural skin finish or
even something that is more glowy I'm
happy to get this small sample though
and try it out because it is always fun
I did pick up one thing the lip gloss
and I'm excited for that but that was
really the only thing I felt like really
fit me and that's part of my attitude of
panning it's like I want to support
Rihanna and I think it's so amazing that
she has all this stuff but if it doesn't
seem like it's gonna work for my
preferences it's a waste for me to get
it I didn't get any of the matchsticks I
didn't get any of
anything else I've heard a lot of good
and bad things I think it's great that
she came out with so many shade ranges
on her first initial launch I think
that's amazing and I'm happy that you
know I feel like a lot of people have
received it really well and I'm really
happy that they really like what they've
gotten you know I'm excited to see what
else she comes out with though to
hopefully find some stuff that will
become staples in my collection and that
I'll actually use and love but the other
like the highlighters I'm just not super
into highlighter so I didn't want to
pick those up either I mean a lot of
people really like them but a lot of
people have said that they're like kind
of chunky or whatever and that really
isn't my style so anyway this is the
foundation
I feel like this color match is pretty
nice for where I am right now I do feel
like it drives down a little bit deeper
than when I originally put it on but
nothing too much I have worn this one
other time and I liked it but I just
felt it felt a little heavy at the end
of the day so I'm excited to try it out
again and kind of get a better idea of
what I think of it oh my gosh I dropped
a bunch of foundation like all over my
pants and I didn't realize it I thought
that it went somewhere and I looked all
over my shirt and I didn't see it
because it was on the pants and it's
also on the floor cool story bro cool
story moving on I'm gonna do some
concealer today I'm actually gonna
correct my under eyes a little bit I'm
just using a little bit of this is this
from the brand YBF I have these in my
kit for a while but I just never ended
up really using them too much if I'm
gonna color correct
I'm usually needing to actually color
Kirke like it's a serious situation I
don't always color correct cuz I like to
keep the under eye really nice and
natural if I can so this one although
the texture is really nice and thin I
feel like it's it's just not for my kit
but I want to try to use it in my
everyday kind of get some use out of it
I'm going a little bit more full
coverage today obvi just because of the
eye look and everything I find that a
really colorful eye tends to look nice
with more makeup on the face so you have
less tonal variation to distract from
how pretty your eye makeup is anyway
back to what I was saying I am going to
be doing
a kind of like collective haul again if
you follow me on Instagram you know that
I picked up d it's the it's the Lila
palette I believe that's how you
pronounce it Jesus I have to think about
it so hard guys I did pick that up from
Natasha to Nonna and so I will be doing
like a review and demo and I'll probably
do a let's do pit on it so I just kind
of want to show you guys what's coming
up on my channel through the hall it'd
be great to get your as feedback of like
what you actually want to see and yeah I
just have a lot of like new cool stuff
so I want to show you it and get your
has opinions and not something to I
don't want anyone to be like upset that
I'm hauling stuff or anything this
channel is about balance so yeah I do my
makeup
I still love makeup I just don't buy
everything you know I didn't buy
anything from the Too Faced collection I
didn't buy anything from well the two of
the Too Faced collections or not much
holiday stuff like I tried to just be
more balanced with what I do but I
thought that doesn't mean that I'm not
going to buy anything ever so if that's
gonna trigger you just don't watch that
video I'm liking it I will say with the
Rihanna foundation it does dry down like
my face feels nice and matte and it's
kind of nice that you wouldn't need to
set this if you didn't want to I'm gonna
try that I think maybe not today
I might just trying to like lightly set
it but I am gonna try that where I don't
really set it too much just to see kind
of how it performs to set my face I'm
gonna be using this powder from Kat Von
D I'm doing so when I finish their team
by Halloween guys it's crazy I finished
up so many good things I cannot wait to
do an update on that I'm feeling like
really awesome about it and it feels
good to like when you bring new stuff in
that you're actually getting stuff out
feels good I'm mostly setting where I
put any of that concealer and then I'm
going to just lightly lightly kind of
sweep this across the rest of the face I
am like just feeling this eye look now I
hope in person you can see like that
glitter just changes to like it gives us
like this greeny blue shift it's so so
pretty I have decided I'm not going to
be buying the hooda palette I'm also
gonna be doing an anti haul today so you
guys will see that later but let's move
on let's keep this
train going we're getting close guys I'm
gonna put some bronzer on this is the
hula light bronzer and I like to put it
up on my temples because I'm like losing
all my hair there I like to just gently
bring this into the hollows of the cheek
a little bit just to bring back some
dimension to the face oh another thing I
wanted to bring up I I just want to say
thank you for all of the lovely comments
on my last tube chalk video I don't know
why I was so nervous to upload that and
I was like telling saying like a million
times like I'm nervous I'm nervous he's
like okay just do it like you know as
much as I like talking about you know I
love the tube talks and I'm so glad so
many of you guys are liking the tube
talks to you because I I just think it's
fun to discuss things and you know I try
to be a little bit more fair about it I
try to have a little bit more
understanding hopefully at the other
side and I really do want like a
discussion but it's also YouTube in the
internet so it can just you know it you
don't have that back and forth
necessarily to really discuss something
and that's what it's difficult for blush
I'm using this one from Eden minerals
it's like a peach but it does have
almost like this purple reflex in it
like the tiniest bit so I thought it
would look nice with like the warm and
the purple I just get nervous and I I
knew you guys would understand me and
I'm trying hard to like you know not
care what people think regardless but
that's easier said than done and that's
what I kind of touched on on that I
didn't even talk about in that video
constructive criticism though and that
is something I think is important this
is just a highlighter from bareMinerals
in the love affair this specific one I
think was limited edition but I do think
you can get this if you want it I think
it's like split pan with something else
I do you think constructive criticism is
something that as creators we can
probably be a lot better at taking I try
really hard to take comments that are
more like just not positive not that
they're negative they're just you know
like hey the Lighting's not that great
it'd be better if it was better or
things like that you know but I will say
on the creator side there's just as like
you know when you put yourself out there
even though it's like yeah I get that
not all positive continuity positive it
still can like
sting and there still is this just
knee-jerk reaction to be like like
that's mean all right you know like it
doesn't feel good here's someone to be
like hey this wasn't that good at
whatever and I think that's definitely
something that creators can grow from
and I also think if you get a lot of
hate and then you also get some of those
comments I just can feel attacking you
know it's just over overwhelming and
overboard so I think that maybe can be
part of the reason why but I definitely
think that some creators should you know
take the time from comments and maybe
reflect a little bit on themselves and
like you know have some inner reflection
and see if it's a valid complaint or if
it's not I'm just kind of blending out
this little edge because I feel like it
got kind of wonky from adding all the
concealer and stuff it's the spam again
guys
hello so anyway I totally see that
though from a commentary side it's like
not every comment needs to be like
positive and I think especially if
you're asking like let me know or if
you're saying things like telling people
to interact with you in the comments
that you should maybe expect a little
bit of that and try your best to get rid
of those initial feelings of like
insecurity and negativity from it and
try to look at it in the best way that
you can and try to just learn from it
and grow from it but then once again I
can see it too being like it seems like
a one-on-one relationship with you and
the Creator but for the Creator
everyone's commenting you know what I
mean and it's so hard to tell people's
intentions and tone over a text you know
what I mean like you have no idea if
they mean it sarcastically or real or
whatever I'm tight lining at the moment
this probably looks really disgusting
and sorry about that guys I was gonna
run a little bit on the lower lash line
anyway enough about that I was just you
know I'm glad I posted it and like went
through with it and I'm glad a lot of
you guys liked it as always I'm going to
be putting my white eyeliner on just to
keep this lip nice and bright look at
this little thing it's like a double
horn that's better right okay for the
lower lash line I'm gonna go in with the
peach first and start building up the
same kind of shades we have going on in
the crease I'm now going in
the peachy pink shade I just want to
bring some more of the warmth in before
I go in with the purples and it's okay
to kind of blow it out maybe a little
bit lower than you normally would now
for the purple I'm gonna go in a little
bit closer and a little bit tighter to
add some of that purple and I'm keeping
it on the outer half and I'm gonna go in
with even more purple I feel like those
look pretty even I'm pretty happy with
it it's hard to tell out here sometimes
so if my eyeshadow ever looks monkey
that's usually why it's cuz I'm just
like getting ready in my living room
for inner corner I'm gonna keep it
sparkly I'm going in with this liner
from hard candy I talked about this in
my fall feels tagged um use this at your
own risk it's definitely not the best
glitter liner out there but it's what I
have I'm gonna go in and put some
mascara on I'm using my perversion from
Urban Decay this one of my favorites
alright so that is the eyes down I'm
gonna add a little bit more blush
because you know you can never have too
much blush unless for this look we're
gonna put some lips on this is the buxom
badali and lip pencil well lipstick this
is just one of my favorite colors it
goes with everything easy simple alright
that is the final look guys and I really
hope you enjoyed this video and I hope
this gave you some inspiration if you do
have the hooded palette if you did
decide to buy it I know a lot of you
guys are really wanting it it looks
absolutely beautiful and I think you had
something really similar to this for
some of those go crumbs and glitter
shades and whatnot and if not hopefully
it will inspire you to like go through
your collection see if you have any
shadows that you can make something
similar to this without that palette
thank you so much for watching I
appreciate you guys so much and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
