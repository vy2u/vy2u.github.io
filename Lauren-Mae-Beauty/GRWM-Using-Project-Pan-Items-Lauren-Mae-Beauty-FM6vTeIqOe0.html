definitely not the daytime it's
nighttime stands at the gym and I just
wanted to get ready I'm going to Arizona

below I had some questions in my makeup
addiction video and that's what these
were so anyway today is get ready with
me is all gonna be about project
painting stuff so I'm gonna try so so
hard to actually just like get ready and
tell you a little bit of our products
but really not much cuz I just want to
talk to you guys I've used my get ready
with me as a wage like it's like a
bulletin board like you're in Starbucks
and you kind of check out your community
and oh this is happening this weekend
and blah blah a little update here
that's what I use these for I just don't
like to talk and tell you what's going
on and ask you guys questions and I can
read in the comments and whatnot
so let's actually start our makeup yeah
the first thing that I forgot is
literally my foundation creamer so why I
try to be so prepared and I'm not I just
hurt my toe really really bad we're off
to an amazing start an amazing start
okay let's start off with primer this is
the hard candy shirt and a primer first
off I wanted to say thank you again to
all the new subscribers hi welcome I'm
so happy to have you here I know a lot
of you guys came from Tina which is so
awesome um if you guys don't know about
the fancy face definitely go check her
out only for channel linked and then I
know a lot of people came from Lisa
Stevens as well so thank you so much to
those ladies her shouting me out I
really appreciate it and it's really
cool to see larger channels like
recognize you I know who you are that's
like super weird and super awesome so
yeah we're girl and guys fourteen
thousand so excited I feel like I'm
always talking and welcoming new people
and I'm not tired of it
so I hope you guys aren't either we're
using the vivillon cream foundation
today
just a buffing brush I even wrote a list
honestly so I didn't forget anything
first off deck of Scarlett contacted me
and wanted to know if I wanted to review
one of their pallets and I kind of
wanted to ask you guys if you wanted to
see a review of it like if you want to
see a review I'll do it um I'm not sure
how I I don't know I don't want to go
into a bias if you guys do want me to do
it but I don't know I it seems like an
interesting concept but I mean I don't
know if I've ever subscribed to it so I
don't know let me know if you want me to
review it or not depending on what you
guys say is what my decision will be I
mean some of the color concepts are cool
and I like that you get everything in
one palette but then part of me of like
you know like I said I'm going to
Arizona this weekend we just kind of
planned it
I feel like October is gonna fill up
really fast with like Halloween makeups
and just different things and I don't
want to like turn down work to go back
home so since we're both free this
weekend we thought it would be just a
good time to head home and see people
and I don't know we're not gonna be
there really long honestly but it will
be good still to get ready for the road
trip I took the car into the dealership
today which I'm sorry if any of you guys
work at a dealership but literally they
are swine's and I hate them so much I
hate everyone that dealerships we've had
just like we bought a car from a
dealership that's the first time in our
lives our first car it's on our first
car we usually get them off Craigslist
and do a whole cash deal and whatnot but
we decided to go a little more legit I
guess you could say with this car and we
also just didn't have like a ton of cash
to buy another car and I just I just
feel like they are horrible people and
Sam explained it really well he said
they have no matter how much time you
have they have more tactics to waste
your time and not let you get anything
done and not let you get what you want
done and they will say anything to your
face
never act on it we've just had really
bad experiences and I hope I hope that
your experiences are different than ours
because my goodness
it is so insane but um yeah I have not
had a good time and so we have to do
like our 60,000 mile bagel checkup and I
wanted to get that done before we left
on this trip so that you know we're
trying to be good car owners I'm gonna
go in with a corrector first under my
eyes this is the YBF one and it's in the
color neutralizing nude I'm just gonna
put a little at the darkest point so I
did that this morning and I was planning
on filming right after that but it just
didn't work out I don't know why I just
did it so I'm getting ready for I don't
know taking this off I'm getting ready
to fill my other videos that's what
we're getting ready for anyway so what
have you guys been up to I have been
trying to stay busy I've had a little
bit of work lately which is been nice I
did a book trailer yesterday and that
was really fun it's always fun doing
those because they're a little bit more
dramatic than a lot of the other stuff
that I do and so since they're just like
90 seconds and all just like images and
feelings and music you can do just like
more fun stuff I feel like in like
natural movie makeup I've done three
book trailers now so I really want to
see what they look like if you've been
on my Instagram there's a picture was
like orange and purple smoke and that
was one of the book trailers as well so
yeah I just did that yesterday I also
recently went karaoking for someone's
birthday Amy who directed the unnatural
film um so that was really fun I've
never been karaoke I'm gonna actually
input a whole clip of it here so
sorry for that horrible singing but it
was super-funny why don't you guys to
know because it's like Asian style
karaoke which is different it's like
little rooms okay
it kind of is creepy because they look
kind of devious like it looks a little
seedy almost if you've ever watched the
movie taken like imagery there but it's
really fun and we had a really good time
and then we went out to I went to like a
club club like a real Club and you had
to get like invited out sir and we
wanted this elevator which is like
totally not my style totally um but that
was kind of interesting definitely
Hollywood experience we weren't there
long we were at a different place like a
little dive bar and then we went to that
Club for like a little bit that was
definitely interesting and then we got
tacos because hello tacos I'm using my
Revlon powder for my finish 13 by
Halloween a lot of this stuff is from
that project I will be doing an update
on that today I'll do a couple updates
and then I'm doing a new Beauty launches
so that's kind of oh my gosh I didn't
blend out what was on my nose hello or
my gym like once again thanks for all
the love on my last couple of videos I
appreciate it I'm glad you guys like it
um you know as much as I know I would
love it like I really hard to put up
content that I would want to click on in
my subscription feed so I'm glad that
you guys enjoy it and yeah makes me
happy a few things coming up and I just
kind of wanted to get your guys's
opinions on I am gonna do a fall haul a
company reached out to me called Rose
gal I had never heard of this company
before but they sell plus-sized clothing
as well as regular size clothing it's
kind of fashion no but II but if you
guys can't tell like I literally have
the exact same clothes like I have like
five shirts I wear so they said that I
could like shop on their site and I'm
going to do a haul and I'm also going to
do like a try on haul and I hope that it
will be helpful and I hope you guys
don't mind
actually we'll enjoy it I also wanted to
see if this stuff was like actually good
it's from a site that I feel like I
would be definitely tempted to buy from
if not I would probably buy from but I'd
be scared of like the quality and the
sizing because I know sizing can be so
hard especially for plus-size and what I
liked about this is that everything is
affordable and I'm an affordable girl
like okay like things to be just less
expensive if they can be especially when
it comes to clothes so I really really
hope that the clothes are good and I
also got some new clothes out of it like
I'm so excited because I really need
clothes like I have a Ramon shirt that's
like at least five years old like if it
was makeup I went to clutter it oh yeah
that's so a perk of having a youtube
channel it's like hopefully I can get my
clothes and hopefully they're actually
good and if they are good hopefully you
guys will know about it my nose was
looking funky what anyway hopefully you
guys will then know about it and if it's
not at least we'll know that it's not
good so we'll see how that goes let me
know if you've tried Rose Gale stuff at
all I would let you know I don't know
what I just did to my nose like my nose
literally looks like I broke it cool I'm
just gonna try to cover that with some
concealer with some I mean a lot so
that's coming up yeah I don't really
talk much about clothes on my channel
and I also don't talk much about being
plus-size so I know I will be
introducing like two whole new things so
I hope you guys don't mind and maybe we
can do it a little bit more often I know
somebody that is plus-size it can be
difficult to find clothing and it kind
of sucks because I feel like I know I'm
just going over my powder but like I
still like my eyes are really dark maybe
it's just the lighting but also I don't
think so anyway being plus-size it's
like I don't let it be something that
defines me so it's not something I just
always address like oh I'm a plus-size
like I'm I don't want to say fat because
I know it offends a lot of people but
you know like aback I think you should
love yourself but I also think being
healthy is important and a lot of the
times being overweight isn't necessary
healthy so I don't know anyway it's not
something that I I don't want that to
define me or my channel but I think it
would be cool if you were looking for
stuff if it can help people I think
that's awesome plus again I can have
clothes that are you know not seven
years old it could just be that I have
some pimples here too I don't know guys
I do not know what's going on with my
nose we're just gonna hope that
highlighter hide set I don't even know
me the other thing I want to talk about
cuz I don't really want to get too deep
into that because it's a whole topic I
do have the Natasha de Nonna
Lila palette I'm gonna be using it today
just in my get ready with me as part of
me testing it and I know you guys want
to review on it and I'm trying to get
that up and I know you guys want to let
stupid on it which I'm also trying to
get up but I just want some time with it
so that way I can give you guys a really
good review for me specifically that is
just not an easy palette 2 review too
because it is so expensive I feel like
there's just there's a lot to it you
know you got to really figure that one
out and so I don't want to give out a
review too early and I really want to do
quite a few looks of it so my blush is
pretty intense day I don't even know
what this makeup is my goodness I'm
using my starlooks
eyes shadow as a highlighter I'm also
going in with another highlighter this
is the Kat Von D Alchemist and this is
also in my finish 31 Halloween and I'm
using the pink shade because I am gonna
be using the pink from the Lila palette
I haven't not used that yet so I'm
excited to really try that out I know is
it landgrave the island okay I feel like
this makeup is just turning to if I
can be so bold I totally moved the
lighting so hopefully that helps let's
get to eyes Oh eyebrows first eyebrows
I'm just gonna speed through these so
I'll see you in a second all right
brows wrong I also prime my lips so
let's set that with a cream eyeshadow
I'm going to be going into my Modern
Renaissance as well as the Leela palette
a little bit of a spoiler on that
palette um for me it is a not standalone
I definitely need some like more crease
shades it obviously doesn't have a cream
matte cream which okay I love wooden
palettes habit but I also get like I
don't need one in every palette because
I can use them and I already have
so it's like that one it's not like a
deal breaker for me it just makes me
have to use something else you know
anyway I will need a transition so I'm
gonna be going in again with this
palette and I'm going into burnt orange
it's one of my favorites
I have already hit pan on that and I'm
just going to be buffing that into the
crease like I do I will do it get ready
with me I think my next one will be kind
of like redo of that kind of like really
pink flushed look with the pink and the
brows a lot of people really like that
look so um I got a couple requests to
film it so I might just film that for
you guys you can see it and then I can
also refer people back to it if they
ever want to see how I do the brow a
thing even though I do have quite a few
videos if you go back you can see in
some other video how i do that i just
love this palette so good and i love the
shades in it like I could just do this
put mascara on and go you know I can do
something so simple or I can do like a
full-on pink smokey eye if I wanted for
this look we're going in with Lila and
we are gonna be going in with the pink
shade the hot pink shade I am filming
out for looks one palette I might even
do more than four looks depending on how
many looks I do and actually film but
I'm gonna using the shade magnetic is
what it's called and I'm gonna just be
putting this in my outer portion of my
eye probably like halfway almost yeah
and I'm just using a fluffy brush I'm so
excited I really have only kind of dug
into this pink not too much I normally
would do my eyeshadow first maybe you
know you know I really wouldn't I always
do my face makeup first so I only do
what if I do dark colors not necessarily
bright colors or Pink's so I guess we'll
see how much fallout there is this will
be the test and I kind of want it more
diffused so that's why I'm using a
fluffy brush but I mean the pigmentation
is still ins pretty intense so something
I want to talk about is the let's dip it
series and I know a lot of you guys want
me to do a lot stupid on this but if I'm
being honest I went through and I did
find some shades that would be similar
but I'm telling you like it would be an
entirely like inspired by because
they're not dupes like they're not I
don't have any colors like these colors
in my collection I'm not quite like
especially if we just watch them next to
each other these definitely have a
different factor
to them whether it's in the sparkle or
something like they definitely are
unique you know what I mean
so I don't know if you still want me to
do it I will do it you know I just want
you guys to know that like it's not
gonna be exact dupes so much of me wants
to just like take it all the way in but
I'm not going to stay strong Lauren stay
strong I feel like this is kind of like
that last look I did though and then
that's also the thing I know I've seen a
lot of people say you want me to do the
electric palette but like I just don't
have shades like the electric palette
except for the electric palette and I
don't necessarily want to buy shades to
dupit like I'm not if I had a lot of
subscribers it would be something I
would potentially think about but since
you know I'm it's this isn't my
full-time job and I don't have like a
ton of money and my channel is about
like you know not having necessarily the
largest collection at the moment it just
doesn't make sense to me to buy things
specifically to dupe something so again
I could do something similar but like
honestly with that one I really can't
it's just like its own thing I took some
mac fix+ I put it on a brush and I'm
just gonna put this on the inner like
3rd and just kind of fade it into the
thing now I'm gonna go back in with
burnt orange and I'm just gonna kind of
blend out that pink and try to kind of
soften the edge I'm gonna go back in
with the pink and kind of stamp it on
the outer edge I'm my deepen it I don't
know I don't want to ruin it because I
do really like it right now and I'm
scared maybe I'd like winged liner what
do you guys think I don't normally do
winged liner but I think that could be
pretty badass and I also think it'll
kind of make it at least a little bit
different from the last look I did I
think it's funny that most people do
like neutral looks all the time like
Here I am just always you're into pink
looks
I'm just taking burnt orange and really
blending it in this inner corner so it
doesn't look like it just ended and I
kind of I do like taking shadow up kind
of high here not like into the brow but
just like you know like this edge just
looks so good
this edge looks crazy I did have a bit
of pink fallout it's nothing like too
intense to me but it definitely happened
and I didn't even sweep it away I
literally just move it what should we do
for underneath maybe maybe we'll do
purple underneath that sounds fun I'm
gonna take the actually the deeper
purple the first one the first one the
middle one and I'm just going to start
smudging that out on the lower lash line
and then I'll probably blend this out
with that other purple and I'm kind of
blending this up into that kind of wing
we created as you guys can tell I did
end up doing liner I did it off screen
because it's like we're in a
life-or-death situation here this look
is already turning like crazy and I just
could not risk it going bad not even
sure if it went right still but you know
we have to move on we still have the
whole nose debacle I mean seriously guys
it's I don't have you controlling camera
by like it close it's looking scary I'm
in a tight line with this laura geller
it's just a brown it's like essential
for me to tightline when I do like any
type of liner like this because I'm so
fair you can see like like right here
you can see that skin also Sam it's home
from the gym so if you hear anything it
is Samuel I my tight line done I'm gonna
go into my waterline with this white
Kohl
just to keep it nice and bright and I
don't really want to deepen up my lash
line any more
I was thinking about it right now but
then I decided not to I do want to go in
and put something on my inner corner I'm
gonna go with the gold I think from this
palette I think that would just be
really pretty so I'm gonna go in with
this gold I'm gonna lightly put it here
and kind of build it up if I don't think
it like that yeah I like that
okay I just think gold and purple looks
so pretty together it's like so royal
but then with the pink it also looks
good cuz it's nice and warm I really
like the top of the lid like I can see
myself doing that again I like the
purple on the bottom too because it's
just like a different take about like
for everyday
I could definitely see myself doing that
I'm gonna mascara myself this is the
perversion by Urban Decay for lips today
we're keeping it really simple this is
the by Thierry lip pencil in rose
contour again since I'm just trying to
use the project pan items why do I talk
when I'm doing my lip pillow and I'm
going in with rakubian from NARS I'm
also gonna go in with a little bit more
bronzer because I feel like I didn't put
too much on and then the whole nose
thing happened so I kind of like backed
away and I also might put on more
highlighter cuz I did touch up and add
some concealer under my eyes when I left
camera
sorry guys so far this is my favorite
look I've done with the Lila palette I
think this is really pretty
and I think like adding in that warm
transition just really helped pull this
together because just those other
transition colors they're not
transitions are just pretty dark on me
and I mean again I'll go into more
detail on that in a review but I hope
this look turned out okay I'm not sure I
feel about the liner not very good at it
it's something I don't practice everyday
as you guys know so it's not something
that is my strongest suit but I think it
looks okay it's something a little bit
more edgy for me and it it puts a
different take on the pink kind of let
me know about all the things I talked
about at the beginning of this video
down below I can't wait to hear what you
guys have to say and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
