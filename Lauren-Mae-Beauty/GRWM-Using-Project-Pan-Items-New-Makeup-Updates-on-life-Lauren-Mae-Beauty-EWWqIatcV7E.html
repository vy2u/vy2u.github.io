Lawrence thank you so much for watching

I'm going to be doing this like classic
style so I'm actually just going to be
getting ready with you guys talking
about stuff I'm using project pan items
as well as a few new items that I've
been sent and then other than that I'm
going to be catching you guys up on just
like what I've been doing and stuff like
that I even have a list to talk about
like what I want to talk about and other
things I'm filming today so I hope you
guys enjoy this video I'm going to try
hard not to dwell on like what I'm doing
on my face I will have everything listed
in the description box if you're
interested and want to check something
out I'm already sweating so this video
is off to an amazing start it is so hot
here I have moisturizer on my face and
eye cream that's it so we're going to
start off with a primer I'm doing at a
first aid beauty coconut primer or
whatever this is this isn't my finished
searching but halloween project pans
always that link jumbled if you haven't
seen the intro so first things I wanted
to talk about I need to say thank you to
all the new subscribers welcome to my
channel thank you for subscribing I hope
that you enjoy it and I hope that you
like being here
um yeah I just wanted to say thank you
I'm trying to have I'm almost at 7000
subscribers which is like really weird
to me it's so exciting I'm really really
excited but I think that like in my head
5000 subscribers is kind of like oh my
gosh like imagine 5000 and so to be at a
level of almost 7000 which is you know
so much more than five it's just really
incredible so thank you to all of you
who have decided to you know subscribe
and watch my videos I truly appreciate
it thank you for all the sweet comments
I appreciate it just so you know I've
been really busy lately not necessarily
with work which I'll get into because I
did have someone asked just like such a
lovely comment asking about you know
what I've been doing what I've been up
to besides the show and just different
things and I thought that was really
sweet so I wanted to talk about that a
little bit in case any of you guys were
wondering before we get into it I'm just
going to put my foundation on I've been
really loving this this is the vivillon
cream foundation it's in my 13 by
Holloway project as well I was trying to
use it up or at least half of it we'll
see how it goes but honestly since I've
been a little more tan I've been going
to the beach I went to a pool party
yesterday for fourth of July
like I'm
getting more Sun than ever before so I
definitely have a bit of a tan compared
to what I usually am and this foundation
is working out really really well so
I've just been loving it anyway I'm just
applying it with a buffing brush this
one is from RC cosmetics I got this from
Heather she sent this over to me anyway
I've been really busy I went to Vegas I
think I've talked about this I'm not
sure but I did go to Vegas for work and
then it turned into like a fun trip
afterwards so that was really awesome we
had one of our friends from Arizona
communites there so we had this awesome
suite in the Bellagio like it was in one
of the towers it was like up high how
like moving curtains it was just awesome
because we don't have to pay for it and
so we were just like living the pimp
life up in that suite and just got to
enjoy our time and we had a really
awesome view of the Bellagio fountains
if you guys follow me on Instagram
you've definitely seen pictures from our
view and stuff it was the best time I've
ever had in Vegas since I've ever gone
which a museum don't drink very often
we're just social drinkers we don't
really drink at home but it was just a
good time I like actually enjoyed myself
so that was really awesome then a little
bit after that my mom came into town
which was so awesome again if you follow
me on Instagram you saw that I posted a
picture of me and my mom it was just a
chill trip we didn't like spend a ton of
money we didn't go a ton of places but
we did go to the beach and Malibu we did
some hiking I do have some vlog footage
if you guys would like me to try to get
that up so you can see it I will try to
do that I know my mom loves the vlog I
know some of my friends who watch my
videos like the blogs as well so I like
to do it for that as anything like even
if you guys aren't as interested plus
it's like an awesome reminder of like a
time in your life that you can't get
back and it's all just like put into a
concise little video I don't know anyway
I might try to do that it'll just be
late I do not know how people daily vlog
so like I can know I need to pre report
so that was really fun I loved having
her in town she was here a whole week
which is a long time but it was nice it
was nice to just have multiple days so
we just could be chillin you know there
was no pressure on like hurrying and
doing stuff I feel like my sweat is
almost like making this foundation go on
a little strange
I guess that's what happens when your
face is all sweaty from setting up
lights and turning off fans you forgot
to turn off and trying to get ready to
film the thing that sucks is you can't
have the add-on when you're filming or
it sounds really horrible and you paid
it later on when you're editing I'm done
with foundation it's not necessarily
like full coverage I can definitely
still see some things but I just like
the way it evens out my skin I feel like
it looks really nice on the face a
really nice dewy finish on the skin I do
feel like it dries down enough yesterday
when I went to a pool party I didn't
even set this is powder and honestly
just for God because I had been doing
other things while getting ready and it
worked out really really nicely so you
don't have to set this with a powder I
usually do them but before we go in with
powders we're going to conceal a little
bit I'm going to be using this new
concealer I got from amazing cosmetics
now I've seen their concealers kind of
making the rounds on as PR and they
reached out to me and wanted to send me
in a concealer this is the color fair
and this is the just amazing concealer
you guys have probably heard about this
I believe this is their like best
selling item I think the packaging is
different though I remember it being
less a longer - this stuff is really
really potent you do not need a lot of
it I do like the shade range they have
quite a few shades they have um
different undertones and stuff so that
was really nice when I picked out my
shade I thought that was cool they sent
me a little card saying that would be
code with love you can save 20% off on
amazing cosmetics calm I will read that
information in the description if you
want to check it out it's not absolute
link or anything it's just for you guys
to save some money so far try it out a
couple times I do really like it I think
that it definitely has some crazy
coverage I just go straight in and I'm
going to start off with that much
because it's just it's crazy how strong
of a concealer this is this one has like
a little rubber tip at the end and
honestly I'm not gonna lie when I first
got this it was like ripping off because
I thought it was like something that
covered up the top but it has a hole in
it so don't do that
my sign I realized before oh shoot
that's way too much it's going to blend
it out with my concealer I'm just going
to blend out my concealer with my Beauty
Blender this is getting a little light
for me I think I was a little bit stupid
about that but I
feel like fair and concealer is usually
what works the best for me most of the
year so while I'm a little bit more tan
it might be a little bit more of a stark
concealer but I do really like it I
think the texture on this is really nice
as much as it's super pigmented I don't
find that it's really really thick it's
not like the it cosmetics one I've been
enjoying that I will definitely be using
this up I just think it's kind of pricey
if I remember correctly that's the like
to me kind of a downside but again it's
super pigmented and it probably will
last you a really long time back to
talking about stuff I hope you guys had
an awesome 4th of July it was yesterday
that's the pool party to keep talking
about I didn't go to like some like
crazy little party but I did text some
friends and be like what y'all do so I
just wanted to actually be social and
you know keep keep my connections with
people and do things with them outside
of just working especially because I
want to like have actual friends and I
recently like the people I've met
through AFI we got invited to a party
and it was really fun we had a good time
um it's funny cuz like we didn't even
see fireworks we just like hung out in
the daytime and then we came home and
watched The Handmaid's Tale which I am
obsessed with we finished it last night
it was so so good
Peggy from Mad Men I don't know her real
name I'm sorry it's like the main
actress in it it's really really good I
kind of want to read the book now
because it's in like Diary style which
is something I really like but I highly
recommend the show I think that it is so
good we watched it in like probably a
24-hour period this is where psycho and
I like to binge watch things like if you
guys are like this you could be my best
friend because I want some with you like
down to watch it like I'm not playing
around we're watching seven episodes
thank you know what I say oh let's binge
it I don't mean like two and a half
episodes in like we are into it we're on
the next one there's no question we have
to like look at each other and be like
another one you know laughs like no we
already know you know anyway I really
enjoyed that before the July was really
fun it's nice hanging out with friends
and I hope yours was just as one or more
fun if you guys thought fireworks as far
as like a little bit more fun than my
clothes okay I'm trying to beauty by the
sweat away from my face I'm going to go
set with powder so I'm going to be using
the bend nice fair translucent powder
under my eyes and kind of in my t-zone
just to kind of set that area a little
bit more and then for the rest of the
face I'm going to go in with the Revlon
nearly naked powder and just kind of
like make sure everything is just a
little bit more matte and going to stay
in place longer throughout the day so as
for like working job I feel like I've
been doing some stuff but it has been a
little bit slower you guys all know
about second Wives Club I'm really
hoping that we get a second season I'm
not sure I haven't heard any word I
don't know if we're going to get a
second season which makes me sad I
thought it was a really awesome show I
super enjoyed it and I felt like a lot
of other people enjoyed it too when I
look at the social media accounts and
how much everyone grew over the course
of the show being on I feel like it was
a crowd favorite I also worked on the
average show which the season finale
just happened on that too so I don't
know about that getting a second season
as well sometime just waiting on those
but I have been working on a Disney show
and I can talk about it because it did
get announced it's Polaris it's going to
be on the Disney XD Channel I believe
and that show kind of like have to do
with youtubers and gamers and stuff so
that was kind of cool strawberry 17 I
don't know if you guys know her only for
channeling tt1 check her out she is like
one of the main host on right so I did
her makeup quite a few times she's super
cool yeah so that was really cool to do
and to see me know to like when it comes
to Gig they're not like oh you're
working everyday on something it's like
literally when they need you so it's
sporadic and that makes it kind of hard
sometimes depending on like what I'm
doing or whatever to stay you know
positive I guess just because you just
never know like I could be like oh
nothing so far for the month and then
all of a sudden get a call and get like
three gigs and that's enough money for
me for a while so it's like just a
little tough so that was a fun show to
do something a little bit different
working with producers that I worked
with top which was also and hopefully
that should be going on here like this
month so I'm looking forward to see how
some of the show comes about because
it's definitely just so different than
the reality stuff because it was more
scripted
let's do eyebrows I'm going to do my
eyebrows really fast and then we can go
talk about more I just know that
I do my eyebrows will I talk we will be
here for freaking ever so I will do my
eyebrows be right back guys
my eyebrows are all on if you are
wondering what I use to do them I use
the colour-pop brow pencil in the color
dope to on the outer portion of my brow
I did use the elf brow pencil in taupe
just on the front portion on the bottom
here and then you guys know I love this
this is the Lancome
sourcils styler and this is just a
tinted brow gel and I like to use this
to kind of brush up the hairs in the
front and just give that unkempt brow
look I really like it I just have really
been enjoying that you guys know it's
one of my favorites I've talked about a
ton so that was my brow routine
I'm also priming my eyes using my
Maybelline primer so besides the Disney
show I did just do a pilot which is
really awesome it was someone I worked
with on a short film she wrote her own
pilot and produced it and wrote it and
acted in it and she had some really
awesome people working on it so I did
that while my mom was in town it was
just a two-day shoot but that was really
fun and really often just to meet a new
group of people because connections are
literally everything so you want to just
meet as many people as you can
oh my gosh I just realized my
fingernails look horrible
sorry about your life there like so long
and gross it will oh yeah that was a
really awesome pilot and I really loved
to that the whole like set was mostly
women it was just very awesome so for us
today I'm going to be using my pan that
powered because I have not been using
this palette that's why you haven't seen
an update I feel horrible so I'm just
going to be trying to get back into this
I've just been enjoying using my new
color pop shadows I've just been
enjoying other stuff and I haven't made
any progress so I just don't want to do
an update that's like it looks the same
so that's why you haven't seen that but
I still like these shades I just I'm not
I'm not inspired at the moment by them
and I want to keep my routine fun so
anyway I'm going to go Anna for the
crease we should I do I feel like I've
been so basic for the crease I'm going
to go in with Mac's kid I've been liking
more of a neutral eye I don't know why
but just something not quite as like
orangie warm which is funny because it
just
the color pop palette and although I
love it I think it's great I just feel
like I've been gravitating to just a
more neutral eye lately which is so
weird what else that I've been doing I
think I mean I know it sounds like I
haven't been doing anything because it
hasn't slowed but I have some things
like potentially in the works for
potentially a feature which would be
crazy and kind of cool we'll see if that
goes through and then also I have
reaching for that film I did just right
back in May if you guys don't know about
that I'll leave a link to the website
down below but I'm super excited to work
with a me again shoes at the pool party
that's who I like hung out with but I'm
excited to do research for that I'm
excited to see the finished product on
that it should be a good one so I kind I
want to keep it pretty simple today just
because I am going to be doing
potentially a more crazy lip option so
oh shoot that reminds me I wanted to I
forgot like at the beginning of this I
wanted to put this new Latoya LAN from
clearance I got this from octiline this
is the instant light lip comfort oil I
had never tried ellipsoidal before I got
this one and I thought that this was
going to be a lot thinner and more oily
and honestly this just feels like a not
so sticky gloss it's very very shiny on
the lips it looks blue but it doesn't
come off blue and one of the reasons I
want to try to sucide never trying a
little oil before is the fact that this
has like mint in it so I love mint this
definitely has a mint smell it's kind of
like a sweet mint so you know sweet mint
gum it's not like super sharp I think
this is an okay product they work
tonight I just don't think it's like
it's oil in the traditional sense it's
definitely filled with a cloth to me
the mint isn't too strong which is nice
for some people I wish it could be a
little bit stronger and also just like
actual mint like I wanted to smell like
mint leaves that's like one of my
favorite scents ever is just like
rubbing your hands on middlings and
smelling your hands it's also good so I
wanted it to be that but it's not it's
just a little bit more I don't want to
say artificial but just a different type
of them it's nice the mint also kind of
plumps the lip so I thought it'd be a
good like press type of product even
though usually I'll put like a lip
product on my lips before I work but it
kind of like plump the lips get them
ready for
your product at the end of your makeup I
don't know so that's why I feel about it
now we'll see as I use it more I don't
think it'd be good at night though
because of the mint I feel like I'd be
like it's tingling alternately back to
the eyes I think that I'm going to go
with a little bit I guess warmer on the
eyes like I know my crease is pretty
neutral because I think I'm going to be
doing a bluish type of lip and I don't
want to be super cool toned so I'm going
to take antique from Mac and I'm just
going to be putting this on the outer
edge to just bring again just some
warmth nothing too too much and also
deepen up that outer corner that's what
it looks like now I don't really want to
do too much with my lid so I'm just
going to put a little bit of makeup geek
shimma shimma which is right here and
I'm just going to run that a little bit
on the lid just to brighten it up don't
get me wrong this is like a nice shimmer
color it's just not going to be like a
metallic kind of look and again I just
want that brightness like that's just
simple to me I'm also going to go in and
do the bottom lash line with a little
bit of kid I don't want to make it too
dark
let's do face products I'm going to be
going in with this brush from Real
Techniques this is the pointed elf brush
I've really actually been liking this I
do have a whole first impression if you
want to check it out but I've really
been loving this the most for bronzer
I'm going to go in with my Milani
bronzer in sunset I thought it would
bring up something to you guys and I
want to know what your ideas opinions
are um I also don't want this to be as
controversial as I feel like it's going
to be because my mom is like freaked out
about it anyway have you guys ever heard
of the brand monk they do like kind of
like vaporizers like Eve Apes or
whatever but it's essential oils and
it's not like cigarettes or anything I
don't know why I just really want to try
it out I don't know it's kind of
accepted there like about $20 a piece
I've heard Nicky Murphy if you haven't
checked their King a lot I don't leave a
link down below but she talked about
these before and I know that she does
beep so I don't know I don't date for
anything but I just wanted to try them
out I'm a little bit more alternative
than y'all think I just don't know I
keep like trying to like read up on it
and see reviews and stuff I mean I'm
probably just going to end up doing it
but let me know if you've tried any of
them before and like what your thoughts
were again like I said I was looking
with different reviews and they
reviews and stuff and I don't know it's
funny to see what people think about
each flavor they have like an initial
line that's like essential oil and
supposed to make you feel a certain way
so there's like happy something else
sleeping I know and the way you want to
feel is just the name of it so that you
can just pick that blend of essential
oils and hopefully that will help like
calm you or whatever anyway those ones
seems like okay to me buy off any of the
sense that would really work for what I
wanted but they just came out with three
new ones not just I don't know when they
came out but there is a newer line of
like there's like an ocean of forest in
a mountain one and they're supposed to
be inspired by you know the ocean in the
forest in the mountains and those are
the ones I really want to try they just
sound really awesome I think the ocean
one is the one I'm gonna try the most
because it's citrus and lime and
tangerine or something it sounds really
awesome but forest sounds great - I love
like the sense of like fir trees and
stuff like that so they all seem really
cool I'm going to get one to start off
with which is go dance my nature because
I'm like an all-in type of person which
I kind of want to make a video a tube
top which I'm making another to talk
today anyway about like sales ventures
and how that doesn't make you a failure
just because I've been doing like that
personally lately and I don't know I'm
sure other people deal with that to
just have a place to talk about
something like that let me know if you'd
be interested
I used repertoire for my blush right now
for a highlighter I'm going to be using
my Kat Von D Alchemist I've been
enjoying this so much lately plus it's
in my project pan today I'm going to be
mixing two colors I'm going to be mixing
sapphire and Hampus because I want this
like blue purple look on the cheeks ooh
yeah I think it'll complement the list
without being too crazy but anyway if
you try the Hmong stuff let me know what
you think I think I'm going to do it but
I'm going to just buy through Amazon
like monks or Amazon even though it's a
little more expensive so that way I can
just get one and not a bunch of them I'm
also going to be putting this on my
inner corner of my eyes and do you like
that really bright inner corner that you
guys have been noticing that I love I
did this in my last video and really
liked it and you guys complimented me so
much so thank you
just think it's such a fun way to bring
color into your love without it being
too much like this is definitely not too
much it's still fun it's still something
and I'm always so shocked at how well
these duochrome show up even when there
is nothing I'm not putting out on a
black face I'm not putting out anything
these ones are looking like horns or
something so it's freaking me out I'm
going to try to blend that out I want to
go on with some lion eyes really pop I'm
going to be using my laura geller brown
sugar liner on my tight line I'm going
to be using the steel a white Kajal
liner on my lower lash line and to
finish up my eyes I'm going to be going
in with the even minerals or Volume
Mascara I've really been enjoying this
you guys know that I'm just trying to
finish it up I don't know what I want to
move on to next I'm thinking about Urban
Decay's perversion because it's one of
my favorites and I haven't had it in so
long I just want to like make sure it's
still something I love but if you have
any mascara do you think I might like
let me know down below so I can check
them out
highs are all done they're just simple
simple simple we're going to want to lip
now I will say there's like an inside
ring of crap I don't know if that's just
like my foundation like doing that I
took that that's sick so I'm just going
to be rubbing away most of the product
you could do this with not your fingers
but that's what I got I'm going to be
taking my colour-pop lippie pencil in
the color doesn't calls oh they are
filled with a pencil okay I'm going to
be taking it in the color Aquarius and
I'm just going to be whining and filling
my lips innocence this is similar to my
lip color and I just wanted a nice
defined lip before I go in with what I'm
going to use I don't know how I'm going
to do with them there's a new coven of
Quan actually they're not that new but I
did just get them through octa Lee so
I'm really excited to try them out I
have worn each of them one time just
like texting them out on my list but
this is what they look like this so cool
this is the molten lip in the color
cyber opal which is like the more pink
one and then they have the cyber sky and
that's the blue one and I want to use
the blue one because I feel like this
one is the most unwearable I guess you
could say pink is more like okay the
blue is like what's wrong with you girl
you guys know I
duochrome I love fun stuff a little bit
like different type of makeup so I was
really excited to get the chance to try
these out so cyber sky is super
pigmented the wand doe foot applicator
is also like a triangle with a divot for
your lip it's very interesting I feel
like it gives you really precise
application I really enjoyed that about
it and this is like so pigmented look at
that so I just want to put like a little
on I don't want it to be too crazy I
kind of just wanted to show a way that
you could wear cyber sky without it
being like insane I thought this is
going to turn out more blue than it is I
feel like it looks more like blue purple
on my lips by itself and it does over
this lip product for whatever reason is
a formulation wise I think these are
really nice they're a gloss and they're
a bit thicker but they're not sticky I
think they're really really cool
definitely not like an everyday wearable
or everyone's type of product that is
cyber opal the pink one this one
definitely looks more white on my lips
than pink but I think topped over
something else is be really cool I also
think you could use these in really fun
ways not like for necessarily super like
practical things but for a more fun work
you could use these as highlighters if
you like or even on the eye for a really
