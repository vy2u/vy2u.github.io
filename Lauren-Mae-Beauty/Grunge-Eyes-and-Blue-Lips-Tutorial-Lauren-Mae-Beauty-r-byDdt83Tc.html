Lauren thanks so much for watching today
is going to be a tutorial on this look
here I was wearing a version of this
look in my fam expo hall and I got a
couple requests to do a tutorial on it
so here it is I did do a few things
differently but it is ultimately the
exact same luck with the yellow and that
kind of yellow brown and then the blue
lips the entire inspiration behind this
was the blue lipstick I got this at
IMATS in January and I hadn't worn it
and I was like I'm wearing it so this is
the I look that I thought would
complement a blue lip really well it's
still funky they're still color on the
lid but I don't think it takes away from
the blue lip I think it really adds and
it's just a very grungy look I really
like it I hope you guys you too and if
you want to know how to get it then just
keep watching okay so let's get started
on this kind of yellow grungy I as you
can see i have already done my base
foundation and my eyebrows and
everything so if you want to know what I
used to do that it will all be linked
down below first things for the eyes i'm
going to be taking this fluffy brush
from sigma this is the e 40 and i'm
gonna be taking the shadow from makeup
geek called peach smoothie and I'm just
gonna be running that in my crease is
kind of like a transition color this is
quite light so it doesn't do a ton but
I'm still gonna use it mm-hmm and we're
just blending this out so that we
hopefully can have a really nice
seamless transition between all the
shades that we're going to be using look
at that not horrible oh so frustrating
when you have a breakout on your eyelid
how does that even happen someone tell
me now that we have that all blend you
got I'm going to go in with desert sands
and I'm gonna also buff this into my
transition and this is gonna go actually
all over the eyelid as well so you can
just get super messy with it this is
definitely going to give us that more
grungy look I really like it and you
don't want to bring it too far passes at
peach smoothie because then it kind of
defeats the purpose of that being the
transition color so keep it just
slightly lower than that one and once
there is less product on your brush you
can kind of then sweep it up I'm really
only using a couple brushes for this
look too i'm telling you this is really
simple it does not take much to do now
this is where I'm strong just a little
from what my original look was i'm going
to be taking the color tiki hut and i'm
going to be putting that at the base of
my lashes and a
a lower part of my lid and then we'll
blend this into desert sands I'm just
using the one side of this naked tube
brush it's like a flat synthetic side
I'm just going to pack that on we want
this look to be darkest at the lash line
and at the roots of the lashes I
basically put that on my I all the way
up until the crease and now I'm going to
go on with the other side of this brush
which is a blending brush but it's a
little bit smaller and I'm going to go
back in with desert sands and just buff
that line out and kind of meld the two
at the crease and then I'm going back in
with e 40 and just blending out the very
edges of this look so far I kind of
lined up the colors I'm using here on
the end but now I'm gonna go in and use
these yellow colors and then replacing
those right here you guys know how I
love to do that also if you take a look
at the fame expo hall video I'll leave
it linked down below you will see that
that is really where the yellow kind of
comes in I've really liked it and then I
kind of brought the yellow down here too
i really like having i'm down here and
like buffing the lower lash line out
with them but then having it up here
that's just how i like to do it so first
i'm going to be going in with coastal
scents orange mousse and this is like a
yellow like a lighter yellow color i'm
just going to be kind of bringing it up
from where we blended those shadows and
into the brow just blend it right into
your bro and I like to just kind of
bring it back a little bit but I like to
keep this free so I can still have that
highlighted brow bone now I'm going to
go with the slightly darker color this
is cantaloupe size from coastal scents
and I'm going to be focusing that on the
deepest portion of my eye so right here
and then blending that into that lighter
color we already put down so right
basically under the brow I think this
would look really good with like white
dots are kind of like more of that like
boho or even crystals like around your
eyebrows I think it looked really pretty
so now that I've out of the yellow I'm
actually gonna go back in with desert
sands and just add a little bit right
here I feel like it kind of buffed it
away so there's a little bit more of a
harsh line than I want i'm going to go
back in with that color and just blend
the yellow and the lid color together
you don't need much I just
want to make sure it's a little more
seamless now that we have that done I'm
going to go in with Urban Decay's a
liner in roch I'm going to be lining my
tight line and then I'm also going to be
putting a little on my lower lashline
and smudging it out with my fingers now
that that's done I'm going to go in on
my lower lash line I'm taking the
synthetic flat part of this brush that
we use to place Tiki on the lid and I'm
going to be taking Tiki and putting it
closest to the lash line mostly focusing
it on the outer portion of the atty now
i'm taking a angled brush but it's kind
of a fatter one from Real Techniques and
I'm going to be taking the color
cantaloupe slice which is that darker
yellow color and blending that out
mostly keeping it again on the outer
portion and for this look today I'm not
going to bring it too far down on to
like my mic down too far I find it just
looks a little I don't know sickly which
I'm not oh I'm not like against but I
just don't want to look too like
charactery I still want it to look more
wearable I'm also going to go in with
just a stark white and I'm going to
highlight underneath the brow bone and I
just kind of wiped off my brush a little
bit and I'm gonna put white under there
this is Coastal Scents thank yous any
white shadow I would do on matte color
though I'm gonna use one more liner this
is a glitter liner from Sephora this is
in the color VIP gold I don't think you
can get this any longer but you could
definitely use one of the Urban Decay
ones or the next litter liners I'm going
to be putting this on my inner corner
basically I made a corner like the inner
part of my lower lashline just putting
it there and it's a paper liner goes a
little bit lower and not looking a super
fine line I kind of like that where it
looks kind of like a start loaded in
your inner corner and I do want to
highlight still so I'm going to just
take the tip of this angled brush and
I'm going to be taking the color starry
eyed for makeup geek it's just a really
foiled shadow and put that on the inner
corner now that I have that done I'm
going to go in with my mascara this is
the Urban Decay perversion mascara
absolutely love this it's my favorite
high in mascara and I'm going to coat my
top and bottom lashes in that video I
didn't have lashes on and I don't feel
like putting lashes on today so I'm not
going to and the last thing for the look
is the blue lips obviously this is line
crimes Velveteen liquid lipstick in
peacock you can use any blue
liquid lipstick that you have this is
just the one that I have so here's to
hoping I don't completely ruin my lip
line I am NOT an expert at putting on my
own liquid lipstick so fingers crossed
for me guys okay guys I think that's of
us are going to get on the lip I'm
actually pretty happy and pretty proud
of myself i did it pretty easily so i
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I
know this isn't for everyone but I did
get a couple requests from that video to
do it so I thought it would just be fun
to recreate plus I do really like this
look I just think there's something
about it so again I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you in my next
video hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
