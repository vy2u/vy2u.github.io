Lauren thank you so much for watching I
know I just did a haul but this one's a
bit different because it's all hair
products I know that seems excessive and
it kind of is but I recently went to
Arizona and if you don't know my mom is
a hairdresser so when we go out there we
always get our hair done and we also
usually stop by the Beauty Supply and I
pick up products because although I get
my discount here in LA it does not
compare to the discount she gets on hair
products because she's a licensed hair
cutter so I did pick up quite a few
things we were out of so much stuff I
don't know I feel like we ran out of
everything that we use on our hair me
and my husband Sam so yeah quite a few
things and I also wanted to try some
different things there were some amazing
deals and I couldn't pass them up so if
you guys are ever wondering the types of
products that I use although some of
these are new to me these are the types
of products that I almost always use on
my hair as well as my husband's hair oh
my gosh my computer sounds like it's
like gonna take off into outer space
it's like freaking me out and I hope it
doesn't die anyway enough talking I'll
explain things as we get into it it's
just kind of a lot of stuff I think
overall I spent about a little over a
hundred dollars on everything in here
which is pretty good because I have some
like high-end brands in this box first
off I bought a bunch of the puppies if
you've seen my empties videos you guys
know that the puppies are where it's at
for me and Sam will use these a lot
mostly Sam uses these actually this kind
of makes me mad the stickers off so I
hope no one use my product this is a
volumizing cloud mist is what they call
it it's basically a volumizing
texturizing powder but it's in a spray
form which is amazing so that's it it
just makes this product so easy to use I
believe they were the first to do it but
now I see a lot of people coming outfit
I know big sexy hair has one I also
think Paul Mitchell I saw Paul Mitchell
one at the beauty supply these retail
for like about $10 but they were buy one
get one free so we got them for about
like five dollars piece uh hence why
I've stocked up I was like even gonna
get more than this but I tried not to be
a crazy person Sam goes through about
one a month
so so we have about six months worth of
product my mom wanted me to bring this
home this is the dye that we use so if
you can't tell my roots have been redone
they're blonde and then we dyed them
pink they are a little bit washed out
because I washed my hair this morning
but this is what we use this is the from
EC Fram color in bold and it's the pink
color so it's just like a hot pink I
mostly use the viral-like shampoo I'll
leave that link down below if you want
to check that out and that's how I keep
up my color but my mom likes to dye the
blonde when we are doing it just to
hopefully give it a better Basin so
it'll last longer but I do suggest both
like actually dye your hair the first
time but then you know to keep it up and
basically what i only use unless i'm
getting my hair done by my mom is the
color shampoo that I use in the shower
this big old thing is for Sam this is
the Nioxin cleanser we've got it in
number two which is noticeably thinning
hair this is just the conditioner oh my
gosh this is the shampoo Sam's gonna be
so pissed well it was supposed to be the
conditioner but it is not it's the sham
freaking Phil how did this happen we
tried so hard to make sure we got the
right one well the reason we were gonna
get a conditioner this big is because he
goes through at the fastest and that's
the part you like keep on your head for
a couple minutes in the shower so if you
just runs through it faster and uses
more of it and he thinks it's like the
thing that actually works so we're gonna
have to switch that out when we go there
next month dang it that sex I hate that
because I feel like I usually try to be
so good about that stuff next I got some
products from AG haircare I don't know
what that stands for but I wanted to try
it some products as I haven't tried
anything from the brand this is the
simply dry dry shampoo I'm just
branching out where out of all the
batiste that I had a back stock on and
you guys know that's my number one
favorite it's probably what it will
suggest you guys the most and it'll
probably be my favorite because I just
can't beat how well it performs for the
price that I get it out at Marshall's so
it's just the best but I still liked
new things and this one was buy one get
one free so I got one in my mom got one
so I think it came out to like six
dollars a piece so I'm gonna try that
out and see how it works
hopefully it's good the next product
from AG is the tousled texture body and
shine finishing spray I got this because
I like to use texturizing products I
have very fine thin hair it's very fine
it's very thin and me and my mom joke
about it all the time but I mean it's
not a joke it's a little sad but we
cover it up with jokes you know and
that's why you don't wear my hair down
you guys never seen one hair down
because I just don't feel comfortable if
you want to see a picture of me with my
hair down check out my Instagram it's
always linked down below and you'll see
a picture of me and salmon my hair is
down it's right after it got dyed so
that's why I feel like my mom just
always gives us so much more body than I
ever can anyway I got this just for more
texturizing spray because we are using
the Moroccan oil one at the moment and I
like it because I love the smell I don't
think it's the best texturizing spray
though so yeah I believe this was about
nine or ten dollars and then the other
AG product I got is the dry wax and it's
a matte finishing mist I got this for me
and Sam
mostly for Sam now I just thought it
would be kind of cool I try to dry wax
before from Jiji TNG or whatever that
brand is you know what I'm talking about
has like really funky colors and the
packaging draws you in and they have
some like questionable looking packaging
you guys know I'm talking about
it's like Bed Head but then like the
other brand that's like a sister maybe
it was bad head anyway I just want to
try this again this was like nine
dollars or ten dollars they each were
about ten dollars and I just like the
packaging like everything about this
really drew me and so I wanted to give
it a try I picked this up for Sam this
is the texture clay from Moroccan oil
I love Moroccan oil scent I think their
products are really good I love their
volumizing shampoo and conditioner oh no
look at that look how dry that is that
doesn't seem right
okay well we'll be returning that to
okay I you know what this is making me
feel like this is my
me just totally realize that this is how
old is this I will go check it on its
side that's so upsetting this is it
looks like an old cream eyeshadow like
it's pulled away from the sides that
much so freaking frustrating guys I'm
just gonna go to a common profile here
and even though I don't have my account
I'm just gonna be like I know you're
gonna forget it switch this crap out
moving on to the next freaking product
this is the dry shampoo from Moroccan
all at least this can't be dried up in
the container but this is the light
tones dry shampoo my mom has been using
this and she like loves it so much so
she was like you have to get it so I got
it I think I got this for like $13 which
is a little bit more expensive for me at
the beauty store prices but I did it I
just bit the bullet this would retail
for like easily twenty-something dollars
so it's not that bad this is my last
like product I bought specifically
because it's a product this is the LPE
wild ginger hydro cream whip from Paul
Mitchell it's supposed to give you like
touchable hold the reason I chose this
is because they're really like a product
from Sebastian that's called their
whipped cream and it's a volumizing
product but it doesn't leave your hair
like crunchy and dry I feel like a lot
of mooses tend to do that and I don't
want that I want the volume but I want
my hair to still look shiny and I want
my hair to still feel like soft and like
there's moisture in it so I was hoping
this one would work really well I use it
for the first time today and I really do
like it
I then sprayed the tousle texture and I
feel like it made it look a little
greasy but when this was just in it I
really liked the way it felt in my hair
I used quite a bit of it maybe a little
bit too much and I was a little scared
that it would look really like heavy or
greasy but it still worked out well so I
am excited to use this the smell is not
my favorite it's a little bit like manly
yeah it's just like a little manly I
definitely smell a little bit of that
ginger as well but I do really like the
product so I'm excited for that and I
hope Sam likes it too the next few items
are all things I picked up and a couple
I don't want to say it probably
shouldn't but I probably shouldn't my
mom talked me into these and it's like
mom you know what my channels about you
watch every single video why are you
trying to like stop me from being good
anyway
they had like a table where you could
pick seven products for five dollars and
I just wanted a couple of them but you
you're gonna pay the $5 or under what so
I was like well I might as well get
seven thing so these seven things all
cost five dollars altogether but this
has me questioning and I kind of thought
it when I was in the store but I just
like shoved that feeling down because my
mom and I don't know I just thought this
will be fun
but I wonder how all these products are
like why are they getting rid of these
things and I think that's something
definitely to consider when you're
buying stuff anyway uh-huh pence though
Moroccan oil I mean this product cost me
about thirteen dollars let me just
finish showing you two things this is
the Schwarzkopf I don't know how to say
it quite this is the shine duster velvet
shine powder it says number one light
control have no idea what this does I
was thinking it was like one of the
powders like the volumizing powders so I
was like oh maybe I should try it out
and I just thought like that's such a
good deal on it so we're gonna try that
see what it's like the other product
that I did want to pick up this is the
power spray fast dry finishing spray
from the joy Co and I wanted to pick
this up because it's a small size it's
great for in my kit and just different
things like that
I'm just to have a nice little like
travel hair spray for when you need it
so that's why I wanted to pick this up
there were two of them
I got one my mom got one and so those
are the two things that were like
actually like oh I want to actually try
those and maybe use them the rest of the
things I got just to fill up the seven
items so the next two things I don't
even know if we're gonna use them like I
don't know if that's wasteful or not I
haven't decided these are the I don't
even know locks in my defense zone is
the brand I guess it's this is number
one but this is a pre-shampoo exfoliant
for scalp and hair you're supposed to
put this on before you go in the shower
and like exfoliate your scalp but this
like broke and I don't know
I don't know that didn't happen I think
the pressure from traveling um you know
like up the mountains over the state
like somehow pop this thing open so I
don't know if we're gonna use it
actually yeah the other part is step
three so I don't know where step two is
this is the leave-in treatment for anti
dandruff and Sam has quite a bit of
dandruff he just has dry skin so I
thought maybe this could help him but I
don't know again I don't know if he's
gonna use it or if he should even use it
so this haul is turned like downhill so
much I thought was gonna be just fun
talking about some fun things and then
look look what happened next this is the
this is just like a little all-in-one
hair treatment from unique one I don't
even know what that brand is it's just
like a one-time use oh so I just want to
get that I just want to try it and get
it out I don't know how old it is so
it's also like I definitely need to
decide if I'm gonna use these things and
like use them within I want to say a
month because I don't want them just
like sitting around and this last thing
here this is the power sculpt Hartwell
gel and yeah it's like a creamy texture
this still has like the lid over it they
probably just didn't sell many of them
it's just kind of like a gel so but it's
like a creamy gel anyway I liked how
small this was to use on people's hair
it still smells really nice so anyway
that's everything so that's what I
bought sorry that this hall turned
downhill but these are my first
reactions to some of the things when I
didn't know they were what they were oh
my gosh I just realized that like while
I was recording have fun I hope you
enjoyed the video let me know what some
of your favorite hair products are down
below especially if you are looking for
volume if you have fine or thin hair if
you have color treated hair any
suggestions are always welcome because
I'm still on the hunt for those perfect
products for me like I found some things
I really do like but I'm always willing
to try some new things and hopefully you
know get my hair to a place where I can
wear it down and feel comfortable but
you know I still think I look really
cute with my hair up
so it's not just from insecurity of that
it's just I like this why would I do the
other thing I'm done talking I will talk
to you guys in my next video though bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
