Lawrence this is going to be a haul
video and I think if I time this right
this might be like the last set of
videos that i do right before
thanksgiving so i wanted to say happy
thanksgiving to everyone out there i'm
super excited cuz i'm going home for
family so i don't know how much i'm
going to be uploading or if i'm gonna be
uploading like pre-recorded stuff or
anything like that so if this is how i
think i'm uploading my videos that i
already have filmed happy thanksgiving
if not happy thanksgiving before or
after and i hope you had a good one or i
hope it's going to be good anyway let's
get into this haul video this is stuff
that has been sent to me so it's kind of
like a mailbox hall but i also have a
few things at the end that i've
purchased that i thought i would just
show you i did a halt I think I don't
even know i feel like i'm doing halls
more often and it feels like it's like
so often gosh I have an itch so bad I
feel like I've been doing a lot more
holes so it feels like they're really
close to each other but I think these
might be actually like a month apart so
it's not too bad right I don't know
let's just get started obviously even if
stuff sent to me i'm going to tell you
my honest opinion that's just how i roll
so so first thing I wanted to talk about
the new pair of glasses I was sent from
firm you know i did pay ten dollars for
these technically because my eyes are
that messed up that I have to have the
special lenses and so yeah I paid ten
dollars but overall they were like sent
to me for free essentially they came in
a really nice compact this is the same
one as the last paragraph so it's the
exact same pattern it does have like an
indent afirma but nothing obnoxious this
is what they look like I chose something
kind of standard for me I do have my
other pairs of glasses just to show you
those too but this is what they look
like on super cute I really do like them
the only thing about these is that I do
feel like these are less sturdy than the
last pair i got i'm going to show you
those i just find the frames are a
little bit more bendy than my last pair
these are thinner frames so it could
just be the make of these specific
glasses but that was just something i
noticed immediately getting them from
you is a great site if you want to
purchase prescription sunglasses regular
sunglasses regular glasses for a really
good price they have really cute
up-to-date style some are really funky
but they're affordable which is amazing
and so I think these if you just bought
them would have been like I think right
at twenty dollars so it's still a good
price and it's nothing that would stop
me from wearing them i'm still gonna
wear them I just think that there that's
just something I noticed immediately off
the bat so I did want to say that but I
do think they're really cute if they're
still on i will link them down below the
last pair i got it sold out so fast so
um i wasn't able to link it but
hopefully these are still there if you
want to try them out they do have a
little bit of that tortoise shell at the
bottom i really do like these and just
in general i suggest for mu not only do
you guys but in my real life when i'm
wearing my glasses out and someone
complements me I'll tell them about it
because I think it's a really awesome
site so they are gonna give me a coupon
code at this time when I'm filming this
I don't know that information so it'll
be listed down below if you are
interested in it anyway check that down
below if you're interested I am going to
show you the other para got the last
time these ones just are more sturdy
like they just don't bend around but
again there are different glass so I
think that is probably why these are so
cute these just have more detailing
they're just different glasses and I
just enjoy these ones better but they
are still from firm oh they're so cute i
love these so much they're really dirty
hopefully you can't see that on screen
moving on from from oh I have some stuff
from Oxley I've tested I think all of
this stuff out and yeah I have some
opinions on it so it's not just a halt
it's also a little bit of a review let's
get into it okay these are from Orly and
I put in for these and I thought they
were literally going to be like half the
size they were and I wasn't sure if I
was gonna get all three or just like one
of the three oh no they sent me all
three and they sent them huge these are
like almost professional sighs I feel
like anyway these are exfoliating scrubs
for the hands feet and body and there
are three different scents so they're
the same product same formula same
consistency just different sense so the
first one here is spiced vanilla and
white teeth the next one is the passion
one which is neem and faye whoaa dude
totally getting me with that name I'm
not really sure it'll all be in the
description box and the last one is the
pucker and this is papaya and grapefruit
so I've been testing these out I really
do like them my favorite scent would be
the one I can't
of course this one here in the purple
but all of these scents have a very
subtle scent payoff you can still smell
it it smells amazing but it's just more
spa-like and not so like in-your-face
bath and Bodyworks party party party
sent and I really enjoy that actually
about it I prefer using these on dry
hands so I'll squeeze out a little bit
put it on my dry hands and rub and then
I'll add a little bit of water and I
find that that just gives me the best to
grab it feels so good there's just this
feeling of it that just is like ecstasy
it feels so good when you're scrubbing
your hands especially if you work with
your hands or your hands can get kind of
tired not only is it helping to like get
rid of dead skin but I find it's just a
refreshing feeling and almost like a
little massage and I've really been
enjoying that I haven't tried it on my
feet my feet are like monsters so I feel
like I'm probably just gonna use these
on my hands I have used them on my body
though and I just don't prefer it the
granules of sugar are kind of small so I
just find that for the hands they just
work the best they're just really nice
i'm not sure where you can pick these up
I'll have links down below the next two
things are from the same brand they're
from YBF which stands for your best
friend I believe you can get these
products on HSN home shopping netwerk so
the first thing I picked up was a set of
color correctors now I'm not super big
on the color correcting trend I haven't
tried a ton of color correctors and I
saw this and I thought you know I'm
interested in that I thought they'd be
nice to put in my kid I have to say I do
really like these these are not going to
give you like crazy full coverage yellow
and green and purple stripes across your
face they're definitely more subtle the
packaging on these reminds me of the
tart shaped tape has that huge doe foot
applicator I mean it's like exactly the
same packaging the thing I love the most
about these is the texture the texture
is absolutely divine I swatch this on my
hand and that's how i've been using it i
put on the back my hand and then use it
on my face since i want to use them for
my kit it feels so nice so insanely nice
it blends into the skin it looks like
skin there's no like pockets of color i
cannot rave enough about the texture of
these i've only used three out of the
four I just haven't had a use for the
purple one I don't have any like yellow
spots or
anything that's like needs brightening
really that this would do the 30 views
though I've really enjoyed this peachy
ones for under the eyes to correct any
dark circles again this isn't going to
give you like a full coverage look this
is just going to help correct any
discoloration you might have under the
eye while still being undetectable and
that's the thing I really like about
these these are great for like more
subtle makeup everyday makeup these are
not your full coverage like I'm going
out clubbing but I really do like I'm so
excited to have them in my kid the green
one I really enjoy for putting on like
just areas of redness I have a lot of
redness on my face and very pale so a
lot of just you know red pigmentation
comes through um under my skin I was a
little scared at first because this
looks kind of minty and not like super
green but I find it works really well on
really big patches of red so like my
cheeks my nose and it just kind of toned
it down is it completely skin toned no
is a completely green though no it just
kind of tones down that redness and then
when I go in with my foundation it just
has less to do because this has done its
job and that's what I really like I
don't like this for a spot concealing
it's not going to like get rid of a
really red pimple it'll tone it down but
it's not going to like completely cover
that I think these are work on so many
different skin types o like more mature
skin in fine lines and wrinkles they're
just a really nice product and something
that's great about this brand is I feel
like it's pretty affordable you get all
four of these for 3490 i believe which i
think is so great for how much product
you're getting enough about those will
move on to the other product this is the
YBF eyebrow pencil and this is a
universal eyebrow pencil gosh its really
been hard for me to say eyebrow pencil
um so forgive me this is a great eyebrow
pencil it has a spoolie on one end not
my favorites bully but it's definitely
soft so it's not like the worst bully
ever i just wish i had a tapered end i
feel like that would just like make it
the most the pencil itself though is
really nice this is all from this one
pencil so it looks like different shades
it's supposed to be universal and a kind
arising of the it cosmetics but I do
like the texture of this butter this is
a very dry pencil so it's kind of like a
powdery finish you can definitely get
individual like hair strokes with this
pencil I've really been liking it it's
not what I'm wearing today but I haven't
using it I can get a little over handed
with it and it can look a little dark
but I personally don't mind a harsh brow
on myself so I don't know I've really
been liking this though it's just really
nice and this is twelve dollars or you
can get a 2-pack for 22 so another thing
i really like is that these are like
high quality products but you're getting
them at a guy feel like a good price
compared to honest hacia or other
high-end products out there and I
thought I'd mention to the packaging on
this feels really nice and waited it
doesn't feel cheap at all I was really
genuinely surprised by this brand and I
really do like the products i got from
them i have two more products from
octiline the next one is from body
ography and this is a glitter pigment I
got this to do a first impressions on
but I decided that I couldn't wait and I
used it today so this is in the color
sparkler and it has a little stopper in
it it kind of reminds me of the Loreal
infallible with how the stopper is this
is what the color looks like again it's
what i'm wearing on the inner portion of
my lids today and it's exactly that it's
a glitter pigment this feels kind of
moosie though it reminds me of a color
pop shadow or almost like the elf ones
but this is mostly glitter payoff i will
say i think this is very similar to
color pop shadows it's absolutely
beautiful the glitter is really nice and
today with my first like impression of
it I put it on the lid and I had a
little bit of glitter fallout but
nothing too bad I felt like once I have
my makeup on I've really been enjoying
this I'm excited to do like a holiday
look with this using my metal matte
palette um so that'll be coming soon if
you guys want to see this in action it's
really nice I think it's good quality
and if you are interested in it it's a
good product like it has a really nice
shine to it and it's thin though it
still has like a thin consistency again
very similar to color pop I feel like
and the last product that I have from
actually to share with you guys is a
nukes product i've reviewed quite a bit
of nukes on my channel i'll leave those
down below I really do enjoy this brand
I think that they put out really high
quality products and they are more
natural which i think is wonderful this
is a daytime serum and it is the nuke
salons a clot anti-aging care it's
supposed to smooth re plump and
illuminate and I've really been enjoying
this in the morning it feels very nice
on the skin it's not too heavy I find
that makeup goes over it really nicely
that's what it looks like
it isn't one of those really runny
serums and I've just really been
enjoying it this serum pairs with their
detox 14 night and I've actually gone
through a full one of those because I
bought it as gratis at my old job and I
really loved that serum this does have
quite an intense smell it's still like
natural but it's something I feel like
maybe some people wouldn't like it's
almost floral but I think it smells I
think it smells kind of nice and it kind
of reminds me of the other serum I used
from them so it's kind of just like
memories I've only been using this stuff
for a little bit so I can't tell you
about like the anti-aging and I'm also
younger so I feel like I wouldn't be
able to tell entirely but I've really
been enjoying this and i highly suggest
checking out mix products if you're
looking for something that's more
natural or just a really nice overall
skin care brand so those are all the
things that were sent to me now on to
things that i've actually purchased
myself first thing i bought by myself is
something i regret and i might be
returning I got this from Sephora this
was actually during the sale so I got it
twenty percent off thank goodness these
are from la vanilla and they are the
natural deodorants me and Sam were out
and about and I need a deodorant and we
happen to be by Sephora we were in the
mall and we were watching a movie later
that was in the mall anyway long story
this was just like the easiest situation
plus I thought since I'm getting twenty
percent off I'll try them out again I
have tried these in the past and they
just kind of dried out fast so I didn't
really get to use it and I didn't like
him I still don't like him and I don't
think they work they don't work for me
if you're gonna be literally like
sitting in a if you're gonna be in your
house just sitting sure maybe these work
great for you but if you're actually
like a human and out doing stuff and
being active and not even active like
I'm working out just like I'm not
sitting at home um these don't work for
me I'm just too much too much woman for
these so yeah I'm definitely thinking
about returning them or maybe I'll put
these in people's stockings like I don't
know what I'm gonna do I probably should
just get my money back though I don't
suggest these and I'm disappointed it
makes me want to like go back to regular
deodorants so bad I picked up one of the
wet'n'wild brushes from the dollar store
this is just one of the like lid brushes
and it's super soft I'm excited to use
it it was just so cute and it was a
dollar so I was like I'll get it another
thing I picked up at the dollar store
was the palmers cocoa butter formula and
it's just the original lip balm there
was a product from Palmer's that I
really liked it was a face moisturizer
and I can't find it anywhere I never
found it after that one time I bought it
it was so nice and I really wish I could
purchase that again but I've never been
able to find it so anyway that came to
mind when I saw this and as I go I'll
try it out plus it's in like the cool
packaging I haven't used it a ton so I
don't have like a review but I don't
know if I like things in this packaging
it's just kind of weird to put on but
anyway I bought that just cuz i am kind
of out of lip balms and if you know me i
look like a badass in this lip color
right now but most of the time i'm in
just like regular lip balms speaking of
lip balms we're on to the next products
i'm so in love with these let me go get
the peach one it's in my setback colon
so if you guys watch my October
favorites you guys know that I put this
in this is from Revlon and it is the
Revlon kiss bomb this one right here is
in the scent tropical coconut it smells
so good I've used this so much and I
just enjoy it I love the texture I love
how it moisturizes it's not like the
most moisturizing balm ever it's not
like the fresh ones but it's really nice
for the drugstore these are like five
dollars and change which is a little
expensive i guess but compared to
drugstore lip products I'm like okay
I'll take it so anyway this is the first
1i bought I love it it smells so good so
I went back and I picked up to two more
so these are the other two I picked up
the first one here is in the Apple sent
I mostly chose these based off of a
scent but that's a swatch of it super
sheer which is what I love I love just
easy lip products that smell good who
doesn't I just have really been enjoying
these and I'm so happy I got it the
other one is peach which I'm like yes
and it's watch next to it's super light
and perfect for me for every single day
this is something I know I'm going to
get so much use out of plus it smells
like peaches these are the new baby lips
guys and i love them i really do I'm
tempted to pick up more from the
collection but I just don't know if i'll
use them so i'm just going to use these
for a little bit longer maybe i'll pick
them up these are coming soon if you
haven't seen them what I look these up
the Revlon website didn't even have them
on there yet so they're coming
you should be seeing them pop up but I
put these up at CVS so I would check
your CVS as if you're looking for these
and the last thing I have to show you
guys is a Gwent and wild mega last nail
color and this is in are you free to
dance this is part of their new
limited-edition collection and I just
couldn't resist this polish this is like
a purple pink and blue duochrome glitter
it's a clear base with those like
iridescent shimmers in it this is a
great topper nail polish definitely not
something you'd use on your own you'd
have to like go to nail polish mountain
to even see it I really like this I put
it over a blue polish and it really
showed up quite blue actually like
that's the color took on so if you were
looking for definitely check out the
limited edition like displays and I
would try to get that soon you might be
able to get it off the website too when
wild does do limited ish and stuff on
their site that's everything for this
hall I hope you guys enjoyed it
everything will be listed down below if
you're interested in anything hopefully
I talked at least semi decently because
seriously I'm telling him and have to
add a lot of stuff out like I'm just
blabbering and also just not even making
sense so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
and I will see you in my next video bye
