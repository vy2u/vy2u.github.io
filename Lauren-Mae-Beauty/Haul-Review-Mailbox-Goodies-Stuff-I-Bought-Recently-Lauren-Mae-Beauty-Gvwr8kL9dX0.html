Lawrence this is going to be a haul
video and I think if I time this right
this might be like the last set of
videos that I do right before
Thanksgiving so I wanted to say Happy
Thanksgiving to everyone out there I'm
super excited cuz I'm going home for
family so I don't know how much I'm
going to be uploading or if I'm going to
be uploading like pre-recorded stuff or
anything like that so if this is how I
think I'm uploading my videos that I
already have filmed Happy Thanksgiving
if not Happy Thanksgiving before or
after and I hope you had a good one or I
hope it's going to be good anyway let's
get into this haul video this is stuff
that it has been sent to me so it's kind
of like a mail box haul but I also have
a few things at the end that I've
purchased that I thought I would just
show you I did a haul I think I don't
even know I feel like I'm doing hauls
more often and it feels like it's like
so often gosh I have an itch so bad I
feel like I've been doing a lot more
hauls so it feels like they're really
close to each other but I think these
might be actually like a month apart so
it's not too bad right I don't know
let's just get started obviously even if
stuff sent to me I'm gonna tell you my
honest opinion that's just how I roll so
so first thing I wanted to talk about
the new pair of glasses I was sent from
fer mail now I did pay $10 for these
technically because my eyes are that
messed up that I have to have the
special lenses and so yeah I paid $10
but overall they were like sent to me
for free essentially they came in a
really nice compact this is the same one
as the last paragraph so it's the exact
same pattern it does have like an indent
afirma but nothing obnoxious this is
what they look like
I chose something kind of standard for
me I do have my other pairs of glasses
just to show you those two but this is
what they look like on super cute I
really do like them the only thing about
these is that I do feel like these are
less sturdy than the last pair I got I'm
gonna show you those I just find the
frames are a little bit more bendy than
my last pair these are thinner frames so
it could just be the make of these
specific glasses but that was just
something I noticed immediately getting
them for a meal is a great sight if you
want to purchase prescription sunglasses
regular sunglasses regular glasses for a
really good price they have really cute
up-to-date styles some are really funky
but they're affordable which is amazing
and so I think these if you just bought
them would have been like I think right
at $20 so it's still a good price and
it's nothing that would stop me from
wearing them I'm still gonna wear them I
just think that they're that's just
something I noticed immediately off the
bat so I did want to say that but I do
think they're really cute if they're
still on I will link them down below the
last pair I got it sold out so fast so I
wasn't able to link it but hopefully
these are still there if you want to try
them out they do have a little bit of
that tortoiseshell at the bottom I
really do like these and just in general
I suggest for MU not only to you guys
but in my real life when I'm wearing my
glasses out and someone complements me
I'll tell them about it because I think
it's a really awesome sight so they are
gonna give me a coupon code at this time
when I'm filming this I don't know that
information so it'll be listed down
below if you are interested in it anyway
check that down below if you're
interested I am gonna show you the other
parent got the last time these ones just
are more sturdy like they just don't
bend around but again there are
different glasses so I think that is
probably why these are so cute these
just have more detailing they're just
different glasses and I just enjoy these
ones better but they are still from firm
oh they're so cute I love these so much
they're really dirty hopefully you can't
see that on screen moving on from from
oh I have some stuff from obsolete I've
tested I think all of this stuff out and
yeah I have some opinions on it so it's
not just a haul it's also a little bit
of a review let's get into it okay
these are from Orly and I put in for
these and I thought they were literally
gonna be like half the size they were
and I wasn't sure if I was gonna get all
three or just like one of the three oh
no they sent me l3 and they sent them
huge these are like almost professional
size I feel like anyway these are
exfoliating scrubs for the hands feet
and body and there are three different
scents so they're the same product same
formula same consistency just different
scents so the first one here is spiced
vanilla and white tea the next one is
the passion one which is neem and PHA
whoaa dude totally getting me with that
name I'm not really sure it'll all be in
the description box and the last one is
the pucker and this is papaya and
grapefruit so I've been testing these
out I really do like them my favorite
scent would be the one I can't
of course this one here in the purple
but all of these sons have a very subtle
scent-- pay off you can still smell it
it smells amazing but it's just more
spa-like and not so like in-your-face
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works party party party
scent and I really enjoy that actually
about it I prefer using these on dry
hands so I'll squeeze out a little bit
put it on my dry hands and rub and then
I'll add a little bit of water and I
find that that just gives me the best to
grab it feels so good there's just this
feeling of it that just is like ecstasy
it feels so good when you're scrubbing
your hands especially if you work with
your hands or your hands can get kind of
tired not only is it helping to like get
rid of dead skin but I find it's just a
refreshing feeling and almost like a
little massage and I've really been
enjoying that I haven't tried it on my
feet my feet are like monsters so I feel
like I'm probably just gonna use these
on my hands I have used them on my body
though and I just don't prefer it the
granules of sugar are kind of small so I
just find that for the hands they just
work the best they're just really nice
I'm not sure where you can pick these up
I'll have links down below the next two
things are from the same brand they're
from YBF which stands for your best
friend I believe you can get these
products on HSN Home Shopping Network so
the first thing I picked up was a set of
color correctors now I'm not super big
on the color correcting trend I haven't
tried a ton of color correctors and I
saw this and I thought you know I'm
interested in that I thought they'd be
nice to put in my kit I have to say I do
really like these these are not going to
give you like crazy full coverage yellow
and green and purple stripes across your
face they're definitely more subtle the
packaging on these reminds me of the
Tarte shaped ape has that huge doe foot
applicator I mean it's like exactly the
same packaging the thing I love the most
about these is the texture the texture
is absolutely divine I swatch this on my
hand and that's how I've been using it I
put on the back of my hand and then use
it on my face since I want to use them
for my kit it feels so nice so insanely
nice it blends into the skin it looks
like skin there's no like pockets of
color
I cannot rave enough about the texture
of these I've only used three out of the
floor I just haven't had a use for the
purple one I don't have any like yellow
spots or
anything that's like needs brightening
really that this would do the three have
use though I've really enjoyed this PG
ones for under the eyes to correct any
dark circles again this isn't going to
give you like a full coverage look this
is just going to help correct any
discoloration you might have under the
eye while still being undetectable and
that's the thing I really like about
these these are great for like more
subtle makeup everyday makeup these are
not your full coverage like I'm going
out clubbing but I really do like them
I'm so excited to have them in my kit
the green one I really enjoyed for
putting on like just areas of redness I
have a lot of redness on my face
I'm very pale so a lot of just you know
red pigmentation comes through under my
skin I was a little scared at first
because this looks kind of minty and not
like super green but I find it works
really well on really big patches of red
so like my cheeks my nose and it just
kind of tones it down is it completely
skin toned
no is it completely green though no it
just kind of tones down that redness and
then when I go in with my foundation it
just has less to do because this has
done its job and that's what I really
like I don't like this for a spot
concealing it's not going to like get
rid of a really red pimple it'll tone it
down but it's not gonna like completely
cover that I think these would work on
so many different skin types so like
more mature skin and fine lines and
wrinkles they're just a really nice
product and something that's great about
this brand is I feel like it's pretty
affordable you get all four of these for
3490 I believe which i think is so great
for how much product you're getting
enough about those we'll move on to the
other product this is the YBF eyebrow
pencil and this is a universal eyebrow
pencil oh gosh it's really been hard for
me to say eyebrow pencil so forgive me
this is a great eyebrow pencil it has a
spoolie on one end not my favorites
bully but it's definitely soft so it's
not like the worst bully ever I just
wish I had a tapered end I feel like
that would just like make it the most
the pencil itself though is really nice
this is all from this one pencil so it
looks like different shades it's
supposed to be universal and it kinda
reminds me of the it cosmetics but I do
like the texture of this better this is
a very dry pencil so it's kind of like a
powdery finish you can definitely get
individual like hair strokes with this
pencil I've really been liking
it's not what I'm wearing today but I
haven't using it I can get a little over
handed with it and it can look a little
dark but I personally don't mind a harsh
brow on myself so I don't know I've
really been liking this though it's just
really nice and this is $12 or you can
get a two pack for twenty two so another
thing I really like is that these are
like high quality products but you're
getting them at a guy I feel like a good
price compared to honest Asya or other
high-end products out there and I
thought I'd mention to you the packaging
on this feels really nice and weighted
it doesn't feel cheap at all
I was really genuinely surprised by this
brand and I really do like the products
I got from them I have two more products
from octiline the next one is from body
ography and this is a glitter pigment I
got this to do a first impressions on
but I decided that I couldn't wait and I
used it today
so this is in the color sparkler and it
has a little stopper in it it kind of
reminds me of the L'Oreal infallible
with how the stopper is this is what the
color looks like again it's what I'm
wearing on the inner portion of my lids
today and it's exactly that it's a
glitter pigment this feels kind of
moosie though it reminds me of a color
pop shadow or almost like the elf ones
but this is mostly glitter payoff I will
say I think this is very similar to
color pop shadows it's absolutely
beautiful the glitter is really nice and
today with my first like impression of
it I put it on the lid and I had a
little bit of glitter fallout but
nothing too bad I felt like once I had
my makeup on I've really been enjoying
this I'm excited to do like a holiday
look with this using my metal matte
palette so that'll be coming soon if you
guys want to see this in action it's
really nice I think it's good quality
and if you were interested in it it's a
good product like it has a really nice
shine to it and it's thin though it
still has like a thin consistency again
very similar to color pop I feel like
and the last product that I have from
actually to share with you guys is a
nukes product I've reviewed quite a bit
of nukes on my channel I'll leave those
down below I really do enjoy this brand
I think that they put out really high
quality products and they are more
natural which i think is wonderful this
is a daytime serum and it is the nukes
lens a clot anti-aging care it's
supposed to smooth re-plump and
illuminate and I've really been in
in the morning it feels very nice on the
skin but it's not too heavy
I find that makeup goes over it really
nicely that's what it looks like it
isn't one of those really runny serums
and I've just really been enjoying it
this serum pairs with their detox one
for night and I've actually gone through
a full one of those because I bought it
as gratis at my old job and I really
loved that serum this does have quite an
intense smell it's still like natural
but it's something I feel like maybe
some people wouldn't like it's almost
floral but I think it smells I think it
smells kind of nice and it kind of
reminds me of the other serum I used
from them so it's kind of just like
memories I've only been using this stuff
for a little bit so I can't tell you
about like the anti-aging and I'm also
younger so I feel like I wouldn't be
able to tell entirely but I've really
been enjoying this and I highly suggest
checking out NYX products if you're
looking for something that is more
natural or just a really nice overall
skincare brand so those are all the
things that were sent to me and now onto
things that I've actually purchased
myself first thing I bought by myself is
something I regret and I might be
returning I got this from Sephora this
was actually during the sale so I got it
20% off thank goodness these are from la
vanilla and they are the natural
deodorants me and Sam were out and about
and I need a deodorant and we happened
to be by Sephora
we were in the mall and we were watching
a movie later that was in the mall
anyway long story this was just like the
easiest situation plus I thought since
I'm getting 20% off I'll try them out
again
I have tried these in the past and they
just kind of dried out fast so I didn't
really get to use it and I didn't like
them
I still don't like them and I don't
think they work they don't work for me
if you're gonna be literally like
sitting in a if you're gonna be in your
house just sitting sure maybe these work
great for you but if you're actually
like a human and out doing stuff and
being active and not even active like
I'm working out just like I'm not
sitting at home um these don't work for
me I'm just too much too much woman for
these so yeah I'm definitely thinking
about returning them or maybe I'll put
these in people's stockings like I don't
know what I'm gonna do I probably should
just get my money back though I don't
suggest these and I'm disappointed it
makes me want to like go back to regular
G odorant so bad I picked up one of the
wet and wild brushes from the dollar
store this is just one of the like lid
brushes and it's super soft I'm excited
use it which is so cute and it was $1 so
I was like I'll get it another thing I
picked up at the dollar store was the
Palmers cocoa butter formula and it's
just the original lip balm there was a
product from Palmers that I really liked
it was a face moisturizer and I can't
find it anywhere
I never found it after that one time I
bought it it was so nice and I really
wish I could purchase that again but
I've never been able to find it so
anyway that came to mind when I saw this
and I was like oh I'll try it out plus
it's in like the cool packaging I
haven't used it a ton so I don't have
like a review but I don't know if I like
things in this packaging it's just kind
of weird to put on but anyway I bought
that just because I am kind of out of
lip balms and if you know me I look like
a badass in this lip color right now but
most of the time I'm in just like
regular lip balms speaking of lip balms
we're on to the next products I'm so in
love with these let me go get the peach
one it's in my set back : so if you guys
watched my October favorites you guys
know that I put this in this is from
Revlon and it is the Revlon kiss balm
this one right here is in the scent
tropical coconut it smells so good I've
used this so much and I just enjoy it I
love the texture I love how it
moisturizes it's not like the most
moisturizing balm ever it's not like the
fresh ones but it's really nice for the
drugstore these are like five dollars
and change which is a little expensive I
guess but compared to the drugstore lip
products I'm like okay I'll take it so
anyway this is the first one I bought I
love it it smells so good so I went back
and I picked up two more so these are
the other two I picked up the first one
here is in the apple scent I mostly
chose these based off of a scent but
that's a swatch of it super sheer which
is what I love I love just easy lip
products that smell good who doesn't I
just have really been enjoying these and
I'm so happy I got it the other one is
peach which I'm like yes and it's
watched next to it's super light and
perfect for me for every single day this
is something I know I'm gonna get so
much use out of plus it smells like
peaches these are the new baby lips guys
and I love them I really do I'm tempted
to pick up more from the collection but
I just don't know if I'll use them so
I'm just gonna use these for a little
bit longer maybe I'll pick them up these
are coming soon if you haven't seen them
what I look these up the Revlon website
didn't even have them on there
so they're coming soon you should be
seeing them pop up but I picked these up
at CVS so I would check your CVS as if
you're looking for these and the last
thing I have to show you guys is a
Quentin Wilde megalast and nail color
and this is in are you free to dance
this is part of their new
limited-edition collection and I just
couldn't resist this polish this is like
a purple pink and blue duochrome glitter
it's a clear base with those like
iridescent shimmers in it this is a
great topper nail polish it's definitely
not something you'd use on your own
you'd have to like go to nail polish
Mountain to even see it I really like
this I put it over a blue polish and it
really showed up quite blue actually
like that's the color took on so if you
were looking for definitely check out
the limited edition like displays and I
would try to get that soon you might be
able to get it off the website too when
Wilde does do limited edition stuff on
their site that's everything for this
haul I hope you guys enjoyed it
everything will be listed down below if
you're interested in anything
hopefully I talked at least semi
decently because seriously I'm telling
him and have to add a lot of stuff out
like I'm just blabbering and also just
not even making sense so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed and I will see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
