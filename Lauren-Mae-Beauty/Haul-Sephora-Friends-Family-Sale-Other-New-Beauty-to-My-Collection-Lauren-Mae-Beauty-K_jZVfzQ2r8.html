Lauren thank you so much for watching
just to get this out of the way before
we get into it I did decide to put my
hair up I tried really hard guys to have
my hair down and just so hot and then
it's just too much so up it went the eye
look and everything is from my deck of
scarlet video if you want to check out
how I did that there's a demo at the end
I did switch out the lip though this is
one of the lips in the nude Stix kit
that I got anyway I think that's enough
of that let's get into this haul video I
wanted to do a haul before I do my anti
haul which is what I'm filming after
this I didn't know what the best order
was I was like should I anti haul and
then haul something but I thought it was
better if I hauled stuff and then did an
anti haul afterwards this is all stuff I
picked up recently or that's been sent
to me I'm gonna show you the stuff that
I got from these Sephora vib sale first
I didn't get too much I'm pretty proud
of myself and then the rest is just
stuff I've picked up along the way Sam
got me a couple of things for our
anniversary and then I have some
actually things at the end mostly I
wanted to give you guys a look into what
I've brought into my collection so that
way if you guys want reviews or anything
like that you guys can let me know when
I can make those videos for you and
that's it let's get into it the first
thing I wanted to show you is probably
the biggest item that I did pick up and
I decided to get that perfume that I
wanted from my wishlist video I'm gonna
leave that link down below I think I'm
gonna do one more before the end of the
year just to show you guys like what I'm
really wanting and also maybe an update
to that one cuz I have picked up a
couple things actually from that wish
list
anyway I chose to pick up the big bottle
of the English oak and red currant
cologne from Jo Malone so I did pick up
the big one I used the 20% off sale to
save some money the wonky brow I believe
here on YouTube sent me a direct message
and a bunch of other people thank you so
much so that's how I got my 20% off I
really do like this scent I'm a little
worried though I sprayed this and I
smelled it I was so excited but I never
sprayed it on myself and so I'm gonna
keep testing it but if I don't love it
I'm gonna return this and get the
BlackBerry in Bay one I hate it though I
hate that I think that because it's like
I don't know I feel like a lot of things
in this hall are like that
that's just a warning no it smells
really really good
I just want to like be in love with it
if I'm going to be spending the money on
it so I don't want this to ever be
something that I have to work through if
that makes sense so anyway I do really
like it I don't want that to be like
this sour note I just need to test it
out a little bit more and make sure that
I absolutely love it on my skin but yeah
that's the first thing I got I still am
really excited about that and the only
other thing was a glitter liner from
Urban Decay they just came out with a
bunch of new colors and I mean these
colors are so pretty they have like two
pinks and the white I decided to just
pick up the white one in the color pyro
it's like a holographic white it's
absolutely stunning so excited I picked
this up and I cannot wait to pick up the
like lighter pink and the darker pink
I'm so excited guys this is definitely
something I'm glad I got the discount on
I highly suggest these glitter liners
they work so well it's such an easy way
to incorporate glitter without having
like loose glitter everywhere and I love
that you don't have to like dirty a
brush because seriously if you get
glitter in a brush like good luck
getting it out I think I've mentioned
this before but glitter is the herpes of
the makeup world sorry I don't know
where I was I was I got a call sheet and
I needed to read it so I know what I'm
doing tomorrow
that's everything that I like paid for
from Sephora I did decide to pick up a
hundred point perk and for that I chose
the eye basics prime and color correct
and this is the shade wheat from Laura
Mercier I have been using my Maybelline
one and I'm getting kind of low on it
and it's the only eye primer that I have
so I thought I would try this one out
for a hundred points next I want to show
you guys what Sam picked me up for an
anniversary we celebrated our 10 year
anniversary on October 13th Friday the
13th were very spooky if you guys follow
me on Instagram then you probably saw my
post but I wasn't expecting it because
we're not really like I mean it's just
you know it's ten years we don't need
gifts every single year we don't really
celebrate Valentine's Day that much like
we just celebrated our left every day so
we don't need like special days to
really do anything anyway enough of that
he did surprise me with a gift though I
was really excited because I
love gifts so this is it it's a huge tin
and it has all these flowers on it and
this is from Crabtree and Evelyn he got
this from Costco and one of her favorite
things to do is to go to Costco and just
like look around and get samples and
then get pizza and the leaf so when we
were there I saw this set and I really
wanted it I told him I was like that'd
be a perfect gift for me just so you
know and um it's just a bunch of hand
creams you know I would be the one who
wants a bunch of hand creams but it's a
set of a bunch of different sense this
was $35 I believe it's like a $70 value
and I love it I love it so much I'm so
excited to try them out as you can tell
one's already missing I feel like my
lips are like falling apart and sorry if
they are anyway I'm super excited for
these there are times cool sense there's
avocado Somerset meadow verbena and
lavender Summerhill Nantucket briar
gardeners there's just like a lot of
cool fun scents and I'm actually almost
out of the hand creams that I had in a
back sock so it comes at the perfect
time winter is when my hands get really
really dry and lately as you can tell
I've had no nail polish on because I've
just been picking and biting and like oh
my cuticles and they're just so dry and
like bleeding and sore so I definitely
need to put these to good use and I
really wanted to try this brands hand
creams out so I will let you know
they'll probably end up in my project
use it ups so that I'm like keeping
myself accountable and actually using
them but such an exciting gift and
something I was really surprised
together we're almost done I mean this
haul isn't like crazy big I don't think
at least but I wanted to show you guys
this stuff I picked up from colour-pop
if you watch my most recent get ready
with me then you saw me use this palette
but I did pick up the colour-pop My
Little Pony palette this is what the
inside looks like it's really really
beautiful I really like the look that I
created and I will be doing a full-on
review of this one so I've used it a
little bit more and I'll do a demo and
everything in there as well so be on the
lookout for that and I did pick up one
of the lip glosses that came in the
collection this is the My Little Pony
and colourpop lip gloss in a pony land
love this I am so glad I picked this up
I was like on the fence
like should I do it should I not it's
beautiful it's so glittery I'm super
happy with the way this looks on the
lips I kind of want to try the gold one
too
we'll see if I pick that up because
colour-pop is where my Achilles heel is
at the moment
I just love the price point I love the
shadows I love the quality I love
everything about it so when they keep
releasing all these little palettes I
just can't help myself plus with them
going in just for I'm just like please
stop because I can't control myself and
then to make sure I got free shipping I
did decide to pick up one of the bundles
these are the newer single shadows that
they've come out with I believe I don't
know it's like they collaborated with
Pantone I think I don't know if you guys
saw that on Instagram I talked about it
in a new beauty launches but anyway I
picked up the kind of more cool toned
one so there's six different shadows in
here I'm just gonna show you guys
swatches with the names next to them I
am so so happy about this one of my
favorite ones I picked up is the color
glass ball if you guys haven't seen
Jacqueline just talked about this color
and I also use it in my blood stupid for
the Kuna desert dust palette it's like
such a great duper retrospect I think
retrograde one of those I think
retrograde I really love Dragonfly it's
so pretty this black is amazing Snake
Eyes is so beautiful as well I just
really love this bundle I'm tempted to
pick up more of them I just like if I
had a ton of money I would probably
spend most of it on color pop and then
I'd try out JPS place it's like that's
where I want to spend my money at the
moment I have three more things to show
you guys and these are actually all
themed sent to me as PR from optilead
just so you guys know and I'm upfront
about it the first thing I want to show
you is this Estee Lauder bronze goddess
powder I was really excited to see this
come in the store because I haven't
really tried that much from Estee Lauder
or Lancome I think it's cool that some
really iconic brands are in there so
this is what the powder looks like it's
absolutely massive it's very very sturdy
it's really pretty I have not used this
yet it literally came in the mail today
with my Sephora stuff and I thought you
know what I'm just gonna fill in this
haul that's what it looks like it's a
little bit dark this is shade number one
but I think it might work I don't know I
haven't tried it yet so we'll see it
also came with a little brush don't know
if I'll get any use out of that but it
did come with it so that's something I'm
excited
try out and see how it works for me okay
next is something that I got from OPI
and it was supposed to be a duo and the
picture that they showed was of like a
light mint color like this in their
regular formula but this is a light mint
color in their infinite shine formula
and this is Suzy without a paddle this
one I wasn't that surprised but it's
just a different formula than I thought
it was going to be and then the other
color in the picture was like a dark
green and you're supposed to like it's
kind of like this fall duo set um but
the color I got is this bright yellow
this is exotic birds do not tweet and
again it's in the infinite shine version
which one of them was supposed to be in
that but it was supposed to be the dark
green at least I thought but these names
match up I don't know it's all a bit
confusing because to me these colors
like you can't even pretend that any of
these are for fall not even half of
these are for fall so I don't know we'll
try these girls curse out we'll see how
they look but I thought I would show you
guys that I did pick those up just not
quite exactly what I was expecting to
get in the mail once I got them here and
the last thing that I have here is from
Clarins now I've tried a couple things
from Clarins and I have really liked the
quality of it so they had this compact
on there and this is the everlasting
compact in 103 ivory and it says
long-wearing and comfort foundation so I
thought this was a cream foundation but
it ain't it is a powder foundation so I
don't know where my brain was why I just
assumed it was a cream I'm not sure so
I'm gonna still obviously try this out
it's just way different than what I
thought I don't even know I think when I
was like riding in why I wanted to try
it I was like I love cream foundation so
I don't know why I got picked for it
still I kind of like the packaging
though it's a little bit different how
it like opens up and everything I don't
know we'll see how it performs though
and that's everything for my haul let me
know if you guys want any more in-depth
reviews definitely look out for get
ready with me that's where I like to
kind of show you guys and let you guys
know thoughts if I don't do something
that's like a specific review video I
also owe you guys a haul in retrospect
for my last haul and one will be coming
up on
stuff at some point as well so stay
tuned for that if you want reviews later
on once i've tested these products and
that's everything thank you so so much
for watching guys i will have an anti
haul up tomorrow so i'm sure you guys
will want to see that
and that's actually everything i will
see you guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
