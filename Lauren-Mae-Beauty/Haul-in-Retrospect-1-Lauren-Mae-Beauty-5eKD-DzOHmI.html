Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to be the first of my haul
in retrospective videos I am going to be
talking about products that I called in
the past and tell you guys my thoughts
on them a lot of the times in hauls you
don't have reviewed or anything it's
just things that are coming in a lot of
this stuff is from my PR hauls from the
past I also have some stuff that I've
called for like my makeup kit
I thought it'd be really fun to go back
and talk about these products I do want
to make these a little bit more frequent
like after my haul so that way you guys
can actually have an idea of whether I
like these products sooner rather than
later but since this is my first one I
kind of went a little bit farther back
and gave myself a little bit more time
with like my Sephora goodies that I just
got anyway it's kind of a lot of stuff
so I'm just going to get into it I have
this big old bucket here oh it's so
pretty
I will think so much so many things I
don't really like some of these things I
do really like I will leave the original
haul videos down below if you want to
check those out and I think that's it
I've been talking too much today and
just so rambling on my other videos so
I'm going to try to keep it to a minimum
in this one the first thing on my list
is carbon cocoa I did a whole review on
this so I will leave it linked down
below if you want to check out the full
in depth thing you try it you can see it
on my teeth anyway this is a charcoal
powder and it's supposed to whiten your
teeth naturally by using activated
charcoal to pull out the impurities and
stains I didn't really enjoyed this
product it just nothing that fits my
lifestyle I don't necessarily think it
doesn't work but I don't also think that
it works really well either I'm just
kind of in the middle I think it's just
kind of expensive I believe this is like
30 something dollars which is a lot of
money although it would last you a long
time just kind of not my saying the
charcoal feeling just freaks my brain
out like when I'm like you know spitting
up black gunk out of my mouth it just
spit it's not like gunky but you know
it's just not my favorite I probably
will pass this on to my mom because she
really enjoyed it I definitely think
that this works maybe for some people
but just not for me it's not my
lifestyle it's not me the next few items
I have are from my makeup kit haul so
what happens things from Bioderma
one of the products actually don't have
I just have it in my empties video and
that is the Bioderma
hydro bio serum really enjoyed it
obvious
finish it up I highly suggest it I think
it's in the twenty four thirty dollar
range which i think is really reasonable
and I do think it hydrates the skin
really really well this here is the
sebum pore refiner I've been using this
in my kit and I really do like it as
well I think it looks really good it
leaves a really nice matte feeling on
the skin it goes on nice I feel like it
works with a lot of the products that I
spent on top of it so I don't have any
of that like killing it also smells like
watermelon which is super duper weird
and it's really affordable I don't know
it's just overall really good really
been enjoying it I wish it was a bigger
container but you know that's how it
goes and then the last Bioderma thing
that i wanted to talk about was the eye
cream and this is really really nice
it's really been great putting it on my
clients and i highly suggest it it's
really affordable if you're looking for
something that is going to give a little
bit of moisture not necessarily get rid
of lines or do anything insanely
anti-aging but if you just want to have
some moisture enough some dry under eyes
this is a really nice affordable option
I really enjoy it and I will definitely
continue to repurchase some of other
things that I got in there these are
from oxalate but I have some products
from Lancome I've used these a little
bit more these are the absolute powders
I have the shade absolute golden and
also the shade absolute peach now in
that video I was talking about how these
are very shimmery and they are quite
shimmering I really feel like these are
for people with really dry skin or maybe
someone who wants to have a very glowy
everyday look but I do think that there
are nice quality if that makes sense
they have a place in my kit but I
definitely don't use them on everyone I
would never use them on set for a movie
or anything just because you don't
really want a lot of shimmer you mostly
want matte things but for editorial I
think it'd be really really beautiful
for weddings I think it could look
really really luminous and beautiful so
I think that there's a place for it I
can definitely see what people like
these powders they are really nice
they're just definitely not going to be
for everyone and if you or someone who
really doesn't like to have a lot of
shine like all over the face I don't
think these are for you but I do think
they have a place and they're really
nice sorry these are kind of boring
reviews or I'm like some people will
like them and some people don't but
sometimes products are like that
and they're not super polarizing not
like oh I hate it I'd rather kill myself
and they're also not like these are the
best things ever I'd kill myself to have
it so sometimes it's just in the middle
it's like I'll just stay alive and maybe
use it sometimes my analogies are
getting crazy tonight is that even an
analogy I'm not sure and the other
product that it has by Lancome I am in
love with now I don't think you need all
of these these are the color correctors
these are the tint idol ultra wear
camouflage correctors i don't
particularly love the green and i just
in general don't love green for
correcting redness I know that it's
across right on the color wheel and I
know that it does help but these are
very concentrated and a little bit of it
goes a long way and when you're working
on camera you don't want to see any
Breen come through and this is just not
a natural color that you really see on
the skin I don't know it's just not my
favorite my few really love green
concealers you would just wash you the
rest your life purple I never use but
these ones these are what I'm talking
about I love the yellow I love this
peach color and then this is great for
darker skin tones
but I mean if you had to pick one I
probably tell you to get the peach one
so good for under-eye circles
I need the tiniest amount of this it
really does knock them away and I can
just put stuff on top of it and it looks
so good
these are sick like I said to be very
very careful I like to send this out
with 2:44 which is a silicone Center
that really helps to if I maybe get too
much on my fresh or whatever but I can
make these work without that I really do
like these these are great for my kid I
love the packaging they are when just
like I was hoping they would be and
again if you're just buying them for
personal use I would just buy the one
that works for you I suggest the yellow
or the peach if your like lighter skin
tone and if you're darker and worried
about like dark spots I think that the
what is it orange red is really nice as
well I have some inner products to talk
about this is their cream compact and I
was just cheap and didn't get like the
full on packaging but I have used quite
a bit of it I've hit pan if you can't
tell and I do really like this
foundation this is not going to keep you
matte throughout the day but you guys
know that I've been into a more glowy
look I'm okay with my foundation not
breaking down but letting oil seep
through throughout the day because I
find that it's a better look than being
kicked up and tachi and having your
tongue
should break down some places and not
others like that is not a cute look this
is really beautiful if you have dry skin
I think it'd be so good it's so just
creamy and just beautiful it looks like
skin which I love I just feel like so
many people could really like this it's
easy to use and it's going to make you
look great I have these shade light to
Mont Blanc and I do like this I feel
like it's a little bit cool for my skin
tone which I don't love you tend to go
neutral or a little bit warmer but I
still like this I just probably would
pick a bit of a different shade next
time I think I don't know it probably
matches me really well but I just don't
really like looking super pink but
formula it's super good so I never hear
it talked about if you were wondering
about it or want to try something new I
highly suggest it and then I picked up
two of their Velvet Matte concealers
we'll see soft matte complete concealers
I have the shade 1.5 medium and 2.5
chestnut now I picked up darker shades
and I kind of regret that I wish that
this was a lighter shade I do think that
medium 2.5 macadamia is pretty good as
you can tell I have used it I think the
packaging is just like the biggest
downfall when I'm on set I just don't
reach for these I really love the doe
foot applicator I use the NARS radiant
creamy all the time so easy to use
obviously I have to be careful about the
dope but I don't just go into someone's
skin but it's just easy to put a little
bit of that on my sanitized pan and
touch people up really really fast
whereas this I have to like I had to
take off the lid set it somewhere and
then get something to dig into this and
keep this sanitary and whatnot but
product wise it is absolutely beautiful
I just wish I got different shades I
wish it was a different packaging I'm
going to try to use this more because I
don't want these to go to waste and but
if you're using a personally I do
suggest it I think it's a really pretty
formula does leave a nice soft matte
finish you don't need a lot of it and it
looks really good I like it on the under
I think it looks like I wanted to bring
up some math items and the first one
here is the oil control lotion now I was
really excited about this I have it in
my kit and I took it out of my kit and
put it in my personal collection
because I really wasn't reaching for it
and I'm
this won't ever go back into my kit I do
like to smell of it I don't think it
controls oil I think that I don't know I
don't know I think it's a nice lotion I
just don't think that it's an oil
control lotion this small size is like
twelve dollars or so which i think is
pretty fair I'm glad I got the small
size didn't go for the large it's nice
don't get me wrong I'm just not like
obsesses it and I was kind of hoping I
would be another Mac item that I got in
that Hall are the mac fix+ now this is
the fix plus small size and coconuts and
I hate this you guys know that if you
watch my empties video I hate hate the
small understand I love smell of coconut
its my favorite scent it smells so
freakin good but this one just was so
disappointing I hated smell of it I
don't even feel like it really smelt
like coconut it was gross I definitely
do not suggest it and honestly I don't
really suggest the travel-size like
maybe buy it wants to have the container
and then you can refill it but just go
for the big one you get so much more in
it this one is three point four and this
is only one fluid ounce and this is 20
and this is ten show you didn't matter
but regular fix plus I love it's so nice
I love using this as a prep spray for my
clients on set if I feel like someone's
looking a little powdery I can use it if
I feel like they just need some
hydration that pick-me-up smelled nice
it's just such a great one to have on
set so I like the regular I hate that
coconut one and last for Mac I thought I
would bring these back up so kind of
what I was going through was trying to
pick items that I felt like I hadn't
really talked about after the haul or
things that I just wanted to mention to
you whether I like them or didn't and
these are the next two nesting face
colors I have the shade medium light and
dark I just got something kind of in
every range so I could mix and match and
whatnot these are a very balmy light
consistency and I think that they are
beautiful I think the texture is really
awesome your zone who doesn't like a
light coverage you probably won't like
this this has a very strange consistency
but it feels so good don't get around I
love it
it definitely looks nice a glowy it
definitely looks next to nothing on the
skin but I don't think that they're
maybe the best thing for my kit when I'm
doing film and TV they just leave a
little bit too much glow on the skin and
what
two shiny lights being on someone's face
they just don't translate well I did use
these for a film and it worked it they
looked great don't get me wrong but just
from now on I probably wouldn't not
going to make it look bad in that one
but it's just I'm realizing I like
something a little bit more matte I do
like the HD foundations from make it
forever better I think they're just
better all around for your kid but these
would look absolutely beautiful on like
the right clients the right situations I
do think they're still really nice for
personal use whatever they're not really
working how I wanted them to as like an
everyday staple in my kit which is a
little bit sad but I do still think
they're a good product but it's not
going to be for everyone they just kind
of pill up sometimes - I don't know if
it's the oil control price it's the oil
control lotion with this just doesn't
work I think that might be it I don't
know but like there's definitely like
little dots on my hand from it that's
like another issue but I didn't get that
all the time so I don't know I just need
to experiment more but I don't also like
to do that on set because I need to like
get my job done and move on and make
sure it looks as good as possible as
fast as possible I hope that was an
adequate review on that we're getting
close we're getting to the bottom of the
basket okay next I wanted to revisit my
scent bird now I do like scent bird as a
subscription box I haven't paid for it
before I've had it sent to me twice
which I think it's a great service
though it's perfume as one of your
things you really love 15 dollars a
month is a good price and you can get
some really cool fragrances the
fragrance I chose this time was the Coco
fig from Kampf your food Pacifique and I
was really excited about this
I have little mini bottles used to sell
us at my old work blah blah blah smell
the coconut and fig two of my absolute
favorite scents and when I smell it it
still smells good but it really does
smell like the petite dry shampoo and
tropical and I think something about
that makes this hard to use because I
just feel like it's a little cheap and I
know this perfume is very expensive so I
don't really like this I definitely
suggest out of the two since I had the
other one which was the mounting guest
Maru
Moroccan say they think that one smells
a little bit clean had just a different
feeling to it this one is just a little
too heavy
coconut sake for me now that I'm using
more and more of it and more frequently
so that was a little disappointing that
overall I didn't like it but I am glad
that I didn't buy the bottle and again
that's why I think Stepford is such a
great service you can figure that out
without you know spending one hundred
and fifty dollars on a perfume alright
continuing on I have a shampoo and
conditioner here now I am almost done
with the shampoo and I quite a bit of
the conditioner less this is the vibrant
sexy hair sulfate free color lock
conditioner and shampoo I was excited to
try these products out because I have
colored hair and I thought I can keep my
color longer that's always the goal I
hate that my pink fade so fast but these
four color didn't really do that much
for me I usually use a sulfate-free
shampoo and conditioner though so I
think that might be part of it I think
that's why it it amazed me it's like I
already use those products so I don't
think this does anything more than a
regular sulfate free shampoo would do in
keeping your color but I really did like
the shampoo this has rose and almond oil
in it I think the smell of it's pretty
dang nice I was kind of worried that it
might be a little overpowering but I do
like it this is a really nice shampoo
for me because my hair tends to get
super tingly doesn't matter I know I
only have four hairs but they all get
tangled together and this does not make
it tingly when I rinse this out of my
hair my hair feels smooth and soft I
don't even feel like I need conditioner
which is awesome because again I has
been fine hair and product built up so
easily I get greasy really fast so I do
really like this I think it was really
nice I don't know if I'm going to
repurchase it but this was really good
the conditioner on the other hand is not
good I feel like this tangled my hair
it's not very moisturizing it's just not
that good so I don't know it's kind of
weird that I like one and just like hate
the other one I'd only do opposite
things at what I'm used to shampoos and
conditioners doing it's so strange but
the shampoo you're going to get one just
get the shampoo index game haul where it
hauled those I halt this Sol de Janeiro
Brazilian foreplay moisturizing shower
gel cream I am love this it's so good
this is my favorite video so you guys
turn already now but if I can get the
chance to talk about these parts
we'll plus I love the packaging it's so
fun and bright I love yellow pink and
yellow favorite colors I think they're
so fun yellow is my favorite color
like I love pink so I love them both
hello um oh it smells so good to me I
love using this miss shower do I think
it's worth $18 I don't know it's not I
mean the product itself is not but what
I pay for it
oh maybe yeah for special occasions
definitely I think it's just so good
really really like this and in my recent
Sephora haul I even bought some products
from them this is the Brazilian crushed
spray it smells exactly like this it's
not like the lip butter smells so good I
just really like these products I think
that they're fun I think they're
overpriced but I'm willing to pay
because I really do like them there's
something about them that makes me feel
good I want to use them I love the way
they look like they are the whole
package for me and so for me price-wise
I'd rather have this and like 10 other
crappy little things I don't like
last thing guys we made it to the end I
know this is a long video thanks for
hanging in there the last thing I want
to talk about with a brush from Real
Techniques I did a whole first
impressions with this brush this is
their pointed L brush and this is a part
of their multi tech collection so these
are brushes that have a specific you
know cut to them but that doesn't mean
that they have a specific use you can
use them for so many different things if
you want to use it for foundations or CC
creams you can if you want to use it for
bronzer or blush or whatever highlighter
the cut is supposed to be kind of
universal to do a bunch of different
tasks now in the first impressions I
really enjoyed this and I do I really do
like this product you can check that
video out if you want to know how it
works for all the different things
because I use this one brush for like
basically my entire face but how I like
to use it now is basically just for
bronzer I think it works best for
bronzer it's how I've been bronzing my
face basically friends I got it
I think it's really really good I love
Real Techniques brushes I've been using
around before forever since they came
out I think that they're so good I use
them in my kit and really love them so
this was a novice appointment this was
really great and I use it basically
every day when I do my makeup it's good
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know if these are things
you want to see I just think it's nice
to revisit some products especially
these ones a lot of them were pl
again and it's good to come back talk
about things you didn't just see it one
time and never see it again that's it
I'm done talking for the night I hope
you have a wonderful day and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
