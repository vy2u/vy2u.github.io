Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna do another haul in
retrospect I will leave my other one
link down below but today we're gonna be
going over all the colour-pop stuff I
brought in recently I just thought I
would kind of review everything that I
bought in one place I have a couple
specific videos on these things so I
will leave those link down below as well
but I thought overall I would just kind
of come back let you know what I think
and just see if these are some good
purchases kind of reflect on them and
whatnot I'm gonna start off with the
item you've probably seen the most on my
channel this is the color pop brow
pencil in taupe taupe I do really like
this I have it in my brows in the outer
half today I think this is a nice pencil
for five dollars it's pretty good I
haven't run out of it yet which I'm
surprised I really thought that I'd be
done with this sooner since I have been
using it so much I think they are coming
out with some new brow products so I'm
excited to see how those work and tests
out against this but I would repurchase
I'm not like itching to repurchase it
but I did think it was nice I did
purchase both of their smaller palettes
that that came out with recently the
first one I got was the yesplease
palette and I think I have some type of
video on this I will leave it linked
down below I use this today you might
get ready with me if you want to see how
it is in action I will leave that link
down below I really like this palette I
think it's really pretty I love all the
different finishes I love all the
different colors I think the quality is
really really nice some of them are a
bit more chunky so like this gold is
definitely chunky this gold is like a
duochrome and can be a little chunky but
overall I think it's a really nice
palette especially for the price it was
only 16 dollars if you can't tell mine's
really dirty so I've definitely gotten
some great use out of it I've also been
using this in my kit which has been
really nice to my favorite shades from
this would be this dark brown it's so so
pretty I really love that I love these
two oranges shades I love that it has a
matte cream so there's just a lot to
love in this palette and I highly
suggest it if you can get your hands on
it when the restock happens I feel like
they're gonna keep restocking it for a
while and then the other one that I have
is the fan morosa or she' palette from
Karrueche and color pop this one is
really pretty as well I have a full on
review on this again it'll be linked I
just definitely don't love this as my
I love the yesplease palette this one
has some really pretty colors in it if
you're more inclined to the rosy purples
and pinks and stuff maybe this would be
better for you but I just find that
every row kind of looks similar like all
of these look very similar on my eyes so
I really would only need one or two of
them same with these even though they
look different I feel like they kind of
look similar on the eye so I feel like I
can really only get one look with this
palette whereas with this palette I can
do so much so that's just something to
keep in mind I'm not saying it's bad
it's just definitely different and I'm
happy to have it I love these small
compact little palettes I cannot wait
for them to come out with more I think
it's so cute to have like a pocket idea
and Muse in one little area overall
really high thoughts on these I also
picked up one of their big magnetic
palettes and some single shadows so I've
lots of different singles in here I
don't want to go over all one by one and
tell you what I love and water don't I
feel like it's just gonna get a little
bit long so I will leave all of the
colors that I have in this palette
listed down below and linked so you guys
can easily find them if you want them
let me just start off with the magnetic
palette I do like the palette I love
that it fits 24 I shadow is evenly in
here but again kind of like with the
other ones they just get dirty so fast
like mine looks very very beat-up and I
don't feel like I've used this that much
like you know so that's just kind of a
downside to me I wish they would fix
that I do like the feel of the
rubberized kind of packaging but it just
gets so dirty so it's kind of a downside
to me out of all these colors I do have
some favorites I really like this one
here high-strung is beautiful so so
beautiful it's one I highly suggest it's
a really pretty metallic I also do like
the color board shorts which is a bronze
color again so so pretty those two are
some of my top
I love little boat I love sea stars
basically the whole summer collection I
really really enjoyed and then the other
one that I really like is this pink one
here this one is called sand bar and
it's really pretty it is very similar to
my Urban Decay electric palette savage
it's just not quite as light and bright
it's a little bit deeper but for the
purposes of a pink it's still really
nice if you wanted to get a hot pink it
does stain a bit but so does the urban
decay one so I feel like they're pretty
comparable in that way some colors I
don't like I don't like the color ready
or yacht it's just not my favorite
there's nothing special about it it's
kind of powdery I don't suggest that and
I do think that's from this summer one
so that one's a bus don't get that one I
also don't really like Tiki it's just a
little powdery I feel like the
pigmentation could be better
you could definitely could make it work
don't get me wrong it's just not as nice
as the yellow from the yesplease palette
so keep that in mind but overall I
really do like the shadows from
colour-pop
I think they're really good and I kept
them at four dollars for a long time now
so you know snatch them up while they're
at four dollars definitely that's a good
price I did pick up an eye liner with my
kuchi color pop palette this is the
color exit and it's a white it's super
pigmented but these things oh yeah
oh shoot this has cracked on me so it
first cracked at the base and I was like
that's sucky but it's only five dollars
so I just kind of stuck it back in it
didn't fall out or anything and I was
like well I'll still make it work then I
got this out took the cap off and half
of the pencil went flying so they just
break off and in my comment section so
many of you guys have told me they've
broken off so not a white I suggest not
a liner formula I suggest unless you're
getting a really cool color I don't know
I mean I would say that maybe it's just
my experience with this one but everyone
else has told me that they break off so
that is kind of sucky I hope they
reformulated and then last I just have
some lip products so the first ones were
lip glosses this one is in the color
bestie and this one is curvy I've
already talked about these inner
products I regret buying whoa
goop city oh these are just more goopy
than the original one that I had in
finders-keepers which I really do like I
know that there are more opaque which is
nice the colors are just a little too
warm for me I just was disappointed
they're not what I want them to be I
don't think the formulas that great it's
definitely not the same as the other one
there's just so much about these
I'm not a fan of so I'm gonna keep them
still and try and then maybe make them
work maybe at a different point in my
life and what I'm into I'll fall in love
but at the moment I don't suggest them
it probably won't be buying any more lip
glosses I got two little free colour-pop
lippie stix these are in the color
thistle and the color gold digger again
these are just really warm nudes they'd
look great with the lip glosses but I
find that since these are both so opaque
you really don't need both I don't like
having goopy lips so I definitely like
gold digger better it's the darker of
the two I'm just not a huge fan of the
colour-pop lippie stix formula I used to
think I was but they're just kind of
creamy and goopy I want to try the matte
X before I just totally you know decided
I don't like them but yeah they're just
not my favorite last my voice is almost
gonna give out this is a blotted lip and
I do really like this this is in the
color DejaVu and I just love this one so
much I know it looks warm like the rest
but it definitely is a bit cooler and I
love that it's not super opaque it looks
really good on the lips so this one I do
suggest I think it's really nice I would
probably pick up some more of the
blotted lip color it's just more my
speed it's a little bit more sheer which
is something I like and out of all those
lip products it's definitely my favorite
alright guys that is everything thank
you so so much for watching I hope you
guys enjoyed this haul in retrospect I
know a lot of you guys said you liked it
in the last one so I will continue to do
them and that's everything bye guys I'll
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
