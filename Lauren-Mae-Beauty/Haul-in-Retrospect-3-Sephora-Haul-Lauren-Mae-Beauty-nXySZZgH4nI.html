Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna do a haul in
retrospect this is where I look back on
some items that I hauled in the past and
let you guys know what my thoughts are
about them after I've used them a little
bit it's just a way to make sure that
I'm using my stuff and that I'm coming
back and giving you a review past a
first impression or past just hauling
something so this is going to be going
back to my Sephora haul I will leave the
original haul link down below so you
guys can check it out if you want to so
yeah I'm just gonna get into it like
guys now my thoughts first off I have
this buxom lip pencil in the color San
Francisco I bought this because I have
other ones from this line that I really
do like and I do like it it's a nice
color it's not my favorite I love dolly
so much more but I will get good use out
of this I'm hoping that in the fall time
I can use it a little bit more it pulls
a little bit pink on me a little bit too
rosy for my preference but I think the
more I use this the more I will like it
and we all know hi I'm with lip products
so sometimes it just takes me a little
bit longer to really get on board so I'm
not gonna return this I'm going to keep
it and I do love the formula of it just
on my skin tone it's not my favorite at
the moment I'll just talk about lip
products and get them over with the next
one is this gloss from bareMinerals I
talked about in that video that I didn't
really like this that I like the anasazi
ones better than this but the more that
I've used this more I liked it it was in
a favorites video so I think that goes
to show you that just a first impression
isn't necessarily enough things can
change in your collection as you use
them so that's the color there again
this isn't any colored sugar if I didn't
mention it I do really like these
glasses I think it's nice it's in
between it's not too sticky it's not too
thin or not sticky so it has some good
wear time on it it's nice I like wearing
it alone I like wearing it with just a
lip liner
it also looks good topped over things so
I think this is a nice gloss I would
potentially pick up other ones but I'd
want to swatch them in the store just to
make sure I'm getting the right color I
still really like the anasazi ones but I
do like this one as well and if you were
looking into them I do think they're
nice the last lip product that I picked
up is this one from NARS this is a
and your point perk or something this is
in the color let's go crazy I wore this
in my 10,000 subscriber like Instagram
picture that I had I was wearing this
color I also have it in an older video
as well it's a really pretty color glad
I have it I love lip products in this
pencil form this is part of the Velvet
Matte collection too so I love that it's
matte so I really do like this it's a
fun color and I'm glad to have it in my
collection it's not something I would
necessarily buy but it's fun to have an
option of it next I'm going to talk
about bronzers I picked up two different
ones this one is from benefit and it's
the hoola light I decided to pick this
up because if you guys can't tell I feel
like bronzer is the one thing that I can
either go like ham on and go crazy and
it doesn't look that good or some men's
looks really nice so I thought this
would be a nice one that wouldn't be too
dark on my skin and I do really like it
it's not too dark but it shows up just
enough and I don't like to really
contour too heavily you can't even
really see it on my hand but on the face
it's just subtle enough to look really
nice so I do really like this it does
have a bit of like a yellow tone to it
instead of something to oranjee which
does look good because I do have a more
yellow tone to my face so I like this
I'm glad I picked it up the other
bronzer I picked up is a cream one from
milk makeup this is in the color baked
there are two different shades of this
and this I also really really like this
was in a favorites video it's so creamy
and it blends out so nicely someone
mentioned in a comment that this has a
smell it does have a bit of a smell it's
not my favorite but it's not like so
overpowering I wouldn't use it this is
just the perfect color it blends so easy
and it just looks so natural and that's
what I really like about it I know cream
products can be a little bit scary and
this one just is perfect I don't think
you're gonna get too much product you're
gonna be able to blend it out it looks
natural it's everything I feel like a
cream bronzer should be and I really
really love it so I'm so happy to pick
that up and it's a great addition to my
collection let's talk about some
products that I returned I did return
the Sephora blushes I bought three of
the mineralized baked blushes from the
support brand one of them like the top
would not open a
ended up falling out of my hand breaking
on the floor and then the other two just
weren't the colors that looked like they
were on line so I returned all of them
my Sephora was actually really great
about it they didn't say anything to me
they actually didn't even ask anything
like why I wanted to return it they just
did the return no questions asked which
was amazing so I did return those and
the other product that I did return was
the it cosmetics CC cream eye coffee
color light and I got it in like the
trial size because I just wanted to see
if it would work for me before I
invested in the full size because it is
an expensive product but the light was
just too dark and they don't have a fair
in the smaller size so I just ended up
returning it and getting a gift card so
I could buy other stuff later I just
knew it wasn't gonna work in my
collection and I really didn't want to
have to mix it like the whole point of
it to me was like I wanted to try that
formula not mix it with other things so
those are all gone and I did return them
just so you guys know next is something
I've talked about a ton of my channel
this is the Brazilian crush body
fragrance mist this is in the like
caramel and pistachio scent it's like
their most famous on that everything's
in I love this you guys know I made a
whole video about sol de janeiro if you
guys want to check it out it'll be
linked down below this is just nice I'm
not someone that's huge on body
fragrance mists but this one is great
and I love having it in my purse I feel
like the scent stays with me a really
long time I can smell this on shirts
that I like reput on later and it still
has a smell to it it also works really
nicely with the body wash so I do really
like that I'm happy I picked it up this
is the small size by the way and I do
suggest the smaller size because this is
still huge I feel like I mostly liked
everything I picked up unless I returned
it which is nice you know it's a good
thing next is a stamp from milk this is
in the heart shape and I talked about
how this does tend to bleed a little bit
and it it does bleed a little bit I find
with a powdered face it doesn't bleed as
much but this is unique enough and I
think it works well enough to keep in my
collection I think it's really fun I did
do like kind of like a really intense
look if I can remember which video I did
that in I will leave a link down below
just you guys can see the look on my
Instagram you
see me have this on I used it as like a
kind of like a heart-shaped mole it was
really cool I don't know I really liked
it something a little bit different I
definitely want to get some more use out
of this though because I've only used it
that one time really but I think it'd be
really cool to do like a pink look with
like these underneath the eyes that's
something I was kind of thinking about
doing I'm just going to talk about these
deluxe size samples that I got this is
the TARDIS pro glow highlighter and I
think it's just in it's in this shade
stunner this is pretty but this is
glittery if you like a glitter highlight
then this is for you
I'm really glad I got this in a small
size because I I would never purchase
this first up I just got it because it
was a hundred point perk it's nice to
have for like a specific look I guess
but I don't think this is something that
most people would wear in their everyday
the fact that it's cream already like
narrows the people that would actually
use this and then the fact that it's so
glittery it's not my favorite I was
thinking about doing a series on my
channel called is it crap because this
has a pretty low rating on Sephora's
website and so I'd like to maybe review
some products that have really low
ratings and let you guys know what my
thoughts are I'm not sure if I'm gonna
do that but that was just an idea I had
but this is okay I just think you have
to know what you're getting with it and
have intended uses in mind for it I
don't think it performs badly it's just
not gonna be everyone's cup of tea I
think that's the best way to describe it
and the last website sample I'm going to
talk about this is from cover effects
it's the blurring primer I really like
this this reminds me of benefits
professional it has that like skin tone
type of feel and look to it it's really
nice I feel like it controls my oil
really well and gives me a nice smooth
base that is a bit mattifying but
doesn't dry out my skin that's something
I'm having a bit of a problem with some
of my other primers I'm just liking
something that is more moisturizing or
has a bit of a slip to it so that my
foundation can go on just smoother
instead of stuff that just mattifies me
and drives me out because then I feel
like it can't put anything on top of
that without it looking kind of cakey or
just just noticeable on my skin alright
next we're going to talk about the lash
- to go that I picked up this is a kit
that Sephora puts together and it's a
bunch of different mascaras what's so
cool about this is that you
all these deluxe sized minis and then
you get to take your coupon and bring it
in and pick out the full size that you
want well guess what I freaking threw it
away because I threw the packaging away
and I feel so stupid and I'm so upset
about it because that's the whole point
I even bought this anyway so that's
really sucky I mean at least I have all
the deluxe examples it's not the end of
the world things could be worse but guys
just so disappointing like when I
realized Lauren holy crap you throw away
the certificate I was so upset it was
like long gone to it well there was no
way I was gonna be able to like dig
through the trash and find that thing so
I've been using the perversion mascara
from that set and I absolutely loved it
so good this is what I would have
probably got the full size in if I could
redeem it but we'll get over it we'll
get over it one day and it'll be fine so
I do really like that I have used the
Tarte one once or twice and it's okay
it's on like my favorite I definitely
prefer the perversion and then the rest
of the ones in here I still have not
used yet just so I don't have too many
open at once and I believe this is the
last item we're going to be talking
about this is the Too Faced natural
matte palette now this looks like a
really boring palette then it kind of is
but I kind of love it I love the mattes
I think they blend out really nicely
I've been using this in my kit as well
as on myself and I think it's really
nice I wish there was just a deeper tone
in here I feel like these don't go deep
enough and then they could have expanded
the range that's like a complaint I
guess I have but overall I do think it's
nice I'm gonna get great use out of it
it's nice to have so many just great
mattes I love that you get a ton of this
matte cream shade because I go through
those so much this is a really nice
peachy color I don't know I really like
it it's not gonna be for everyone you
definitely don't need it but I like that
I could just bring this with me and I
could create so many different eye looks
you can just do so many things with
matte neutral powders and that is
everything for my rehaul guys mostly
everything worked out and if it didn't I
returned it I'm really proud about that
let me know if you tried any of these
things down below and that's everything
thank you so so much for watching and I
will see in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
