Lauren and thank you so so much for
watching today's gonna be a haul in
retrospect this is a series on my
channel where I go back to hauls that
I've done in the past and I kind of just
update you guys let you know what I
think about those products and give you
some review see if I actually liked it
if I do it if I regret these purchases
or not yeah and that's kind of it so
let's just get into it because it's kind
of a long one and I don't want this
video to be too too long I'm gonna leave
the original haul video link down below
so you guys can check that out yeah
which is kind of a collective haul with
a bunch of different stuff in it so
let's just get started I'm gonna show
you guys the colour-pop stuff first
because we all know colour-pop is my
freakin life I feel like um the first
thing that I talked about in that video
was the color pop I think I love you
pallet now this is something I wasn't
sure if I wanted to pick up originally
and then I was just like I'm gonna do it
so I made the order and this is what it
looks like if you want like swatches and
everything of these products I did do
that in the original haul and I will not
be doing them in this one so go check
out that video if you want them I'm
sorry I'm just kind of being lazy I
don't want to film inserts I'm sorry I'm
being honest with you guys I'm trying to
keep it 100 and also I have a whole
video dedicated to this like a whole
review so check that out there's like a
demo and swatches and it's like a whole
little thing but in short I really do
like this palette I'm really glad I
picked it up is it something like
totally crazy and new definitely not I
mean these are just like neutral shades
there are some nice matte it's not too
many mattes there's four Matt's
technically this one does have a little
bit of glitter but it performs as a
matte for me and then the rest are just
like really pretty shiny metallic wood
shaped and I really like it the black in
here is really really nice I used it for
my Halloween look like I'm very happy
with this palette I'm glad I picked it
up I think it's really cute
I think the quality's nice so that is a
win I did pick up a couple more things
because I wanted to get free shipping of
course um so next I have a blending
brush here this is just their I think
it's just called the tapered blending
brush I picked this up because I was
hoping it would be a dupe for my e-40
from Sigma it's not but it's still nice
I still like it it's just a bit more
dense so it doesn't work the same way
for me but I do really like it
definitely use it and it's a nice one to
my collection I love fluffy blending
brushes I find that I use this for like
a secondary color in the crease or
transition not my initial like you know
lightest shade I also picked up a brow
product from colour-pop this is their
newer brow bus blonde pencil I like this
but I feel like the color blonde is a
little bit light I feel like I'm doing a
lot of work for them to be like very
very light brows and I do like them a
little bit more defined so that is
something I wish I got the color taupe
or I wish there was a color taupe I
don't even think there is one so for
that reason I do like the original brow
pencil better than this one but it's
still nice I do like the formula this is
definitely more similar to like an
honest Asya pencil where it's like a bit
hard and waxy whereas the other brow
product is definitely a bit more creamy
and that can sometimes be hard to work
with especially if you're used to
something more like this so I do like
this I just don't think I would purchase
it again unless it was in a darker color
and the last thing that I have from
colour-pop is just a single shadow this
is the color salt water and it's pretty
I think it's a pretty shade it's kind of
a like orange e copper gold color I
don't think I needed this if I could go
back I'd probably pick basically any
other color but this color um but I
don't like 100% regret it it's just like
nothing like unique or interesting to my
collection I feel like I have this
shadow in other like color palettes and
whatnot so yeah if you have a lot of the
other color pop palettes I don't think
you need this one
I suggest like the maths or I suggest
glass bowl which I guess it's called
glass bowl not glass ball so I'm sorry
if I've led you astray on that I was
realizing it when I was like looking it
up I was like oh wow I've been calling
it glass ball this whole time but it's
glass bowl so those are all the
colour-pop items I picked up I feel like
that's pretty successful I do like
everything I have I think I'll use it
and use it up and the even the single
shadow which is probably the thing I
regret the most is useful for my let
stupids and whatnot so in its good
quality so I'm not like upset with
a big portion of this hall was a big
Sephora order that I had placed I know I
had some gift cards from oculi so I know
that's why it was such a massive order
so let's get into those items I'm just
gonna start off with like the big hunger
this is the Natasha Genoa Leela palette
and at this time the review I have on
this should be up so definitely go check
that out if you want something that's
in-depth overall I think this is a nice
palette I think it's really pretty
I don't think it's worth 129 dollars I
don't regret it in the sense that I'm
not going to return this palette I feel
like I've just used it way too much and
I do like the shadows I think they're
pretty it's just I would never purchase
this again I'm not gonna probably
purchase anything else from Latasha - no
no when it comes to eyeshadows like I've
tried it I know what I think great and I
just probably won't buy any more moving
forward so that's kind of like a
nutshell answer on that but definitely
check out again that review if you want
more in-depth on this I also have a
let's do Pitt on this palette and I'm
hoping to do a 4 looks 1 palette with
this as well so there will be a lot of
content with this guy and whatever is
that I will link down below let's talk
about something I really really really
loved that I picked up with that order
and that is the Fenton lipgloss in gloss
balm oh it's Fenty glow it's the
Frenchie gloss balm in Fenty glow no
yeah yeah I think that's how you say it
anyway I love this lip gloss so so much
I know I'm wearing like a scary lip
we'll talk about that in a second and
I'm gonna be wearing this through like
all four of the videos I'm filming so
like lord help us all let me know what
you guys think of this down below it's a
little bit out of my comfort zone but
we're rocking it we're gonna rock it
okay anyway this is something that I
would wear on an everyday basis I love
this so so much this was a my Sephora
vib sale recommendations it was in a
favorites video like you guys have
definitely seen this floating around on
my channel and I really really do love
it it's such a good lip gloss the
formula the color the way it wears the
way it feels the way it smells like
everything about this I love I love it
packaging like it's just a wind guys
it's so good
highly suggested if you are someone who
was like
a low maintenance girl likes a shiny lip
beautiful and I get a lot of compliments
when I wear that color too like just
that people are like what are you
wearing what are you waiting
it's that girl is so good well just go
in and start talking about the lip I'm
wearing I'm wearing one of the nude
sticks nude artists creators palette and
this was a set I picked up because of ls
she did a whole lip swatch video I'm
gonna leave it linked down below again
for you guys to check out and she just
sold me on this kit like I just think
these grungy colors look so good on her
and I was like you know what I'm gonna
go for it
I don't wear a lot of like crazy lips if
you've seen my declutter videos you guys
know I've declutter a lot of what I have
to so I felt like I'm gonna try these
out these are very interesting formula
because they are a crayon but they dry
down like a liquid lipstick it's crazy
comes with six different colors if you
want swatches again check out the
original video the color I'm wearing
today is Sonoran and each of these
colors was created by an influencer and
it's like their favorite color or
whatever color they wanted to create I
had never worn this color so I was like
you know what I'm gonna wear it for the
videos that I'm filming today and I feel
like it looks so different so much I
don't know how I feel about it
I think Sonoran is a very apt name it
kind of looks like dirt it kind of looks
like golden II desert II I don't know if
it's just my fair skin tone I don't know
if it's just a little too grungy from me
I kind of like it like there's a there's
the tiniest tiniest part of me that
likes it and then there's another part
that's like this is like a yellow brown
poop you puke color so why do I like it
I don't know if I do so yeah let me know
what you guys think down below don't you
mean though come on be nice to me please
but I'd love to know what you guys think
about this lip color cuz I'm definitely
on the fence about it I think it would
look nice on someone with like a deeper
skin tone maybe like a medium skin tone
or deeper anyway I've tried a lot of
these colors and I like them I think
they're nice the formula is definitely a
little bit drying I mean most matte like
liquid lipstick type things are so I
guess that's to be expected they're not
something that I wear on like an
everyday basis I just don't like that's
just not my style but I have morning
on Halloween I've worn the dark color
quite a bit probably the most out of
everything this is the color Joyce and
it's really really beautiful if you've
seen me in a dark lip this is what I was
wearing I also did a video with the
color baby Kay and this looked really
pretty as well so I am happy with this
I'm glad I picked it up something a
little bit different
I think the formula is nice and it's
nice to have like a liquid lipstick
that's kind of like easy to apply so I
do wish there were some colors that just
weren't so like muted I feel like most
of these have that like grunge tone to
them and I think it would just be fun if
there was like a like a hot pink or like
a true red or even like a darker nude
that wasn't grungy but that being said I
do still like it I don't want to return
it or anything and I do think I'll get
some good use out of them for the next
couple of years while they're in my
collection the next thing I have to talk
about is the Stila magnificent metals
glitter and glow little set that I
picked up and if I'm being honest I
haven't used these yet so I definitely
need to get on it
I can't give you any more of a review I
have used one of these on a client in
the past it was like one I bought in the
full-size but I have never used them on
myself so I do want to do that I'll
probably do like a get ready with me or
some type of tutorial or fit it in
somewhere like that so be on the lookout
for that I do like them I'm super glad
though I picked up the three pack and
not the six pack I definitely wanted the
glitter shadows and not those satin ones
so I'm super happy with that decision
thought I would just kind of reflect on
that because in the initial video I was
kind of going back and forth between
getting one or both or what not and I'm
so glad I just got the small one because
again I haven't even used these yet I
have a few little sample things so I'll
go through those really quick I've been
using the it by by under eye eye cream
at night and I have been enjoying it I
think it's nice it's a little bit
thicker it's nice I don't know if I'd
repurchase it yet I don't know but um I
definitely like the way it feels on the
under eye so that's a win because I feel
like I'm pretty picky about that and
then I have two little foundation
samples the first one here is the bare
minerals bare Pro Foundation I've tried
this a couple of times
I feel like I have a like solid opinion
on it yet one time I liked it one time I
didn't so I'm kind of on the edge here
color wise it's a little bit yellow for
me but I'm gonna give it some more goes
I'll probably use this whole little
thing up and then I'll decide what I
think about it the other one is the
Fenty Beauty Pro filter foundation I
have tried this many times and I'm just
not a fan of it it just doesn't fit what
I like right now in my life when it
comes to foundations I like something
that isn't so mad that isn't so long
wearing that isn't so like sticky to the
skin I find especially with my glasses
it tends to pick up in that area
throughout the day like five hours in I
can't like blend it out and then I'm
like missing product on my nose so it's
just kind of like a big ordeal for me so
this is not something I would spend my
money on I'm probably gonna like mix
this with other things and just try it
maybe in winter it'll be better I don't
know with different primers and try it
out but I do not recommend this I
believe that's everything for the
Sephora part of this haul so let's move
on to the items I got from Influenster
they sent me a ciate Vox box and I had
quite a few products I was excited to
try these out but if I'm being honest
all of these are kind of like lackluster
to me so the first one here is the sea
otter London dewy sticks this is the one
that kind of kills me the most I think
it's really nice in this sense that I
think you can get a really cool like
really wet glow from this and I think
it'd be really pretty for editorial
stuff or if you have super dry skin but
if you set this with a powder or if you
put this over a product I find it moves
it around so it's just kind of like a
tough one to work with I think this
would be great on someone who maybe put
like a dewy BB cream on and wants even
more of a glow or even just puts it on
bare skin like it'd be really pretty on
the shoulders on the collarbone even
though the cheekbones it on the face but
I think that means you also have to have
pretty nice skin to pull this off maybe
you could wear it on like a vacation or
something I just don't think it's like a
practical thing for a lot of people but
that doesn't mean the product is
necessarily bad it's just kind of
finicky you just have to like it's a
certain it's a product for a certain
time
now the other few products are pretty
good but they're also just like yeah
they're pretty good you know
this is the CIPA wonder wand mascara
it's okay it's nice it didn't like flake
on me the brush is okay it's kind of
hourglass shaped it's not like my
favorite ever but I don't hate it so I
will use it up and enjoy it and then the
liquid liner is the fierce flicks
I'm just black liquid liner it's a felt
tip I use this on Halloween to do my
like devil wing that I did on my eye
it's just a winged eyeliner but I was a
devil that's why I called it a devil
wing anyway it's really black it stayed
on all night it was nice I mean it's a
good I feel like you know good black
liquid liners are just becoming so
run-of-the-mill that this isn't anything
too extraordinary to me but it's nice
that it works you know that's great all
right I believe we're moving on to the
last three items in this haul and these
are all sent to me via octoly which is
like a way to get PR for influencers but
you can give your honest reviews that's
what I love about it so the first thing
I have here is a nail polish this is
from OPI and it's C colored grin and
Barrett this is a part of a collection
they did with Ulta it's one of three and
I love this color so much I love the
formula I love the way this went on the
like nail everything about this was such
a win I think part of the reason I love
this so much is it's very similar to the
Essie color go-go geisha which was from
the fall collection last year and I love
that color so this is like almost an
exact color do I love it and the
formulas great that's what I loved about
it too so I highly recommend this if you
like colors like this it's a good one
next I have a highlighter this is from
Lancome and it's the dual finish
highlighter in the shade shimmering buff
this is really really pretty mine's
quite dirty because I have been using it
a lot I do like it I think it's really
nice there's something about this
specific highlighter color wise it's
just somethings like a little bit
different about it I don't know how to
explain it it's almost like has like a
gold reflex but there's I don't know why
I feel like there's almost like a a pink
to it or something it's very subtle I
like that you can build this up on the
skin and you can make it really
like metallic if you wanted to
especially if you like what your brush
or use some fix+ on it but you can also
do something kind of subtle and pretty
as well so I have been using this I
really do like it all the stuff actually
from oxalate was a win this time so the
last products that I have here are the
melon and gets peppermint shampoo and
cilantro hair conditioner I've had these
in my shower since that haul video so
it's been a little over a month now I
love these so much I use a lot of
high-end shampoos I feel like I mostly
only use high-end shampoos it just works
out that way with my mom being a
hairdresser and I feel like we don't go
through shampoos too too fast I mean I
use shampoos up faster than conditioners
but you know like I feel like these are
small and I have like at least half of
them I have a bit left on both of these
and me and Sam we've both been using
them anyway
this would be definitely in like my top
5 shampoos and conditioners I've ever
used and I'm talking about these as a
collective group I feel like a lot of
the times I'm fine with the shampoo but
the conditioner is what always gets me
it's either like just too greasy or
waves my hair down and this one is so
nice it smells so good my hair feels
really clean but also it's like gentle
on it and it doesn't like weigh it down
I just I really really like these I
would definitely repurchase these in the
future I think they're really nice I
love the peppermint the smell of it's
like that's just like an added bonus but
the way they work in the hair is amazing
I love them alright guys that is my haul
in retrospect I hope you guys enjoyed
hearing my thoughts on these products
about a month later I will be doing
another one on some of the other things
I called recently in the future so look
forward to that I feel like I'm talking
a lot tonight I'm filming a lot of
videos so that is everything for this
one thank you so much for watching guys
I am uploading every single day in
November it's my number one goal and I'm
really excited so I hope you guys are
too I'm leaving now
thank you so much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
