learn thank you so much for watching
just a state first this is a fake
piercing I just really wanted it to go
with the lip today so that's what we're
doing I am gonna have a tutorial on this
look I did add some Renton's but I
decided to take them off for the rest of
the videos I'm filming today cuz I don't
know I just felt like they were taking
away from how beautiful this look was
and sometimes you just need to learn to
edit your own work anyway then I'll be
coming up later but today's video is
going to be a haul in retrospect this is
a series that I started so that I could
go back and look at haul videos that
I've done in the past and let you guys
know what my thoughts are after I've
tested the products a little bit longer
just kind of gives you more information
about products instead of them getting
just like lost in your drawers and never
talking about them again I can let you
know if they worked if they didn't if
they were returned or what not what
happened to them the haul I'm gonna be
showing you today is my last haul that
wasn't my most recent haul so I'm
getting caught up which is amazing I'm
gonna leave that video link down below
if you want to check it out but other
than that let's just get into the
products and I'll let you guys know what
my thoughts are now so the first thing I
talked about in that video were hand
soaps because I just bought a ton of
them from Bath and Body Works they had a
really great sale and I split the price
with my mom so I had quite a few I did
want to mention and specifically shout
out one that I had talked about because
it was in a favorites video and I loved
it
it's long gone and in the trash now but
it was the ice blue sage which was
specifically an exfoliating hand soap
from Bath and Body Works and I loved it
I loved the scent I loved the feeling
like everything about it was so nice so
if you see them have those it was in
different packaging it was almost like a
sand in it it wasn't like little beads
but I loved it it was so great I would
highly recommend it and I want to pick
up more of those if I see them so that
hand soap has been amazing moving on to
the makeup portion of the stuff I showed
the next thing I had talked about was
the BH Cosmetics zodiac palette and this
is something that I really really love I
will admittedly say that I haven't used
this nearly as much as I feel like I
should have used it in the amount of
time since at haul but I have loved
every look I've ever created with this I
think that it's such a nice palette and
for the price and think it's really
great so in the hall video that I did
hauling this I am wearing a look that I
created using this palette so I'll leave
that get ready with me link down below
to if you want to check that luck out
it was so pretty it was using like some
of the purples and the pinks and it
looked beautiful so I definitely want to
do some palate bingos and just do I
really want to do some for Lux one
palette I just am lazy and it takes a
lot of time to do for looks and get it
all together for one video but that is
something that I'm really really trying
to get for you guys just because it
pushes me to go outside my comfort zone
and do some fun things that are
different and create different eye looks
with the same palette but also for you
guys so you guys can like have ideas on
what to do I feel like these little guys
are like falling off I use just like
glitter glue but I highly suggest using
duo because if they start like falling
off my eye and just just ignore it
anyway really highly suggest this really
great especially for the price it's a
really good palette I had also picked up
the blacklight palette from BH Cosmetics
this is something I had really wanted
and honestly I think this is an OK
palette like I think it's good it's
insanely pigmented I use some of the
colors today the two pink shades on my
cheeks and I've been using Queen a lot
like the blue it's a really nice icy
blue of you stood in quite a few
tutorials so I have gotten you some of
this I think it's good
I just don't think as a highlighter
palette it really works for me it
definitely has those duochrome it's just
not subtle this is so pigmented and so
intense which I think some people would
really really love for me if I'm gonna
go do chrome on the face I like to make
it a bit more wearable I guess you could
say like I love the Kat Von D one that's
probably one of my favorite ones over
the moon child the moon child can be a
little intense but I find that you can
kind of build that up but you can also
wear it like a little bit more sheer and
it just has this little bit of a hint to
it and I really enjoy that for more
natural looks but doing something a
little bit different there's no way in
hell you can get natural with this no
matter how little and lightly you tap
your brush in it just picks up so much
product it's so pigmented it's just
intense so it has its purposes and I do
enjoy it for those purposes but when it
comes to being a highlighter on the face
it's not necessarily my favorite for it
so yeah take that as you will
doesn't mean this is a bad product I
still enjoy it I just don't like using
it for a hundred percent when it's
intended for unless I'm doing something
very specific
next I talked about some products at
amazing cosmetics had sent over so the
first one was the amazing cosmetics
illuminate primer highlighter I do enjoy
this I think it's a nice illuminator if
it was something you were looking into I
don't think that you would be
disappointed
I know nikkietutorials uses this quite a
bit and her face always looks like crazy
metallic she does use quite a bit of it
this is a very metallic like shiny
highlighter and illuminator that's
definitely how it gets its luminosity it
isn't from being like dewy and
moisturizing necessarily it definitely
leaves like a highlighter like finish on
the skin I think that if you're looking
for a glowy look it's nice it's not
overly glittery though like there aren't
glitter particles in it so that's nice I
think it's nice it's not like my
favorite one I've ever tried but I
definitely don't hate this I think it's
a good product you get a lot of product
in here yeah it's okay the other product
from amazing cosmetics I no longer have
I actually have to cluttered it I put it
in a disappointing products video and I
had already hinted in the haul video
that I didn't really like it
the few times that I tried it it just
gave me glitter fallout underneath my
eyes because that's how it was an
illuminating concealer just did not work
so yeah not for me it was too thick and
heavy on top of that even if it didn't
have the glitter issue it's just on a
texture and consistency that I enjoy so
I did end up passing that along next I
had some products from number 7 this is
the city light tinted moisturizer and
this has SPF 15 this is nice my first
impressions on this were definitely not
very good but the more I uses the more I
did like it I have been trans
more and more into lighter coverage when
it comes to my base makeup and I think
this is nice this definitely is pretty
sheer it's not as sheer as I first
thought like I feel like you can build
it up a little bit but this is
definitely gonna give you like light to
maybe medium coverage it really doesn't
give you much so if you're someone who
already has a nice skin
and you just want something moisturizing
with SPF and something to kind of like
even out some areas and then add some
concealer I think this would be nice but
if I had to pick between this and like
let's say my pur Lisse or pur Lisse a BB
cream I would choose that over it how is
just a bit more coverage and I just
enjoy it better so if you want something
super light this is nice but if you want
something more in between I would go
with a more BB cream type of thing which
has a bit more coverage but still look
super skin like on the skin I also got a
bronzer from them both of these were
sent to me from octoly this is the
bronzer in golden sand they have three
different ones I believe this is the
bronzer I'm wearing today and I have
been wearing it off and on I think it's
nice and I basically have the same
opinion I did in that haul video I think
this is a nice bronzer it's not too
light it's not too warm it's just you
know in the middle it's not my favorite
bronzer I've ever used but it's
definitely not something I dislike so I
will continue to use it in my collection
at least at the moment and enjoy it but
it's not something that I would run out
and repurchase if it broke next I showed
some things from a color pop order one
of them was the no filter concealer and
I'm sure you guys know by now that it's
not something I enjoy again it was in my
disappointing products video I don't
like the feel of that concealer I don't
like the coverage I don't like the
colors I hate that it dries down super
dark which I mentioned in another video
that a lot of my concealers I'm noticing
dry down darker and that's so irritating
I don't know what's going on and why I
never noticed that before but I think
the color pop one really sparked it off
for me and I was like whoa this is very
different I know so many people love it
though so it's a very affordable
concealer if you were thinking about
getting it I definitely think it's one
of those ones that you should just get
it try it for yourself see if it's
something that will work for you but for
me it just did not did not do what I
needed it to do I also picked up the
brow boss brow gel which was a very
strange product it was a kind
I don't even know it was almost like a
brow pomade like think of like a hair
pomade for guys that's kind of how it
was but not like gel like it all it was
like a putty almost I just did not enjoy
the way that it went into the brows if
it was colored I think I would have
liked it better this thing was like
falling oh wow all right we had a
casualty this was falling you guys you
had to tell me those sort of things
okay I'm gonna be really extra careful
and try to make sure that it doesn't
fall again I don't know how long it was
like that so forgive me if it was
colored I would have liked it better but
since it wasn't it would kind of strip
my brows from any color that was on them
and I have blonde eyebrows so I want
color I want definition just didn't work
out for me again mmm if you have like
medium colored hair it might work for
you if you want just like a really messy
like boy brow type of look but it just
didn't work out and then the only
product I have left from colour-pop that
I had mentioned in the hall is the all I
see is magic palette this is something
I've used a couple of times and I was
really excited to get but honestly I
don't use it that much it's not
something that I love more than the
other palettes that I've either
mentioned or I'm going to mention this
is definitely something that I wouldn't
say is like a full-on regret like I
think the quality is fine
it's very standard for color pop I just
think like when I look at my collection
and the things that I have this palette
doesn't inspire me as much as it did and
it could be that I'm just ready for
spring and I'm ready for brighter colors
and just doing more like fun stuff and
this is very much like a fall winter
type of palette I feel like with the
different colors in here so I don't know
if I could go back in time I would not
purchase this that doesn't make this a
bad palette it just makes it a palette I
wouldn't pick again yes I wouldn't pick
this out of all the other palettes that
I bought since this one I've used this
one probably the least the other
palettes that I was just talking about
are D hooda ones I did end up picking up
all of the mini hooda obsessions
palettes I think these are really really
nice they do retail for $27 which is
but pricey for how small these are but
you do get a lot of product in the pans
and you get nine shadow so I think
compared to her other palettes I think
it's a pretty nice price point this is
the electric obsessions it's my favorite
one the one I think you should get I
love the colors in here I think they're
very pigmented I did a whole watercolor
fun luck with this and I thought it
turned out amazing I also have been
using some of the pink and the yellow
like I just think it's great the only
color I don't really love is this orange
I wish it was more orange it turns pink
on the eye for whatever reason but other
than that I think it's great I'm highly
impressed with that palette and super
enjoy it I also find that for the times
I've used it it has not stained my
eyelids which is good the mauve
obsessions probably is my least favorite
when it comes to just color selection I
feel like you're just so trapped with
this like you have to have the same I
look over and over and over there's only
so many variations you can make I will
say that with these kind of like
glittery shades they haven't been my
favorite so far I just find them hard to
apply to the eye to get to stay and
actually look as pretty as they look
like on your finger or in the pan I will
say that I recently have purchased a NYX
glitter glue and I think that's gonna
help kind of like keep that intact and
look really nice so I'm gonna be testing
that out and see if that kind of helps
the shadows perform better but I know so
many people love him and I haven't
really heard too many complaints about
that it's just like a personal thing I
guess with me probably the one I was not
expecting to like the most but the next
favorite one that I have is this one and
this is the smoky palette mine has been
busted I don't know it just came like
crack they're just very delicate shadows
I just love this it's your classic
smokey eye I think you can do so much
with this you can get some really
classic looks and I think it's great and
then warm Brown is what you probably
already have in your collection when it
comes to color selection but I still
think this is nice I think that this did
the warm Brown better than the mob one
did where you have just more color
selection in here you can do something a
bit more peach you can do something more
like red brown orange Brown this is like
a burgundy Brown like I feel like
there's a bit bit of a difference when
it comes to tones even though they're
all warm so yeah those are my thoughts
on them I do like them if you were
thinking about picking them up I would
just pick the colors that go best for
you you
only don't need all of them it's so
crazy to see me in the monitor with this
on it like changes your face so much
like crazy
next I talked about a few items that I
picked up from Sephora because of Black
Friday I'd mentioned in that but Sephora
doesn't do like a discount for Black
Friday they just do like weird bundles
and stuff so I picked up this first day
Beauty ultra Repair Cream me and say I'm
like to use this at night we've used
quite a bit of it and it's nice I enjoy
it I think $15 is a fair price says it's
a $42 value for only 15 that's why I
picked it up I thought that was pretty
good I knew this would last a while I
like it for the $15 I just don't think I
pay 42 it's good it's basic it's simple
and I'm kind of going toward a little
bit more tailored of a skincare routine
lately so we're gonna use this up but I
don't know if I'd purchase again next I
have some roller balls from pin rose
perfumes I believe pin rose is like a
newer perfume brand to Sephora they had
a set for holiday that I picked up for
Sam's mom that I kind of wanted for
myself but I thought she'd enjoy and I
was able to try it out when she opened
it up so I really love the Sun st. from
there which didn't have that one in this
but my favorite one has been Little
Dipper and you can tell I've used it the
most this has been staying in my purse
and I love it it's so nice and fresh and
clean I really love it has almost like a
citrus ish type of scent the other two
aren't bad they're just not something
that I love I would not purchase these
this is the wild child scent this is
kind of sweet it's probably my next
favorite one and then the other one is
secret genius and this one is just kind
of like vanilla sweet maybe a little bit
of musk which isn't something that I
just love so I think these are great I'm
glad I bought it it was $15 with a set
of three of them which i think was
really good for that price it's less
than what a rollerball would probably be
but yeah I love Little Dipper the most
the next product is what inspired this
entire look today I realized when I was
coming up with all the items for this
haul I realized I never
my milk glitter stick and so I was like
you know what we're gonna make a glitter
you know kind of more ethereal look
today I think this is nice if you're
looking for a glitter stick it does what
it says it's gonna do I wanted to pick
up the mini because I knew I could never
go through a big one and I don't want to
pay the price of the full-size this is
still $14 which is still expensive but I
enjoy it it's nice I don't know I'm like
having this in my collection for the
times I want to do something glittery I
think it does it really well it's
definitely not something everyone needs
and it's kind of expensive but I enjoyed
it
the last second that I purchased from
Sephora these were in a set and this is
the Urban Decay perversion bigger better
blacker mascara I love this but sadly I
do feel like the small version is just
better like I love the travel size way
more than this so anytime I can get that
as a point perk or somehow is a sample
like I'm going to because I love the
mini of it the full size is fine it's
just definitely not as good I don't know
what it is the mini is just fricking
better it also came with the black liner
this is the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
perversion I just put this in my makeup
kit so that I could use it there I don't
use a black eyeliner too often I haven't
even been tightlining lately which is
something I used to do all the time I
just don't want gunk around my eyes
lately so I've just been using mascara
and sometimes I like to do like a brown
or something to add some definition I
just black is so harsh on my fair skin
so I think it was worth the $15 for this
for like a black liner in the mascara I
just I love the mini one I realized and
then I did get a free little item for
becoming a vib and it was a bite lip set
it came with a primer which I honestly
haven't used much so I can't even give
you really a review on it wish I could
but lip products are just the hardest
for me guys and then it also came with a
mini lipstick and a lip liner the lip
liner has been declared cuz the color
and just everything about it I don't
love this is like on its way to being
too cluttered this color I've worn in a
video and I had a couple comments saying
they liked it but it's just like a weird
coral on me this is the shade sweet
cream and it looks fine
it's just not something I love and so I
just find there's not really room for it
in my lip collection
I had a set of sample perfumes from
Sylvain Delacorte
she made a set of perfumes all inspired
by musk so they're different takes on
musk it's like a five-dollar sample set
I'll leave the link down below again not
affiliated but if you wanted to try
these out I think it's like a good price
to try out all the different things
again check out that video if you want
to see more about it I don't love Musk's
but I did decide to put these in my
perfume samples roulette video so these
are like potential options for me to
pick I haven't picked any yet but once I
do pick one of these in that video then
I will either use it up or decide if I
want it or don't like it or whatever I
will leave that link down below if you
guys haven't checked of that video out
it's just a fun way I'm trying to use up
my perfume samples because I have way
too many of them but yeah I don't know
those I got I just showed and the last
two things are things that I bought for
my makeup kit so first off here I'm
gonna show you the real creation LS dirt
this is how I make fake dirt on people I
have the 8 ounce bottle I've already
used up a 2 ounce bottle and I just
refill that this was like $24 and it's
my favorite way to dirty people up so
fast if you guys follow me on Instagram
I posted a picture of like bodies all
intertwined and I did a music video with
the artist sorrow I mentioned him
recently but I had to dirty up dancers
and him and don't get me wrong by the
end of the day he was dirty because he
was just like in a warehouse dancing
around and it was a dirty but this
helped get like that initial dirt
started it's so fast and easy it looks
great and it usually stays really well
too so I just love this I will continue
to repurchase it if you're makeup artist
you need something especially like if
you have a lot of people that you need
to get done really fast this is great
you can just spray it on I usually just
use my hands and rub it around if I want
some more texture I'll use a different
type of sponge or whatever and then I
can add powders or whatever on top of
that to add some dimension and again
texture so that's great and then I do
talk about how I got new concealers for
my kid these are the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD concealers I just love makeup
forever when it comes to makeup for my
kit I think that they do a great shade
range I think that they create really
great products for artists and for me I
think
give coverage but they're not too heavy
I do want some things sometimes that's
just a little bit more moisturizing like
I want some more moisture mixed in with
pigment and I don't see that happening
and a lot of what I've been trying like
I love the coverage but I just want
something a little bit more moisturizing
for just depending on what client and
like their skin type and how old they
are and just everything I just want that
I'm still missing it so I'm still on the
lookout for that I might just like add
some drugstore stuff that I know I that
works and you know I love and I've used
on myself time and again I might just
pick some of that up because seriously
if I love it and use it I don't care if
it's drugstore or not so anyway I do
enjoy these I'm really happy with them I
do like them better than the NARS I just
wish they were in a doe foot that's just
so much easier on set for me to like
hurry put on my sanitized Han and go
from there instead of like unscrewing
the lid and all that looks like the only
downside but yeah other than that I've
been enjoying them I'm glad I invested
in these for my kit and they work well
alright guys I hope you enjoyed this
haul in retrospect I feel like overall I
do like the items that I purchased there
are a few that I could probably do
without I just love these videos because
it makes me really take a deep hard look
at like what I bought and if it's
actually worth it for my collection and
it's helping me look at the haul that I
just made and making sure that if I
don't love something that I return it in
this band that I actually have to return
it so yeah anyway I hope you enjoyed
thank you so so much for watching guys
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
