Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I thought I would do a new haul in
retrospect it has been quite a while
since I've done one of these and going
back through my videos and seeing what I
did last the last haul that I have done
that I haven't done in Holland
retrospect for was a haircare haul so
this is all hair stuff if you ever
wondered about my hair and the products
I use a lot of them are these ones so
I'm gonna give you guys some reviews on
these products now that I've tested them
now that I have used them in a bunch of
different situations whether I'd
repurchase them if I think they're worth
it or what not so I'm gonna leave the
original video linked down below so you
can check it out in that video there
were a lot of issues I was like opening
products that were bad and yeah it was
kind of a whirlwind of stuff but anyway
just a few things about my hair I have
fine thin hair I color it so it's pink
obviously but I bleach it before that so
yeah it's just it's definitely not the
nicest hair I know you guys see my hair
in a bun all the time and that's because
that's what I feel comfortable and
confident in that's what I think looks
hella cute on me when it comes to my
hair so that's why I do that but yeah so
that's what this is focused on is just
kind of like giving my hair volume items
that are going to help give texture and
things like that so if you have any of
your favorite products though let me
know down below because some of these
didn't quite hit the mark for me the
first thing was the puff me volumizing
cloud mist now if you watched my empties
videos you guys have seen these a ton
but I love this product I was
repurchasing it in that haul video so I
think I bought like five or six of these
we've been through a couple of them
already and I suggested it's really nice
what it does is it gives your hair some
texture and a little bit of volume you
just spray it in instead of just putting
the powder straight on your hands and
into your hair which i think is so nice
it really does give you some gritty
texture I think this is great for first
day hair if you really want to build up
something so that you can put your hair
in a bun and it's not just all very thin
and like slippery this gives it some of
that like hold and texture without being
like a hairspray or something the next I
had mentioned my viral extreme hot pink
color wash this is how I
my hair and how I keep it up between
like getting it bleached blonde by my
mom I love this stuff it was in my year
favorites video I'm gonna leave that
link down below if you want to know
other products that I loved in 2017 but
I highly suggest this I think it's
amazing they have a bunch of other
colors I will say though it does dye to
your hands so be very careful like work
with this really really fast you could
also I guess wear gloves that's always
something but I love that you can use
this in the shower and it just makes it
dyeing your hair and keeping it up super
easy I did have a die in this video as
well this is the Fram color her friend
me Izzy Fram color bold in pink this is
what my mom uses to Diamond hair when
she dies at blonde she then puts this on
it and I think it works nice I really
like the color it's bright without being
too dark and it's nice I need to bring
this one back to Arizona though because
I'm not gonna use this here I just use
the color wash and that's what I suggest
I mean that's just the easiest you don't
have to like fiddle you have to fiddle
with all the other stuff it just makes
it easy the next thing I'm going to talk
about is the Paul Mitchell olive pooi
wild ginger hydro cream whip this is a
mousse that you put in your hair to give
it extra volume and this is supposed to
have frizz control and touchable hold
and I do like this product I definitely
think it could control frizz and the
reason I wanted this is because a lot of
mooses tend to make my hair crunchy and
I don't have a lot of hair so I don't
want it to be crunchy I wanted just to
have a little bit more volume but still
be nice and soft this definitely gives
it that but it doesn't have a lot of
hold so you're not gonna get as much
volume with this as you would with
another mousse so I like it but I also
don't know if I'd purchase this one
again also the scent for me the wild
ginger is definitely definitely a scent
I'm not really a fan of ginger sign so I
think that's kind of throwing me off
it's kind of manly which is nice for Sam
because he's been using this as well
it's not bad and I would not repurchase
it but I'm also not like oh my gosh I
love it I need to repurchase it when
it's gone I have quite a few Moroccan
oil products in here
one was the dry shampoo and this isn't a
light tone so I've actually already used
one up so this is a new bottle I love
this
it smells so so good I've loved batiste
for so long and I kind of switched over
to this it's expensive but because I can
get in a discount I think it's worth it
I think it's still worth it at the 27 if
it's in your price range but I do
suggest the batiste if you are on a
budget because that stuff is so
inexpensive it works so well and they
have it in the regular but also in
darker tones in case your hair is darker
and you don't want that like ashy look I
don't know anyone who like wants they
actually look but you know oh I just
smell so good the one thing this does
tend to like rotate the lid here and if
you don't have it where there's a divot
where you spray it can kind of get the
purple spray stuff everywhere but
honestly that's such a minor thing so I
wouldn't worry about it if you want to
try it it's amazing next was the
Moroccan oil and texture clay and I got
this and when I opened it up in that
video I had no idea until I opened it in
that video it had actually dried out and
I was so disappointed and so upset but
my mom did return it and now I have this
one so this one's good to go
we haven't really tested this one out so
I can't give you really any feedback yet
of whether Sam likes it or if I like it
but I'm glad to have one that actually
is usable and not you know old and
crusty the other kind of like surprised
issue in that video was this Nioxin
cleanser now this is the shampoo and in
that video I had thought I got the
conditioner instead of the shampoo but I
got the shampoo and I was gonna return
it but honestly me and Sam do like this
product and Sam uses that often so more
than anything what I need to do is just
buy the conditioner so I have this big
old shampoo still once we get the
conditioner we will be good to go I just
haven't done that yet my mom had bought
a regular set with the shampoo and
conditioner and like something else in
it for a really good price and gave it
to Sam for Christmas I think so yeah we
won't need that for a while but that's
what I need to buy next I had some AG
haircare things in there and I picked up
these too because look how beautiful
they are the packaging was just so
pretty and so tempting so this first one
here this is the toss old texture and I
think this is nice it does give a bit of
texture it's not my favorite though I
don't know I just want a texturizer that
necessarily add wetness to my hair it
just adds the texture and I think that's
why I like the texturising or volumizing
powders because they don't spray out and
then are like you know kind of what I
guess a little bit you just have to wait
a second I don't have a second I don't
have any moments I just want to get it
done but this is something I actually
liked more than the texture spray which
I didn't expect this is the dry wax and
I really like using this on second hair
or third hair days where I have quite a
bit of dry shampoo going on
so let's backtrack my hair gets really
greasy pretty fast since I don't have a
lot of it and so that's why I love to
use dry shampoos but if I use too much
dry shampoo sometimes it can look a
little powder and a little dry and it
doesn't have a piece enos to it that I
like kind of like that sweet spot of
like towards the end of first day hair
at the beginning of second day hair has
and I find that the dry wax when I spray
it on it gives that PC texture to my
hair and I really like that it just kind
of gives it a little bit of shine and a
little bit of life back instead of just
looking like a powdered mess like I'm
George Washington looks like an old
powdered wig or something so I do really
like this I have quite a bit of it I've
also been putting this in my kit and
I'll bring it along sometimes for gigs
so I really do enjoy that and I suggest
it if you're looking into it the other
AG product that I had was a dry shampoo
and I hated it it was in my
disappointing products video I'm gonna
link that down below don't suggest it
don't waste your money just get the
batiste one or the Moroccan oil one and
next all of these little items that I
have next I really wish I didn't buy
except for like a couple of them I just
think they're a waste of time and
product so I'm going to be passing on
most of these items
I just haven't reached for them I only
spent five dollars I think for all of
these so it's not like I'm out a ton of
money but I still feel wasteful in the
sense that I didn't need these items in
my house cluttering up my home someone
else could have bought these items I you
know I just wish I hadn't bought them
but I will show you them anyway these
are the defense zone number
and number three I don't know where
number two is this the top of it has a
hole in it so that's frustrating but the
reason that I did pick this up is that
it's a pre-shampoo
exfoliant and I thought that'd be nice
but this doesn't seem that exfoliating I
haven't reached for it I didn't like
that there was like product already
seeping out of it it just like it was
just a mess it's a mess next this is the
leave-in treatment haven't used it and
I'm gonna get rid of that this I guess
it's from Revlon you guys had told me in
the comments it's the unique one all in
one hair treatment and you guys said
there was quite a few uses out of this
but I've never used it and honestly my
hair doesn't need treatments I don't
need any of that crap because it's just
too much for my little hair strands so
I'm going to pass that on and then the
other thing I think I'm gonna actually
pass on this is the color proof evolved
color care card hold gel
I just haven't used it I just don't
think I'm gonna use it so yeah I'm gonna
get rid of that this is something I do
want to keep I just haven't used yet
it's this Schwarzkopf so hard to say
shiny duster velvet shine powder
I don't really know honestly what it's
about but I'm gonna try it out and then
the last thing for that haul this is the
joy Co power spray finishing hairspray
I've already moved this into my set kit
for set and makeup in here because
that's what I do and I really like it it
works nice and I love that it's in a
small container it's just nice to have
this like on the go and I can put it in
my pockets easy and all of that so I'm
glad I picked this up but all those
other little things at the end I could
have done without like you know I don't
know it's something I'm learning still I
try my best to be good and not buy a ton
of stuff but that was kind of a point of
weakness and I wish I hadn't has been
even just the $5 on it so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this rehaul and let me
know again some of your favorite
products for thin fine hair adding
volume if you have a really cool color
product that would be awesome to you
and that's everything thank you so so
much for watching guys and I will see
you in my next video
