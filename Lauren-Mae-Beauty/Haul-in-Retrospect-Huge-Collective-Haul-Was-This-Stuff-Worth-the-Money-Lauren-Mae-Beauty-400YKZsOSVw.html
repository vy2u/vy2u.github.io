Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing a haul in
retrospect this is a collective haul
that I did a while back I believe like
February 19th or February 20th so it's
been about two months since I've had
this stuff it was a pretty big haul and
it was a mix of things I had bought as
well as some PR stuff so I have some of
it here I will say there were a ton of
little samples and some things I haven't
even tried yet which who makes me feel
really bad so I'm not gonna waste my
time talking about things that I have
like the same opinion on I guess as the
original video so if anything I can come
back and do like a part two or you know
as I try to incorporate those things
into my channel and into my routines I
can update you then but I do have quite
a few of the items that I had in that
haul so we're gonna go over them I'm
gonna let you guys know how I feel some
of the stuff you have seen on my channel
already cuz I love it other things I
feel like I haven't really talked about
so I think that's enough of an intro
let's just get into it I'll leave my
Holland retrospect down below yeah let's
do it I'm gonna try my best to go in
order of the things that I showed so
when I had first hauled this stuff the
biggest thing I was excited about were
the color pop moonlight magic items this
was a new collection that had launched
it's crazy to think about how fast
things go because I know I still love
these products and I feel like I have
talked about them a lot they really
kicked off my love of liquid or like
cream shadows in this format but like no
one else talks about these things it's
pretty crazy to me anyway besides I do
have a whole video doing like a demo and
a first impression I have swatches of
these products so I'll leave that link
down below for you to check out I really
do like these products I don't think
that you need all of them I did pick up
all five of the shadows these are like a
duochrome
a holographic type of liquid eye shadow
that color pop came out with it was a
very ethereal collection the colors I
suggest are over again this is a really
beautiful pink I've used this multiple
times I love the way it looks on the
eyelid it just really pops any look just
so fun has like almost like a purple
shift to it and then probably my
favorite one is Lucky Penny now kind of
a trick with these is you don't want to
use these to add like a complete
opaqueness to the lid I find they do not
work well in that way
because these tend to have almost like a
chunkier formula so I like to Pat these
on to the eye
this is Lucky Penny which is so
beautiful if you want some really cool
swatches definitely check out that video
but I will like tap these on the eye or
apply them over already a shadow that I
put down on my lid and I find that that
works best so you don't have to use a
ton of this product the more you build
it the more texture you're gonna have
and I find the patcher they can get
because the product until it's like
completely dry can kind of lift on
itself so you know they are a little bit
finicky but I find overall the look that
you get looks so much more complicated
than it really takes to just put this on
your eyelid so I really like them I'm
really happy with this purchase
specifically with that I did buy the
three lip glosses in the collection as
well I don't know why but I can only
find two of them so I have the shades
finesse and my forte and the one I'm
missing is verbatim these are really
pretty glosses um they're definitely my
style when it comes to being kind of
like your a doesn't they have some
glitter in them and I really do enjoy
glosses did I need these definitely not
do I enjoy having them in my collection
sure but I definitely don't get as much
use out of them as I thought maybe I
would so I could have maybe passed on
these I feel like I still use tight fit
which is one of the colour-pop glosses
the most out of all the glosses from
colour-pop that I have so that's kind of
the one I suggest I use it all the time
I use it in my most recent tutorial and
my Kiko video so yeah I like these still
I'm not gonna get rid of them but they
definitely didn't need to be purchased
the next items in this haul were all
from Sephora I had made quite a few
different purchases here and there there
were a lot of things on my wish list and
as good samples came up I just kind of
would make those purchases based off the
free sample if you get the first items
that I had shown from Sephora actually
came in a set this was the Becca
jetsedder
kit I believe it came with two of the
primers as well as a mini of the
corrector my favorite item from this is
definitely the corrector I use it all
the time it looks pretty beat up in
there
I really enjoyed using this I love the
size I wish you could purchase it in
this size honestly because this is quite
a bit of product you don't need a lot of
it to get the effect that you want under
the eye I like using this with my
fingers to tap it in it doesn't have too
much opaqueness but I
I feel like it does counteract some
darkness without looking fake so highly
suggest this it's very emollient though
I don't find though that it slips around
on my face which is something I'm
worried about and then the other two
primers the first one here is the
backlight priming filter and honestly I
haven't I don't even think I've used
this oh I have it open so I have used it
a couple times I don't really have
opinions on it the first like priming
filter though I have used a ton not
necessarily this bottle but I did have a
deluxe size mini that I also had in this
haul it was like crazy it was a lot of
primers in this haul and I'm almost done
with that one I do really like this this
smells very citrusy it's really
lightweight on the skin it gives you
this glow without any like detectable
trace of shimmer you don't really know
why you're glowing
you don't feel greasy I've really
enjoyed it it's a great product overall
I think that kit was worth it it was $25
and with what I've sampled so far and
the amounts of product you get I think
it's definitely worth it so if you were
interested in those products that might
be a better way to test those items out
while saving some money the next set I
had purchased was a Beauty Blender and
to face set and it came with a big
Beauty Blender a small little micro mini
the lotion as well as in many of the
primer and honestly the only thing that
I have enough of an opinion on is the
freaking primer spray I've used up the
small one that came in that kit and
ivory purchased it so obviously I like
it if you've watched like one of my
videos in the last month you've probably
heard me talk about this product oh yeah
I really like this product it's
definitely worth it it's expensive but I
love the way it smells I love the way it
feels I'll try to stop going on and on
about it next I have some products from
the ordinary so I picked up four
different products and this is a brand
I'd really wanted to try because as you
guys know I really do like affordable
products that is something I just love I
love getting things cheap I like things
that work really well but are a great
price so I don't have to shell out 30 40
50 60 100 plus dollars for something
like I don't want to one of the items I
did return it was the caffeine eye
solution me and Sam used it for a while
I just didn't feel like I was getting
any results with it it was supposed to
get rid of any like puffiness I believe
as well as get rid of dark circles and I
was not saying
any results I know it wasn't an
expensive item but it was something that
there's no way I could have used up all
that product I didn't like the packaging
like nothing about it was working for me
and I didn't want to just not get rid of
it so I returned that item it just it
wasn't it wasn't working something I do
really like this is the glycolic acid 7%
toning solution this is something I use
after I wash my face and before I put on
a serum I've used about half the bottle
and for this product I'm gonna say up
front I'm not a skincare person I'm not
your like go-to person to know about
skincare that's not me I'm just like you
I'm probably even worse I do my best I
try to like make a routine I know some
basics but I don't know a time that
being said I do like this I feel like
it's working I do think that it's like
kind of exfoliating my skin this feels
almost bitchy on my skin when I use it I
feel like the more I use it the more I'm
getting used to it though so I don't
feel the effects as much as I did when I
first started using it but overall it's
a step that I do enjoy in my routine I
think this was like $8 so it's a good
price I will say I know there's a lot of
like weird stuff going on with the
ordinary so I don't know how I feel
about all of that so I'm not saying to
like go buy this or don't and that's
like a more recent development I feel
like then when I had purchased this
stuff in February so I don't know if
I'll repurchase this item but I am gonna
use it up and I do enjoy it another item
I purchased is the niacin amide 10% plus
zinc 1% it says it's a high strength
vitamin and mineral blemish formula I've
been using this as a serum I would say
most of the nights since I bought this
and I'm a little bit less than halfway a
little bit of this goes a long way it's
kind of like a little bit more viscous
than a water but it's pretty thin so it
really spreads easily on the skin this
as it dries is really tacky and I don't
know I haven't really noticed anything
amazing honestly with this I don't know
what it's doing but I'm using it if I'm
being honest with you guys but yeah I
mean I'm gonna finish it up I wouldn't
repurchase that though at the moment
because I don't really see something
that I can attribute to that you know
and the last product I have from the
ordinary this is a
thing I do really like its the high
adherence silicone primer I thought this
was gonna be very similar to like the
Smashbox primer but it's not it's white
and it's not clear and as much as this
definitely feels like silicone there's
something about it that just feels a
little bit more moisturizing and I
really like it this is something if
you're looking for just a smoothing base
I don't find that this controls my oils
or really it doesn't fill in pores for
me but if you want something that's just
going to help your foundation kind of
like smooth over your skin a little bit
easier kind of get rid of a little bit
of texture just kind of overall give
yourself a better prepped skin to put
foundation on I think this is great and
I believe this is like five dollars
which is an amazing price I have really
enjoyed this primer and yeah I'm gonna
finish that one up as well next I have
some items that I did return so I
returned the House of lashes pencil
eyeliners this was a three pencil kit I
got it on clearance it was something
that I had had my eye on for a while
even before it went on clearance and
even in the video I'm really excited for
them whatever I found the more I used
them that they just didn't give me any
definition like the whole point of an
eyeliner for me is that it's going to
define my eyes and in these colors
they're just they're pigmented but they
just wouldn't like do anything for me
there was a light pink which obviously
is not gonna give me any definition I
wasn't expecting too much from that but
the bronze I mean still just didn't give
me enough it didn't give me enough it
was like a wash almost like I feel like
I could have just had a shadow stick
which would have been better they just
did not work out for me the gold one as
well it just didn't show up I tried
using it and the more I was trying to
use them the more I realized like these
are not going to work for me I know that
I'm going to end up decluttering these
down the line so I'd rather get my money
back and try something else I feel like
there's a reason that they were on sale
I have two more items that I returned I
had a Moroccan oil lip balm and this was
something that I was so excited about I
had waited for it to come back into
stock I loved Moroccan oil products so I
was I was down for this and the texture
of this just didn't fit what I liked it
was a little bit too thin I found now
that with lip balms I can tell things
that I know I'm not gonna like off the
bat if they're too thin they just like
feel weird on my lips and I cannot stand
so instead of keeping that item because
it is a $17 lip balm I did return that
one it just is not for me that one was
not for me I loved the scent of it
though it was like I'm a mint tea and I
wanted to keep it so bad but I knew I
couldn't just keep it because it was
Moroccan oil and the last item that I
ended up returning was the bare minerals
well-rested powder this was something I
had purchased to help with the dark
circles I felt like I was having under
my eyes I just wanted something that was
gonna brighten up the area and I just
felt like no matter how little of that
product I used it was just a little too
heavy looking under the eye it also was
a little bit too dark and yellow for me
so just wasn't undetectable which is
what I wanted I wanted something very
natural that was gonna give a
brightening effect without looking like
a ton of makeup and I felt like in every
way that product just did not work for
me I'm still on the hunt for something
perfect but I will say I do like just
like a very light translucent powder
that's what's been working the best
along with having that color corrector
and then a good concealer so yeah I had
to return that one guys a lot of you
guys warned me in the comments that it
might be a little bit too dark for me
and to only use a little bit of product
but it just didn't matter how much how
little I used it wasn't gonna work
moving on from that I showed the NYX
glitter primer in this video and I love
this I've been using it a lot if you've
been watching any of my tutorials I
really feel like this glitter primer as
well as just foiling my shadows has
really changed my eyeshadow game I know
that foiling shadows is not something
new but I just think that I would always
use my finger and I felt like that
should be enough I shouldn't have to do
more than that but honestly with some of
these new formulations as well as just
like if you want to get the most out of
your shadow if you really want that
blinding metallic look if you really
want it to stick to your eyelid all day
long I highly suggest using something
like a glitter glue or a tacky base
where it's going to have something to
stick on to it I know a lot of us you
know put down a primer and then buff
over with like an eyeshadow to make it
not sticky so we can blend on top of it
but if you really want a pop and lid you
need something that's going to make that
eye shadow stick to it so I do suggest
this this is a great price I think elf
has one as well I've heard good things
haven't tried it if you want something
even more affordable than the Too Faced
one which I feel
the standard I am gonna talk about a few
of the many samples that I had because I
have tried some of them so this is the
Marc Jacobs shameless foundation I was
really excited to get this I believe I
had gotten this as a sample before all
of the reviews had come out saying that
it was horrible
basically this foundation has not been
received well like all like no one likes
it and I ended up getting the full-size
in an influenster voxbox so that kind of
worked out this one's too late for me
this one's too dark for me so I mix them
together and honestly I don't feel like
I have an opinion yet I've tried this
multiple times I don't hate it but I
don't love it and I can understand why
people don't like it so I definitely
need to try this out a little bit more
I'm not like comfortable being like it
sucks or it's the best or really
anything if you were super interested in
this I definitely suggest getting a
sample this isn't gonna give you crazy
full coverage but I think that sometimes
it's difficult to look at reviews of
people who are doing things online
because a lot of the influencers out
there are going to be doing a more full
coverage face because they go to events
they're on camera and that makes sense
for their lifestyle but I don't think
that's everyone all the time sometimes
it is and if that's how you like to wear
your makeup then that works perfectly
for you but the point I'm trying to make
here is that I just don't think you
should apply the different foundations
out there with different coverages and
different like ideas of what they're
supposed to be the same way and expect
the same results and I know this isn't
supposed to be necessarily super full
coverage it is supposed to be kind of
like more natural that all being said I
still need to test this but I did want
to talk about it a little bit because it
is such a like polarizing foundation on
the market right now I had a little
sample of the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation I will leave a picture up
here and I did test the sample out and I
did not like it it was very thin very
oily and I was expecting it to be glowy
I knew what it was about but it did not
work for me texture wise I did not like
it I felt like it never set on my skin
even if I put a powder on so did not
like that foundation another little
sample that I know you guys have heard
me talk about so I will keep it short
this is the Lynn edge lip sleeping mask
and I love it so great this is the
strawberry version which I believe is
the only one sold at Sephora but you can
get other versions I know that they're
out there
I saw Stephanie Nicole talk about it oh
yeah if you want to check that out
definitely do this is just great if you
need something at night even in the
daytime this is just an amazing lip balm
it's not too thick but it's not too thin
it doesn't feel greasy it's just it's a
great it's a great formula highly
suggest and now we're gonna get into the
items that are PR so these were all sent
to me but like I said in that video just
because something sent to me doesn't
mean that I'm going to like change how I
feel about it it just means that I
didn't pay for it
the first item here is from Dior and
this is the Dior skin
nude air Luminizer in 0-2 and I've had
this in a favorites video since this
haul because I love it this is one of my
favorite highlighters that I own I just
really like this for my skin tone I tend
to I mean I feel like I'm warmer but I
do have a lot of redness in my skin so
it can make me look a little pink
sometimes especially in my chest and I
don't know this just looks so nice there
is the wet and wild highlighter that is
similar but I do enjoy this one better
tone wise those are very similar but I
feel like this looks less shimmery and
just more glowy I don't know how to
explain it but I love this I'm really
grateful that I was able to get that
because it's one of my favorite products
next I have two primers this first one
is from Oprah again this was sent to me
from octiline and this is the cool as a
cucumber moisturizing primer in one that
hydrates smooths and soothes that
hydrates soothes and smoothes that is so
hard to say I really do like this primer
I feel like this is just kind of
run-of-the-mill it's nothing that I
think that you should like go out and
buy or everyone should go out and buy
but I think it's nice it's like a
moisturizer or like a gel cream
moisturizer so as a base it gives you
hydration and I do think it kind of like
consume your skin I don't think it's
smooth in the way of like getting rid of
texture or filling in pores but it does
give you a nice smooth base to work on
and again just like helps foundation go
on to the skin easier so I've enjoyed it
has like a nice cucumber refreshing
scent so that's nice but um yeah I've
enjoyed it I don't think it's like a
must-have in everyone's collection but
if it's interesting to you I think it's
good similarly to that this is the
Clarins SOS primer again sent to me
through octiline and this is a primer
that has a bit of a glow to it this does
have some shimmer it's nothing that's
like huge so if your
really worried about like glitter this
doesn't have glitter in it but it does
have a shimmer to it when it comes to
texture this feels like an in-between of
like a moisturizer and a more silicone
primer so it has like a weight to it but
it doesn't feel overly silicone II I
think the closest thing I can think of
is the Clinique universal primer I feel
like it feels very similar to that so I
do like this again I think it's really
nice if you're looking for a glow I
don't think it's something everyone
needs but I think it's a good product so
I've been enjoying that the times that
I've used it I think it's really nice
and I do like the way it makes your skin
feel that one has a bit more smoothing
properties in it I feel like than the
Oprah one and last I have some pur Lisse
products that I wanted to mention and
give you guys some like more reviews on
so the first one here is the Blue Lotus
four-in-one cleansing milk this is
something I have in a project use it up
just to force myself to like actually
clean my face it's a big goal I have
this years to actually clean my face
with soap and water instead of only
wipes and I've been using this and I
freaking love it I'm probably about to
hear on it I think this is an amazing
cleanser it's something different than
I've ever used before but you know again
I wasn't using a ton of soap and water
before as it goes this gets my makeup
off I do a double cleanse with it and it
gets all my makeup off like all of it I
don't even use micellar water really any
more I'm not using as many cotton rounds
I'm not using like half of the waste
that I was creating before which is
amazing this is gentle it doesn't leave
my skin feeling stripped but I don't
feel oily either but it gets everything
off it's crazy highly highly suggest
this it's an expensive freakin cleanser
so I understand and again I'm like going
to be on the lookout for other products
that are similar to this that are at a
lower price point once I finish this up
but I do really like this again if
you're interested in it this is
something that I do suggest I really do
enjoy it and similarly to that I have
the pur Lisse BB cream here this is in
the shade light and they have five
different shades they have a fair light
medium dark and then deep I think this
is a
I've used about half of so I've used
quite a bit of this as well I like this
on its own and I also like this with
other products like using it as a mixer
to kind of give something more hydration
kind of shear it out if it has a lot of
coverage and I'm looking for something a
little bit lighter this gives you a very
radiant finish on the skin not because
it has any like shimmer to it but just
because it leaves that like do we look
like that's the finish of this I don't
find that I get overly dewy with this
with my oily skin throughout the day
this is another product that has ended
up in a favorites video since showing it
in that hall and I do really really like
this again it's very very expensive but
it's great I feel like this is very
comparable to something like the it
cosmetics CC cream so if that's
something you like and you want to try
this out I would check it out I find
that the shade runs a little bit kind of
neutral grey I guess you could say it's
not like overly warm but it's also not
like super pink toned so I do really
enjoy this and I've liked it in the last
product from pur Lisse as well as the
last product I'm going to be talking
about in this video is the lip balm in
the initial haul video I had said that
it wasn't my favorite and I have since
ended up decluttering that item I don't
I didn't like it it's one of those ones
that just was too thin too greasy I
didn't like the way it felt on my lips
like immediately I can tell now what I
like and I just I knew I think no this
is not what I want and it's kind of sad
because it's like a mango one I really
wanted to like it but it didn't even
like taste or smell like mango so that
wasn't even an intriguing aspect to it
so for me the lip balm is a no-go I
didn't like that alright guys so that is
my haul in retrospect I hope you guys
enjoyed just hearing my kind of like
more in depth thoughts on these products
as I've tested them a little bit more I
would say that overall with this haul I
definitely feel like I'm learning myself
a little bit more things I like things I
don't and sometimes you can't kind of
know a little bit about like what you
might like from a first use and just
continue using it and things that just
like aren't going to work at all for you
so more than anything I am really happy
that I returned the items that didn't
work out for me if I spent my money and
it's not gonna work out I try to be a
conscious consumer before I even go in
and purchase stuff and a lot of the time
I do not return things but I'm really
happy that I did
returning the things that I did because
it afforded me to get other products
that I know I'm actually gonna love and
use of my collection and since I do buy
quite a bit of makeup I don't think I'm
like abusing a system in any way so
anyway that's everything for this video
thank you so so much for watching guys
and I will see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
