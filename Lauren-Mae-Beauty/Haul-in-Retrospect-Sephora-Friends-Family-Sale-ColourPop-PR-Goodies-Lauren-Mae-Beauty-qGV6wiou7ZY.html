Lauren thank you so much for watching
Wow every time I've always cracks it's
like my intro today we're gonna be doing
another haul in retrospect I know I just
recently did one but this is a haul of
stuff that I bought during the
friends-and-family sale from Sephora and
then it's kind of a bunch of other stuff
that I kind of tacked on I have some
colour-pop I had some PR items so I'm
going to go over those items with you
and tell you what I think about them now
that I've had quite a bit of time to
play with them just so you guys know I
do have a get ready with me doing this
look at least the eye look I did change
out the lip because I had to stop
filming to let the lone blowers go and
then I'm also going to add another video
of what I'm doing today so I'm gonna
have a lot of videos in this look so
just prepare yeah
sorry not sorry the video that I'm
adding is going to be a let stupid on
the new Kylie cosmetics I think it's
called blue honey or something like that
that palette it looks really pretty the
swatches and like reveal of it just came
out today I already had people asking me
to do it so I thought I would do it film
it today I don't know if it'll be up but
if it is already up I'm gonna have it
linked down below and if not look for it
it's coming so looking back at that old
video which will be linked down below if
you want to check it out I'm gonna go in
actual order from the first thing I
talked about all the way till the end
since I wrote it down I can actually do
that the first things that I talked
about I got at Sephora during the
friends-and-family sale so I first
picked up this creator set from nude
Stix this is the creators palette and
it's limited edition and each one of
these shades was made in collaboration
with an influencer so let me try to show
you the colors so lots of fun colors I
am wearing when today this is the shade
freckle and it's suing of the Ravan
dolls color so I've actually really been
enjoying this I think I've tried all of
them but maybe one since then I don't
think I've tried go girl I have tried
sonoran which doesn't look the best on
me it looks okay it's very grungy I've
worn this one quite a bit the darker
shade which is Joyce Montaigne is really
pretty it's like a cool tone grungy news
Oh - baby Kay is really pretty it's kind
of like a more I feel like it's like a
brighter dulled Coral on me I know that
sounds so contradictory but that's what
I think anyway I do really like these
the formula on these are like a liquid
lipstick in a pencil form I know that
sounds crazy but it's so true when you
put these on they're creamy but then
they dry down and they feel like a
liquid lipstick like what lipsticks in
general aren't something that I wear on
a day-to-day basis I'm a much more
chilled out girl for me on the everyday
if I went with something from their line
it wouldn't be these would be like the
lip and cheek pencils but if you're
looking for a liquid lipstick or you
enjoy liquid lipsticks these are really
cool I love the formula of them I love
nude sticks as a brand as well so I'm
really happy with this I saw lip
swatches from ls which I will leave link
down below I did in that video too
that's the entire reason I bought this
because she made a whole cool lip swatch
video and it was really great so
everything about this I really like
I like supporting the creators and all
of that so this is awesome and then the
other item that I got from Sephora is
this Joe Malone fragrance this is the
English oak and red currant I believe
this is limited edition for fall this
smells really nice it's definitely I
think a unisex scent and it almost is
spicy like the longer I have it the more
it smells spicy to me I do really like
this although I mean you can tell I've
used quite a bit of it I don't like it
as much as blackberry in bag that's my
absolute favorite scent I also really
like the nectarine one nectarine and
nectarine blossom and honey something
like that I really like that scent
- and I think they pair really nice
together so if I had to if I could go
back in time I probably would buy the
blackberry in baby but that doesn't mean
I don't like this does that make sense I
just know I like that one more and since
I don't have it in my collection I'd
rather have that one before having this
one but this one's still really nice
it's not a complete regret it's more
just like I think I would have liked
that one better long-term but this
smells nice I do like it it smells I
think Jo Malone fragrances are just very
unique and I enjoy them a lot so I would
love to have multiples I'm not sure if I
said that was the last thing from
Sephora but it wasn't this is from Urban
Decay
it's the heavy metal liner in the shade
pyro this is one of the new ones so
they've had the heavy metal liners for a
long time and then they most recently
came out with like five new shades and I
picked up pyro because it's just kind of
an easy one it's a blue purple green
violet glitter it's really really pretty
I really love this I've used it quite a
few times since I got it and it makes
putting on glitter really easy I wore
this on New Year's Eve just on my inner
corner that's the way I like to wear it
the most I would definitely suggest this
and I probably will pick up more of
these when I have just some extra money
and want to get something fun I love
these because it's such an easy way to
do glitter and I highly suggest it if
they haven't checked him out and the
actual last thing from Sephora is
something I don't have anymore it's the
Laura Mercier little eye primer in wheat
this was just a deluxe sized sample that
I picked up and I just don't like it it
was in my most recent disappointing
products video which I'll leave a link
down below if you want to check it out
but yeah no I didn't really like the way
it felt on the eye it felt like it was
leaving like a film it was a little too
dark for my skin tone so I just think
there are so many primers out on the
market that I will not go back to that
and I will not try it again I won't try
it in a lighter shade I would rather
just pay two dollars for an elf one or
try a different high-end one next I
shared my Crabtree and Evelyn hand cream
set that I got at Costco Sam bought me
this for an anniversary because it was
our ten-year anniversary oh it's so cute
it's crazy how fast a year's going I
can't believe it's almost gonna be my
birthday and I don't know it's crazy oh
so so I've taken them out of that tin so
far and I thought I would just show you
I mean it came with so many hand creams
for $35 it was crazy
I have pomegranate I have Summerhill
avocado which I'm really excited to try
this one is called gardeners this is
Somerset meadow lessors and that one
sounds different verbena and lavender
that one sounds amazing
Nantucket briar and a pair and pink
magnolias and then one I'm working on
currently is the citron one and I've
used up the lavender so I've already
used up a whole one of these I really do
like the formula
I like these small versions of these
hand creams because I can kind of just
try out different
to move on to the next one I just like
that and I just have a weird like
fascination with hand creams and really
love them it's the weirdest thing
especially because I don't really enjoy
lotions but I tend to put hand cream on
only at night so when I go to bed I'll
put quite a bit on go to sleep and I
wake up and my hands are nice and soft
and I can do whatever I need to in the
day and then kind of repair them at
night so I do highly suggest this hand
cream formula I think it's amazing it's
super silky on the hands it actually
feels like it's penetrating the skin and
hydrating the skin and I think they have
a lot of unique scent options so I would
definitely check them out if you like
hand creams like I like crazy alright
next is my color pop stuff so the first
thing I did pick up the color pop My
Little Pony palette and I have a whole
get ready with me using like these blue
shades if you want to check it out I'll
leave it linked I do like this palette I
think it's nice it's kind of a weird
combination of shadows but I also like
it at the same time I think some of
these are beautiful I love this like
duochrome shade I think that some of the
mattes in here are nice did I mean this
palette definitely not is the quality
good yes so I mean it's just not a
must-have in my collection but I do
enjoy it because I have it honestly if I
could go back in time when I purchase
this I don't know I don't know if I
would
but yeah those are my thoughts it's a
good quality it was something you really
like you probably will like it but it's
definitely not a must-have for me next
from the My Little Pony collection I did
pick up a lip gloss this is the shade
Pony land and it's beautiful it's like a
glittery purple I do like this I think
it's very interesting you can feel the
glitter on your lips and it does leave
the glitter on your lips throughout the
day so I kinda don't mind that because
if I'm gonna have glitter on my lips
like I wanted to stay there it's
definitely a little gritty so keep that
in mind I don't really mind it because
if I'm going for something like this
it's kind of specific yeah I like this I
think this was a nice purchase I thought
it was a good price I hate the packaging
though on color pops like the writing
just rubs off so easy I have barely had
this like in my purse or anything it
hasn't been moving around a ton and it's
already scratching off so I just wish
the packaging wasn't so cheap but it is
a cheap product I guess I'm being a
little expectant on that
no I don't know every was because I just
got a message saying another person
stealing all my videos yeah anyway um I
think we were on the colour-pop
eyeshadows that I hauled I think so in
that hall I had picked up a few more of
the single shadows because you guys know
I cannot stay away no matter how much I
try to so they had released pretty
recently too when I made this order a
bunch of new single shadows and they
decided to bundle them so you could buy
them at a bundled price so I picked up
the what they call it yin to my yang
collection this has six different
eyeshadows in it so this one is it now
and Zen this one is snake bite I have
tea garden glass bowl which is like
people's favorite this is the shape
let's do it it's a matte black and then
I have the shade dragonfly man I am good
I didn't even look at the backs of those
anyway I really like this collection
this is definitely a little bit
different for me because it is more cool
toned it has two of the well three of
the duo crumbs it has three duo crumbs
to it which i think are so fun I am
wearing the shade snakebite and dragon
fly on my eyes today those are like the
two main shadows I'm wearing besides the
pink so if you want to check out the get
ready with me you can see them in action
I still really like these I think this
was a great bundle I really love color
pop single shadows you guys know that
only a few more things left the rest of
the stuff was sent to me through octoly
so yeah let's get into it
I have the bronze goddess bronzer from
Estee Lauder in the shade light this has
since been in a favorites video so I do
really like this I think I had mentioned
that it was like a little red or like
something was weird about it and I did
have a few reservations when I first
started using it but I find that this
just looks really pretty on the skin I
really enjoy the way this bronzer looks
I was reaching for this bronzer over the
other bronzers that I had in my
collection so it definitely is a
favorite what this is expensive though
so I don't know if I'd purchase it but I
think that it's a good product if you
are looking into it it's really good but
I there are a lot of bronzers that I
like in a lower price range next I had
some nail polishes now I have given one
away if you've seen my nail polish
declutter I will leave that link down
below I've gotten rid of so many nail
polishes I think I got rid of a third of
my collection in that video which I look
at my
I'll polish drawer now and it's so
exciting and just so nice and clean I've
painted my nails for the first time in
like a long-ass time so that's exciting
but the one color that I did keep out of
that duo this is from OPI and it is the
shade Suzi without a paddle I mentioned
in that video but the other shade that
was in this duo was a yellow and it was
supposed to be like this fall thing and
the picture that they showed online was
this and like a dark teal not a yellow
it was just all types of messed up
anyway I have not used this yet I am
working on it I'm working on it guys so
I will be trying this out I'm really
excited though to try the infinite shine
collection for OPI to see how long they
last on the nails so I think I might
make this the next color that I put on
my nails
it'll look cute with my background too
and the last product was this one from
Clarence this is the everlasting compact
powder foundation I thought this is
going to be a cream foundation so I was
really excited but it's not it's like a
powder it is really nice I feel like
I've used this quite a bit if you've
seen a lot of my get ready with me then
you've seen me use it but it doesn't
look like I've used any of it it's a
very soft silky powder it does not kick
up a lot of powder when you put your
brush in it which is nice if you want it
to last a while I don't think it's
anything revolutionary but it's not bad
so I will use this up and enjoy it it
also has a unique scent to it which I
know is weird but it's a very fruity
scent so yeah that's just like an
interesting little quirk with this
perfect I much prefer that though to
some type of like floral face powder
that's gross
so those are my thoughts on those
products I hope you guys enjoyed this
haul in retrospect I have I think I'm
pretty caught up now I do need to like
do my Black Friday haul type of thing
but other than that
that's the only one out there so I feel
great to be caught up I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if you've
tried any of these things down below and
what your thoughts on them are and I
will see you in the next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
