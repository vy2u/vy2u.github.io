back to my channel this is going to be a
kind of a different video I am thinking
about panning a pallet next year I kind
of joined YouTube a little late into the
year and like the end of februari and so
I didn't jump on panning a pallet then
so I thought that for next year I'd get
like a head start and I kind of wanted
to consult you guys on some of the
pallets I was thinking about doing and I
just wanted to hear your opinions in the
comments really so i'm going to show you
the pallets I've been thinking that I'm
going to potentially pan I'm gonna do
one eyeshadow palette for sure and then
I was kind of thinking about pairing it
with a blush palette I don't know how
I'm gonna do that I know curious
sparkles did that and it just sets a
tough one it's so tough so I don't know
I thought I'd show you guys my pics and
then I'd love to hear down below what
you guys think of them I'm also gonna
let you know like why I'm choosing them
or why they're potentially in the
running for becoming a palette I want to
pan just hearing maybe your opinions on
it might help me make a more informed
decision I don't know I might not even
listen to any of you guys and just go
with whatever I want so we'll see we'll
see what happens I just kind of thought
it'd be a good discussion and kind of
help me finalize my decision anyway
let's get into the pallets that I'm
considering there are quite a few in no
particular order the first one I'm
thinking about panning is the Miami
appellate from anastacio this palette is
beautiful i have used it it's not
because i haven't used it much i just
thought that these pans aren't that big
and so with something that I could
definitely accomplished while still
using other shadows in my collection
throughout the year they all are mostly
very wearable except for this blue which
would be kind of a struggle but I feel
like we could like make it through that
one yeah I just thought this had a good
mix of a lot of neutrals that would make
it easy to go through so that was my
first one and the fact that they're
small pans I thought it might be nice to
use other palettes with it or just not
get too bored using a ton of product
from another palette I don't know if
that makes sense in that same vein I
also chose the Anasazi Beverly Hills
lavish palette this is an older palette
so that's part of the reason why I chose
just because the eyeshadows are older i
think this came out in 2013 i have
already hit pan on one of the shades
which i did in a project pan so these
eyeshadows again are smaller and a lot
of them are super neutral I don't know
I'm leaning toward this one just because
i already have progress on it and again
it's older so it'd be nice i really
wanted this palette to actually get my
use of it I thought they were done
anyway I thought that I would get my use
of this one but I don't know I don't
know let me know I kind of I'm leaning
toward this one so this is like in the
top so i think that one would be nice to
just like get out on a collection but no
I used it this one is a palette from
Smashbox this is the blue eyes palette
this only has six shadows in it and
they're kind of like the size of a mac
or a makeup geek eyeshadow these are
again really neutral so I thought they
would be easy to get through without
like hating my life this is a pallet
agonda CCO with me and Sam came out to
California one time before we lived here
I don't get a ton of use out of this I
have used it before but I don't use it
nearly as much as I should so I thought
it'd be a good way to again get my
money's worth and it is older not that
I've had in a long time but since I got
a sec oh it's like discontinued type of
thing so this is also one of the ones
i'm really considering even though it's
like a full size eye shadow it's only
six of them instead of like 12 of them
plus you can pair a lot of these with
other things this is what i'm thinking
about obviously they're all ones i'm
thinking about the NARS narcissus is
another one I've been thinking about
there are a lot of shades in here but
they are smaller pants I just don't use
this one nearly enough and I feel like
this was such an expensive palette and I
just hate that I haven't used it like at
all and I thought if I Pandit then I'd
feel better about the money I spent on
it so that's the reason I'm kind of
considering this palette I thought it
had a lot of variety in it and again
since the pans are kind of smaller I
don't know how deep they are but it says
there I think they're all one gram each
eye shadow so i don't know i don't know
how i feel again let me know what you
think three more pallets this is the one
I was probably
considering the most until I went back
through these and I'm showing you them
now this is the Stila soul palette and I
wear this on my wedding I do have a
couple like dips going in a couple of
the shades and I don't know I mean this
isn't an old pallet I just I like this
palette I think it's really nice it is a
neutral palette has a good mix of mats
and shimmers and I just thought I guess
I was looking at it and thinking I could
use that for a whole year and not hate
myself at least that's what I say now so
this one was the 1i was probably
considering the most but I think because
I liked it so much I think it'd be more
challenging to do something maybe that
has a couple colors in it that will be
hard i think maybe I'll feel more
fulfilled but then again this has a lot
of product in it these are large shadows
these are I think each one is point 5 1
ounces there's no way than that other
ones are one else or no one gram hmm mm
i don't know i'm not sure but these ones
look a lot bigger and there's a lot of
them so i don't know again in the top
like three so far the laura mercier
artist palette is also another one I've
been considering i've had this palette
since it came out originally i didn't
read like i didn't buy it when it got
reprimanded be a nice way to make sure
i'm using it more often I love fresco
and African violet and it's kind of a
more plummy tone so it's a little bit
different than just straight-up neutrals
anyway I thought again this one would be
a nice one to pan but these are a lot of
shadows too and this one isn't like as
old I feel like I do use this one more
than like the Anasazi one so I just
thought I'd put that in here again it's
an expensive palette as well and last
for eyeshadow palettes this is the kat
von d st. palette and i have considered
throwing not throwing it away but
passing this on but there's something
about these shadows that are so pretty
they swatch them well and this one I
just thought if I pandit this year it
would force me to use it and get my
money's worth and not completely let it
just sit in my drawer and waste away so
again this is enough
what I'm really considering i don't know
i just i think it'd be nice they are all
shimmery really except for like maybe
two but they have some glitter running
through them so um this and i want to
use because of how old it is in the fact
that i don't use it i feel like i don't
want to get rid of it but i haven't used
it and this would be a way to force me
to use it up so that's why i have thrown
this one in as considering i have no
kind of as a recap these are the 4 i'm
like considering even more now that I
went through them so the kat von d 1 the
Anasazi lavish palette this one from
Smashbox the blue eyes and then also the
NARS narcissus just because of how
expensive it is those are my top four
I'm kind of considering out of all these
of course these aren't all the pallets
they don't have so many more than this
but let me know what you guys think or
if there's something you know I have
that you can go to be better or whatever
and let me know down below and I just
would love to know your thoughts whether
you pan to palette whether you haven't
it's just sometimes nice to like talk
out and hash out little details because
it's a whole year long project and i
really like planning and being
successful and that type of stuff and i
feel like if i go in with a game plan I
think it will be more successful and
less torture torturous as I go through
it so anyway those are the 4 i'm really
considering as well as the other ones
that i have potentially consider it as
well and then again I haven't decided if
i want to do a blush palette but there
are three that i am considering i love
blush palettes I think they're so great
and I have three in here and they're all
kind of being considered for different
reasons so first I have the tarina
tarantino this is the blush palette I
believe it's the dull skin cheek palette
I'm doing this just because of how old
it is this is one of the first things i
ever bought i think it was on sale on
supporters website when i bought it and
when i first got into makeup it was one
of my first like big big purchases
beautiful shades I just don't want to
get rid of it but it's older I mean
powders don't go bad bad but I don't
really want these to get to that state
so it's just something i'm considering i
might even just like want to hit pan on
everything and not use the whole blush
up but just hit pan so this is mine just
because of how old it is and I don't
want to like get rid
so I thought I might as well try to hit
pan on them this is a smaller palette
this is the eve pearl blush trio in
Sweet Cheeks light I thought this would
be a good one because very neutral
they're smaller so it's not as much
product so it wouldn't be as just
overwhelming it wouldn't be so
overwhelming choosing this palette and I
thought to it go with everything and it
wouldn't take all year to necessarily
pan it so I could have freedom to use
other things throughout the year not
just feel totally trapped and like off
track if I didn't use this for a week or
something like if I was choosing a ton
of blushes anyway that's just something
i'm considering this one I'm choosing or
like considering because it's so small
and it would be easier to pan because
there just isn't as much product and the
colors are very wearable and the last
one I'm considering is the tart
off-the-cuff palette this was holiday i
believe 2013 i love this palette i
wanted to get the one the year after it
and the one this year but I stopped
myself because I just haven't used this
one enough to justify getting those as
much as I love it so I thought again
panning it would be a way for me to get
my money's worth out of it really use it
and enjoy this palette on this one I
would probably only want to hit pan on
everything again I'm not trying to just
neglect other things in my collection
because when you are focusing so heavily
on something you ultimately have to
leave other things to the side and not
use them so you can really see progress
on the item's your choosing and I don't
want it to just be that all year long
but I also I want to see some use out of
my products and want to see myself
hitting pan on some things so yeah I'd
love to hit pan and the bronzer would be
an easy one to you know use as my normal
bronzer every day that's it those are
some of the considerations I'm having
for next year's pan that palette I think
amber F is doing this deal in the light
palette and I don't know if everyone's
going to like go off and do that one I
know I've heard of other people but not
everyone seems to be doing like a
collective palette this next year let me
know if you know if it's like a
collective thing I kind of want to
choose something that is personal to my
collection in the sense that it's going
to be the best choice for my collection
to get out of the best choice for me to
get out of my collection
anyway that's everything please let me
know what you guys think what any of
that like what you guys think about it
if you pan a pallet what were your
experiences what do you think would be
easy or like what one would you not
consider because it looks way too hard
or for whatever reasons it be a bad one
that's everything thanks so much for
your help i appreciate it i am thanking
you in advance if i can't bribe actu all
of your comments know that i took them
in and then at the beginning of the year
i will let you guys know which pellet i
will be starting off with so thank you
so much for all of your help and your
support i will see you in my next video
