Lauren today I thought I would do the
highlighter challenge mario's you
started this whole thing with her
picture on Instagram I will also leave
her video linked down below if you want
to check that out and then since then so
many other people have done it and I
just wanted to join it I thought it'd be
fun to basically do an entire face full
of shimmery products know Matt's here
and just see how hard i can get my glow
on so let's get into how we're gonna do
this hopefully I can cover up some of
these pores first thing i did scrub my
face so that i could eliminate as much
texture as possible but i am still going
to go in with a primer that is for pore
minimizing this girl has pores and if
i'm going to put highlighter all over my
face lordy lord it's gonna be scary so i
would like to make it look as nice as
humanly possible i'm just going to put
those into my problem areas for our
first glowy item i'm going to go in with
the pure and i believe it's used to be
pure minerals but now they're just going
by pure correcting primer and this is
the illuminate and glow I've never used
this but it is quite below e that's what
it looks like so I'm going to put that
all over my face just to prime the rest
of my face as you can tell i prepared
for this video with my glitter roots i
thought i'm going to glow let's glow all
the way no because i'm trying to use as
many products as possible i'm going to
go in with some cream highlighters and
i'm going to kind of cream contour my
face that highlighter style so this is
the darkest cream highlighter have this
is benefits what's up i'm gonna put that
in the places that you would be a little
bit darker see I'm so fair look at that
and then I'm just actually going to
blend that in with my fingers that's the
best way this product blends
now I'm going to go into the tops of my
cheekbones with the Marc Jacobs
spotlight glow stick I just got this
from Influenster and I thought this
would be the perfect time to use it
that's what it looks like I'm going to
put this on just the tops of my
cheekbones and I think like under the
contour we just did the contour anymore
says he's like a brush to apply this but
I'm just going for it since I want to
intense highlight i am gonna use a brush
to blend that out this is just like a
synthetic kind of don't brush and then
last i'm going to go in with my high
beam and i'm gonna go under my eyes
almost like a concealer i am still gonna
go in and add foundation because i am so
fair there's a lot of hyperpigmentation
and tonal variation in my face so just
highlighters are going to be able to
really help me there so I'm gonna just
use this all underneath my eyes and then
i'm also going to put it kind of like
here down my nose and then also on my
chin and all the cute with full let's
not forget them and then i'm going to
blend that in with my Beauty Blender
now that we're super glowy under our
makeup we're gonna go in and like i said
i am going to use foundation this one is
from make up forever it's the ultra HD
and i'm going to use just i think a pump
maybe two this is a very skin-like
finish so that's why i'm using this one
instead of something else in my
collection and I'm really just trying to
even out some spots and different things
I have with this I'm not trying to get
like super full coverage I just want to
see redness through the highlighters so
I had to change out my battery and I
didn't film any of what I've done so far
how horrible is that so hopefully I can
feel you in my life fast right now I'm
really sorry but I'm not gonna refill in
this video like I have glitter in my
hair like it's a one-time thing so I
went in and put a little bit of my
makeup forever Ultra HD foundation onto
my skin i use two pumps of this and I
blended it in with my Beauty Blender
then my dark circles and just a few
spots need a little bit of help so I
went in with my maybelline fit me and
just used as little of it as I possibly
could I just needed some coverage
underneath my dark circles or they were
just gonna look like zombie glowing dark
circles then back onto highlighters I
went in with my Laura Geller baked
highlighter in french vanilla and I use
this essentially almost like a powder
foundation and I buff this into my skin
I used this like more dense ish fluffy
amazing this more dense a foundation
brush and just buffed it into my skin
this is more of a natural glow instead
of just like a metallic low I thought
this would be a good all over face
highlight and then I could go in and
really amp up some things then I'm
telling you I was like so mad when I saw
that it wasn't filming then I went in
with this as a kind of starting bronzer
shade so I put this in the areas you
normally would kind of brown / contour
so I did like the hollows of my cheeks
the temple area and then under my
jawline and now currently what I what I
am doing is going in with the Anasazi
Beverly Hills glow kid in that glow and
I'm using the color here which is golden
bronze and I'm really using this to
deepen up with those contour and bronzy
shades just to give my skin a little bit
of dimension it's a little scary over
here
that way I'm not just like one color
that's a rat I'm super sorry
I'm going to go in with this brush and
do a little bit of a nose contour just
because I normally would do every day
and I'm just gonna do with the shimmery
shade and see how that goes I'm using
that same color from honest
now that that's done I'm going to go in
and do a little bit of blush where my
blush I'm gonna try using this rose gold
highlighter from Becca and see how that
works
that wasn't enough color so I'm going to
go in with this super shimmery blush
from Sephora this was like a limited
edition salad and add more color you
know if you have perfect skin this is
great but if you have texture my gosh
and let's highlight a little bit right
so I'm going to use this Bobby Brown
highlighter this is in pink glow and I'm
going to be using the most white part
and I'm going to be putting that right
actually underneath my eyes and see how
that looks so she can take that on to
the cheekbone as well oh my gosh I have
to turn down my setting so you guys can
hopefully see it a little bit
and I'm going to actually kind of like
to go under my contour
it's a major glow let's just start on
eyebrows for a second I am gonna have to
use like a normal pencil because I don't
really have that much eyebrow hair going
on at all I need to at least kind of
pencil in a little bit and then I'll go
in and fill in with like powder
highlighter
I'm going to brush through my eyebrows
and kind of break any place that's a
little harsh which I like harsh eyebrows
so now I'm going to go in with that same
bronze color from honest hacia and just
fill in and make them more like bronzium
glittery
now to prime my eyes I'm going to be
using another shimmery product this is
the Too Faced shadow insurance and
candle lights at the golden ish color
I'm going to use that to just make sure
my shadows dump crease I used way too
much of that oh lordy Lordy and I went
to put that all the way up to my brow
now I Minister your way a little bit
from just straight-up highlighters and
I'm gonna go in with a duo chrome shadow
this is from makeup geek and it is the
color black light I'm gonna put this all
over my lid I just wanted to bring in
something other than just like bronzes
and I thought this is still super like
Chloe and fit with it so I'm gonna put
this all over my lid I'm just going to
use my finger at this point why not
right and now to give my crease just a
little bit of definition I'm going back
in with that honest hacia dark bronzer
shade we used and just gonna buff that
into the crease and that's gonna be the
eyeshadows i use i didn't really feel
like I needed to go too crazy with it
and now to highlight my brow bone and
also my inner corner I'm going to be
using a pigment actually this is from
gorgeous cosmetics and this is in Sandy
shimmer oh it's a little more yellow
than I thought it was going to be I'm
actually just going to go back into that
bobbi brown highlighter and use that
whitish shade again and use that
underneath the brow bone and on the
inner corner
and just to make sure that purple is
still really nice and bright I'm going
with my finger and just like touch it up
I'm also going to take that honest hacia
bronzer shade pi lighter shade and go
under my lash line and just give more
definition to that area
I'm going to go tight line my upper lash
line I'm also going to put a little bit
of nude in my waterline put lashes on
and mascara and I'll be right back okay
so I just thought my lashes on and did
all the things I said I was gonna do I
did put my lashes on the under way which
I have mentioned in one of my older
videos and I will be showing how to do
that in one of my makeup artist series
videos that I'm going to be filming soon
so be on the lookout for that that is
like my favorite way to apply lashes and
I'm like in love with all lashes I got
for me way so I'm really happy about it
anyway let's go in i'm gonna line my
lips this is just a lip liner from by
Terry it's in the shape number two rows
contour but you can use any color you
want you like have to have lashes in
this or it's you're gonna get lost
and then on top of my lips I'm actually
going to take one of the new makeup geek
duochrome foiled shadows this is
wildfire and I'm going to put that on my
lips
because I can't get enough I'm gonna go
in with more highlighters I just can't
I'm gonna take Becca's moonstone and I'm
going to just really hack that on like
packet
in the last thing here I'm going to
spring myself down with mac fix+ really
