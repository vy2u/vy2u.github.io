florin I'm going to be doing my
highlighter collection today and also my
bronzer but it'll be a separate video
this year I thought that I would share
my collection with you guys collection
videos are obviously super popular here
we all love looking at what other people
have in their collections what they
enjoy what they don't and just sing
singing a ton of makeup this is not
meant to brag obviously and this is also
a way for me personally this year to
really fall back in love with my
collection and to really love the things
i already own instead of just wanting to
buy new things so without further ado
let's get into my highlighters and i
hope you guys enjoy i'm gonna start off
with two Biggie's first so these are the
Anasazi aglow kits and this one is in
the color gleam this is the one I use
the most for myself my husband was doing
a conference at his hotel and Anastasia
Beverly Hills was doing a convention
there so he got this for he got both of
them for free for me but i also got
assigned by anastacio so i was really
cool but i really really love these
highlights they're absolutely beautiful
I think that's something different about
them is you can really build them up if
you want something a little less insane
and not so metallic you can just do like
one swipe with a really you know light
duo fiber brush but you can also build
this up and get something more metallic
so I don't think everyone needs four
shades of highlight some of them are
definitely dark so they're not for
everyone I think if you do makeup on
other people or if you're a huge
collector you might really like them but
I do think that the quality of these are
super nice and the other kit is in that
glow and this one is the more golden
toned of the two this one definitely is
great for like medium to darker skin
tones I usually myself find that I like
more of a neutral or a pinky toned
highlighter that's just me another kind
of mini palette that I made myself are
two highlighters and these are both from
vincent longo one is more of a pink at
the top here and this one is more like a
bronze I hope you guys can see well I
just turned it down a little bit this
pink one is in the color flora these are
really nice I really do like them they
do have a little bit more of like an
actual powder base to them so they're
not just straight-up shimmer they have a
little bit of opacity to them but they
are super pretty I don't think I've
them would really work for to Depot skin
tones though I definitely think these
would be best for like fair to medium
I'm just grabbing them randomly so the
next one I have here is from Laura
Mercier and this is in the color
indiscretion this was limited edition
when I bought it I don't know if it
still is but they do have it out now
when I saw this picture ons foresight I
just couldn't resist it's such a
beautiful embossing on it like I
couldn't I couldn't resist this is more
of a golden highlighter and it is a
little deep for me honestly I still wear
it but I wish I had got the ones that
are out now which they expanded the
shade range for more of that like
lighter pinky tone but it's absolutely
beautiful it is a little more glittering
it's slightly glittery too so not like
too much where I still like it but it
does have a little bit of glitter such a
pretty one this is one of my absolute
favorite highlights this is the baked
highlighter in french vanilla from laura
geller i have definitely made a dent in
this this is like a small size of it but
I mean I have learned more and more that
with highlighters and just products you
don't normally go through very fast
having a small size is really nice
because you probably aren't going to go
through and then you can have a bigger
variety in your collection without
taking up a ton of space or spending as
much money I hope you guys can see it
there it's at the bottom it's such a
beautiful color and this one is more of
a fake one so it kind of gives you just
a sheen it's just more natural and glowy
and you could kind of almost put this in
like more places because it's just not
like so metallic I love it it's so
beautiful I have quite a few of the
Becca highlighters and aside like a
coughing fit mmm this is I believe the
first one I ever got which is funny
because it's like the most unwearable
this is rose gold and it was limited
edition I believe I don't know if
they've come out with it now and now
it's permanent or not but at the time
about it it was limited edition that is
what it looks like this is kind of what
people consider a blush topper because
it is a little bit of a darker highlight
that makes it harder definitely to use
as you can tell from the pattern i
haven't used it a ton it's absolutely
beautiful and i probably won't get rid
of it ever just because one it was
expensive too it is beautiful like you
want to find a way to wear it i think
this would look great on like fnl
darker skin tones they could definitely
pull this off so much more than someone
who's really fair but that's my first
one rose gold next I have champagne pop
now this one was the collaboration with
jaclyn hill we all know and we all
bought it this is definitely way more
wearable I feel like again for a lot
more skin tones even though it's kind of
a peachy golden color I think this is a
really pretty product this is one that I
bought I think because of the hype I
don't think personally I don't think
it's a must-have and it's not like my
everyday type of highlight shade but I
do really like it I am glad I have it
but I mean it's beautiful don't get me
wrong but again I usually go for like
the more pinky or neutral tones like
more I see highlights for myself last in
the full-size I have moonstone now this
one had a little bit of an accident it
did fall these are pretty soft powders
this is definitely really great for
super fair I definitely like this more
than champagne pop just cuz it is
lighter and just feel like it highlights
my skin better than the champagne pop
ones I don't know I know everyone loves
these and I think that they're beautiful
do not get me wrong they are they're
super creamy super pigmented and I know
that the kind of like were one of the
first highlighters supposedly I mean
thing other brands had highlighters out
it just it just kind of fell in line
with the trends I don't know what is in
my throat but they aren't my most
reached for highlighters no matter no
matter how much people talk about them I
don't know why um I think they're still
super beautiful do not get me wrong but
they just aren't my last Becca one is
actually in a small size this is opal
and I'm glad that I have opal and a
small size because this doesn't work for
really fair people it just doesn't I
want it to because it's my favorite one
out of them I think it's such a
beautiful tone but it's too dark for my
skin so this is what I like to have to
use on other people or if I'm like maybe
if I'm really tan and summer I haven't
had it long enough to try it out in the
summer um it might work for me but I'm
just glad to have it just because it is
the most popular it's something I can
easily throw in my kit and it's you know
little I've realized that most of my
highlighters are actually
high-end um I like drug store but i also
like high-end stuff i think that i just
want a lot of people say this and it is
pretty true there aren't a ton of
drugstore highlighters that are actually
really good and personally I think drug
store is still expensive for the most
part some brands are pretty cheap but a
lot of brands are just to me I would
rather spend twenty dollars save it up
and spend twenty dollars then you know
be at the drugstore and basically get
two things for twenty dollars so anyway
this is a highlight from bareMinerals
this is and the color the love affair I
don't hear anyone ever talk about this
highlight and I absolutely love it I
have this in a project pan so I have hit
pan on it which I'm really proud of
because hit pan on the highlighter is
pretty intense this one to me is more
like the Laura Geller one the baked tip
one it gives you just this really pretty
radiance without being super metallics
is not going to look like you're
sweating on your cheek bones in like the
wrong light I really like this it's PG
but because it's not so highly metallic
I feel like it just works really well on
the skin I never hear anyone talk about
it and I do think it's really good so
few or someone who maybe has texture or
finds that really metallic highlighters
just kind of like accentuate fine lines
or anything like that I would try
something that's a little softer like
this or the Laura Geller one they're
really beautiful and you know there's
something to be said about a subtle
highlight it doesn't always have to be
like BAM in your face all the time I'm
not hating I'm just saying that there
are other ways to do your makeup than
just like ones you see all the time next
I have a classic this is the bombs
mary-lou manizer this was one of my
first highlights I ever bought um I do
really like this i don't think i've used
it nearly as much as I should again it
is more of like that lighter golden tone
which is beautiful and it's a really
great highlight I just don't gravitate
to this this year or 2 i've also used a
lot of eyeshadows as highlighters just
because i'm trying to hit pan on as many
i chose as possible this year and that's
a reason why a lot of these haven't
gotten a ton of love you can just use so
much to highlight anyway I feel like my
collection video is so different than
everyone else's right this is one that
the cover has rubbed off this is from
philosophy and it is the grace
highlighter this powder actually smells
like they're amazing grace fragrance
this one is a really cool one it's more
subtle definitely has like a pinky a
light pinky shift so that's why I've
kept it after so long I used to use this
as my only highlight so I do definitely
have a dip in it the grace is like
almost gone because I've been using it
so much I haven't used it in a long time
but it's definitely different than
anything I have so I've kept it I got
this actually at big lots when they put
a bunch of their cosmetics at Big Lots
so I think I got this really three
dollars I'm gonna save my cream stuff
for last but I have a couple more
powders this is from Sephora 'he's line
this is the color Stardust I used to
have another one from Sephora line and
it was like a pinky shade but I had so
much glitter in it I eventually
declutter dit I feel like these ones are
more of like almost a duochrome like
they have like a heavier shift than a
lot of other highlighters this one's
like a white gold shift really pretty
again it's gold i ordered this online so
it's not like I saw it in person and got
it it's really pretty if you're looking
for a cheaper alternative to a highlight
I think that this one's really really
nice it's similar to mary-lou manizer in
tone it's just like a little more like
greenie gold not like where you're an
insane like golden lizard but it
definitely has a little bit more of that
like green shimmer to it definitely
something different it's nice definitely
um yeah it's just part of my collection
I so so unenthused I promise I like all
these I'm just definitely in my panic
mode right now so I haven't really used
a lot of these in a long time I usually
stick to one for a really long time to
see some progress in it at least as a
plate Lisa my last year probably some of
my mic favorite ones and the most like
pink in town so I do have do yours this
is the diamond rose highlighter I
believe these have been discontinued
which is kind of sad I don't know why
they did that I remember when these are
like the shizz on
youtube this one i have used quite a bit
of i know you can still see the design
but I definitely have used this thing
this is a really pretty pinky toned
highlight I really like it I don't think
you need to like pay crazy prices to get
this but I am glad have in my collection
and i'll definitely continue to use it
and enjoy it and I believe this is my
most recent highlight this is bobby
brown and this is in the color pink glow
I think this is limited edition but I
think you might be able to still get it
i'm not sure it came out with this one
and then like a golden color this one
has definitely glitter in it and it is
more like a metallic it's at the bottom
here such a pretty color i really like
this I almost forget i have this
sometimes because it's so new and again
this year like since the beginning of
the year i've really been focusing on
other highlights but i love this one I
almost forgot this one is from to face
this is the candlelight glow and this is
like a duo one super pretty there's like
a pink and than a white side I know they
have come out with like a darker one
most of the time I swirl this together
but this is another one I've used quite
a bit again because it does have more
like a pinky tone to it I'm just gonna
put it up on my knuckles that's it there
at the top it's just a really pretty one
this one's super pigmented too even
though it's kind of pinky it still has
like a golden green equal 0 to it really
like it I think it's really nice I've
used this probably definitely one of the
most again out of my collection now on
to cream and liquid highlights I only
have three of those the first one here
is from benefit this is the Watts up
highlighter that's what it looks like
this is a really beautiful highlight
although it's golden it doesn't come off
to golden it almost comes off like a
more golden champagne it blends out
really nicely on top of foundation
underneath foundation it's just not
something I normally gravitate to this
was just part of like a birthday gift
from Sephora a couple years ago I
definitely need to get the move on to
get this out of my collection before it
goes bad but I do enjoy it I probably
wouldn't repurchase this is something
from gorgeous cosmetics this is the
superstar liquid shimmer this is like a
peachy color this would be a great mixer
into a foundation if you're go
for really luminous glow that's it there
in the middle it definitely has some
peach color to it so that's why I would
mix it in just because I think it would
add that glow to the foundation without
being like too much color I like it a
lot I got it from work and it's nice I
like it and the last highlighter in my
collection this is benefit typing this
is a classic and what I love about this
is the color of it I wish that there
were more powder highlighters in this
color this is a really pretty light
pinky highlight the form of it is just
what I have an issue with because it's
liquid so this is something I'm trying
to use that by the end of 2016 so I have
been trying to use this like in my
foundation or like underneath my
foundation I do really like it it's just
liquid highlights are just harder for me
to use I don't gravitate to them every
day okay that's my collection guys I
hope you enjoyed it and um stay tuned
for bronzers I'm going to film that next
so you guys will be seeing that soon and
I will see you in my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
