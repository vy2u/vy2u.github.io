Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be continuing on my
collection series so I'm gonna leave the
playlist link down below so you guys can
see what other ones I've done today we
are tackling all my highlighters so this
is the series I started not only to show
you guys what's in my collection not in
a way to brag or anything like that but
just to let you guys know but also
because I want to just have a better
appreciation for the stuff I have I want
to remember what I have I want to touch
it I want to swatch it I want to
appreciate it and this is just helping
me rediscover things that are in my
collection so as you can tell the the
highlighter collection is kind of psycho
I don't know when this happened how it
happened but it did I have some powder
highlights here these are cream
highlighters more powders and then these
are all kind of pallets off to the side
so it's a lot of stuff I'm going to
swatch and go through all of these give
you some mini reviews this might be a
longer video than a lot of the other
ones in the series because it's just a
lot of products so um yeah I think I'm
gonna try to go buy a brand but we'll
see how that goes and let's get into my
highlighters I thought we would start
off with the wet and wild stuff I
realized as I was like getting through
everything that I don't have a ton of
stuff in one like brand but I do have
quite a bit of wet wild so I want to
start off with these mega blow ones
these are really really beautiful and I
think a great drugstore highlighter this
is in the shade blossom glow and it's
absolutely stunning I picked this one up
at the beginning of the year my hand was
still a little wet so that's a bit of a
foiled swatch but uh that's it they're
so freaking gorgeous I love it so much
highly suggest that one this other one
that I have here is from the goth love
graphic collection I do have a whole
review video on that collection if you
want to check it out this one has an
iridescent to it I don't know if it's
gonna pick up on camera it's really
pretty it has like a pinky purple shift
I really enjoyed this one as well and I
think it's a really good one another one
from the Gothic graphic collection is
this one here this is a loose
highlighter so it's a little bit
different this is in the shade it's on
the front this isn't moon tears and I
really really love this
I'm really sad I couldn't find this on
the website so I do think it's going to
actually like stay limited-edition oh
it's so pretty and it has the skull in
it I know that was like a big thing for
everyone so stunning this is one I like
to use a setting spray with to really
like make it not so powdery oh I got a
lot on there but that's a swatch of it
they're so stunning
really really beautiful I'm glad that I
definitely have it because you can't get
on the website and the last one wild
highlighter I have here is the newest
one I actually got this in the mail
today because I got my flights of fancy
collection it oh I was excited anyway I
had to get free shipping and I needed
like literally a penny but I decided to
pick this up this is the technically the
bronzer in reserve your Cabana but
obviously it's a highlighter this is
something that a lot of people know
about a lot of people love okay how do
you open this there we go I picked this
up because I wanted to see what it was
about I had it before but you know that
was awhile ago and I wanted to see if it
really is just that like subtle
highlight it's kind of hard to tell my
hands kind of shiny just from like
wiping off swatches and stuff but I'm
gonna give this a try
see if I like it on the skin I figured
if not it's not like too big of a deal
and I wanted to just kind of reget my
thoughts on this I have two highlighters
from Kiko this is from the free soul
collection it's the shade I think it was
the only highlighter that came in there
because it is a kind of like three
highlighter thing I dropped mine a
little bit and it's kind of busted but
don't mind that I think this is a really
pretty one I do have a review on this
collection and all the items I got from
it the only one that works for my skin
tone is the top shade so that's what I
tend to use it has like a really pretty
golden shift to it but I'll swatch the
other ones the middle shades really
beautiful as well it's just too deep for
me and then the last one I love as well
but again just way too deep for me I've
used these as eyeshadows though and I
find they're really pretty
they just have such a nice shine to them
so that one is really pretty and I keep
it in my collection just for that top
shade the next one here is from the
golden waves collection this one's a bit
newer as well but I do have a
you this is in the golden shade they
have like a rose one as well two of them
came in this collection I think this is
beautiful it's like a baked formula and
this is similar to the other one in tone
because it has like that golden shift
again this is a little bit foiled since
my hand was a little wet but so pretty
really really like this if you want to
see me apply this and it on the skin I
will leave all the videos that I'm
saying that are out there linked down
below so you can check them out I love
that one we'll talk about back to
highlighters next I honestly only have
two at one point in my collection which
I'll leave my other collection videos
linked down below I had way more Becca
but I just tended to not use them so I
declutter it a lot of them this is
Becca's moonstone and this is a classic
shade we all know what this looks like
mine is busted obviously and this is so
pretty it really is I honestly don't
know why I don't reach for it more cuz
it's stunning I need to reach for it
more and the other one I have here is
from there like duochrome type of
collection this one is like something
champagne flashes Bellini or something
like that
my focus is like not working hopefully
you guys can see it it's really pretty I
really enjoyed this shade it's been in a
favorites video I was kind of scared it
was gonna be too dark for me but
honestly it's not it just flashes that
pink and it's so stunning so I really
love this I also love this size of it
it's like perfect not too much and you
know you still feel like you're actually
getting some product so those are my two
Becca highlighters I have two products
in here that are laura geller and this
one is the highlighter in golden rose
it's a mini which I love this size I've
actually used a full size up of the
French vanilla and I have that I have
another one in my kit actually currently
this one is so beautiful it's subtle but
still gives like such a nice radiance to
the skin
it's nothing metallic it's just
beautiful so love that one and then this
is actually a eyeshadow a trio but I
tend to use these shades over here as
highlighter so I mix them it gives me a
little bit of iridescent because there
is some iridescent
that pink shade but again just such a
beautiful glow to the skin I love both
of these I really love the laura geller
formula for any face products honestly I
think she does a great job of creating a
skin like finish that just complements
anyone's skin no matter what age I'll
stop saying skin I know it's creepy I
think the rest of my highlighters are
all kind of random so we'll just take
them as they come this first one here is
ciate London and this was sent to me
more recently I've only used it once but
it's one of those rainbow highlighters
it's interesting one haven't really
delved into these colors or the purple
but I kind of kept my brush in the
middle it was a more neutral look so I
don't know what I should do should I
just swirl that's not really how you do
a rainbow highlighter but there's a
swatch of it I mean it's way more pretty
than you'd think it'd be right so it's
one that's kind of fun and different not
something I would have bought but yeah
I'm trying it out a little bit longer
ooh
next is one of my all-time favorites
this is from Dior this is the Dior nude
air Luminizer in 0-2 pink glow I believe
it's so pretty guys look at it focus
focus focus my friend this is just
absolutely stunning I love it so so much
this is very similar to that white wild
one I'll swatch them next to each other
so you guys can see them so that's it
there oh yeah and then this is that wet
and wild one so that's the wet and wild
one there they're very similar to color
but there's just something about the
Dior one that I do find is special
enough that to me it's worth it I did
get this sent to me so I didn't pay for
it which I feel just lucky as heck about
but I do really love it it was one on my
wish list for a long time next I have an
elf highlighter here this is the
shimmering highlighter powder in the
Pearl glow this is really beautiful I
don't feel like I hear that that much
about these but for six dollars I think
it's a pretty good formula it's a
thicker one so a lot of product goes on
your hand or on your brush or however
you're using it but it's it's really
pretty housing nice nice glow to it I
find the formula is very similar to this
one here from Lancome
I got this sent to me from optionally
and I just feel like when I put my
finger in these they feel so similar the
colors are not the same this is in the
shimmering buff shade but there's
something about them to me that just is
very similar this one obviously though
color wise is like a wider this one's a
little bit more nude and skin like so
you know you don't see it as much on the
skin it's a little more subtle but I
love them they're so pretty both of
these are really beautiful you know I
have those too it's hard because there's
so many great highlighters I feel like
now there's a lot of bad ones but
there's a lot of good ones
we're just trucking on keeping it going
this is probably one of the newer ones
to my collection I purchased this
because of Mariah Leonard she was
talking about these and said they were
really pretty for that like glass-like
finish this is like that big gel a
formula it's like a little bit hard
right now especially because i've
swatched in like taking off so many
things on my hand
I mean you can see my hand it's like
full of shimmer but this strip of
shimmer here this one that is the NARS
it's so pretty it's a little bit dark on
me if I go too heavy-handed but I'm
hoping that first summer with the tan
it'll work out for me so that's what I'm
hoping anyway but I do like this I like
the formula and you can kind of build
this up for something subtle or
something really intense I have four
more single highlighters this next one
is from Too Faced I got this because of
my you decide what I buy so oh you can
see that iridescent so cool this really
is different like no matter where you
swatch it so I'll just kind of go on the
top and bottom I don't know if you can
see how different they are this one's a
lot more blue and this one has like a
pink to it really cool I will you know
be doing that video soon hopefully so
I'm not gonna give too much away next is
a really inexpensive one from essence
it's the pure nude highlighter I believe
they have like some iridescent ones out
now this looks like something that would
be too dark for my skin tone but it
isn't it's the perfect like nude
highlight
that adds a shimmer without being too
light on the skin some highlighters you
can spot a mile away because they're a
couple shades lighter than you know your
skin tone but this one oh it's gorgeous
it's one of my all-time favorites I love
that it's inexpensive it's so so good
highly suggest this one this next
highlighter is one that isn't actually a
highlighter it's an eye shadow and I
love it it's the shade illusion this
came in the blend of a good witch
palette I've sensed a pot of it into
like its own little single thing and I'm
working on finishing it up this year
this is so stunning because it's just
this like natural shine oh it's so
pretty I'm sad that I can't like get
this afterward but I'm also really proud
of myself for finishing this whole thing
up so I've said it before and I'll say
it again I highly suggest looking at
your eyeshadows things that maybe aren't
sparkly enough for your lid might look
beautiful on the skin if you want to try
to find a way to repurpose powders or
different makeup items in your
collection loved this and I'm really
glad that I didn't get rid of it and the
last single highlighter here is from
Bobbi Brown this is in the shade pink
glow I remember I wanted this so so bad
I had it sent to my mom's house right
around Christmas time not last year but
the year before this is really pretty it
just is a little sparkly I don't know
what it is about this you would think I
would love it
but it's like a little too sparkly for
me it looks so beautiful in the swatch
I'm monitor right now I'm like oh it's
beautiful
I don't know what it is about it why I
don't use it more especially because I
love that Dior one and this seems like
it'd be similar in formula and color and
everything but yeah I need to bust this
out more it's beautiful
it feels beautiful it's great quality
and it's expensive so I need to use it
randomly real fast I'm just gonna bring
this guy up this is from least watch a I
believe you can get this like way easier
in Canada but this is like a shimmer
spraying type of thing I'm not gonna
spray it cuz I don't want to get
anything on my lens
but yeah that's it I don't really use it
much I got this in a wantable box super
cute right but kind of weird and a
little bit extra I guess let's go into
the pallets that I have because I have
quite a few this first one here is from
Oprah and this is the feeling yourself
oh no feeling myself Oh
this is the feeling myself palette even
though the MS upside down why is that is
that like supposed to be that's weird
okay anyway the feelin myself palette
this has three of their like really well
selling shades this is blissful I
believe pillow talk and Rodeo Drive so
I'm doing this again for the UMaine
highlighters you made me by type of
thing so yeah I am working on testing
this out so I can get a review up for
you guys next we have a lot of
holographic iridescent type of stuff so
just hold on this is the Kat Von D
alchemist palette oh I didn't swatch
these oops sorry guys let me swatch this
really fast the only one that really
works on my skin tone is pillow-talk
which is the middle one that's blissful
this is pillow talk and then this is
Rodeo Drive which is a bit more golden
they're really really stunning I
especially love them with a settings
remove it I'll stop talking about this
moving back to the Kat Von D Alchemist
palette it's kind of hard to see the
difference in like what these are but
these are some really pretty duochrome
colors there's a purple a pink green and
kind of a blueish one let's see this is
like my wet hand so they look crazy
right now I should have waited a second
in the light for me they look so cool
hopefully we can get this to show so
that's a swatch of them there they have
like this amazing reflex so pretty I you
can really see them I hope I really
think it's make it look at that one ah
so burner it's like a teal love this so
beautiful there's no shimmer no glitter
it's just a beautiful shine alright next
I want to show you guys the honest hacia
moonchild palette this is kind of like
the first one of its kind again we have
those iridescent shades I'm sure you
guys have seen this a billion times so
I'm not gonna like talk about it too too
much so those are the first three and
the roast watched these are all more
cool toned and then let's swatch the
other ones we have the pink heart Lucky
Clover and the blue moon my hand is a
little tiny bit white not too much
so those are the other ones these are
really beautiful I find that this
formula is a little bit thicker than the
Kat Von D one and also has a little bit
more of like a glitter to it but I still
really enjoy this palette I think it's
still really great plus you get the
other two shades if those actually
interests you something a bit new to my
collection but in the holographic or
iridescent duochrome realm this is the
Naked cosmetics holographic highlighter
palette I bought this in a boxy charm
and I think it's really nice for a boxy
charm item I'm like happy to have it
these are a bit more powdery as you can
see there but I find they blend out on
the cheek and on the skin really nicely
these also have like a way higher shine
so there those are this one like only
shines sometimes and then it kind of
looks like peachy it's really cool and
then this bottom row has a green a blue
and then a gold
there's swatches of that palette these I
find just definitely translate that
color more than the other two palettes I
have two more I guess we'll just
continue on which kind of these more
colored crazy highlighters this is
taking up so much of the screen it's the
backlight palette from BH Cosmetics I
really wanted to pick this up and this
is in food this is so freakin pigmented
this is not for the light of heart it's
crazy so let me just you need the
tiniest amount of this and it's just
crazy it's crazy how pigmented this
thing is so you definitely need like T's
just like a light hand but you know you
can repurpose these shadows because of
that as well
so that's kind of nice I mean this is
the most blinding like white highlighter
I've ever seen this is the one that
doesn't have as much like pigment base
to it as the other ones but yeah that is
the black light palette definitely I
mean really really pretty just
definitely intense and my last like
highlighter palette type of thing is the
Glo kit sweets from Anastasia I didn't
actually buy this one Sam was lucky
enough to get this for free because
anastacio does their conferences at his
hotel sometimes anyway so this has a
four different shade
this is an interesting palette I don't
think this is like a normal highlighting
palette so let me try to get the water
off my hands so it's a little bit more
true this is marshmallow it has an
insane shift to it it's like crazy so
super beautiful that's like really the
only one that works as a highlighter on
me
this is sassy grape which is stunning as
a you know color it's just you know an
unusable shade for me as a highlighter
this is so chunky this is butterscotch
but blend it out it's beautiful and then
last we have the shape taffy and this
definitely has some like sparkle glitter
to it so those are some swatches of that
palette I feel like if you have the
medium to medium dark or dark skin tone
these might you know look like a million
times better on you then on me as actual
highlights but this sassy grape is so
pretty so yeah I keep that anyway even
though I don't use it all the time and
last year we have the creams I have
quite a few of these just as of recently
I feel like I've picked up or collected
quite a few of them but let's get into
them really fast and that's it that's
all I have oh you know let's start off
with the color pop ones this is in the
shade flexitarian this is in the shade
over the moon again I'm using this for
that video on highlighter so I'll swatch
that for you guys so that's it they're
really really pretty like just a really
beautiful hi there and then over the
moon is more of like a glittery
duochrome type of situation yeah lots of
glitter in that one but yeah so I have
those two highlighters from colour-pop
those have like a mu C cream type of
formula next I have two of the vilest
healthy glow highlighters from covergirl
I got sent that big PR package so I did
get all of them but these are the only
two that I have kept in my own
collection this is the shade number one
this is one that in the swatch it looks
absolutely beautiful and I want to love
it so much and want to be able to
recommend it but honestly I just don't
love the formula of these this is
something I keep because I have it and
you know it's pretty but nothing there
and by if I didn't get it this one is
number three and it's a little bit dark
for me but I like using this on my
eyeballs as a really pretty cream shadow
so those are from covergirl those are
the Vitamix healthy little highlighters
this one from Marc Jacobs is kind of
getting up there I probably should get
rid of it soon this is a really pretty
highlighter it's in the shade glow stick
it has such a beautiful glow to it
that's it just applied straight from the
tube but you can obviously blend that
out this is just like ten million times
better than that covergirl one there's
no sparkle and glitter to it it's just
this beautiful shine really really loved
it I need to use this more I need to use
it this summer maybe I should bring this
with me to Italy and like use it like as
a body highlight pour more we're so
close let's talk about this wet and wild
one this is from the Gothic graphic
collection and it's like this purpley
type of situation it's fine it's not my
favorite it's a little bit greasy you
know whatever I don't know if this is
what you're into great but I just feel
like I can get this with powder I don't
need this I'll probably be decluttering
this at some point soon all right this
next full-sized one we have here is from
CIT London it's the Dewey Stix and this
is different than any of the other
highlighters I have in my collection
this is gonna give you like a what dewy
look to the skin it's a very interesting
product I think it's a very like
editorial type of product if you're
looking for that type of glow or you
have really dry skin maybe you don't set
your foundation with a powder it's
beautiful it's just kind of difficult to
work and I have Olli skin so it's a
little bit harder for me but I do really
like it I think it's a really awesome
product all right I have some minis here
this is from Tarte it's the TARDIS pro
glow in the shade Stena this is just
like glitter bomb came out and said hi
but the next one's even more so I guess
you know it's pretty I don't think it's
anything that's special I mean it looks
so like when highlighters hit the light
they just look so pretty right yeah it's
pretty don't get me wrong it's a little
dark for my skin I keep it because I
like it but I don't reach for it a ton
and then this is from cover effects and
this is the glitter drop so I put this
in my highlighter drawer because I don't
know where else to put this dang thing
this is so glittery oh my gosh it's
crazy it's beautiful though it really is
a beautiful product it's just like where
do you wear that it's crazy look at that
this is in the shade Mirage they're like
three different shades it's the most
neutral one beautiful though I mean
beautiful for the right occasion and the
right thing yes but you know there's
only so many of those so this is like
the perfect size oh my gosh I just
realized I didn't show you guys this one
this is a palette from kiss and this is
the halo strobing palette I really
really like this this is in the light
shade and all of these work for my skin
tone which I love so I'll swatch this
really fast I don't know how I forgot
this my hands a little wet I'm sorry
guys so that's it they're really pretty
no Sparkle just a really beautiful shine
and this isn't anything that's gonna be
too crazy on the skin I like that I can
kind of get something natural if I want
to but you can build it up do a little
you know spritzing with your setting
spray and get some more shine out of
them if you want that I did get the sent
to me from octa Lee from kiss but it's
something I've enjoyed since I've had in
my collection which has been a while
it's a good one
alright guys well I hope you enjoyed my
highlighter collection I am sufficiently
shimmered out I have so much shimmer
everywhere
but I do I love the highlighters I feel
like for a while I was like I don't get
it I don't need a lot but obviously I do
because this is a freaking crap ton of
highlighters I didn't even count them I
don't want to know it's too many and I
love them mostly all of them at some
point I use them I just enjoy them so I
hope you guys enjoyed if you think
there's a highlighter out there that I
would really like of course let me know
in the comments and that's everything
thank you so much for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
