line thanks so much for watching we are
moving on with my declutter and we are
going to be decluttering highlighters
today I've talked about highlighters a
lot and how I'm not the biggest fan of
them so I'm going to try to be pretty
good I have put everything that was in
my kit as well as anything in my
personal collection in these two bins so
this is every highlighter I have I
decided since you there's powder
products and it's okay if they get mixed
up because you can easily sanitize them
I would just put them all together if
you've watched the other two cutters
that I've done you guys know that I'm
focusing on getting rid of old stuff as
well as not letting my kit kind of be a
crutch for me so honestly if I'm keeping
it for my kit I need it to be a newer
item in my collection I also need it to
be something that I actually would want
to use and not just keeping it as like I
might use it in my kit I really don't
want that to be a thing I say you know I
don't want to be wasteful and have to
repurchase stuff too cuz I'm getting rid
of stuff but I also don't want to keep
stuff that I'm never going to use and I
try to be more realistic in that way
anyway let's just get into it we're
going to start with this bucket first
first at the top I have some Becca
highlighters so this person here is rose
gold I believe from Becca and I've never
used that I've has it's her forever it's
too dark for my skin tone it's like a
rosy coppery gold color and yeah I'm not
going to ever use it I'm not going to
use it on clients it's beautiful but
it's just not something I'm going to use
so I'm going to actually be getting rid
of that this is the color champagne pop
from Becca and this one again it's very
pretty but it's too dark for my skin
tones this is what I might actually want
in my kit I don't know I'm going to put
this to the side as a maybe I I've just
never used it just over such a weight
reserve but this is a maybe there's
maybe this is moonstone from Becca I do
like this one mine exactly a little bit
cracked so I'm going to be keeping this
I think it's really pretty it's not too
dark on my skin so yeah really really
pretty so now my favorite highlights are
from laura geller this one here is one
I'm working on in French Renault
and it is almost done so I'm obviously
keeping that I have another one of the
small and in French vanilla I have this
in my kit and I'm going to probably keep
it in there just because this is just a
nice one for a subtle boil or for a more
mature skin if you're not trying to
bring out texture everything this is
beautiful and then this other one is in
golden rose and it is just so beautiful
I really like that as well this was in a
favorites video things are just more
subtle something I'm more into
personally so I'm going to keep I also
like that they're in a small size
because I don't need a huge one like if
I can save money and buy the small one I
think that that's awesome this is a
Sephora brand highlighter and it is in
the color Stardust
I have something really similar to this
it's like I own white that flashes gold
and I'm just going to get rid of this I
don't need it I don't use it so it's a
nice formula if you're looking for a
cheaper like alternative to something
like that but I don't need it I have a
couple cream highlighters here this is
the Marc Jacobs one I got this in an
enforcer box and I keep this in my kit
I'm going to continue to keep this in my
kit it's really nice and it's not too
old or anything and it's nice I've
really not ever used it but I like to
have at least one option so I'm going to
keep that this rns lime is really really
pretty I think this is a great Luminizer
if you're looking for something that
just kind of almost looks dewy on the
skin but it's not too like what looking
just so pretty but this is too old I
really didn't get any use out of it I
got this in one of my boxes so it's just
way too old gotta go this is an
eyeshadow it's from Starbucks in the
color pearl
I am Panamint this year I use it as a
highlighter i also use it on the lid
i do really like this and i'm going to
keep it to continue to pan it I have
another Becca highlighter here this is
just a small mini of opal once again
this is such a pretty pretty shade I
need to repress it obviously if I'm
going to keep it but I'm going to put
this in a maybe pile I have quite a few
it is really pretty obviously this would
be for my kit and not for myself but I
do have quite a few of the anasazi aglow
kit so I'm going to kind of see if these
two match anything in those and if they
do or if they don't we'll go from there
I have a palette here at the bottom this
is the Kat Von D Alchemist palette I do
like this
now I don't know which one I like better
this or the moon child which I also have
but I'm going to be keeping this I like
using these as eyeshadows as well I like
the whole duochrome thing so I will be
keeping that this is kind of a weird one
this is like a body mist from Lise
watching I am going to be keeping this I
like using this like for weddings or
anything like that and it's just a nice
little presentation just everything
about it I like and yeah I'm in keep it
this is the Bobbi Brown pink glow
highlighter and this is definitely
shimmery for me I usually don't do
anything quite this intense as you can
see but I do really like the color of it
it's light enough for me I like that
it's kind of pink so I will be keeping
that this is a Laura Mercier highlighter
and this one is really nice as well but
as you can tell it is a little dark for
me I will be keeping this because it's
absolutely beautiful and it's one of the
ones I feel like I could also use in my
kit and I feel really happy to be having
this in my kids so I'm going to keep
that I feel like both of those already
are telling me without even doing
swatches with my cool kits that I can
get rid of these I'm going to pass these
on and then this one's going to probably
be a sad story this is the Dior pink
what is this diamond Rose a highlighter
this is just too old at this plane I
really should get rid of it then
discontinued for quite a while and
honestly I feel like the Bobbi Brown one
is very comparable so I don't think I'll
be missing it I'm sad this is like
something I remember buying and really
you know being excited about but it's
time for it to move on guys I am doing a
savage I think I'm doing a very very
very good job this is what I've gotten
rid of just in that one and a lot of
those are planned as heck so I know
these back in here is a part of me is
like you know it's a little bit sad at
first but really honestly I'm going to
be so much happier when all the stuff in
here is actually stuff I like you know
and I'm excited to use it so excited to
like talk to you guys about and they're
not just kind of like taking up space
because they're expensive
whatever so we are moving on to this one
we'll see how I do
palette wise I'm going to be keeping the
moon child I really do like this palette
I have quite a few dips going in it
again I like the whole duochrome Kenneth
Banco nom so I will be keeping that so
these are the flow palettes I was
talking about I have the gleam glow
palette which I believe is discontinued
now I really like this one this one's
good for me but again these are
basically for my kit I do in mind sign
but I'm stuffing out herself
I got these actually all for free
because um Sam works in hotels and they
do they're like quarterly or like
seasonal conference at the hotel he
works up so he got a swag bag hooked me
up and yeah I'm like super lucky so
anyway I feel like these are
highlighters that I could use on
everyone I love the formula of these
this is the little kit so this would be
for like darker skin tones or just like
warmer toned highlighters and then this
is the sweet so this one is definitely a
bit different I feel like this is like
crazy as I go and then this is the one I
was talking about for like that like
gold white shift really pretty so on as
well just keep all of these and I feel
like this will cover my kit right like
how many more highlighters do you
freakin you this is a newer highlighter
to my collection this is the essence
pure nude really like this I think it's
really really pretty you're looking for
something that drugstore it might look
like it's going to be a little too dark
for your skin if you're lighter but this
actually sheers out and looks really
nice on skin so I really like that I am
going to keep it this is one of my
favorite highlighters as well this is
the bare minerals the love-affair
highlighter this is a bit old and I have
hit pan on it which is exciting yeah I
just like it I don't think I'm even
though it's older I wouldn't use it in
my kit but I don't think I can get rid
of it yeah they're slightly different
this has a little bit more like a gold
reflex to it so I'm going to keep both
of those let me break some stuff see
we're getting to the ones these are ones
they use a lot so this is from
philosophy this is the amazing grace
highlighter I know it looks like super
weird and
I have been tempted so many times to get
rid of this but it just gives like this
really subtle pink glow like so subtle
and I like it
I do I just I don't know what it is it
just like highlights the face so nicely
so I'm like I'm going to keep this one
which again it there's me I am going to
keep this one again it is older but I
think it's worth it and something I will
use some Akitas we have three more
highlighters to go yeah let's see if I
can get rid of one of these this is the
Too Faced candlelight glow and I've had
this for quite a while that's what it
looks like it's just getting a little
old it's pretty intense
it's not necessarily my favorite it's
not like ugly but I think I am going to
actually pass this one on just because
this isn't like my preferred method of
highlighting and if I really really
wanted that like gold shift again I have
it in this week's collection so I'm
going to actually pass that on this is
from Laura Geller it's actually an
eyeshadow trio but I use the sides on
this to create a highlight and it's
absolutely stunning I think it's really
pretty it's hard to see I'm sorry guys
my lighting I'm trying to figure it out
it's just not really working so I'm
going to keep this this is what I've
been using probably the most lately
super pretty and last this is a very
Luminizer I think I want to keep this
too I have had in a while but such a
classic and it is really pretty if
you're like if I want to go for like
that more beaming highlight I have this
or I have the moonstone I know those are
kind of similar but I am going to keep
this as well so these are all pirates
and keeping not only for myself but also
for my make a kit I feel very happy
about this
all of these are newer except for like
the ones I truly truly love and I
obviously I'm only going to be using on
myself I'm really happy about that
and this is the bucket of highlighters
I'm getting rid of I didn't know how
many I would be like passing on so I
feel very happy about that especially
these expensive ones like these too I
probably could have done but I feel like
this is really where we're getting to
something you know so I'm I'm especially
happy about getting rid of these better
ones I'm not a super crazy fan of the
Becca highlighters I think they're
pretty don't get me wrong but I
feel like something that is the most
important when you have when you're
shopping for highlighters especially
just for yourself is that you don't need
a million different tones of highlight
you need a couple like they definitely
need to be light enough for a skin tone
and these just aren't for me and that's
okay they need we need different shades
for different people
but that doesn't mean you should own all
of them because you're just one person
anyway this one too man
how is that is that but it's fine and
now makeup expires that's the thing I
don't want to be so attached to products
that are just like rotting in my drawers
because I'd rather have like stuff that
is new and not going to like potentially
be dangerous you know there's no reason
for that so that is everything thank you
so much for watching guys and we're
going to be moving on to blushes and
bronzers today I'm going to try to do
everything while I'm feeling it I want
to move on a feeling this mostly 182
reference but I'm really excited and I
really just am in a good mindset so I
feel like it's best to just power
through get where you can go on while
you have the energy so thanks so much
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
