learned thank you so much for watching
I'm feeling quite a few videos today I'm
filming for which I try to do like three
max and I don't know the order I'm gonna
put them in but anyway I hope you don't
mind staring at the same I look I was
inspired to create this kind of like
holiday makeup shopping guide tips and
tricks what I think you should consider
before you go and buy this holiday
makeup that's coming out because while I
was doing my to talk and while you guys
have been leaving amazing comments on
the makeup addiction tube talk I just
did
I think it's just kind of important to
have a dialogue and sometimes you just
need that extra little voice of reason
to be like you're right you're right
okay it's everything's okay so these are
my tips and tricks to help you shop
holiday sales to help you shop holiday
releases and collections and little kits
I honestly do think that holiday is a
great time to buy you're gonna get the
best bang for your buck especially if
things are the same formulas as they
normally are then you really are getting
an amazing deal but that doesn't mean
that you should just go crazy and buy
everything and I'm really hoping this
will help narrow down the items that
you're actually really wanting that
aren't just hype that will fit into your
collection in your daily makeup routine
really well and that you'll be really
happy with six months down the line once
you bought them and tested them and use
them I have a list here of some items I
think have seven different kind of like
things you should think about or just
like things to mention so first off I
know this seems like so simple and like
duh but you don't need everything you
don't need everything so much is gonna
come out guys and I know it's going to
be tempting I know that the deals are
pretty good and if you can get a coupon
or this or whatever it is it can make
you want to buy more but you don't need
everything so be picky pick the things
that are gonna make you happy that are
gonna fit into your collection and that
you're gonna love because you don't need
at all number two I think determining
why you really want something is super
important so why do you want this is it
because it's new is it because it's from
your favorite brand is it because it's
limited edition is it because of all the
hype and because you've seen your
favorite youtubers use it what is it
that's your main driving force to want
this item and if it's something
Packaging or if it's something like hype
maybe kind of hold off or do a little
bit more research or really really ask
yourself really what is going on
sorry little black eyed peas um but no
really ask yourself like why you want
this item and if it actually is
something that you like and not just
something that everyone else is talking
about and sometimes that can be hard to
differentiate when it's in the middle of
all the madness and the chaos of
something releasing but it's okay to
like take a step back I know a lot of
these releases are already launching now
for holiday but not everything is gonna
sell out really fast so keep that in
mind number three so once you've
determined yeah kind of do you want this
I think it's important to think about
what you have in your collection and if
it's different than what you already
have in your collection
and also if it's different than what
they've put out in the past if they've
put out a palette like this last year in
the year before that maybe it's not as
important for you to get because you
know at some point later down the line
if you really really wanted it it's
probably going to come back in a
different form kind of like a
reincarnation of this palette I feel
like tart and two-faced that's what they
do they reincarnate their palettes every
single holiday season so you know take
into consideration if this is something
that you probably could get later down
the line or if it's something that you
can already dupe in your own collection
I have a whole let stupid series I'm
very much into duping things and just
shopping your own stash on my channel so
check those videos out or check other
people's videos out like that because a
lot of the times these browns and
neutral colors can be duped in your
collection already which doesn't mean
you shouldn't buy it because sometimes
the way they're configured or I don't
know do something about it really does
fit your lifestyle and I get that too
but that isn't always the case and you
can eliminate a lot of unnecessary
purchases by you know making sure it's
something you really want and you don't
already have duplicates in your
collection my number four tip to stay
away from our volts you don't need them
do not get them do not buy every
lipstick in a collection please my god
please do not buy every single blush in
the collection I've done it I bought the
huge Tarte
cheek stain vault cheek stay involved
like I look back on that and I'm like
why did I spend $150 on eight cheek
stains cheek stains there are even
powder blushes what in the hell so
definitely stay away from vault I do not
think that they are good deals I don't
think you need all of these products
especially when it comes to lip products
they're gonna expire in like um like a
two year period or so you guys there's
no way you can get through them if
you've ever tried to pan a lipstick you
know even if you picked your top five
like favorite shades from the lipstick
line you're probably gonna be saving
half of the money like only spending
about a hundred dollars and you can
reasonably actually use those and enjoy
them whereas if you had 15 yeah it's a
great deal because they were only two
hundred fifty dollars and it would have
been five hundred but there's no way
you're going to use it and you're just
you're just wasting your money you're
wasting products it's just wasteful it's
not needed
no one needs it I'm a makeup artist I
don't need it please stay away from the
vaults don't do it don't do it don't do
it you don't need it please don't do it
please Oh number five is kind of similar
to the vault but this is in general you
don't need the whole collection so for
example two fates just came out with
their peach collection and I think it's
tempting in this like YouTube mentality
to want it all to want the whole
collection to want every little piece of
it so you have it it's like a whole
family or let's say a Naked palette
comes out or a vice palette that's a
good one let's say but a vice palette
comes out this holiday season and you
have all the other vice palettes you
don't need to get that to complete the
collection really again you're looking
at these items individually singularly
with blinders on except for your own
collection area to have check that out
too and cross-reference but is this
something you wanted without all the
hype without all another crap is this
singular item something you actually
like and will actually use number six I
think is something that might be a
little bit hard but I think it's good so
knowing what you think is gonna actually
sell out and what you think isn't so for
example the maybe the local palette sold
out it's gone that one was a good
purchase if you made that purchase it
was a good one I haven't
I'm so happy that I have it and that I
got it before it sold out but there are
other collections and palettes
throughout holiday that don't sell out
ever feel like most of urban decay stuff
never actually sells out
I feel like two-faced stuff doesn't
necessarily sell it out or it lasts a
little bit longer than the season tart
stuff usually lasts into the season so I
think it's kind of important to rank
what you do want and in order of what
you think is going to sell out the
fastest or what you think is most
important to what you want to actually
buy so that way you are getting the
actual items you want and they're not
selling out and on top of that you're
not buying something that you could buy
four months from now or even after
holiday on sale if you can help it so I
know that can be hard if it's like your
favorite thing from everyone's
collections is something that is like
urban decay and might be there in four
months but you really wanted that's
worth it but I think it's something to
consider and last because it's not all
negative again I told you I like
shopping holiday it's my favorite thing
but minis are your friends that is the
best part about holidays that you can
get so many awesome kits for such an
amazing price and I know it can seem
like you don't want minis you want
full-size products you want a ton of
stuff but it's so hard to go through
makeup guys again if you're on pan and
community you know this but it is tough
to go through even minis of lipsticks
it's tough to go through minis of
highlighters mini powder products
honestly it is so so difficult so don't
let something being miniature deter you
from buying it when you can get a really
good deal and I promise you it's gonna
last you a really long time and even if
it doesn't if it's something that you
can purchase outside of the collection
at any time of the year then you already
know you love it and can purchase that
item with a really good conscience
knowing like yeah I love this product I
was gonna say something else about
minions but I totally forgot right now I
don't know I just think minis are
awesome so like for one of my examples
for this is that cover Texas coming up
like essentially a vault of all they're
like color effects like enhancer
highlighter drops I promise I know what
this stuff is anyway they're coming out
with like the full sizes of it for 250
and then they're come
with like a little kit of four or five
for like 45 like why would you buy the
full-size I have no idea why anyone
would buy full-sizes those that's just
like an example of like the value there
you can get all these different ones
I know steel is coming out with their
glitter eyeshadows that everyone went
crazy over I'm probably gonna pick that
up because why would you not want the
minis who's ever gonna go through a
full-size of those no one so why not
pick them up when they're minis get a
bunch of different colors and you have
more variety in your collection for a
really great price and I really think
that's the key to shopping holiday is
getting the most bang for your buck for
your collection without having full
sizes and all this extra product you're
not going to use that leave your tips
and tricks for shopping holiday down
below these are just the ones that came
to mind when I was thinking about this
in conjunction with project panning and
just trying to be a better consumer I
know that the holidays can be just like
a crazy time of buying and a frenzy of
everything but you can you know get some
really awesome things that you love and
buy some things you're gonna treasure
but also stay away from the crap because
there is a lot of crap that comes out
and again just thinking about what you'd
be happy with this purchase six months
down the road that is a really really
good question to ask yourself when
you're thinking about getting something
I hope this helps thank you so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
