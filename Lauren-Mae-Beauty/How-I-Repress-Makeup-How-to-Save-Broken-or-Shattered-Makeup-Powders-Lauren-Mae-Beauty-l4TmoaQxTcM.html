salina thanks so much for watching today
I'm going to show you guys how I repress
products you can do this with any type
of powder product whether you've used it
to the rim and it's starting to crack or
you've broken a shadow or something like
that this is how you can repress it and
save it so you can actually use it up
the things you're gonna need you're
gonna need some alcohol this one's 91%
and I just use that in my kit for my
alcohol palettes that's why this one's
like kind of dirty but anyway you're
gonna need alcohol I like to use this
like little spatula type of thing I'm
gonna leave this link down below if you
want to get it they're really
inexpensive but again since I'm a makeup
artist this is readily available you can
use whatever you have though
welllook products already going
everywhere this brush I'm actually just
gonna be using it for the end because
some of these products have a bit of
powder in them the same with this I'm
just gonna be using this to kind of like
stamp down once we get there you're
gonna need some paper towel and then
whatever products that you want to
repress so yeah we're gonna start with
one I'll show you guys what it looks
like and then we'll just kind of speed
through this one I think I can't really
swim in anymore so what I do first is
I'm going to just kind of break apart
all of the product that's there I know
this seems too counterintuitive because
we want to repress but you want to break
up all this product so that it's like a
loose powder and then you can repress it
all together once again with the alcohol
so I just break down and you want to try
to like get rid of any chunks so that's
what I'm doing now I'm gonna go through
and just break this powder down
all right once I have the product broken
down I like to kind of mix it to the
middle now I've seen the beauty news
girls they put it in a separate little
like cute little scientific beaker thing
um I just I never do that I was like
tempted to try it but for this I'm just
gonna go with what I know so what I do
is kind of like try to get it all into
the center of the pan there like a
million tutorials on this so like you
know this is just the way I do it and
you're gonna want to add the alcohol and
the biggest thing is you just don't want
to add too much alcohol you want to make
this a paste and not something super
runny so I suggest just going slow and
kind of mixing as you go so that you
don't add too much I wish I had a little
like a dropper thing that would be
amazing right about now so right what
I'm gonna do is just try to be really
really gentle and just put a little bit
of product this alcohol into the bands
all right so I poured some in and now
I'm going to mix up that alcohol with my
powder and try to kind of get a paste
going and you'll know once everything's
incorporated that you've added enough
whoo okay I kind of added too much so I
think I'm right about it too much but
let's just see
not quite but see how it's kind of
starting to like clump that's a good
thing
I'm gonna add oh just a tiny bit more
alcohol we're almost there guys all
right so that's looking pretty good now
I'm gonna take all this and put it in
the center and try to kind of just make
it as flat as possible before we go in
and really press it with our paper towel
and the bottom of that Saturday skin
product
so it's messy but that's what it looks
like so I'm gonna take a paper towel now
I like to set it over and then I like to
just find anything that how they flat
into it to really press the product if
you don't press it down if you don't
press the product down it's not going to
you know stay together very well it's
gonna be really powdery which it already
has a tendency to do after you repress
it so I highly suggest just finding
something within your collection of
products or whatever you have at home to
just kind of press down and it also
smooths it out and everything like that
so if you're gonna do a single eyeshadow
that's like the classic circle I suggest
sanitizing a quarter or something about
that size and then using that to repress
so that's what my product looks like now
and it should be a lot easier to use and
hopefully it won't be crumbling away
like it was that was my issue with this
so that's my butter bronzer done and
next I'm gonna show you guys how to do
this one but I'm just gonna speed it up
so yeah
so that's the finished product actually
added a little bit too much alcohol to
that but it still worked out fine I like
to let these dry overnight before I use
them and just so you know your powder is
gonna look a little bit darker because
it's wet but it will dry back to the
original color and that's kind of it I
know this is kind of a sloppy little
tutorial I'm not the best at it but this
is how I do it I thought since I had to
repress some stuff and a few of you guys
asked how I do it I would just film it
for you guys so I hope this helped at
all it's not gonna be for everyone a lot
of people in my project pan we're like
just throw that away but I want to use
all of it why would I just I'm not the
type of person I was gonna throw away
the powder at the ring if I know how I
can actually use that product so anyway
I hope this helped thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
