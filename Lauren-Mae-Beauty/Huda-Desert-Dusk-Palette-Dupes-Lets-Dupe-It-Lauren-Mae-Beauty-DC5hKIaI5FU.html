Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm doing a new let stupid and
this is gonna be on the hood of beauty
desert dust palette if you haven't seen
it let's do pit before this is just
where I try to inspire you guys to go
within your collections and find shadows
that are similar to colors and palettes
that are coming out in the beauty
community I will leave the playlist link
down below if you want to check out
other ones that I've done in the past
but these here are my dupes for the
hooda palette this palette is absolutely
beautiful and I am trying so hard to
tell myself I don't need it because
hello I have a whole bunch of shadows
right here in front of me that look very
very similar to what's in the palette so
we're gonna get into what my dupes are I
also have some bonus shadows I usually
have some of those and then if you want
to see how I got this look I will leave
the get ready with me linked down below
I am wearing a different look because
I've been out and had to go to the bank
and do other things so I decided to put
a new look product on that I got in the
mail anyway enough of that one last
thing before we get into the dupes I
will say that I obviously do not own
this palette so any of the colors that I
pick are just based off of swatches that
I have and what I have in my collection
these are all single shadow so you can
buy each of them individually and
sometimes if I don't have something very
similar I just pick something that I
think would be fun or that I think keeps
the spirit of the palette alive so if
you're looking for exact exact dupes
some of these might work but some of
these might not this is just kind of
like my interpretation of that palette
based on what I have in my collection
let's get into it
my duke before the first shadow in the
palette is issues from colour-pop this
is a really pretty matte peach color and
it just gives that perfect subtle amount
of warmth you can definitely go with
something like honest osseous orange
soda or makeup geek speech smoothie or
even go with a light matte cream shade
this is just what I thought fits the
palette the best from what I had but
those other colors would definitely work
really well if you already have them in
your collection
my next do before the palette is the
color bel-air again from colour-pop
this is a really pretty matte brown it
kind of rides the line between warm and
cool I sometimes find that it looks cool
in my crease sometimes it's
a little bit warm it just depends on
what I pair it with so I guess you would
call that just kind of neutral a neutral
Brown I really do like this shadow I
think it's really nice and creamy you
could do something like makeup geeks
creme brulee that one's pretty similar
as well the next tip I have and I
believe this is the dupe for Eden and
the palette is the color flower boy
again from colour-pop I have a feeling
that this might be discontinued I don't
know color pop like just randomly
discontinues things if I can find
something else similar or if you have
something similar down below definitely
leave it for everyone else but from my
collection this is what I have that's
the most similar this definitely has a
lot more pink in it and not as much
peach it's not a perfect dupe by any
means it is matte I do really like this
color I did use it in this look today
Eden and the palette is so beautiful and
I would love to have that color in my
collection I just don't think I can
justify the whole palette based off of
like one matte peach color that I'm sure
I could find elsewhere if I really
looked so anyway this one is really
pretty and I think it serves me just as
well in this palette with the other
shadows keeping on with mattes the next
color I have is the color maple from
luck see beauty I do have a whole
dedicated beauty brand spotlight on look
see I will leave that link down below if
you want to check out more about their
shadows this is an absolutely beautiful
color it's a really deep and rich like
terracotta color nice and warm and brown
it's perfect for fall it goes with so
many colors it looks great with these
purples and oranges and like pinky Reds
but it also would look so great with
olives or yellow mustard colors as well
just such a beautiful color my next do
for the palette is the color red stone
from Coastal Scents this one does have a
shimmer to it this is a really nice
metallic from Coastal Scents and this
would look so great on the lid blended
out with some of the other mattes I've
already mentioned that one definitely is
more of a brown red it's not going to be
super bright
it definitely has Brown to it it almost
has a shift like it shifts Brown and
then has like a flash of red it's very
subtle it's not super intense but it's
really beautiful alright next we have
the color cherry cola
I love the shadow I feel like this isn't
so many of my let's dip it's because
it's just beautiful it's from a cupcake
and it is a matte shade it's perfect for
deepening up any look
here I love it it's great we've talked
about it a million times
definitely suggested moving on to the
next row of the pallet the next group is
the color bohemian from look see beauty
I did initially use this on my lid today
but I don't know I just went with other
things I was kind of all over the place
and I was creating this look I didn't
know what I was gonna do when I went
into it so that situation has nothing
against this shadow it's a super
beautiful shadow very very sparkly and
shimmery so that's something you're
looking for I do suggest this I
definitely find you get the best results
if you have a base or if you use mac
fix+ and foilage but this one is
absolutely stunning and I think it'll
give that very shimmery look that those
shadows look like they have in the
palette I do have a bonus shade for that
this is the color obsessed it's so very
similar to the one I just showed you
it's just kind of like a shade lighter
absolutely stunning still has that
really like foiled glittery look to it
so if that's what you're looking for and
that's what's gravitating you to this
palette I do suggest checking out look
CPU these eyeshadows my next Duke for
the palette is the color magic act from
makeup geek this is a very metallic
light gold shade really really pretty
the color in the palette has a little
bit more I think sparkle to it than just
metallic but I thought with what I have
this would look really nice the next
shade is one of the most beautiful
shades in the palette it's one of my
favorites but I do have quite a few
dupes for this one this is the color
duper star from look see beauty you
could also use black light from makeup
geek or Urban Decay's tonic I have all
three of those and they all are the same
shade this is one of my favorite types
of duo chromes where it's that really
warm purple but then it has that blue
violet shift to it it's absolutely
stunning I suggest all three of those I
do think that I like tonic the best it's
the first one that I had but makeup
geeks black light and this one duper
star from look see beauty they're both
really affordable if you're looking for
this color because I know this one is a
lot of people's favorite out of the
palette next is such a beautiful color
this is the shade 143 from colour-pop I
highly suggest this color outside of
this palette but I do think it works
really really nice shout out to a
subscriber for telling me about this as
one of the dupes so I do think it works
really well I do have it on my outer
corner today it's a matte shade as well
which I absolutely
so if you were looking for that purple I
think it's called amethyst in the
palette you would definitely really like
this shade and you can get it for I
think they're four dollars right now
I'm color pops website I do have a bit
of a bonus shade for that color as well
this is going steady from colour-pop
this is not quite as purple I'll hold
them up next to each other this one
definitely has a little bit more red to
it this is going steady this is one for
three but if you were wanting something
more this shade you could definitely use
this or if you think this will do just
as well you might not need this one but
this one's good just get that one
the next dupe I have is the color
masquerade from makeup geek I love this
color I love those warm Purple's
there's something about them this isn't
the most insanely pigmented color but I
still love it again I have it on today
on my lower lash line and also in my
crease so pretty highly suggest this
color from makeup geek and you may have
noticed that when I held this up I was
missing a shadow and that is because I
decided to look through my other singles
and I think that this one from Urban
Decay fits it perfectly this is one of
their moon dust shadows and it's
absolutely beautiful
it's what I'm wearing on my lips today
and it it is it's such a pretty shadow I
bought this right when it first came out
and it was like being insanely raved
about it is glittery if you want glitter
this is for you I highly suggest using a
glitter glue using a cream shadow using
fix+
as well as putting this over another
shadow essentially because it doesn't
have a ton of pigment necessarily itself
it really does have just this iridescent
and then a ton of like Bluegreen glitter
over a red base it's super pretty I do
really like it it is quite expensive but
if this was the shade that you were
looking for in the palette I think this
one is very very comparable and it's
gonna give you that really fun duochrome
like just whimsical awesome look and you
don't have to spend sixty five dollars
you can just get a shadow for twenty
just well it's still expensive but you
know what I'm saying we are onto the
last row of the palette the next shade
that I have I'm not sure how similar
this is I kind of just took my own
Liberty I think at this point this is a
really pretty light purple color this is
purple haze from look see beauty I used
a lot of the look see Beauty shadows and
this one
I just felt like they really gave off so
much of the same vibes and so much of
that same Sparkle and just difference I
don't know this one is really really
beautiful I just love them the look see
shadows are really really good you just
gotta you got to know how to work with
them I have a couple bonus shades for
that shadow as well this is the colored
a junior from makeup geek it's a very
beautiful foiled shade if you already
have this I don't think you need the
look c1 necessarily this one is a little
bit lighter and almost has a silver tone
to it or this one definitely still
shines that purple but it's nice and
cool and then my last bonus shade for
that shadow is the color foxy lady again
from luck see beauty this is a purple
but it flashes gold so interesting and
different I really think this would look
so cool with the masquerade color and
one for three and doing some type of
like monochromatic purple look
absolutely beautiful
I might do that soon because I'm really
diggin it moving on to the next dupe in
the palette this is the color flower
child from luck see beauty this is a
pink with a gold Sheen to it the green
is quite light but it's so pretty I
think this is such a beautiful shade I
think this would look great all over the
lid with just that Brown transition in
the crease just something super simple
you don't always have to do something
like crazy every single day guys but you
can still have fun and have something
different I do want to throw out a bonus
shade for that color this doesn't really
have a place I just thought this would
look really cool but it didn't quite do
anything exactly this is wildfire for a
makeup geek you cannot get this pressed
you would have to get this in a pigment
but it's so beautiful
it's a pink but it flashes gold oh it's
so stunning I love this this is also
very similar I think to the color in the
Carli bybel palette the deluxe one so if
you have that you have a very similar
color moving on to the next color in the
palette I believe that one is the pure
glitter I don't have any red glitter but
if you have a red glitter it's probably
very very similar or like a burgundy one
I decided to throw in whatever I wanted
and that was make it geeks flamethrower
it wouldn't be a let's do but if I
didn't throw flame thrower in this is
such a beautiful shade it got a lot of
hype when it first came out and then I
just died away I think it's nice to tie
in a little bit more orange with some of
these other warmer shades that are in
the palette my next new print palette is
pinky-promise from colour-pop this is a
very beautiful like purpley burgundy
like shade this is very similar to red
stone from the palette that we've
already talked about I'm going to pull
it out right now so you can see it this
one has more of that brown undertone at
the top that's pinky promise and then
this one is red stone so you can decide
if they're different enough for you or
not both of those shades are very
similar in the original palette as well
but I thought you could potentially do
something a little bit different with
both of them the last two shades are
both from Coastal Scents this first one
is the color pomegranate red I am NOT
saying that this is the best red by any
means so it's inexpensive I can tell you
that you definitely have to build this
color up to get red if not it might look
a little bit like a darker pink but it's
it's nice if you have sugar pill though
they have a really beautiful red if
you're looking for a nice one but you
can also look into your palettes if you
have like some Kat Von D ones serpentina
she also had it in that little like
two-faced one if you happen to get that
palette so just look for a matte red and
I feel like you'll be good on that shade
and then this last shade is actually not
from Coastal Scents I'm a liar this is
the color cannonball and it's just a
really beautiful Orange this one has a
little bit more of like a warmer yellow
to it than the other one I'm gonna show
you so pretty so creamy it is a bit
powdery but you definitely can work with
it it's so pigmented though like I feel
like if it's gonna be powdery it better
be pigmented so it's more like a lorac
formula think of that love that shade I
do have a bonus shadow though this one
is from Coastal Scents it's the color
dark mango again matte but this one is
definitely different it's like a
brighter orange if you're looking for
that if you're looking for something
that's a little bit less expensive dark
mango is really nice I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I hope it
inspired you to go through your
collection or if you were looking for
just a couple of shades I hope it helped
you find them again if you want to see
the demo it will be linked all of these
shadows will be linked everything's
always linked and if you want to stay
tuned for close-up swatches they will be
next other than that I will see you in
my next video bye guys
