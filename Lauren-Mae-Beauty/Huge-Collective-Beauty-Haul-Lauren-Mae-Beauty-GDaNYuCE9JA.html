thanks for tuning in today i am going to
address the pink elephant in the room I
did dye my hair it is like a lavender
pink color I did it last night it was
mine and Sam's one-year anniversary for
being married and we decorated our
Christmas tree because I'm a psychopath
and love Christmas so I was like please
and we're gonna make it a tradition he
doesn't know that yet but it's gonna be
a tradition and then I wanted to dye my
hair so I dyed it I really like it i
think i'm gonna dye it again I'd went
really really pastel and so you
definitely can see the blonde still
which I like that look I might just go a
little darker with a purple so awkward
when there's been outside anyway that is
everything for my hair we're going to
just move on this is going to be a huge
collective beauty haul I've bought quite
a few things recently I've have some
stuff here from Ulta something from
Sephora and then I did by quite a bit
from my work because I did quit my job
and I recently touched on that just so
briefly in a different video I'm not
going to get into in this video but I
did quit and I wanted to take advantage
of my discount I got thirty percent off
all my products at work so I was like
buying up the store on just different
things i knew i would need so let's get
into the different things i bought i'm
gonna try to go through quickly and then
of course let me know if you want any of
this stuff like in swatches or reviews
or just anything like that let's go i'm
going to be mentioning this first so i'm
gonna go through the stuff from my work
first this is the times i believe it I
say it Fraser Fir candle I actually
don't have it in the box anymore cuz
they've already burnt it this is what it
looks like out of the container me and
Sam burnt it last night while we lit
decorated the candle to agree the candle
me and Sam lid it last night while we
decorated the tree this is like my
favorite kind of balsam or balsam send
very like tree Christmas so good doesn't
have any cinnamon girl oh this is my
favorite one though like out of all
those types of sense this is the one I
have loved the most always so I splurged
on this candle it's like fifty dollars
which is crazy but
I just love it and I'm just excited and
glad that we burnt it last night and I
wanted to be part of my like sent memory
of the holidays and us living out here
in California for the first time and all
that so i did it i went for it I got a
few of the two phase sets for Christmas
at my work because I wanted them really
badly although I didn't need them and I
wasn't gonna buy them if I could only
get them out like Sephora and ulta cuz I
didn't want to pay full price but we got
these in literally my last day and I
thought its fate so I bought two
different sets I've already gotten into
him so I'm so sorry guys but this set
here this is the melted kisses and sweet
cheeks it's the one that has the three
little blushes and then the three
matching mini melted lipsticks with it
so I think that is such a cool idea they
come separately packaged so if you
wanted to if you wanted to feel better
about buying it you could like take two
for yourself and give one away or take
one and split it up between you and your
girlfriend's really really cool i will
show you the different color sets the
first set was the nude melted lipstick
and the color in the blush called love
hangover these blushes are quite tiny
and i think some people would be
disappointed with that personally i am
not i have about a million blushes no
seriously though like 70 I don't need a
full-size blush so I really just wanted
to try out the formula of these blushes
and they already do I like the melted
like lipstick formula so I was like this
is perfect and i love that their menus
like that is part of what drew me to the
sets is that they're minis because i
can't go through full-size stuff I have
so much product at this point that all I
want to do is try out different colors
try a different formulas and if i have
the moment full-size even just more
product with no wasted so it's nice to
have less product get a better deal on
that product and be able to have more
stuff anyway that's the color there i'll
do a little swatch that's it there are
really pretty like peachy color and then
i'm not going to do swatches of all
these lip products as there's a lot but
definitely let me know if you want me to
swatch every one of these melted
lipsticks i have but that's the nude
color the next one had peony which i
already put in like the products i don't
want to use because i already had a mini
of peony and then the blush color was
justify my love
he's a little bit more of like a true
pink it's a little bit more berry but
it's just like a true paint color and
then the last little set that came in
there was the blush in your love is king
and then the color fig which I was
really excited I've wanted fig for a
long time and I've wanted nude for a
long time so for me this set was
definitely worth it this one is more
berry although let's see in camera oh
yeah they look different so those are
the three blushes that you get I think
it's a great set I think it was 32 or 35
or 36 whoo that's not very good to know
the price and then I got a thirty
percent off so I thought that was
definitely worth it for the six products
and then I did get the other like melted
lip the melted lipstick like four pack
this one is called I think it's called
french kisses so this had two of the
original formula and two of the melted
metallic formula I've wanted to try the
metallic again i'm so glad they came in
many sizes because i'm not going to go
through the full size so this is melted
metallic McCarron this is melted berry
melted chihuahua which this is the one I
was the most excited about and then this
is melted metallic peony so it's not the
original it is like a metallic finish on
it so I'm really excited to have all of
those i know i do need these these were
totally just like for fun in this large
it's so funny because i just mentioned
in like my last video i don't need lip
products what the heck but i really love
the formula of these out of like lip
products that i have they are the ones
that i like reach for more so I mean I
only justify it but let's keep going I
also got this kula makeup setting spray
I really wanted this because it has the
SPF 30 in it and I thought it'd be a
great way to protect my skin from the
Sun but also you know set my makeup and
I also liked it for like even touching
up throughout the day you should be
reapplying your sunscreen every two
hours but it makes it impossible if you
put a face of makeup on and then how are
you supposed to like rub sunscreen on so
I thought this would be a great one to
like reapply sunscreen throughout the
day without doing like a powder with
sunscreen minute anyway I wanted to try
this out for a long time so I thought I
might as well get
d % off discount instead of that I also
got a Deborah Lippmann polish this one
is in the color do them are made I do
believe this is a like a limited edition
color that came out I don't know how
long ago it's not it's not permanent I'm
pretty sure anyway it's a beautiful like
lavender color I absolutely love it I've
wanted it at work for a really long time
and since I don't think you can get it
anywhere else I thought it might as well
might as well get it right I just really
really love it I have the mermaids dream
one and then there's like a pink one
that's like mermaid kisses which I
wanted but I was good and only got one
attend to hey that's pretty good right
another thing that I picked up is
another one of the Beauty Blender sets
this set is just such a great deal it's
forty dollars for this you get to beauty
blenders and you get the cleanser in the
full-size i believe and then I got my
discount on top of that I just couldn't
pass it up I only use the Beauty Blender
now for applying any type of like cream
or liquid products on my face and then I
use brushes to apply like powders and
dry products so I just love the Beauty
Blender and I just wanted to have extra
it really hurts to pay twenty dollars
for a bead wonder so I'm like set for
like a year now which is awesome I also
picked up the clear brow gel by
anastacio I am gonna be out of mind by
the end of the year so I thought this
would last me probably another year I'm
not going to get rid of it just because
it looks girls like if there's still
product and it's me using it only I'm
find it that so I thought I'd stock up
basically until next year so yeah
awesome I did get the hair dye that I
dyed my hair with at work so to get this
color that I'm wearing now I put these
two together this is the amplified
virgin snow and this is just a white
toner this isn't actually like a die so
it's just going to take out brassy color
I didn't realize that when I got it and
then this is the mystic Heather I put
these together and then added a ton of
conditioner to kind of get this look
this is a warmer purple that's why it
turns more pinky and then i bought the
pink because i wanted it to be a warmer
violet war
are like lavender type of color so I
thought if that didn't work I could
always add a dollop of the pink to kind
of give it that warmth and it worked out
without it so I just have these for
later I thought I would get the discount
on them these are like 17 appease these
are these are like 14 something was a 17
something so I definitely wanted the
thirty percent off if I was getting to
dye my hair I think the last thing from
my work that I bought for myself I did
buy two other things for Sam but this is
all I didn't buy this for myself I was
formal anyway this is something that i
bought from my mom i wanted to mention
it because it's just such a great deal
this is a bliss body butter set and it
is thirty-five dollars you get three
full-size products and we saw one body
butter on my work full price for 29 so
if you like these or if you were
thinking about ever trying these out the
holiday set is definitely the way to go
you're paying six dollars more for two
other full-size products you just can't
beat that you can also split this up and
put them in like stockings or anything
like that so you could get more gifts
out of it than just like one gift if you
wanted to anyway I think it's an amazing
set I did pick her up two of them
because we just couldn't pass up the
deal i think they ended up being 24 with
my discount that's an amazing view I'm
just gonna fly by the thing I got from
sephora i was talking to a girl at work
her name's Nicole and she loves makeup
like she's more obsessed with the makeup
and beauties and I am and she had
mentioned that noise had come out with a
blush palette and I was like oh I didn't
know and so then that day on lunch I
seriously one of my phone and bought
this which is psycho this is the NARS
steven klein palette so this i was
really excited to get because it has the
four blushes the Laguna bronzer but then
it has the contouring and highlighting
duo in Paloma in here which is something
I was already kind of looking at and
interested in but I just didn't want to
pay that much money for it so I'm really
happy I got this it was kind of on a
whim I love Narses blush palette I've
gotten them the last two years I do
think it's a good one if you don't have
very many blushes or bronzers or you
really have been wanting to try out NARS
is like face products and Colour
products for the face I think this is a
great value you get a lot of products in
here it's definitely not necessary for
someone
a lot of makeup though I just love it so
i'm really glad i got this and then with
that order i decided to pick up another
of these 500-point perks this is the
origins one I picked it up last time to
I just really like it it has the eye
cream in here which is like a great size
definitely not full size but I mean it's
going to take you forever to go through
i love the cleanser the checks and
balances cleanser from origins is like
my absolute favorite cleanser I just
love it and then it has an exfoliator
and like a night cream in here and the
night cream is the vitamins or night
amends I'm sorry high potency night
amends like face cream and I really
really liked it so I thought since it's
such a great size why not have this I
mean you get it for free for spending a
ton of money there but I just thought I
really like the products in here so I
thought I'd pick up another one of those
last is the stuff I got from multi got
four things from Ulta I couldn't resist
I couldn't resist a lot of these you
know I was gonna get I did gosh I'm so
sorry about the lighting I don't know
what's going on it's like so dark okay I
like let it up more so hopefully it
looks better but this is the vice for
palette I was wanting this like since
the moment I saw it so beautiful i have
used it already I do really like it I
think it's a really good like addition
to the vice palette that they've done
love it I ended up getting this becca
afterglow palette this one has five
products in it gotcha can opener it has
two of their blushes and then three of
the highlighters so has the blush and
flower child flower child wild honey
then this is the highlighter and topaz
this is rose gold and that is moonstone
so I just really liked this I've been
wanting to try out back this blushes for
a long time and since it came in this
palette I thought it was a good deal
because they're blushes are really
expensive and then I thought it's just a
nice travel pack I've not had topaz
before so to me it ended up working out
as a good deal so I got that and then I
couldn't resist the tart blushes either
I know that they have the palette out
and I do like the palette but i don't
need the palette
I needed these oh I didn't need these
either but this was like the four pack
of the blushes and the singles my gosh
of dropping everything I just there's
something about things that I gravitate
to I've bought them I think three years
now and I just love them so this is in
the color embellish that's it they're
really really pretty color I think all
the colors in here are very nice very
neutral very something I would wear this
one is in the color entertain this is in
the color ecstatic which I really really
like I love those peachy colors yes this
is an epic which is more like a
correlate peach love all of them I think
they're really great and the last item
for this hall is my lorac mega Pro to
you guys knew I was going to get this
and you have already seen at my end of
the year project pan I really like this
palette I think I like it more than the
original for whatever reason I just
gravitate to like every color in here I
love it I'm just in love so really glad
I got that I'm really glad it wasn't so
like limited limited edition like it was
the year before that was like crazy but
anyway that is everything I hope you
guys enjoy this video I'm so sorry the
Lighting's weird I'm working on it I
feel like my lighting was fine and then
I get back from Peru and I don't know
how to do it what's going on I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and yeah
let me know if you want to see any of
this and like more in depth in the
