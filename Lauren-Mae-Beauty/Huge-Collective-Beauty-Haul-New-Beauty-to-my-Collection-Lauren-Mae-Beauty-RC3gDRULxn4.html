Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing a haul
video so first off I want to say if
you're gonna know buy or if this is
gonna trigger you into buying anything
please don't watch this it's gonna be
kind of a lot of products and I try not
to haul too many things on my channel I
just like to be a little bit more
conscious of what I'm bringing into my
collection and don't want to buy like
everything out there because it's just
impossible there's too much stuff but
this one is kind of big I have some
really great stuff I'm excited to show
you guys and I think the last haul I did
on my channel was an elf haul right
before Christmas so it's been a little
big some of this is PR but I'm gonna put
that at the end in case you don't want
to see that and the rest at the
beginning that was everything that I've
purchased that I thought that I was
excited to try out I will say to my I'm
filming kind of a few videos today so I
don't know how I'm going to be uploading
them but you will see a lot of this look
and if you do like it I do have a demo
of it in a video so I'll leave that link
down below it's for the colour-pop
moonlight magic collection I have a
little demo on ilyich so that all being
said let's get into the products I
picked up I'm super excited to show you
some of the things a lot of these things
are her items that I talked about on my
current wishlist so I bought a lot of
those things I was thinking about them
for a while while I was on my no bi and
I decided to pull the trigger I think it
makes sense to start off with the color
pop moonlight magic stuff because this
is some of the stuff I'm the most
excited about so you guys know I love
color pop I think that they do really
great fun trendy affordable makeup and
I'm down for that so I did pick up all
of these supernova shadows I'm wearing
them on my eyes today I'm wearing the
color over again which is the pink kind
of purple gold green duochrome
and then I'm wearing a little bit of
Lucky Penny which is a it looks white
but it's like iridescent duochrome like
every color of the rainbow on top of
that they also came out with the shade
Prelude which is a pretty color I guess
I'll swatch them all for you that is pre
lewd I if you want more on this either
my video with the moonlight magic
collection will be out and I can link
that or will be coming this one's over
again again that's the one on my lids
this one's Lucky Penny it looks like
really green but it has like a pink
shift to it sometimes do it so pretty
from the valleys really beautiful it
almost has like a grey purple with a
pinky reflux reflect I think it's
reflect I don't think it's reflux and
then I feel like the one that's the
least amount of duochrome is now or
never it's like a purpley Mavi pink with
a gold kind of shift but it's the most
like opaque and metallic so these are
super beautiful
they're seven dollars a piece I don't
think everyone needs all of them I'm so
excited to have them I think they make
any look really pretty it looks really
done up but it's super effortless so I'm
excited to use these more you you can
bet that they're gonna be in a lot more
tutorials coming up and yeah if you were
looking into them I do suggest them I
think they're really nice with that
order I just couldn't help myself and I
did pick up the glosses I'm wearing this
one today this is the shade my forte and
it's a purple lavender color with a blue
reflex and it does shine a little bit
green as well really cool these do have
a bit of glitter in them and I do find
that you can feel that glitter on the
lip so if that's something you hate you
won't like these it's nothing too chunky
or crazy but it's definitely there this
one is the peach shade and it is
verbatim is the name of the color and
then the coolest one I think that would
be a great topper is finesse and it's
it's just like a clear iridescent
glittery lip gloss they're beautiful um
and I don't think a lot of brands are
necessarily doing this but not everyone
needs them again they're not like a
staple nude lipstick or lip gloss or
something for me or someone who likes a
lot of color I think you'll love them
but if you don't you probably can skip
out and be fine I believe the rest of
the stuff that I bought is all from
Sephora I had some gift cards and I was
excited to get some stuff off my
wishlist so let's get into it the first
thing that I picked up I did pick this
up guys I know I said maybe I won't
anyways convinced me in the comments of
my wishlist video so I was like you know
what you're right I'm gonna get it this
is the Becca jet-set glow primer and
corrector package set I kept it in the
box because I wanted to show you guys
the packaging but it's they're really
small products so it comes with two
primers
of them is the backlight priming filter
I have not tried that out and then the
other one is the first light priming
filter and this is something I did have
a deluxe sized sample of I couldn't find
it and guess what I freaking found it so
now I have this one and a little bit of
a smaller version of that but I did like
it a couple times I've tried it I
thought it was really nice and the thing
that kind of sent me over the edge to
pick up that set is the Becca under-eye
brightening corrector it's something
I've wanted to try but I can't I just
didn't want to splash out on the big
size and I loved that this was just a
mini I know this is gonna last a long
time and if I go all the way through
this and really enjoy it I can always
pick up the full size and if I don't
like it it's just something small and
you know not as much money so so far
I've been really enjoying this it's
super emollient everyone's saying it's
emollient it is it is like you touch it
and it like melts immediately into your
fingers I have found that I like it best
applied with my fingers I think the
warmth just kind of helps thin it out a
little bit and a brush can just apply it
a little bit too heavy so far it's nice
it's not like something that's amazing
yet but I'm still kind of working I just
have been noticing I'm a little bit
darker in my under eye then maybe normal
I don't know what that is about but um
so far I'm really happy I picked up this
set and I'm excited to try this products
out the next set that I decided to pick
up was the Beauty Blender and Too Faced
collaboration where you get a Beauty
Blender a micro mini you get a mini
sample of the hangover RX primer and the
hangover RX replenishing like spray you
will notice that there's a trend in this
haul that freaking primers and skincare
are what I'm into I'm just really into
like a glowy like really hydrated
healthy base before I even put
foundation on and so I can tell that a
lot of my products were purchased in the
hopes of creating that and trying
different products that hopefully will
suit my skin and not make me too oily
but not make me dry just there will be a
lot of that just so you know I have used
the mister a couple of times and it's
pretty nice but I will get back to you
with reviews on all of this stuff I do a
series on my channel called haul in
retrospect which is where I will come
back from a previous haul and let you
guys know about what I think about those
products if they're worth it if they're
not did I enjoy them do I wish I hadn't
bought them what not so that'll be
hopefully coming in like I'm
month or so I have one that I need to do
which will probably be in my next set of
videos I think next I'm going to talk
about all the things I picked up from
the ordinary again in my makeup wish
list I talked about how I wanted to pick
some of this stuff up this is the
glycolic acid toning solution I believe
this retails for like eight dollars and
change so it's an amazing price
I love affordable stuff like I've
realized like I just I enjoy getting
good things at a good price so I have
been using this a bit me and Sam have
been I do like it it does tingle a
little bit and I'm hoping that it works
so I definitely need to try this way
more before I can give any type of
review I feel like skincare literally
you have to use the entire thing up and
then you can maybe say like yeah it did
something or like no I did it I did pick
up two things in dropper form this is
the caffeine solution 5% plus EGCG this
is supposed to go underneath the eyes
but it's the same size as the face one I
don't know why they made it this big
when it's just for underneath the eyes
you use it day and night and it's
supposed to get rid of pigmentation as
well as kind of like do you puff with
that caffeine I've been using this quite
a bit I haven't really noticed anything
different if I'm being honest but I'm
going to keep using it and see you
haven't noticed anything negative the
one thing we don't like so far though
see that nasty thing around the rim yeah
that's like product build-up I clean
that like every couple of days but
because of the dropper it's just such a
messy application method so I'm sure
this has to do with keeping the price
down and having it all in these like
type of containers but honestly when it
comes to like messiness it's pretty
messy and the other skincare product I
got is the nice enameled I don't know
how to say it that's how I'm gonna say
it ten percent in zinc one percent
it's a high-strength vitamin and mineral
blemish formula not really sure what
it's supposed to do honestly I'm not
very like skincare savvy I'm not gonna
lie to you but you're supposed to put it
on morning and night I've been doing my
best to put this on like after I like
tone my face I'll put this on then I
even it will put on a bit more of a
serum and then a moisturizer so yeah
I've been using it all I guys now I'll
probably do a collective skincare review
on some of the skincare that I've been
trying out so you can probably see a
review in that once I try this
a little bit longer and I did pick one
other product up this is the ordinary
high adherence silicone primer and I
just wanted to try this out this is
under five dollars which is a great
price that's like better than some
things in the drugstore so I again
primers guys I have so many primers to
go through my goodness it's going to be
so much fun
but I definitely need to use some of
these guys up I only have a couple more
full-size items that I actually like
purchased and weren't free samples
these next items were a set from the
Sephora and house of lashes
collaboration these are the pencil
eyeliners and these were on sale so
that's kind of what inspired me to pick
them up I was eyeing them before they
went on sale but the $18 price tag
definitely sealed the deal for me these
are all metallic there's like a bronze
like light pink and a gold I did use
this gold in one of my more recent
tutorials the palette bingo with the Kat
Von D that's what I used it in they're
really really pretty I find that they
set really nicely I think they're good
for $18 I'm happy with this purchase
I think I'll definitely get the most use
out of these but this will be nice like
inner corner highlight I think more than
I think I'm just gonna have to try
harder to use this since it's such a
light color it's not really defining
anything it's more of a brightening
shade but these ones I'm excited about
especially this bronze so I'm happy with
that
I know one talked about this koma that
all the palettes the other set of liners
which I was tempted to get but I'm more
wanting to purchase gel liners that I am
like pen one so I let those ones go next
I did decide to pick up the Moroccan oil
lip balm this was actually in stock
which is what was like yeah I'm so
excited this has a mint tea scent to it
which is very interesting I think it
smells really nice I love the smell of
mint it's one of my favorite like sense
I love the taste of mint and like a
lemonade it's so good like a frozen mint
lemonade the best thing the most
refreshing thing so I mean I've tried
for a couple times I'm enjoying it I
think it's nice it's expensive it's a
seventeen dollar lip balm it's a lot of
money I bought this because I love
Moroccan oil and I really wanted to try
it so yeah I love lip balms too you guys
saw my product
really excited about like one of them's
left formula and the last full-sized
item that I bought from Sephora is the
bareMinerals well rested this is a
powder concealer that you can use
underneath the eyes to brighten I use
this on camera for the first time in my
last get ready with me and it definitely
is really pigmented and I feel like you
can get out of hand really easily which
a lot of you guys in the comments told
me that so I should have known but I
definitely used too much of it there so
I'm gonna play around with this a little
bit more I wish I was just slightly more
brightening and so I don't know I'm
gonna play around with it but if I don't
fall in love with this you guys need to
remind me to just return it and get
something else because this is so much
product and I don't want to have to like
feel like I need to use this up and it's
like about twenty dollars so I'd rather
get that money back put it toward maybe
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder or something else that maybe will
do the job I'm actually looking for but
I don't want to give up on it yet so I'm
still going to continue to try to use it
I thought I wouldn't mention this really
fast this is the NYX glitter primer I
did pick this up from a next-door nearby
me I really wanted to have something
that I could use for loose pigments and
loose glitters and just have a really
sticky base for products that just
needed I feel like it's really hard to
test out shadows if you don't have the
correct primer it can just change a lot
so I'm excited to have this in my
collection and actually be able to use
it and hopefully get some better use out
of shadows that maybe I was scared to
use or didn't want to have like glitter
all over my face by the end of the night
so the rest of the stuff in this basket
is all from Sephora but these are all
things I got with points or I used a
code for I made a couple different
orders and just hit like the twenty five
dollar minimum because I wanted to pick
up different samples and that's
something that I haven't done in a long
time I used to do that when I would buy
a lot but since I have free shipping and
I'm gonna be purchasing stuff I kind of
like have a running list and then once
the samples good enough I'm like okay
I'll purchase those items if I have a
gift card or whatever I'm doing so I'm
so excited because it's given me the
chance to try out a lot of products that
I was really interested in and excited
to try but I didn't want to spend the
money on and a lot of these are a big
enough sample to actually get an opinion
on - which is so nice so I'll try to
like get through these the first thing
here was a nice sample I don't know if
this
a point perk I think it made me was like
a 250 point perk but this is from glow
recipe and I was really excited to try
this because it has a small sample of
the watermelon glow sleeping mask I have
the full size of this on my love's list
for a while and so I was like oh my gosh
I get to try it out this probably has
one or two uses in it and it does smell
like watermelon just in case you were
wondering so I'm excited to try that out
and then it also came with the blueberry
bounce gentle cleanser so I'm gonna give
those a try something I was thinking
about because in my wish list video I
talked about how I wanted to maybe do a
subscription box again and I was asking
your opinions on glossy box cuz that's
the one I was thinking about because
it's only twenty $1.99 you get four to
five full-size products which i think is
really nice but then someone is saying
just get Sephora plate because then you
can get samples and you can actually
move through them and see if you like
the product and buy it if you do and
that's very true so I'm like kind of
torn because something that I love about
all these little samples is that I know
I'm gonna be able to go through them
before they go bad and I can try all
these things out have fun be
experimental give you guys potentially
reviews or just have an overall better
opinion on different things out on the
market without purchasing a ton of
things without having a bunch of
products sitting around and I love that
I think there's just something about
paying ten dollars for these little
samples that gets me like I love getting
them for free but I don't want to pay
ten dollars for them and if you give me
a little sample of perfume like a little
perfume vial for ten dollars I'm going
to go crazy on you that's I think the
hardest part for me but anyway I was
just thinking about that because I'm
talking about a bunch of little samples
here like I mentioned I did get a small
sample of the first like priming filter
so I will go through this one before I
open the other bigger one and the other
two many primers that I have here this
is the Laura Mercier foundation primer
ingredients I thought that would be
really nice to try out and then this is
a two-faced one in the primed and peachy
which is a cooling-- mattifying primer I
think this is the one I tried I haven't
tried the RX one so again just so
excited I just I want to try all these
primers but I don't want to pay for the
full size so it's nice to have a couple
little minis to try out I do have a
couple different foundation samples this
is the Dior skin forever under cover
foundation in
10 it's a little too dark for me but
we'll see I'm gonna see if I could try
it out but I would love to try out a
high-end foundation I love my makeup for
everyone and I also really love that
Lancome stick foundation I've been using
I'm almost done with it actually um but
I'm excited to try that and see if I can
make it work maybe save it for summer
when I'm a little bit darker this was
something that pushed me over the edge
to make it order this is the new Marc
Jacobs foundation this is in the shade
light why 2:10 I haven't even opened it
yet so I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna
keep it closed it looks a little dark
though the little dark for me so
hopefully I could get a tan and try this
out but I've been looking and I'm in
this foundation so I was really excited
to potentially get a sample and see if I
liked it and then this was one of just
the like samples you can pick at the end
like the 3 samples but it was actually
like a good one
it came with 6 different samples of the
vibrancy foundation from josie maran
and i do think one of these will match
me since there's so many different
options so I'm gonna try out my little
vial of it and then pass on the other
colors but I am excited to try that this
is definitely a glowy foundation I've
heard good and bad things so we'll see
if I like it I got in many of the
glitter drops I mentioned this in one of
my videos and I'm really excited to try
these out but these are glittery oh my
gosh yeah they're super glittery guys oh
wow mine is like the little droppers
like very movable in here anyway super
excited to have this mini definitely
would never need any more product than
this there's no way you're gonna go
through this like you would have to be
doing like makeup on a ton of people all
like glittered head to toe like
Westworld but glitter instead of like
bold body paint in this and then maybe
you could go through one but otherwise
this is like the perfect size this is
probably my favorite thing I got out of
everything and it was the free sample
this is the lineage lip sleeping mask
and I freakin am in love with this I
have been using this every night since I
got it for probably a good week and a
half now and I loved it so much I will
be buying the full size of this it's
probably gonna be in my favorites video
it smells like strawberries which is so
nice the feeling on the lips is just
it's hydrating without being heavy but
without being greasy it's just so nice
I feel like the hype is so real with
this product thoroughly enjoy it I think
it's really great and literally all the
other products are glam glow products I
had a code for like a sample pack of
like three different products so this is
the glam glow Valk asmik matte glow
moisturizer I'm really excited to try
that matte glow seems kind of
contradictory but also sounds perfect
for me because I'm oily but wanna glow
so like I hope it works out this is the
galactic cleanse melting jelly bomb
cleanser so that sounds interesting I
have the youth mud tingle mask
exfoliating treatment I have a many of
the super mud clearing treatment and
then this is the gravity mud firming
treatment so I am excited I know those
products are really expensive I also
recently got the like glow moisturizing
primer from them and that's been
interesting to try out so all those
little mini samples are so exciting and
I can't wait to try them out I just
broke my mirror but I don't think the
mayor actually broke could just broke
off the stand let's see if I have bad
luck for seven years
no we save y'all just broke off the base
okay
in with the old out with the new alright
alright so the next set of products are
all PR so this is all sent to me for
free
um that doesn't ever change my opinion
on things guys but in case you don't
want to watch this I understand so don't
watch this it was all free the first
thing here is from optilead this is from
dior and this is something i was really
excited to try out it's the highlighter
I'm wearing today and it's the nude air
Luminizer this is in the shade pink
something it's the pink one
it just says 0-2 on the back but I
believe Tara babies like loves this
highlighter and this is something I've
wanted for so long I've like thought
this was so pretty and thought it'd be
so beautiful and it is it's super duper
nice I kept the packaging because I
wanted to show you guys how nice it was
packaged it came like presented so
nicely has a little brush which honestly
what are you supposed to do with this
brush I don't feel like it goes with the
highlighter maybe you could buff some
like powder foundation into your skin
with this but yeah it's definitely not a
highlighter brush though I wish it was
more useful and then it comes with the
velvet
in the back so this was just really nice
packaging that when I got it I was like
this is really big for a highlighter but
the packaging is presented quite nice
I'm sure you guys will see this soon to
get ready with me or tutorial of some
kind I do really like it it's my first
time wearing it today but honestly it's
so beautiful to me it's a really nice
mix of like natural glow with a bit more
of like a metallic gel a glow like it's
an in-between which is really nice the
other products that I picked up from
octoly this is from Oprah and this is
the first like Oprah product I've really
tried I did have one of the many samples
at the kathleenlights and over a Havana
nights lipstick but this is like the
first other product besides that this is
the cool as a cucumber a moisturizing
primer and one that hydrate soothes and
smooths I have not tried this on the
skin but I am excited to it does have a
fresh scent of cucumber and obviously I
want to try this cuz it was a primer but
I also thought that this seemed very
similar to the idea of the Smashbox
primer Iser which is like a primer
moisturizer duo and so I wanted to just
see what it was like and I'm excited to
give that a go and try it out I'm gonna
have to have like a primer showdown and
maybe even like a glowy primer showdown
because here's another one
this is the Clarins SOS primer and this
is just a universal one that has like a
radiance to it they do have color
correcting primers in this line so they
have like a purple a yellow a green and
I think a orange why if I'm not mistaken
I just wanted the universal one because
I don't really need too much color
correcting on my face so far I do like
it it definitely gives you a bit of
radiance but it's nothing too slippery
so again I will give you guys more
feedback on that as I use it longer and
then the last thing from octoly this is
the number 7 early defense glow
activating serum since I've got this
I've seen quite a few YouTube
commercials on this actually one was
like Megan rinks is that her name
Megan someone in it and then one just
like about this and this is a serum that
is like kind of glowy and it definitely
does give you a bit of radiance but
honestly I was excited to try this out
because I did just finish another serum
from them I liked it at first but then I
felt like it was just kind of too
silicone II at the end and I thought I
would try this
to go see if it's like better and you
know I thought this would be nice to go
under primers honestly the first
ingredient on this is I think
dimethicone so this has a very silicone
II feel it's very similar feeling to the
other serum I don't know it's not like a
bad product I just yeah I need to test
it out more but I was a little
disappointed that it felt very similar
to the other one which wasn't my
favorite towards the end so we'll see
how I like it I think this could be
though a really nice like primer as well
the way it felt on the skin to have
makeup go on top of it you guys I've
been playing best fiends lately I know
and they keep sending me these
notifications my phone and I've been
loving it but I'm like I'm filming a
video right now quit anyway next I want
to talk about some products that purely
sent me and they sent me four different
items which i thought was really cool
they mostly do skincare stuff but I do
have a BB cream which I've really been
enjoying so these are sheet masks these
are the coconut and rice nourishing
sheet masks I have not tried these but I
have given one away to a friend when he
was in town he was like oh I want to do
a mask and we didn't get the chance to
so I was like oh take this one with you
it comes with six different masks in the
pack so I will be trying those out I
will say up front that I'm not someone
who really enjoys sheet masks like
they're a little bit claustrophobic on
my face but I will try those out at
least and try them I want to kind of
like see if maybe I'm over that but yeah
I haven't tried one in a while so we'll
see how I feel about those they also
sent over a cleanser this is the Blue
Lotus four in one cleansing milk I'm
excited to give this a try I have not
tried this product yet because I want to
finish up the cleanser I'm currently
using before I've open another product
but yeah again I will get back to you
probably in that skincare review video
and the last year products here from
them this is their lip balm it's the
daily lip nourisher with mango and shea
butter am I getting that inside ring
seriously why does that always happen to
me
I can't stand it anyway this is new
daily lip nourisher with mango and shea
butter I really hope that wasn't in all
the videos I filmed this is something
honestly I've only tried once or twice
but I just didn't like it the first time
I tried it obviously I was excited
it's a lip balm it didn't have a mango
smell it just wasn't very nice when it
came to like experience and fragrance
but then on top of that it just felt
really greasy and thin on the lips which
is not my style so I probably will
already be passing this on it just
doesn't seem like something I'm going to
get a lot of use out of especially
compared to the other lip balms I
currently have in my collection and then
the BB cream this is the thing I am most
excited about I've used this quite a bit
I've been using this probably almost
like a good three weeks now
I wear this basically every day I wear
makeup so it gives quite a bit of
coverage it's very dewy I don't find
that it gets overly greasy on my oily
skin though I'm someone though that
definitely I would way rather it be oily
throughout the day then super matte and
cakey so if you don't like something
that turns dewy you probably won't like
this if you have oily skin I believe
this only has five shades but it's like
an even shade range at least
it is just a tinted moisturizer though
so those generally don't have a huge
shade range let me know if you've tried
this out then what your thoughts are I'd
love to hear them it's really good
especially if you are darker skin like
how is the shade range for darker
complexions I would love to know if it's
actually good or not based on the
website looked pretty even but I would
love to know if you've tried it out and
what your thoughts were and the last two
products have to talk about our firm
derma e I was really excited to get this
package and I wasn't expecting it I did
apply for the derma e like creator thing
so if your creator and you want to try
and see if they want to send you stuff
you can go to their website and there's
a way you can apply it's really easy and
they didn't send me a notification or an
email of any sort that I saw but I just
got a package out the door that had a
products in it I thought that was really
cool specifically I'm not excited about
these products so I'm hoping next month
if they decide to keep sending it to me
that I will get like some skin care
stuff but these are mostly well this
isn't oil but this is for the hair this
is the three-in-one hair protection
serum strengthen smooth and shine so
it's really pretty packaging I might
give that to my mom cuz she's a
hairdresser and I think she might like
to try that out and see how it worked
and then the other product that they
sent over is the derma e organic argan
oil blend for skin hair and nails and
this has Cucuy and jojoba oils in it so
this is really
nice and like a little you know oil
dropper I'm not the biggest fan of oils
I'm using a serum right now that's an
oil and it is nice for really dry night
so I might keep that in my stop just to
have an oil I might switch it out with
the anasazi one in my kit and have that
in my kit and start easing up the
anasazi one I don't know we'll see pen
those are all the items so I hope you
guys enjoyed this haul I just wanted to
show you guys some of the new beauty
items coming into my collection let me
know if you've tried any of these things
if you like them if you don't I would
love to know your opinions and other
than that that is everything thank you
so so much for watching guys and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
