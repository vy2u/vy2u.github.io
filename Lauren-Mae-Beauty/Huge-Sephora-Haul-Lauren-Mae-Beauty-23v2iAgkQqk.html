is going to be a huge Sephora haul now
this is a collective haul so it's two
different orders that I've made and I
don't know I know I do a lot of project
pans on my channel and I'm totally about
that but I also love makeup when I love
buying stuff so this is a lot of stuff
it is a lot of stuff so it's gonna kind
of hold me over hopefully until like
holiday is what I'm thinking at least in
my head that's the goal hold me over
until I you know pick up some things
that i want for holiday but these are
some things that i picked up recently I
hope this itches any urges you had to
buy maybe you don't have to and I hope
that it doesn't make you go out and buy
but these are some things that I picked
up and I feel really happy with
basically everything that I picked up
which is really exciting there really
weren't any duds so let's get into it I
picked up this quad for makeup forever
this is four of their artists eye
shadows and it's a really pretty quad
it's a little more cool toned than I'm
used to but I really did want to just
try out this formula because everyone
has had so many great things about it
and I was like I want to try it so let
me swatch them for you that is some
swatch there it is an awesome formula do
not get me wrong they are just really
heavy eye shadows like when you feel
them they feel very heavy I don't know
not that I don't like them I'm wearing
this lighter shade like on my lid today
and I do like them I just I don't know
I'm still playing around with them I am
using a lot of like shadows on my
project pan so I haven't played with
these a ton but I'm gonna play with them
some more maybe do a review if you guys
want that or a look or something I
thought this is a good value i think i
was like 40 something dollars and I
thought it was good value though to get
all four of them and they seemed like
pretty colors to get like the eye shadow
step by the way I also got the tart
showstopper palette and I'm not gonna
lie the collector me wanted this
partially because it's a circle and I
have two other ones and so that I can
like have a third one which is so crazy
but also I really love the tart rain
forest after dark palette so I thought I
would get this one and see how it
compares I am again
colors on this are kind of cool like ma
vie but I feel like they're also ones
you can kind of warm up the crease and
really like pop the I make my eye look
really blue I really like that Corley
shade in the middle and what I was
really happy about is this highlighter
is definitely different than the
highlighter in the rain forest after
dark palette so I did enjoy that I think
these colors are all really nice and I'm
excited to play around with it I
definitely don't think that it is like a
dud or something and we're like I don't
regret getting it just because it's a
circle i think the shadow quality is
really nice tart has really stepped up
their game with their shadows so yeah
i'm really into it i think the packaging
is really nice too nice and sleek I
really like how it has so many products
and it when I go to Peru with my mom I'm
probably going to bring this or my rain
forest after dark and like be done in
two of my orders I picked up one each of
these blushes so in total i have two of
the clinique or two more of the clinic
cheek pop blushes this one here is in
cola pop it's really pretty amber f was
talking about this right when it came
out and I did want it then but since
they're permanent I didn't order and I'm
really happy to have this for fall and
just kind of play with it it's
definitely a unique shade and I'm
excited to just play with that and see
how I can make that look and then this
one is nude pop something way neutral I
love blushes like this that is it right
underneath Cola I'm really excited to
use this once I kind of hit my pan on my
other blush so I've used it a couple
times I'm not gonna lie but I don't want
to really bust it out too much until I
kind of have that joy of finishing that
other one up in my project so I'm
holding on to the joy of those until a
little bit later but I'm excited to try
them out I got you like foundation you
type of products so I picked up a powder
I'm not really a foundation person I
don't like to pick up foundation stuff
because it's boring to me but I really i
have been working through a lot of
foundations this year and I really do I
did want something that just is gonna
work well on my skin and that I don't
have to like hope it looks good or you
know compromise i guess so i just kind
of want to start testing out different
powders and stuff so this is the sephora
brand powder this is the Micro smooth
powder and light it is the lightest
shade that they carry now this is a
baked product and it definitely has like
a skin like finish but that also makes
me get oily throughout the day I've
noticed so I'm still testing this out to
see with what primary what foundation I
can best make this work when you put it
on the skin right away it looks really
nice just personally so far the couple
times i have tested it it just didn't
look good throughout the day but i'm
really going to use it up and not going
to return it i wanted to work because
it's nice to not look super powdery and
it'd be a good one to like on days where
maybe i'm not doing much which I'm
always doing something so I don't know
what dream I'm living in for that one
but um sometime I'm gonna make it work
and I'm just gonna find the right
foundation and primer to make this
product work because it's not that the
products addict shits with my skin type
and then I decided to just go for it i
was just in a mood man when I was
ordering so this is the makeup forever
Ultra HD that came out with ultra one I
got the color 117 which is also on the
website it says marble and meds make up
eight here on YouTube said that she was
marble and I was like well I'm gonna
just go with what she said I didn't even
look at swatches or anything I'm telling
you I'm not usually a foundation person
so I just went for it the shame matches
me really well it has like a yellow
undertone but I guess I don't know what
I'm what impression I was under with
this I just thought it had more coverage
I know it's an HD foundation so it's
supposed to look undetectable on camera
and everything but especially for the
state of my skin right now I have a lot
of scarring from the acne I've been
going through and then I still have a
couple breakouts it's definitely
clearing up and I don't know what it was
its hormonal probably stress related
around my chin area but I can't wear
this now it I mean when my skin was good
and how it used to be I could wear this
and I think it'd be really nice just
give me that little bit of coverage and
you really can't see it on the skin
which is insane when you put it on to
see that but for right now it's not a
good one for me so i'm gonna i'm not
going to return it i'm going to
get work because it's not like it's a
bad product it's just I want to try it
like in winter and see what it's going
to work like and also when my skin is
more healed I just want to play around
with it and see if I can get it to work
but I just feel like I have to lose so
much of it and then that kind of defeats
the purpose of having it be like HD and
undetectable because then you can see it
so anyway I did end up getting that so
hopefully I can get it to work or
hopefully my acne just players up and I
can use it right that's really the goal
I picked up to the liquid lipsticks from
kat von d this one is in the color
damned and this one is in the color I
think it's Requiem or reclaim I don't
know I'll swatch them for you so you can
see what they look like I did have one
other kat von d of liquid lipstick once
before and it just didn't work out for
me I could not get it to go on evenly
and so I returned it but I decided just
to go forward and get these two this one
I haven't had any problems with but
damned I have learned this one since I
got it and honestly it's just hard to
later I have to layer it so many times
which this is a liquid lipstick you can
layer and it doesn't like freak out on
you but I don't know I'm gonna keep it
because it's a really pretty color and
it did get it to work but it's
definitely tricky I don't know those are
them over here ah so pretty um but yeah
these are just definitely the damned 1
i'm definitely i have to kind of like
work with which it kind of just
surprises me because so many people rave
about this formula and I don't know is
it good I don't know what do you guys
think about them I love liquid matte
like lipsticks because they just stay on
all day and I'm not a touch up girl so I
don't have to worry about them but I
don't know a little disappointed but not
just point enough to return home and
make it work because for fall you know
i'll be rocking i picked up two
different eyeshadows the first one here
is from urban decay this is in the color
tonic and i hope you can see it in the
view i hope you guys can see that but it
is like a duochrome a type of color I
honestly got this because I want to use
it in a school project so that's it
they're so pretty
I've been like obsessed with this kind
of color lately so really glad I picked
it up definitely worth the money to me
because I love it and then the other eye
shadow that I got is one of these liquid
coconut water eyeshadows in playa del
pink from josie maran and i really love
my Rio de rose gold one so i thought i
would pick up oh let me shake it up a
little bit more because it's not
watching right so freaky there's people
outside and they can like watch me film
and its really weirding me out like I
have my light set up and I had probably
you guys can hear them talking think
about hear me talking that's it they're
really reflective totally my type of
color this was just like a matte you
know nice medium tone brown in the
crease and you're good to go I just
think it's so pretty and I really like
the formula of these they're super high
shine you can blend them out I just love
them so I wanted to pick this up one up
and there's this turquoise one out I
believe it's limited edition I'm so
tempted to get but I just know I won't
wear turquoise but I swatch that thing
in store please girl so pretty I need it
but I'm going to try to resist Sam will
kill me if I by name Omega and then
basically last but not least I have a
bunch of highlighters I went a little
crazy with the highlighters I just don't
know what happened well I know one thing
that happened jaclyn hill came out with
her highlighter so i had to get it this
is champagne pop so pretty this one is
really sparkly i'm not saying it has
glitter but it definitely I feel like
has more Sparkle than the other ones
maybe I'm crazy but if one of you guys
has it let me know if you think that's
true really pretty color so glad I have
it absolutely beautiful it is limited
edition so I do suggest you get it
although they've had it in stopped for a
while so just get it if you want it but
it's beautiful so don't have worries of
it being bad because it's great when I
ordered that with my first purchase it
came with one of the codes you could put
in was a Beca one and you get this for
free it's a mini of the opal highlighter
I don't have this one so I was like this
is awesome and so you know I'm never
going to go through probably even this
much highlighter so
God to have it and I didn't have to pay
any extra money for it so this is opal
and now I have opal moonstone champagne
pop and I have the rose gold one that
was like limited edition a couple
Christmases ago so yeah I'm I don't know
getting crazy with highlighters then I
got two to four brand highlighters these
ones are in this is light beam it's like
more pink toned and then this one is
Stardust and it's kind of like a white
gold type of color I've been wanting
these for a while I saw coffee break
with Danny and Samantha Riley they like
both picked him up and like a haul video
a while ago like a while ago and once I
saw them I really wanted them they were
only they were only fourteen dollars
which is still expensive but compared to
like Becca or other highlighters I was
just wanting to try them out so i got
them they're really good i do like them
they are like not again literally not
glittery but sparkly so they're
definitely like boom baby and your face
great for I mean all the time I'm kind
of into that all the time but i really
like these I'm glad that I finally bit
the bullet and picked it up and then
this one just snuck into my car it just
said hey I'm gonna come with you and I
didn't say no I just saw this on the
website was not planning to get it and I
don't know what it is it's like powder
mesmerized me and made me get it it's
just the most beautiful powder I've ever
seen and I don't really have anything
Laura Mercier if you can see like in
between these that shine is coming from
this powder so beautiful I like
absolutely love this this is limited
edition as well so if you want it
definitely get it oh I mean I just can't
that's all I have to say it's beautiful
yes yes yes yes that's really everything
i also got with my second order this
deluxe i sample of the smashbox camera
ready BB cream and light so i'll
probably be using that up soon just to
get it out of my collection and then
another little weird packet simple this
is the glam glow little daily
exfoliating cleanser um yeah i'll try
that out i had a couple other samples
but i don't want to bore you guys so
that's my like
massive haul I seriously can't buy stuff
for a really long time because it's
crazy but I hope you enjoyed it and I
know that I'm insane so ah I have to
just savor these makeup items so that i
don't buy anything else for quite a
while I will see you in the next video
guys have a wonderful day bye bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
