back to my channel this video is guess a
little bit different but it's kind of a
story it's kind of just my thoughts and
wearing that with my cluttering and my
collection and all of these things and
just my mindset so I was wanting to get
the Gwen Stefani palette I thought it
was so pretty
it was neutral so beautiful all these
things and you know there's lots of hype
lots of people had it and we're showing
it on YouTube and stuff so so excited I
was like okay I haven't bought or wanted
anything for a while which a while to me
is like a month so I'm like I'll I want
to get that palette and so I told him
like I'm gonna get that palette like
that's it I don't want anything else
really right now so I'm just gonna get
that one palette and I got closer and
closer to the release date and then I
saw a one more swatch video and I don't
know if the lighting was different or
whatever but I was like these are just
all neutrals like there's nothing
special about this palette I'm not
knocking anyone who got it I mean you
know I would I would have gotten it I
just I don't know what it was in that
moment I was like I'm gonna look at my
collection so I started going through my
collection and I decided to tally up all
the eyeshadows that I own so not just
how many large palette to have are small
pellets I have or singles that I have
but how many i shadow powder eyeshadow
pans that I have so all the different
colors all of that like every single
eyeshadow I own and I came up with this
every tally there is a eyeshadow and I
counted all of them up and I have a
thousand and 27 eyeshadow shades and
that's just crazy that's a lot of
eyeshadow that's a lot of colors that's
like at this point really how many
colors are that much different from
something that I have so this kind of
put in perspective for me to be like
okay I don't need that palette yes it's
beautiful yes the neutrals are nice it's
probably super silky the quality's great
the packaging is beautiful it's limited
edition but really how many of those
colors could I really do with what I
already have in my collection and how
many of the palettes that I've bought in
the past did I feel the same way about
and then they sit in my drawer and I
don't use them at all
that just got me thinking okay what now
I have a thousand eyeshadows so you guys
already know I wanted to do a pan that
palette this next coming up year so in
2016 I posted that video where I wanted
to kind of hear from you guys what you
thought the best palette would be again
thank you so very much to everyone who
commented I truly appreciate all your
input and you know there were some clear
winners the anasazi beverly hills lavish
palette the smashbox palettes and
narcissus palette those are all popular
so is Kat Von D one so all four of those
are really popular kind of where I was
thinking too so I was thinking okay I
want a pan a palette that's awesome that
would get something out of my collection
then I was thinking I'm gonna be
neglecting so much just try knees up one
palette I I was like okay still trying
to think and I've decluttered you guys
have seen me to color I've decluttered
so much in my collection and there comes
a point where it's like okay am I just
getting rid of stuff to like minimize
what I have instead of actually using
what I have so I feel like at this point
of my collection there's probably still
things I can get rid of and as I use
stuff up of course if I decide that you
know they're not working for me or if I
don't like them I can still declutter
them but I really just want to use what
I have okay like I've gotten rid of the
stuff that just doesn't quite cut it but
all these things I've kind of kept for
at least some reason why not use them
actually see progress in these items
instead of just throwing away I'm
getting rid of all this money I've spent
and product that I bought so I've
decided that this year one of my big
goals is going to be to try to hit pan
on as many eyeshadows as possible so I'm
going to do the pan that palette this
isn't like an official like video of
what I'm deciding but I I just wanted to
kind of talk to you guys and tell you
guys about how I feel I'm going to try
to hit pan on as many eyeshadows as
possible and I'm going to start with the
palettes that I've picked for that video
so I am probably going to start with one
of those four that I art just mentioned
and just start panning them and not
painting them where they're completely
gone just where I hit pan on them I feel
like when I see pan in a product it
makes me feel like okay I've used this
product this product has gotten love for
me I have used it and a lot of the times
I can almost feel like okay putting it
in my collection and satisfied like even
if that product was gone or broken or
like whatever out of my collection I
gave it away or something I felt like I
used it I actually used that product to
just buy it for no reason so that's just
kind of what I want to do with my
collection I just want to visibly see
progress in and use in my products
because right now all of them look brand
new and that is crazy when I count that
I have a thousand eyeshadows so as I was
doing this too just to bring it up I had
a thousand eyeshadows and these are the
eyeshadows that I hit pan on six I've
hit pan on six out of my a thousand and
twenty seven eyeshadows and honestly
half of those probably came from panning
stuff this year so that is just another
reason that it's like holy cow like I
really didn't need another palette with
twelve eyeshadows in it or however many
have had twenty eyeshadows in it yeah
it's this is just a different video I
mean there's really no point other than
letting you guys know that that's
something I'm gonna want to do this year
I know that's gonna be a little bit
different but many of you guys were
mentioning in the comments like why
don't you do four different palettes and
pan them for three months each or why
don't you switch off or you know keep
one palette and then switch out with and
pair it with another palette for the
rest of the year so I'm kind of like
morphing that with like this and all
these things I've been thinking and
again I'm just going to try to hit pan
on as many things as I can so once I hit
pan that's like again kind of like the
size of my brush I don't want it to be
like a pin needle or something I want it
to be like a sizable amount of pan but
once I do that I'm gonna kind of just
move on try other things in my
collection instead of just like focusing
so hard to get one thing done and then
everything else is untouched I'd rather
have like 20 things that I used all year
and whatever then finish up five
eyeshadows if that makes sense hopefully
it does let me know you guys think about
this down in the comments but I'm really
excited to just kind of actually use my
collection instead of focusing on just
getting rid of stuff or focusing on only
a hundred percent using up things kind
of just getting that use and seeing that
visible progress on more and multiple
items instead of completely finishing up
a couple I hope you guys are all doing
well and
I will see you guys in my next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
