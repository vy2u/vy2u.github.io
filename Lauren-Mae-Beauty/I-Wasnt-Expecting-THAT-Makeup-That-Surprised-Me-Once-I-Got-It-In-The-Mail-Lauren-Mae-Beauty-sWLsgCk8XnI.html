Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk about beauty
items that I had an idea about or for
some reason thought a certain way about
it whether it was reviews or just seeing
it online whatever it was and once I
bought it and actually had it in my
hands and played with it it just
surprised me I wasn't expecting that
so yeah I want to get into it this is
100% inspired by the new butter bronzer
collection thing that came out with the
body butter um because these are the
sizes of the products I was most excited
for mmm so this is the body butter that
you get in that $29 kit now granted you
do get a highlighter a blush and a
butter bronzer all in separate packaging
so I mean the price isn't that bad but
like the reason I bought it was for the
newer products like the body butter and
the spray and these are so freakin tiny
I did not realize these we're gonna be
so tiny this is like maybe for
applications guys this literally says
body butter on the outside of it but
like honey you can't put this on your
whole body more than like three times so
I'm a little bit sad about but this
smell of this is really nice I haven't
used it yet because my goodness I'm
gonna have to savor this crap it smells
really good it does smell to me
basically like the bronzer and I do
think it's a very similar scent to the
boom-boom cream from Sol de Janeiro it's
not exactly the same I feel like this
one's a little bit more tropical and
coconutty but they both have the like
Koopa sua or whatever it is I'll put the
name of it up on the screen here but the
same like really main ingredient in the
sol de janeiro one is also a part of
this so i'm not surprised that they have
a very similar scent so anyway what
surprised me and what I wasn't expecting
basically was the size on these two the
next one here is the butter paradise and
this is the scent that came out recently
this is what I was like the most excited
for and I knew it was half an ounce and
this is half an ounce but my goodness
this is so freakin tiny I'm gonna travel
with this to Italy so I guess that's
good and it does smell really really
nice but I'm just like oh it's so time
I wasn't expecting that I just wonder if
I saw it in person how it would feel I
probably would still buy it but I would
buy it knowing what I know now whereas
like when it came in the mail I was like
yeah yeah yeah what wait what I'm more
than anything disappointed I'm more than
I'm disappointed me like I think the
parts are still good I'm not gonna
return them but my goodness are they
tiny moving on to other items in my
collection though cuz I could go on
about that all day the next item I want
to talk about is the Natasha de Nona
Leela palette this is something that I
was so excited for I had not purchased
any other Natasha Danone a shadows I had
heard everyone rave about them say
they're like the best shadows ever
they've never touched anything as
pigmented and creamy and just you know
as good as Natasha to notice so when
this palette came out and I saw Natasha
to known as looks on her Instagram I
just was like sold I was like this is
gonna be so pretty I'm sure you guys
have seen the inside but this is what it
looks like it's beautiful I really do
like the color story of this so I was
really excited
I believe the reviews like I knew it was
expensive but I knew it was gonna be
amazing
and so when I got it and I played with
it which I do have a review I'll leave
that link down below it just isn't what
I expected
compared to all the reviews and to
everything that everyone said I just I
thought that these were gonna change my
life and not even that I honestly just
thought these are gonna be better like I
really truly did don't get me wrong I
think these are really pretty but I
definitely do not think they are worth
the money you're getting a ton of
product in here I'll give you that but
like that's not something that I look
for in a palette that gives it value
because you tell me the last time you
went through a full shadow please yeah I
know never know it's just very rare
right so I don't care about getting like
a ton of product because it doesn't
do anything for me it just sits around
and gets wasted and goes bad eventually
so I just really wanted this to be so
much better and I thought it was gonna
be so much better based on the reviews
and this palette just didn't work out
for me so it was definitely not
something that I expected once I
actually got my hands in it got my
brushes in it and put it on
eyeballs not all of these are like
disappointing some of these things I had
ideas about that I thought we're gonna
be maybe bad and they weren't and that's
how this next item was this is the Too
Faced primed and PG cooling matte skin
perfecting primer I think that I have
had really bad experiences with
mattifying primers specifically I'm
thinking about the Becca ever matte
which I just hated I hate the way that
feels on the skin you put it on and it
dries down pretty fast and feels tight
on the skin once it's dry it just well
it just does not feel good I don't feel
like product goes over it very well and
then more than anything that I hate is
that throughout the day it just feels
like glue on your face like when it
mixes with my oils I just feel like I
can scrape off a layer of foundation it
just feels like it we gooey sticky nasty
anyway so I think that I have a little
PTSD from that and so I got this as part
of a peachy set it came with the
full-size powder a full-size of the Too
Faced better than sex mascara and it
also came with a travel size of the
matte peach spray and so that's the
reason I got this I wouldn't have bought
this on its own but I've been using this
in a smaller size that I got as a sample
and I really do enjoy it I think that it
is a really nice mattifying primer that
does its job but doesn't like strip the
skin or make it feel like - too matte or
like just like you're gonna crack or
something I don't know how to explain it
I feel like this still gives some amount
of moisture which is so nice so this is
definitely something I wasn't expecting
I do make a lot of videos talking about
makeup items and just basing my opinions
off of other people's reviews or things
that I've seen online or my own makeup
preferences and so sometimes I'm right
and sometimes I'm wrong and this was a
time where I wouldn't have thought this
would work for me I don't think it would
be that great but it is and I do really
enjoy this product so it definitely
surprised me back to kind of a negative
thing
this is the number-7 airbrush away
tinted skin Perfector I did not pay for
this I got this off of octa Lee but
actually is a PR website where you get
to pick the item so it's not just random
PR being sent to you I pick like hey
that's interesting to me because of this
this and this so I'm gonna see if
send it to me and they sent this to me
cuz I really do like number seven stuff
I thought this is gonna be like a tinted
moisturizer or like a BB cream something
like that I do usually like a very nice
like medium coverage or something like
that so I was like maybe this will be
really great but this is like almost
like a primer so I bought it in two
shades light there aren't that many
shades but I thought because it was like
low coverage that it wouldn't matter
this is what the light looks like which
is so dark this is so freakin tart the
texture of this is so thick and silicone
E and mu C it really does remind me of
like a smoothing or pore filling primer
and so if it was marketed in that way I
think that would almost be fine but it's
not it supposed to be like a skin tint I
just don't I don't like this I didn't
expect this I thought it was gonna be
like moisturizer and glowy and this is
like just not anything I would have
expected to come out of the tube when I
got this in the mail it's just not
something I like the only way I can see
myself using this is to like fill in
pores around my nose and this would last
me forever the next item that I wasn't
expecting once I got in the mail is the
Smashbox cover shot eyes shadow palette
and the reason is again because of the
size I knew this was a small palette
when these first came out I was excited
and so I got the ablaze one because it
is the more warm toned one it's like the
popular colors out of everything
these retail a plea for like 25 or 27
dollars I used a coupon and so it's like
I'm so excited to get this in the mail
and I was just so surprised and so just
like what and how tiny this palette was
I've since gotten used to it and I feel
like they've done a great job of packing
so many colors in such a small palette
like they really did try to add so many
different colors instead of just making
this like the size of a quad or
something but I will say when I first
opened this up I was like what this is
tiny yeah which makes it great for
travel but it definitely was way smaller
than I thought it was going to be for
the $25 I have two more items to talk
about and the next one is something that
I also got off the octoly website so I
did not pay for these but these are from
Lancome and they are the absolute
powders I have the shade absolute golden
as well as absolute pêche and when I saw
these on the website I thought they
would be a really nice like luminous
powder that would make people with dry
skin not look so
you know just like dry and just
accentuate anything bad instead it would
be a way to set their foundation while
still having some glow and not taking
out all the radiance from their skin and
oh yeah baby this powder is blowy I use
this in to get ready with me and
honestly guys this is like a loose
subtle highlighter for me this is way
too shimmery to set the face it just it
just is too much especially if you're
gonna pack it on I think if you use a
very very light hand it could add this
tiny bit of radiance or maybe like
cutting it with another powder like half
and half but on its own for me you can
definitely use this as a subtle
highlighter this reminds me almost of
the laura geller baked french vanilla
highlighter but in loose form like
that's how it looks but it also has a
bit of like not glitter but definite
like sparkle to it so I just I was
expecting these to be just like these
beautiful powders I was looking up
reviews online before I even submitted
my request to review it and these are
just they're too glittery for me
especially to with like the type of work
I do because I did want to put these in
my kit and I just don't think that these
would translate super well on camera
especially for super close-ups I just
think it would look very very shimmery
and not at all the look that I could
actually do with so yeah I was kind of
disappointed in these although I do know
that there are a ton of people that love
them I know that Jacqueline Hill really
enjoys this powder and she packs it on
and she has dry skin so it might work
for you but it's definitely something
that once I got it in my hands it was
not what I was expecting I was not
thinking that it was gonna be that glowy
and the last item I wanted to mention
aren't the bare minerals Gen nude liquid
lipsticks these are something I had
wanted to try for a really long time I
had heard so many reviews about how
these were just so different than all
the other liquid lipsticks they were
more comfortable they're really great
and all this stuff and so I got them in
a mini kit during the holidays I even
got it on sale which is awesome it came
with three lip glosses which I love the
lip glosses and it's not that I don't
like these I just had this idea of them
being not a liquid lipstick but I mean
they're still liquid lipstick you know
like I just don't like liquid lipsticks
these are a more moosie formula and I
think that they're nice
I just they're not what I was expecting
once I actually started wearing them and
having them in my collection it's
definitely something that I potentially
could like do without so yeah I just are
they more comfortable than some sure I
just kind of thought these were gonna be
a liquid lipstick Savior and they're
just not like I just don't reach for
them still I I don't know I just I had
these ideas and I just wasn't expecting
my usage of them to be like how it is
which is basically non-existent because
I had heard so many good reviews and I
like you know I had really thought out
this purchase and yeah I just wasn't
expecting that that one was a little bit
more like just on my usage of the
product instead of really commenting too
much on the product itself but yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed the video when I
got that Physicians Formula stuff in the
mail I was just like what the heck and
then I was like I'm gonna make a video
about items that I just were totally
different once I got them in the mail or
once I actually started using them my
ideas about them initially we're totally
different so I hope you enjoyed thank
you guys so so much for watching and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
