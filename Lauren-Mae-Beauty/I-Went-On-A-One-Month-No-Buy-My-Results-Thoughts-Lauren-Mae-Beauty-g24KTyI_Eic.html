Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to give you guys an
update on my nail by I don't believe
that I made a video like specifically
announcing I was going on a no-buy I
think it was just in like a get ready
with me I'm pretty sure but anyway I
wanted to update you guys let you know
how I know bye went my feelings on it I
haven't done I don't think like a strict
no bye like I did for this month and so
yeah I wanted to give you guys some
thoughts update you guys on what I ended
up bringing into my collection because I
will say it wasn't a hundred percent
successful I think it was very
successful overall but I did buy a
couple things so I'm gonna show you guys
that stuff and just kind of talk with
you about my thoughts and I don't want
to say that another freaking time so
let's just get into it
so first off my no bi was from January
1st through January 31st so it just
ended and this one was gonna be kind of
tough because it was during my birthday
month which I feel like a lot of times
we buy a lot of stuff during our worth a
month because a lot birthing we treat
ourselves so that was gonna be kind of
hard it was also after the sales of
Sephora and everything once Christmas
stuff and holiday stuff went on sale so
that was kind of a little bit difficult
but I wanted to still do it it was
something I wanted to do for the new
year and was really excited about so I
didn't care about those things I wanted
to still do it another thing that I
wanted to do was to not get any PR
either so I personally use octoly as a
PR site so I can apply for things and
they send them to me I can tell you guys
about them honestly good or bad I can
put them in videos how I want to
essentially I send the products out for
free but I was like I don't want to do
that either and I wasn't a hundred
percent good about that but we'll get
into it so I want to show you guys the
things that I did end up picking up or
that did come into my life and the
reasons why I guess I wanted them and
why they broke my know bye and just
thoughts on that
and then we'll get into my overall
thoughts after that so when it comes to
octoly up who's doing such a good job
I've been doing a great job of not even
submitting reviews or anything like that
I just wanted it to kind of be a month
where I could test out products that I
had already in my collection but two
things on the site just got me and I
really wanted to try them out
and one of them you're gonna be like
girl you ridiculous but the first one
was a product from Becca this is the
Becca soft light blurring powder in pink
haze and you guys know that I've been
into loose translucent setting powders
and I thought this might be something to
give a try and I wanted to just try it
out and see how it was I'm also running
out of the translucent powder I was
using I just used it today I can't give
you guys a review but that's the reason
that it really got me would it still
have probably been there yeah but I just
that's what got me that's why I did it
that's why I picked it up and then the
only other thing that I picked up from
Hockley is the whole month were these
flosses okay seriously these went on the
website and I was like oh my gosh those
cloths is a little up so I'm so excited
because this stuff is what gets me
excited I know I'm weird there'll be a
whole video about how weird I am and the
weird things I like but this glass is
from Coco floss and I picked it fresh
coconut I picked up these are all three
separate ones so I picked up coconut I
picked up delicious mint because I
wanted to try it and then I picked up
orange Caracara orange which reminds me
of Caracara if you've watched thumbs up
in Turkey and their car car studio
anyway um so I really wanted to try
these out the packaging looks so cute I
just really watch how so excited so um
yeah I did
I picked these up so those are the only
things I got from octa Lee I did get one
package sent to me which is from Sigma
and Sigma had reached out before holiday
so before I even left for Christmas and
I wasn't gonna be in my house so I
couldn't get the stuff sent here so I
actually had them send it to me a little
bit later and that's why I came in this
month so I don't really technically
count it but I do have some Sigma
goodies I'm gonna be doing the whole
just kind of like review and opinions on
just all the stuff I got kind of a big
collective Sigma video so I think
that'll be fun and not like one product
base and you guys can know about my
thoughts on some of those products and I
might do like a little demo in it and
everything so anyway that is something
that technically came in but I don't
really count it as like me breaking
anything since it was it just worked out
with timing it wasn't about me accepting
it in this month and then last is just
given two things that I bought now I
bought these things literally yesterday
um today I'm filming in it is the 30th
and I bought them because I
ah it's gonna be in every video that I'm
filming tonight because I feel like so
many of these videos are very connected
now I personally don't think I went
crazy it was just at CVS and I bought
three products the first thing here is
from wet-and-wild this is the blossom
glow a mega glow highlighting powder
I've been wanting to try the wet and
wild highlighter since they first
launched and then when the highlight
palette came out I really want to try
that but I didn't pick it up and so I
was in CVS and we were celebrating me
getting 50,000 subscribers and I was
looking around at the new makeup and I
actually saw this in a display and I
haven't seen these in store ever like I
just don't ever go to the drugstore so I
was like you know what I'm gonna pick it
up so I picked this one up it's really
really pretty I'm wearing it on top of
another highlighter today but I will
come back and let you guys know what I
think about it but this is like an
exciting one it's inexpensive and I've
been wanting to try it for awhile so I
thought that was pretty good bye and the
last two things that I actually bought
these are from Maybelline this is the
fit me powder in fair I really been
wanting to try this out I've seen so
many people using it I'm running out of
my loose setting powder and I know I
have the back of one but I wanted
something that wasn't gonna be pink haze
so I picked this up and I'm really
excited to just try it out see how I
like it
again I'm wearing it today I hope it
ready with me using a lot of these
products but yeah I'm excited to try
this out and it's been something I've
wanted for a while and then since
Maybelline was buy one get one half off
I thought I would pick up the new brow
pencil as well this is the total
temptation brow definer in three hundred
blonde
I also heard Samantha March talked about
this and she said that she liked it I
believe so I was like I'm gonna give it
a try I'm gonna try it out so yeah I
picked up those two products I love the
packaging on both of these two so those
are the only things that I purchased and
then last the other things that came in
that I totally forgot about for my
birthday at Sephora I did get my
birthday gift I didn't buy any products
I have a gift card even and I didn't
pick up any products for my birthday
when I was in there I was like no you
can just buy them on February 1st if you
really want anything so I am pretty
proud of being so strong um I went to
the Sephora in Vegas because I actually
went to Sephora on my actual birthday
and I was so lucky because the guy that
was working let me have both I
originally
pick this out and he was like Oh when's
your birthday I was like today he was
like you know what I'm gonna give you
both so I've got the skincare one-two
so if you guys didn't know you can get a
birthday gift for free at Sephora just
for like basically having an account
with them and having your email so if
you don't have that already you probably
do but if you don't what are you doing
get on that but the makeup option this
year is a bite set and you get a bite
lip pencil in the color gloss glass just
a nice nude color I'm actually excited
this is something I was like wanting to
purchase at some point so it's awesome
to get it in a mini it's awesome to get
it for free so that's awesome and then
it also comes with a mini lipstick and
this is in the shade chai and I think
they go together pretty nicely they're
very similar colors like almost the same
color but I'm excited for those I think
it's a nice like color and they're free
so I'm like yeah I can't wait to try
them out and then with the skincare side
it's from glam glow so you get the glam
glow super mud clearing treatment I love
this mask I love the packaging of it too
I hope that this won't dry out very fast
I like to use this as a spot treatment
so I'm happy to have this and then I
really did want to try this out too so
that's great I'm so happy here this is
the glam glow glow starter mega
illuminating moisturizer I have this on
today this I've used it twice and this
Mel's like candy it's so insanely sweet
filling it's almost like a really cotton
candy sugar body mist like that's
literally what it smells like so it's
pretty intense I don't know how I feel
about this product super blood I got it
in a small size though to try it out
since it was something I was like
looking at because I really have enjoyed
the first aid beauty moisturizer that's
kind of luminizing so this is in a
similar vein and I want to try it so
that's so exciting
so I know it seems like I brought a lot
of products in and it is a lot of
products but when I think about how much
I actually spent it's really only the
end portion so I'm really happy about
that it was for a pretty big
accomplishment so that's pretty good
let's get into my thoughts on the know
bye because I feel like I'm not I'm not
super into the no bi and I also don't
hate the no bi I like the no bi because
it did make me more aware of my
purchases and what I was bringing in and
so it was definitely more of a decision
like I'm choosing to step over this line
right now I'm you know I'm making this
decision do I want to do this it
definitely made me think more which I
liked and appreciated from the know bye
I also didn't buy anything at Sephora
when I went in there just to get my free
gift and who knows what I would have
done had I not been on the know bye I
might have used my gift card or spent a
little bit money or whatever it was so I
think there were a lot of times where
being on the no buy did stop me when I
was in situations or at least made me
think more I also think I didn't
purchase very much from Sephora during
the sales which was great I also didn't
purchase much from colour-pop which I
feel like I probably would have at least
placed one order just because they have
a last sales section and I don't know
colour-pop always gets me I feel great
about that one of the things that I'm
like it's because obviously it wasn't
successful in the sense that I did
purchase some things but I don't feel
bad about buying those things either so
I feel like being on a no buy and then
technically breaking it makes it seem
like you're breaking all the rules and
you're not doing what you should and you
should feel bad about it but I don't I
don't feel bad about what I bought I'm
excited to try this things out the
things I've been wanting to try for a
while and I wanted to do it I think more
than anything I love I is better for me
and I just like the the check that it
gives me when it comes to questioning my
purchases and that's really what I find
for me and nobody to be useful for so
I'm not sure if I'll ever do like I know
buy again or maybe I'll I'll just get an
inkling to do it but because nobody
wasn't insanely difficult for me and I
don't have like all these feelings of
guilt or like bombardment I think that
I'm in a good place I want to continue
to be in that place and it's a constant
thing because you easily could just go
buy everything again but I really do
want to just continue to try to remind
myself that there are other things in
life that make up not to spend all of my
money on makeup not to buy all the new
releases and just keep questioning why I
want to make purchases and keep you know
being familiar with my own collection
and want to have and why I don't need
other products because these are very
similar and if I want to do something
like that palette could give me do I
have something similar in my collection
that will feed that desire so I don't
have to buy that item so I want to
continue doing that and I feel like I've
been doing a good job
I definitely I'm really proud of myself
regardless that this isn't you know
completely a success going forward I
think I want to try to just continue to
stay on a low buy on fire
receiving PR or free items because for
me it really is about spending my actual
money yeah um you know like I want to
have my finances go to other things in
make up I also get a lot of gift cards
because of octoly so a lot of the times
I can have a lot of like money to
Sephora and I want to utilize that money
toward new releases that I want things
that I want to talk to you guys about
and bring on my channel which I'm not
someone who's super product review based
on this channel I feel like I do other
things but if there is something that I
want or that you guys really want to see
or whatever it is I want to use those
gift cards to buy that stuff where I do
want to spend my own money on beauty is
for the items in my brand's I want to
try for 2018 so I've already checked one
of those off my list
I did buy some juvies play stuff so I'm
so excited I think I'm gonna make it
like a series us throughout the year as
I try those things and give you the
reviews on them I think that will be
really fun so that will hopefully be
coming soon I just want to test them
even longer and do some looks and
whatever with that video but I want to
try some glossier stuff and all that so
I can actually hit those goals try some
new brands bring some new content to you
guys and the only other thing is
obviously make it from a kit I'm okay
with buying with whatever I need cuz I
need what I need for my job so anyway
this kind of got into like a financial
like your goal or whatever but I just
wanted to give you guys an update on how
I felt about the no buy I haven't
technically done a no buy before so
those are my thoughts on it I thought it
was really great
I definitely applaud people who can go a
whole year without buying makeup even if
you have very similar colors and you
know of how its similar sometimes it can
be hard and I I do I just love makeup
you know I do like purchasing some
things here there I just don't want to
buy everything and I want to just be
satisfied with the purchases I do end up
making so anyway that's like my channel
hello welcome do it that's everything
for this video guys I hope you enjoyed
the update let me know how your nobody's
have gone what your thoughts are no byes
are if you've done one if it was
successful any of that I think it's just
kind of interesting but um I will see
you in my next video thank you so much
