Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm doing another tag video I know
these are just so fun and I enjoy doing
them so this one I was actually tagged
by Kelly Gucci was who created this if
you guys don't know her channel of
course I'm gonna leave her link down
below definitely go check her out she's
super sweet she does really great
content super original ideas and I know
you guys would love her so this tag is
all about if you could only keep one
product which one would you keep and I
think this is really fun it's kind of
like a new take on like a ride-or-die or
something like that so you guys are
gonna find out the products that I love
the absolute most in here I decided to
go through all the different categories
of makeup that I have and what I do in a
daily routine for my face and so these
are the products I would keep if I could
only have one of them in my collection
first I'm gonna start off with primer
and this one is kind of hard for me
because I just feel like I'm in the
process of testing so many primers out
so when I was looking at first I was
like I don't have a primer and then I
was like oh no I do have one I think I
just like to forget about this one
because it's so expensive this is the
YSL Touche cloth blur primer I always
talk about this but when I first tried
this I got it sent to me from octa Lee
in this tiny little container and this
is a new one but I tried it and I didn't
like it because back then I really was
into like full coverage matte foundation
and I did like the way this out on my
skin under that and I got a little bit
oily and whatnot but now for how I like
to do my foundation I love this this
does everything I needed to do it
smooths it Prime's it kind of
moisturizes and it fills in a little bit
of pores it smells great the only thing
I don't like about it well two things I
don't like that it has gold flecks in it
I don't know why there's gold glitter in
this I don't find that it translates on
the skin but it's just like weird like I
get that it's like why is Ellen crazy
and so expensive but they didn't need to
do that it doesn't have any purpose when
it comes to this primer and in the price
point I think this is like fifty two
dollars which is really expensive but
honestly after I finished this if I'm in
a position to purchase that primer I
will probably do it during one of the
sales where you get like 20% off from
Sephora I do like it that much it's
really
next we're gonna move on to foundation
and this one is pretty easy for me I had
one that was like almost there but I
mean this one just ones out and that is
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD I have my
favorites guys and I love them they're
my favorites for a reason the reason I
love this is because it's a medium
coverage I feel like it works for almost
all skin types and they have 40
different shade so it works for all skin
tones it works for all ages like there's
just so much about this foundation I
love I think this is really buildable I
do remember again not liking this
foundation though back when I had some
more like cystic acne for whatever
reason when I first moved to LA I had
just like really bad like cystic
hormonal acne and it did not cover I
remember getting it and being like this
sucks
I can't wear this so if you have really
bad breakouts or a lot of redness and
just like blemishes to cover this isn't
going to do that but if you already have
any skin or you want a skin like finish
to your foundation this is amazing and I
love it
next we're gonna move on to concealers
and I'm kind of surprised because I feel
like Maybelline fit me reigned for so
long for me but since I got my new one I
just don't like it as much as I like
this one this is the Milani retouching
erase concealer it's so great I love it
so much highly suggested it's dirty it's
gross it has a sponge there's some
constituent but overall I keep
repurchasing it and I do really like it
I wish it would come in like one more
fair shade because sometimes this can
look a little bit yellow and tiny a tiny
bit too dark on me but it is also winter
so that could be it also if you notice
that I'm talking lower I just realized
it's kind of late and I don't want to be
late yelling about makeup to my
neighbor's so yeah for powder I did pick
anything because at the moment I don't
have a Holy Grail I don't have something
that I would just be like this is what I
am i purchasing I probably would either
I mean maybe pick up something I already
have but maybe just pick up something
brand-new and try something new in
general I just know that I would pick up
a loose powder that's all I know for
sure
next is bronzer and this should come as
no surprise this is the butter bronzer
from Physicians Formula I think this is
great it's my second one that I've gone
through I really enjoy it
it gives me a nice subtlety of bronze
without getting too over
heavy-handed that's what I mean it just
works really well and I'm wearing it
today but I also have my milk bronzer
stick underneath it I love that thing
too that is so good
guys that is like one of the best
products moving on to blush again
nothing new this is the benefit rocket
or I think this is the perfect blush
like if you have to pick the perfect
blush this is it so good it has a
shimmer to it but it's nothing too
metallic it adds some life to the face
it's not overly pigmented where you know
you put your brush in it and you have
clown cheeks immediately and that's what
I look for in a blush I don't really
like face products that are too
pigmented right off the bat like I know
that looks good in a swatch and I know
that it seems like so awesome but in
reality when you're actually working
with it I feel like it gives you less
control as an artist I'd rather have
something I can build up and like you
know get to an intensity I want whether
that's like a level 1 or level 11 turn
it up to 11 you know what I mean so yeah
I love that flush it's so great I don't
have a ton of benefit products but
that's what I really love next is a
highlighter and this is something that's
probably gonna be a little bit different
or I don't know I mean I think this
one's really good but I decided to go
with the essence pure nude highlighter
this one is just really great out of
everything in my collection I didn't
want to pick anything that was like
limited edition or something I couldn't
actually purchase again so I thought
this one was the kind of winner I love
the price point of this and I think that
this is a nice everyday highlighter that
you can build up if you want to and you
can make it like a little bit more
metallic if you use like a setting spray
and kind of finesse it but other than
that it just looks really nice on the
skin it doesn't emphasize texture I love
the price point once again and this is
the one I would pick out of everything I
have in my collection it's really good
so different than the white Wild mega
glows I think those are pretty but I
definitely think that they're kind of
glittery so far with what I've tried
next we're gonna move on to eyes I'm
gonna start off with the palette I guess
and again no surprise I picked my water
in Renaissance I was looking through all
the different eyeshadow palettes that I
have and honestly this is the one that I
can do anything I need to with I'm using
this palette on my eyes today except for
the pink and I think it's just so pretty
I love the warm shades I've hit pan on
multiple colors in here for me I love
that you can do something warm or cool
you have just the perfect amount of
shimmers everything else is matte
Vermeer is so pretty on the lid if you
want to do something gold you have it
and then antique bronze is so beautiful
as well I also love that this has light
enough shades in it for me to do
transitions I just honestly the formula
is amazing so yeah this is the palette I
definitely choose like if I had to just
grab something I couldn't use anything
else I know I could make multiple looks
out of this that would satisfy me
creatively but would also look good for
like everyday when I wanted something
more neutral for brows again you guys
called it this is my ELF brow pencil in
taupe I love this it's cheap it works I
will say it was a bit of a tie between
this and the color pop one but I just
find the color pop one doesn't satisfy
enough for the full brow whereas if I
use a light enough hand I can do this on
the entire brow from the front to the
tail so I love that it's so good for the
price and then for mascara I chose the
Urban Decay perversion it's my favorite
I will say though I only like the mini I
don't like the full size I did have
someone request a video for me to do
like minis that are better than the full
size but when I'm thinking about it I
honestly don't have that many like this
is one but I don't have a ton of
products that I've tried that the mini
is better I don't really I don't know
like it's either like a primer where
it's like it doesn't really matter I
want to do something with Vinny's but I
don't know how to make it work so I need
to get creative on that anyway I love
this mascara it's super black I love the
way it makes my lashes like fan out
they look really fluffy and pretty and I
just enjoyed this mascara the full size
isn't bad I just I definitely feel like
the wand is maybe a little bit smaller
with the mini and I'm able to like get
closer to the lash line and just build
the volume better but um yeah I enjoy
this a lot and then last to talk about I
have some lip products so I decided one
category to be like a lipstick slash lip
gloss and for that I chose the NYX
butter lip gloss I really enjoy these I
think they're really affordable and I
love the way they feel on the lips
they're moist erisa
and they aren't sticky this
the shade of Claire but honestly when I
was calculating this I was thinking like
you could pick any shade or I could have
multiple shades it's just like this
specific product I think this is really
great I will see the bareMinerals lip
glosses the Jena nude ones were in a
close second so that was like the other
one I was potentially gonna pick I love
my fen cheek gloss balm but sometimes I
want just different colors and those
lines offer that for me that's why I
pick something different but I think
these are great I also love the smell he
smells so good
I really enjoy that too it's just like a
extra little touch and then I decided to
break off like lip balm slash treatments
into their separate category because I
wanted to pick something for that and
this is something that's fast becoming a
favorite it's Dylan edge lip sleeping
mask and it's amazing you can use like
just a little bit of this if you wanted
to as an actual lip balm but I love it
as a mask too first off the smell smells
like strawberries it smells so good but
it just feels so nourishing and just
plush on the lips it's amazing I also
really enjoy that when I went up in the
morning after I put quite a bit of this
on I don't have my lip gent like peeling
I don't know if you guys I've noticed
that with other products or if it's just
me and my weird old lips but if I put a
lot of lip balm on at night when I go to
bed the next morning it's like almost
like a layer of my lip peels off it's
like really weird but that does not
happen with this they just feel plump
and moisturized but they don't have that
weird peeling I mean it doesn't hurt
there's nothing like necessarily bad I
didn't think it was anything that weird
before um but now that I've tried this
I'm like wait this isn't happening and I
enjoy that it's not so highly suggest
this I know this is just small size but
I will be purchasing the full once I run
out of it alright guys that's everything
for the tag I hope you enjoyed seeing
some of my absolute favorite products
the things I would repurchase if I could
only have one these are them so thank
you so much for watching and thanks to
Kelly for creating the tag it was super
fun to do and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
