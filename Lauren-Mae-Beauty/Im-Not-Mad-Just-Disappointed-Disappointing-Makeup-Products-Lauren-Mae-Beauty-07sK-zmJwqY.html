Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a
disappointing products video I am about
to go to Arizona for the holidays and
when I do that I like to clear out my
makeup stuff bring anything I'm
decluttering or that I don't want and so
I'm gonna be getting rid of some of this
stuff so I thought I would tell you guys
about it before that happens
um I don't want to do the disclaimer so
just know that these are products didn't
work out for me if they work out for you
that's awesome it's not meant to be rude
or like personal it's just like they
didn't work out dude I don't know what
else to say but I'll tell you about it
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna title this I'm
not mad I'm just disappointed and these
are all products that are just they just
don't work out and maybe they're not the
worst ever but like you kind of
disappointed me man like I wanted you to
be better you didn't work out the way I
thought you would so they're on a scale
like some of them are just like not good
and some of them are like they didn't
work out for me but they could work out
for other people they're not complete
crap you know it's kind of a lot of
stuff so I'm gonna start off with the
makeup stuff because I know that's like
probably the most exciting and the
things that I would want to see first in
a video so I won't cheesy oh I'm gonna
start off with some face stuff first
this is the color pop concealer it's the
no filter concealer I have mine in fair
neutral I don't like this I don't think
it's good this is very inexpensive it's
only five dollars so that's why I was
excited plus I really do like color pop
stuff
but this stuff dries down darker than it
is so it's not very highlighting which I
don't like to go like crazy highlighting
underneath my eyes but I definitely
don't want it to be like dark underneath
my eyes so I just I don't get along with
this I like something more moisturizing
even if it's less pigmentation that's
fine with me I'd rather my under eyes
like look nice instead of like cakey or
creepy or dry so yeah I don't enjoy this
I'm gonna let this dry for a little bit
and then we'll put the other swatch next
to it and you'll see what I'm talking
about it's just not worth the money
there are so many other concealers
either for the same price or even a
little bit more that are worth it
usually it's tops so either like even a
little bit less but like no probably
or but worth it I have another concealer
here that just wasn't into my favorite
this was actually sent to me from
amazing cosmetics and it's the amazing
concealer illuminate now I just find
that their concealers are to like just
not my style they are too thick for me
and if that was it
you could definitely make it work it
wouldn't be bad but this has glitter
particles in it and so when you start
like buffing underneath the eye when
you're putting powder on and as you have
this on you it looks like fallout from
your eye shadow has gotten on your under
eye that's what this looked like and
that's not cool to me it's just not
worth it and I know this is a pricy
product again there are just so many
inexpensive things at the drugstore that
I think work better than this if you
want some suggestions I love the
Maybelline fit me and that's one of my
all-time favorites I also really like
the Milani erase and retouch or whatever
concealer I think that is an amazing
product I am out of it right now and I'm
sad so those are the two concealers I
suggest instead of those okay so we've
seen this that's it now right write down
a little bit look at that that's the
difference yo no I have not heard anyone
say crap about that what the no I'm just
not down like I get that things dried
down it's not necessarily like oxidizing
but like that's an issue to me and it's
not what I want like that is so dark
compared idli I'm gonna stick to face
product so this is actually just a mini
little sample and you know don't get me
wrong I wanted to like this product job
but this is the Fenty Beauty Pro filter
foundation I have mine in 150 I just
don't like the way this wears on my skin
it looks really pretty at first and it's
nice and full coverage if that's
something you like but I morally and as
a swears throughout the day on my
glasses it just turns into a bad
situation really fast once it starts
going and it just isn't my preferred
style of makeup and where I was hoping
that this would be like amazing and I
would like get me back into more full
coverage foundations but it didn't work
out for me definitely disappointing for
me I know a lot of people like it but it
is not my name
next to have an eyeshadow primer this is
the laura mercier eyeshadow primer in
wheat and I got this is just like a
hundred point perk or something I don't
like this at all this does have a tint
to it which personally this one is just
too dark for me I like my eye base to be
if anything lighter than my skin not
darker so that just already kind of
doesn't work out but whatever you could
get a different shade the reason I don't
like this is it just kind of almost
creates this like weird film on your
eyes and I just don't like the way it
Prime's them I don't think it's bad in
the sense that it doesn't work I just
don't like that there are so many
cheaper products I love the elf one I've
been using lately so much more than this
it's like amazing compared to this just
no it's not worth the money just
disappointing I was super excited to try
it out but it just it just isn't what I
like
next is a powder this is from Koki
cosmetics and this is a finishing powder
but it's green I ordered this off of
actually so I did get this unto me I
actually had ordered the translucent one
but they didn't have that they ran out
or whatever so they sent me the green
one and to me it's not that this product
is just like bad and just think it's
like gimmicky I guess it's grain powder
which is gonna counteract I guess some
redness but it's just like I don't
understand no it doesn't necessarily
leave a green tint but at the same time
it kind of does and do you put this on
top of your foundation but like if
you've already have foundation on you've
probably already gotten rid of all the
redness that you wanted to so why would
you use this to use this under the
foundation which I've heard people do
that like to prime their face and stuff
but like it I know I I think that's
enough of an explanation it just doesn't
quite work next is actually a skincare
product but since we're talking about
the face I thought I would mention this
this is the origins
using refreshing eye cream to brighten
into puffs I actually used to really
like this I remember when we lived in
Arizona and I got a sample of this and I
enjoyed it so much and it was being
rigged about by Ingrid and all the
people I loved to watch so I got it and
I loved it but I got this sent to me
from Influenster and I my husband's been
like going at it but it just is too
illuminating and honestly it's not that
hydrating what I love in an eye cream is
something that sinks into the skin
really fast really hydrates the area and
prepares it for makeup or at night just
gives it a lot of moisture so that again
we're preparing it for the next morning
for makeup and just like giving it the
moisture it needs so it's nice and soft
and plump and isn't going to get
withered and wrinkled and like dry and
gross and this just doesn't do it like
if you're gonna just don't I don't think
this is worth it I think you should buy
like a really good eye cream that's
hydrating and then you can put some
products on it to illuminate it or
whatever but I just don't think that
this works very well for the price
another eye product that I did not like
this is the genuine glow natural
skincare essential eye serum now this is
from a more natural brand which i think
is great but something that I mentioned
when I did a review on this already is
that I don't understand with natural
brands they name things like serums and
moisturizers but it's an oil let's call
it an oil it's an oil this is in a
rollerball which i think is great
packaging for it it's easy to use but I
just find this is kind of heavy on the
under eye I don't like using it it
definitely has a bit of a strong smell
like a very natural smell it just wasn't
what I wanted and it's disappointing
because I wanted this to be like
something like the Dermalogica serum
they have one that's just like almost
like water and it just sinks into the
skin that's what I thought I was getting
and that is not this and it's not my
favorite I thought I only had a couple
face products left but I keep pulling
them out next is a primer this is from
Physicians Formula and it's the instant
ready face primer I was excited
try this out this came out at the
beginning of the year I also got the
concealer which sucked and I needed that
too so I don't know what's up with this
line this has a pump and the pump sucks
and at the beginning it would pump out
only like water and now it pumped out
all the water and now what's left in
there is like kind of like you know the
Smashbox like primer clear primer like a
very silicone e primer which I wouldn't
even be mad at necessarily but it's
impossible to get out with the packaging
because it doesn't go up the pump
anymore because it's like not as liquid
as it once was
it's just a fail all around like that's
just so sucky I never use this because
of the fact that it's hard to get out of
the packaging so I can't even tell you
really what it does on my skin it's just
like irritating I hate that perfect I
wish I did not spend the twelve dollars
or whatever it was on it definitely not
worth it I have a few eye products the
first one here I feel like I've
mentioned but I still haven't lying
around so I'm going to get rid of it now
this is the hard candy walked the line
liquid eyeliner this is like a glitter
eyeliner it's just not good don't get it
it's flaky and gross just spend the
money on a nice one or get the elf one
and spend even less money than that one
so yeah I just don't like that next is a
another color pop product this is the
brow boss gel I was so excited to try
this J kiss I talked about it being
great I knew that it wasn't going to be
like a gel I mean it was gonna be kind
of like a conditioning weird situation
I've tried this I tried to make it work
so much
it just doesn't it's just not my
favorite I don't have the brows for this
I need color in my brows because they
are blond on their own and so yeah if I
use this it like Gunks the product on my
brows and you can see it on top of the
other product so I really have two
spoolie it in but when I do that it
removes the color product air to cut
down and so that just doesn't really
work it doesn't give any hold so if you
have a lot of brow hairs or really
unruly brows this is not gonna hold them
for you
I almost feel like you're
putting in like a leave-in conditioner
in your brows like that's what this does
and that's fine and dandy but it doesn't
work for brow gel and it doesn't work
and it's not a needed step in my routine
I think the packaging is nice the price
isn't bad but it just is like an OK like
not like it's an okay product but just
like a product you say ok to for lips I
have two different products the first
one here this is a lot of the stuff that
sent to me I think it's because I I like
the stuff that I if I don't like it I
don't like it this is the brand one over
one and this is a like lip oil thing I
was excited to try this out the
packaging is a little bit kind of like
Jane Iredale but it's not my favorite
this is very liquidy and the smell of it
oh I just hate the smell it's very like
natural and like almost like rose but
not in a good way I just don't like the
feel of this on my lips it's very thin
and liquidy and like oily I just want to
take it off as soon as I put it on and
then that makes with the smell it's just
not worth it to me I suggest just like a
clear gloss or a gloss with a sheen to
it it just didn't work sadly for me so
hopefully my mom will like it it just it
didn't work well for me can I say that
again my gosh okay next is a product
from Dec of Scarlett now this came with
the deck of Scarlett palette I have a
whole review on that if you want to
check it out I'll leave it linked but
this is the lip pencil that came with it
you got a like pencil on one side which
I initially did not like because it's
very thin and greasy yeah the color is
pretty and fine but it just is like a
pretty greasy little pencil it wasn't my
favorite but what I did like was the lip
liner I was like I do like the lip liner
though I think it's really nice
this thing has dried out on me and so I
cannot even apply it like I used to be
able to I wore this in one of my more
recent videos and everyone really liked
the color and I like the color too but
my goodness I had lined my lips and put
the like lip color on top of it they
were so sticky and sticky
there and it was like hard to even put
the liner on it was just a mess I don't
think this is good thought I would just
give you an update disappointing even a
lip liner can't even make it through
just a few more things left guys next is
a product from kenra I like this
hairspray but it doesn't work it it
sucks I don't know what happened to it I
don't know why the sprayer stopped
working and got clogged and just sucks
but there is a ton of product in here
this is the volume spray number 25 it's
a cult classic product but it's
disappointing that something this
expensive did this in the container and
I can't even use the product so yeah I
talked about that in an empties but I
thought I'd reiterate it here that I
don't like that product and I'm out of
it next is a dry shampoo and I talked
about this in a recent empties - it's
from AG and it's the simply dry dry
shampoo it's just not worth the money
guys it doesn't work really well it
leaves a white cast like it's just all
the things that you're just like don't
like about a dry shampoo it's this it
just doesn't work get batiste if you
want something inexpensive if you want
to go for something that's more
expensive or luxury go with the Moroccan
oil one you'll love it it smells good it
works it's amazing
this just is like a waste of your money
and time just don't do it and last is a
shower gel which is a weird one because
I got this at Marshall's like a long
time ago and I finally was like oh I can
use it I've used up all my old bath and
Bodyworks ones and this is the flower
farm wild rose body wash I was so
excited to try this out and it's not
because it's old that it smells bad it's
just not a good rose scent and I hate
using it in the shower I like a nice
smell good shower experience like get
the sense going get the heat going it's
like a party in my shower but this is
this is not good I did not like the way
this smelled
oh it just is too floral and not sweet I
don't know it's just not good I'm not
gonna use it and I'm the type of person
that usually would like force myself to
use it up but I decided like nah dawg
I'm not doing it okay
well those were all the products that
we're disappointing
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
know these can seem a little negative
they're not it's just it's not a big
deal you know life moves on but I
thought I would let you know about the
products that come across that just
didn't work out for me things that I
don't suggest you pick up if you're like
me or have preferences similar to mine
let me know about some of your
disappointing products in the comments
and I will see you in my next video bye
