am super excited because I got an
influenster voxbox I just signed up with
influenster probably not even a month
ago I saw pretty pistol 86 or cherishes
video and she got a YSL mascara and I
was like I wanna lie so mascara and so I
signed up and I already got of my first
box so that's super excited just to let
you guys know influenster is like a free
example box company I don't know if that
makes sense so you sign up on their
website and you fill out some different
information like surveys and depending
on your answers and if you qualify you
will get sent different boxes full of
free products to try so doesn't cost any
money but you aren't going to get one
like every single month you might not
get one for a long time you might get
you no one really fast like I did it
just depends on whatever boxes they have
going on and things like that I will
leave a link down below in the
description box it's going to be one
that's like if you refer a friend you
get five dollars and they get five
dollars so just a warning throwing that
out there that's what it is but if not
just go to the regular website you can
just type it into Google if you don't
want to go through that type of like
affiliate or friend link anyway one more
thing too about influencer again all
these were sent to me for free to sample
and to give reviews on so they were
provided free and but anyone can do it
you don't have to like do YouTube videos
anyone can sign up and potentially get a
box so I wanted to get that out of the
way now let's get into it I'm not gonna
lie I totally opened this thing because
I couldn't wait i was so excited when I
got the email saying that I got this box
which this is the Bella box box so let's
get into it and I'll show you guys what
I got I don't really have reviews cuz i
just opened this and got this in the
mail yesterday so it is a cute it's such
a cute little pink box and inside that's
what it looks like you get some cards
here so one is like an information one
letting you know what each thing is and
then like the retail value for it this
is
a club w influenster card and it's a
subscription box i think for wine so you
can sign up and get wine sent to your
house and stuff and this is like a first
bottle for free type of voucher and then
this is like an ebay kind of offer as
well so these ones are just kind of like
promo type things promotional coupons
and then the other one lets you know
what's in it so let's get to it the
first thing here are these dub hold
blueberries dipped in creamy dove dark
chocolate we have already opened these
we each have one me and Sam and they are
pretty good these retail for not 899 188
to 269 so um yeah for a snack I guess
that's blueberries it's not horrible
pricing I don't know um personally I'm
not a fan of like fruit in my chocolate
like just give me the chocolate I just
want the chocolate I'm not about trying
to even make it look healthy like I just
want the chocolate so I wish these were
just little chocolate balls instead of
like a blueberry dipped in chocolate but
you know with that being said it's still
good if you like this type of thing
you'll definitely like that the
chocolate quality is very good it's dove
so yeah first thing was that what else I
felt like it was quite a bit of like
makeup type of stuff in here and like
beauty so I was really happy to get this
the next thing that I got here is this
Ecotools complexion the next thing that
I got here was this Ecotools complexion
collection mattifying finish powder
brush you can use it with loose or
pressed powder and I already opened this
again too but what I really liked how
the fresh one it is so soft it is like
super soft there's like one little
scraggly hair that I keep trying to pull
out but it won't come out but it's kind
of like duo fiber II like it's dense
here but it's not very dense at the top
and it is kind of like pinched in I
don't know if you can see how it's like
like thin it's like pushed pinched in
here so I'm going to be using this kind
of like as the way I contour just like
really lightly I'm really excited to use
it for that I
use a duo fiber brush from Real
Techniques that came in like one of
their limited edition sets right now but
I think this one will be really nice I
mean it'd be great for all over the face
but specifically that's probably what
I'm going to use it for something
excited to use it for that and I will
let you know what I think about it and
this retails for 899 yeah and it's a new
supposedly it is designed with specific
cuts for enhancement enhance performance
to maximize natural beauty and give you
a matte finish will continue on his
makeup stuff I got this Rimmel Kate Moss
scandalized mascara and it's the first
mascara made by kate moss and really the
interesting thing about this is that it
has a brush that's kind of weird it's
called a heart a broken heart shaped
brush which sounds interesting i'm going
to open it for us so we can open the
wand up i haven't like seen the wand in
real life just like on the packaging
that's the packaging on its really nice
cute packaging like a silver bullet and
it has her like signature here with a
little kiss mark which oh I'm sorry a
little heart that's really cute and this
is in the color black oh wow it's a big
brush I thought it was going to be
smaller than that but see how it has
that kind of like curve to it definitely
different haven't used anything like
that so we excited to try this out and
see if it can kind of what I hope it
will do is kind of like her curl the
lashes um up more because that's what i
really like i don't curl my lashes on a
daily basis I just use my mascara and
try to like wiggle it and get it to curl
itself so hopefully this will be awesome
i'm excited to test it out let me know
if any of you guys have used that before
um and how you like it i don't think
it's like brand new to the market i
think it's i think i've seen I've heard
about the broken heart brush um and that
retails for 699 I also got another rebel
Kate Moss makeup product in here this is
the lasting finish
stick in the color 33 and it is just
like a classic pink color um yeah I'm
gonna swatch it really fast that's it
there I actually used to have to I think
of the matte finish whines and I just
got rid of them actually in Mike like
de-cluttering video only because they're
kind of old um but that's a really
pretty color just a nice natural pink I
don't usually like gravity to this I
either go more nude or mavi or like
bright like why don't worry today so I'm
excited to give this a try it seems
really creamy and nice so that's great
and this retails for 549 okay we have
two more things in the box books i have
this sample size or travel size not your
mother's deja vu style extender which is
infused with red apples and berries and
it's supposed to lock in your style
until your next shampoo this immediately
reminded me of the living proof 1 i've
never used that one but it's like the
living proof style extender or primer
hair primer and this seems like it's
supposed to do the same type of job is
like prime your hair and keep your style
lasting longer this is a very fragrant
scent um it's sweet and I can definitely
smell the berries like I'm not surprised
berries are in here I don't know if
that's going to be annoying to me or if
it's a good thing so I think it just
I'll have to see it once it's in my hair
I'm really excited to try this though I
am someone who has like second day third
day hair don't wash my hair every day so
this would be awesome if it could keep
my hair looking more put together like
my hair you guys know it's crazy like I
have a lot of fine little baby hairs
that like when I sleep on them get
frizzy and insane so I'm hoping that if
I use this on the day like I washed my
hair and I get out and I you know style
my hair whatever I can use this and I'm
hoping it'll help keep like the
frizziness down and like it looked more
normal and together instead of like
seriously insane so I'm really excited
to try this this again is just the trial
size or travel size so it's not the full
size but this retails for nine dollars
in the full set so that is sooo
exciting in a does say it says includes
conditioners for long lasting for his
control yes please softness and chime so
I'm really hoping this works for me I
have tried a couple not your mother's
things and nothing has been that amazing
if anything I haven't really liked it so
high hopes hoping that this one will
turn it around for me there's one more
thing in the box now this one I did open
it earlier but I kept it all how it was
it came a little busted in the packaging
so came like this this is the sally
hansen airbrush legs but as you can see
it came with gunk on it so it one of
them exploded in here like the cap was
not on tight and it came with two
samples in there so yeah you can kind of
see it's all nasty oh I'm so I'm gonna
put that one back in there but let me
read off of the can't read the text
because it's all nasty okay on here it
says get irresistible perfect legs in an
instant and gorgeous healthy-looking
skin the lightweight formula Heights
imperfections and won't rub off on
clothes find airbrush legs in the sally
hansen section at your local retailer
and these are available in five shades
to match any skin tone i have two of the
medium ones and these are for your legs
specifically these I don't know if like
this size retails for 1399 I'm assuming
since he didn't put any other like
indicator in that'd be insane no
thirteen dollars for this I don't think
so i think it's a way bigger container
because that's a lot of money i'm
excited to try this personally i'm not
one to mess around with fake tan it's
just not my thing I don't have the time
I don't want to make the time personally
I'm okay with being pale I'll just
embrace it rather than fake tan every
five days like these girls I don't know
how to do it like I give them props I
think everyone has their own thing I'm
not like saying that self tanning is bad
it's just not my thing and personally I
feel more self-conscious when it's like
you know rubbing off or like looking
splotchy on
on the wrist and the ankles and stuff I
feel more self-conscious than confident
with that team so anyway I think these
will be kind of cool though because I
have a lot of scarring on my legs
because I'm a picker and when bugs bite
me I scratched them and then I get a
scab and then I like itch the scab off
I'm like horrible I'm so bad at it Sam
hates that I do that but I do so on last
summer we had like a million mosquitoes
in Arizona like it was crazy I've never
had that many mosquitoes ever and I had
like probably like 20 to 30 bites on my
legs in total at the same time and it
was so horrible like it was hard to
sleep an itch so bad but I have a lot of
scarring on my legs from that so these
if you were trying to like go to an
event and you just wanted it to look
better like a wedding or even like a job
interview because I find myself feeling
a little self-conscious about it when
I'm wearing a dress for an interview I
think this would be really awesome to
not only tan it but kind of disguise
that hyperpigmentation so that's that I
got two of them both in medium and
that's everything in the box I'm super
happy I mean all this stuff was free so
of course I'm excited to try it out and
see if I like it um I think sometimes in
the drugstore I don't care if it's
drugstore or anything like to spend
money on something that you've maybe
never tried is you know I could
potentially be a risk and so it's
exciting to get to try these things
about having to pay the money and then
get to see if I like them and then if i
do how awesome that I found something
with little no risk really um let me
know if you guys are signed up for
influencer if not if you want to sign up
definitely sign up it's fun it's free I
got a box and you could potentially get
a box it's really cool that's it again I
don't I mean I said it but i'll put it
down below put all the information down
below and i will let you guys know too I
mean you'll see stuff in my favorite to
do if I like stuff and I think that's it
one last thing in case anyone's
wondering on my lips right now I am
wearing the two face melted liquefied
long wear lipstick in the color melted
fuchsia I just bought this even though
I'm trying to be good we went to name
EES as a school field trip which
Amy's carries like so many brands and I
got a twenty percent off discount so I
got this I mean love it it's so pretty
mmm it smells so good these smells super
good if you were wondering anyway that's
not what this video is about but I
thought I'd just let you guys now I will
see you in my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
