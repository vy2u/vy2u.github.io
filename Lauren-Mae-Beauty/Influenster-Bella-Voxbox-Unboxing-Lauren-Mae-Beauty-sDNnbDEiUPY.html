am super excited because I got an
influenster voxbox I just signed up with
Influenster probably not even a month
ago I saw pretty pistol 86 or cherish's
video and she got a why to sell mascara
and I was like I wonder why I saw
mascara and so I signed up and I already
got off my first box so that's super
exciting just to let you guys know
Influenster is like a free example box
company I don't know if that makes sense
so you sign up on their website and you
fill out some different information like
surveys and depending on your answers
and if you qualify you will get sent
different boxes full of free products to
try so doesn't cost any money but you
aren't gonna get one like every single
month you might not get one for a long
time you might get you know one really
fast like I did it just depends on
whatever boxes they have going on and
things like that I will leave a link
down below in the description box it's
gonna be one that's like if you refer a
friend you get five dollars and they get
five dollars so just a warning throwing
that out there that's what it is but if
not just go to their regular website you
can just type it into Google if you
don't want to go through that type of
like affiliate or friend link anyway one
more thing too about influencer again
all these were sent to me for free to
sample and to give reviews on so they
were provided free and anyone can do it
you don't have to like do YouTube videos
anyone can sign up and potentially get a
box so I wanted to get that out of the
way now let's get into it I'm not gonna
lie I totally opened this thing because
I couldn't wait I was so excited when I
got the email saying that I got this box
which this is the bella box box so let's
get into it and I'll show you guys what
I got I don't really have reviews cuz I
just opened this and got this in the
mail yesterday so it is a cute it's such
a cute little pink box and inside that's
what it looks like you get some cards
here so one is like an information one
letting you know what each thing is and
then like the retail value for it this
is
a club W Influenster card and it's a
subscription box do you think for wine
so you can sign up and get wine sent to
your house and stuff and this is like a
first bottle for free type of voucher
and then this is like an eBay kind of
offer as well so these ones are just
kind of like promo type things
promotional coupons and then the other
one lets you know what's in it so let's
get to it
the first thing here are these Dubb
whole blueberries dipped in creamy dove
dark chocolate we have already opened
these we each have one me and Sam and
they are pretty good these retail for
not $8.99 188 to 269 so um yeah for a
snack I guess that's blueberries it's
not horrible of pricing I don't know um
personally I'm not a fan of like fruit
in my chocolate like just give me the
chocolate I just want the chocolate I'm
not about trying to even make it look
healthy like I just want the chocolate
so I wish these were just little
chocolate balls instead of like a
blueberry dipped in chocolate but you
know with that being said it's still
good if you like this type of thing
you'll definitely like that the
chocolate quality is very good it's dove
so yeah first thing was that what else I
felt like there was quite a bit of like
make up type of stuff in here and like
beauty so I was really happy to get this
the next thing that I got here is this
Ecotools complexion the next thing that
I got here was this Ecotools complexion
collection mattifying finish powder
brush you can use it with loose or
pressed powder and I already opened this
again too but what I really liked about
the fresh one it is so soft it is like
super soft there's like one little
scraggly hair that I keep trying to pull
out but it won't come out but it's kind
of like duo-fiber II like it's dense
here but it's not very dense at the top
and it is kind of like pinched in I
don't know if you can see how it's like
like thin it's like pushed pinched in
here so I'm gonna be using this kind of
like as the way I contour just like
really lightly I'm really excited to use
it for that I
use a duo fibre brush from Real
Techniques that came in like one of
their limited edition sets right now but
I think this one will be really nice I
mean it'd be great for all over the face
but specifically that's probably what
I'm gonna use it for something excited
to use it for that and I'll let you know
what I think about it and this retails
for $8.99 yeah and it's new supposedly
it is designed with specific cuts for
enhancement enhance performance to
maximize natural beauty and give you a
matte finish will continue on his makeup
stuff I got this Rimmel Kate Moss
scandal eyes mascara and it's the first
mascara made by Kate Moss and really the
interesting thing about this is that it
has a brush that's kind of weird it's
called a heart a broken heart shaped
brush which sounds interesting I'm gonna
open it for us so we can open the wand
up I haven't like seen the wand in real
life just like on the packaging that's
the packaging on it it's really nice
cute packaging like a Silver Bullet and
it has her like signature here with a
little kiss mark which oh I'm sorry a
little heart that's really cute and this
is in the color black oh wow it's a big
brush I thought it was gonna be smaller
than that but see how it has that kind
of like curve to it definitely different
haven't used anything like that so we
excited to try this out and see if it
can kind of what I hope it will do is
kind of like her curl the lashes up more
because that's what I really like I
don't curl my lashes on a daily basis I
just use my mascara and try to like
wiggle it and get it to curl it itself
so hopefully this will be awesome I'm
excited to test it out let me know if
any of you guys have used that before
and how you like it I don't think it's
like brand new to the market I think
it's I think I've seen it I've heard
about the broken heart brush and that
retails for $6.99 I also got another
rebel Kate Moss makeup product in here
this is the lasting finished lipstick in
the colour 33 and it is
just like a classic pink color um yeah
I'm gonna swatch it really fast that's
it there I actually used to have two I
think of the matte finish ones and I
just got rid of them actually in my like
decluttering video only because they're
kind of old um but that's a really
pretty color just a nice natural pink I
don't usually like gravitate to this I
either go more nude or Mavi or like
bright like what I'm wearing today so
I'm excited to give this a try it seems
really creamy and nice so that's great
and this retails for 549 okay we have
two more things in the box books I have
this sample size or travel size not your
mother's deja vu style extender which is
infused with red apples and berries and
it's supposed to lock in your style
until your next shampoo this immediately
reminded me of the living proof one I've
never used that one but it's like the
living proof style extender or primer
hair primer and this seems like it's
supposed to do the same type of job is
like prime your hair and keep your style
lasting longer this is a very fragrant
scent it's sweet and I can definitely
smell the berries like I'm not surprised
berries are in here
I don't know if that's going to be
annoying to me or if it's a good thing
so I think it just I'll have to see it
once it's in my hair I'm really excited
to try this though I am someone who has
like second day third day hair I don't
wash my hair every day so this would be
awesome if it could keep my hair looking
more put-together like my hair you guys
know it's crazy like I have a lot of
fine little baby hairs that like when I
sleep on them get frizzy and insane so
I'm hoping that if I use this on the day
like I washed my hair and I get out and
I you know style my hair or whatever I
can use this and I'm hoping it'll help
keep like the frizziness down and like
it look more normal and together instead
of like seriously insane so I'm really
excited to try this this again is just
the trial size or travel size so it's
not the full size but this retails for
nine dollars in the full set so that is
super exciting and it does say it says
includes Kim dish
for long-lasting frizz control yes
please
softness and chime so I'm really hoping
this works for me I have tried a couple
of not your mother's things and nothing
has been that amazing if anything I
haven't really liked it so high hopes
hoping that this one will turn it around
for me there's one more thing in the box
now this one I did open it earlier but I
kept it all how it was it came a little
busted in the packaging so came like
this this is the Sally Hansen airbrush
legs but as you can see it came with
gunk on it so it one of them exploded in
here like the cap was not on tight and
it came with two samples in there so
yeah you can kind of see it's all nasty
oh I'm so I'm gonna put that one back in
there but let me read off of the can't
read the text cuz it's all nasty okay on
here it says get irresistible perfect
legs in an instant and gorgeous
healthy-looking skin
the lightweight formula hides
imperfections and won't rub off on
clothes fine airbrush legs in the Sally
Hansen section at your local retailer
and these are available in five shades
to match any skin tone I have two of the
medium ones and these are for your legs
specifically these I don't know if like
this size retails for $13.99 I'm
assuming since you didn't put any other
like indicator in that'd be insane
though $13 for this I don't think so I
think it's a way bigger container cuz
that's a lot of money I'm excited to try
this personally I'm not one to mess
around with fake tan it's just not my
thing I don't have the time I don't want
to make the time personally I'm okay
with being pale I'll just embrace it
rather than fake tan every five days
like these girls I don't know how to do
it like I give them props I think
everyone has their own thing I'm not
like saying that self-tanning is bad
it's just not my thing and personally I
feel more self-conscious when it's like
you know rubbing off or like looking
splotchy on that
on the wrists and the ankles and stuff I
feel more self-conscious than confident
with that tune so anyway I think these
will be kind of cool though because I
have a lot of scarring on my legs
because I'm a picker and when but spite
me I scratch them and then I get a scab
and then I like it's the scab off I'm
like horrible I'm so bad at it Sam hates
that I do that but I do so um last
summer we had like a million mosquitoes
in Arizona like it was crazy I've never
had that many mosquitoes ever and I had
like probably like 20 to 30 bites on my
legs in total at the same time and it
was so horrible like it was hard to
sleep an itch so bad but I have a lot of
scarring on my legs from that so these
if you were trying to like go to an
event and you just wanted it to look
better like a wedding or even like a job
interview because I find myself feeling
a little self-conscious about it when
I'm wearing a dress for an interview I
think this would be really awesome to
not only tan it but kind of disguise
that hyperpigmentation so that's that I
got two of them both in medium and
that's everything in the box I'm super
happy I mean all this stuff was free so
of course I'm excited to try it out and
see if I like it I think sometimes in
the drugstore I don't care if it's
drugstore or anything like to spend
money on something that you've maybe
never tried is you know could
potentially be a risk and so it's
exciting to get to try these things
about having to pay the money and then
get to see if I like them and then if I
do how awesome that I found something
with little no risk really um let me
know if you guys are signed up for
influence or if not if you want to sign
up definitely sign up it's fun it's free
I got a box and you could potentially
get a box it's really cool think that's
it
again I don't I mean I said it but I'll
put it down below put all the
information down below and I will let
you guys know too I mean you'll see
stuff in my favorites video if I like
stuff and I think that's it one last
thing
in case anyone's wondering on my lips
right now I am wearing the Too Faced
melted liquefied long-wear lipstick in
the colour melted fuchsia I just bought
this even though I'm trying to be good
we went to Namie's as a school field
trip which
Ami's carries like so many brands and I
got a 20% off discount so I got this and
I love it it's so pretty
mmm it smells so good these smells super
good if you were wondering anyway that's
not what this video is about but I
thought I'd just let you guys know I
will see you in my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
