I'm so happy to be talking to you guys
this is my first video that I'm filming
since I got back from Peru so I do have
quite a few that I filmed before I just
didn't have the chance to edit so those
will be coming on here kind of in
between my new videos that I'm going to
be filming just because I don't want to
waste the footage just because they're
older I think it's still relevant I
still worked hard on them um so I'm
still going to post though so if you see
something that seems older or I'm
referencing things out of order that is
why but anyway this video today is going
to be my influencer kerastase box box
review I got sent from Influenster the
kerastase box box now if you don't know
about influenster I've done a couple
videos with box boxes that I've gotten
in the past from Influenster it's a free
site anyone can sign up they send you
products and you're supposed to
influence other people about how you
feel about it so brands will send items
to influencer or like partner with
influencer to get either new products
out on the market um known or just get
like feedback on them and that is how
this one came about I've never tried
anything from kerastase before so I was
really excited about this box I do sell
it at work but it's expensive and I
really don't know much about it so super
exciting thanks to influencer for
sending me this and if you want to sign
up for influenster i will leave a link
down below if it's I believe a referral
link if I can but yeah check it out if
you're interested let's get into the
review it came with the shampoo and
conditioner but it also came with this
little card which i will be reading
because kerastase is a l'oreal paris
product but a lot of it is like in
French or like French terms and words
and yeah it's gonna be hard it's hard to
remember that so anyway this is
congratulations you've been selected to
test the new kerastase resistance there
a piece line so what's so interesting
about this line is that they claim that
this is the first reverse care product
so this shampoo and conditioner is
specifically for people with damaged
hair hair that needs smoothing and
restoring from a color or any type of
heat damage that you might have done to
it I think that's a really good fit for
me first off I have bleached hair which
immediately damages your hair I don't
heat style my hair with like tools that
much but I do use a blow dryer so um I
don't use it everyday but that also is
something that also damages my hair and
my hair just in general is quite then it
I if you've been on my channel a long
time you know I talked about how thin my
hair is all the time but I have very
thin fine hair and then with the bleach
it is also you know I would consider it
damaged from that so I was excited to
try this because I felt like I was a
good candidate for this you know
influencer does their best to find
candidates that are gonna be good and
this one was I feel like a really good
match what again what's unique about
this product is the fact that you use
your conditioner first and then you use
your shampoo after according to the card
it says on here that the conditioner the
first reverse care conditioner you're
going to use this product first so this
is the product i was using first in the
shower and this is going to kind of coat
the fiber and protect the fiber so you
put this in just like you would your
shampoo firs but it's a conditioner I
kind of tried to lather it I mean it
doesn't lather but I did try to kind of
like work it in like I would a shampoo
and then I rinsed it out and then you're
going to go in with your shampoo this is
a gel like a jelly-like consistency is
what they call it this is going to
envelop that fiber which has already
been conditioned with the conditioner
and reduce friction and then it's also
it says going to just helps with this
product going on second that your it
says delicate damaged hair is you
vitalize shiny and smooth I have been
using this shampoo and conditioner since
I got it i am at like the end of my time
to like review it or like talked about
it so I feel like I tried to give this a
really good shot of length of time so
that I could really tell you guys how I
felt about it overall I really do like
this product I think it works really
well I wouldn't say I saw a huge change
in my hair in the
damaged area but what I did like about
it is that I can have a shampoo and
conditioner that can treat and help with
my damaged hair and helps move and do
all these things but it's still
lightweight that is the biggest issue
that I find with shampoos and
conditioners anything that's smoothing
or that has protein in or anything like
that usually they're quite heavy and so
I find that with my thin fine hair all
it does is way my hair down so yeah
maybe it's a better quality hair but
it's pasted down in my head or I get
greasy super fast and with this one I
found that my hair could still be fealty
and have life I know I wear my hair up
in a ponytail or a button like this all
the time but I did find that you know I
could go a long time without getting
greasy without using my dry shampoo um I
wouldn't say necessarily longer than
other like lighter weight shampoos but I
was just happy that I could still get
those benefits while having a
lightweight shampoo so since you're
using the conditioner first I feel like
that's part of the reason this is such a
lightweight shampoo and conditioner said
is because the conditioner which is
usually the heaviest and the thing I use
the least of goes on first and then you
wash it out and then go on with shampoo
because of that combination plus in
general I just think they're lightweight
products I feel like it works really
well for fine thin hair if you had
damaged hair that an overprocessed hair
that was thick I don't think this would
be enough moisture for you honestly um
it felt weird at the end to my hair's
felt smooth and nice with just washing
out the shampoo but I do think that if
you're used to that really slick
conditioner feel it would be definitely
strange for you or maybe feel a little
drying for you if you were using this
correctly on accident I did use it the
opposite way because these bottles
although they are slightly different in
size and this one's like more glossy and
this one's mad they are very hard to
tell apart and in the shower you have to
like twist off the packaging which is
like a little bit annoying to me in the
shower you know you're just trying to
like get it done and so I did put in
like the shampoo first a couple times
and then
this I didn't see a big difference
honestly between doing that so I don't
know what that says overall though I do
really like this would i pay the amount
of money that these are going to be no i
wouldn't i would totally love to get
them for free we still carry stuff at my
store for about like forty dollars a
piece like 40 legend poo forty dollars
for the conditioner which is quite
pricey that's like you know eighty
dollars here you know pre-tax
potentially which is what I'm guessing
this would be about like thirty nine
dollars that's a lot of money for this
and I honestly just I don't think know
that it's not worth it but that's just
quite pricey I think Bumble and Bumble
is expensive and that's like 25 dollars
for the surf shampoo which is the one I
really like and 27 for the conditioner
and this is like 30 extra dollars on top
of that so I don't think I would ever
pay for this I think that it's a good
product though I do think it works
especially for thin again then fine hair
that's over processed I think that those
people would be the people that are best
situated for this product again I don't
think it's enough moisture for someone
with coarse hair curly hair you know
thicker hair it's just not going to give
you what you need you could follow up
like a leave-in conditioner or something
I think that would help I think really
the new thing about this a thing that
they're most like talking up and what's
different about this product is the fact
that you're using the conditioner
shampoo opposite of each other or how
you would normally is it which is cool
and all but I don't know if that really
does anything besides potentially leave
it less weight down than before okay I'm
like repeating myself at this point so
we're gonna stop talking about that
there i do want to mention really fast
this smell of these products is
absolutely amazing they just smell very
nice i think that they're it's a very
unisex scent I think guys would like
this girls would like the scent of this
it just smells really good and it did
feel luxurious using this product I did
enjoy using this product I'm going to
enjoy finishing these products that but
again price-wise I just don't think it's
worth the price I personally would
rather buy the bubbler mobile surf
shampoo the blue one I think it's the
only surf champion personally and that
would
sports for me so definitely I don't feel
like these did anything that amazing for
me to warrant spending 30 extra dollars
on even these anyway again thanks to
influence our for sending me these I do
think it's great if you were interested
and you already spend a lot of money on
you know shampoo and conditioner I think
go for it but I don't feel like you're
missing out if you're not again the
candidate like the perfect candidate
like I've already mentioned or if you
know you're not into spending that type
of money I don't think that you're going
to just be like missing out or like oh
dang it i wish i had it i hope you guys
enjoyed this review yeah it was really
awesome to try this out try something
other than makeup but it was relieved it
was really fun and it was exciting to
try a brand I've never tried anything
from before so definitely check out
influenced her if you're interested you
don't have to do videos to get stuff
