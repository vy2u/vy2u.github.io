video is going to be really exciting
because it is my influenster voxbox on
the YSL box i was so excited that I got
chosen for this box I have never owned
anything lyocell before so it was super
exciting to get that notification saying
that I was going to be getting this box
with two of Y cells newest products in
it so if you haven't heard about box box
it is a website now you can sign that
floor and they send you like PR type
samples and it could be anyone you don't
have to be on YouTube you don't have to
be someone special they just work with
companies to send out new products on
the market or just different things like
that so that people can try them out and
review them and they can get feedback on
them it kind of works out for everyone
because we get for your product and they
get feedback so yeah I'm excited to tell
you about them again because this is
influenced turret this was sent to me
for free I didn't pay for these items
but it was just because I'm signed up
for the website so i will have a link
down below it will be my referral link
if you want to just go to the website
you can always just do that though and
you can sign up yourself if you're
interested in receiving different boxes
they do a ton of different ones you
don't get every single box it's not like
a monthly thing but if you get chosen
for anything it's super awesome I
actually have someone from school who
signed up through influenster because of
me but he doesn't make videos or
anything like that and she got the
Maybelline foundation so you don't have
to have a lot of subscribers or a lot of
followers or anything like that to get
picked anyone could get picked so just
wanted to throw that out there let's get
into the review both of these products
were part of their new like primers that
they released so this is just the box
but i thought i'd show you they came in
the nice gold boxes this is it inside
its velvet pouch this is the two o'clock
blur Perfector I must say the packaging
is absolutely flawless it's so beautiful
i love that like baby pink color with
the gold it just looks so luxurious so
it's an a on that i do wish it had a
little bit more weight to it it's just a
plastic compact and i wanted it to be
metal i think it should be metal for $55
but this for
tails for $55 this is the full-size
product inside you get a mere sorry if I
blind you and then this is the product
itself this is kind of like the Mallee
primer that's like in this thing or dr.
feelgood by benefit or any of those
primers where you take a little sponge
and then you would dab it on that's how
this is it can be used on top of makeup
to mattify throughout the day it could
be used underneath makeup to prime lots
of different uses for this product now
it's funny because at the beginning of
this video I'm super excited and I am
I'm so grateful and I'm so happy to have
gotten these products but i will say
neither of these products work for me
particularly with the skin type I have
they're not products that I would ever
purchase um they just aren't worth the
money for my skin type and they just
don't work as well it's not even that I
think they're great products both of
them but I have combination oily skin
and that combined with my preferences
for makeup they just don't work on my
skin type and so for me they're a dud
but i think the product themselves are
beautiful again how you would apply this
the reason it doesn't work for me is i
get oily throughout the day my makeup
feels like it's slipping off a lot of
the time and i would probably only
really use this as like a touch-up
powder although it's not a powder it's
like a cream product that turns into a
powder on the skin but i don't think it
it really does it definitely has a very
slick feeling still it's kind of like
those silicon blushes that turn from
like cream to powder their powder and
they feel really silky smooth on the
skin but for me when i'm already gone
halfway through out the day that's not
what I need I don't need something
that's going to be silky smooth on my
skin necessarily because it doesn't make
me feel Matt I might look Matt but I
don't feel Matt I feel like I'm still
greasy like stuff is still swimming on
my face so that's the reason I
particularly don't like this product for
myself there's a lot of different ways
you can try it underneath your makeup I
just it just takes too long for me to
Pat this all over my face
I just like a liquid primer better for
that purpose because i'm using more of
it i think the best way to use this is a
touch of product especially again for
the price i want to be using it in the
best most economical way possible so i
can get my money's worth out of it and
use it for as long as possible but this
would be an amazing product for someone
with maybe just barely oily skin or even
with dry skin maybe they get dry
throughout the day this one would keep
them looking Matt I wouldn't disturb
their makeup they could Pat it on
throughout the day but it'd kind of be a
little bit more moisture again it does
dry down a little bit to eat what they
call a powder finish but it's a very
soft feeling on the skin so I think
someone with that type of problem or
maybe throughout the day they get a
little it gets a little cakey or get
some you know they have some like fine
lines that are showing through anything
this would be a great one to kind of
blur those areas um and touch up it just
does not work on my oily skin so I will
be trying to make this work you know
I've tested it out but I also i'm going
to continue to test it out because i
really wanted to work it's so beautiful
i really wanted to work maybe in winter
to when i'm not as oily it might be like
the perfect thing but definitely right
now for summer and with like oily skin
it just doesn't I don't feel fresh and
beautiful and like I still feel oily
when I use it so to me I'd rather like
save some money or even spend the same
amount of money but just on something
that's more targeted for me specifically
with all that being said this brings me
into the second product that i received
now this is the toosha clot blur
Perfector that was a blur Perfector this
is the two shakur primer this is just a
smaller size so it isn't the full-size
the full-size isn't out and this is only
point 33 ounces yeah I don't know if the
other one has the same type of formula
but it's kind of like but it's kind of
like a spatula very similar to the
hourglass mineral veil primer minis so
you use like a spatula to get it out
is a very like silicon type primer it
has gold sparkles in it that's something
that I would just be aware of I did
notice them when I just had the primer
on but once I put makeup on I did not
notice it this primer I definitely
prefer compared to the other one in use
wise I think it feels beautiful it has a
smell to it but it's a very not very
perfume but it definitely the smell but
I like the smell of it so it just feels
luxurious putting it on I think this
feels beautiful I think this would work
for so many people it would be so great
on anyone with dry skin or mature skin
or anyone looking to blur any
imperfections on the skin maybe you
don't do a ton of makeup on the skin you
just use a BB cream or you just use a
powder this would be so nice just to put
underneath just to give you that more
perfected look maybe you don't even put
any makeup on you just put this on it's
gonna make your skin look so nice and
more even more plump and just like lines
blemishes discoloration just all kind of
have this veil on it that looks natural
but more perfected so I really do like
this primer again it just doesn't work
for my skin I need a primer that's like
heavy duty it's going to like fill in
pores and keep me Matt all day long like
that's what I want I want something like
the Smashbox pore minimizer primer and
then maybe this on top but by itself
this just doesn't work for me I feel
oily I feel like my makeup is slipping
around so again I think this is a
beautiful product I think it's worth the
money if you are the right skin type for
this product and it work for you I wish
it worked for me I wanted to work for me
but um this is something that I will
definitely try to use again during
winter to see if it'll work for me then
and I can really just enjoy the benefits
of it but this is a really
on this one retails for $52 at sephora
just a little recap of the products
again I think they're both really good
if I had to pick one for you to get I
would definitely do the primer not the
Perfector just because I think you're
getting a lot of bang for your buck it's
a product you can use every single
morning you'll actually use and I just
that's the one I gravitate to the most
if you like something like the Malley um
I don't know what it's called you know
what I'm talking about the Malley primer
that's in the container like that or if
you like dr. feelgood or any of those
type of like primers or blotting like
bombs you probably would really like the
Perfector i'm still super happy you got
to check these products out and see them
for myself because I definitely wouldn't
have bought them on my own since I don't
own anything myself if you feel like
these are something that your skin type
would be good for I definitely suggest
getting a sample or going for it they
are great products and if you have extra
money to spend their very luxurious they
you know you feel special using them but
if you want something that's going to
like work well be a holy grail product
and you have oily skin I wouldn't
suggest them personally I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I wish it was more of
a positive review I think it's still
stayed really positive and I will see
you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
