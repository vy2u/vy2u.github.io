Lauren thank you so much for watching
today is my first video that I'm filming
back from Italy I know you guys have
heard about Italy so so much and thank
you so much to everyone who came over to
my Instagram saw the pictures watched my
instagram stories it was really fun
doing that and I still have so many
pictures I need a post but I feel a
little weird posting them now that I'm
like back in the States
so anyway today's video is going to be a
haul of all the things I picked up in
Italy I'm gonna start off with beauty
and skincare and then I am going to show
you guys some of the souvenirs and just
different things I picked up as well but
I'm gonna put that at the end so in case
you don't want to see it which I totally
understand you can just click out after
the beauty stuff I did show a few of
these items over on my Instagram again I
kind of gave you guys a little haul of
some of the things I'd picked up but
from that time I picked up a little bit
more so yeah I hope you guys enjoy one
more thing here at the beginning as well
let me know if you want me to do like to
get ready with me talking about Italy
and kind of like showing you clips there
I don't know if you guys want that I
kind of want to do it and I'm kind of
like and I don't know if you guys want
it so if there are enough of you who do
or if you have any questions about Italy
- maybe you can leave some of those and
I can talk about it maybe answer some
questions maybe be a little like helpful
about Italy in general I'm not sure but
let me know what your guys's thoughts
are about that in the comments and then
I'm gonna do one other Italy related
video and it's gonna be about products
that I ended up using and products that
I ended up not using and basically just
talking about like don't freaking
overpack just like don't do it okay but
other than that let's just get into the
whole but Italy haul so when it comes to
like actual makeup I don't feel like I
picked up too too much I was very
careful about the exchange rates and
making sure that I wasn't spending a ton
of money on makeup because it wasn't
anything I needed I was just buying it
if it was like an Italian brand or
something I hadn't seen before and I
really wanted to make sure that I was
getting it at a fair price so most of
these are kind of more drugstore as a
lot of these products are from the same
brand which is called Debbie it's de BBY
I picked these up when I was in Venice
we stopped in to a little pharmacy and
they had like a display and so I liked
what the prices were all about like 5
euro and under so that was like
reasonable to me so I picked some stuff
up from that so the first thing I have
here is the Debbie concealer solution
long-lasting concealer this is in the
shade 1 light beige and this might be a
little bit dark for me but I did get a
bit of a tan I don't know if you can
tell in camera but I've got a little bit
of a tan so I was hoping that this might
work at least first summer and I mostly
just wanted to at least try it so that's
it's watched there more than anything
it's more like my actual skin tone maybe
even the shade darker then something
like brightening under the eye so I'm
gonna try that out I haven't really used
it so I can't give you guys reviews this
is more I'm just like telling you guys
what I picked up because that's
something that I realized while I was
over there I just kept and makeup pretty
simple for the most part there were a
couple days that I had a little bit of
time but I mean it was just a lot we
were traveling a lot of different places
and it was kind of hot and I just was
like mascara brows a little bit of face
stuff done you know all the rest of the
stuff that I picked up from this brand
are for the eye so I picked up two of
the glitter liners I was super excited
to see these these were like three euro
something and I got a gold one which is
really really beautiful and then I
picked up this really pretty white one
kind of it it is like the exact same as
my Urban Decay pyrrha one like the same
colors and I'm not sure how available
this is in other places I'm not even
sure if this is like an Italian brand
specifically it was just a brand I
hadn't seen before sorry about the phone
call I feel like I'm really awkward
anyway like holding stuff like I haven't
filmed in a while so just you know bear
with me there are some swatches I hope
you guys can see and then that's the
concealer yeah it's a little dark Who am
I kidding with that one right okay I
picked up two different oh no this isn't
an eyeliner I got a lip liner I forgot
so I got a white eyeliner this is the
Kajal pencil in waterproof it's number
eight and I was excited about this
there's a swatch of it there I was
hoping that this would be really good I
do have it on my waterline today and
it's
nice it's not super opaque but at the
same time it's not like chunky so I like
that over the land come one I have been
using I thought I really liked that one
but the more I use it it just is getting
so soft and then like pieces go into my
eyelashes and I don't know it's not
turning out to be the white night I
thought it would be a white liner anyway
I got this lip liner this is the number
one Debbi lip pencil this is just a nice
nude I don't know it's very soft I'm not
sure how I like it and I don't know how
you like even roll this thing up it
looks like plastic so I don't know how
I'm supposed to sharpen this but there's
no way to just roll it so I think I'm
just gonna try to sharpen it and
hopefully it doesn't like crack in half
like those NARS pencils and then last
from the Debbie brand this is the
all-in-one mascara it's supposed to give
you length the volume curl lift and it's
supposed to separate this is your one
and done thing I have not used it yet
but the wand is very interesting-looking
I actually didn't see a sample of this
before I picked it up so I didn't know
but it's a plastic bristle wand I don't
know it's just interesting I don't know
why it's like kind of reminded me of
like a dinosaur tail or something but
that's what I'm getting from it so yeah
I have that and I'm excited to try it
out and really the last makeup item I
picked up is from the brand Douglas I do
believe this is an Italian brand or at
least it's made oh it's made in Italy
but then it says Douglas cosmetics
Germany I'm not sure but this is the
shade one and it's a foundation stick
I've been really into cream foundations
lately I picked up that covergirl one
before I left which I already hit pan on
it I love it I'm wearing it today I just
I love it so much anyway I thought I
would pick up something that's super
easy to use I love stick foundation so
this is a swatch of it there and I'm
scared this is a little bit dark for me
as well I'm hoping again for summer I
can use it and it's kind of a sheer one
like it's not super full coverage so I
can also get away with it for that but
yeah I picked this up I think this was
like 13 euros so it was a bit more
expensive for me at least
especially when you calculate in the
conversion but I thought I'd go for it
because it was one of the least
expensive things and
comes to makeup that's everything I
picked up in Italy they have like
pharmacies where you can get like
skincare and sunscreen and things like
that but they don't have a ton of
cosmetics like they're all very
different it's not like in the States
where you go to Walgreens and there's
like this whole cosmetic section if they
do have cosmetics it's usually something
very mineral based and very basic like
simple natural colors and everything so
it was kind of difficult to find places
that I felt like had different brands
that I hadn't seen before they had
Sephora and some of the more touristy
places but I wasn't going to spend more
money on the same products I could buy
here and then of the brands that they
did have I just I just wasn't drawn to
anything so that's what I found that I
felt like ticked all the boxes for me
like price wise is pretty reasonable and
was exciting to me in some way or
another so yeah that's all I could find
I'm sure there are places I just didn't
look or didn't know to look because it's
just a different type of way to sell
cosmetics there I feel like when it
comes to the stores that they're in
anyway let's get into the rest of the
beauty products that I did pick up I
have some skincare here I was very aware
of prices and so for anything that I
could get a better price on it there
than I could hear what the conversion
rate I made sure to pick up if it was
something I liked so I did pick up a two
back of Bioderma these were like 2150
like 21 year old fifty and so I picked
up the 2-pack and in the States they
usually retail for about like I think
twenty dollars a piece so that was a
pretty good deal I really love my seller
waters you guys know that but Bioderma
is like the original and I really do
enjoy it so more things from Bioderma
I picked up the hydro bio serum this is
a moisturizing serum I've actually used
up a full one of these before and again
it was at a better price point it was
like 14 euros so that is better than
the-- like twenty four five dollars that
it is in the States I also picked up a
newer product I believe buy them this is
the hydro bio cream I didn't have a very
heavy moisturizer to put on our skin
when we went out there the one that I
was using from number seven was almost
gone and I didn't want to bring it
because I knew it wasn't gonna last the
whole time and I wanted as an empty it
was this whole like thought process in
my head so when I was in the store and I
saw this I decided to pick it up and
again it was at a better price and I
would have gotten it if I ordered
Beauty Bay or Beauty lish or wherever I
can get Bioderma we've actually already
used up quite a bit of this because I
did pick this up at the beginning of the
trip and me and Sam we're using it I
really like it it's a very thick cream
and it almost looks matte on the skin
like it doesn't have a very high shine
which I enjoy especially for Sam if he's
gonna put it on in the daytime and not
only nighttime it doesn't look like
really greasy but it still gives him a
lot of moisture because I said like a
million times he's a super dry human so
yeah I've really been enjoying those and
then last from Bioderma I did pick up
another one of the sensi bio
eyes this is an eye lotion this is a
live gel eye cream eye cream and this is
one of my favorites I've gone through
like three this will be my third tube I
think but I just love it it's very
lightweight it's not going to do
anything too much for you but I don't
feel like it gets into my eyes it
doesn't make my eyes feel like there's a
film on them it moisturizes without
causing any like- like or adverse things
I don't get any Millia by my eyes so I
really do like this when we were in a
grocery store I decided to go a little
ham and picked up a couple of things we
were staying in Airbnb so we had access
to having like a fridge and having a
stove and different things so we could
cook food which is really nice because
we were there three weeks and different
places we stayed different amount of
times but sometimes we were at places
for like four or five days and it was
nice to be able to make ourselves
breakfast or make ourselves a snack or a
dinner or something like that if we
didn't want to eat out it just kind of
made it feel a little bit more homey and
not so much just travelers I'm gonna
leave actually Sam's Airbnb code down
below if you've never tried Airbnb this
is a sponsored it's a code I think
anyone can get a code if you sign up but
if you were planning to take a vacation
I highly suggest just checking out
Airbnb seeing the options I feel like
you can get things that are a reasonable
price and you get more space it's just
it's definitely different than a hotel
if you love hotels and what they have to
offer
maybe Airbnb wouldn't be for you but if
you're looking for something that is
just more personal and more of like yeah
someone's house a different experience
if you don't want to just like have a
room in the Hilton or something I highly
suggest
Airbnb out they have things on all
different price scales too so yeah it
was it was really fun and really awesome
but anyway we went to the grocery store
because we were getting groceries for
the house and I picked up a few things
these are all lip balms because I'm
crazy I think this is actually the
grocery stores brand of lip balm so this
is okay I didn't know what these are
gonna be like inside this kind of
reminds me of the well oh one that I've
gotten in the past when I was in France
so it's okay doesn't have a scent or
anything and then the other two I picked
up are from the brand lobello
and these reminded me of the Nivea ones
I love the packaging of these like I
love that thicker tube so I picked up a
hydrating one and this is nice it's like
more like almost like a really light
vanilla like a fresh vanilla so I enjoy
that and then this is the one that I
loved the most out of all of them I like
these ones better than the other one I
picked up this is the soft rose and it
does have a color to it but it's very
very light and you honestly really don't
see it much on the lips it's so faint
but it's just perfect so I love this
this is like a really exciting pickup
for me so if you happen to see it and
that sounds like something you'd like I
do suggest the soft rose lip balm and
then at the grocery store I picked up
another eye cream from the coop brand
yeah coop I think is the drugstore or
grocery store that it was come on anyway
so this is it it's it's very similar to
the Bioderma one and it was only like
five euro and I just thought that was
such a cheap price they had a lot of
cheap skincare and I just I love
inexpensive skincare and beauty items
it's just kind of my thing so I wanted
to pick it up it's very thin but
moisturizing so I'm excited to have
another like eye cream on hand it smells
just like you know nothing really so
yeah that was just like an extra thing I
kind of just whipped into the cart and
then I think the last thing I got at the
grocery store this is a rose I think
toner I'm not sure cuz it's all in
Italian but I used my Google Translate
to try to read some of the words and
know what this was I can't tell if it's
like rose water or a rose toner
but it just smells like rose so yeah if
you know exactly what this is that would
be really awesome if you could tell me
thanks
I only have two things left for the
beauty stuff so in other pharmacies I
picked up a toothpaste this one is the
Marvis classic strong mint toothpaste I
picked this up because I've seen this a
lot I used to work at a beauty store
where we sold this all the time people
would come in and buy so much of this
toothpaste they also sell this on
Sephora and it was a way better deal to
get it in store I think I paid 350 or
450 for this and I think it's like ten
dollars for it even smaller one here in
the States at Sephora so I'm really
happy about that it's also an Italian
brand so that worked out and then I did
pick up something from Kota Lee and this
is a perfume it's the fig Devine perfume
and this smells really really nice I
love that it isn't overly sweet it
definitely has a fig scent I really like
almost like this in-between of like
unisex perfumes and I love fixed-end so
this one's really nice and I really love
this size I think sometimes I really
want a big size of perfumes to like last
forever and if it's a scent I truly love
and I've used multiple of them up and
yeah that makes sense but when it's
something like this and I might not want
to use it for forever it's nice to be
able to get through it without it like
lasting your whole life you know and
that was also cheaper to get in store
than it was if I were to buy it here so
that worked out oh my gosh that
maybelline super ink these things really
suck they really do matte inks actually
while they dry okay so that's everything
for the beauty portion of the haul and
now I'm gonna show you guys some of the
souvenirs we picked up me and Sam don't
get a ton of souvenirs I feel like
although I feel like it's a lot to show
you but I was there almost a month and
we were in a four separate city so that
also was like a big thing about it but
we like to get ornaments we like to get
coins and I did pick up some pins as
well so those are kind of the the pieces
that we like to collect when we're away
and then I have some just like food and
different things I also have a couple
art things as well so yeah we'll just
get into it I know this is like a long
video sorry
so the first ornament I have here that
I'm like trying to rip open this is
something that we got in Florence oh no
this is something we got in Venice it's
like Venetian glass but this is the
ornament we picked up it's really
beautiful and it has all these little
pieces in it like you can only see my
armpit but it has all these beautiful
pieces of glass in it and it's so
beautiful I think it's gonna reflect the
light really well on the Christmas tree
you guys know how much I love my
Christmas tree so yeah I'm really happy
we picked this one up and it wasn't too
expensive I think it was like 14 euro
who approved this formula seriously like
crazy
you have to be crazy to approve this
formula we're just gonna try to make it
through the video I'm so sorry if it
looks disgusting another ornament that I
picked up in Venice this one is a
smaller one and not something that I
thought of really the trip like I don't
really like to get Christmas ornaments
like Christmasy themed ones necessarily
like I'd rather my tree look more
eclectic it doesn't have to be like
Santa on a gondola you know what I mean
they have a lot of these like glass
balloons all around so that's what I
picked up and I picked up a little pink
one I really really really really wanted
to pick up like a bunch of these glass
balloons and have them like all around
like as a light fixture type of thing
but I wasn't rich enough for that next
time right next time so yeah I picked up
a pink balloon okay I had to get up and
get my vatican ornament cuz it wasn't
over here also I powdered my lip so
there different color that's why but I
got a ornament at the Vatican this is
the first one I picked up and it was
really expensive but I thought it was
just so beautiful
and it was just like the number one one
I wanted so feel like the bow is looking
so janky already though anyway this is
what it looks like it's so pretty and it
has like these gold outlines and they're
Saint Peter's Basilica it's like just
beautiful so this one I thought would
look really really nice on the tree and
I'm really happy I picked that one up
and I did pick up one other ornament
I think I left it somewhere it was like
this cute little fish I got in Sorrento
it was like from an artisan there and it
was only like five year old luckily it
wasn't super expensive but I'm so sad I
don't have it but I cannot find it next
I'll show you guys some of the arts that
I picked up I guess or that I wanted to
like hang on my wall this is from San
Clemente Basilica San Clemente and it's
just a picture of Jesus but it's like
the mosaic version from the church so I
thought that was really cool and it was
like one of the first ones we went into
we went into like a million churches
it's kind of what you do when you go to
Europe so when it comes to other art I
picked this one up in Positano when we
were on the coast and it's so pretty I'm
really happy with it
this is it and it's just like a little
picture of the buildings and everything
but in this like pastel color scheme
it's super beautiful and I really really
like it so I can't wait to get this
framed and hung on my wall and then the
last one here is a watercolor of the
Trevi Fountain in Rome which is one of
my all-time favorite places in Rome Rome
is my favorite city I think ever I don't
know I love it so much I mean I love LA
but out of all the places I've traveled
and when it comes to like city
I think Rome's my favorite I loved it
the first time I was there and I loved
it when I was there this time and out of
all the places it's just my favorite so
yeah I wanted to pick up this one I
really liked the color scheme as well
with like the blues and the purples so
yeah I have a watercolor of the Trevi
Fountain now let's talk about some coins
I picked up quite a few coins at
different places we've done this before
when we were in Paris when we got
engaged we picked up a ton of coins and
just basically overall in our lives
together me and Sam have been really
into collecting like smashed pennies and
different things like that so whenever
we went to a place that was like we were
able to get a coin we basically did so
the first one I have here this one is
the Basilica San Marco and that's in
Venice it's absolutely beautiful if you
ever get the chance to go I highly
suggest it the ceilings are like all
gold it's like
so really really cool this is one we got
in Positano from a church when we were
in Florence we did a day trip to Pisa so
we picked up a Pisa one and then they
also had a smashed penny but it was a
five cent euro so we got one of those of
the Leaning Tower of Pisa when we were
in Rome we went to the Pantheon so this
is that and it shows you the oculus
which that dome is absolutely beautiful
and amazing like it's crazy I love Rome
and then when we were down in Sorrento
we also went to Pompeii and so we got a
coin there obviously this is a replica
but this one's really cool because it's
like you know an old replica of the
coins they used so those are the coins I
picked up and honestly that's like
sparked this whole like coin collection
thing that me and Sam are really into
right now so that's kind of exciting in
this fun new hobby that we've started
and you know we've already been starting
but are deciding to get like more into
and that's really fun they picked up a
few different pins from the different
cities we were in in Venice I picked up
this little gondola guy super cute I got
this one that just says Italia and it
has the Italian flag and a shield really
cool this one I got on our day trip to
Positano which is on the Alma fee coast
I got two different ones when we went to
Pisa this is the like symbol of Pisa and
on the flag and then this is the Leaning
Tower of Pisa and then I picked up two
at the Vatican so yeah those are the
pins I picked up I'm really excited to
add those to my collection if you guys
don't know I collect pins and I'm going
to be doing a video at some point I have
all the material I'm just so lazy and
haven't made it yet but I'm showing you
I'm gonna make like a banner to show all
my pins cuz I have some from Disneyland
in just different places I've been and
whatnot so yeah that will be coming at
some point last thing we did pick up
some holy water this is filled with
water from Saint Peter's Basilica in the
Vatican
so yeah the rest of the stuff have to
show you is all just like food stuff and
some of it is gifts and some of it's
stuff we bought for ourselves Sam made
me pick him up some of these candies
these are like citrus and orange candies
though there's lemon and orange they're
like the rinds and
everything I got these when we were in
Positano but basically all up and down
the coast if you're in Capri or Sorrento
or Positano like lemons are like a huge
staple in like this the countryside so
yeah you'll see lemon stuff everywhere
we also got some lemon candies in
Positano and then we also brought home
some lemon cello this one's from
Sorrento and then this one we actually
got for a friends they like requested it
and this is from Capri so yeah we got
those and some gifts in for ourselves
when we went on a walking tour in
Sorrento it was really cool and we ended
up going to this farm and looking out on
the whole city and we had to hike up
this whole thing it it was kind of a lot
but the farm had some marmalade that
they had made so this is lemon marmalade
we picked up a couple of these and then
they also had some olive oil that they
had made and it's really cool they
explained how like the olive trees
protect the lemon trees and all of that
is really cool how they use you know the
landscape and what they're given when it
comes to like the environment and how
they farm it and everything anyway oh we
got some extra virgin olive oil and I
think this is the last thing I want to
show which this isn't that big of a deal
it's just a Bellini and we picked this
up at the grocery store but we didn't
drink it and so we brought it home with
us and that's everything for this haul
it's so long thank you so much if you
stayed till the end I know it was a long
one I know I've talked a lot about Italy
but it was a long a lot of my life like
I feel like a whole you know one twelfth
of my year was spent there essentially
so hope you know it's no wonder that it
is taking up a lot of my time as well as
I feel just traveling in general
especially when you go to a different
country just you know it broadens your
horizons and it just changes you and
