Lauren this is probably one of the more
exciting videos I filmed this year this
is going to be yet another declutter
video I am preparing to do a collection
series this year and I was thinking
about it and I thought okay I'm gonna go
through one last time
not one last time I'll probably go
through again but I wanted to go through
and just to clutter some items that as I
was going to be doing those collection
videos that I just wouldn't feel proud
to have in my collection or would just
be something that I'm like oh I just
have this I don't use it it's okay but
yeah I have it I just didn't want to
have as many of those items obviously I
probably still will it's a process
people but to declutter your makeup to
declutter anything that means a lot to
you so I definitely feel like out of all
the declutter I put on my channel from
the very beginning until now this is the
best declutter I've done the most real
I've been with myself and I'm really
proud of this declutter there are some
really big items in here that I was not
expecting to get rid of and that yeah
I'm really proud that I'm getting rid of
so I just wanted to say at the beginning
here too if you are trying to declutter
your makeup you know just no but it's a
process and it's hard to let go
sometimes at first but the more you
declutter the more you are able to just
let go of things or realize that you
haven't you know use things or that
you're not going to use things I also
think project panning is a great way to
really get to know your collection and
if you have to use a pallet for you know
a month straight and you end up painting
that palette it kind of puts it into
perspective like why do I even have this
let's get rid of it so that I can be
using the things that I truly do love
last I think I wanted to just say
besides declutter
my collection series I also am wanting
to get two new palettes
that aren't out yet but I know that I'm
going to want them when they do come out
they're from Too Faced and I want the
sweet peach palette and I want the
peanut butter and jelly palette I do I
want them and so I kept that in mind as
I declared this time because I was like
I really want those so what are things I
could give up to have this in my
collection anyway let's get into it
sorry for the long intro let's go I'm
just gonna start off big and show you
the two biggest things
feel like I'm getting rid of in this you
know declutter our video the first thing
here this is the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette as you can see I've
really never used this these are super
soft shadows and they all have the
embossing still on them so I just have
never used this I don't think these are
matte shadows and I honestly just have
other colors in my collection that are
similar to this that I would reach for
over this and I obviously have reached
for over this so I'm going to pass it on
and give it to a friend or someone who
will actually use it because I just
haven't and honestly I have so many
palettes I would rather use them instead
of this like I don't want to sit here
and pan this so I'm going to pass it on
I'm gonna pass it on I'm so proud of
myself also real quick I am going to be
giving all of this stuff to friends as
long as it is like not bad or spoiled in
any way so these will be going to a nice
home they're not going to just be thrown
in the trash for no reason this is the
other palette that I'm going to be
getting rid of this is the NARS
narcissist palette this is one of the
palettes I was considering panning this
year and I've used it a couple times I
was using this shade to set my primer
for a while because I had hit pan on the
one I was using and I just don't like
the shadows in here
I'm not drawn to this palette I like fun
colors obviously look at my brows and
these are just boring this is like the
most boring palette to me if you really
like neutrals and you want something
quick and easy everyday this probably
would be good but I just don't think the
quality is that great like I don't think
that anything about this palette should
retail for $75 or $79 however crazy
expensive it is I bought this because of
the hype and I shouldn't have and I
regret it and now it is going to find a
home or someone can love it and use it
but that's definitely not me and again I
would rather like you shadows out of my
Kat Von D maybe to loca remix palette
like that's so much more me than this is
so I am passing this along and just you
know coming to the realization that it's
gone and just coming to the realization
that I don't want to use this and that's
okay and although with text I spend the
money on this like life's too short we
got to get rid of it then you know and
honestly with these things sometimes
it's hard to get rid of like higher-end
stuff but if the money's already spent
it's already done
like the deed is done the only thing you
can do is like change
the future and you know we gotta let go
of the baggage so I'm trying it's still
a process but I'm trying another little
eyeshadow palette I'm getting rid of
this is from Urban Decay this was a
500-point perk and it just has four
shadows in it I'm just not going to like
reach for this so I'm just going to get
rid of it and again declutter some of
the shadows in my collection I'm getting
rid of every single one of these Sephora
single eyeshadows that I have these were
in a duo
they're called duo reflex I have every
single color from the collection and if
you ever saw that video I did a whole
like swatch video and review video on
these you were like an OG subscriber
that was like early last year but I
really wanted these and I you know it's
just proof that even when you're trying
to project pan it's a process because I
bought these when I was still trying to
project pan I thought I was being good
and I don't need any of these I don't
think these are that great I'd rather
have other type of duochrome shadows and
it's just a bunch of singles I am just
hoarding and not using so I will be
passing these along there are so many
I'm not gonna go through the names you
can watch that video if you want I'll
link it down below I just don't need
them and again coming to the realization
that I shouldn't just hold on to these
because I bought them a year ago another
big epiphany I had as I was d cluttering
my collection was with my cream blushes
I don't use cream blushes I used to only
use cream blushes but I don't anymore
and so I decided to get rid of every
single one I had except for the new
steel a watercolor one I don't have any
but that one now so I'm going to be
adding rid of this one from Stila
it's like a convertible color palette
I've never used this I've only so
watched it and I don't realistically I
just don't I don't want to use it look I
don't want to use it so I'm gonna get
rid of that the last little guy he
survived so long through idak letters
but he's gone this is the tarte exposed
cheek stain and again I just I don't
want to sit here and panic I don't want
to you and again life's too short I'm
gonna get rid of it and just know that I
should never buy cream blush again ever
again so I'm getting rid of that and
then the last you hear from Stila as
well these are other convertible colors
but they're just minis this is peony and
this is a lilium I've had these for
forever I did want to use these up in
2016 but I just was thinking about it
and it's like
I don't even want to use them up I just
want to get rid of them so I'm gonna
cross them off that list and I kinda
feel like it worked out either way like
they're not gonna be a part of my
collection going forward so although I
didn't use it up
I made the hard decision instead to get
rid of them so I am happy with that more
blushes but these are powder blushes
again I feel really proud of myself
blushes and eyeshadows those are my
thing like I love them so it's really
hard for me but I'm getting rid of this
cheek palette from lorac I have used
this one time ever they're super
pigmented they're kind of hard to use
because they're so pigmented I just
don't gravitate to colors like this I
bought this because it came out because
it was a new from lorac and I love lorac
but I just don't use this and I don't
again want to use it I'd rather use
Tarte blushes I have I have so many
blushes and I really just want to use
the ones I want to use and not feel
guilty about letting this sit so because
I just have never touched it it needs to
go and I'm gonna pass it on to a friend
I'm sure someone will love this and then
I decided to get rid of the two Milani
blushes that I have I do have romantic
rose I love that color and then I
decided to get these ones too but I
really only use the romantic rose I
don't use these so this is Bella Rose so
I'm gonna be getting rid of that and I
think I've only used that one once and
then this one is warm petals and I have
never used this I've only ever swatched
it and I just again I've had it for a
long time to not ever use it definitely
over a year and so it needs to go I have
a ton of mascaras here from by Tier II I
got these from work and um I didn't ever
use them on my eyes I just use them in
my brows and they're a little too dark
to use in my brows I like a brighter
brow something that's a little bit
lighter more pastel that's more what I'm
drawn to and because these are meant to
be on the eyelashes they give definition
so they're like colors but they're
darker tones of those colors and they
just don't work so I have number four
number three and then number seven which
is mystic orchid that's the only one
with like a name I have to number
Seven's mystic mystic orchid so I'm
gonna get rid of these and just not have
them there's no reason to have them I'm
not using them that I don't want to
hoard them so I'm gonna get rid of them
these are gonna go in the trash though
because I probably shouldn't have taken
them from work
I have a brow powder here this is from
vincent longo and it has a powder and
then a wax I've never used it I don't
want to use it so I'm gonna get rid of
it I have two nail polishes that I'm
getting rid of this one is from OPI this
is in the color metallic for life I just
don't ever use it it too black with like
silver sparkles in it it is pretty but
I've never used it and I don't feel like
I will want to use it this one here is
by the brand habit and it is in the
color Nefertiti Nefertiti never tidy
it's like a goddess right I think so
anyway I don't think I'll ever use this
again
I like color I like fun stuff and so I
don't usually go nude I just usually
don't so I have never used this and I'm
not going to so I'm going to pass it I
mostly just have like rando stuff left
and then like a billion lip products I
decided to get really true with myself
with my lip products one it takes me
forever to use up a lip product me
especially I don't like I'm not a lip
product girl I like liquid matte
lipsticks I like pen type of lip
products but other than that I just
don't use regular lipsticks I just don't
so I really cut down my collection of
just regular lipsticks to a more minimum
even more minimum than I felt like I was
before and I'm sure I could do it again
but this is where I'm at now so let's
get through it
this is a Maybelline lipstick this is in
the color pink pleasure and getting rid
of that I'm getting rid of this vivid
lipstick from Maybelline in the color
electric orange this is one from I
believe the rebel blooms collection this
is in orchid ecstasy I'm getting rid of
that and then I think last for
Maybelline this is the nude lust color I
don't know it's from like the nude line
I'm getting rid of that one of the like
things I was thinking about when I was
getting rid of these lip products was
I'd like a matte lip if I'm gonna do a
color and then if not I like like more
bombs or something more sheer if it's
gonna be like a nude so if you didn't
fall into those categories I tried to
eliminate it from my collection we know
how I feel about baby lips I'm getting
rid of these these two are both from the
doctor rescue line and I just don't like
that like medicated
I just don't enjoy that so now I'm down
to I only have two left in my collection
now that I'm getting rid of these two
and these are in the color coral crave
and just PG I'm getting rid of this lip
gloss this is from Dior and it is in the
color 886 flash it's beautiful I just
don't like glosses I've had this a
really long time and I've just felt
guilty to get rid of it because it was a
gift and it's expensive
but honestly if I'm being true I don't
want to use this and I just don't like
glosses so I'm gonna get rid of it I
know it's sad but I'm getting rid of it
I have a few wet and wild lipsticks this
one here if you can see that really
pretty deep purpley fuchsia color this
is Ferguson Crest Cabernet I'm just not
gonna use it it's a glossy color I just
want matte so and then I'm getting rid
of these too like white and wild I think
they were like I don't know what the
ones these are called like the line is
but these two and one is in ninety one
ninety one ninety and this one's in 960
they're both like deep dark purple e
type of shades one of them is actually
broken like this part comes off of it
and it's not supposed to and the other
one I just haven't used so I'm just
gonna pass them a work throw them I
don't know yet
they're kind of old so yeah getting rid
of those this is a high-end product in
getting rid of this is the tarte elite
lip surgence I just don't want to wear
this so I don't want to have to work
through it I'm just gonna get rid of it
and pass it along this is a little mini
lipstick for Marc Jacobs it's in a red
color and it's called so Rouge that is
what it looks like I just don't wear
really red lipsticks and if I did again
if you probably a liquid lipstick so I'm
gonna get rid of it this actually is one
my favorite colors of lipstick but I
haven't worn it in a while and again I'd
rather have this color in a different
formula and this is from Max Factor in
the color 56 I can't remember the name
of this but I'm getting rid of it
obviously everything I'm getting rid of
this is a covergirl lipstick in the
colour smitten pretty but again I'd
rather have this and I'm formula it's
not gonna move on my lip so this is a
lipstick from sleek this is in the color
mulberry and a pretty dark color but it
just moves around
so it needs to go and then I'm getting
rid of I believe the last one of my
Revlon lip butters I think I'm done with
them after this one and this is in the
color juicy papaya if you want to look
what it looks like that's what it looks
like I just don't like these I've talked
about that in the products I regret I'm
video they're just not my favorite
formula so I'm getting rid of it we are
kind of almost done here so this is
something I'm actually throwing away
because it went bad and that's why I'm
declutter in it this is from josie maran
and this is the argon illuminator I do
really think this is a beautiful product
but it smells like crayons and
definitely is bad so it needs to go in
the trash this is from Burt's Bees it's
a cuticle cream and it is just so bad
I've had this for forever and it smells
bad it just doesn't smell good I
wouldn't say it stinks but it just
smells like crayons so I'm going to be
throwing that away as well this is
something I don't know if I'm gonna pass
on it just smells disgusting this is
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's a snowman
pop antibacterial hand gel this smells
so gross I was doing my husband's makeup
I have a picture of it on my Instagram
which is like a pop-art zombie I did
really fast on him it just smells like
cookie or something stick and he made me
wash my hands with like a different
product because he hated the smell list
about and it just it's just a very
off-putting scent to me personally so I
might see if someone at school wants
this but there's no way you could do a
client's makeup with this because they
would just like want to stab you so Sam
definitely wanted to stab me it just
smells really gross to me okay these are
the most random and I'll just do a
couple of them I have some lash cards
here I'm just gonna get rid of them I've
had them for a long time because so many
people like these and whatever but I
just don't reach for them in my everyday
life and I just don't want the clutter
so I'm getting rid of those this is
something I got in a nip see a long time
ago it's like an eyeliner tattoo type of
thing I don't even know I'm just gonna
do my eyeliner if I want it like that so
getting rid of that I just think this is
kind of gimmicky and weird I have some
nail files these are kind of cute but uh
you just peel them off and stuff I just
don't I mean I don't even paint my nails
let alone file them so I'm getting rid
of it some toe separators I'm getting
rid of this is a little brush I'm
getting
I didn't like go through all my brushes
I just don't need this little Bend 9:1
and last I'm getting rid of this cute
flash tattoo in the word love I don't
want to use it so yeah that's everything
kind of weird stuff at the end sorry but
I am declaring it so I hope you guys

amazing declutter I really hope it

harder items we all know what those are
