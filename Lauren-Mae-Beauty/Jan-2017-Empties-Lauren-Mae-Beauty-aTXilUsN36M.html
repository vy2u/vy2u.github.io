is going to be my January empties these
are all products I used up well in
January and February
okay the sake of the title will call it
January empties we're just gonna get
straight into it because it's kind of a
lot of products and we don't need an
intro we know what an empties video is
right great we'll start off with makeup
I finished a lip product guys I'm so
happy I am so happy about this this is
the Tarte exposed lip surgence which
they don't make anymore they have like
their lingerie ones I didn't dig it out
but it does not twist up anymore and it
is flat with a container this is in
multiple projects last year and I'm so
glad to get it done I did really enjoy
this color I'm not saying I would never
repurchase these but I really do like my
buxom ones better than this so if I was
going to spend the money I probably
would try a new shade of that then get
this again these are some items that I
actually didn't use up but they're dried
out and I can't use any more these are
the Sephora litter eyeliners and they
were in like a limited edition set so I
got these a long time ago the wand is
just is done for it's like totally
sprayed out what do I call that this
one's like crazy I mean yeah it's done
for so I'm really sad about that it
really did like these for the inner
corner it makes putting glitter on so
much easier and such an everyday thing
I'm definitely gonna look into the next
liners I feel like those are like the
next best thing or the urban decay ones
but those are more expensive and they
also are more of like a chunky glitter
they're not as finely milled as that
glitter was I don't know I just need to
find a replacement and last for makeup I
have the elf brow pencil in taupe you
guys know it's my favorite doesn't twist
up anymore this is probably the like
fourth or fifth one I've been through I
love it I just think it's so good highly
suggest it for the price it's amazing
now we'll get into the basket just
randomly I have a lot of hair products
this year this year I have a lot of hair
products this month I don't know why I
they just kind of all got done at the
same time so the first thing I have here
the bottles all distorted this is the
living proof frizz shampoo this is not
the right shampoo from a hair type I
have fine thin hair I don't really have
a lot of fruit I mean
it looks like I have a lot of friends
these are speakers I don't need
something heavy and conditioning that
would be fighting frizz I use this as my
first cleanse I don't take a shower
every day and I don't wash my hair every
day so when I do wash my hair I like to
wash it through a couple of times so
this is why I first rinse and I felt
like the volumizing shampoo I used
afterward could actually do the job it
was supposed to so I mean I liked it for
that I would never repurchase it but it
worked out for me I found a way to make
it work and use it up and enjoy it the
volumizing shampoo I was using with that
is the Moroccan oil extra volume shampoo
first off the smell of this and the
conditioner is just the best it smells
so good I remember what I used to work
at my old store so many people would be
like it smells so good and I kinda was
just like okay okay we get it
it smells good but I am one of those
people now I think this smells
absolutely amazing I really enjoyed this
definitely would repurchase my mom sent
me these so thank you mom and I really
did enjoy them I thought they worked
really well they gave me volume this
definitely did tangle my hair I find the
most volumizing shampoos tangle my hair
I don't know I remember hair is just
like sensitive and likes to like be
tangled I don't know so I don't really
count that against volumizing shampoos
because I've honestly never had one
that's giving me volume and hasn't done
that so I just feel like it's it just
comes with the territory but I really
did enjoy that one I also really enjoyed
the conditioner that came with it so I
have that in my shower still because I
go through shampoo faster than
conditioner I'm like the opposite of
most people but together they worked
really nice and I definitely suggest it
if you were looking into it and I think
that they're really good I would
repurchase I think the last shampoo in
here is the Bosley nourishing shampoo
this is the one Sam uses this is to help
stimulate hair growth and like not lose
hair this works nice it has like a minty
smell and it kind of tingles your head
when you use it we're using Nioxin now
and we'll probably stick to Nioxin I
don't know why we switched to Nioxin but
we did so yeah and just keeping on with
the hair trend these are dry shampoos I
have my beloved batiste we went through
- Sam started using batiste now so I
feel like I'm gonna go through it even
faster than before I'm so happy that
easy
which is like the weirdest thing to be
happy about but I remember being like
hey let me use dry shampoo on your hair
like I'm telling you it'll be great
you'll like you'll really like it your
hair will be so much better and like
fresher blah blah blah and he finally
let me start doing it a little bit and
he finally has started to like kind of
branch out and try stuff and he uses it
all the time and he loves it so I feel
so good about that I don't know why that
makes me just so satisfied inside but it
does the other dry shampoo though that I
had was this chlorine dry shampoo I got
this from my friend and it wasn't all
the way full so I do have a ton left of
it but I really do like this dry shampoo
I think it works really well it does
leave a bit of a white cast kind of like
the batiste though for me it's not a big
deal this is just more expensive so I
don't suggest it in that way but if you
can get this on a good deal I definitely
think it's nice I think this is a good
one this is like definitely second
runner-up out of dry shampoos that I've
tried I have a few kit things this is
91% alcohol you guys know that I use
this in my kit the reason I use 91%
alcohol is because I use alcohol
palettes sometimes so it works for
sanitation but it also works on my
alcohol palettes and it's just nice to
have one option instead of having
multiple options with like 70% so it
just works out the other empty I have is
the face secrets professional cosmetic
wedges these are where using my kit for
disposable sponges I really like using
sponges specifically to like pack powder
on if someone's looking shiny while
we're filming them or whatever it's just
easy to pack it on and then I'll bring a
brush just like buff out if I need to
anyway their sponge it's not that big of
a deal this is kind of a weird empty
this is the formula it's delete all nail
polish remover how you use this as you
put your fingers in the holes and like
move them around it's must be kind of
like magic this actually works really
well I got this sent to me an influencer
box with the topcoat and the base coat
and the like cleanser which I love all
three of those I've been using them
every time I paint my nails and I'm like
on a kick with painting my nails I'm so
happy I basically loved everything in
that box I think formula X is a really
great nail polish line I know they're
being discontinued I think in support
which is really sad I don't know why I
think they're really good but
this is really awesome and it worked
really well I don't know if I'd go ahead
and repurchase it if I got it for a
really good deal maybe I'm just fine
with doing it normal but if you like
this type of thing it definitely worked
so that's like a positive because I
thought it was just gonna be kind of
like some gimmicky thing this is a
little hair item I forgot to mention
this is the BB full potential
booster hair spray I've had these in the
last couple of empties this is just a
spray that's supposed to help keep your
keep your hair in your head so I was
trying to get through them I had a lot
of little samples and I was just trying
to use them up instead of letting them
go to waste since I did take them from
my work with the intention of using them
and I wanted to make sure I wasn't
taking away the potential of someone
else using them for my own sake and then
letting them go to waste you know and I
didn't I'm proud of myself some teeth
stuff I'd have two of the Colgate optic
white and this is in sparkling white
they're both in sparkling white I get
mine at Costco and I really like them I
actually need to go and repurchase them
because we're out moving on this is the
reach mint waxed floss you guys have
seen that every empties we go through
one usually a month some skin care items
I have this Roe DL Dragon's Blood
sculpting gel I do really like this the
smell of this is really nice every time
I'd wear this to bed seems like you're
wearing the dragon's blood I'm like yeah
you know this is one of those products
that you like pump here product comes
out but I always find I have to like
twist off the cap but I always try to
have to twist off the cap and get into
the base and stuff just to clean it out
and get all the product out of it I got
this when they were selling at Costco
for like twenty seven dollars which i
think is a great price and I would
repurchase it for that price but I
definitely would not repurchase this for
the like 98 dollars that it sells for I
think that's way too pricy for what it
does I just think there are other
products out there that do a similar
thing and feel a similar way and you
don't need to spend that much but that
moisturizer also tends to make primers
ball up so I only used it at night so I
mean if it was not a good deal I
definitely get it again I think it's a
good product but I don't think it's
worth a hundred dollars the other
moisturizer me and Sam we're using on
our face was this Cetaphil moisturizing
cream now this says for body but we use
on their face and it works great I love
it it feels really soft and smooth Sam
is
super dry oh that's what it looks like
this is just a small one we have a huge
tub now but Sam is super dry and he just
needs more moisture and this works
really well it's inexpensive for how
much you get and I just like the way it
feels on my skin so I like it if you
wanted to branch out I suggest a
Cetaphil it's really great last for skin
care are just my fel wipes you guys know
I love these I have two of the aloe vera
one of the green tea I definitely like
the aloe vera the best I'll just show
you guys I have this one here I don't
know what this it just is facial
cleansing I don't like the ones in the
white packaging they're just very
perfumed so they're not my favorite but
they're like out those big Lots I go to
so I need to like scope out some other
big lots and see what's going on I have
two hand soaps this one is the sweet
cinnamon pumpkin now I didn't really
smell the cinnamon on this I'm not a
cinnamon person I like it in like a
cinnamon roll but it just definitely has
to be cut with something sweet and this
was cut with enough sweetness that I
really enjoyed it I thought it smelt
fresh and good I didn't smell too much
like a bakery item it just felt really
good so I would definitely repurchase
this which is surprising to me I think I
bought that online so I didn't smell it
before I got it and I really didn't
enjoy it I thought it smelled great the
other hand stuff I have here is from
Kroger and this is the winter garland
liquid hand soap they come out with
these hand soaps like every season it's
not really good - this is more fresh and
kind of like a Christmas tree type of
scent I thought this felt really good
and I would repurchase it again if they
sold it again or whatever if I could
find it but I'm not gonna like go online
or something psycho and the last item I
have to share with you guys is the
exotic coconut shower gel from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works obviously this is pretty old
it's in super old packaging I really
liked the smell of this this was a
coconut scent but it had kind of this um
I don't know I almost felt like the husk
of the coconut - like that dirty part of
the coconut
I don't explode like it kind of had like
a dirt scent - I know that sounds not
very good but it was just kind of a
refreshing coconut scent instead of
super sickly sweet I'm always down for a
good coconut scent so I really enjoyed
this it just felt more natural kind of
like the bodyshop coconut senses if you
smelled those so I personally really
liked about the body work shower gels I
have a ton
and I continue to repurchase them
because I think they work really nice
okay those are all my empties guys I
hope you enjoyed this video and I will
see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
