Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm gonna be doing an empties
video and I'm actually filming this in
real time so I think I'm gonna film it
and upload it today so hi everyone
happy Monday I hope you're having an
amazing day I do not only want to film
tonight but I went through and kind of
declutter some of my stuff which will be
the video you see tomorrow
and I was just like no Oren just do it I
was on set all weekend long and it was
really awesome it's for a music video or
like a series of music videos by sorrow
like sar oh I know it sounded like it
said Izzy but sorrow I'm gonna leave a
link to his Spotify as well as like some
of his music because not only did I work
on the music videos but uh the songs are
really good I really like vapor it's
probably my favorite one but anyway I
just thought I would share that because
I've been listening to it a lot this
whole weekend and anyway I just wanted
to chat with you guys also at the
beginning of this well I just get into
the empties oh I'm gonna start with
makeup because that's the most exciting
and then we'll move into the other
products that I've used up I'm also
gonna leave the empties playlist linked
down below if you guys want to check
that out and let's just get into it I
have a decent amount of empties this
month I'm really proud of that I had a
couple things just on the verge so the
first thing here this is the pro touch
setting powder from kiss and this is
just a loose translucent powder it was
nice I enjoyed it this changed how I do
my foundation and just kind of base
routine because now I really do like to
use a loose setting powder instead of
something pressed I just like the way it
looks on the skin better so I'm really
happy to have used this up I don't know
what this retails for because I did get
this sent to me but I enjoyed it and I
would try this again but I probably will
try out other things because I feel like
it's easier to get than this brand I did
use up another powder as well this was
in my how to press a powder video this
is also in my year-long project pan so
I'm kind of giving you a spoiler I
normally don't do that but I'm just
really happy this is gone and I thought
I would share it so you know nothing in
the pan it's used up this is the Revlon
nearly naked powder in fair and I
believe this is discontinued I do like
the packaging though there's something
about this like nice of white packaging
but other than that
Justin okay powder and I'm glad I'm done
with it another base product that I have
this is the Sephora airbrush foundation
I have mine in fair
I enjoyed this foundation and I think it
looks nice on the skin I wish they had a
few more color options because this
one's a little bit too light for me but
the next shade down is just not quite
the right color either the biggest thing
that is a plus for this is just the
finish on the skin I don't necessarily
like that it's an airbrush because I
don't use the airbrush function for
application so I it's just kind of like
I wish I was just in a bottle or
something overall I don't think I would
repurchase this just for the price and
all the other things I just think there
are other foundations out there that are
better or the same so I don't know if
I'd go for this again this is something
that I'm throwing in my empties but it's
not quite empty I mostly just repackage
this product this is the Milani make it
last setting spray I've talked about in
many videos how I felt like I got a bad
sprayer because it kind of just shot in
a line but you guys let me know in the
comments that that is a normal thing
that a lot of you guys have experienced
that so I think there is something
faulty with this packaging it's very odd
to me that all the youtubers who have
raved about this all got good sprayers
or maybe they just overlooked that I've
heard so many rave reviews about this
before I purchased it I do like the
smell I like the product itself it's
just the packaging that's a Miss for me
I don't know if I would repurchase this
product because of that I just think
that's like really irritating and like
you can't even really take off the lid
so I had to spray this into another
container
maybe I just couldn't take the lid off
and I'm the only one but it was I tried
it I was gonna break my nails off at
this point I probably would just try
other things because this is a ten
dollar spray last two makeup empties I
have my ELF brow pencil in taupe you
guys know that I love this thing I
really want to try the newer brow pencil
from them that's $5 and I believe that
one is a bit slimmer so that's what I
want to try next but I have back up to
this I've used a million of these a pile
of them and then last year is a mascara
from ciate London and this is the Wonder
wand mascara this is something that I
thought was just okay and then I brought
it to Arizona with me
was really just using it over and over
and getting a feel for it and I really
liked the way it made my lashes look but
this product flakes all over the place
throughout the day all that mascara just
comes off your face onto the bottom of
your eyes and I mean you have no mascara
left on your eyelashes by the end of the
day it's just not a good mascara for me
it just did not work out at all which is
sad because I truly did like the way it
looked when I first applied and now on
to the big pink bucket of stuff I will
start off with wipes just because
they're easy these are my favorite wipes
from fel I have the I think these are
the green tea ones and these are the
aloe vera I use these in my kit and I do
enjoy a face wipe although I have been
way better this month about using a
regular light cleanser when I go to bed
instead of just wipes so it's progress I
will take it I have a shower gel that I
used up this one is from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and it's D carried away scent I
thought this was nice honestly this
isn't my favorite bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks scent
but it smells really good in the shower
so I wouldn't necessarily repurchase
this scent because I want to be a little
bit more picky with the sense that I
choose but I did enjoy this it was
definitely not like a chore to get
through I have an old packaging of the
batiste dry shampoo this one was
actually in my kit but I decided to take
it out and use it up and then I put a
new one in just because it was getting a
little old and I didn't want to have
stuff in here that was too old so this
is one of my all-time favorite dry
shampoos ever it's inexpensive I get
mine at Marshall's I recently went and
got the big sprays and they were $7.99
apiece which is an amazing price when I
had first purchased those they were
$9.99 so two dollars down and they have
about two of the smaller cans in them so
that was a really good deal I would
definitely check out your Marshalls /
batiste I have yet another simple
micellar cleansing water I do really
like this I have one more big size of it
and then a couple like travel-size and
then I'm out of all the ones I bought at
Costco I just in general enjoy a
micellar water to take off my eye makeup
which you guys know I don't want
anything too greasy when it's around my
eyes it just irritates my eyes so much
so I enjoy this I would probably
repurchase the Gardening one or just
whatever one I can get on a good deal so
many brands make
Celer waters now so I definitely want to
try out other ones I also have a
Bioderma and I might go through that
it's I've been saving it for my kit but
I haven't been going through my cellar
water and my kit quite enough so I think
I'm gonna use that on myself and then I
can get a new one for my kit just again
to keep things in rotation that's like
the biggest struggle I think with being
a makeup artist is you buy so many
products because you might need them but
as you don't use them or as time goes on
they potentially can get expired or just
get older and so I really want to make
sure that I'm not letting things go to
waste if I can help it and just like
rotating things out into my personal
collection if they're not being used and
giving fresh things to my kit and
whatnot although you guys don't need to
know that I thought I would let you know
my mindset all that I used up a candle
this one is from herb and Irma and it's
lemon and olive leaf I enjoy this candle
I love the packaging I love it so much
I'm throwing it onto the ground but I
just don't like the way this burned it
still has some up on the sides and this
honestly I forgot that I had it lit so
it just like burned all day long and
then was done so maybe the way it burned
is my fault because it was just like one
continuous use but I would think that
that wouldn't be a big deal it says that
the burn time is up to ten hours so yeah
that makes sense it was like a full full
day this really didn't put too much
scent into the air so I don't know I
wouldn't repurchase these I got these on
Black Friday not last Black Friday but
the one before that and they work half
off so I think these were like $3 apiece
which I thought was a good price I think
I'm gonna reuse the tin will see if I
actually embark on that project oh this
one is an insane accomplishment this is
the Cetaphil moisturizing cream this is
what me and Sam would use on her face at
night I really enjoyed this cream we
were using it on her face I know it says
body but you can use this on your face
if you want to it does definitely
moisturize right now I'm using the first
aid beauty very similar to this it's in
like a big old tub and you can use it on
face their body or wherever you want to
you this one feels really moisturizing
but almost feels like there's a barrier
on the skin like I don't know how to
explain it
it doesn't feel like it entirely sinks
into the skin and so I don't know if I
prefer this one on my first date beauty
one so far with what we're trying
I'm mostly I'm trying to just get into
better skincare though I think this is
great don't get me wrong it was like $11
or $15 at Costco with another little one
it lasted us for freaking ever so I
think price-wise and everything like
that and just to get hydration into your
skin Cosumnes just has really dry skin I
think it's great for that but I really
want to work on just using some acids
and like you know really trying to get
rid of my big pores I'm not even sure if
you can really do that but just kind of
get more into skincare be a little bit
more knowledgeable when it comes to that
and so I think this is great if you want
something simple and affordable but I
think the direction that I'm trying to
go is different than this I guess I'll
just talk about the other skincare
product that I have this is the number
seven protect and perfect intense
advanced serum I put this in a
collective skincare review kind of video
I like to do those types of videos which
I might have one coming soon depending I
don't know I'm getting a lot of skincare
in the mail soon from Sephora I'm really
excited anyway in that video I said that
I really did like this I thought it felt
nice on the skin and this was something
that the more I used it the more I just
I didn't enjoy it I felt like this kind
of stayed on top of the skin I think
this has quite a bit of silicone in it
which feels really nice at first
especially for your skins in a really
healthy state but if you truly need
hydration and in the winter months I was
needing hydration and when I went to
Arizona for like Christmas and stuff I
really needed hydration I just felt like
this didn't let things penetrate into
the skin and I felt like I was having a
lot of dry flakes still I just didn't
think it was like really repairing my
skin the way I wanted it to it's not
that it's bad it just didn't I don't
know I just it's not worth the price to
me I would just go with something else
in the drugstore I wouldn't pick this up
again and I would not want to use up
another one which is so weird it's like
sometimes you really do need to try
things out for a really really long time
because I did I tried that out for
probably a good three weeks before I
gave that review but once it was toward
the end of it or what's my skin maybe my
skin was just in a better state when I
was using it then but when the seasons
change and all that like I just it
wasn't working for me this is skincare
but not like for the face this
is a Crabtree and Evelyn citron hand
cream really enjoyed this I think that
their hand therapies are really nice
this is the second one I've used up from
the pack I used to believe and ER one
before which I really enjoyed the smell
on to and this one was no exception it's
just great nice I really enjoy this
moment when I go to bed and I put this
on I'm using one right now called the
source and it's not my favorite it's the
first one I've come across that I don't
really like the smell of I think that
I'm gonna try to use it up and just see
if I can do it if it's not gonna like
irritate me too much but if not you will
see it in the clutter at some point but
yeah I was kind of surprised that one it
was really strong too compared but I
really like the citron one I would get
this again I have a hand wash here from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the Honey
Crisp apple and it's in the foaming
version I enjoyed this I think it's nice
it's a great kitchen scent and I love a
nice clean fresh apple scent this is
something that I really really loved
it's the equipment anti cavity
toothpaste and I got this with the
equipped toothbrush that I got sent to
me from optilead this was supposed to
last three months which it didn't quite
make it that long but me and my husband
were using it it wasn't just like for
one person I just really liked the taste
of this it is nice and minty but it's
not like a peppermint it's more closer
to like a wintermen or something a
little bit off
I personally don't enjoy the taste of
pure peppermint I like a spearmint or
wintermint just something different but
I love spearmint and wintermint like I
do truly love those so anyway I enjoyed
this I thought it was great I'm going to
be repurchasing more of these in the
future so yeah I highly suggest this
toothpaste it's good I have a little
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works wallflower here this
is the one that was used up and I
honestly don't know the scent it smells
kind of Christmasy and it has like
snowflakes on it so something
Christmassy and then the one I just put
in today is the warm vanilla sugar from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works such a classic scent I
am really trying to use these up this
year I think I only have like five more
and then I have the one that I'm using
currently so I think I can get through
them definitely this year I just need to
like remember to put them in when they
run out just a little quick one here
this is a facial razor I get mine at Big
Lots this is the brand bio Swiss I think
you can get three for like a dollar
fifty so I definitely do
spending like $15 on the one at Sephora
or whatever I think it's ridiculous
these are super cheap and I like to use
these to do my in between my brows I
like to do my lips I like to like get
any like whiskers or whatever on my chin
I'm a very hairy person I have a lot of
peach fuzz and I find that whenever I
wax it always break out so I try not to
wax my eyebrows or even pluck them as
much as I possibly can help it but this
helps with the like peach fuzz that kind
of grows in the middle of my eyebrows
more than anything that's what I used
for the last few things that I have are
all for the hair this is the melanin
gets cilantro hair conditioner and
peppermint shampoo I freaking love the
shampoo and conditioner so much I am so
surprised by how much I like this this
is in the top 3 shampoos and
conditioners I've ever used in my life I
actually used up the conditioner in the
shampoo at the same time which is so
abnormal for me I usually use up the
shampoo first because I have fine thin
hair gets really greasy really fast and
I find that a lot of the times I will
like double wash my hair and I barely
use any conditioner because I don't want
it to get very greasy
but this one does not leave my hair
greasy it just feels great they just
work together so well this scent it's
interesting and refreshing it's not
overpowering my hair just felt really
healthy without feeling fake and silky
smooth you know how some conditioners
can just feel like they leave a film and
I almost feel like my hair is like dirty
again highly suggest this these bottles
also lasted a really long time to me
these felt like they were small they're
8 fluid ounces which is normal but I
just thought I was going to go through
them so fast but I didn't they were
great I would repurchase this I want to
repurchase this this one in the Moroccan
oil volumizing shampoo and conditioner
are like my two favorites that I've ever
used
speaking of Moroccan oil I have a dry
shampoo this is in the light tones they
also have a dark tones for people with
darker hair so you don't have a white
cast I love this dry shampoo it not only
smells great but it works really well I
miss it but I'm kind of moving back to
patÃ­s just for price right now until my
mom can get me more at her price that's
the only way I'll purchase this is with
the discount which is because $26 at
least from my budget currently is a lot
of money but I do think it's worth $26
if you have the money
so this is just a really great product
and last I have the Paul Mitchell hydro
cream whip this is a frizz control
touchable hold mousse and I enjoyed this
product I thought it was fine I did like
that it gave a bit more moisture than a
dry like crunchy mousse but at the same
time I felt like this could easily weigh
my hair down the thing that I disliked
about it the most is the smell it's wild
ginger and I'm realizing that ginger is
not a scent that I like it's just a
little too spicy for me this was
definitely a like manly ginger scent and
I just didn't want my hair to smell like
that I felt like I got clean and then
put this in and then it's just kind of
like in my hair I just didn't I didn't
like the scent very much so I would not
repurchase this I did not repurchase
this I got a different Paul Mitchell
mousse actually and we'll see how that
one goes
but if you don't want a scent and this
sounds interesting I think it's a good
product and I would check it out
especially if you have more like medium
hair not necessarily superfine or thin
hair alright guys that is it for my
empties for the month of January I
really hope you enjoyed the video and I
will see you in my next one tomorrow
