it's Lauren I have some fun videos to
film for you today I'm really excited
about them I know that you guys will all
probably really like them so they're
like new but they're like good solid
channel videos videos on my channel
anyway I thought I just addressed my
hair really fast I did diet pink again
and then I have it in my little double
bonds and I have glitter roots going on
so you know I just got back from
generation beauty it is saturday today
and i will be working a generation
beauty on sunday we got to just go and
enjoy the convention itself and then
tomorrow we'll be working it so since I
looked L cute I thought I'd film and
haven't filmed in a while I miss you
guys i miss filming yeah ok anyway long
intro sorry about it let's get into this
this is going to be my January empties
video I cannot believe January is
already finished but it is and I thought
at the beginning of this month I would
not have any empties I was like oh my
gosh I'm not gonna have empties oh my
gosh I gotta you step up I have so many
mg's I don't know how that happened like
the last week and a half it's been like
empty empty empty empty so let's get
into these products these are all newer
products in my empties I don't put
things that I finished in projects or
that are in like other things that I'm
trying to empty if that makes sense just
so that way you guys can see fresh
products and not get bored that's just
something I like to do there's also some
makeup in here which is awesome that I
finished up and we'll just get into it
let's go let's go I have like a new
empties little thing cuz I'm trying to
be organized but it's not working first
I have some cotton swabs or q-tips
that's what we want to call them q-tips
um I've had this for forever I don't go
through q-tips very fast I don't know
I'm not like cleaning my ears out every
day probably should but I don't and so
yeah finally went through some of those
I'm gonna get a new one yeah how does it
deal I have three dry shampoos and
they're actually all different instead
of just uppity system this is the dev
one this is the refresh and care volume
dry shampoo I really like this but I
don't like it as a dry shampoo i like it
is just like a texturizer or something
to add a little volume it's really great
on first day here or even on second day
here if you're going to be putting it up
to really give that texture I do enjoy
this and I would repurchase Battiste we
all know there's no need to go into it
it's my one true love and I love it and
I dental dry shampoo video I'll link it
down below but this actually does not
have aluminum in it so it's awesome I
mean my dreams and like prayers have
been answered and I didn't even know it
so I just wanted to correct that this
does not have a loom in a minute so
that's awesome I think because it's like
a UK product maybe they don't they
aren't allowed to make it with aluminum
I don't know they have like better
standards or something I don't know but
just a little correction on it awesome
it's even more awesome than it already
was and then the last race you what and
then the last dry shampoo that I used up
this is from suave and it's just the
keratin infusion one I don't know I did
actually really like this if I was in a
pinch and I wasn't gonna have Battiste
which I probably would just go with
Battiste I would definitely go with this
if you're looking for an even cheaper
option then Battiste this is a great one
after using the whole bottle I will say
it's my favorite drugstore dry shampoo
sticking with hair stuff this is a
shampoo from Schwarzkopf it's really
hard to say this is the color freeze my
mom bought this for me so when we
started dyeing my hair colored and stuff
so i've been using it since about um
thanksgiving she bought it for me so
that way my hair color would stay longer
the guy at cosmoprof for work she got
this said it's a really good one color
just comes out of my hair it doesn't
want to stay it doesn't matter what I do
so I wouldn't say that this helped I
mean it's sulfate free but I feel like
most of the shampoos I have our sulfate
free and that's really what you want if
you want to keep your color longer cuz
sulfate just strip your hair so I mean I
think that it did an okay job but I
don't think that it did anything so
spectacular that I would purchase this
again I would just make sure I went
sulfate for you with a shampoo if I was
trying to keep my color hopefully that
makes sense as I said in the beginning I
did dye my hair pink eye
did see someone's comment about doing a
video about me dying my hair which I
will do for you guys it's just we're
gonna get personal here i am usually
like half dress Sam's half dressed I
have to have him to help me because I
can't like do my own hair it's kind of
this uh this whole production really and
so I would definitely need to make sure
to like set the timeout and do all these
things to make sure my hair's died and i
wanted it died before generation beauty
so i just didn't get a chance to film it
before I dyed it pink but I am working
on that so the next time I die I will
film it for you guys I seriously don't
do anything special but if you guys want
to see it I will do it I have manic
panic here I didn't even have like half
of this left so I just combined it with
this color icon color this is in the
color rose and I did these two together
and then I added a bunch of conditioner
and seriously it barely tinted my hair I
think this already has a lot of like
filler agent so that it is a pastel
color on the hair so if I could go back
I would have just done these two
together added no conditioner and i
think i would have liked it so i used
those up in one like turn dyeing my hair
and then literally like two days later I
dyed it with this one this is the ion
color brilliance neon brights in the
color flamingo it is kind of the color i
have here I do not think the color
matches the outside of the bottle it's
definitely more purple which I'm okay
with like a warm pinky purple I like
that color I just think that it's a
little misleading the box and everything
also I didn't add any type of
conditioner anything to this because I
was like f it i'm gonna go bright and
i'll just let it fade out and it'll be
pestell in like three weeks or something
but this is the color it was so um
definitely not a neon bright I don't
know I just think the next time I do it
I'm gonna just get like full-on color
and I'll just let it fade out I don't
know that's just how I feel it takes so
much upkeep to keep your hair a color
it's crazy so I love it and I don't even
I don't know when I'll go back to blonde
because I just love being colored now I
just love the look of my hair pink I
feel like it matches me if matches
my insides and I just like it I mean it
works well for the industry i want to be
in any way so so many tangents in this
video I'm sorry guys I just I like
talking to you yeah so use that up
that's always going with that I have
some hand soaps here this is the snow
kissed berry and if you can see that Co
it's green this was I think originally
blue so I definitely think that I me I
didn't smell bad but something with the
color went off and I'm glad I used it up
it just makes me again want to use my
products up and not just have such a
back stash or like horde of them wear
colors of the bottle and the product are
changing because you've had it so long
anyway I use this up I wouldn't purchase
the Sun I didn't really like it that
much it was just sweet berry nothing
special but it took Christmas sent that
I got out woo another person was sent
this one is fresh balsam I love this
scent I just love ball so um I love that
Christmas tree evergreen for sent it
smell so good I would repurchase this
and another Christmas send out this is
the realest still micellar water you
guys know I really like this product
again I wouldn't repurchase it for the
price it's like about thirty dollars it
is a huge bottle but I do think there
are comparable drugstore options so
personally I just don't have a ton of
money to spend so I'll just get those
but I do think this works really well it
is a great product me and Sam used up
another one of the rodial Dragon's Blood
sculpting gels I do really like this
product I use it at night because I find
if I use it in the morning and I go in
with a primer it can ball up and stuff
so they just don't work well so I just
use it at night it feels really nice
really smoothing I think we have we're
using one we have one more left I wish
this wasn't like a hundred dollars I I
would not purchase it for a hundred but
if you're wondering about it i would
suggest trying it out or getting a
sample or like getting it on a deal yeah
it was great i got mine at costco and
they were so cheap there but they're out
now sorry hmmm i used up the last of my
walgreens cotton rounds and i did make
it to big loss thank you to all you out
there who told me about the cotton
rounds at Big Lots so I did stock up on
those they're like a dollar twenty there
which it's still not a dollar but it
and Italy better so I did like stock up
on that I have like a whole drawer just
full of cotton rounds for my kit and for
all so myself so I love those and
they're great and they're just as good
as these but they're not like to
something so yeah I used up a toothpaste
this toothpaste is okay nothing special
I like the Colgate the white one optic
white but again I know you guys know we
have a costco pack of these I think well
I like two more left though so we're
almost done these little guys came in a
set from work when i was working at a
beauty store I got these as gratis this
is the nukes detox serum I did a review
on this i'll leave it linked down below
I do really like this product I did
definitely miss it if I had the money I
would buy the full like size of this
it's $75 but I do really like it and
then this this is the serum and then
this is the moisturizer this is the
regenerating night cream I thought this
was nice um I thought they paired well
together as I was saying before my
camera died on me I do think that this
paired well with the serum but I don't
know if I'd spend the full price on it
it smelt really nice it smelt really
natural kind of like grapes or something
like but like this skin of a grape the
way that tastes without the sweetness I
don't know oh I know that's really weird
but that's what it smelled like it was
nice I don't know if I'd your purchase
I'll tell the makeup last I know I'm
sorry but it was just kind of at the
bottom here I have two of the mini
Beauty Blender cleansers I love this
cleanser with the Beauty Blender it gets
everything out if you guys want to see
the way i clean my Beauty Blender but I
mean you can get like every stain out
with this I love it and I've been trying
to clean it more trying to be sanitary
so I use these up and I have like two
full-sized ones ready to go I changed
out my little Wallflower so this is the
old one and the new scent I have in is
vanilla snowflake this is a super sweet
scent I don't really like it I
definitely wouldn't repurchase and it's
kind of hard for us to use Sam like
hates it he like hates it so I'm trying
to work through it so we can just get it
done I just have this little tiny like
glass cleansing white from target I do
really like this I bought like the big
size and like the mini travel case when
I got new glasses which will be in soon
so excited but i do like these i think
they're nice i would get like a pack of
them another floss we use the same floss
this is the reach minted no mint waxed
flaws it's great I use up a or I have
one of these going right now this is
from Bath and Body Works it's the autumn
ascent portable I don't have it in my
car yet i'm about to move it but i have
a lot of these and i want to use them up
because i don't even use them so i'm
trying to work on actually getting use
out of these i had this in my kit and I
finally used it up in there this is the
realest I'll micro moisturizing fluid I
do really like this I used up a couple
last month in my project use it up and I
think it's a great I think it's a great
moisturizer I would consider purchasing
this I think it's really nice it's great
under makeup it's moisturizing but not
like greasy or anything it's really good
one if you were interested now on to
makeup and stuff I'm so happy that I
even have makeup to talk about oh shoot
I have a hand cream let me show you that
I decided to shave hang creepers sorry
for the tease this is the utterly smooth
hand cream I got this at the dollar
store I did really like it I thought for
a dollar this is really awesome it dried
nice on the hands it was a good one I
would definitely consider repurchasing
this once I don't have hand creams I
seriously feel like most people can't
find a good hand cream and I feel like I
found so many like there's so many I
would repurchase but i do think for the
the price the value of this is awesome
so for one dollar I think it's a great
hand cream now actually on to makeup I
did finish up a liner this is the Stila
convertible I color eye pencil in violet
this is one of the products I want to
use up a 2016 super awesome i already
finish it up and yeah it doesn't twist
up anymore I can't even make like a
little sound this one wasn't pressed a
very hard so I feel like I went through
it a lot faster than like the berry one
some of those took me a long time but
glad this is done this is the brow is by
anastacio this is in the color taupe I
really like this pencil I definitely
would repurchase it but i do want to try
the Knicks won before I like repurchase
this i have also quite a few other brow
pencils to use up before or purchases
but it's a great one it's expensive but
it is good this is
a fresh lip balm this is just the
regular lip treatment one me and Sam
love this lip balm Sam uses this he
mostly used this one up it is all gone
and looks like he even dug out a little
bit like yeah we love this i am going to
repurchase the Nivea one and see if he
likes that one just as much but I
definitely will like get a couple of
these once they're on a sale or I can
get them like cheaper than the regular
price this is something I used as a
primer in my kit this is the Murad
invisible or perfecting shield this has
SPF 30 this is a great base to apply
foundation on top of it has a very
silicon feel it smooths the skin texture
it can fill in pores a little bit it
does have SPF so that's something to
like keep in mind but it is really
awesome I have one more of these little
samples in my kit currently I don't know
if I'm going to repurchase the full-size
once I run out of that cuz it's hella
expensive but it is really nice if
you're looking for something that's kind
of like a one and done you can use this
as your moisturizer it has SPF and it's
a primer so it kind of can do everything
in one if that's something you're
looking for last empty this is from nude
sticks and this is the sculpting or like
contouring highlighting duo I have the
shade like light and medium there's a
little bit of the medium left but it's
too dark for my skin I don't even know
if you can see that this is so awkward
to hold it so tiny but I did completely
use up the light side and yeah I did
enjoy this I thought it was nice I
thought it went kind of fast though so I
don't know if I would pay the 20 for
dollars for it I did enjoy it while I
had it I think it's good if it's
something you're looking into it's a
great product it's just kind of
expensive and i would like to explore
other options see what else is out there
but i did use it up those are all my
empties for the month of january
obviously I didn't start all of these
products in January but I did end up
finishing them all this month I think
this is a great start to the new year
with empties cleared a lot of stuff out
a lot of stuff I didn't realize or you
know think I would clear out which is so
so cool that's everything I hope
guys enjoyed this video and I hope you
guys are all having a wonderful day
thank you so much for all of your
support as always i truly appreciate it
and i will see you in my next video bye
