channel it's Lauren this is going to be
kind of a new series on my channel it's
going to be basically a monthly
favorites but instead of just mentioning
everything i'm just gonna edit it down
to five picks for the month i am
constantly panning stuff so it is hard
to have a bunch of new favorites on top
of the fact that i'm trying hard not to
bring new stuff into my collection so
it's hard to come up with a ton of new
things that you haven't heard me talk
about also I feel like I declutter a lot
and I do a lot of stuff like that so
it's fun to show you guys things I
actually do like I had someone requests
like I'd love to see what you do like
and there's a ton of stuff I do like so
I'm excited to this series I hope you
guys are excited too i mean it's not
that big a deal it's just monthly
favorites but it's only five things
anyway let's get into my top five things
for the month of january i have to put
the glow kitson first I got these last
month because honest asya was doing a
convention at my husband's hotel that he
works at so they were there for like
almost the whole weekend it was right
before I'm at and he was able to snag
these for me so I got these for free
didn't even have to pay for them and
they're amazing they are really great
formula my favorite one is the glow kit
and this is in the color gleam there's
two of them and yes I'll Nastasia
herself signed it so um that is also add
to favorite it's amazing but these are
the colors here this one's perfect for
fair skin and I especially love the
color starburst I really like crushed
pearl too but starburst is probably my
absolute favorite out of the palette
what I love about these is that they're
buildable so you can have like a really
feathered brush or a light hand and just
get a nice soft glow or you can pack it
on and build it up and it can be like
metallic so I like that with this you
can kind of choose what look you want on
top of the fact that you're getting so
many different colors that you really
can just customize it to however you
feel you can use uses eyeshadows I just
think they're a nice product and they're
different than what's already on the
market because the Bekaa ones are great
they're creamy but I feel like it's kind
of like glow or note below like you
don't get that in between and I really
feel like you can get in it between with
this and then i'll just show you the
other color this one is in that glow in
this one would be perfect for darker
skin
um for more golden skin and this is like
a really light yellow highlight this
one's great for my kit but on my fair
skin it's this one is more like really
glowy bronzers instead of highlighters
the next favorite for January was just
pink pink in general it doesn't matter
what it was glitter eye shadow brow of
hair I loved pink I really couldn't stop
wearing pink I'm wearing even pink today
Morgan in my brows I'm a lower lashline
there's pink glitter in my inner corner
I just love pink right now it's like a
neutral to me it's like a warm brown but
instead it's pink and I'm sure you guys
have seen this in my like double bonds
video I have pink hair and I have like
the pink glitter routes and stuff I just
love it so some of my favorite products
i have here these are just some pink
vials of glitter i use these to make my
clutter roots if you want to know how i
made those and like want to see a video
on that it's not that hard i really just
put some glitter with gel and applied it
to my roots but this is some of the
glitter i use for that and i really
liked that I thought it looked really
good this is a glitter liner from
Sephora this is in the color sweetheart
pink it is what I'm wearing on my inner
corner right now I really like this i'm
pretty sure i might have mentioned this
in a different favorites video but it's
worth a shout out because it's pink and
i just love it i really love it i also
have been using these you guys have seen
these a lot but these are the Stila
countless color pigments this is an
Indian this is in spotlight dang it
center stage I was not called spotlight
but I've been using these in my brows i
also have been using the kat von d we
vida loca remix ballot in my brows the
shade here is in the color swoon it's a
matte paint I loved using that in my
brows this month I also love the Urban
Decay electric palette the hot pink in
there is like stunning that's probably
my favorite hot pink but it's a mic it
because I like to have color just in
case any color when I'm on the go I just
love it I love pink even the pink blush
that's in my tarts finished 7 by spring
I've been loving using that in more
places and Jess on my cheeks as a blush
like just pink has become the new
neutral for me and I've loved it i
really want to dye my hair like hot pink
like not pastel pink like hot pink I
have kind of been changing up my
foundation routine this month I was
panning a deluxe size of a powder
foundation
and then I was working on bare minerals
foundations and then I did most recently
get this one I just have it to show you
but just in general powder foundations
have been something different in my
collection now that I've never used them
before but just I'm reusing those again
and I've really been enjoying them
there's just something so easy about
them they give you coverage I mean if
you want like insane full coverage
they're probably not for you but you can
build up a lot of powder foundations to
be quite full coverage and if I differ a
little concealer under my eyes on my
blemishes and then go in with a powder
foundation I just feel like it's really
effortless really easy I don't feel as
cakey throughout the day and it's just a
nice look I've just have been enjoying
that look so um this is a newer one to
my collection this is the pure minerals
foreign one I think this is a good one
but again I'm just saying in general I
also have the tart one I also have the
airbrush Amazonian clay one I also have
the bare minerals original which that
one's not my favorite because it's quite
glowy if anything I'd go with the mat
one on that one but yeah just in general
that just kind of more easy effortless
foundation look instead of just taking
on so much product not that I'm down for
some product but just lately it's been
nice to have just a more refreshing
foundation routine last like product
just in general lashes I've really been
getting into lashes these are from our
dell these are the glamour 113 I also
really love like demi wispies just
anything with that really fluffy natural
look I also really like ones that have a
clear band they're just easiest for me
to apply I also enjoy applying lashes in
like an underway so I don't put them on
my lash line I put them like underneath
my lashes and cut them up and stuff if
you want a video on that let me know
it's just been nice to have an enhanced
lash look I really like the look of long
lashes that's my thing I'm not so been
on volume but length is like I love
length so it's been nice to wear it
lashes more often this last month and
I've just really been enjoying the look
of it and I just feel sexier I feel like
it really completes a look I don't wear
them every day but I just find whenever
I do wear them i really really enjoy the
look so i never thought i would say
lashes but lashes
my last favorite for the month of
January would be just all the amazing
opportunities I had in January working
with my school I did a demo at IMATS you
guys know that and that was amazing I
worked on my first feature film for day
and then I worked on my own short film
not that I had the short film but I was
the makeup head I was only make a person
I did everything for that short film
which was amazing it just was a month
full of opportunity I mean generation
beauty was at the tail end of the month
and that was really awesome so just all
those opportunities with my school were
amazing I'm really happy that I got the
chance to just do those and experience
that I feel a lot more confident in
myself as a makeup artist and I really
think that working just so hard last
month and doing so many different gigs
and just really honing in on my craft
really helped me to feel more
comfortable in it and I'm really
appreciative of that and it was really
fun although it was crazy it was really
fun and I just really enjoyed that so
those are my top five favorites I'm
gonna keep this video short and want
them just to be short little spurts of
hay like this hey like this so I hope
you guys enjoyed I'm filming a ton today
so I know you guys will see me a few
more times like this but I will see you
and I hope your having just a wonderful
day thank you so much for your love and
support and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
