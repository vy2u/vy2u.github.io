I'm gonna do two jacks opposing video so
this first one's gonna be an empties I
have a lot of stuff that's been building
up I even moved with my empty switch
I've seen tell me people like I'm gonna
do an empty saw them to move my trash
like now I moved with my trench that's
how dedicated I am so I have an empties
video and then to juxtapose that I'm
gonna film a gratis hall for july so
stuff that I've cleared out and then
stuff that I'm bringing it let's get
into my empty products and see what I've
used up it's been quite a bit of makeup
so that's good because these aren't in
project pans this is just more makeup to
add to my yearly count which is awesome
I'm super excited all right let's get
into it so to start off with makeup
let's go there first I've used up two
concealers the first one here is
enabling dream lumi in the color ivory I
really like this concealer i'm using
another one that i have now that was a
backup and i really do like it so i use
that up and then i used up the
maybelline fit me one in the color fair
this is also one of my like holy grail
concealers so these two together I
usually use the Sun to the eye on this
on the face and I really like them so
definitely would repurchase have
repurchased I love these I finally
decided to call it quits on my eve pearl
liner it's just not performing like it
was I've had this for so long like way
longer than you probably should but it
was working so i wasn't gonna like get
rid of it plus i got this for sale on oh
look for twenty dollars like it was on
sale for twenty dollars so i wanted to
use it until it was like dead so it's
dead now I would repurchase it's just
expensive I like the kat von d 1 so i'll
probably go with that one but if you
were thinking about getting it it is a
good one another eyeliner I've used up
this is the make up for ever aqua eyes
in the color black it was just like a
mini site so it was probably only like
about that big but it is gone now I
can't really sharpen it anymore so I'm
really happy about that I'm trying to go
through liner so another one bites the
dust I wouldn't necessarily repurchase
it it wasn't amazing to me I finished up
a foundation which is really exciting
this is the mary kay timewise matt where
liquid foundation in ivory for I've had
this for awhile it
a very full coverage is very light so i
use this a lot of times as a mixer with
darker foundation especially like my
beautifully matt won from number seven
beauty which is like my favorite one
that won the lightest shade is a little
dark so it mix this in and it took me a
long time used up because i own i only
ever used it as a mixer foundation but
it's gone now which is kind of like
bittersweet because it worked really
well for that but it's gone so bad as
exciting and then i have too many
primers this is the pixi flawless and
poreless i have been working on this for
a long time I finally just finished it
up so this one's gone it was in a
project and I didn't finish it which it
only had like one use left I don't know
what I was thinking but it's gone now
and then at school I was using this as
my primer so I finished it up it's a
Smashbox photo finish primer this is the
oil free one I wouldn't necessarily
repurchase this I do have like a full
sized one ready to go but I'm going to
finish up a lot of my other primers I
think this is nice for like smoothing
out the skin getting it ready for makeup
application but I don't think it
prolongs the wear or like Phil's &amp;amp;
poor's really long term or keeps me Matt
which is what I look for in a primer so
it's good probably for a lot of people
but it doesn't do everything I needed to
so it's a good one for like clients
that's all the makeup I know that
doesn't seem like a lot but to use up a
bunch of makeup items on top of like
having projects and stuff is amazing so
and I don't rishu anything that is
currently in a project in my empties if
I finish it so that's been like all
individual or after a projects already
ended and then I finally finished it up
yeah that's all the makeup I finished to
like perfume type items so I finished up
my Daisy dream this is in the one ounce
I believe I wore this until my wedding I
love this end I love like all the Marc
Jacobs fragrances except for honey I
don't like that one it was so nice to
use I'm sad that it's gone but it is
something out of my collection I do want
to work on just getting stuff out of my
perfume collection because I have a lot
of stuff I just don't wear so it's sad
that the one that I cleared out is one
that I actually do wear but it's still a
success I definitely am going to
repurchase that once I finish up more
perfumes and then
did finish up a little spray as well
this is the country chic from Bath and
Body Works it's just a mini travel size
and it's gone it didn't take much to
finish this up because it it's a small
size so using it I feel like I could see
the difference every time I used it
because with sprays I don't just spray
at once I spread it like a ton of times
because it's a very light fragrance and
I'm glad it's gone I don't think I'd
repurchase it I don't love the scent
like I used to so that one I wouldn't
repurchase but I'm glad it's gone i'm
trying to get through a body mist too
because i just prefer perfumes over body
mist so would not repurchase onto hair
things i have two booties they're in
here every single time i absolutely love
Battiste it's my favorite dry shampoo
that I've tried so far especially man I
always do this like backwards especially
for the price i got these at marshalls
so they were only 599 to even cheaper
than like eight dollars that you can
find them at like Target and stuff and
this one's my favorite scent this is the
floral essences but when I can't find
this I go with this one which is the
blush sent I will continue to repurchase
this is an item of getting rid of just
because it's old this is the bumble and
bumble surf spray I got this in a
sephora set a really long time ago it
came with a bunch of like mini sized
products of like the favorites for the
year I do enjoy this product when I
first used it anyway but it just doesn't
smell the same and I feel weird using it
so I'm just not going to put myself
through the torture of that so yeah I'm
getting rid of it and makes me kind of
sad because I know this is an expensive
product but I'm glad I don't like it I
didn't like it originally so I don't
want to repurchase it so that's good no
I would not repurchase we're now on to
skincare stuff I only had three haircare
things I don't go through hair care
because I just do this with my hair
every day and it's psycho I have this
drying lotion from Mario Badescu I am
also getting rid of this because it's
just old I need a new one I do enjoy
this product the only thing i don't like
about it is that it smells like sulfur
after I've had it on my skin for a while
and I cannot stand the smell of sulfur
especially like if I have a bunch of
acne spots which I have been having
recently I'll put him on there and then
when I wake up it just smells like
sulfur all over I just I don't enjoy
that so I might be looking for an
alternative to
I am using the Murad one right now
that's a spot treatment and it works
pretty nicely too so i don't know i
think this is great for other people but
I don't know if I would repurchase it at
this point I have one makeup wipes this
is the last of my skin light makeup
cleansing tissues these where the green
tea scent I got these at the korean
market they were only a dollar
ninety-nine so if I ever find myself
somewhere where they sell these and
they're that cheap I will repurchase
them because that's an amazing deal and
I do like the way they work they don't
irritate my skin they take off makeup
really well I like these as like a pre
cleanse so I can just get all my makeup
off my face and then wash my face with
actual like cleanser and I don't have to
do as much work especially like what
stuff at school it's just I use cream
foundation it's just so thick I need
something just to get that off because a
lot of the times the cleanser isn't
going to cut through that makeup so
anyway I would repurchase these as soon
as I find one I hate that it like is
putting a shadow on my face this is a
caress body wash this is in daily silk I
did not like the smell of this I used
this up I liked it came in a double set
a long time ago from my dad for
christmas and it was like a Tahitian
something which smelt delicious and then
this one which was like man so i would
not repurchase this one um but it's gone
i finally used it up this thing it's all
mangled this is the same eyes blemish
control apricot scrub i absolutely love
this product to me it smells kind of
cinnamony but i think that the granules
in here really nice Sam also really
likes this product and I just keep it in
the shower because every time I shower
i'll just exfoliate my face because I
don't shower daily and I think it just
really helps too um I wouldn't say
minimize my pores but just like get the
dead skin off and make my skin feel
really fresh and clean and like ready
for moisturizer when I get out of the
shower so I would repurchase this but
I'm willing to try other stuff too but
it's just a good cheap one that I know
works I used up this mini size of the
body shop coconut body butter I actually
was using this on my hands next to my
bed every single night so it's
completely gone I at first didn't really
like
the coconut smell I thought it was kind
of light and not that great but it
definitely grown me in a good way i
thought this smells so delicious at the
end it's more like a true coconut like I
know it's still not very fragrance and
perfumed but it's not like a bath and
Bodyworks coconut it's definitely more
subtle and a little bit more natural if
that makes sense i don't know for you
you know what i mean by that but i
really enjoyed the scent of this I don't
know if I drew purchase of a product
because it is kind of a heavy product
and I don't like a tunnel oceans but I
got through it the rest free skincare
all like sample or like deluxe I samples
or things i took from work this is the
Clinique dramatically different
moisturizing lotion + this is for the
dry really dry skin I enjoyed this
moisturizer you needed the tiniest
amount and it covered like your whole
face I could wear it underneath makeup I
would probably go for like the oil like
for oily skin or combination skin but I
just got this in like a gift set Sam
also use this product it was nice i
would consider repurchasing it it's on
my list of like this was a good
moisturizer but I have so many other
things I need to use so i won't be
getting it anytime soon if i decide to
go with it i finished up this Wren keep
young and beautiful instantly firming
beauty shot this product was okay it
definitely felt firming but I talked
about this in my sample roundup I just
finally finished it um it just felt like
I was putting egg whites on my skin and
the similar feeling you would probably
get from firming from that is how this
felt I mean it was a little better more
like skin care but a similar just like
the product tightened on my face that's
why it firmed I wondered purchase it
yeah I used up this ultra luxe age
control nourish and wash it's like a
face concert it was definitely
nourishing so it left not like a residue
but definitely more moisturized feeling
on my face instead of like a strict
feeling so I think for anyone with
mature skin or you know um wanting
anti-aging properties or anything
moisture this would be great for them
but that's not what I need so it was
just okay to me and then I took two
samples from work and I loved both of
them this is the mirror clarifying
cleanser I really liked this cleanser it
kind of left like a heated feeling
honest
like icy hot type of feeling I really
liked it and I kind of am considering
purchasing this once i go through
cleansers which with all the gratis i
get happens a lot i could get a lot of
cleansers so we'll see how long it takes
and then i also used up this eminence
clear skin probiotic mask and i
absolutely love this as a spot treatment
so i've been breaking out like i've said
in every video but i was using this to
spot treat with and what i loved about
it is it also felt like icy hot on my
skin but it didn't like give me dry
patches so when I used to Mario Badescu
or even like them your ad fast fix when
I use those products especially after
like a couple days it dries that area
out i took flaky and gross which is what
they're meant to do like to drive a
pimple out but this like cleared it but
it didn't leave me superdry it was still
hydrated it was great i really liked it
I don't know if I'd buy the whole mask
just for a spot treatment but if I'm
ever breaking out really bad it'd
probably take another sample of it if
you have the money or if you want to try
a mask I feel like that works really
well for clearing this is a really good
one on to like random stuff that I've
used up this is kind of a long video I'm
so sorry this is like an old old used-up
product I just found it when we were
moving this is the Chesapeake Bay candle
in perrin mint this melt so good at
target in the store and I broke my rule
of not buying I only buying bath body
works candles to buy this because we had
gift cards from our wedding and it
sucked like this I'd throw this was
horrible you couldn't smell it at all so
I will happy buying any candles probably
again that aren't like higher end or
like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's just not
worth it why am i spending 13 dollars on
a candle that does nothing does nothing
I will not repurchase obviously really
random and kind of grows and I'm getting
rid of this we don't have a shower that
needs this anymore so it's gone it
worked well as a squeegee it was from
target um if I needed to use one again
I'd probably repurchase this is a dove
deodorant in the cool essentials send
which is like a cucumber one i just
bought a huge packet costco of these but
i think i'm going to try to go more
natural I just it freaks me out so I do
have more to use up of these but my goal
is to hopefully go natural and find
something that really works we'll see I
used up to hand washes this one is in
coastal surf and Sun and this one's in
perfect beach day these both came from I
think the same collection last summer
and this is one of my absolute favorite
sons ever it smells so good I think I
still have one more left i bought like
four or five of them because I love them
that much and this one was just okay
it's just like beachy but this one if
you can find it or if you have it you
know what I'm talking about it's so good
I have so many Bath &amp;amp; Body Works soap so
I probably won't repurchase for a while
but they are some of my favorite soaps
for the bathroom so I probably
repurchased I have a thing of cotton
like pads these suck they're from the
dollar store I would not repurchase
their so Finn oh they're horrible do you
not get this is a floss from reach is
that the brand not sure used up it was
ok I'm not that picky about my floss and
it was a mint-flavored boom and last but
not least I am getting rid of this
loofah this is from bath and body works
they have my favorite loofahs because
they're like full and thick but they're
not two gents wear it like it's too
scratchy or two exfoliating or hard I
really like these this one had like a
colorful like scratchy like glittery
things so I didn't like that get just
like a rope one and then the one I'm
using currently it has like a sewn into
it has like a fluffy crap like a crab
stuffed animal inside the loofah and I
would not recommend that because it I
wash these out every time I'm in the
shower I wash them out till they're
clean and then I hang them to dry
because I'm really weird about like
mildew and mold and that whole thing so
I do that every single time and with the
one I have now it takes forever because
it's like a plush inside there but
anyway these are my favorite i'll
definitely repurchase that's everything
guys those are all my empties so far I'm
this is going to be I guess my July
empties and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
