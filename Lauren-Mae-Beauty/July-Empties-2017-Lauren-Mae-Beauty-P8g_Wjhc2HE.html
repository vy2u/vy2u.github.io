Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to show you guys my
empties for the month of July I have
quite a few empties I'm really happy
about it so let's just dive right in if
you want to watch more of these though I
have a playlist linked down below so you
can get yourself I'm starting with
makeup items first the first thing I
have here is from Mac this is the Mac 6
plus and this will the travel size in
neat coconut scent
I love mac fix+ the original I think
it's really good this coconut one just
doesn't smell that good I don't suggest
it I just suggest the original the
original smells so nice it's like a spa
it's very refreshing I love it
this just did not live up to my coconut
dreams and so I do not suggest this and
it's like $10 so the small one just get
the big one for 20 I've decided to part
with the sponge this one is the real
technique just regular orange one I
didn't really ever use this I sell that
I don't like the Real Techniques sponges
I just preferred the Beauty Blender it's
just my favorite I know it's expensive
but to me it's worth it so yeah I'm just
getting rid of this it's just been too
long I know there are a lot of sponges
out on the market now that are a lot
better than they used to be so I kind of
want to try a few others see if there's
something that I like a little bit
better than the Beauty Blender but when
it comes to Real Techniques I think that
they're good and I understand why people
like them but they're just a little
they're almost too cushy anyway and last
for like makeup type of items I just
have two mascaras the first one here is
from Marc Jacobs this one is their
velvet noir mascara I got this from
Influenster and I thought this was a
really nice mascara I thought this gave
really nice volume the brush on it is
kind of like an hourglass shaped brush
it builds up volume fast it's really
dark and black I even got my mom to
purchase this product and she really
liked it too so I do think this is nice
I'm not sure if it's worth the money I
really feel like most mascaras work for
my eyes unless they flake or do
something weird I have pretty long
lashes naturally so it takes a lot for
me to really hate a mascara and the
other mascara that I have here is from
Eden minerals this one is the ultimate
volume buildable care mascara I also
really did enjoy this I think something
that I do tend to like in musky
is a natural bristle brush that can
filled up a lot of volume and separation
I'm not for clumpy lashes but I do like
to add a bit of thickness a little bit
of depth because I don't wear false
lashes and I usually don't even add
liner so I need some of that dark
definition this was super black and I
did really enjoy it I'm just gonna go
random for the rest I'm sorry I was
thinking about trying to up the quality
of this video and do like skin care in
this but honey we just going for it
I just I can't I can't be bothered so
let's talk about the teeth because I
love it this one is the tropical and
this is like the jumbo size I got this
at Marshall's for ten dollars usually I
get the smaller or regular size cans for
449 at Marshall's but when I did the
math this really was only a couple cents
more I thought I'd try it out it's kind
of nice I didn't have to like go through
a couple me and Sam both use this you
guys know it's my favorite dry shampoo
and then again the tropical scent is my
fave some more hair stuff I guess it's
kind of themed
these are the viral celeb luxury washes
this is how I dye my hair now this one
is the light pink and I don't really
like this one because it doesn't dye my
hair pink enough I'm really into like
hot pink right now not just like a tinge
of pink but if you want something that's
really pastel and a bit more subtle this
is a nice one for what I use on the
everyday this is the viral extreme in
the color hot pink I love this I just
finished it up today
it just keeps my hair vibrant I don't
even dye my hair with a regular die
anymore I just use this it's so good
highly suggested and although I talked
about how this wasn't accessible or
wasn't very accessible earlier I believe
that this is now available or more
readily accessible oh how many times can
I say that on Amazon so I always link
everything down below just for your
guys's convenience so if you're
interested in this I will have links
another hair thing maybe I am using
things I don't even know this is the
Nioxin scalp therapy conditioner I have
it in number three number three and four
I believe our four chemically treated
hair and one and two are four non
chemically treated hair the conditioner
is what Sam goes through
the fastest because he thinks that this
is what the real light medicine is in
this is the part of the treatment that
you keep on your head the longest you're
supposed to leave it on the hair for a
good one to three minutes I don't
believe you're supposed to leave the
shampoo on for really any length of time
so I don't know what he does if you like
drinks this in the shower I'm not sure
but he always goes through it faster
than shampoo I will probably continue to
buy this but Sam does have issues with
dandruff and like a dry scalp so we've
moved to like head and shoulders for him
but we probably would go back to this
okay let's do a fun one this is the Turk
wanna connect I love this scent it
smells so good and I finished it up I
just bought the small bottle when I was
at the store and if you want to see a
whole haul of like different Mac things
that I thought I will leave a link down
below I'm kind of sad this is gone but
it's definitely something I would
repurchase I probably just buy two big
sizes like you know I like it yeah it's
a really good one
I don't enjoy the bottle though I hate
these really pointy edges like I just
feel like they're dangerous I can't
handle it other than that I wish was
just like a nice little black bottle
than a weird square thing I have like
about a million so staring up at me so
we'll just run through these I get all
my soaps from Bath and Body Works for
the most part I think they're really
good I like catching them on a deal I
love the different scents I love the
packaging just there's so many good
things this one here is just peachy it
has it's in our kitchen I would not I
don't really think I like peach sense
anymore like I used to for about the
body works
I still love eating peaches and I do
like the smell of peaches still I just
don't know what it is about the Bath
Body Works ones they just kind of don't
smell that great to me so I probably
won't be purchasing any more peach type
of sense I don't know it has to really
be special for me to grab it another one
I have here is ocean citrus we're using
it in our regular bathroom which is kind
of weird because it does seem like it'd
be a kitchen scent I really did enjoy
this
I like citrus scents I like more fresh
scents so this was really nice and I
would repurchase and in case you're
wondering preference wise when it comes
to foaming or the regular hand soaps I
don't really have our
I feel like I go through the following
one's really really fast but then when
it comes to these ones they always have
some left in the bottom so it's just
like a trade-off anyway on to the last
one this one is the white pear and fig
one in my all-time favorite sense this
will trump a couple holidays ago I
stocked up on them because I loved it
that much and I just decided you know
it's time to let it go use it up enjoy
it and move on I still love this scent
though I would definitely purchase this
again I just felt so good
something about the pear and fig just
are really sweet but in just such a nice
way it's not like sickly sweet it's just
so good anyway I really wish they would
come out with the scent again just do it
we'd all love it we'd all purchase it
and by that I mean I for sure would but
that is the next time spent on hand so
another s gr some q-tips I use these for
work a lot I used to clean up my makeup
it's a q-tip you clean your ears ah you
do what you got to do with the q-tips I
have some cotton rounds these are the
slipper ones I really do like them I
guess I'm at Costco I feel like these
are pretty affordable for the quality
that you're getting when you buy them at
Costco is well yeah so I have to say
about those as well I am so much
fastened boiler stuff I never bought
them say works thing this is the stress
relief eucalyptus spearmint body wash
this is what Sam uses he really likes
the scent I really like the scent it's
kind of nice it's a little bit more
zingy and refreshing and as opposed to
really sweet and it's a nice switch up I
have some wipes packs these ones are the
wet and wild under the sheets ten makeup
remover I bought these at the dollar
store I don't like them I would
repurchase them they were nice and big
but they weren't super moist I didn't
find that good took my makeup off very
well just a waste of money
if you only want to spend a dollar on
some wipes get yourself some fel wipes I
love yellow beer oh they're my favorite
I think most of them are good though
everyone in the comments love these too
we all love these they're a dollar at
Big Lots so go buy you some white I have
another one of my simple cleansers this
is B micellar water and I have a ton of
these backed up because of Costco I do
like this I think it's nice
now I feel like I run through it so fast
though I don't know why that is but I
just I moved through these products this
is a nice one though anyway just
repeating myself I have three more
skincare type of products this one is
the pure joy stick it's an exfoliating
like stick cleanser and toner all in one
that's what mine looks like it's kind of
grody because I used it all up I love
this product I was really excited about
it I was hoping it would be quick and
easy and just a nice on-the-go simple
product and it actually was it works out
that way I highly suggest as products
for men or anyone who just wants to kind
of simplify their routine it's great for
travel if you don't have to bring a ton
of products with you but you can also
feel like you have a good skin care
system it's very essential for me to
scrub my face basically almost daily I
know that maybe people won't think
that's good but I get a lot of dread
skin around my nose and really I just
love the feeling of just a nice fresh
skin moisturized and supple to apply
makeup on top of so I really enjoyed
this I travelled with it I loved it it's
so good I definitely would repurchase
that next is this little crumpled up
thing this is the embryo release a late
cream concentrate it's just kind of like
the regular moisturizer I'm trying to
roll it up for you guys
it comes in like a metal tube like this
I really do enjoy this I use this in my
kit I believe this is my second tube and
I repurchase it so I repurchase it three
times now
well I purchased it three times
repurchase it twice technically it works
for all skin types I like the way that
it moisturizes the face it's more
sensitive so I don't have to worry about
stuff like that so overall I do think
this is really nice and it's not overly
expensive which is also great so one
thing I will say is it does have a bit
of a smell to it
almost kind of like old lady ish but not
super intense um but I still use it in
silicon and last for skincare this is
the Bioderma hydra bio serum i really
like this as well
this felt so nice on the skin me and Sam
went through this kind of
it was in a favorites video I do highly
suggest it I would definitely repurchase
this again I do have a bit of skincare
kind of wrapping up right now um so I
won't be purchasing this at the moment
but I think back on it fondly and I
would repurchase it I have two more hair
products this one here is just a travel
size it's the kms AirPlay molding paste
I use this in my kit and I love it for
flying I loved it in a small size as
well because it just was easy to squirt
out a little on my hand and I would just
take some of that warming up in my
fingers and then go and like you know
touch any flyaways that needed to kind
of be put down without losing a ton of
volume that's always like the trade-off
it's like do you want a lot of volume
okay you're gonna have flyaways or do
you not want flyaways and you might not
have a lot of volume but I found this
gave me a nice balance I repurchase
something similar to this but I would
love to repurchase this actual product
it also smelt really nice it had almost
this tropical scent it wasn't anything
like too invasive or crazy but it was
just nice I liked it and last for hair
this one is the puff me volumizing cloud
mist you guys know I like to use this
Sam mostly use these he goes through
these in a month like it's nothing
the dish's adds a lot of texture just
like a volumizing powder would but it
has a spray pump on it so you can go
cheat and it's easy I still have quite a
few of these left I have been using the
big sexy hair one and I do enjoy it I
think it's really nice so whichever ones
cheapest at the Beauty Supplies one that
I will be giving and my last couple
items here and have a toothpaste this is
the crest scope it's okay and last I
have a Wallflower from Bath and Body
Works not sure what this scent was kind
of fruity sweet nectarine and peach
maybe I don't know these are all really
old so you can't go get them anyway
probably right now but the new one that
I put out is the red guava lava and that
is everything for my empties guys thank
you so much for watching
felt good to go through a lot of this
stuff I'm excited to throw it all away
and start again
for August I hope you're having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next video Hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
