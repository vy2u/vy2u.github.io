gratis hall now I've done a couple of
these i'll link them all down below in
the description but this is a Hall of
all the stuff that I've gotten from
working in the beauty industry so it's
not anything I've paid for but I don't
get scented or anything it's just
because of the job I have I just work in
like a booty stored on do anything
special but when again people tell you
that they get free stuff they get it all
the time because brands are constantly
wanting to train you on their products
and then let you experience those
products for yourself so that you can
let customers know how great they are
and if you love them so let's get into
it I do have a lot of stuff this month
because I did go to like a training like
a bigger training with two different
brands so they usually and those they
give you like more products and stuff
because it's more in-depth than just
like an hour training and this isn't me
bragging I just I'm trying not to buy as
much so I don't have a ton of halls or
anything but it's just me showing you
stuff that's going to be coming into my
collection if you want reviews I know
that there are some reviews is still
need to do so trust me and I'm working
on that and I just want to make sure the
products like I know the products and
how it feel on them before I do that for
you guys but I will be adding a nukes
when up and I want to do a nude sticks
one still so i will be getting those up
soon you want any reviews from the
products you see in this video let me
know in the comments down below and
let's just get into it so I was lucky
enough this month to be trained by
deborah lippmann we were trained by like
the global trainer for deborah lippmann
which was really exciting so she did
some great training with us on like
cuticle care as well as just like the
care of the nails and also let me know
why deborah lippmann so expensive it's
for good reason so some of the products
that I got to take away with me were the
rich girl hand cream this is a really
thick moisturizing rich about hand cream
it's really nice I really like this it's
won many awards so I'm excited to try
that out I got like two maintenance
products this is the new all about that
base base coat it's kind of like a CC
cream for your nails so it does a bunch
of things has a lot of benefits and
to base coat as well i also got their
cuticle remover and i've already used
this i used it at the training but i've
also used it since hello my fingers are
painted they haven't painted in forever
I was super hyped after like the meeting
to actually take care of my nails so i
came home and i did the cuticle
treatment so I got the cuticle treatment
or remover I also got a nail file this
is the smooth operator buffer it has
like four different sides to it and it
has like 20 uses in one of these sticks
so that's awesome and then I got two of
their polishes I believe these are from
the same collection like the desert
sands or something like that some desert
collection this first one is shifting
sands it's like a nude color they said
that they made this for like every skin
tone like a nude for every skin tone
this like more topi purple grey is love
in the dunes so that's going to be
really pretty for fall I think both
these are great colors they're not like
glitters are super exciting in that
sense but they're ones that you can wear
all the time so I'm really excited for
these and then just let you know why
deborah lippmann polishes are so
expensive is that they are like a
treatment they have a nail treatment in
every single product so as you're
wearing these new plushies they're going
to be making your nails healthier
they're going to be making them stronger
they're going to be growing faster so
that is why they're more expensive just
saying if you want to review on any of
these products let me know in the
description box on that same day we also
had a training with Numa which is hair
stuff now Numa is a really awesome brand
their sustainable brand they're
completely usda-certified organic which
means that their products are at least a
minimum of seventy-three percent organic
just in general if you're looking for
something that doesn't have parabens
doesn't have sulfates doesn't have
anything horrible in them these are the
products you're I don't want to go to
they spend a lot of time with their core
values that's what holds together this
whole line it's not about money
necessary
for them on like how much the costumes
but instead about making a good product
that's also good for the consumer
especially in an age where not
everything that we're putting on our
bodies into our bodies is actually good
one of the demonstrations actually did
for us was like we put the product in
our hand and then after 23 or 27 seconds
they were like that's already entered
your bloodstream so what are you putting
on your scalp or on your hair on your
skin is it does affect your body you
know your skin is your largest organ I
know I see this and everyone but um it
kind of is kind of making me just think
about stuff I put out my body a little
bit more but yeah let me get into the
products I'm excited to try these
products and going into it I was kind of
like rare but after the training I
definitely feel like this is a great
option for a lot of people especially
people with sensitive skin this would be
a great one where like things don't work
for them because they're allergic or
they have reactions this would be an
awesome line so Nemo was extremely
generous so I got the shampoo and
conditioner this is the moisturizing one
this is actually a shampoo and
conditioner that you can use um any hair
type can use so even if you have fine or
thin hair you should be able to use this
moisturizing shampoo and it not be an
issue so I'm really excited for that
because usually moisturizing shampoos to
me are like ah stay away it's going to
weigh your hair down so I'm excited to
see how these ones hold up to that claim
I believe the rest are like styling
products so this is a tangle me free
it's like a spray-on leavin detangler
this is the new volume blowout mist and
it's supposed to give you volume and I
think it's supposed to also make your
blowout like be faster like blow drying
your hair faster these are all full-size
to I'm telling you like so nice of them
this is an argan oil treatment so it's
really similar to the Moroccan oil but
it's scentless it's colorless so it's
great for sensitive skin or blondes who
have problems with Moroccan oil like
darkening their hair and stuff so
there's that one and then the last
product they gave us is this new styling
smoothing cream so this is like a
product you have put in before you blow
dryer after you got out of the shower
and it's just going to help soften like
control frizz and
give you a better base to style your
products with to style your hair with so
that's everything from Numa we also got
I mean the bag it came in is super nice
i'm gonna use this for groceries and
it's like 90 s it goes with their whole
theme of like being sustainable they
only work with sustainable companies
there I don't know do some research on
your own but I think they're really nice
brand again if you want any reviews or
more in-depth let me know I happen to
get trained by elemis yesterday as well
so many trainings lately seriously
elemis is like a British skincare brand
but they also sell them over here
they're also on a lot of cruise ships
that is where you'll find them or in
really expensive spa so we got to pick
like what kind of set we wanted I chose
the soothing set because I've been
having my acne I get red really easily
so I thought that's a big oven for me so
it came with their sensitive cleansing
wash it also came with their cellular
recovery bliss capsules these are like
it's kind of like a detox treatment for
your face so you use one oil capsule at
night 10 10 capsule in the daytime and
then you do that for 30 days and then
you are done with your treatment you can
do it like up to four times a year but
I'm excited to try these out I did like
sample it on my hand and the oil one
just skin really nicely and I feel like
I could wear makeup over it which is
exciting and then my favorite product
probably out of all of them is the
soothing apricot toner this is like a
toner you can put on your face after you
cleanse your skin you can also set your
makeup you could do so many things with
it it's a really nice refreshing smell
it smells like apricots it's really nice
and that all those products are really
excited to test out and try I have a
couple things from Iturbide say so in a
churro us a couple months ago was like
what we got well however much we sold
throughout the month we got gratis for
so um what I chose was this spray this
is the oxygen perfecting oil so you use
this you shake it up it's like a dual
phase product but you shake it up and
then you spray it on your skin it's kind
of like a refreshing oil but it doesn't
feel like an oil it still just it just
feels how
it's like a skin missed basically but it
has that oil in it it's so nice I really
like this product it's great for someone
who doesn't like a lot of lotion because
you can spray this on after the shower
and get those benefits of like
moisturizing without feeling greasy so I
really like this product and then a
small little tiny sample size of the
inhibit tensile lift I got this because
I did an online training with them and
this product retails our store for like
seven hundred and twenty dollars
something in saying so this is a really
small product but I did it out it's just
like a 70-something dollar sample it's
crazy i'm gonna give it to my mom
because it's like a Botox and a bottle
type of thing but um yeah i got that
crazy I don't know if I could ever spend
that much money on skincare maybe if I
was super rich but still it's like
obsessive excessive it's supposed to be
really good though lots of active
ingredients but not saying it doesn't
work I'm just saying oh I also got some
stuff from Fleur de France we sell like
oils and stuff from them so i got this
pure eucalyptus body wash or bubble bath
from them and then i also decided to get
yet another toner i'm gonna be like
toned out this is a face and body mist
hydrating atoning and pure lavender it
smells so nice and beautiful i think
it's going to be a great one especially
at night when I cons my face just to
have that lavender smell and not
relaxing you know missed from the
lavender so I'm really excited for this
although I have a lot of toners now I
like two full-sized ones that's a lot it
takes a long time to go through this
plus I have that naturopath a hydrating
mist like oh really early on in the
month we had a train from keratin
complex and they just came out with this
new product door it's a newer product
from them this is the sweet definition
texturizing sugar missed so it's kind of
like a sea salt spray and supposed to
give you that BG textured look but
because keratin complex caters to people
with like Brazilian blowouts or like
keratin treatments in their hair salt is
only going to break that treatment down
faster this is like an alternative to
that with the sugar spray so I haven't
tried it out or anything yet we'll see
it's also like a dual phase
I'll show you the product actually I
guess and ooh that's what it looks like
kind of like the ocean it's really
pretty but you shake it up and then you
use it so we'll see it kind of can
replace that bumble and bumble one that
I just got rid of um I don't think I
have anything else quite like this in my
collection so at least I'm not like I
don't have like seven sugar sprays or
something the rest is makeup so we're
finally on to make up here guys um Jane
Eyre Joel came in and they gave me this
warm Sienna loose powder foundation I
think this is a small size maybe its the
regular-size I'm not sure that's what it
looks like it's a little yellow for me
but we'll see we'll see how I can make
this work or not um yeah it's supposed
to be more luminous and stuff so i don't
know i'm excited to try it out because a
lot of people really like jane eyre girl
cosmetics we sell a lot of it but i
don't know we'll see it's a loose powder
which is always well they're harder for
me to go through for sure not being
ungrateful just being realistic with
myself so I might pass that along to my
mom is ultimately what I'm saying in
this video last but not least I was
trained by a woman from by Terry this
month as well which is really exciting
because I'm going to take over this
makeup portion of the store which I'm
really excited for and I wanted to know
why by Terry is the price it's at again
what what are its features and benefits
of their products why are they great who
are they for all that type of stuff
because if we're going to sell someone
something that expensive I want to know
and have confidence that they're gonna
love this product or that it's going to
work perfectly for them and so it was
really awesome to get trained by her but
anyway she gave me four products they
only have to show you because I gave
some to my mom and my aunt Monica when
they were in town but first off I have
an eyeliner this one is in the color
royal navy now by terry's eyeliners are
freaking amazing they're so creamy this
is it's like a cobalt blue color it's
absolutely beautiful they just stay on
the skin for ever they do not come off
once they set they are set it's amazing
I'm really excited to have an eyeliner
even home dry to give them up this is
such a beautiful color it's like a
darker well it's like a medium blue but
it's still bright it's
beautiful and it also comes every single
one of them comes with a sharpener so
that is really nice I'm really excited
to like do a look with that or even just
like a bare face with like the blue
liner and that's it it'd be so pretty
she also gifted me this Cherry Bomb
tinted lip moisturizer now this isn't a
pot form which is not my favorite but it
is like a French line so in France
anything in a pot is like more luxurious
that's why a lot of like French skin
care is in jars because it looks nice on
a vanity it just as more like sure it is
to them so um yeah I wish it wasn't in a
pot but it's definitely a beautiful
color and haven't used it yet because I
want to make sure I want to use this
before I start using it and if not I
could gifted or whatever it smells
really nice it has rose in it and it's a
really pretty color I think this would
be a great one for summer sofa money is
it's probably like the best time to use
it right now but I just don't want to
get into this product until I decide I
maybe use up other products or decide I
want to use it the other two products
that I got gifted were part of their
hyaluronic sheer nude range I had number
one and number two and I gave them to my
mom and my Annika just because i have so
many lip products you guys know they're
my hardest thing to get through like
it's so difficult to go through lip
products for me and I just knew they
would use them more when they came into
town they bought some stuff for my store
and I just thought that they would enjoy
them more plus they have a very strong
Rose sent to them and I personally did
not enjoy that so I knew that would just
be another factor against me actually
getting through them so I passed them on
to people who would enjoy them so much
more than me I think that's it um I
guess just like a little bit of thoughts
at the end here one of the things I've
really learned from getting all this
product it's so exciting and I'm still
I've only been working here for about
three months now so it's all still so
new to me it's all so exciting and I'm
so blessed and every time they give us
product I'm just like so blown away by
it because
I'm used to being the person who buys
those products and spending like retail
amount on these products and so it's
just still such a shock to get them I
have tried to be very careful especially
now that I've kind of seen how much
stuff I really am getting to not use my
products like immediately unless I know
that I'm going to use them up because
I'd rather pass this product on or save
them or get regift them to other people
and not in a way like oh now I won't
have to buy birthday gift but just like
passing on the benefits of this job to
other people because a girl can only use
so many products and on top of that i'm
already product junkie and Hardy by a
ton of products myself so it's
definitely something I'm taking away
from this because I mean there's no way
I could go through that much face wash
in a year for all the face washes i get
so anyway I just thought I'd put my
thoughts and at the end there because I
know it's a lot of product that i get i
thought i've been showing and i realize
that and those are kind of like steps
i'm taking because i do a lot of project
pan in here on my channel those are
steps i'm taking to kind of keep under
control the products that i have and
just make sure that i'm using stuff up i
just don't want to be wasteful and i'd
like to pass on anything I can to other
people in this you know like loved ones
that I have around me or whatever like
pass on the benefits of this job to
other people especially if it's
something I'm not going to use or is
going to go bad before I can use it up
but anyway that's everything for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it again
if you have anything you want me to
review or if you want more information
on let me know in the comments down
below thank you so much for watching
guys I truly appreciate it and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
