Lauren this is going to be my July
favorites again I apologize if you can
hear any like weed whacking or any type
of people doing yard work I can't
control it and I need to film aho let's
just get into my top five faves for july
I've been crazy busy in July but there
are a few things that have made my life
a little bit easier or things that I've
just been enjoying so let's get into
them beauty products first my first
favorite for beauty is going to be this
elf pencil this is two dollars and it's
their brow pencil I have the color taupe
I believe this comes in three shades if
not for sure too I think this is so good
for the price this comes with a spoolie
I think the school is decent definitely
not like the worst fully ever it's not
as good as like the Anasazi ones but
it's still really awesome and then this
is a twist up pencil this does not have
a fine point like Anasazi one but it's
not a super fat point either mostly I
just love the color of this product it
works really well in my brows this one
is completely gone so you'll see it in
my empty soon I just think this is such
a good value for two dollars and it
lasted me with continuous used probably
three weeks as you guys know though I do
have blonde brows so I'm not just using
brow pencils to fill in some sparse
spaces I'm using it to give my brow
color in its entirety so I feel like I
do go through brow products a little bit
faster than other people who have
naturally dark brows just because of
that reason I think this is just a
really good product i'll definitely be
repurchasing more they work really well
in my kit I just I really like this and
I cannot beat the two dollars I just had
a brow product in my last favorite I am
constantly changing out my brows even
now obviously my hair is purple nail
which is another kind of favorite just
fun to go back to color and my brows are
different today so I sorted my brow
stuff all the time but it's just nice to
be finding some products now that I do
enjoy and that aren't super expensive
just because I go through them so
so fast another Beauty favorite are blue
toned pink colors I just really like the
look of this type of pink with my purple
hair I like that Mick's of this ashley
purple with this like cooler toned pink
so the first product here this is
clinics cheek pop in the color plum pop
I really like this it's what i'm wearing
on my cheeks today i just think it's
really fun and again i just something
about this color with this hair i just
want to always pair it together and then
the other product i'm also wearing this
this is a lip gloss this is the buxom
full-bodied lip gloss and this is in the
color strutted I believe this was a
limited edition color but again just
anything in this like really baby cool
toned blue purple pink colors I really
have been enjoying i also have a similar
color like this in my finished 13 by
Halloween and it's that tart like lip
pencil I've been using that a lot lately
I just really like the combination and
my last beauty favorite is this
eyeshadow now i feel like i have an
eyeshadow like this in every favorites i
talk about these types of colors all the
time but this one is from Coastal Scents
so if you're looking for a more
affordable option than even honest hacia
or makeup geek and you don't want to
shell out a ton of money this is pumpkin
pie by Coastal Scents it's a completely
matte color and it is such a nice warm
kind of orange brown transition color
right now I have it all over my lid and
in my crease that's how I've been doing
my eyeshadow lately because i've been on
set a lot i find that the products i
want to use on people are products that
i also use on myself because i know them
I trust them and they're just what I'm
into and again want to use on other
people so I find that with eyeshadows
and different things if I really like
something I want to put it in my kit and
use it there so I've been exploring
different things in my collection for
myself because I have been putting those
items in my kit and this is one of them
I've really been enjoying this and I
just think it makes such a nice look in
general though I have been just loving
like an all mad I the same color one
tone from the base of the lashes all the
way up into the crease blended out I
just think it looks really nice it's
simple to do but it still looks put
together I've just been enjoying it and
this is the color that I've been
enjoying
the most for sure I'll have everything
linked down below if I can find it but
I've really been enjoying this and these
hot pots from Coastal Scents come out to
195 apiece and if you can get them on a
deal that can sometimes be just a dollar
so i really have been loving this and i
find that the quality is really nice
I'll swatch it really really fast and
that's it there so definitely been
loving this I have two more favorites
for the month the first one is going to
be when my mom came into town she was in
town for about a week this month and it
was really difficult to get to see her
in between working I worked every single
day she was here except for one day on
saturday we went up and did wine tasting
and that was really fun I've never done
that before but I just enjoyed spending
time with her and it was just nice to
have her here and to do that so that was
definitely a favorite of mine I'm sure
she's watching this video so she'll
think it's super sweet that I included
that and the last favorite of the month
I can't go without saying that I I'm
sorry but I love Pokemon go it's so fun
me and say I'm love playing it I'm not
like obsessed but it's definitely a fun
thing to do when we're out or if we walk
to go get dinner or walk to the grocery
store just different things like that
it's super fun we live in a busier area
too so there's a lot of like polka stops
and pokemon around where we live which
is nice and I just think it's so fun i
grew up with Pokemon we traded cards
cards got like band at my school because
people were trading them during class
and just different things like I grew up
in the craze I know all the names i know
the evolved forms like i know a lot
about pokemon before this game came out
so it's just so fun to be able to like
catch pokemon yourself i think it was
such a cool idea I just have been
enjoying it a time and so Sam it's just
something fun for us to do so that's
everything let's keep this video also
short and sweet and I will see you in
the next one please let me know what
your favorites are down below and I will
see you bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
