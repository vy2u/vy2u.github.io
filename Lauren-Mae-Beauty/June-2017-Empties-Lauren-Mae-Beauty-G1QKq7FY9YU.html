Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to be my June empties I
have quite a bit of stuff here
especially when it comes to makeup so
let's just get straight into it I will
be showing you the makeup first
the first item here is been nice neutral
set this is just the original
translucent I really did like this this
was in my makeup kit and I also used it
on myself towards the end because there
wasn't that much left
I really like this I really like loose
setting powders actually I feel like
they really do mattify the skin with the
least amount of product and they are so
spin you can just put such a thin layer
of product on a skin and it just looks
nice so I do want to repurchase that I
also have the RCM a no color powder I
feel like I like the Ben Nye a little
bit better so if I had to repurchase I'd
probably just repurchase the bend 9 next
is a primer this is the Smashbox
photo-finish
regular original primer I had this also
in my kit and then when it was getting
towards the end I just switched it out
because I don't want to carry around
product to the last little drippy drop
what I have already so many products so
I do like since I think that there is
something about this primer that people
forget why this is good I know I forgot
why this is good this definitely kind of
does everything all in one
it does mattify the skin it does prime
the skin and make products last longer
and moisturizes it's going to give you a
nice smooth base so that product isn't
cling on to dry areas like I really do
think that this preps the face really
nice for application especially as
artists so I do really like this product
I would potentially consider having this
in my kid again I just feel like it
works on so many different skin types so
many different ages of skin like it
really is just a great product I have a
powder from Maybelline that is finally
gone this was in my 10 pan roulette
video and it was so close in that video
ended up finishing this in Vegas but it
was I'd already filmed that video so by
the time I edited it this was actually
gone but the footage wasn't anyway it's
gone now I thought I would show you the
empty packaging I didn't love this I
probably wouldn't repurchase it I know a
lot of people do like it though so if
you were interested I do suggest it this
is just the translucent one it was okay
I finished up an Iowa
this one's kind of bittersweet to me
because I'm excited it's so so tiny
I cannot sharpen it anymore because of
the metal here and it's like starting to
hurt my eye this is bronze Manila from
pop beauty you guys won't hear me say
that anymore because it's done and I
really did enjoy this I felt like it
stayed on the tight line really well it
didn't transfer time I didn't find that
it was like out here or in here you know
too soon or anything like that like I
just really enjoyed it I would
potentially repurchase this I have some
wire as I need to finish up but I did
like this everything about it the color
the formula is good this is a clear brow
gel I found this when I was cleaning out
my collection doing my declutter series
and it just it's done at Asus for
definitely a year I really like to be
honest Asya clear brow gel I think it's
a really good one if you're looking for
something that's going to keep your
brows in place all day
I feel like this product left me
basically a whole year so elbow is
expensive I feel like the investment is
worth it because it lasts you so long
and it really does keep them in place
two more
makeup items this is the lorac behind
the scenes eye primer
I like this eye primer I get it for free
with the palette that's how I've always
gotten it but I potentially would
repurchase this as well for my kit I
think it's nice it doesn't get too much
of like a colored base to the eyelid but
it does have something more than just
clear I don't know I feel like it's nice
it set my eyeshadow on and it didn't
crease irrelevant and lacks is the Holy
Grail makeup item this is the Maybelline
fit me and this is the concealer and
fair I love this
I feel like this just gives the perfect
amount of coverage the color is really
nice on me like everything about this is
just what I'm feeling so I do highly
suggest that it's great you can use it
on face you can use it on to the eyes it
works everywhere it's just a perfect
product now we are going to move on to
this big bucks here of all my other
empties so just going from what's on top
the first thing I have here is the st.
eyes blemish control apricot scrub I
really like this I know some of you guys
say that this is really bad for me to
use but maintain really liked it and
it's really inexpensive and that's the
thing that's so hard I do really like
the pure joystick as like an old
but it is it's just more expensive it's
like $24 which I really like it and I
probably will repurchase it or something
like it but for the times when you just
you can't justify it
I really like the scrub its scrubbed it
smells good it just works for me
next is a Bath and Body Works hand so
this is the white lily and lime I really
did enjoy this this was in my kitchen I
thought it felt really nice and
refreshing it had that citrus but also
something a little floral definitely an
interesting mix something I would
repurchase again I got wipes on wipes on
white so many facial wipes I don't know
if I was just in the middle of a bunch
of these or what maybe swatches I don't
know what what happened these are all
from the brand fel they're my favorite
you gets in that big loss these are my
absolute favorite these are the aloe
vera ones I went back to getting the
dollar package because they didn't have
the bigger package but these are a
dollar for 30 wipes and the aloe ones
are just so good they're super moist
they take off all of my makeup they take
off my eye makeup like they work so well
I love having these my makeup kits like
depending on the situation like let's
say someone is super dirtied up I just
had a situation we went out to the
desert we found like this apocalypse
scene and I I was like oh do you want me
to take off your makeup right now that's
fine I was like well here here's the
pack of wipes and I can just give them
the white without being like that was
twenty dollars you know I just like that
I can just use them like they're tissue
essentially and not feel bad about them
but they're also amazing quality on top
of that for the price like what anyway
you guys know I love these so I have
three of the aloe ones the grain tease
my next favorite this is the bigger pack
that's two dollars for sixty and then
this one's two works whenever and these
are just facial cleansing wipes don't
get these ones another thing that's in
my empties all the time is the petite
dry shampoo this one then fresh I love
the tropical one but just batiste in
general I think is the best dry shampoo
for your money another hand soap this is
the coastal Sun and surf from Bath and
Body Works I love the scent this came
out a couple years ago I bought quite a
few because it's one of my favorites I
would repurchase this scent again I
don't know
come out with it though I did enjoy it
while I had it more Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is the pineapple mango candle
this is also an older item this melt
okay when I had all the doors open and
like the windows open so I was just
getting a bit of a whiff of it but on
its own in my small apartment with all
the doors closed it can just be a little
overpowering I'm glad I got through this
one it's not my favorite
I don't think pineapple scents are my
favorite they smell good like if you're
just in the storm you like it smells
good I like to burn a whole candles
worth of the pineapple for me it's just
not it's not my thing so I probably
won't purchase more pineapple to say
that now but I know you don't think I
look I do have another candle as well
this one is the garden essence urban
Emma
coconut and cilantro I got this at
Target for Black Friday
all the candles were half off which is
such a good deal this is originally only
six dollars and so it was only three and
I got him as like stocking stuffers this
smelt really nice but I didn't feel like
it really you know spread throughout the
house I got it was okay I thought it
burnt pretty decently well there's just
a little layer of wax at the bottom the
tins cute like I don't know I feel like
if you just have this in your room it
might be nice but it wasn't my favorite
ever
whispers cotton rounds love these Gator
Matt Costco these are the encapsulated
ones I'm glad I found something oh
there's one in there I guess I'll use
that tonight but I'm glad I found
something that works for me that's just
like easy I can buy them in bulk and I
feel like the price isn't too bad okay
my shirts are always like crazy on my
neck I'm always like getting attacked by
things next I have a conditioner this is
from the brand Numa and this brands like
all-natural cruelty-free it's really
nice it's a good brand I thought this
was okay it had a really nice scent to
it all their stuff is like naturally
scented with like essential oils and
stuff it's nice I really I like a more
herbal type of scent and that's what
this has I enjoyed it but I wouldn't go
out of my way to purchase this I got
this for free so that's why it was
awesome this is the simple micellar
water I really like this I personally
enjoyed the Garnier I think a little bit
better than this one but I got such a
good deal on the net Costco that you
will be seeing these forever more
but I do still really like that I just
love micellar waters and out there just
not Gracie and they can take all your
makeup off I have quite a few hair
empties this month
this is eat puffs me it's volumizing
spray I really like this me and Sam both
uses in our hair to add texture and grit
definitely make sheriff feel a little
bit dirty a little bit like you know
khaki but this is great for me when I
put my hair up in a bun and it's like
first day hair just gives it a little
bit of something because it's just so
fine and then it just like sticks to my
head and then luckily anyway we really
like this to go through these quite
often I have another volumizing powder
this one is from big sexy hair now I
have this little size for the longest
time this does not have a spray
dispenser like the puff me one I feel
like that makes this more inconvenient
but it also makes the product last a lot
longer
so I would just like to tap this into my
hair you can also put this into your
hands and then kind of like rub it
through where you want it I think both
of them work knives I just prefer the
spray version my mom actually brought me
the spray version of the big sexy hair
so I will be trying that out and we'll
see which one I like better this is a
Pantene pro-v shampoo and I got this
from a pinch me boss I did like an
unboxing they sent me there like vlogger
box and so I used this up pretty fast I
did enjoy this it smelt pretty nice it
worked well and it's inexpensive which
is nice I haven't used a drugstore
shampoo and the longest time I realized
just between having that beauty job and
how often I go through shampoo and
conditioner and my mom being a
hairdresser and like sending me stuff I
just feel like I don't ever purchase
stuff I just end up having it for
whatever reason so I did actually
enjoyed this in thought it was nice I do
feel like it took my color out a little
bit but also pink just fades a ton so oh
my gosh and then finally I have a
Moroccan oil in here which I feel like
isn't a project so maybe I shouldn't
mention it here yeah this should be in a
different video but I finished it a
coiler guess I should put that in that
product stuff I only three things left
this is the reach swaps I could not
think of the word floss for a while I
really like this specific floss I think
it's really good get out the dollar
or that's good this is a face
moisturizer from Olay and the micro
sculpting cream with sunscreen I got
this at Costco it was I think $30 and
you left two of the 1.7 ounces so I have
another one to go through this smells
like Garnier conditioner to me which is
a really nice scent but it just feels
weird to be putting it on my skin at
least at first I love that this has
sunscreen in it I do really like it I
don't think it makes me greasy
throughout the day I'm excited to use it
the other ones I potentially would
repurchase as I could definitely see
people enjoying it
I feel like it's a little bit expensive
for drugstore but I feel like a lot of
times the drugstore like Olay and Revlon
even those brands when it gets to
skincare they just are expensive so
thank you like that I would check out
Costco to see if they have it and the
last thing I have here is a sponge I got
this from actually from Dollface beauty
and I did really enjoy this this is hard
right now but when you wet it it turns
soft it has like this nice exfoliating
property that isn't too much it's not
too harsh but definitely can get rid of
some you know dry patches I get a lot of
dryness around my nose so I do really
like to use this there I've house-this
about four months now though and I think
it's just time to get rid of it and move
on to something else it's just getting
old so I'm going to be topping that out
I would repurchase
something like this though I do think
they work really nice and that is
everything guys I really hope you
enjoyed this empties video and enjoy
seeing all my trash I feel good about
the candles more than anything else I
feel like is miss empties and all the
makeup I guess I feel really good about
that - that's everything thank you so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
