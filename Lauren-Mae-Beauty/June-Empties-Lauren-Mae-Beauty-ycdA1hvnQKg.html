is going to be an empties video I'm not
even sure at this point if this is in
June's empties ormet's empties I think
it's kind of a mix of both I think I
skipped the month of May I just didn't
have enough stuff and then I just got
behind on top of that so I have quite a
few things to show you guys I feel like
I have quite a bit of makeup which is
awesome so we'll get into the makeup
items first this is all makeup empties
yeah so let's start off with the Urban
Decay perversion this is a travel size
mascara this is like my all-time
favorite mascara i absolutely love it i
will probably buy the full size i'm
gonna try to get as many little samples
as I can it's so good the wand on this
just seems kind of basic but it's so
good i just love this mascara if you're
interested in trying it i definitely
suggested i would definitely repurchase
next i have a foundation this is the
gorgeous cosmetics face perfect
foundation i have the color 0c i got
this as gratis when i was working at my
old job I do really like this foundation
I think it's really nice i think it has
good coverage for how lightweight it
feels it's really nice i would
definitely think about purchasing this
in the future if I got a good deal on it
like forty percent off or something it'd
definitely be worth it to me it's just
really good to have a lot of different
options for different skin tones and
different like undertones which is nice
although I feel like the numbering
system is kind of hard to deal with i
don't know i personally just like like
shade numbers like 1 2 3 or like when
they split them up between like warm
cool neutral and then do 1 2 3 that is
like the easiest for me anyway I really
did like this and I would definitely
consider it purchasing next is a primer
this is the Stila one step prime color
and kitten this was in my finished five
by Cinco de Mayo I believe I do quite
finish it in there and I basically just
ended up squeezing out the rest of this
into a tiny little sample jar I think I
maybe have one use left of that and just
getting rid of this because it was
getting so hard to squeeze it so this
product is done i'm so glad to use up
this year and not let it go to waste i
enjoyed this but i would not repurchase
it I'm just glad I
something that I like hated the whole
time and the last two things I have our
2 concealers this one is the Maybelline
fit me concealer and fair like holy
grail I love this I think it's so good I
would repurchase this for like ever I
just think it's so good it has great
coverage I feel like it looks like skin
it's just great and I love the color
fair I don't light is a little too dark
for me but fair is amazing and the other
concealer I have is the wet and wild
Illuminati highlight and concealing pen
I got the color I I bori into you I
don't like punny names that aren't like
good puns anyway this was okay I feel
like there wasn't a lot of product in it
I know this is only like I think it's
399 or something I just feel like the
fit me one's better and I feel like you
get probably about double the product
anyway so price-wise it's probably
pretty even this smells like paint
that's like the thing i don't like about
it just smells really cheap and i'm not
against like inexpensive products but i
don't want to just smell like i'm
putting like just horrible chemicals on
my face and that's kind of how this one
was so I my prime I tree purchase this
I'm not gonna lie if I was in a pinch or
something but it's definitely not my
favorite and I don't like a hundred
percent recommend it look if you really
wanted to try it okay it's not like
horrible it's just not like an amazing
amazing find or something now on to all
of the other random stuff in my empties
I used up yet another cotton pad this
one is from big lots i think these are
the crappy ones that i hate and if you
don't know what I'm talking about you
can watch my other empties and know that
I hate those ones I don't like them if
they don't have like a they're not like
in a little package if they're just like
loose cotton rounds then little fuzzies
go everywhere they're horrible so many
makeup wipes I go through so many wipes
because I keep these in my set bag I use
them myself so I have three of them here
these are the Appel wipes these are from
big lots they're a dollar each you
cannot beat the price you get 30 wipes
they don't sting my eyes I feel like
they smell nice and fresh they don't
break me out I just think they're great
i love how inexpensive these are but
that they're actually good and
use them myself so I feel like I am
totally fine if using that in my kit as
well I used up another one of the
Garnier micellar cleansing waters I
really like these i think you get a lot
of product i like the simple one i also
like bioderma i'm probably going to
repurchase this one not just because of
how large it is I feel like I can get a
couple months use out of these where I
feel like the simple one takes me like
about a month to go through I just think
this might be a little bit more cost
effective and I think it works really
well I don't find that it burns my eyes
but I will say all my seller waters no
matter which ones I've ever used if my
eyes are really tired and I can tell
that they're kind of like just dry or
just like worn out from the day
sometimes when i use in micellar water
it can burn a little bit but I feel like
that's just like my eyes and not the
actual product because on normal days it
doesn't burn anyway I really like this
and I will repurchase I finished up a
bath and body works body washes to see
coconut-lime breeze I wanted to use is
up because it's in the old packaging I
didn't really like the smell of this
which this is one of my favorite sends
it smells good my smell it here but like
when it was like heated up or something
I didn't I just wasn't as in love with
it as I used to be it's funny because
Sam whenever he'd smell the same was
like oh did you use that when we went to
Europe because right before we left for
Europe right after I graduated high
school i bought the coconut lime shampoo
and conditioner and so that's what we
use the whole time we were there so it's
like this weird scent memory to them he
was like remembering that time because
of this i did like this and i like this
scent but for whatever reason i didn't
love it as much as i remembered i don't
know that's like such a weird thing I
like Bath and Body Works shower gels
though I would repurchase we have a
couple hand soaps the first one here is
from Bath and Body Works this is the
kitchen lemon this was nice i like about
the Body Works hand soaps and kind of
moving away from them I just think
they're a little pricey and I know you
can get them on deals and all this stuff
but I don't know I kind of just want to
have like four hand soaps on hand at one
time instead of having like an insane
back stock which i think i only have two
right now which is crazy like I haven't
had only two hand soaps in probably
three years because I just always would
repurchase more and more and more and if
anything my count was going up and
instead up going down even with me using
them it was crazy the other one I have
is the Jasmine teakwood this is from
kroger
was really nice this isn't my type of
favorite scents like I enjoyed it but i
probably wouldn't repurchase this one
again i really like the guava line so
that's the one i think that i really
really like but i think a lot of people
would like this it smelt really nice and
for a dollar fifty you cannot beat it I
have a used bottle of witch hazel this
is what i use as a toner in my kit I
like to start off the skin I use this
toner and rub it over how's their skin
with a little wipe a little cotton round
and then I go in and like spray them
with like i mislike a toning miss on top
of that then I'd lotion and primer and
so on and so forth I really like it I
love the way witch hazel smells I used
to hate it but to me it smells like rain
like fresh rain and I really like that
scent I know a lot of people don't like
it but I think it smells really good
this is something that was actually sent
to me this is the v2 0 to M oxygen I'm
asked this came in a setup like six
pairs so in this little pack there were
two little eye patches they're very much
like the skin Iceland one so they go
like under the eye but these are
supposed to be kept on all night like
you keep these on all night and they're
supposed to be putting anti-aging and
hydrating it's supposed to frighten the
I just over i'll make you feel more
refreshed and hydrated underneath your
eye overall I did really like these i
think they worked nicely i love the gel
eye masks like this i think they just
feel so good if you've been crying or
you just had like a long night or you
just haven't got a lot of sleep they can
feel just so nice and refreshing under
the i personally this kind of like hurt
a little it just is a very cool has a
very cooling effect and I do kind of
have more sensitive skin so I felt like
with like the air blowing on me at night
and just a sensitive area of my face the
cooling effect being on longer than like
the 10 minutes or 20 minutes that I
usually leave it on kind of was
irritating me a little bit instead of
just being relaxing and refreshing but I
don't know if that's just me being
sensitive that could totally be it and
then the other thing though I just
didn't feel like for me I'm a tosser I'm
a Turner I'm like sleeping on my face so
I don't think these could stay on a
whole night sleep for me there's
no way they're gonna stick on there for
eight hours I did have to like replace
them so I put them on and then replace
them and that could have lost some of
the stickiness overall I think they're
really good but I'm still gonna only use
them for like 10 to 20 minute periods
and not overnight like they're supposed
to be I'll leave a link down below if
you guys want to check these out all
these links for everything but I do you
think they're good and I think that they
feel nice but i just want personally be
using them for eight hours on my eyes it
just my eyes can't handle it they're
just too sensitive and there i'm going
to stay on so I'd rather just enjoy 10
or 20 minutes and then move on and just
like reap the benefits of that much time
I have razors um we're gonna move past
cuz it's like not a big deal I'm
thinking about doing a different raising
thing I was contacted by a company and I
kind of want to try out their razor
system will see I'm not sure this is the
Elizabeth Arden face cream i got the SEC
costco it was in a pact with also with
the eye makeup remover and a travel size
and this was twenty dollars or nineteen
dollars this is 3.4 ounces and that's
why I was really excited I enjoyed this
I thought it worked well it smells gross
though it just smells like granny smells
like perfumes but not even good perfume
so Sam did not like the scent of this
either so I definitely don't think I'll
be repurchasing although I do think it
was a great deal for how much product
you're getting between the two of us me
and Sam use this in like a month and a
half so if you were using this on
yourself you'd probably get about three
months use out of it and I think that's
really good for twenty dollar night
cream that's going to be anti-aging i
just i did enjoy the texture and all
that it just the smell was just too much
so we just tried something else just a
few more things guys this is a two-piece
this is the Armand Hammer truly radiant
rejuvenating whitening toothpaste this
was okay I didn't really enjoy it I
don't know I just like the pool gate one
anyway this is a bath and Bodyworks
Wallflower I do like this I can't
remember the scent of this one I think
these are nice but I don't think you
need these and a candle especially if
you have a small apartment it's like
just do one or the other I don't think
you need to be wasting money in both
areas so i probably will give up the
wall flowers and just do candles in the
future i think they're nice but i just
have two small of an apartment if i had
like a bigger house or like a guest room
or something like that I'd want them but
Sam is pretty sensitive to
so I find that he just irritated by them
if they're constantly burning instead of
it being a candle where I can kind of
choose when it smells good and when it
doesn't this is another floss this is
the reach mint waxed floss is what i use
i guess at the dollar store or anywhere
where it's a dollar I don't spend over
at all around flossing because it's just
too expensive and then this is a small
little size of the jane iredale hand
drink spf15 hand lotion I really like
this it feels really nice it sinks into
the skin really fast I love that it has
SPF because it's protecting your hands
from the Sun so if you're driving or
just doing things out in the day I think
it's a really nice hand cream on the go
I don't know if I'm gonna repurchase
because I do like a ton of hand creams
but this is a really good one if you
were wondering or interested that is
everything for my empties video I hope
you guys enjoyed I think me and Sam
we're gonna film a tag together after
this I don't think we're gonna do the
boyfriend-girlfriend or like married
he's my husband but I don't think we're
gonna do that tag yet I did have a
request for it so i will do it in the
future but i thought it'd be fun to do
like a travel tagger just something else
I don't know we'll see I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day again and I
will see you in the next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
