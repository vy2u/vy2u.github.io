is going to be my june gratis video now
just to explain again i have done one of
these before but when you work in the
beauty industry you do get a lot of free
product because brains are coming in and
training you and then they want you to
try out their product so that you can
kind of give your own feedback to
customers and potentially I mean they
want you to sell that product so if you
love it and you're converted to the
product then you're going to sell more
of it kind of is the whole idea so lots
of brands give you a free product to try
it out and to love so that you can let
other people know about how awesome I
products are that being said none of
this stuff was purchased by myself but I
did get it for free from work not
through YouTube or anything with my
channel I just like to show you guys
some of the products that I'm using or
in my collection at the moment and also
if you guys want reviews or more
in-depth like information or anything
like that on any of these products you
can always let me know in the comments
and I can do a whole video dedicated to
that for you guys I know it seems like I
just did a gratis video which I kind of
did but I did that really late in May so
I'm kind of trying to get on track with
doing them monthly and it didn't want
tab like a big gap in between so this is
going to be for june and then at the end
of july i'll do it for july and so on
and so forth so we will be on track now
hopefully that's okay again this isn't
me trying to bribe just thought I'd
throw it out there I really am just kind
of showing you guys hauling this stuff
showing you what's in my collection and
again if you want any information or
reviews or anything like that on these
products let me know in the comments
down below and I can do that for you
let's get into this stuff so I really
recently went to a training with me rad
and so I got quite a bit of product and
I mean just first off I got this bag
from your ad and inside is like a
painting that dr. Murad painted himself
um me ride I I really didn't know that
much about Mara before going to the
training but just to give you a little
insight their whole philosophy is about
feeling better every day getting better
every
day and they're also and all about all
inclusive health so it's not just what
you're putting on your face it's how
you're living it's what you're putting
into your body like with what you're
eating so they're about health overall
which i think is really awesome so let
me show you the products this is a newer
product I believe this is the rapid
collagen infusion for lips this is a
treatment that goes on your lips it
helps to fill in any vertical lines you
may have pluck the lips and reap remote
collagen yeah it's a part of their
number two which is there treat and
repair so they have a number system one
is cleanse and tone 2 is treating repair
3 is moisturize and protect so this is
kind of like the treatment part of it
and I'm excited to use this i'm not sure
if i'm going to give this to my mom or
keep it for myself but i heard really
good things about it that's something
you only want to use like twice a day to
if you use it too much it's like to
moisturizing for your lips I know that
sounds weird but the others full text
product I got is this me rod one this is
the rapid age spot and pigment
lightening serum this is kind of a
controversial item but it's also the
number one bestseller this has it's used
to get rid of any dark spots and we have
on your face and it does work really
well that's why it's such a popular item
so yeah I got this and then the rest of
the stuff for me rod are actual samples
this is a deluxe size of the rapid
collagen infusion this is basically what
the lip one is but for your face it's
supposed to help fill and plump and make
you look more youthful I got two of the
minis for the invisible er perfecting
shield this is an SPF 30 it's an
invisible sunscreen it's the first
fda-approved invisible sunscreen on the
market and it also has like a soft focus
effect and it's kind of like a
one-and-done product it's going to boise
tries and if you're selling you doesn't
want to bother with like a huge routine
you could just put this on your face and
be done you don't have to feel like
moisturizer and everything if you didn't
want to obviously you do you these are
new products from UROD this is the
rejuvenating
a hand cream I got three of the minis of
them so it's really nice a little bit
goes a long way with that product I
haven't tested to that long term but
when i was trying it it felt really nice
I'm not that I need any more hand creams
trust me I have way too many this is a
new product as well this is a deluxe a
sample of the toxify I cannot say that
word detoxifying white clay body
cleanser mmm I've heard it's good i've
heard it phones really well so we shall
see and then i have too many but i like
one with me this one is the skin
smoothing polish this is a number one a
cleanse and tone holy cow that was loud
it's like a scrub for your face and then
i also got the acne fast fix spot
couldn't like spot treatment and I use
that last night because I'm breaking out
so much like I have been since I moved
here so that is in my bathroom so I'm
sorry it's not here I apologize but it's
just a little deluxe size but it's gonna
last forever so that's all this is
Avenged cold cream body lotion this was
actually a tester and we just read put
the tester out because it got a little
faded from the Sun that's all so
nothing's wrong with it but i thought i
would try it out it's just a body lotion
event known for really soothing products
that are great for people that have any
like skin conditions rosacea sensitive
skin redness anything like that this
would be a great just line in general so
this is going to be a probably a really
just simple sensitive hydrating body
lotion I don't have to too much more so
that's awesome this is a sunscreen from
dermalogica this is the protection 50
sport it's an SPF 50 and that's all it
it's a nice thin formula its water
resistant up to 40 minutes but you
always want to reapply sunscreen every
two hours to protect yourself from the
Sun and I believe this is a chemical
sunscreen it's not like a a mineral
sunscreen so that's that like the
full-size I'm happy too because I think
Sam would love to use that when he's
like hiking or doing things like that
the rest of the product that i have in
bass guitar from nicks and then I do
have something I forgot to show in the
last video so Nick's came and they gave
us a couple products this is a new
product from them this is the shower oil
with golden shimmer I'm excited to try
this because everyone loves the locks of
Tom one which i have a small sample of
and I haven't used it but um I'm not
someone who moisturizes my body a lot so
I'm really excited to try an oil in my
shower and give myself moisture without
the hassle of putting moisturizer on
after I get out of the shower and I
believe this is going to have like a
honey scent but I'm excited to try that
one out that's actually something I'm
gonna like I'm looking forward to try
this is the nukes multi-purpose dry oil
for face body or hair it is the one with
the shimmer in it I am a little nervous
to try this product I'm not someone who
liked Ann's or does any of that type of
stuff so um I don't know we'll see i
might just save this and give it to
someone else or i don't i don't know i
might pass it along but i kind of want
to try it but I kind of don't think i
will use it either at the same time so
that and that's like the mini version
and then this is also a newer product
for nukes and this is the detox serum
and this is supposed to like go on the
skin and detoxify yourselves of sugar
and kind of restore the cell so that
when they're when you're sleeping and
they're repairing themselves they're
like when they multiply because
yourselves are multiplying you are
multiplying cells that are detoxified
instead of cells that have all these
toxins in them yeah that's what it's
supposed to do it is a night serum and
it's supposed to make you also look like
you've had two extra hours of sleep so
I'm kind of using this thing how it
works if you want to review again on any
of the stuff let me know who or even
just like a product knowledge or
something like that like let me know I
would love to be able to pass on any
information I get to you guys I would
love to do that the last item is this
briefcase and I know it looks kind of
crazy but let me open it for you guys so
this is actually like a glitter kit it's
a tattoo glitter kit
my boss gave this to me because we don't
sell this anymore and it was just under
her desk and you don't want it so I
thought this would be fun for my kit and
just to have if someone wanted this or I
could use the blue or I could even if I
just use the glitters that would be
awesome so yeah I'm going into high
fashion next class so I thought this
would be come in handy doing a high
fashion stuff for my face or just
different things so that is everything
that I got I am super lucky to get to
try all these things out and um yeah I
realized that and I do love the fact
that my job is in the beauty industry
because it's something I'm so passionate
about let me know if you've tried any of
these items and you love them or if you
don't like them or if you again I've
said like three times but if you want to
review on anything of course guys just
let me know I believe that's everything
I will see you guys in my next video
have a wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
