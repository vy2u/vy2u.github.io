is going to be a updated makeup basket
now I was doing these bi-weekly but
honestly some starting work I have not
been using makeup as much as I thought I
would so I'm gonna go through the
drawers and I'm gonna start doing these
monthly just because with my job again
I'm not changing out my makeup and I'm
not going to do bi-weekly makeup baskets
of the same products over and over so
some of these are repeats some of these
I'm trying to get through and some of
them are new i have switched out a lot
of the color products so that it can be
trying out different things in my
collection will start with this guy now
these are all products that don't fit
into the container that's they sit on
top of here the first thing i have here
is mac fix+ i use this to foil shadows
or if I think my makeups getting kk next
I have my favorite drugstore foundation
this is number seven beautiful i'm at
this isn't cool vanilla i absolutely
love this foundation and i mix it
usually with these other two or wear it
alone but most time i mix it with one or
two of these other foundations that i'm
going to show you this is where most BB
cream in Matt this is the light one I
really like this it's in my top five
drugstore based products which I'll link
down below this is a mary kay timewise
matt where liquid foundation now this
isn't a color ivory for and it's very
light so i like to mix it with the other
ones just to kind of lighten up the look
I'm really just trying to get through
this product that's why it's in here and
then same with this this was in my
finished 7 by spring but it did not get
finished this is the physicians formula
organic where light to neutral tinted
moisturizer I am so close to being done
with this so I'm just trying to put this
in my foundation every day to try to get
it used up I'm really trying hard I also
have this Maybelline matte powder this
is just a loose powder in 01 light I got
this on a really good deal and I'm just
trying to get good use out of it and use
it up so that's what I'm doing right now
i'm using this benefit primer right now
to prime my face because I used up my
baby skin one which I'm so happy about I
wanted to use it to primers this year by
the end of the year and I've already
used up one so this is the next one I'm
working on I don't like it but I'm going
to use it and get my money's worth now
on to the drawers this is drawer one and
here I have a pallet this is lorac
unzipped gold that's what it looks like
I just haven't gotten any use out of
this since i bought it and i really
wanted to use it so this is really like
the big palette i'm using right now i
have 2 concealers this is the maybelline
dream lumi i like to use this underneath
my eyes and then this is the Maybelline
fit me concealer and I use this to spot
conceal I'm almost done with both of
these so I'm just kind of sticking to
those and I'll move on as I use them up
this is a point concealer my mom gave me
because she didn't like it this is in
the 01 color I use this to spot conceal
or anything i feel like i'm having
problems with so i just like to keep it
in there this is my Rimmel stay matte
powder i am getting close to finishing
this i need to repress it because it's
starting to kind of break apart but i
really like this powder i'm just trying
to work through it this is my pixie
flawless and poreless this is a primer I
need to just use it up but I haven't and
I'm probably not going to take it out
until I force myself to use it this is a
bare minerals little bisque concealer
powder concealer again with this I
haven't really made any more progress on
it I need to use it but I haven't and
then I have an eye primer in here this
is Laura behind the scenes I just have
this in here in case I want to use just
a normal eye primer instead of like a
shimmery base that's it that's all
that's in this drawer nothing much i'm
really trying to keep it kind of simple
right now especially with face and base
products because i just want to get it I
want to get going you know in the
mornings I already wake up so early so
this is drawer number two this is all of
my face products that are color
cosmetics so bronzers highlighters and
blushes I have two from Laura Mercier so
this one here is the one I probably
gotten the most use out of let me show
you what it looks like so pretty this is
in the color Bora Bora it's like a light
peachy color I really like that I've
been using it basically every day this
is another one this is in the color
sugar-free blush and brighten in the
color boysenberry I don't know why the
lighting is so horrible I'm so sorry
guys this one's really pretty it's like
a darker mavi color I thought it'd be
nice I have used this one so far and it
is really dark out to be careful and
then I thought I'd bring out like an
oldie but a goodie this is Rimmel
lasting finish blush in santa rosa
Santa rose and I feel like everyone love
this blush these were discontinued and I
thought I'd bring it out and try to use
it for bronzers I have like three things
kind of this is Sephora as bronzer in
Seoul del Rio this was limited edition
it's just a great matte bronzer I really
like it i'm glad i got it they do have
like big round discs out now not in that
color I believe but they are out at
sephora limited edition for this year
this is my bronzer from to fees from my
finish by by Cinco de Mayo I'm still
working on it still trying to use it up
so it's going to stay in there probably
until it's gone this is Smashbox is
contour kit I just put this in my gratis
video so I'll link that down below but
it has a contour bronzer a nap mat
highlight that one's really nice I've
really been using that to contour lately
this is the highlighter I've been loving
you can see a decent dip there this is
the love affair by bare minerals so I've
been really liking that for a more I
guess natural highlight since it's not
super frosting this is the third drawer
I'm just gonna breeze through that I
have some nude sticks here this one's in
the color spirit and this one's in the
color moon I just got these i'm trying
to play with them and use those I'm
keeping my color pop in there this has
been in there for forever but I'm
keeping it in there because I want to
use it this is my tart cream eyeshadow
in shimmering golden beige I'm still
using that every day I pop this starlix
brow quad in here as well because I
really wanted to use it up I was it

highlighter in there this is just a mini
size of it I have three of two-faced
single eyeshadows in here this color is
sitcom siren the color temper temper
which is like a burgundy color and then
this is the color nude swings it's just
like a shimmery color I just thought I'd
get some use out of those I picked up
some of the wet and wild eyeshadow six
pans from the I think it's the silver
light collection I put those in there
because I might want to use them and
then I also have this quad from
Maybelline that is in the color violet
violet volt so those are the eyeshadows
i'm working with including the palette
this fourth drawer is kind of
saying I'm gonna go through it so fast

color which is baked I have a knicks
colored mascara here in the color
forget-me-nots I have five of these

really like that I use it on days when I
know I'm going to makeup school and I
don't need anything and then I have
honest osseous clear brow gel as well so
lots of stuff in this drawer but
honestly um you know I use most of the
same things and then there's just fun
things in there just in case so last but
not least I have my bottom drawer which
is mostly lip stuff so you know I don't
wear lip stuff all the time but we'll go
through it this is just a sharpener from

this really pretty color in heat wave

but that's what it looks like it's just
a really pretty everyday color this is
Kate Moss rimmel london lipstick i got
it's a really crazy color this is in the
color 33 I don't really like it so i'll
probably be passing that along the
