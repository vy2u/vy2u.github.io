Lauren I am filming the same day that I
filmed my red eyeshadow tutorial it's
just later in the day I had plans to
meet a friend for coffee and so I phone
that tutorial and now I'm back later
part of the day and ready to film the
rest of my videos that i had scheduled
so that being said if my makeup looks a
little off it's because I've been
wearing it all day and I had glasses on
earlier so don't be too harsh just refer
back to the first video anyway let's get
into my June favorites I do my favorites
videos a little bit different I pick
five products that were my top five
favorites for the month I've really been
trying not to spend a lot of money on
makeup so I'm not constantly bringing in
a ton of new products to tell you guys
about so and because of that I think
five items that I've just really been
loving whether they're new or old or
just loves of mine I think is enough
products you know so let's just get into
my favorites the first product I have
here is my pure minerals four-in-one
powder foundation and I think I might
have mentioned this in my January
favorites but it's just a favorite I do
really like this powder this is how much
I have left nothing because I use it a
ton it's what I'm wearing today and it's
what I've been wearing a lot of June
I've really been enjoying just like
concealer all over the face to conceal
some heavier redness or blemishes and
then going on top of that with a more
full coverage powder I just have really
been liking the look of that it feels
less heavy on the skin I ouch it's
easier in the morning basically I've
just been enjoying it I will say it does
not keep me Matt throughout the day that
is not at all a claim of it but I do
kind of like it an hour in or so it just
really melds into the face looks like
skin looks really natural but then like
an hour later it's like boo greasy so
I'm not saying this one is like my
absolute favorite I do really enjoy it i
think i will try different ones once i
finish this and once I finished the tart
one I have but just in general powder
foundations I just think they're good i
don't think they talked about two two
much here on youtube I feel like mineral
things are kind of left to either
newbies or maybe more mature skin or
people who have a more simple routine
but they are really nice products and
I've been really like
the next favorite I wanted to mention
was sent to me from Influenster this is
the Marc Jacobs glow stick and spotlight
I feel mixed about the packaging on this
when you just look at it like this it
looks super cute but when you open it up
it just looks like a deodorant or
something I feel like it's a little bit
cheap and my product specifically came a
little busted i mean i've used it so
it's a little dented for me but I just
felt like it didn't look it crazy
expensive like it actually is I don't
know that's me being very particular but
if you're going to spend a lot of money
I think presentation is a really big
factor in it other than that though the
product itself is really really nice you
are supposed to use a brush specifically
like put it on here and then apply with
a brush and that's why I've been doing
it and I've really been liking it I
personally feel like a little of this
goes a long way you do not need to like
really build this up I feel like this
gives you a really either natural dewy
look or it can kind of give you almost a
wet look I just really like it I think
it's a good color I'll swatch it for you
guys that's it there it's a heavy swatch
overall I just think it's nice what I
pay like the 40-something dollars that
this is not entirely sure but I am
enjoying it and if you were looking into
getting it I definitely would suggest
watching it and if it's in your budget
and it's something you're interested in
it is really nice now from really
expensive let's go to something entirely
dirt cheap this is an eyebrow pencil I
got this off of ebay this is the brand
fairy girl it's an eyebrow pencil in the
shade 02 I believe it's called Blake
coffee this was like 70 something since
on ebay so cheap what I particularly
love about this is the shape of the
pencil I had a its skin babies baby face
something like that it's an asian brand
and it's pencil was also shaped in this
way and I just really find that I can do
a whole eyebrow with this without using
other products and can get a pretty
sculpted look if I take my time and you
know focus on my eyebrows and not give
up look I've mentioned it to you guys
before I personally have a different
day every single day but the other day I
did my eyebrows with this and they
looked sharp I was so happy with it so I
really like this I feel like the price
you cannot be but specifically again
kind of like a powder foundation I'd
really like the shape of this eyebrow
pencil I feel like it can do both it can
do a more fine-tipped tail but it can
also fill in the front of the eyebrow
really well because you can turn it to
its side it's just really nice and you
can maneuver it and like manipulate it
in the way that you need and I really
been enjoying it + 75 cents what girl
what my last makeup favorite are the
makeup geek duo calm foiled I shadows I
picked up five of them when i was at
Fame expo I will leave my haul video
down below and I will also leave my
swatch video down below as well if you
follow me on instagram you also saw a
picture that i posted there so I
definitely have some content referring
to these if you want to check it out I
feel like the pigmentation all these is
really beautiful they definitely have a
high metallic finish and they also have
a really nice shiny duochrome when you
get them in the light I definitely don't
think that any of the camera does it
justice natural lighting I feel like
looks the best but in person you can
definitely see the duochrome in these
shadows the one thing that I don't like
about these shadows as they are quite
crumbly specifically my wildfire is very
crumbly I got these at fame X so like I
said so they didn't come shipped to me
or anything I got to pick them up in
person but I did see on a post of makeup
geek when they were trying to sell these
after fam Expo because they still had
some left over I saw people in the
comments saying that a lot of theirs
came broken and I am NOT surprised these
definitely resemble the texture and
consistency of the first foiled makeup
geek shadows they easily can crack they
easily can break I definitely feel like
they need to be pressed harder or have
more like some type of binder to them
just having this in my Z palette and
like I'm not throwing it around or
anything this one has lost a little bit
of shadow from it so that's definitely a
negative I really hope that they
reformulate these and come out with a
better presta version of these but i
will say pigmentation wise they still
perform really well I definitely think
that's a flaw and that needs to be fixed
and I think that might be a reason why
you can't get them anymore I'm not sure
they sold out or if they pulled them
because of people having issues but
other than that issue color wise and
performance wise I think that they're
really really beautiful and my last
favorite my fifth favorite for June
would be supernatural I have climbed on
the supernatural fandom bandwagon and an
obsessed with this show basically since
Ann's been off of work due to his injury
I took it upon myself to be like we're
gonna start supernatural and we are in
season four I believe and there are 10
seasons on netflix and i believe there's
12 seasons in total and it's still going
and i'm so excited it's a really good
show it's about let me rephrase that i
enjoy the show I don't think it's
everyone's cup of tea it can be a little
cheesy at times it's very similar to X
Files in a way but a little bit more
like teenager friendly a little more
love interest more attractive people
like young attractive men so yeah and
young as in like not like babies you
know anyway I really enjoyed this show
and I really been obsessed with it and
when I was coming up with this list I
was like what are my favorites this
month that Sam was like supernatural I
was like it's already on the list so it
definitely deserves a spot here but
those are all my favorites everything
will be linked down below if you want to
check anything out and that's everything
I will see you guys in my next video hi
