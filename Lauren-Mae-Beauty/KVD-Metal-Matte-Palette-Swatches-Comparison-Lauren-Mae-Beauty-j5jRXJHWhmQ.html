Lauren sorry about my voice once again
we went to Disneyland because we are
annual passholders now and I just had
too much fun and scream too much and now
my voice is like missing this video is
going to be just a review / swatch video
of the kat von d metal matte palette so
i got this in the mail last night that's
what I came in this is what it looks
like it is a monster it's so massive the
box that I came in basically looks
exactly the same and as you can tell kat
von d made this so it looks like matt
when you have it this way and it looks
like metal when you have it that way
really awesome packaging i really love
that she takes so much time on her
packaging and then let's open it and see
what's inside cuz that's what's
important this is an eyeshadow palette
that has metal shades what she considers
medal shades on top and matte shades on
the bottom in total this palette has 22
different eyeshadow shades and there are
arranged from neutrals too colorful
shadows a really great spectrum of
different colors in this palette the
review part of this is going to be a
little bit short only because I've only
used them today on my eyes I use the
colors ignite this color here which is
tinsel the matte color stone and then
the color suede and bone and suede is my
transition i also used one on the lower
lash line I really did enjoy how these
colors applied I really got no fallout
it's like hard to fit this even in my
screen so Oh forgive how weird this is
but I thought that these worked out
really really well and the only shade
that I kind of had some issues with is
the color tinsel now it's a beautiful
shade when you swatch it on your finger
and if you swatch it on your arm but I
do find that picking it up with a brush
is a little bit tricky just because it's
a little bit chunky and it's not that it
has glitter in it because
none of these have like glitter which is
amazing
it's just however it is it's almost like
a flakey shadow that needs the pressure
of your finger to kind of smooth out
into a really pretty shadow so I find
its watches really well I do really like
the color but I feel like it's best used
with your finger and applied with your
finger or you potentially could get
better luck with it with like a flat
synthetic shader brush but for that one
I probably will just stick to using my
fingers with it other than that these
shadows are super buttery they swatch
very nicely I'm very happy with them and
something i like is that they aren't
overly heavy like when you go in to pick
up product I don't feel like you're
getting like a really big coating on
your hand it's it feels almost kind of
thin but it still has great pigmentation
so I'm really happy with the quality of
this I'm super glad that I got it I
think that the colors are just really
nice and I kind of went out of the box
today using the blue shades just because
I really wanted to you know go out of my
comfort zone I really do usually
gravitate to more on this side of the
palette so I wanted to just see how
shadows I don't really wear look um I
was actually really surprised with the
color wat just because I feel like jewel
tone shadow sometimes cannot be actually
Joel town once you put them on and kind
of blend them out they can almost look
black and I really like that this did
stay that teal color even as it kind of
blended out I was just kind of surprised
on that if you've used other drill tons
before you kind of know what I'm saying
I feel like they kind of just look muddy
and just dark and not like rich and
jewel toned so I was really happy with
that again she does a great job of
including like Matt blacks matt white
matte crease colors and brow bones I do
think that the color bone and white are
very similar I wish that bone was just
like a shade down but that's just me
being picky overall I do really like
this palette I think it's really nice I
think the quality is really great for
the price I think you're getting a lot
of different variation and i love that
it has mats and like shimmer shades I
thought that I would grab the other
palette so this is what this palette
looks like this is the metal mat and
then
this is last year's palette which is the
me vida loca remix so if I can possibly
hold these bolt up I will so that's what
they look like side by side I feel like
this one definitely has more of the like
color wheel kind of thing going a lot
more slick so awkward um a lot more of
those like brighter shades and this is a
little more subdued it looks a little
more fall it looks a little bit more
almost muddy but not in a bad way so I
definitely think that these could go
well together I don't think that you're
getting a ton of like repeat shades the
neutral part I feel like you know
potentially is similar there is a matte
black in here but there is not i'm not
white so overall i don't think they're
like entirely like dupes of each other
or anything but i thought i would hold
them up just so you guys could see them
next to each other I feel like if you
love Kat Von D shadows you're definitely
going to like this palette I think it
has a lot to offer especially if you're
not afraid of color if you want
something neutral this probably isn't
for you because most of these are
colorful shadows even though these are
colorful they can be used as like
neutrals are at least to me there's
definitely some fun pops of color to
play with and I really like that if you
think you might want this palette I
definitely suggest kind of getting a
sooner rather than later only because I
find that these do sell out I know a lot
of people didn't get their hands on the
holiday palette from her last year and I
feel like she just always sells out so
definitely see what you have in your
collection if this is something for you
and if you do want it I would definitely
suggest getting it before it sells out
other than that I can't wait to explore
more with this palette i'll probably do
a four looks one palette using this
let's get into swatches and then you
guys can decide if this is a palette for
you or not
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
