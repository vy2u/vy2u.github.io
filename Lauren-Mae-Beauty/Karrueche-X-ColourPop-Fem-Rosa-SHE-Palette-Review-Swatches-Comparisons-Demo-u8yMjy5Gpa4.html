to learn thank you so much for watching
and sitting up with my squeaky voice I'm
just really comfortable today I wanted
to get this video filmed because they
are restocking this pallet let me talk
about the pallet maybe this is going to
be a video talking all about the femme
Rosa palette the Shi palette from
colour-pop this is part of the Karrueche
collection and this is what it looks
like it's very similar to the yesplease
palette that they recently came out with
they are restocking this on Thursday at
10:00 a.m. the 20th so if you want it
that is going to be the time to get it
and I wanted to have this video up you
guys can decide it's something that you
must have is it something that you want
to pass on I don't mind so fast compared
especially to the other palette this
shipped out I want to say either the day
after I ordered or maybe two days after
and I was expecting way longer so I have
used this twice I believe including
today which I do have a demo at the end
of the video this isn't going to be an
insanely thorough review because they
haven't had a ton of time to you know
use it watch it I kind of already have
some thoughts on it but heather from
love Heatherette requested that i kind
of do some comparisons between this and
the Valentine's Day collection shadows
that came out during Valentine's Day
from colour-pop so I am going to be kind
of comparing these or showing you the
most similar shades that have to some of
these shadows in my other palette so I
have the yesplease palette and then I
also have a self-made palette here that
I just have bought shadows from so
anything that it happens similar I'm
going to swatch them next to each other
as I talk about it so you guys can get
an idea of what you need and what you
don't need
I believe that's everything let's get
into the review so if you haven't seen
it this is what the palette looks like
it is very warm toned but more on the
rosy purple side whereas the yesplease
palette was warm but more on the orange
--red yellow side i'll show you guys a
side-by-side comparison real fast those
are the two palettes side by side now
they are going to look a bit different
to you because they are not on the same
background and color is relative so that
is something that's kind of hard to tell
this is on a pink background obviously
this is on like a light grey so it's
kind of hard to tell how someone things
are just by looking
mr. retails for $16 you guys know that
you get 12 different shades it has all
the shade names listed on the back and I
believe these are all 100% me shadows
where the yes we palette has two that
were already permanent in the collection
personally I like this palette but I
don't think it's a must-have
especially not when you compare it to
the yes please palette I definitely
prefer that palette over it for color
selection for creating cohesive looks
you can create so many different looks
about palette wares I feel like so many
of these are going to come out very
similar the first two rows here all are
very similar shadows and I feel like
they swatch out very similarly now I am
of a lighter skin tones and maybe a
deeper skin tones these will show up
differently or on medium skin tones but
for me and what I need in the palette
it's just missing a lot these are kind
of dark transition colors for me and
they're all colorful which I like color
but again it's just definitely not a
standalone palette it's definitely
something I would use you know one or
two shades out of and then use other
things to create a comprehensive look
except for today because I only use this
palette on my eyes today another thing
that I noticed off the bat was that my
tans in here can like move around which
I thought was really strange because
they did not have that issue with the
yesplease palette so I don't know I
don't know why that is I don't know I
don't know if these are just magnetized
in or if they're glued in and the glooms
loose but that was just something I
wanted to note also in here there are
only four matte shades the rest are part
of the satin or metallic finishes and
you know I'm glad that they have formats
it's still a third of the palette which
is great I just wish we had a little bit
more color selection when it comes to
d-max or if we're going to have all
these in talents that they were just
more different than each other I think
if you look at the pictures on the
colour-pop Instagram you can tell that a
lot of these colors swapped out very
similarly and overall quality wise I do
think that is like kind of normal color
pop style quality so I'm happy with the
quality except for this shade here I do
not like this one I believe it's the
colored gal it is a pretty shade
nonetheless but it's very glittery it
almost has a do come to it but it's kind
of flaky it's not going to
as well as the other shades and you will
need a sticky base or fix+ or something
to really get that to look opaque and
beautiful on the eye
plus I do believe there's going to be
fallout with it I just don't understand
how there couldn't be because there is
definite glitter in it those are kind of
my thoughts if you wanted to know I do
suggest the yes please palette over this
one I just you know I've said it a
million times already but I just prefer
the shadows in here I love that I'm so
dirty though I do think that they got
that right about the salad though this
is not going to show dirt nearly as much
as this palette but I just I like the
colors in here more I can just do a
better look with it again that being
said that does not mean that this isn't
necessarily good quality or that I
regret purchasing this I just prefer the
other ones better and I just think I'd
like it more than I actually do if these
are colors that really sing to you if
this is your style these your colors you
wear everyday you will probably really
love this palette and again I do think
that the price is just such a good price
point for what you're getting and
packaging it's super cute I really like
this not only for the color in it
getting dirty but just in general I
think it just has more personality I'm
going to swatch the palette for you guys
now so you guys can see what these
shadows look like and swatch out and
like a live swatch you guys know how i
do my swatches and then we will move
into some of the dupes that i feel like
are very similar or pretty close or just
to give you an idea of how they compare
to other shadows in the color pop range
and if they're close enough that you
feel like you don't need it or if
they're different enough that you feel
like you can justify having cool
okay sorry about that I don't know where
I was I just got a call for a job so
that's exciting but moving on to I think
we were just starting on color duped
so the first sheet in the palette lady
like I did not find anything from the
color pop colors that I have that was
similar to that next we have the color
babe in the palette and I did find some
kind of similar dupes to that one the
first one is actually from the
Valentine's Day collection this is você
já and although they're not exact they
are very similar and then the next one I
have is from the new summer collection
this is ready or yacht and this one's a
little bit more peach instead of pink
but I don't know I wanted to include it
just so you could have an idea of what
they all would like together the next
two shades in the palette are dainty and
chick and I didn't find anything that
that close to them although I will say
dainty and the color filly which is also
in a palette to me are very similar like
they're very very similar so they almost
do peach other and they're in the same
palette and not something I just ran
across with is it's just like on the lid
how different are these going to look
for them to be in the same palette like
I get that they go together because
they're very similar but I want variety
not just the same variation of the same
shadow that color was actually called
Mademoiselle and not silly
sorry about that but Mademoiselle also
has another dip to it besides the color
dainty in the palette and it is
high-strung again these are going to be
exactly so I'm just giving you an idea
of what you might have that similar from
their range
so obviously the Mademoiselle is a bit
more red but I feel like they're very
similar and personally I like high
strength better the next color gal is
the one that's my least favorite in the
palette again it's that like duochrome
glittery shade I don't have a dupe for
it and thank goodness because I don't
want to do for it
we have the color Empress which is this
nice purplish shade and I do have a
similar color again from the Valentine's
Day collection and that is the color
double date this one is a bit more
purple but again depending on what you
like to wear they are very similar and
potentially give you a very similar look
the next shade in the palette is
actually the color filly and that's this
red shimmer on the side I'm gonna break
something today this one is really
really pretty and then the color that I
have that kind of dupes it again it's
from a Valentine's Day collection
Heather would like pretty spot on with
it being very similar to that and that
is the color of pinkie promise so
obviously pinky promise is more purple
but I did have another dupe for this one
and that actually comes from the
yesplease palette this sheet here bling
is very similar to has that same red
tone to it it's actually a better dupe
I'd say than the double date so that's
it they're a little bit more Brown I
guess you could say where this one has
orange but I'm very similar you're
moving on to the last round the palette
this is the first shade here dear and I
do have one kind of I guess similar
color to it they are both matte and the
color that I think is very similar is
the shade flower voice from colour-pop
again I believe this is from the
Valentine's Day collection which would
make sense again with the name this one
on top is a little bit more orange coral
where this one has a little bit more
pink but again they are very very
similar
next in the palette we have the shade
Missy and I do have something less
similar but again some of these aren't
super close so this one's just a nice
matte red and the similar color comes
from the yes please palette as well and
this is the color spoiled this is
definitely more of an actual red as
opposed to more of a purple red these
aren't obviously super similar but I
think on the eye that can translate
pretty similarly and if you just wanted
to know how close they were here is a
comparison the next shade is the darkest
shade in the palette and it is damsel I
really didn't have anything that quite
compared to this so I just decided to
show you a comparison against the
darkest color in the yes please palette
this one is a brown and this one is a
purple but I thought
might as well just show you I don't know
totally different I don't really know
why this is I were coming up with this
list kind of late last night Samina and
I was just thinking right now in case
you wanted a comparison of that color
with the color one for three because I
did just order that one they are not
similar at all
one for three is way brighter of a
purple so they are not comparable at all
nothing compares to that color
and for the last shadow in the palette
my goodness can we make it this one here
is the color Dutchess and it's a nice
like orange color and the color that is
the most similar to it is in my
yesplease palette I believe I like to
picked out one dupe for it let's see oh
no I have to I think that flower boy is
also very similar to this again it's a
little bit more pink but definitely and
you know some similarities it's in the
same boat just as a comparison and then
the shade in the yesplease palette is
the color big cocktails and it's this
orange here now this does have been more
orange to it but again I thought I would
just give you a comparison in case you
were wondering what they look like next
to each other I hope that you enjoyed
this video I hope it was at all helpful
in any way at all whatsoever we will get
into the demo now and I give a similar
out sort of that there but I hope you
enjoyed the video and if you want to
stay tuned to the demo it's going to
start now hey guys we're going to start
the demo portion of this video you'll
already know that we're using the SEM
Rosa palette which is the she palette
it's kind of weird they give each of
these palettes like two names so it's
kind of hard to decide what the heck's
going on but I want to do an entire eye
look using this palette today so
hopefully we'll figure something out
that will be good before I do that
though I am going to do my eyebrows
really fast so I'm going to sketch this
on and we'll come back I just did a
pretty light fill in and then I'm going
to go into the new product this is the
black cup fixture source SILS invisible
also known as the invisible eyebrow
fixer I think that was the French
version which would make sense with
these when come on I usually use this is
just clear though and it will definitely
keep it very natural since I'm not
adding any more color I'm just adding a
little bit of hold and I'm just brushing
up
I sound like a crocodile because I
haven't talked about much in today and
my voice is like ruff
alright let's serve on I've already
primed my eyes I did not set it with a
face but it has been a second so I'm
hoping that's been enough time for it to
not be too sticky there is not like a
light cream matte shade in this palette
so I guess I'm just going to go in first
with this shade here which is Duchess
I'm going to do something with the
oranges and reds not that there's much
else as an option in this palette you
guys are to know my thoughts on the
palette because I've already filmed the
review well I haven't but in the future
what you guys see you'll see my thought
it's not that I don't like this palette
it's just definitely not a standalone
palette to me now that I have a little
bit of the crease blended in I'm going
to go on with the pink shade I'm
probably going to use honestly all the
mess and I'm just going to be focusing
this a little bit lower than the orange
because we're going to work in the red
mix and I think it'll be a nice
transition on my lid today I know it's
going to be kind of boring but I'm going
to be using the first shade ladylike
it's so pretty this is probably one of
my favorite shades it's so just it just
well it called it a metallic but to me
it's kind of a satin it doesn't quite
look like metallic but it's so bright
and so pigmented which i think will be a
nice contrast to the darker colors we're
going to use and I'm missing that my
finger you guys know I like to use my
fingers and I'm kind of just keeping it
on the first half or so of my eyelid and
we're going to blend it out next I'm
going to go into the matte red shade
here this one is called damsel maybe or
Missy it's like opposite on the back so
it's hard for me to figure it out and
I'm just deepening up this outer corner
we don't want to bring the red too far
in and keep that on the outer portion
and then last I'm going to go into the
purple shade this is another matte and
I'm just going to be once again
deepening up and keeping this as close
to the lash line as possible and just
kind of in the outer V though in general
we're just deepening up everything we've
already done I'm going to go back in
with the pink shade and just kind of
blend everything out so we don't have
too harsh of lines
I'm trying to keep everything blended
and I'm just going to keep layering
those foreshadows essentially until I'm
happy with the outlook it might take a
second so just layer them until you're
happy with the results once you're happy
with how that looks I'm actually going
to take the orange shade and I'm going
to be kind of focusing it on this inner
portion just to kind of highlight that
we have orange going on too and I'm not
taking it really too far into the brow
bone just just a little not too far I
don't know I'm just being extra I'm
going to go into this shade which is on
the opposite side of the shade we use on
the lid I'm just going to Pat this over
what we put down just to use it for the
inner corner I'm going to go in with the
ladylike shade which is what we used on
the lid it's going to give a really nice
highlight before I go in and do my lower
lash line I'm going to go in with some
liners this one's from colour-pop it's
exit it's the white one I'm putting it
on my waterline and the other liner I'm
using is from laura geller it's the
color brown sugar I'm use it to
tightline and I'm going to run some on
my lower lash line just to kind of act
as a bit of a base for the shadows we'll
go in with for the lower lash line I'm
going to work with those same matte
shades I'm going to start off with the
orange and just kind of blend until I
get a deepness I want I don't know how
dark I want to go in the lower lash line
though I kind of just like the way the
orange looks and then I might go in I'm
going to go in with that purple on the
very very outer corner just to tie in
the purple we used on the top next I'm
going to be using a new mascara from
Lancome this is the amount sooo big and
it's just in black and I'm excited
actually to use it because it looks like
something I'd like has a nice like
fluffy wand and hopefully it'll get some
nice volume and separation and the last
step is list I'm going to be using this
new one from buxom dish is the color San
Francisco I really haven't used it much
I think it means it was just like right
when I got it so we'll see how it looks
hopefully it'll keep that like rosy tone
going on alright and that's the final
look guys I hope you enjoyed this demo I
hope this video was at all helpful for
anyone who was wanting to kind of get
swatches like you guys know this
restocks I believe on Thursday the 20th
at 10 a.m. so if you want to definitely
be on the site waiting for it because it
will probably sell out
again and that's everything thank you so
much for watching guys I'll see you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
