channel so this is last video I'm going
to film today I promise this is going to
be a swatch video on the kat von d mi
vida loca pallid i am someone who loves
holiday palettes I love them I love I
shadow palettes I just love palette
formed products but I'm trying really
really hard this year to only by the few
that I really really want so this one
device for and also the lorac mega Pro
to those are the ones that I have my
eyes on and the ones I'm gonna gonna get
anyway I thought I would just swatch
this palette for you so you guys could
kind of make up your mind see if you
wanted to do it just give you a close-up
it's not necessarily a review because I
haven't used like every shadow it is
what I'm wearing on my eyes today but I
do love it every shadow that i've
swatched i think is amazing i think it's
great quality i don't think it's any
different from the quality and her other
palette so if you like Kat Von D shadows
I feel like you would really love this
palette so the packaging on this it just
like opens and then it's like this loose
thing so that's something different than
the other palettes because i do have
last year's palette so I hope that's
focused in there guys so this is the
palette as a close up there's tons of
fun shades all around and then there's a
lot of neutrals in the middle I will go
over the shade names for you I really
hope that everything's in focus but I
can't really tell because I don't have
glasses on this is vinyl this color is
misfit this is lemme lem my this color
here is hyperballad this color here is
synth this is dark wave this is echo
this shade here is muse this purpley

this matte brown is called noble and
then this one here is called moulder and
that's it as a whole so I'm going to
swatch them for you and I'll tell you
the names as ice watch them but I'm
going to do a close-up of those and tell
you the finish as well so this first
shake here this is legend it's a
beautiful shiny gold shade metallic this
next shade here is Fran this is the
yellow matte color in the palette this
next shade here is analog this is the
matte orange shade in the palette this
shade is harpsichord it is the metallic
warm copper shade in the palette this
next shade is rewind it is the metallic
kind of burgundy color in the palette
super beautiful lenses
such a pretty shade really all of these
are so pigmented this next shade is
called destroyer it's a matte pink color
is the hot pink oh no it's the mat kind
of poorly paint color in the palette
this one is the hot pink color in the
palette this is the colors look super
beautiful again mat which is so nice to
see so many fun colors and that this
next shade is the color love it is a
beautiful metallic lilac color so so
pigmented one of my favorite sheets in
the palette this is what I'm wearing all
over my lids in the video this next
shade is called anthem this is a purple
shade and it is a it's a matte finish I
believe if I'm wrong correct me in the
comments but this is a matte shade
really nice deep purple this next shade
is it muse this is a nice dusty lilac
Matt though it's like a pastel purple
shade very very beautiful very nice
lavender color definitely something more
unique to my collection this next shade
is the color echo it's matt but it has a
bunch of micro Schumer's running through
it it's like a really true blue indigo
type of shade or cobalt blue shade it
has a little bit of purple in it it's
really pretty I'm not sure how those
glitters are going to transfer onto the
lid yet though so this next shade is
dark wave this has kind of like a satin
finish I wouldn't call it metallic but
it's not quite mad really pretty just
blue shade it's a little cool tone and
it does it is a little muddy looking
almost it's very beautiful a good like
crease outer corner shade this next
color is called sent such a stunner this
is a very true electric blue color so
beautiful it is matt
this is a matte blue and that one did
stay in my hand just to kind of show you
guys so did the pink one swell this next
one is called hyperballad I'm going to
race for it this next one here is called
hyper ballot it is a mat deep teal shade
so it's like a Bluegreen it's a deep it
does have a little bit it's not quite as
bright as the last color but very
beautiful and it's also matt this next
shade is a metallic green this is lemme
beautiful shade swatches so wonderfully
this would be a really nice one for fall
with a warm crease very very beautiful
it's metallic obviously this next shade
is called misfit this is kind of like a
satin finish so again not quite matte
but it doesn't have like a ton of
glitters or anything running through it
quite beautiful color it's a little bit
it's brighter than the last shade and
then the brightest green shade in the
palette is vigil this one has like a
slight sheen to it as well super pretty
is this like electric lime green color
really really nice this next shade is
the color skulls it is a metallic white
shade very pretty it's more of like a
cool white shade though it's not like a
cream that next shade is a matte that
shade is called no hole this is the
warmer Matt like transition type shade
in the palette really pretty this is
like one of the ones i have used and i
love using it in the crease this next
shade is called moulder it isn't swatch
well I think it's because I've just been
wiping my hand with
the baby wipe so much but just a nice
matte cream shade perfect for a
highlight on the brow really like the
shade I'm glad it's included it is more
like a creamy yellow color I'm also
quite fair so tart state oh my skin tone
this next shade is a matte Brown called
box really really pretty good to kind of
deepen up any of the looks you might
have going on this next shade is called
Strutter and this is a matte cool tone
or more cool toned brown great for
transition so if you want to do a cool
look you could use this one if you want
to do a warm look you can use the other
Brown called noble the next shade is
called lyric this one is also a shimmery
like whitish pick color but it is more
of a cream then skulls and it's not
quite as metallic as that one this one I
would like better all over the lid
schools I would like more like an inner
corner highlight so that's it there it's
not quite picking up on camera but it
does flash a little pink as well you can
kind of see it there flashes a little
pink the last shade is called black
metal and it is a matte black color
super pigmented I know we have a lot of
these shades but they are great for a
palette that you can just do a complete
look without having to get in anything
else okay guys I hope you enjoyed this
video I know I haven't really done a
video like this so I hope the lighting
was okay i hope it wasn't focus um if
not forgive me i just wanted to give you
a little bit of like a peek at the
palette in case you were wondering about
getting it maybe this could help you
make a better decision so that you can
really get stuff this holiday season
that you're actually going to like and
not just go crazy because of you know
everyone putting stuff out what i will
say about this palette is if you don't
like color you will not like this
palette but if you have a lot of color
eye palettes already i still think this
is a good one because there's so many
matt bright shades in it and I don't
think that those are as common as maybe
like Urban Decay's really fun bright
shimmery shades they don't always do
like a matte yellow like in this palette
so I do think this one is a great
addition to my collection I'm real
excited for it and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I will see you in the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
