in the same outfit as you're gonna see
in the footage coming up but I just
realized as I was going to edit my
footage that I deleted all of the one in
the two parts of this review so I only
have a final reviews to give you I mean
at least it's the most densely
informative information
oh but yeah I do not have the first
impressions using these products I do
not have the tutorial i freakin filmed
using these products so I am so sorry
about that guys I was just on a deleting
rampage last night and I just deleted
the first part of this frickin video and
this video takes so long to film so I'm
really disappointed but I hope you guys
still enjoy the review since I have no
intro to these products and what they
are I am reviewing a bunch of products
from the Kiko free soul collection this
is a summer collection coming out I have
5 different products from the collection
that were sent to me from oxley so I did
get these for free but these are mine a
hundred percent honest opinions I really
wish you guys could have seen me Child's
freaking stuff on so disappointing but
anyway they have to skincare tech
products in the air this is a blurring
and moisturizing face cream I have the
free soul blurring eye balm I have a
really beautiful coral matte lipstick
and then to compact products one is a
cream blush duo really beautiful colors
and then I have a highlighting trio
essentially but yeah so I have been
using these to look where I was learning
all green eyeshadow in a really coral
lip
I was trying these products on so I will
leave any videos where I was using these
products so you guys can see what they
look like on my skin I guess and then
the video where it had kind of like a
pastel peach eye and some like purple on
the lower lash line that was also the
tutorial I freaking filmed now you guys
won't get to see don't you love when all
your hard work goes into the trash bin
and no one gets to see it so that's so
good anyway let's get into swatches and
then I'm gonna probably interview and
some of it might be kind of weird
because I already filmed that part and
so yeah if I say things like you
probably already know just ignore it
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the
review still I believe time stands down
below so you guys can check those out
and that's it let's get onto swatches
and I dropped this too so that's just
another thing add it to the list
all right hi guys we are onto the last
portion of this video it has been a
while since I filmed the other two
portions so I have been using these
products for quite a long time a few
things to get out of the way really fast
this is fake it's raining so there is
some rain noise there's no one taking a
shower I know some of the comments last
time were like uh it's someone taking a
really long showers put your whole video
no it's been raining a lot in LA lately
which has been awesome but that is what
you hear I have tried to muffle the
sound I put a freaking like towel over
where the water drops to try to muffle
it like I look like a crazy person in my
apartment complex but you know you do it
for the YouTube I think that might be it
so let's just get into my final review
of these Kiko free soul collection
products I know you guys have just seen
the footage but to remind you I have
five different products here and overall
I would say that this is a really solid
collection at least for the pieces that
I've tried now there are a lot more
products in this collection if you go to
their website they have a lot of stuff I
feel like Kiko does that with a lot of
their collections like they go fallout
they release a lot it's not just like
one or two products I'm gonna start with
packaging just because it kind of
encompasses all of it I love the
metallic mint I think it's really
beautiful and you can like easily spot
it in your collection I think the
packaging design works really well for
the eye balm because it's just in a
squeezy tube and it's just you know easy
and then I also do like the compacts I
feel like they're different but they
don't take up any more space or anything
but packaging wise on these - they're
not my favorite this is the lipstick I
do like that it has a magnetic closure
on it that's really great again the
color is beautiful but it's just kind of
bulky like it's just a big ol lip
lipstick so that's just not my favorite
for my collection and the fact that I
have a lot of makeup and then when it
comes to the moisturizer I love this
moisturizer packaging wise though I wish
they had gone with more of a squeeze
tube or maybe like a squeeze tube with a
pump or something I think it would have
just made it easier to use this is a
very like summer collection and I feel
like I can throw this in my bag have it
to go and it would be nice for the
moisturizing cream to kind of be like
that also this is insanely bulky you do
get an ounce of product in here but if
you can see that like white thing
is the product and then the rest of this
is just extra packaging so this could
have been way smaller so even if it was
just a smaller jar I would have
preferred that just cuz it's just
massive getting into products I'm gonna
talk about my favorite ones first and
they are the more skincare items in the
collection I think it's really cool that
they did these products with the
collection although I hope that they're
not limited edition because again I
really do like them my favorite one is
the eye balm this is the number one
product I recommend and I really enjoy
this I'm like tempted to go buy one for
my kit and to have a backup because I do
like it that much
I think the applicator on here is pretty
nice you can get like a nice smoothing
cooling effect from it I tend to just
you know squirt some out and then use my
ring finger to tap in and this gives
extra hydration to the under eye area
and I feel like it also Prime's it the
name eye balm I think is a really great
one it really does describe what this is
gonna do for you I don't feel like this
is overly moisturizing so I honestly
feel like it would work for all
different skin types and I also feel
like it would work for all different
skin ages I do not use this as a
substitute for my eye cream I use this
basically like as a primer so even if
it's right after doing my skincare or if
it's not I put this on and then I'll go
in with you know a corrector or just
concealer or whatever I'm gonna do it
gives nice hydration and again Prime's
that area I really enjoy it and what I
really love about this is that I don't
find that I am creasing any more under
my eyes or anything like that so it's
not like that extra hydration is doing
anything negative to affect my other
products it just looks beautiful it
feels nice and I love this so I'm very
happy with this product very glad I got
it and this retails for $20 which i
think is a fair price the next product
here is the blurring and moisturizing
face cream this retails for $28 and I
also think that's a fair price for what
you're getting I don't use this as just
a moisturizer I basically use it again
as a primer or even like a pre primer
step I just need a little bit more
moisture than this gives I think this
will work best if you have combo to oily
skin it gives you hydration but it still
almost has like this matte feeling and
like look about it I
really enjoy this I think that it does
definitely blur like I said I've used
this without primer and then put makeup
on and I've used it under primer and I
like it both ways if you're going for
something more simple I think this works
well as a primer I didn't get any more
oily than I would have if I did or
didn't use a primer so I really enjoyed
this I think it's it's really great I
love the feeling on the skin it
definitely has like a soft hydrated
feeling it doesn't have a powdery
feeling but it definitely isn't like a
sticky moisturizer or anything that's
going to like tug on your fingers it
definitely just feels soft and supple
highly suggest really enjoy now to move
on to the color products in the
collection that I have here I'm gonna
start with the highlighter because it's
my next favorite I did really enjoy this
I'm wearing it today on the cheekbones
and I think it's absolutely beautiful
I'm also wearing the bronze shade on the
lid today and I think quality wise this
is a really nice product
I am so fair that only the lighter shade
out of the trio works for my skin tone
so for me paying $18 for this isn't
quite worth it like I'm so happy I have
it and I really do like genuinely enjoy
this like golden white highlight I find
gold sometimes can pull too gold but
this one it's just really beautiful on
the skin and it almost looks glass like
you don't see it straight on and then
it'll really shine at you but since the
other two are taking up two-thirds of
this like compact and I can't use those
on my face its kind of disappointing for
me I wish that these were all separate
maybe and then I think $18 for a pan of
this would be worth it for me I did use
the center shade on the lid and I think
it looked really pretty it was like this
cool toned mid-tone shade on the lid and
I enjoyed it and then the bronze looks
really beautiful on the lid to have worn
it a couple times that way so I can make
them work I just think for what it is
and the rest of my collection again for
$18 I would not be happy to buy this
exact product for $18 I'm happy to have
it in my collection I would have liked
to get it and maybe like a subscription
box like that's the level it's at in its
current state but like I said if this
was on its own I think that it would be
worth the $18 because I do really like
that highlight my
favorite is the blush zero and this is
different because it is a cream blush
product this retails for $16 which is a
decent price it's pretty expensive I
don't know where Kiko lies like it is an
Italian brand and so I don't know I know
it's like more drugstore but obviously
that price is a little more expensive
but I also feel like the quality is a
little bit better than our drugstore so
I don't know I've used both these colors
multiple times I use them on the eyes as
you guys saw I am wearing this shape
today and I really enjoyed these colors
I love the coral I think they're really
great ones to have in a cream blush this
lighter one is a bit more I would say
sheer but this also has a beautiful like
golden sheen to it I didn't realize it
the first time I had used it has such a
pretty Sheen to it and I really enjoy
that and then this one is quite a bit
more pigmented but they blend out really
nicely they almost go like cream to
powder so they don't have like a sticky
residue on the skin you aren't like left
feeling like it's gross
I have tried putting these on both ways
over foundation before it set with
powder and then I've also put it on on
top of foundation that's been set with
powder that's how I used it today and I
think it works well both ways my
preferred method for this is using a
Beauty Blender and just like the big fat
side of it getting it in there and then
just dabbing on the product
I especially suggest that method if
you're gonna be doing it over powder
just so you don't disturb anything
underneath it but it blended out really
beautifully I think it looks really
great and so I don't use a ton of creams
in my collection but I think these are
really nice quality I love the colors
and they perform really really well so
I'm very happy to have this in my
collection going into spring and summer
I think it'll be fun and the last
product here is the lipstick this is my
least favorite and I do really love the
color I have a little lip gloss on
because I'm wearing it today mix with a
lip gloss I feel like my final look in
these videos is always kind of the way I
guess I would wear it if I had just like
a free choice and so my free choice was
mixing this with a gloss balm type of
situation color wise and pigmentation I
think it's great it's definitely matte I
just find that this wasn't super
comfortable on my lips it was unsafe
driving but again I just
I prefer something that's moisturizing
and comfortable so for me it was a
little bit too drawing I don't know
where this stands though on the line of
like matte lip products and drying lip
products because again I don't test and
use a lot of those so if you like matte
lipsticks you'll probably like this it
didn't have any issues it didn't feather
on me I felt like it did last quite a
while even through like eating and doing
different things but it's still just a
regular bullet lipstick I don't
necessarily look for insane longevity
when it comes to lip products I'd rather
it just look good and if it's easy to
touch-up that's more important to me
than it's staying a long time but then
looking kind of scary and janky and
these are the night so those are all the
products that I've tested from the Kiko
free Sol collection I did want to
mention a couple of things that I
thought were really cool from the line
that I didn't get because like I said
it's a huge range of products coming out
for summer one of them is a liquid
bronzer it looks really interesting
because it has a doe foot applicator and
I just I don't know the color looked
pretty I'm really into cream bronzers
and I think it goes well with the cream
blushes that are in the collection so
that kind of had me interested they also
have a concealer in this collection I
believe they're like six different
shades but since I loved the eye balm so
much I was interested in potentially
trying out the concealer and then
something that I just thought was fun
and I feel like we don't see very often
they do have some colored mascaras with
this line one is a darker burgundy so
that one's going to be a little bit more
subtle and then one is a really fun
lilac that one is the one that I
probably want to try I mean both of
those look really fun but um I think
it's really cool to add a pop of
something different I'm not a lot of
people do colored mascaras and a lilac
one seems like a really fun and
interesting color
alright so that's gonna wrap it up for
this testing testing one two three
review I'm so glad that you guys enjoyed
the wet and wild one so much and I
definitely enjoy doing reviews like this
like I feel confident in my reviews
because I know I've tried these products
I know how I feel about them and it's
nice to be able to give you the first
impressions a tutorial and solid
information and I'm really glad that you
guys are enjoying it so thank you if
there's any products that you really
want to see me review in this style
definitely leave them down below and
depending I can try to work those in I
I'm gonna try for the most part to make
these about collections and products
that I'm just genuinely interested in
whether it's PR or whether I bought it
myself just things that I actually want
to wear so that I can give you guys
information on it but um let me know I
would love to know what you guys are
interested in and what you're interested
in seeing me try and I'm gonna end the
review there thank you so much for
watching guys I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
