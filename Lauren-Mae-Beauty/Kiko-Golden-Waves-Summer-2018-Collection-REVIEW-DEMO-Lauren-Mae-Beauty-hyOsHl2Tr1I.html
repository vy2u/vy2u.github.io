Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a demo in review
for you guys on the Kiko golden waves
collection this is their summer 2018
collection they did send me this stuff
and I asked you guys in a previous video
if you wanted to see it and a lot of
people said they did so I've been
testing this stuff out and I thought I
would share my thoughts as I applied
this makeup I have my base makeup on I
have my eyebrows done but other than
that the rest we're gonna be applying so
that's it all of the packaging and
everything for this collection is golden
which i think fits the named super well
since it's the golden waves collection
Kiko seems to do really big collections
I'm not sure if all of these things are
100% new items or if some of them are
Reap remoted but it's beautiful
nonetheless everything came in a similar
box to this I really loved that and this
is what all of the compacts look like
you're gonna see the reflection of the
camera and I have touched it quite a bit
so it's a little bit dirty but they're
all super super beautiful a lot of
attention to detail they do feel a
little bit like lightweight like they're
plastic but I think overall they're
really nice so I'm gonna start off with
bronzer today oh yeah I curled my hair
today we're like extra I don't know I
just wanted to try it so I did I tried
it but we're gonna go on with the
bronzer and this is the shade zero to
Mediterranea tan there are three
different shades in the collection
number one would be a better fit
probably for me and the number three
would think would be even darker than
this but it's actually I feel like
really similar to number one in tone and
then it's not swirled like this product
is this product has like a mix of the
like kind of like that baked element
where it has different colors the number
three bronzer in the collection does not
have that it is just like a plain
bronzer I think it might have a tiny bit
of a sheen to it but that's honestly the
one that I would want the most out of
the collection this retails for $28 u.s.
and it's kind of expensive but let me
show you how I like to apply it since
this is a little bit dark I like to just
tap my brush it very gently and like
evenly coat my brush and then I'll
usually like tap it off on the mirror
inside and then I go in with the brush
that way just so I can build up the
color although this is dark for me I can
make it work for my skin tone and I
really do like the way it looks on the
skin I think this would work really well
for like medium skin tones I don't feel
like they have anything honestly that's
going to work for dark tones so I wish
they had that since this is the darkest
one it's not that dark so I like to just
put my bronzer in the kind of like III
type of thing so I will put it into kind
of the hollows and up on the cheekbone a
little and this is just gonna bring some
dimension back to the face I'm using a
brush from Coastal Scents right now I
really like this kind of tapered brush
for applying bronzer and then you can
already see just the difference it makes
to the face not only is it warming my
face up and giving me life it is giving
me a little bit more definition as well
alright so that is my bronzer applied I
wouldn't really light with it
I do like really bronzing up my forehead
you guys know that but I didn't do too
much
I think this suits me really well this
is a nice golden color but it does have
this tiny bit of red to it this has a
nice natural skin like finish it's not
overly matte but it definitely doesn't
have any shimmer to it
it just looks like skin let's move on to
blush we have the same type of packaging
we had earlier this is the blush shade
number three in damask rose this is the
coolest out of all of them the other two
there's like a nude one that's number
one and then there's like a coral one so
both of those I think go with the
collection really well this one I think
is really nice it's definitely different
for what I have in my collection again
we have that baked situation going on I
like to gently tap my brush into the
product this is pigmented but not overly
pigmented so you can build it up how you
want but that's just my preferred method
of application when it comes to any
color face products I really like having
control to build up how I want to so I'm
using an angled blush brush this is like
the blush brush I use and I'm just
putting that on to the apples of the
cheeks again you can see the difference
here I like this color
quite a bit if you're into those mom
like rose toned a little bit more cool
toned colors I think you'd really like
this again it blends out really nicely
and I don't have any issues with it
staying throughout the day either
that's the blush it's a little bit heavy
and something that I've really been
enjoying doing before I go in with the
highlighter which is the next thing and
I'll zoom us in I like to go over my
face now with a pen like a finishing
powder so I've already set my face with
a powder after I applied my foundation
but now that I have everything on I'm
gonna go in with this becca powder this
is the pink haze powder but you could
use anything that kind of has more of a
glowy finish and what I like to do is
I'll take my powder brush and I just
loaded up with product and I just kind
of buff all those areas so you don't
have any like lines
I've really enjoyed this method of
making sure my bronzers not too crazy on
my forehead or that my blush isn't like
you know really insane
it's just kind of melds everything
together and because it has that a
little bit of like radiance to it I find
that it just looks really nice on the
skin so yeah that's just a step I've
been doing lately and I've really been
enjoying it so before we go in with
highlighter I want to spray my face I've
been using the Too Faced you guys know I
love this one you could use fix+ I
wouldn't use a mattifying spray because
I like the kind of glowy effect that
this whole collection has it's summer
it's golden I want to keep it you know
really do we all right so I just sprayed
my face I'm just gonna let that dry them
and a zoom us in so you guys can see the
highlighter and all of its glory I
didn't tell you but the blush retails
for $22 so it's a bit expensive the
highlighter retails for the same amount
of money it's in the exact same
packaging I have the shade zero one and
this is a more gold toned they also have
like a golden rose tone number two there
are only two in the whole collection so
I'm going to zoom us in so we can do the
highlighter up close okay we are up
close and personal so for the highlight
I'm going to be taking this brush from
shop masae it's the AOA f19 brush it's
very similar
I feel like to the anastacio one so why
set my face already or kind of like got
rid of that powdery finish is I really
want this to be able to have something
to adhere to I find with this formula
it's a little bit dry because it's that
baked formula I just want something to
kind of like bring out the sheen a
little bit better so I'm going to be
using the brush and just going on to the
cheekbone and it gives just a really
nice radiance to the skin I don't feel
like it's too much you can build it up
for sure if you want to but I don't want
it to look too fake
another thing I've been doing as well is
just like slightly dampening the brush
and then going in and just adding a
little bit more of that highlighter to
the very tops of the cheekbone and
you're gonna get a lot more shine from
it so I think this will work well
depending on what you want you can do
something subtle you can really bling it
up this has a gold reflex to it but I
find that when you're just looking
straight on it's not like really
blinding and then when you hit the light
that's when you can really see it so
that's the highlighter I really do like
this I think it's really nice
alright so we're already zoomed in let's
move on to the eyes I already have them
primed I already have them set with this
collection they came out with four
different liquid eyeshadows I have two
of them here oh look at that it's so
pretty guys this one is a copper shade
it's number two and then the shape we're
gonna be using - Jenay i mean these are
like liquid the shape we're using today
is zero one and it oh my gosh I just I
just poured it oh wow oh my god the one
we're gonna be using today is the golden
one so these are different liquid
formula than anything I've used
previously you guys know that I'm really
into liquid I shadow I've really been
enjoying that trend but these are legit
liquids these remind me of the Josie
Maran
coconut eyeshadow water eyes shadow
coconut water eyes shadow zs-- that is
the type of consistency these are
they're that liquidy these have just a
beautiful shine to them I find that
they're pretty sheer they do take a
second to dry down but they are
beautiful anyway we're gonna be using
the golden one today and then with these
I've really been enjoying using my
violet Voss eyes shadow I just I like
the simplicity of these since they
aren't insanely pigmented like they show
up on the eye they just have this
beautiful sheen to them they're very
like effortless I've really been
enjoying them but you're not gonna get a
ton of pigmentation even though these
swatches might look like it I find once
you're like actually applying them to
the eye it's hard to build up that
opacity so we're gonna go in with the
shade transition from the Holy Grail
palette
I'm just going to be buffing that into
the crease of the eye once you have that
worked in I'm gonna now go in with the
shade are you kidding me and this is
just slightly deeper and we're just
going to be working that mostly in the
outer part of the eye I really like this
being a very effortless look and we're
really focusing on just being golden and
glowy and like beautiful and so I don't
want the eye look to be too harsh so I'm
keeping it to the outer corner and I'm
not going too deep with it and just kind
of smokey blended goodness while I'm
here I'm also just gonna take transition
and run it on my lower lash line really
smoked out you could also use a bronzer
to do this step and once you have your
base down now we're gonna go in with the
liquid eye shadow I like to apply the
first layer straight on with the DOE
foot and then I'm going to be tapping
that out with my finger I'm okay with it
shearing out as I blend it out I'd
rather it have just more of like an
effortless glow to it then trying to
keep that opacity
all right so that's one coat blended out
I'm gonna let that dry so then we can go
over with a second coat for the second
coat I like to go in just from the DOE
foot straight on my finger and blend it
on that way so that's basically two
layers dried I will say with these I
wouldn't worry about trying to get them
super opaque it's just not their nature
so if that's what you're looking for
these won't work for you but I do like
the way they look just like kind of
sheared out like that no it's just to
make sure we have that darker outer
corner I'm going to go in with the shade
are you kidding me again and just make
sure we have a nice blend here another
thing I've been doing with this shade
specifically is going in with the
highlighter just taking my finger and
tapping on the lid portion just to
really emphasize that gold only do this
if you want more of a pop it's gonna you
know brighten up that shade I don't
think you need this though if you want
that more sheer color and I'm just going
to tap it into my inner corner as well
to finish with the lash line I'm gonna
go in with are you kidding me in a
smaller more detailed brush and really
buff that on the outer portion closest
to the lash line just to add a little
bit more definition for liner I really
been liking Mac's coaster ratio with
this look because it's a bit warmer so
I'm gonna be tight lining as well as
adding a little bit on the lower lash
line so we have a little bit more
definition and some smokey warmth going
on and the last product from the
collection that I'm going to be using
today this is the mascara it's just the
golden waves mascara this is what the
wand looks like it looks kind of just
whatever but I've actually really been
enjoying it I find that it gives me a
nice separation not too much length it
kind of just makes my natural lashes
look better than they should or do I
will say though that I am someone who
definitely from for the most part I have
pretty nice lashes most mascaras work
for me so this one's been really nice I
definitely have been enjoying it so I'm
gonna do one eye and show you guys the
difference
alright so there's one coat kind of
nestle applied I need to like clean up a
few places but I find it really opens my
eyes my lashes just look nice I enjoy it
a lot so I'm gonna do the other eye and
I'll be better okay so those are the
eyes done I really like the way they
look again that mascara is really nice
I'm gonna use it all until it's gone
after you know this review and
everything it doesn't transfer on me it
isn't flake on me
so it's just a really nice solid mascara
i decided i do want like i'll just a
brighter inner corner so I'm just going
to beef that up a little bit with that
highlighter for lips today I'm gonna be
going in with my own products they do
have some lipsticks but they're kind of
darker and they're mad and I just think
the gloss goes better they do have a
gloss as well it has like gold flecks in
it but anyway I'm gonna be using this
this is a bare minerals gloss in the
shade I believe it's Cosmo I'm just
gonna gently put it on I think coral
just you know goes so well with the
golden colors as well as with my eye
color and I don't want too much of this
on my lips
I hate when my lips feel like goopy so I
go in with my finger and work the gloss
in as well as get rid of any like excess
and then just to go over that just a
little bit I'm gonna be adding the shade
tight fit from colour-pop it's also a
gloss just in the center for some
highlight the last thing I need to do is
I'm just going to spray my face once
again and then I'm gonna zoom it out
give you guys kind of like my overall
thoughts on the collection and yeah I'll
show you the final look as well my hair
has almost completely had all the curl
fall out even though I curled it so
tight okay so let's talk about the
collection overall I feel like this
collection is pretty dang solid like I
think every product that I have and that
I've tested from it has worked really
well I've enjoyed it I think it has a
place in my collection if I had to tell
you guys some of my favorites I really
do love the mascara I really do like the
liquid eyeshadows just because there's
something different there's something
super effortless about them I like that
they're sheer they just give such a
beautiful glow to the eyelid in my last
set of videos I was wearing the copper
one if you are wondering and I just feel
really pretty when I'm wearing them I
also love the blush and
later though I think those are really
nice and then the bronzer even though
it's dark it still works for me I still
want to keep it in my collection so
overall I'm just I'm really happy and
satisfied I feel like some of the
product prices are a little bit
expensive for me not that they're not
worth it but I'm just cheap so I wish
like the bronzer wasn't almost $30
I wish the blush was it 22 the
highlighter was in 22 the mascara is 16
which I feel like is okay the liquid
eyeshadows are 12 each which i think is
a pretty decent price at least I don't
know Kiko enough when it comes to seals
if like you can get things more
regularly on sale so yeah that's kind of
everything I have to say if you wanted
something from this collection something
was intriguing you I don't think you'll
be disappointed but I also don't feel
like anything from this collection is
something you have to have in your
collection like there's nothing here
that I'm like please buy this you need
this you know what I mean so I hope you
guys enjoyed the review and the demo at
the end here I did want to sneak in a
little giveaway I honestly don't do a
lot of giveaways on my channel it's not
because they don't love you guys or want
to show you guys my appreciation I have
a whole video about giveaways if you
want to check it out I've only done one
in the past and it was kind of weird so
anyway I am gonna be doing a giveaway
since they sent me so much stuff it's
like I just didn't want to like use it
all just to test it one time if it was
something I wasn't naturally gravitating
to I didn't want to just like use it and
waste it and not be able to give it away
so for the rules of this you just have
to be subscribed to my channel and just
leave a comment down below it doesn't
matter what it is it can be like
something about the giveaway it cannot
be I'm not like tagging this at all
about the giveaway it's only for people
who stay till the end and like actually
watch the video and then the only thing
is that this will be for us only it's
not that I don't want to send it
international if we're being honest it
just costs more money I don't have the
money right now to send stuff overseas
but trust me I want to get there in the
future so it's not like all my giveaways
will only be us only it's just this one
plus I kind of thought since Kiko isn't
as well-known here in the u.s. it might
be something fun for someone to get here
instead of someone overseas that all
being said let me just show you what I
will be sending one of you the first
item that I have here is the makeup bag
that goes with it this is super cute and
gold
it's pretty large actually I feel like
it could fit quite a bit of stuff in
here so I will be giving that away I
will also be giving away the three-piece
brush set so I'll have a picture up here
I don't want to like open stuff I want
to keep it nice and pristine so whoever
wins it can like enjoy you know fresh
new stuff so this is a three piece brush
set two of the roll-on eyeliners that
are part of the collection will also be
in the giveaway one is a gold and one is
a blue color and last I have three of
the eight lipsticks that come in the
collection these are all matte and I
thought I would pass those along too so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this little
giveaway at the end I'm not like saying
it's extravagant or anything I just
would love to pass this on and if you
were already interested in the
collection since I wasn't gonna use
these I thought I'd kind of be a perfect
way to tie it in I'm going to be picking
a winner like three days after this
video goes up which I think it's gonna
go up today on Monday I will contact the
winner via like youtube messages so make
sure you check that I will also come
back to this video and leave them in the
description they will have 24 hours to
get back to me and then I guess I'll
just pick a new person I don't know I'm
gonna use a random comment like
generator to pick the winner so other
than that I hope you guys enjoyed the
video let me know what you guys think
about the collection is there anything
you were wanting or anything that you
weren't really wanting and other than
