I am going to be doing a review for you
on all of the clean color lipsticks that
I got in my all cosmetics wholesale hall
I got 12 of them one second falling and
opening oh no I got a lot of them so i
will have lip swatches up in the video
but just to go into the review these are
not my favorite products i bought them
for 1499 for the 12 pack on the website
and if i had to repurchase that or what
I repurchase out I would not I would
rather save my money saved my fifteen
dollars and instead by one lime crema
lipstick in a certain color that I was
wanting a few points on these the
packaging looks like this it's a kind of
a weird shaped bullet and it does have
the color of the lipstick outside on the
packaging that's like one good thing
about it that it shows you what the
color is the formula on each and every
one of these is different so sometimes
you get one and it goes on great and
it's like more waxy and like feels like
a regular lipstick other ones it go on
super like greasy creamy so not only are
they creamy with their Gracie um and so
that makes the product move around and
so I just can't get an even layer of the
product on your lips I feel like they go
on Patchi especially colors like this or
the lighter pink they go on and they
show all the fine lines because of their
light color so that doesn't look good I
just I don't think that they do a great
job and if you're gonna wear colored
lipstick you want it to look great
personally I would not repurchase these
the smell of them let's mention that
they smell like perfume like an old
lady's perfumes on your face and that
can be quite distracting and disgusting
especially after a long time of where i
would not stamp like stamp the approval
for these ones i think you know i only
paid a dollar and change form so that's
nice but they're just they're still
grows like you know when you add them
all together i have 12 of them so have
12 gross lipsticks that i don't like
that i spent fifteen dollars on I'd
rather have the fifteen dollars and
actually
colors that I do like I will say the
colors that are like this or you know
like a normal lipstick color maybe just
like a light pink or dark pink or an
orange or purple those ones do apply
better but why would you buy there's
still sub part of things in the
drugstore so why would you buy these
ones when you could buy something better
quality and in the same color so overall
um is not a good review so I feel bad
but they're just not great products I'm
not saying I wouldn't use these now that
I have them if I was doing a halloween
look or something that you know i wanted
a colored lipstick for i would try to
make these work i didn't use a base or
anything for the lip swatches you're
about to see um but I definitely would
not you know go out and buy them I would
rather again just save up that money and
just get one really nice thing instead
of 12 crappy things I know that's like a
quick review I just don't wanna spend
too much time on it cuz it's not
something I love so here will be nasty
lip swatches I do people do that like
lip swatches of stuff they don't even
like I don't know but um the lip
swatches will be after this and I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I hope
you saved you guys some money thanks
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
