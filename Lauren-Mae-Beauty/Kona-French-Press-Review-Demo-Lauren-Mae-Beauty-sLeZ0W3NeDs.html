Lauren I was actually sent to this
coffee press from idyllic homes they
sell on amazon for review so i was sent
this item for free i want to be
completely transparent about that in no
way is this sponsored or am i getting
any money from it it simply was free
product for a reviews so i thought i
would review this for you guys if your
coffee drinkers you probably know what a
coffee press is but this is just an
alternative way to a coffee pot or say a
Keurig that you can make in brew coffee
you take the lid off and then you would
put your scoops of coffee in you'd put
your water in and then as you push the
plunger down you are taking all the
coffee grounds and pushing them to the
bottom and your coffees good to go so I
actually have really been enjoying this
product for a few statistics on it the
container here is actually glass and
it's surrounded in a plastic like holder
I really like that because it just feels
less fragile than if it was just all
glass and you were just setting glass
down on your countertop I also like that
it's glass because you are using hot
liquid whether you boil your water or
you're putting it in the microwave
whichever one suits you I just like that
you aren't going to be like leeching
like fights and things like that from a
plastic container since it is glass so I
really enjoy that about it it is also
dishwasher safe the container as well as
the lid and I don't dishwasher it
between every single use I would do it
like once a week but this is also
unscrew able screw unscrew ball I don't
know this easily can be unscrewed so
that you can separate all three of these
parts and get a really nice cleaning out
of it which i really like since you are
dealing with coffee grounds I have also
used this with tease to like loose leaf
tea or any tea that has like bigger
particles in it works really well in
this too so you can use it in multiple
ways i am going to include some footage
of me and say I'm just making some
drinks because we like to have fun and
make drinks and I just thought it'd be
something more to this video there's not
much else to really say about this it
works really well as you push the
plunger down I think that it works
really well it's not like it's you know
wobbly or anything it pushes down really
nicely
and I feel like it does catch all of the
coffee grounds you're not having like a
chunky coffee drink because the mesh in
here is quite fine one last thing I
wanted to mention about this product
that i really enjoyed I do have a Keurig
and i will say i'm not a huge coffee
drinker mostly because i just like cold
drinks so most the time coffee is hot
and one of the things that i really
liked about this was the fact that you
can brew more than one cup and since I
like to kind of refrigerate my products
for a little bit before I make a drink
it's nice to be able to do maybe two
cups if I know I'm going to want quite a
bit of coffee at once and I can kind of
make sure that I don't boil my water all
the way or I don't put as hot of water
in so I just like that I can control it
better than the Keurig in that sense
specifically for my needs of wanting
iced coffee and like iced teas all the
time but another thing that I really
liked about this product as opposed to
the Keurig is just I feel like it's way
less wasteful I know with k-cups you're
just buying all these little k-cups to
fill in there and it is really easy and
you don't have a ton of cleanup or
anything but I just feel like
environmentally speaking they're not
necessarily as green there's a lot of
waste that comes with that and so that's
just something to keep in mind and
something that I really just feel more
sound about using this really the clean
up with this isn't that big of a deal it
doesn't take much time at all and a few
compost you can easily use your coffee
grounds or any of your loose leaf tea
and you can put that in your compost and
it's like an easy way to do that I know
that you can use the cake up like
refillable inserts that's also what you
can do it I was just mentioning this
because I think that's really nice and I
also like how small this is easily you
can put this up in your cabinet you
don't have to have a huge Keurig on your
counter or anything like that and that
is just something a positive I thought I
would know and something that since I do
own a Keurig that I noticed having this
product and using this product that's
everything for this review I hope that
you guys enjoyed it I know it's kind of
a little bit different but as I get sent
things cuz my channel is growing a
little bit I just want you guys to know
I would give you guys a hundred percent
honest reviews all the time I am used to
getting products whether it's
as I worked in beauty stores and stuff
so just because it's sent for free to me
doesn't mean that it automatically means
it's a good product and in no way am i
forcing you guys to buy it i just
thought i would show you a review let
you know about it and then you guys as
consumers can make the educated decision
to do whatever you want to with your own
money i hope you guys enjoyed the
footage of me and Sam also making the
drinks definitely a different video for
me and filming style so hopefully you
enjoyed that I don't know if it's at the
beginning or at the end I don't know how
I'm gonna edit this because it's a
little bit different for me I will have
a link for it in the description box if
you want to go buy it and so you can
easily find it and that's everything I
hope you guys enjoy and I will see you
in my next video bye guys okay hi guys
this is going to be some of the
ingredients you're going to want
potentially if you're going to make some
iced coffee biggest thing is the ground
coffee obviously and then you can kind
of switch out what you want I have some
fun things they're whipped cream coffee
creamer some syrups and then you're
going to get into making the coffee so I
just put about 4 cups of the or four
scoops of the ground coffee into the
maker and then when I was ready i added
the water I let this steep for about 4
minutes before plunging and then once I
had let it steep I just plunged slowly
so that I could get all the grounds out
to the bottom then I actually decanted
this into a separate container so I
could put it in the fridge and let it
cool down so that my coffee could be
cold then I took a shaker added some ice
I also added some of the coffee i only
used about half of the coffee that I'd
man i added some of the syrup this was a
hazelnut flavor a little splash of milk
and then i also added some of the coffee
creamer just to again have a taste good
i shook all of this up i poured it into
a glass and then i also added some fun
touches just some whipped cream and then
chocolate chips because i love chocolate
of course and yeah i enjoyed it but a la
strada it had it off our clip of me
drinking it um the next drink we're
gonna do is a t1 i used the tea on the
left it's a mango black tea and i just
decided to use all of it for this one i
added some of the water and then i
decided to make more of this so i added
even more water into the coffee press
once that was done I just again sifted
all of the pieces to the bottom with the
plunger and then I again put this in a
separate container so I could put it in
the fridge so it could chill out for a
little bit then I had it submit nice to
my tea drinks and I use these spoon to
kind of crash up the mint so that I
could get the flavor into UT itself I
really liked the way the mango tasted
with the mint and I poured it obviously
into the cups and then added some of the
sugar this is your sugar in the raw and
then me and Sam enjoy them I hope you
guys enjoyed this video definitely
something different but i'll see you in
the next one second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
