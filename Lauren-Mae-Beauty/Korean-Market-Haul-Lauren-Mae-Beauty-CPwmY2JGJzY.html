I want to say thank you so much to all
the new subscribers welcome to the
channel I just wanted to say like hi hi
it feels like forever since I talked to
you guys because I haven't filmed in
like a week and I was filming before I
got my job all like twice a week three
times a week and now I can really only
film like once maybe twice so we're just
going to roll with it and see what I can
do this schedule is going to kick my
butt that's all I have to say it's kind
of cry cry anyway this is a Korean
market hall this last weekend me and Sam
had saturday off together so i think it
was like our last saturday off probably
in forever so we win and we just hung
out and did some things we went to a
korean market and i wanted to haul some
things that I got so actually everything
we bought so I bought a couple beauty
items and the rest is like food so we'll
do the beauty items first and then if
you don't wanna watch it you don't have
to you and then the food items i will
show after that and then i'm going to do
like um i'm gonna film me like trying
them with me sam who's my husband in
case you didn't know Sam's my husband
and then my friend looping from school
who also has a channel here on YouTube
and we are going to ya eat them on
camera and try them out I'm a super
picky eater so we'll see how that goes
anyway let's get into the hall I got
kind of a lot of stuff so first off I
got three masks this one here is a
cooling cucumber sheet mask in 15
minutes you're supposed to put that on
this is a juicy pomegranate mask and
again this one's 15 minutes the other
one I got was white rose so these are
just sheet masks I've only used one
sheet mask ever so I thought these would
be good and I think these were only like
they're a dollar piece or maybe 199 or
something so I wanted to try those out
and these are the last beauty items I'm
telling you I didn't get a ton of beauty
stuff so these are makeup remover wipes
we actually use these at school so when
we were like looking down the aisle I
was like oh my gosh we use these at
school Sam and they were only 199 for 25
no 4 30 of them I thought that was a
great deal I've already used these on my
skin at school so I know that they're
not gonna like break me out or anything
and
yeah I just think that's a great price
I've been staying away from wipes
recently because I'm trying not to be
lazy even though not that I like clean
my face I don't feel like I have an
amazing skincare routine although I feel
like I will start to have one now that
I'm the skincare like manager I my
stethoscope or so um you know I probably
should and I'm gonna start like getting
more into skincare so you'll probably
see that reflected on my channel but I
thought this would be great for nights
when I'm lazy I will be working really
really hard I'm in the next couple of
months like basically the next year I'll
be working really hard I know that
sounds insane to say a whole year but
that's really what it is I'm going to
school from for makeup I'm also working
at a beauty store and then I'm trying to
still take youtube too it's crazy and
I'm working full-time like 40 hours a
week back to the wipes um I got green
tea like flavor or scent and i also got
cucumber they also have an aloe one and
i think like it Rose one or something
but I just got these ones cuz I thought
they'd be nice and I didn't want to get
like a million like if I really like
them and I want more i'll just go back
and get them but they were a dollar
ninety-nine apiece the brand on this to
just so everyone knows is skin light
everyday natural skin yeah anyway those
that's all the beauty stuff so the rest
is going to be a lot of food candy
random stuff um I just picked out things
that were one cheap I wasn't trying to
like spend a ton of money I'd rather
like try more items and spend the same
amount of money than try less and they
were more expensive or something so
let's just get into these half of these
I don't even know what they are they
might just all be in Korean Japanese I
don't know what they're in so I'm sorry
it's not meant to be offensive its i
just don't know i got these hello panda
little double chocolate chocolate
biscuits with choco cream um yeah it
looks like there's like chocolate goop
in the middle of these so we'll try
those out and see how those are oh yeah
i got these here these are like peach
gummy can
i really love peach peaches one like my
favorite since it's on my favorite like
flavors so I thought this would be
really good it says I'm here the peach
is the fruit with the longest history in
the Orient Japan grows its own original
kind white peach and yeah so hopefully
these will be good I don't think it'll
be like a rough one Sam's getting home
right now hold on okay I'm back guys but
if you hear any noises it's because stay
in this home and I usually don't feel
money some home so he's gonna be a
creeper listening to me in the other
room anyway the next thing I got are
these these do not have any English
words on them so i want to say they
might be like sweet and savory they look
like they're like caramelized something
on them I got these just for myself like
not even just to try I like rice cake so
I thought I would try these these are
baked frosted rice cake snacks sweet
with a hint of sea salt so I thought
those would be maybe good I don't want
to try them out oh yeah i also got ramen
just to try it not like a big deal i got
soda candy I don't know what this is or
what kind of soda it looks like it's
gonna be blue so we'll see how that goes
Oh with apple flavored there's apples on
the back um so we'll try that out oh
yeah we got these little sours I don't
know how much these worthy or like
randomly found some more I think these
are going to be Apple too and they're
gummies and it looks like it's like a
thumbs up on the packaging like there's
little thumbs up there so that must mean
it's good right hopefully there we go
all fit a min Sam picked out these these
are like little moon pie looking things
they look like they're chocolate-covered
something with like chocolate in the
middle so we'll try those out again
these have nothing on them instead of oh
it's a rice pie that's what it is it's a
rice pie I got these choco puffs and
these are melon chocolate crunch
crackers I don't know what this is I
think this is like a chocolate grain
candy or something it's like a little I
think a chocolate bar or something I got
another chocolate puffs but these are
banana flavored I don't really like
no but i thought i would try them just
to see what they tasted like so okay the
rest of the stuff that i got our drinks
so I got two different like fruit jelly
little sucky drinks um that sounded
weird anyway little fruit drinks you
like suck out the pouch is still sounded
weird this is fruits jelly drink and
this is peach flavored so I thought that
one would be good and then I also got
the leche or lychee I don't know I think
you say it lychee and let jay is like
milk and Spanish huh maybe um but yeah I
got this once I think it's lychee I
think correct me if I'm wrong but you
know whatever I hope they're good but
I'm kind of weird about that type of
stuff I got this peach 2% drink I don't
know I think it looks like water so I
thinking I'm thinking it's just like
flavored water maybe like a vitamin
water but peach flavored i doesn't seem
to be carbonated I don't know though so
this two percent drink I also got this
aloe drink I thought that would be
interesting there's also like pulp in
here like a low pulp floating around you
can kind of see it twirling um so that
should be interesting we'll see how that
one goes and then this last one here I
this one's a carbonated drink this is in
a coconut flavored and I thought the
bottle is kind of cool in its glass so
that was kind of interesting there's
also like a ton of directions on how to
like open this up so that seems like it
will be a process so oh there's one more
thing let me go get it out of the fridge
okay so the last thing i got this is a
red bean cake in with black sesame so
this has to be refrigerated it was
refrigerated in the store was 99 cents
so I got that to try it's kind of like
gushy discussions that is everything
that's all the stuff I got it's kind of
a lot of stuff so hopefully I like some
of it so it wasn't just bought for
entertainment only and I hope that I can
also serve nutrition or enjoyment
purposes of eating but let me know if
you've tried any of the stuff down below
in the comments if something's your
favorite or if you don't like something
or maybe even recommend like your
favorite type of
Andy or sweet or treat that is that I
could probably find at the cream market
anyway that is everything for this video
guys I will hopefully get that other
video up in some time as soon I just
don't know when I'm going to be able to
sit down in the film like all three of
us so anyway I will see you in my next
video and I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
