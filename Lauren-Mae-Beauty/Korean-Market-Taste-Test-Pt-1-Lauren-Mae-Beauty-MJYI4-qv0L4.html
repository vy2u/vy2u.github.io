we're going to do like a thumbs-up
thumbs-down type of thing if we like it

if you see gray in our hair or if we
look a little weird it's because we did
a theater makeup today at school i'll
post a are all insert a clip of us

sugar skull and she was a creepy clown
from the new Poulter a smoothie so

smallest let's go yeah let's go easy
we're gonna start something easy the
first one are these baked frosted rice
snacks so they're sweet with a hint of
sea salt they shouldn't be too bad yeah
a little individual snacks I've they're
really thin I hope they're ready thicker
just feeling like styrofoam yeah you ate
it already okay I'm gonna blend it is
sweet with a hint of salt salty I'm
gonna do a rating system you guys knew
that those do you're gonna read it no
for bland snacks I'm gonna give this a 4
out of 5 um I don't like this type of
snack I'm gonna give it like a 7-eleven
Oh out of 10 I give it a 5 and this is
my first rice cake with all my food is
this a risky yeah yeah this is my first
one I mean I thought it was gonna be
saltier cuz of the sea salt it's not
it's kind of sweet good by the time yeah
oh ok it's pretty good these are okay
especially like maybe they're like a
diet food I don't know I like this type
of stuff it's like crunchy it's not like
gooey so that's a plus oh yeah nice you
got two for the price of one you pick
the next one or Lupe what do you want to
do what
we're gonna go with another easy we're
all those maybe don't know what these
are I don't even know which way the
package is held I think this way we
don't know what these are they're all in
I'm I think Kareem what is that is
anything probably there in another
language so we don't know what they are
I'll show you what they're like little
squiggly thing they smell like I don't
know race what are they smell like oh
you can eat ones go here I'm sorry baby
week we're arming little know this yeah
like ramen that going melodrama our
squid yeah they do that no why'd you say
something is your problem I'm ready
honey I'm sorry what's good it's like
sweet ramen it's like popcorn and it's
like ramen popcorn oh yeah it's bland my
tongue is also very fun is yeah more on
the sweet it's sweet but still really
bland yeah I give it a six yeah I
wouldn't pick these out i'll give it a
yeah five out of time yeah i'd give it
probably a five-hour sex yeah apples are
fun I may not eat them yeah like if you
were watching the movie yeah I don't
know okay those are not bad we have to
ok so far no panda okay these are the
hello pandas these are so cute it's a
little pan on them piano panda they come
wrapped in another container which is I
think so they have a few like chocolate
doing but they're like oh no they're
like a gusher but like a cookie guy
um what are those bears huh Oh Teddy
Graham no they're not ya know beautiful
been really hard open they are it is
just straight lord give me strength all
right I have to kiss to the 1000 it's
like a hand it's like a panda head hurts
me we're gonna I'm gonna happen either
kicking a soccer ball mi- it holding a
lollipop that's good now it's like a
chocolate cookie oh it's not goopy is it
hazelnut or something maybe that's likes
it's sweet it's like chocolate yeah and
i thought i'm doing more gooey like an
outing or something there's some kind of
another one this is there some it's
right i give it an eight this isn't baby
cause a hockey stick pan there with a
black eye um yeah that one was actually
really good i'd give it a like a seven
and a half a day yeah yeah number seven
simon cowell chill thank you for me okay
um I want to go with the soda candy oh
no I'm not ready I'm not ready we're
going with the soda candy next I think
this is apple flavor because there's
apples on the back um because it says
the word Apple and does a apple in
English this isn't showing and it's a
hard candy yeah it's an apple it's I'm
almost one hundred percent of that Oh
what if they're like Susan Leland I am
that I'm wondering oh wow okay he didn't
always bhella sport it tastes like
medicine oh no no as much I kind of dude
I don't think it's fizzing just a piece
of candy yeah zoom and so kind of let me
down cuz I thought was gonna be like I
know like soda II you're like something
like apples
I've never had alcoholic when you bite
into it like I mean it's the same candy
tastes kind of like powdery like oh
really this one kind of no not like it
has powder in there but like that taste
oh no are you talking about it's like if
a granny had some people like a DS
really have a hard candy Senate I'm
trying to be classy putting it back of
my wrapper but it's okay I would give
that like five just because I'm not in a
hard candies I give it a 3 video yeah
but it wasn't like bad it's just like
man don't get them this one is probably
one that I'm really scared for but not
the most this is the choco puff melon
chocolate crunch cracker and it had like
sesame seeds on the outside um I just
don't think the combination of melon and
chocolate is going to be good personally
oh wow they're individually wrapped to
their for linear or slowly crap oh my
roses oh good thing we didn't eat before
this I know oh my gosh they're cute the
kind of mine is going to put forth okay
yeah yeah over there like I like melon
dude oh yeah we do huh no one's allergic
are you guys know this isn't a tiny
chocolate on it that's okay actually
refreshing yeah cause it's like puffs
air yeah yeah yeah it's not that's a me
see that's not like this I continue to
like especially if it was a good fruit
like strawberry so I'd be better or just
chocolate or just vanilla well hopefully
banana because we haven't now actually i
would give it like um like I wouldn't
probably purchased it again but I'd
still give it a six yeah I was gonna say
26.2 yeah I would buy it and give it a
nine wow it is pretty good actually wow
this is going different than I thought
sorry I go weird after player I like
about I think Isaac kicks you know just
all regular kicks you know with melon
chocolate we're just going to go for the
banana ones now these are banana
chocolate crunch crackers so they're
like the same thing but banana flavored
which I know I'll probably hate these
because I don't like the name but its
most beat it smells like coconut yeah
yeah whatcha mean what did we expect
mmhmm yeah discovered all right thank
you better than the melon what I think I
like another one way better oh good I
just don't like banana like baked
bananas yeah if you like fake banana you
would love these that's enough bro yeah
I like that it's late look at what you
did not dead yeah okay the camera turned
off so I don't know how much is on there
but this one was absolutely horrendous
the most disgusting probably the
grossest texture I've tasted the top
five I don't even know the other one to
be so i want to say number one but i
think someone would maybe enjoy the tail
maybe it's just so bland but using
gelatin weirdness one it's horrible
negative 20 thank you go it's sick
that's good i don't think i don't think
that they could really they trick you
anything it's chocolate bar when it is
not chocolate yeah then we felt it then
you saw a big pocket of air oh that was
sick yeah yeah okay wait yeah for
reference it's Oh Sam Donna's gonna get
fruit lather that was not the case so
we're on to these things these are the
rice pies and i already opened them
because camera turned off but this is
what they came like so everything is
individually packaged like it's not like
here where you get macaroni and then
inside it's just like Lucy rose your
boss and you're like how much like a
pass you just got on this or whatever
these they are really into packaging so
but then I feel like that's how they
fool you and so
yeah okay I feel like this has got me
like those that one mint chocolate oh
yeah but I think will be more joy inside
um like a min to the jorc yeah yeah
doesn't like you're sorry that's good I
bet yeah the texture it's just cussing
me out let me real classy about it yeah
let's go um the thing about these is
like they're jelly and gushy and you
would think oh it's like a marshmallow
that's awesome it's not a marshmallow
though it's clear gelatin I don't
understand why everything needs to have
the gelatin but it's Lee change you know
because that's how those are it's really
clear like that and it also has often in
the middle like it is so slick see how
stretchy it is you would smelling I'd be
good fun date night with nasty put it in
the trash there we go I give that I'm
the one yeah I want to give it a
negative cuz the other one was like at
least just tasted a little like
chocolate the chocolate that was good
just not the clear ones too oh I think
people could maybe like it I don't
really I don't like it so I get to one I
just don't know why you would do that
and not put like a cracker in there oh
yeah crunchy they put a cookie yeah they
love the gooey goodness I give it a 3
Wow sec though he's a pilot ok I know we
have a couple candies left so we're
gonna do those and then we'll get into
the grocery stuff ok these are Apple
Stowers I think um I don't really know
so I guess they're supposed to be sour
the only thing I can really read these
are individually wrapped inside they're
just loose aware um I know I thought
like they're going hard candies like lu
lu they're all yellow all this smell
pretty good right
they do smell nice like fresh they have
like sugar on the outside like a gun I
do like the smell whoa really oh we're
good texture very good they'll compare
it's a woman the Texans not that bad
compared to what we've been through no
other one that I'd still weird though
they're like a little chemicals like
hairspray or something yeah like yours
really apple and like hair product I
good it's like gardening forties no I
like you're doing it anymore Sam loves
candy yeah they're really the church so
hard yeah I just brother he's a garden
and a fruit yeah if you needed to like
build up jah resistance these would help
you a lot that's like a worn-out piece
of bubblicious yeah but it looks it's
like you're eating a good tasty or good
smelling so like hair yeah let's shampoo
ice punished that's what I hear sofa is
the shampoo haha I couldn't use all
holidays oh if I did I would have been
here too it is but yeah um I give this a
three I guess this is seven and a half
what kind of hair is creepy I didn't I'm
fine see something else soon enough that
was it nearly like this mmm my readings
can cut it out
three Australian there's a consistent
okay now a new face dummies these are
probably the ones I'm most excited for
because get that out and down back into
our lives these are individually wrapped
this is what I come to expect at this
point you don't like peaches it smells
like a real peach though ya tinkin oh
I'm so the gummy but is there no no
honey no no see I can't trust you
because you're part of it has like a
like a powder on the outside almost of
it like it doesn't stick is shining on
the outside like I wanna get silicone I
just heard on the radio this morning and
this dude had a few and then they got
their money on that each in their own if
you have one of those out there you go
but I don't anyone was alright it was
okay it wasn't as good as I wanted it
speak also reminds him a different
chemical or something like weird I just
don't know the outside of it yeah it's a
silly yeah it's weird it tastes like
hand sanitizer if it didn't have the
alcohol taste in it like yeah yeah um I
would still give this to us at a 70 for
peach prl candies 00 alpha six yeah I
don't know I like peach stuff it tasted
more like a real peach than like super
