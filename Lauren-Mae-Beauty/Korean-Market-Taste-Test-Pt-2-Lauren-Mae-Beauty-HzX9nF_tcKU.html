what's he called a red bean cake with
black sesame so it says on the back
caution this product is chewing and
texture already we're scared we're
shaking in our boots here I'm having
chills yeah children especially under
three years of age and elderly people
should be cautious please chew
thoroughly before swallowing now that is
just just scary caution for me why I'm
scared I'm really scared so we're gonna
eat it I'm gonna cut it up oh it smells
like stuff seems like I'm not like
peanut butter or something I don't know
if it's gonna be savory or sweet also
had to be refrigerator show it up there
yeah to be refrigerated that's what it
looks like on the little thing it looks
like a donut hole but I'm gonna be that
good red bean paste inside or like a
sushi you guys okay so again with the
gelatin whole thing I don't know oh yeah
this is gonna gross me out I already
know I don't want to eat this I'm eating
this for you guys it looks like baby
porcupines oh yeah yeah like you're
you're slaughtering a bunch of baby poor
peopie
all the pieces I hate you the right baby
thing is so sticky I don't know if it's
gonna like stick to my finger
look it's sticking to my finger like so
I demand up in here it's like nobody's
bothering it we can't try that okay okay
just why why is this a creation Daniel
water now yeah go William all this first
okay I don't know how I'm gonna freakin
edit this video because I'm insane in it
oh man throw all that away no no now I'm
judging novio baby bag they were okay
like oh yeah those are okay I'm John
Nokia cross-dressing me over they aren't
good this was the absolute worst and if
you voted negative 20 with honey this is
like a negative one thousand 1 million
me infinity if you like these it was I'm
sorry it's Avery like yeah I like it
would be a peanut sauce go on something
I am sorry I'm sorry
um these were just very bad if you like
them I think it's something like again
the texture seems to be a like common
thing like that goopy texture so I don't
know if that's just something like you
just grow up with another customer too
as you grow up but like that I'm someone
who like something crispy and crunchy
and like even chicken like I like it
almost burned still like for me this is
like exact opposite to me this is like
sick so yeah I give it a negative
infinity plus one like there it's the
worst thing I've ever tasted
it's the worst thing you've ever tasted
texture wise especially like maybe not
taste wise but like texture
don't understand why it's a thing
personally I know so many guys might
like it up there so I'm sorry it's not
trying to be offensive it's just my
opinion
I give you props if you could eat the
whole thing if you ordered that knowing
you would eat it that's crazy yeah
that's good
it was so sticky I mean you guys thought
they're hanging from my hand what what I
couldn't even get it off the plate of
this taken to the doctor no so now we're
going to drinks we have five drinks to
see I'm ballsy I'm a children's shop
boss so we are gonna be doing drinks now
we're gonna use our little really classy
and hearty shot glasses here to just
sample some nice drink beverages all
right Cheers
get some more liquid ones first Joey
yeah we'll do the jelly ones locks
because they're gonna be more thick so
if there's like a mist cab while you
push it down in the balls goes in here
so like it's fizzy fizzy is just the box
I'm gonna save that for last it's like
our champagne toast at the end yeah well
you keep wanting everything to be laughs
these are really good I just don't know
ever by God chosen it I don't know I
don't know my friend had some other
flavor but it was good okay well we're
yeah yeah do it let's handle this
situation that's my favorite drink yeah
yeah oh good
first thing series we're gonna do the
two jelly pouches this is lychee
flavored and it's a fruits jelly drink
yeah
we're not excited I've never really had
the lychee flavor I don't know what Li
Jie's tastes like okay I won't pour
myself first
here's a white thing it's like a
jellyfish maybe that's cool
should we check into separate this trick
you don't get any of the jellies Oh Oh
where'd you get more or less no no no
because if you only got jelly okay I'm
so scared
I'm sorry I don't want to be
inappropriate can we shake it up because
um yeah like a Christmas fruitcake no
it's really sick that smells good though
what does okay we're super shot I'm not
drinking all of it
I'm not shooting this I'll throw my
camera at the really exit look at that
red dot do you see that
maybe it's poison okay I can't know the
taste is okay the texture is the
grossest thing it's like you're drinking
like moldy milk
it's like if you're thinking happier
Intel oh yes I can use like your drink
it's hair gel
yeah it's like fruit flavor and hair gel
so that's it you're in you're into that
lychee jelly drink it's legit jelly I'm
not gonna cream you there's solid
particles in this hair gel I feel like
that'd be perfect
did you drink this right I'm sorry you
know I put it in my mouth I put the
taste the texture in my mouth and I knew
that those little particles those those
state of my mouth I don't know what they
are that was disgusting where's the lid
to use maybe it's Chum right through to
the trash is throw it in the trash I'm
sorry I'm not trying to be a weenie
I just can't students a little too
weenie yeah that sounds good no no no
I'm just gonna tell everyone we're not
drinking it it's you're gonna happen we
might as well donate it to something
before opening it and hating it
next we're doing this 2% peach drink so
it should hopefully be good will you
open it he says one peach everything I
know all the peaches the like most
little fruit with the longest history in
the Orient read that off the package
coming out with Pat's
yeah I thought that'd be like telling
again okay the texture on that one
y'all and this is not like this okay
like I'm okay with it
these kind of like alcohol like yeah
like nothing about the actual rubbing
alcohol yeah like I feel like it's like
an alcoholic peach tree without dog just
like liquefied peach rings those candies
yeah but not as sweet good thing yeah
like water darling no vitamin water
peach yeah yes but like thicker
what do you read this oh the other one I
read Italy is out there in space with
the bean thing dear torture device it
was it was bad this is good I would give
it an eight
I had given for I wouldn't buy it for
myself I give it a five yeah if I was
over somewhere where they were selling
this and I couldn't read anything else
I'd be like yeah I don't know this one
and I get this great review should we do
your favorite yeah a lo the pulpy aloe
no the Pope I got first okay
everybody's trying to cook like one of
my classmates and I was like I wanted
that I'll try it and I tried it and then
I can taste it the pope and at first I
thought she backwash but then I looked
at the bottle and I was like okay
there's too much and it's actually good
I like and they come in like different
flavors of like pomegranate and just so
this tastes like Allen yeah this is the
aloe drink so we're gonna go for it
we're gonna go for all of its pulpy good
already has great reviews from Lupe
likes it so sounds like she's gonna get
in on this sounds like the purple fun
did you see how are you Oh your
reactions I like it even with the Pope
yeah it's like when you drink a lemonade
or something like the flesh of a lemon I
do like it yeah it's a little sweet it's
pretty sweet
like I said I think it's kind of like
the purple fun dip it is and I like that
it's not carbonated sure no it's good
I'd give it a seven now give it a
hundred oh okay this is the last stream
of the final item this is a carbonated
drink in this flavor coconut now Lupe
again she's tried this she's so
adventurous and she said that there's
this ball that comes down and it fizzes
or something I just don't know how you
get our reading instructions there's
like five steps okay yeah yeah it says
how to open remove the seal from the top
detach the plunger yes from the center
of the cap place the plunger on the
bottom on the top
the bottle press down firmly with the
base of the palm to release the marble
throw away the seal cap and plunger have
fun drinking I still know what it asked
me to do I can't
that's the marvel okay you have to push
that plunger down and break the seal to
be sure you have to the Sphinx you can't
have what you have to write all this and
you can't drink less you get the plunger
down press firmly down with the base
there's no marble there's the marble in
our drain shape of the glass keeps it in
the glass yeah keeps it up at the top
that's crazy
why no what's the marble do it fizzes
stops it from coming out okay we're
gonna pour it I guess oh that's fizzy
it's not like coconut well yeah yeah
that's good this would be good in like a
mixed drink it tastes like a yeah like a
pina colada or what yeah yeah yeah just
not as creamy more carbonated I get rid
of mine I don't give it a sec okay well
that's everything guys I hope you
