Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another let's
do pit I do have a whole series of these
and I'll leave the playlist link down
below if you want to check it out in
this series I like to look at palettes
that are coming out and tried to dupe
them with shadows that are already in my
collection I personally like to use
single shadows because I can rearrange
them and make it look exactly like the
palette and for me that's what's so
exciting about new palettes is the
different color stories that are being
told combining different finishes and
whatnot so this is a way I can do that
with shadows that I already have in my
collection now I'm going to be showing
you what I have but I definitely suggest
looking within your Home Collection
seeing if you have things I haven't said
it yet but the palette that I'm going to
be duping is the Kylie cosmetics new
palette the blue honey palette it looks
so stunning the pictures of a just drop
today and I've already had requests to
do it let's do Pitt on it so I thought
I'm already filming why don't I just
pick the shades real fast and I'll show
you guys what I have if you want this
palette that is great I think it looks
beautiful the swatches that I have seen
and look amazing so I get it but if you
are wanting to look within your
collection maybe get some inspiration
from shadows you already have or you
only like a couple shadows hopefully
this can give you some inspiration now
that being said these are not exact
dupes I do not have the palette in front
of me I'm just going based off of
swatches I've seen online and I try to
keep the spirit of the palette the same
I feel like I've done a good job with
finishes so if it's a matte it is a
matte if it's a shimmer it is a shimmer
although the shimmers in this palette
look absolutely stunning and I'm not
sure if mine can stand up to it exactly
so I think that's enough of an intro I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
let's get into these shadows alright so
just to give you guys an idea this is
what my blue honey palette looks like
I'm really excited because I feel like
the shade that's going to be the most
exciting is this one here and I think I
have a nice dupe for it it might not be
as like sparkly shiny but I think the
flash of that golden with the blue is
gonna be what you're looking for anyway
so let's just get into it I will mention
bonus shades as I have them and show you
base watches and whatnot so since the
pictures of this palette dropped today I
do not have shadowing
but I do know that this palette will be
available January 23rd just to let you
know I'm gonna have a picture of it up
here in the corner as well so you can
follow along with the shades that I'm
talking about but I don't have names to
reference anyway the first shade I want
to talk about is the matte cream that's
in the palette this one is from
colour-pop and it's the shade folds it I
do have a full-size single of it it's a
great matte cream shadow but if you have
the yesplease palette from colour-pop it
is also in that palette just to let you
guys know so I think any matte cream
shade is gonna do for this so I'm sure
you have one of those in one of your
palettes at home but I always think a
matte cream shade is nice for a palette
so I don't like fault it it's not like a
bad thing I'm just saying you probably
have one the next shade in here is
probably the coolest out of everything
it's a really pretty like pewter and I
feel like when you look at the swatches
compared to the picture of the palette
there's a lot different there's a lot of
difference so when I look at this just
in the palette it definitely looks very
similar to this shade but when I look at
it in the swatches it does turn a little
bit more rosy I think this is a stunning
shadow this is snake eyes from
colour-pop
this to me is the best match when it
comes to finish of these metallics at
least based off the photos this has a
very sparkly shiny finish and I think
it's absolutely stunning so I do highly
suggest this shade just in general but I
think it's a nice match for the color in
the palette I do have a bonus shadow for
the pewter color in the palette so this
one is from colour-pop it's high-strung
if you are wanting something not quite
as cool toned as snake eyes this one is
beautiful again it's a shadow I talked
about a ton on my channel just stunning
I can't get over this shadow oh look at
that it's so pretty I just sounded like
a freaking bird because it's so pretty
next we have a really beautiful matte
yellow shade and I chose to put in paper
tiger from colour-pop all of these are
from colour-pop so far I think this is a
great shade it's gonna make a nice
transition for a lot of these colors
it's something interesting and different
I really like that she included this
color in the palette it just gives it a
little bit of extra mmm this shade from
colour-pop is super nice and just like a
classic mustard color I don't know if
mustards really classic but it's
absolutely stunning the one in there
could be a little bit lighter yellow but
I think this one will work really nicely
if you have the shade chickadee from
makeup geek that one's gonna be kind of
similar as well so you could try that
one out or you can look into your
subculture palette if you have that and
try one of the yellows in there I don't
know if it's a new way for one of them I
think that would be a really pretty dupe
as well we're moving fast I love that
this only has nine colors in it so next
is another metallic shade this one's so
pretty and I feel like this one also
looks different when it comes to the pan
and when it comes to the swatches in the
pan it looks more of a bronze but in the
swatches it looks like a yellow gold
so I'm ignore with the bronze because I
don't have a classic yellow gold in a
single shadow it's something I
definitely need but this one is from
Coastal Scents and this is the shade
no.23 I believe the real name of this is
new penny but I think this is a stunning
shadow I know that Coastal Scents
doesn't get talked about a lot but this
shadow specifically is absolutely
stunning it's a great metallic highly
suggest it this retails for a dollar 98
or something
such an amazing price but I do have a
few bonus shades to tell you guys about
the first one here is board shorts from
colour-pop this is again in that bronzy
vein I think this is just an amazing
shadow in general it's so just metallic
and beautiful I think you complements
the other shades and the palette really
well although I'm not sure how yellow
gold this is to match the shade in the
Kiley palette and the closest match I
feel like I have is this one from itsy
and this is the shade Gold Coast I will
leave this linked obviously down below
if I if they still sell it this
definitely has that yellow shining
through and I think it's a pretty nice
shadow it has a lot of that sparkle to
it as well which i think is great I
don't know where I was with this because
I got that call I'm sorry guys but I do
really like this if it's not limited
edition I'm gonna leave a link down
below
obviously with everything else alright
moving on to the center shade in the
palette this one is absolutely stunning
it's a mat like bluish green now again
in the palette it looks like it's a blue
but when I've seen it's watched it
looked a little bit more green this one
from itsy I think is perfect for it it's
a matte and it's called a weekend
getaway it's so
beautiful and I think if that was the
shade you wanted you could get this and
you would be set so I love this I think
it's really nice it's a really silky
matte shave you can build it up but it's
still pigmented and you can get full
color if you want to as well so this is
one I suggest for the center shade I
don't have a name
another beautiful shadow that's giving
it that blue honey name this is the
shade lakeshore from Coastal Scents and
this one is one of my favorite shadows
from Coastal Scents I have a whole video
dedicated to my top 15 shadows and this
one was in it this has a beautiful
texture it's a heavier shadow it almost
feels like those makeup forever shadows
although now they happen reformulated so
I haven't felt the new ones this is a
duochrome where it has a blue with a
golden shift to it
it's just absolutely stunning it doesn't
have as much sparkle as the other one
but it is highly metallic I love the
shadow and for 198 you can't beat the
price moving on to the bottom row of the
palette the next shade is a matte and I
feel like this one you could probably do
put a lot of different colors I chose to
use the shade Pharaoh from Luxy Beauty I
think their mats are really nice and
they have a lot of really trendy colors
this one is a very nice warm toned like
terra cotta but it's a little bit more
Orange absolutely stunning I think this
would be really nice it was hard to tell
in the picture where the depth was on
this so more than anything I try to just
make it match in difference with the
depth of the other matte shade that will
be coming last so I think that one's
really nice but honestly you could go
into your modern renaissance and find a
shade in there I think that would work
really nicely
the last shimmer shade that I have here
this is the shade red stone from Coastal
Scents when I was looking at the
pictures the red was a really pretty red
but it had an orange base to it it do go
to purple so I think this one would be
really really nice again it would pair
nicely with the other shadows that are
in here this one from Coastal Scents
again is gonna be super affordable
because it's Coastal Scents
but another dupe I was thinking about if
you happen to have the Natasha Jeannot
Leela palette I did do one of those
shadows with this shadow in a past let
stupid so I would check that out if you
have that palette you probably have a
very so
our color to that and then just to throw
this in there this is another bonus
shade in its flamethrower from makeup
geek this definitely is a lot more
orange than it is red but it's
absolutely stunning I think it would
pair really nicely with the palette and
if you have this already you can
definitely make some similar looks and
the last shadow in the palette this one
here is the color maple and again it's
from luck see beauty I think this is
beautiful it's gonna deepen up any of
these looks in this palette I think
it'll pair nicely with Faro as well with
picking the shadow I really wanted to
match it to some of the red or more like
yeah
corely undertones that were coming from
the swatch of this color so I think this
one is beautiful if you were wanting
some bonus shades I did want to mention
the other look see shadow that's kind of
in between Faro and maple and that is
the shade terracotta this one's a little
bit more orange I'll swatch it out for
you guys so it's there it's very very
similar it's slightly less a deep but I
chose to go with the deeper one so there
was more contrast between the two mats
in the palette those are the color dupes
that I have in my collection now I know
if you don't have a bunch of single
shadows it might be more expensive to
buy all of these shadows and is to buy
the Kylie palette so I get that if you
don't have a lot of these the Kylie
palette might be the reasonable choice
for you and I haven't seen any swatches
it might just be totally different when
it comes to finish and shimmer and just
be oh so extraordinary but if you go
back to my other let's do pits you can
see that a lot of the times I'm reusing
the same shades over and over in my let
stupid because a lot of the colors are
very very similar and I think that's
something that's very telling about the
eyeshadows that are coming out and about
how large our collections are so I hope
this helped you either find a specific
color dupe or look within your own
collection and get inspired with what
you already have also for this I do not
have a demo I know I try to usually do
that but I had already done my makeup I
was not expecting to film this today I
just thought I would real fast so I hope
you guys enjoyed the video other than
that let me know what you guys think
about the palette down below in the
comments and I will see you guys in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
