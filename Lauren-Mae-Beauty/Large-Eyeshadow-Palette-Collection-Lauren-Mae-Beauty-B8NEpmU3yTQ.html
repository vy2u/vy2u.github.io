Lauren this is going to be my large
palette collection video I basically
took everything that I keep in my large
palette drawer in my makeup collection
and I'm going to show it to you guys
today this is a part of my makeup
collection series I will leave my other
videos linked down below this isn't to
brag or anything I just thought it'd be
fun to show you guys what I have in my
collection and as part of my project
panning goal for the year I really want
to focus in on the items already have in
my own collection and be excited about
them so this is a way for me to
rediscover things in my collection to
get excited about things I already own
and hopefully just shop my stash and use
up some of my products so let's just get
into the palace that I own I'm gonna try
to go by brand but I have a lot of
palettes
no one needs as many palettes I am just
an eyeshadow palette junkie it's my
number one favorite thing if I go on and
makeup website that's the first thing I
look at is like new makeup and then if I
go to makeup and just shopping make up
makeup palettes like I love them I love
palettes we'll start off with lorac
because lorac is one of my favorite
eyeshadow brands and just I just really
like lorac shadows I really like their
formulation the first palette I have
here is the lorac Pro this is the
original as you can see mine has a lot
of love I've hit pan on three shades
this is one I suggest to like everyone
and love that it's half Matt 1/2 shimmer
I love the tones of it I just I really
like this palette if you don't have a
lot of eyeshadow and you're looking for
something that can get a lot done
easy day ten loads dramatic night looks
this is one for you I also have the
lorac pro 2 this is considered like the
cooler tone version of that other
palette of the first one I don't think
it's particularly that cool I think
there are a lot of nice warm shades in
here I really like this palette I don't
think it gets enough love from like the
first one I feel like the more I've used
this the more I've fallen in love with
the colors in here and I have hit pan on
two of the shades in this one as well so
I really like this one too I just really
like them all guys I like them all let's
go into the mega pros shall we I have
the lorac mega pro 1 I have hit pan on
one of the shades in here that is
espresso up in the corner I love this
palette I keep this in my kit and
I use it quite a bit in there it's just
nice it's neutral it's not too warm it's
not too cool I just really like this
palette I'm gonna say that to every
single one on I'm sorry and then I also
have the lorac mega pro 2 this one I
think I like the tones in it I don't
know I just like particular shadows
better than that one I really liked
burlap I love melon I love tangerine I
love tawny this lavender shade it's
really pretty I was using it in my brows
for a long time this one was just a
really nice one I'm glad that this one
is more accessible than the last one
that came out and if they come out with
another one I'm definitely gonna get it
let's not forget about the an zipped
palette both of those do this is the
original unzipped palette from lorac I
love this palette I love the rosy shades
in here I think this one is better than
the Naked 3 palette I just like the
quality of these shadows better I really
like this palette so pretty I've used
probably the shade unreal the most out
of everything in here and when the gold
came out I had to get it I really wanted
this mostly for the Unleashed color
which is this crazy bronze I know
everyone talks about it but it's because
it's insane it's literally crazy town
like it's so pigmented I love it this is
a great palette some of the shades are a
little bit flakier than others and this
isn't the same formula as her other
shadows I still like it but that is that
it's definitely different than the like
pro formula and my la siroque palette
this one is the afterglow palette I know
they come out with these in like the
summertime that's it there I think this
is a really fun palette the pigmentation
isn't the most insane ever I definitely
need to bust this out more but I do I
like this palette let's do er bin' decay
next I feel like that's the next most
that I have I have all three of the
naked palettes this is the Naked one
this is my first high end palette ever
bought because everyone talked about it
so I don't know why I haven't hit pan on
any of the shades because virgin instant
I used all the time I used to make it
quite a bit too but I love this one it's
my favorite one out of all three of them
this is my naked 2 palette this is
definitely cooler tone but it does have
some warm shades in there - I just don't
gravitate to this palette enough I
should use it more and just like test it
out but this would be my least favorite
out of all of them I
kind of regret purchasing this like if I
I wouldn't go out and buy this if I
didn't have it right now that makes
sense the same kind of goes for the
naked 3 I think it's pretty and I get
why other people like it but I just
don't use it as much as I should and if
I didn't have this in my collection I
wouldn't go out and repurchase this this
is a limited edition palette that came
out with the Oz movie this is the Glinda
the Good Witch palette that's what the
shades look like oh I switched to
offshoot anyway half the normal shades I
switched them out because these are part
of their like you know switching shades
which I really like with the limited
edition packaging I can reuse it with
other shades and kind of switch it up
but anyway I do have this one it's a
nice palette I got it on sale on Urban
Decay's website for $20 and that's why I
bought it I mean I don't regret it I
think that they're great shades but I'm
glad I got it on a deal for sure the
electric palette is like one of my
favorite palettes it's one of my top 5
palettes that I own I just love these
shades I love that they came out with
something bright and colorful it's not
overly glittery like a lot of their
shades are and I just love having shades
that if I want color I don't have to
worry about oh it's not gonna show up
true to color I don't have to worry
about building these up too much they
just crazy pigmented on their own so I
love this palette if you even like color
a little bit I feel like you could have
this and be done because you can kind of
mix stuff in here it's so good I love
this I'm gonna have a bunch of ice
pallets so we'll start with the Vice 3 I
think that's the oldest one I have this
is the vice 3 I love this one this is
probably my favorite one out of all the
vice palettes I have I just really like
the shades in here I really like this
whole like warm column I love that they
do a range of mattes and shimmers and
just different colors they're so fun I
know a lot of people don't like the way
that they were like situated in the
palette but I don't mind it I think it's
kind of fun it makes you be creative and
then this is the vice 4 palette I also
love this one I love the pinks in here I
think those are so fun and I think this
is a great palette as well I just I love
them
I'll probably get the vice palette that
comes out this next year which I'm sure
one will and then this is my least
favorite vice palette that I own this is
the Vice Ltd I don't like the shadows in
here
I think they're kind of boring I think
there's more chunky shadows in here
there's a few I like like I like these
three here I like this pink shade and
that's kind of it I like this coppery I
got shade I don't know I bought this
just to have it this is like one of the
palettes I regret buying and that I know
I bought just as like a collector
instead of like in a practical way so I
kind of wish I didn't buy this and I
don't suggest it out of all of them but
I do own it I guess I'll show it to you
because I own it I think that's all my
urban decay let's move on to Kat Von D I
have a lot of Kat Von D shadows this is
a Kat Von D star-studded palette this
came out with holiday of 2014 I believe
has a nice little thing I don't really
like these I guess that much but that's
what the shadows look like I have never
really used this I have this in my
project pan drew light this year trying
to hit pan on it on one of the shades in
here so yeah we'll see how that goes I'm
probably gonna do a palette bingo with
this soon which will be fun so I'll
leave my other palette bingo that I've
done down below with my advice for I
definitely feel like out of this one and
the one that came out for holiday this
year the me vida loca is the best choice
this is the me vida loca speaking of it
maybe the look of remix palette that's
what the shadows look like I love the
finishes the colors everything about
this it's such a good well-rounded
palette no pun intended but it's just a
really good one this is the monarch
palette from Kat Von D they are
discontinuing this so I don't know if
you can still get it right now that's
what it looks like I have not used this
nearly as much as I thought I would I
really like this rest shade and so when
I saw this I wanted it but now I have so
many palettes with that rest shade
because it's like the color that dropped
me into every palette I definitely need
to bust this out more I like the quality
of her shadows I just haven't used it
this is a Kat Von D Esperanza palette
and I really like this palette there's a
lot of chunky glitter in it and I wish
that wasn't the case but I still really
like it I probably won't ever get rid of
it placebos are really nice matte coral
and that's something a little bit
different this was a limited edition so
you can't get it now and
I really like it I believe I have a
tutorial using this it's like old but
I'll leave it linked down below to more
pallets from Kat Von D I didn't realize
I had so many this is the inner stellar
palette I got this I am NOT a cool-toned
person I don't really love cool toned
eyeshadows but for some reason I just
wanted to get this so I did I've used it
a couple times it's nice I like the
quality I definitely could use it more
I'm trying to branch out to use cool
tone shades but I mean I just love pinks
and browns that are like nice and warm
it's hard it's hard for me to use these
but I really do like this palette I'm
not gonna get rid of it or anything and
last is another limited edition palette
they don't have this anymore this is the
Kat Von D ladybird it's an all matte
palette really pretty shades so buttery
so creamy I don't think I've ever used
this on my eyes which is the saddest
thing ever to me I need to bust this out
and use it it's too pretty not to use I
could even put this in my kit just cuz
it's all mattes I really like this I
need to use it I need to use it guys
let's do some Tarte palettes I have four
pallets from Tarte I have decluttered
quite a bit so I used to have a couple
more but I got rid of some my favorite
one that I own is the target rain forest
after dark palette this has gotten quite
a bit of love no pan yet but I've used
so much of the bronzer the highlighter
the blush color so pretty and then these
are just even though these are more cool
tone shade these are the types of cool
tones that I really like I love the gold
with the purple I thought this was just
a really well done palette and I really
enjoyed it and because of this palette I
got a bunch of other circular disk
palettes because I wanted them all to be
that great this one is limited edition I
honestly can't remember if this one came
out before that palette or not but this
is the aqua lilies for Tarte palette and
I have hit pan on two of the shades I
did that this year I'm so proud of it I
really like this palette I was searching
high and low for this palette so I
definitely don't think I've used it
enough for how bad I wanted this but I
do like it and I do want to get more use
of this palette but I'm so happy to see
some progress in it and the last
circular one I have this is the Tarte
showstopper palette I don't think this
is limited edition I think you can still
get it
I didn't need this I probably shouldn't
have ordered it I went a little crazy
and got it it's nice and I'm gonna try
to use it it's not one that I'm just
like head-over-heels for though out of
everything I own in my collection I
would just recommend other things more
than this
and the last Tarte palette I have this
is the Tarte tartlet palette I ordered
this on like presale before it like
released all the way I was so excited
for this because it was an all matte
palette I liked the colors I've never
I've used this maybe twice I don't even
think I've used it I don't know why I
don't use this I need to I think I could
even use this in my kit again because
it's all matte this is something I
really want to bust into this year and
like make some panin and see if I want
to keep it next I have Anasazi Beverly
Hills this is the Miah Miah palette and
I really like this palette I love the
shades in here nice and warm I hit pan
on caramel earlier this year I really
like this palette and I'm glad I have it
it's limited edition although some of
the shades you can still get in singles
this is a tamanna' palette I think it's
how you say it again nice and warm I
like that warm with the pop of blue I'll
take it
I really like the color sangria this is
one I also want to like hip and on a
couple of shades in this year really
nice palette I think it's just a
well-constructed palette for everything
you get that finishes the colors it's
really good I really want to get the
modern renaissance palette so bad I'm I
mean I'm going to I just need to do it
and the last palette I have here this is
the lavish palette this is like an old
palette I heard so many people raving
about this and I wanted to get my hands
on it when it came out and I love it
I've you so much this is cream a hippie
Anan
orange sodas one of my all-time favorite
shades ever in like any eyeshadow ever
and then Sienna I also really like it's
just a good one I really like this
palette and I've obviously used it a ton
I have a few Stila palettes as well this
is gonna be my oldest palette from them
this is the steal of her Kardashian
Khaos it only has four shades in it
these are really nice shadows I really
like them they're very pigmented it's
like a really easy quad if you just have
to bring some shots with you you could
bring this and do
so much I feel like you'd get a very
easy everyday luck with this I just like
it I haven't been able to get rid of it
and I think the quality is good so
obviously it's limited edition you can't
get this anymore I have two of the
window eyes are the window shadow
palettes this is the soul palette I
really like this palette it's more cool
toned Browns or more neutral Browns but
I really like it I used it on my wedding
day it has kitten in it which i think is
really nice if you like shimmery Browns
I think this is a really good neutral
palette and then this one is the mind
palette this is the all matte palette I
have hit pan on this shade here which is
reason again that rest shade I mean it
gets me on every palette I really like
it I think it's really good
for more palettes to go I told you I
have a lot guys this is the Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette I think
it's my only Too Faced palette which
seems kind of crazy but I think I've
just declared stuff and I didn't ever
really have many of these like pan
shades oh I have two chocalate bar but I
got rid of it because I don't ever use
it so anyway I love this palette this is
like my favorite thing ever so cute so
fun I love the shades I love how warm it
is and I'm totally the person that puts
like that purple color with warm shades
I feel like people like to do like cool
toned purple looks I love a warm purple
look oh I love it so this is just my
palette I love it so much so good this
is a smaller palette but I keep it with
my larger palettes even though donuts
for shades in it turn makeup forever
this was like a already curated palette
I didn't pick these shades out I don't
know why I just wanted this so bad I
think because it was it was cheaper to
get the four shades because it was
already in a palette and I wanted to try
out the formula
I like the formula on these they're very
pigmented and like thick without feeling
like too clumpy if that makes sense like
it doesn't feel like there's a lot of
product on your fingers but they're nice
and rich and thick if that doesn't make
sense but it does if you feel these I do
like this I don't use it enough when I
first got it I used it a couple times
and then I put it away I never got it
back out so I need to bust that out this
is the Laura Mercier palette and this is
the I forget like the artist palette I
think I've
this on the original release which is
weird because I'm not really like a
laura mercier fan I don't really follow
what they came out with I just saw this
and wanted it and then it became like
this coveted thing really pretty shades
again it's more that purpley Brown type
of thing African violets really pretty I
really like the color fresco it's
probably the one I use the most out of
here it's nice I do like it you can get
these in singles though so if you just
like a couple shades I would just go
with a couple singles instead of having
all of them in the last palette I think
this is the last one guys I didn't
include any of my Z palettes in here
because I feel like it's like a separate
thing this is the NARS narcissist dual
intensity eyeshadow palette I think
they're coming out with a second one of
these I like this but I don't love it I
wish I didn't get it just cuz of how
pricey it is and how little I've used it
I'm trying to hit pan I think I've
decided on this shade here this year in
my project pan roulette it's what I have
on my eyelids today it's pretty don't
get me wrong but it's not anything that
amazing to me and I tried using it wet
and it just felt like my eyelids looked
really like wrinkly and like cracked and
stuff I don't know it's okay I just feel
like basically I could just use a quad
and just use this quad instead of all of
these dark shades too anyway that's that
palette and that's my final palette
that's everything all my larger
eyeshadow palettes that I own I don't
really own any drugstore large eye
shadow palettes just because I feel like
they're expensive and I haven't heard
just a hundred percent positive reviews
on them I just don't think it's worth if
I'm gonna spend twenty dollars I'd
rather go get like a nice single that I
love or by makeup geek stuff so that is
everything I hope you guys enjoyed I
will see you in my next video let me
know down below what you want to see
next and I'll see you bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
