Lauren this is going to be the final
series unless I go through my like
skincare and haircare stuff I might do
that but when it comes to makeup this
may be my final series on my
decluttering I'm really really hoping to
do some damage I'm kind of scared but
I'm excited so if you want to watch my
video clutters from this like time
around I will leave them all in the
description box for you to check out
let's just get into it I have a lot of
Talas eyeshadow palette - probably one
of my favorite things or used to be I
feel like I'm Way more into singles like
you know individual pop singles now
we'll see what I keep and when I get rid
of so I have gone through and separated
them all out by brand I'm gonna start
off with my Urban Decay I realize they
really only have three main brands
I have urban decay Kat Von D lorac and
then I have like a couple randoms and
then my individual Z palette it's kind
of crazy I have a declutter
that I will link down below like my eye
shadow house when I first started my
channel and I had so many more palettes
I just learned what I like I think
that's the biggest thing one when you
get premade palettes it's whatever is in
there so my style everyone sells their
own so I'm learning what I do like what
I don't like formulas all that hips up
anyway um yeah let's get into it I have
the vice palette here so I have device 3
device for and the Vice ltte I can
hardly tell you I'm going to be getting
rid of this one I do not like this
palette honourably does none of these
colors are my favorite red stripe I know
L you love this color and it is it's a
beautiful color down specifically but
yeah in a whole palette as a whole is
not something that inspires me
I don't feel excited to use it has a lot
of those chunky glittery shame I don't
know how L use this whole thing up so
I'm going to getting rid of that I have
the Vice 3 and the vice 4 palette here
my goal is to kind of want to keep one
of these in two days can see I kind of
only want to keep one of these so I
don't even know guys I think I'm gonna
get rid of both of them I'm getting rid
of both of them yeah I can't do it
um I just they're getting old I don't
know if they're just getting older I
just I've changed your life but yeah I'm
getting rid of them it's just I don't
think it's fun to use them you know like
it's way more fun to me to have my like
single shadows I like I have my naked
palette and I have my Urban Decay
electric palette I am keeping an
electric palette I love this palette I'm
status being discontinued I think it's
so good I don't know why they're
discontinuing it it's way better than
the after dark palette trying to focus
love this
keeping Naked palette now I don't really
like the Naked 2 or The Naked 3
I'm gonna open them up and see but I
have a feeling I'm going to get rid of
the Naked 3
I don't like this College this is the
Naked 2 I think this was nice for like
other people I feel like it looks good
on other people but not necessarily on
me I just feel like I can get these like
cool tone really pretty colors like in
single form so I'm gonna get rid of sin
Naked 2 and last the naked one I know
everyone talked to how much they love
this and I did love it at one point but
it's just not this it's not it's not
number one anymore and I'm getting rid
of it as well
tada ok so now I have one or two key
passes yeah I'm getting rid of all those
someone will be really excited to get
that in my family and I'm happy I can
give someone else that joy but not me
man I remember when a random pellet just
because I want to break this is the Ben
Nye media Pro powder palette there's
like a light women this is like the
darker one I'm keeping this I keep it in
my kit obviously this doesn't work for
me but I do like that though even that
this is my ice cream palette from dosa
colors I really do like this so I will
be keeping this pellet I have the violin
Voss Pro palette I got this as gratis
for working at I'm at and I do really
like it I think this is really nice I'm
going to keep this the quality of this
is just so much better than even those
Urban Decay ones like I feel really
happy with my students I'm teasing that
this is the captain like morphe palette
I really like this as well I'm gonna
keep this guy because Italy be more my
style maybe I've just changed a lot you
know I don't know what it is but
you know when I've seen more joy from a
15-dollar kathleenlights palette than I
do from Urban Decay vice palette then
that's just the fact of the matter man
hopefully I learned a lesson this is the
Laura Mercier artists palette I am
trying to hit pan on one of the shadows
in here I don't really have anything
cool tones like this and I do really
like these I'm gonna keep let's move on
to lorac I know the lighting is kind of
washing it out so I apologize I have my
lorac one two and three I'm going to be
keeping all these I love them I probably
should replace my lorac one Sam because
it's just getting old but I really do
like these I like the shadow formulation
I love that half of them are matte half
of them are shimmer I know a lot of
people act like the lorac 3 is just like
 but I really like it it's like
super light tone so it's not a very
dramatic look you know it's funny
clients well exactly I want to smokey
eye I want to look glam and honestly
it's like the entire people who actually
want that much makeup on that face is
pretty slim you look at celebrities on
the red carpet most of the time they
have very natural look so just like my
flashes my skin they look glowy and dewy
and just fresh I feel like that's what
this can give you is that's what I'm
trying to go with that story anyway this
is the lorac pro 2 and I really like
this one too I know a lot of people talk
about this thing really cool toned and
it does have some cool tones but like
Rose a beautiful mocha so pretty nectar
and lovin light brown I mean really
great shape I love snow as well as a
highlight so yeah
keeping that these are the lorac
unzipped palette I know for sure I'm
getting rid of these lorac unzipped
original I feel bad I feel sad but you
just don't do for me anymore so getting
rid of that it's just going to old so I
wouldn't use that in my kit either this
is Little Rock's gold palette I'm going
to swatch some of these out I know this
like this shade is like so pretty and it
really is I mean it's crazy but I don't
really wear like warm tones like this
anymore
I'm going to give it I'm going to get
rid of this as well it's just the
forwards not my favorite I can't keep it
for the one shadow then I have my lorac
mega Pro and I do really like all of
these so this is the third one will go
out of order I love this one so pretty
these I usually keep in my kit this is
Little Rock one
have some like more cool tones in here
again it's looking like crazy shabby I'm
so sorry and you clean this um but yeah
I keep that guy and then this is the
lorac pro mega mega pro 2 I also really
like that so I'm going to keep those I
feel like these just have like what I
can actually do to create looks I can do
shimmer I can do Matt I can just do so
much with these so I just think they're
really good to love these next let's
move on to Kat Von D before we go into
my single shot absolute that's how I
feel about this
I'm obviously keeping my music Aloka I
feel like this is like what I actually
like this is beautiful and like the
Urban Decay ones could have been this
that they act had more mats and just
better pigmentation so definitely
keeping that guy loved it argh that girl
this is the metal matte palette and
although I don't use this on myself I do
you think it's a nice palette attention
for other people I don't know I'm not
ready to get rid of it um if I could go
back in time I wouldn't have bought it
type of situation but I do want to try
to get some more use out of it I always
hold on to it for a little bit longer so
I'm going to keep that I have the
interstellar and I have the monarch
palette pillow like I love this it's
really pretty but I never use it
same with this guy I love this it's
really pretty and they're like brand new
I'm going to keep these and maybe put
them again in my like one month one
palette potentially maybe put them in
like it I don't know like this is these
are so soft they would make beautiful
looks like some of these colors would be
so pretty I would love to like actually
use them so I would like to try to like
give these one of those chances where
it's like oh I didn't know I needed you
in my life so I'm going to keep them but
those I'll probably do the next two to
go in my collection if I end up not
using them okay so the last section I
have to go through are my single shadows
now I was contemplating if I should just
keep everything because I have been
doing that less Cupid series but
honestly I do want to like still have
only single shadows I like even if I am
like trying to dupe stuff for you guys
so these are some extra shadows that I
have from look see beauty that did not
fit into my
beauty collet which is this one I'm
going to keep all of these I have a
review coming on these hopefully soon
and I will let you know my thoughts then
but I do want to keep these this is my
everyday Z palette and it's what I'm
panning for the year so I do want to
keep these as well if you want to see my
progress on these I believe my pan that
palette down below for you guys to check
out I don't know guys okay usually these
are like color pop shadows I just don't
like these ones with the glitter in them
so I'm going to get rid of them this is
the color too much
I see all the butters I can't I can't do
it I don't want to do it and then this
one pretty cruel I love the actual like
color but again the glitter just gets me
so I'm going to get rid of those the
rest of these color pops I do really
like I think they're nice they're
pigmented so I'm keep those this is my
Mac palette and I don't have like
anything in there
so for broken-ass shadow so I'm going to
get rid of all of these and I'm just
going to throw in these other ones I
would love to make a Mac palette I do
have quite a few Mac shadows I just need
it by the answers
the store will dispose of the ones we
don't want this is really the palette I
need to like go through I don't know
maybe I won't do this right now
I just think you Eternals like them all
I don't know I'm not in the mood to do
it I thought I was and I'm really not so
the if you want to see the tours I think
the only one I have filmed it is my
pinks in purple so I believe that went
down below it shows everything flushed
and it gives you the names of all the
colors I don't even know how well you
can see it because of the lighting so
I'm really sorry this is like more cool
toned Browns I'm going to keep that for
now I have my yellows oranges gold
Fred's here and then last this is like
my blues and greens so I guess I'm just
going to keep those I don't know why I
thought I had a little bit more than I
did so yeah I'm going to keep those and
just get rid of basically these ones I
am very very happy with
what I did what I did sure today guys I
got rid of some you know I feel like
some baggage with that urban decay stuff
with that lorac stuff that's hard that's
hard for me even right now you know like
a little bit kind of sad to me let me
show you what I'm getting rid of these
are the pallets I'm getting rid of you
know like these make me sad this is like
I remember getting this in the mail I'm
so excited for it but just realistically
now I don't use it I don't want to use
it and I don't keep things for
sentimental reasons stupid I mean if you
want to do that you can do whatever you
are anything for me it just doesn't feel
right to bog down my drawers advise
pallets make me super sad because these
are $60 piece and I bought them both to
that so this is like $120 just wasted
you know same with this like I never
even use this I never even had love for
basically from the beginning I bought
this from like straight crazy impulse
and then these guys I thought I liked
and just you know with time and as stuff
gets better they're not that good and
there's no reason to hold on to them I
ended up getting rid of eight pallets I
think that's pretty dang good
and then these shadows episode I hope
you enjoyed vista clutter series and i'm
excited to see you all again like
actually face to face on camera
oppressive um I'll have video for you
tomorrow and I will see you then bye
