channel I thought that I would do one
last purge before the end of the year
and just get rid of those last few
things that I really can let go of in my
makeup collection I also went through my
nail polish I only have a couple but
it's something right let's be positive
before the new year I want to have a new
makeup inventory and I have some really
awesome goals that I'm setting up for
myself I'm really excited for it so I
thought I would get rid of the last few
things that I feel like I can part with
and then after this I'm gonna really
focus on using the makeup I have I've
purged I've purged I've purged the rest
of the stuff in there I mean I'm sure I
could purge again but a lot of it is
stuff that I like I really like this
stuff so my focus instead of getting rid
of things is going to be using things
next year and I'm really excited about
that I'll talk more about it in another
video but let's get into the rest of the
items I'm gonna get rid of I have four
nail polishes that I'm gonna get rid of
these are things that I like my nail
polishes
I like having big collections you guys
know that I like having a big collection
but I just don't want things in my
collection that I don't use or don't
think I'll gravitate to it all and these
are some of those so this is from OPI
this is polka com I think it came out
with some kind of collection but it's
just like glitters they're bigger and
chunkier and these types of bigger
chunkier nail polishes that have the
glitter don't go on very well you have
to like use so many coats to make it
opaque or it just isn't enough like you
still have to put two coats on on top of
like the two coats of your other polish
and I just don't want to do that so I'm
getting rid of it passing it along this
is a pop you know Polish pop beauty and
is the nail glam and I don't think it
has a name yeah I don't know what the
name is it's hot pink really pretty but
I have other hot pinks I kept this
thinking I would use it but I haven't
and I'd rather use my other ones I'm
getting rid of it this is a so a nail
polish this is in Giovanna I believe and
I got this in some type of bag or
something and I've never used it it's
beautiful really pretty jewel tone teal
but again I have other colors the fact
that I haven't use it just tells me that
I should get rid of it the last one here
is a Sephora nail polish this is the
formula x
in Ex Rouge I got it for being a vib
Rouge which shows that but it's just a
red color I don't gravitate to Reds at
all I like pinks and purples and other
colors better I have one red that I like
and it's more orange II this just isn't
me so I will never wear this so I'm
getting rid of it
I went through my blush palette that
I've depotted and have and I'm getting
rid of four things so the first one here
this is like a tart blush i depotted
this one is in the color blue stellar
and it just has a ton of like shimmers
through it and I have so many of these
Tarte blushes that are tiny that I don't
want to work through this one I'd rather
work through other ones so I'm getting
rid of it and then these three here came
in a pixie big old box thing that i
depotted i've gotten rid of i think
everything else from it and these were
the last three and again i haven't used
them i'd rather reach for other blushes
then use these ones up so I'm gonna get
rid of them
I will be keeping my Z palette though of
course this is an elf brow kit this is
like a backup and I don't use this
anymore so I still have the other one
and now I have this one I went through
one and then I bought two when I
repurchased it want is a backup one to
use so I'm using one again and I'm
getting rid of this one I just have
other things you can use so many things
as brow powders and I have a lot of brow
products at the moment I mean I don't
even do natural brows anymore so I don't
need this in my life
sorry about the swatches I was trying to
determine what to get rid of but I just
don't need this so I'm gonna pass it
along this is a mascara that was in my
products I regret buying I do not like
this this is the full lash bloom from
covergirl had the Katy Perry on the add
it just poked my lashes way too much it
was too hard to like cover my lashes and
I have other mascaras so I'm gonna get
rid of it I have two color pop shadows
in here and that may be surprising I
love color pop but I went through my
collection and I just don't use them and
these colors aren't that great to me and
also one of them was a dupe for one I
already had of color pop what the heck
so this first one here is the color 3
that's it it's pretty but it's nothing
that that special so I'm getting rid of
it someone else can use it
just have so many shadows I'm gonna do a
whole video on that but trust me it's a
lot of shadow the other one I'm getting
rid of is amazing it's a really pretty
color like a neutral champagne color for
the lid but I have a color called summer
lovin that's really similar to this so I
just I don't need like three of these so
I'm getting rid of it and someone else
can use it this is an item that I've
been trying to use up this year but I
just decided that I don't want to and my
life's too short to use this up so this
is the benefit stay flawless 15-hour
primer this thing sucks I've gone over
it it was in my products I regret buying
so I won't get into it I'll just leave
that link down below but this just isn't
good and I don't want to use it up so
I'm gonna get rid of it that one that
one I might have to throw away though
not like pass on just because it's
really dried and it's coming out from
the base so yeah this is a by terry brow
gel I just don't like the way that this
looks like it's goofy and I just won't
use it I'd rather use my honest Asya one
that's just clear and get rid of this
one so I'm getting rid of this I also
have an Ulta one that's way way better
than this - so this is an eyeliner
liquid liner that I kept for forever
because it's really pigmented but it's
blue and blue glitter and although I do
like crazy colors I've never used this I
would never use this on a client like no
it needs to go I do have a few things in
here that have gone bad and they just
need to leave my collection for that
reason which is sad but again another
focus and reason that I want to use up
so much stuff next year is just because
I don't want the stuff I spent money on
to go bad so yeah let's get into those
ones this is the fresh sugar plum tinted
lip treatment I got this with like the
sugar scrub 425 or something a long time
ago it doesn't smell like lemon anymore
it smells like a crayon and that's just
sad so I have so many more of the mini
one so I really need to work through
those next year so they don't go bad on
me this is another one this is the Josie
Maran Argan infinity this used to smell
like kind of lemony as well doesn't
smell lemony when I pull it out like
squeeze it out it's there
separated I was using this product
earlier this year and it was fine and it
must have turned bad between that time
and now so it has to go it's just a mini
but it has to leave and then the last
one here this is the Korres lip butter
glaze this just I don't know I've had it
for a long time I just don't know what
something's off about it I don't know if
it's just me feeling uncomfortable or if
there is a smell or whatever but it has
to go I don't want to use it I haven't
used it and it needs to be thrown out
this is a smoky I don't know six pan
palette little palette from NYX this has
okay colors I got in in a bag or
something like an Ipsy bag and I kept it
for a really long time but I have dupes
of all those colors I don't need to keep
this around and it's gonna go this is a
product I took from work it doesn't even
have a cap I don't know why I took it
because it's glitter probably and I just
love glitter anything sparkly catches my
eye this is pink fire it's a glamour
dust from Too Faced and I just I mean it
doesn't have a lid and I have a billion
glitters I don't need this one and it's
just messy it just has to go I don't
know why I took it one of those things
you know one of those things this is
another glittery type of product this is
the lorac 3d liquid lustre this was on
my list to use up this year but it
didn't work out I didn't want to use it
and it's so dried up and crusty I've
revived this seven hundred times and it
just has to go I it's gold and I don't
want to wear gold even though I have
gold on my lids today but no I don't
want this and it just has to go
sometimes you have to know when to say
one even though it's sad that's how this
product is this is the RMS beauty living
Luminizer I got this in a box from pop
sugar pop sugar does like a box at the
end of the year that's like the girl
luxury box in the guy luxury box and
last year me and Sam got them for each
other and this came in it I was so
excited to get this this is a very
expensive product I think it's in the
$30 range almost $40 for this Luminizer
but I'm never
I got it last year last Christmas so
it's almost a year now never have I used
it and I feel like I'm just keeping it
because of the fact that I know it's
expensive but I don't want to use it
either like it's just not my type of
product so instead of trying to use it
up next year I'm going to pass it along
to someone who can actually enjoy it and
love it instead of me hating it and
complaining to you guys the whole year
about it I have a few foundation samples
that I got from work and I'm just gonna
get rid of them I am NOT a sample person
I have realized more and more it is a
rare few samples that I actually use up
so I think I'm gonna do a giveaway with
all my samples let me know in the
comments if you guys would enjoy
something like that I know it's not like
a match and I'm sorry that it's not like
you know the newest coolest thing but if
you guys want to try some different
things I have a ton of samples and I'm
just gonna get rid of I think all of
them I don't want them so I was thinking
about doing like this big huge sample
giveaway with like different perfume
samples and all this stuff in it let me
know if you guys want to if you would be
interested in like wanting that giveaway
to happen and if you are then I'll make
a video and stuff about it but just like
leave a comment or or like I don't know
something about it so that I can know if
you guys would be interested because if
you wouldn't I don't blame you but my
family and friends don't care about
samples and I know a lot of you guys
love beauty products and would want to
try stuff before you bought it and I
know samples work for most of everyone
else but me I just like don't I'd rather
have the full product I don't know I'm
weird I'm weird I just don't like
samples this is an eye liner from
Sephora I bought this in an eye liner
kit and so so so so long ago this is the
Sephora nano liner it's sparkly black I
have another Sephora eyeliner sparkly
black but it's like twist up so I
already am NOT looking forward to using
it but I don't want to just completely
get rid of it so I'm going to get rid of
this one since it's not as creamy and
not as easy to use so I'm getting rid of
that the rest of the products in here
are all lip products so I really have
been trying to really pare down my lip
collection I just don't like a lot of
lip products and the ones I do like are
the ones that I use over and over again
so instead of trying to work through the
ones I hate I figured that I would just
to work through the ones I loved and get
rid of the ones I don't like so I mean
it seems like it makes sense right
seems like it this is a Tokyo milk dark
get lucky lip tint I've never worn this
it's like a very spicy smell kind of
like I don't know like smoke and
licorice and it's totally not me that
it's not a scent
I mean anything I like so I'm getting
rid of it I kept it because it's Tokyo
milk and I thought that was like a
really cool different brand but I'm
getting rid of it
hello I'm getting rid of two more Revlon
lip butters I regret buying the million
that I bought but I have one left I'm
gonna try to actually use that one up
it's like juicy papaya but these two I
just don't even want to work through I
don't even care the colors don't look
good I just don't like them so men pass
them along these are two J cat's wonder
lip paints the product isn't necessarily
bad on these I bought these because I
thought that they were different colors
and I could use them to do something
outrageous but I just don't use them I
don't like them if I'm gonna do a
different colored lip I'm either gonna
have a really nice product that I like
or I'm gonna like mix it myself and just
use like creams and set it with powder
or something so anyway I just don't I'd
rather have crazy colors in like a matte
liquid lipsticks or whatever so they
just have to go I'm just not gonna use
them and there's just no reason for them
to hang around with me two more let's do
this this is a Fergie lipstick this is
in fuchsia nice stuff there's nothing
wrong with this I just have a couple
other colors like this I have my wife
sell one and number 19 that's very
similar and I just would rather wear the
YSL one than this one so no reason for
me to have it
it's a super great one though like
that's what stained me because it's so
nice and so pigmented and so pretty last
thing this is benefits Benetint I just
don't want this and I don't like it to
use it as a tint on my cheeks I don't
really like it as a stain for my lips
for the color I'd rather do something
like nude or dark or just something else
so it's gonna go and I'm not gonna try
to like torture myself using it up so it
feels good to do
a final clean-out and it feels good to
start fresh for the new year for my new
inventory and kind of my new goals for
my collection and yeah I'm excited for
it
can't wait to share those videos with
you guys they will be coming up soon I
have a lot to film and I'm super excited
for all of December I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day I hope you have a
wonderful holiday I probably will be
posting this sometime after Thanksgiving
so I hope your Thanksgiving was
wonderful I hope that you got to spend
time with friends and family and loved
ones I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
