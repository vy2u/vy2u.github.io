learned thanks so much for watching this
is going to be an update on my finish 17
at 2017 let's do textures I have an
intro and this is my first update so
I'll leave the intro link down below
this is a collab that Claire from
crimson feather started and I will leave
her channel link down below as well as
all the other ladies that are clapping
in this it's a really fun one it's
lasting throughout the year so it's a
long project and I wanted to do
quarterly updates we're all kind of
doing our own updates just because I
didn't know how much progress I'd have
on these items but it's been a quarter
of the year already and I have some good
progress to show you guys so let's get
into the products I'm gonna be going in
order because they all have a different
category and why you're choosing them so
instead of doing like what I've used at
first I'm just gonna go 1 through 17 so
the first product was something that was
inspired by paper and I chose the touch
of blotting papers I am finished with
them let me dig into my basket here I'm
totally done they didn't have many in
there but this has inspired me to get my
own set of blotting papers because it's
really nice to be able to just blot the
oil from your face instead of just
adding more powder on top of it so I'm
glad to finish those up this really
wasn't that big of a deal but it's great
to get one more thing out of my
collection number 2 was cotton and I
chose to put in all of the sheet mess
that I have because though I don't like
sheet masks I just don't enjoyed them
they give me a little bit of anxiety so
I want to get through all my sheet masks
that I have this year I have used up to
so far I believe I had 9 at the
beginning but I think I've added in a
few more at this point so I've used up
two of them I feel great about that they
were okay I don't really have reviews on
these I don't try enough of them to
really know what's amazing so I just
don't feel like my review really matters
what I have left though are three of the
snail jelly bass from skadam this is one
from flora P I decided to throw this in
even though it's on a sheet mask this is
the Fremen facial exfoliating scrub and
pink grapefruit I have a white rose mask
I have some eye patches from Tony moly
and then this is a lemon peel I decided
to throw that in too so I have a more to
go on these guys I think that's
definitely doable
I just actually have to use them so I'm
happy that I have some progress on that
next is leather and I chose my Laura
Mercier artist palette my goal is just
hit pan on one of the shadows in this
palette I've already
hang on - so I just need to pick one
more I have not honestly used this at
all
I'm working on my pan that palette and
I'm gonna make this one of the companion
palettes soon and I think I'm gonna try
to work on any color plum smoke I really
do like that color I think it'd be nice
to hit pan on that the next category was
fruit / flowers and I chose a candle and
it's gone this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
and this is the scent sundress this was
nice nothing amazing but I'm glad I got
use out of it I'm glad I finally used it
up this was sitting in my collection for
so long and it's finally done now so
I've been moving on to other candles and
it been a lot better at burning candles
to hopefully work through my collection
the next category was wood and I chose
the Tarte Amazonian clay powder
foundation because of the wood top I
haven't used this at all this is
something I need to use in the summer
more because it's a little dark for me
so once my skin tans up a little bit I
definitely I'm going to use this I'm
also going to try to use this just on
the outer portions of my face and see if
that's the way I can work through this
the next category was sugar or iron and
I chose a sugar scrub from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this is the French lavender and
honey body scrub I have not used this at
all yet I'm working on a different scrub
in my shower and I just didn't want to
have too many open at once so once I
finished that up I will move on to this
but these don't tend to take too long so
as long as I continue to try to stay
vigilant I'll be fine the next category
was a wool or copper and I chose the Too
Faced peanut butter and jelly palette I
want a hip hand on the color peanut
brittle it's like a coppery shade that's
my inspiration I did have this in a
project at the beginning of the year I
didn't do the best on it but I did get
some more use out of it so I just need
to give this a little bit more love I am
going to be also putting this with my
pan that palette one month and I think
that's how I will hopefully hit pan on
that shape my next product is a single
shadow from Coastal Scents in bronze
peach this is for bronze / pottery I
honestly haven't been using this but my
goal in general is to hit pan on all of
the products in my Z palette so it's on
the list it just hasn't quite made it
yet I'm still working on it and I do
think I'll hit pan on it that's my goal
not to finish it up just to hit pan and
I do think I'll be able to do that
the next category was pottery or willow
and I chose a baked product from laura
geller because it's baked on a terra
cotta plate and I want to finish
highlighter a hundred percent like
finish it up this is a mini but it's so
hard to finish up something like this I
already have quite a bit of pan
and I have been using this quite a bit I
definitely think I can finish it up by
the end of the year I just want to keep
making progress on it I should have
pictures of everything so whatever I do
have pictures I will be showing up on
the screen throughout this video the
next category was tin / aluminum and I
went with this big sexy hair root pump
this is a volumizing root spray and I
just used this and spray it on my hand
and then put it in I don't spray it into
my hair because it tends to just deposit
too much product in one place I'm like
here on it I probably could use it two
more times and be done so by the next
update for sure this will be done which
will be so exciting this is so much
product so value for money it's good but
it's not my favorite product ever the
next item is steel and there's a whole
long story about how I got to this
product for that category
check out the intro if you don't know
but this is the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana perfume I scratched off some of
the white here so I could actually see
there's like something in my eye
scratched off the white on the side here
so I could actually see where the
perfume is and I'm doing so great this
isn't another project pan that I'm
currently doing and so that's been
helping I am all the way down to here so
I'm like halfway done with this and
we're not even halfway through the year
I definitely know I will be finished
with this and I'm really happy about
that
the more you use it the more I don't
hate it but it will be so good to get
this out of my collection next for silk
I picked me Moroccan oil hair treatment
this makes my hair feel nice and soft
and silky that's why I chose it I had a
line on here originally that's not
really where I started but I am almost
done with this I've been using it a lot
more lately the smell this is amazing
the way it feels in the hair is so nice
and I do have a backup of this so I'm
really happy to be moving through this
so that I can open up the new one I
found out that what was in my eye was an
eyelash which then fell on my cheek but
we've since removed it moving on to the
next category next is lace and I chose
The Rocketeer blush because it has lace
on the packaging I have learned away the
design and I'm starting to see little
dots I feel like of where the end of the
product is so I'm really really
happy about that this is really nice
blush I'm wearing it today I really do
like this and suggest it for people who
you know just want something that's
everyday it's not matte but it's not
overly shimmery it's a great blush it
smells really nice too I have really
been enjoying using this next for ivory
I have a single shadow here from Star
luxe this is in the color pearl and this
is just a really nice white eyeshadow I
was using this last year as a face
highlight and I'm gonna start either
doing that or using it on the lid I have
hit pan on the two lighter shades and my
Z palette so I might just start working
on this and setting my whole lid with it
it's a little bit shimmery but it's kind
of a satin shimmer so I feel like it'll
be okay to put all over the lid we'll
see I'm gonna try it out I'll be really
happy to finish this product is because
it'll be a whole eyes shadow that I get
out instead of just hitting pan but
speaking of hitting pan this is the
Urban Decay eyeshadow in tonic this is
for the category crystal I love this I
hope you guys can see I will have a
picture but I have hit pan on this I
love this shadow so much
I have to dupe sub it now but this is
still my favorite one I feel like it's
just beautiful it gives you such an
ethereal look you can just put this all
over the lid just you know really fast
and I think it just gives you this cool
girl 90s look without trying too hard
really like it but if you want dupes
makeup geeks black light it's very
similar to this and way cheaper and then
look see has one called duper star which
is also I mean the exact same shade
we're almost at the end here next is wax
and I chose a lip balm from nooks this
is their Reve demel lip balm and it's
made with beeswax I am pretty far in
this I use this almost every night when
I go to bed it smells great it feels
great this was one of the products in my
favorite lip product video I'll leave it
link down below if you want to check it
out
this has so much product in it and it's
gonna take me probably all year to
finish it up even if I'm using this
every single night so any progress on
this that I can see it will be amazing
and I will be really really happy if I
could finish this up last for the
category shell I picked 2 of my pocket
backs from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works these are
both in beach scents which is where the
shell inspiration came from this one is
coastal surf and Sun I have not used
this at all and then this one is pacific
cool breeze I've used this once or twice
so there's a little
but a progress I marked it here these
will take a bit of time I don't love
using hand sanitizer I rather wash my
hands and I don't use this hand
sanitizer when I actually do use hand
sanitizer on set so I'm working on them
it'll take a while but I do think I can
finish them by the end of the year that
is my update I hope you enjoyed this
video I feel really happy with where I'm
at so far I've completely hit my goal on
three items out of 17 I know that
doesn't seem like a lot but I feel like
I picked bigger items in this one so I
feel good about that I have a few things
that are almost there and I definitely
think I'm still on track for the year
that's everything guys I will see you in
my next video thank you so much for
watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
