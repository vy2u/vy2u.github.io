Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be an update in my finish 17
in 2017 it's a project pan flop that I'm
doing with other ladies I will leave
them linked all down below clear from
the crimson feathers started this and
this all has to do around textures if
you haven't seen my intro in my first
update I'll leave them linked as well so
you can kind of get caught up so let's
just get enjoyed it's a lot of products
to show so I just want to like move
through it as fast as possible I have
some good progress so that is exciting
number one was paper and for that I
chose to touch a blotting papers I
finished these up last time I only had a
few left so it was just kind of like a
give me product but I'm happy that
they're done I've since bought blotting
papers from CVS they're basically like
the clean and clear equivalent and I
really do enjoy using those to soak up
oils throughout the day and I don't feel
like I have to powder and add more
product instead I can just take away the
oil that is there I'm into blotting
powders now so that kind of started that
love I'm happy to use them up next was
cotton and I was inspired by that to
pick sheet now so I wanted to use up all
the sheet masks in my collection slash
any masks in package like this so far
and have used up three these are the
Tony moly my little eye patches
these were okay and then I had two here
this one is the snail jelly mask from
scooter I think this is an okay mask I
don't know I don't really love sheet
masks that's just a personal preference
to me so I feel like I'm not a good
judge personally I don't feel like I get
the same results as a mess that I put on
my face for like 15 minutes that I
actually put on not in a sheet mask form
so yeah and this is the talika one again
the ones that are like gooey are more my
favorite than an actual cotton one but I
just prefer like masks that are in a jar
or two or something anyway I still have
about seven to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so 7
more things to go for what I'm
considering in this category this down
from the 19 I had originally but I also
feel like I added a few new ones in so
hopefully I can work on getting through
these I have been into masks again like
the ones in the pot recently and so
hopefully I can just try to use that to
work through these next was leather and
I chose the Laura Mercier artist palette
from the packaging my goal is just to
hit pan and one of the
I had already hit pan in fresco and
vanilla nuts before I started this
challenge so I'm hoping to hit pan and
something new I'm thinking about plum
smoke I just haven't been into that
color yet I'm probably going to have
this in a pan that palette one month one
pallet thing that'll probably be how I
use this I still have a lot of time like
half a year to use this so I'm not
worried about it but I should probably
start on it soon no progress yet next is
another item that I already had used up
this one is a candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works in the scent sundress and this was
for fruit slash flowers it's done
nothing special would never repurchase
it not something I miss I'm just glad
it's gone for wood I chose the tart
powder foundation because it has like a
bamboo top I am finally getting dark
enough I believe to actually use this
product so I will be starting this very
soon I have about half the container
left so hopefully I can work through
this by the end of the year if not I'm
probably just going to pass it on I just
having a really long time so hopefully
by next update I'll have some good
progress on this next for sugar slash
iron I have the French lavender honey
body scrub from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I'm
currently trying to finish up the
delicious body scrub and coconut and
once I finished that up I will move on
to this I just didn't want to have that
one open and then put it away and then
move on to this and then come back to
that I'd rather just finish that one up
so I will definitely be able to get
through this by the end of the year I
just need to actually be more consistent
about using body scrubs I was thinking
about maybe bringing back my project use
it up where I pick like about five
products or so every month and just like
really want to work on them let me know
if you guys would be interested in that
I think that would just help me with
some items that make them a little more
lazy about just give me that extra boost
to use them up and basically it's any
items that aren't makeup related that I
want help using up in my collection that
I don't use on a daily basis by myself
but anyway if you think that's a good
idea and you'd like to see that let me
know I'm kind of I don't know I'm
thinking about it I don't know if I want
or not next for wood or copper I chose
the peanut butter and jelly palette from
Too Faced and I want to hit pan on the
color peanut brittle I haven't used this
one in a while it's really pretty coulda
used it today on my lower lash line but
again this shade is just beautiful I
just you know either work on it or
hopefully during fall maybe I can do
something with that it's pretty I'd be
really happy to because it'd be the
first time hitting pan in that palette
and I've used it a lot so I'd love to
see some good pan on it another
eyeshadow this one is for bronze /
pottery and it's part of my Z palette
that I'm panning for the year this is
the color bronze peach really pretty can
use it as a transition shade today it
looks more pink a few lakes in super
peachy but really pretty I just haven't
been using this as much I've been just
you know explore in my collection
working on different things and as much
as I want to like hit pan on things this
year I also want to just feel excited
about my collection so I'm trying to
find a good mix of that now this is an
item I'm super happy about this is the
laura geller baked highlighter in french
vanilla i am so close i know it's hard
to see it looks like i'm basically
finished but i just have a tiny bit on
the outer ring and i will be done with
this you guys know this is one of my
favorite highlighters i think it's
beautiful
i highly suggest it looks so good if you
want just more of a natural highlight a
little bit more of like that inner glow
look this is beautiful and that one was
for pottery because it's based on like a
terra cotta plate next i have an item
that's newly finished this is the bits
of the hair root pump and this was for
aluminum ya can flash aluminum just
cause it's like in a metal container
this took forever to use up I don't have
very thick hair so it's like hard for me
to like spray it into my roots I just
used this as a mousse essentially and
then put it into my hair so if you're
looking for something that's going to
last you a really long time this is
definitely it I would not repurchase
this it was okay
I didn't hate it I just hated that I had
it too long it was like I'm just right
for a new product since I didn't love it
type of thing so happy to have this done
next forest feel I have my perfume from
Elizabeth and James this is Nirvana
white and if you watched my project 10
pan roulette finale you guys know that
I'm basically done with it I'm really
happy I put this in that project just to
make sure I worked on it and
got it done a little bit earlier I was
here on my last update from that project
and I cannot see any more product in
here anymore I scratched off the side so
I could like see inside the bottle and
when I spray it it's like not full
sprays so I'm going to be continuing to
try to like dribble out as much as I can
but since it's basically done really
happy about that glad to move this out
it smells good I get compliments just
about my personal favorite scent and
it's not something that I would want in
my collection all the time next for silk
I have the Moroccan oil treatment I love
this and I probably have seriously two
more uses less the pump doesn't work
anymore I have to take off the pump and
just pour it into my hand so it's very
very close I'm kind of sad I can you
know show you an empty bottle this
update but it will for sure be done the
next time next for lace I have the
benefit rockateur blush and my goal is
just to hit pan on wrist
I can already start seeing the little
lines I just need to start using this as
an everyday blush and now that my
project 10 pan roulette is over I feel
like I can make some good progress I'm
not worried about this I definitely
think I'll hit pan soon next for ivory
is a white shadow I use this as a
highlighter this is from star Lux in the
color pearl not much less it's hard to
see with the light I'm going to probably
repress this and I assume that I can
finish this up entirely which the
awesome this is something I hit my goal
on last time this is for Crystal and
it's the Urban Decay eye shadow and
tonic my goal is just hit pan and I did
do that love this shadow it's like one
of those purpley blue duochrome
I love it for wax I had a lip balm this
is the nukes reeves demel lip balm and I
absolutely love this I think it's great
I definitely have some more progress on
it you will see the difference in the
progress pictures that I show I'm using
this every night I'm doing my best to
just you know work through it I still
can't believe that this only has a 6
month shelf life because it's just so
much product like I feel like they could
put half the product in charge you a
little bit less money and you can work
through it faster and actually in that
time frame still smells great and I'm
going to use it as long as it doesn't go
bad but I feel like that would be a
smarter thing to do and last for shells
I picked some antibac that were like
beach scented this is the Pacific cool
breeze and
do you have a little bit of progress on
this one so just going to hopefully
continue that and then this is the
coastal surf and Sun still haven't used
it this one I like the scent of better
it's one of my favorite scents from Bath
and Body Works so I'm kind of holding on
to this one so I can have some
motivation at the end of the project to
actually get through this and that is
everything I know this was a really big
update thanks so much for sticking
through it with me I'm excited to move
out some of these products and just kind
of hit my goals on them I really need to
step it up though we're almost halfway
through the year and I have a couple big
ones ahead of me a lot of the shadows I
feel like are the ones that I actually
want to hit the goal but I need to start
working on that's everything guys thank
you so so much for watching and I will
see you in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
