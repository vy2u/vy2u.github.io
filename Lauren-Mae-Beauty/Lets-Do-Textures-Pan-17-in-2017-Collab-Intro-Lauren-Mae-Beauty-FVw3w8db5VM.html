Lauren this is going to be a intro to a
new project pan this one is going to
last all year long and it's finished 17
up in 2017 the difference with this one
is that it's all based off of textures
and I believe the gifts you're given
like your first or your years of
marriage I think that's what they are
but either way that is kind of the
inspiration and theme for this project I
was asked to be a part of this club by
Claire or crimson feather she will
obviously be linked down below as well
as the other women in this collab we
have LS we have Lorraine and we have
Veronica shares so definitely go check
those people out to say hi to them if
you're into project pans we will be
posting our updates throughout the year
so definitely tune in to see how we use
these products up but let's just get
into it it is a lot of products I'm
probably gonna be digging into my like
can hear a song that's just like a 10 I
guess of all my products so forgive me
but the first one is paper and I decided
to pick these Tasha blotting papers now
this is a total gimme product and I hate
that it's the first one because it makes
me look like such a baby but this only
has a couple in there but I want to
finish this up
I don't normally blot at all I don't
know why I'm super oily so I should I
just don't have blotting papers around
with me so I want to just finish those
up and get them out I've had those in my
collection since like when I got epsy I
think a long long time like way before
we moved here so that's crazy
next is cotton and I didn't quite
mention in the intro but we were
basically just supposed to be inspired
in some way by those textures so it
doesn't have to be like exactly it's
just as a remind you of con doesn't feel
like cotton is it made of cotton
whatever however you can kind of justify
and make it work in those categories so
for cotton I decided that I want to use
up all of my sheet masks now not all of
these are cotton masks but I feel like
traditionally they are and I do have a
few of those I just want to use up these
sheet masks because I do not like them I
just don't personally enjoy sheet masks
but I do want to try to work through
these this year
if I can maybe through exposure-therapy
enjoy them so I have one that is a white
rose mass this one's from
talika this is one from flora pea I
don't really I don't know this brand at
all I have a little Tony moly I masks I
have a ton or just a ton meaning for of
the snail jelly mask from skin erm and
then I have an S key to mask so that's
my cotton item although it's not really
common the next item is leather and I
decided to pick out my leather kind of
cased laura mercier artist palette I
already have pan in a couple of the
shadows in here and my goal this year is
just to hit pan on at least one more
shade in here I haven't decided the
shade it's between right now plum smoke
and African violet I just think those
are really pretty colors I was using
plum smoke a ton last year and then
African violet is just a really really
pretty purple color so I just want to
see pan and at least one more shadow
this year on that the next category is
fruit or flowers and I chose a candle
from Bath and Body Works this is
sundress and I've had this candle for
forever I used to buy so many bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks candles and I just don't go
through them and I don't anymore
but I still have a back stock so this is
one I've had for so long I just want to
burn through it it smells really nice
and clean and definitely floral I'm
thinking this will be a perfect candle
to burn in the springtime and I think
this project will just be the perfect
push for me to actually burn this I
bought this at like the height of my
like bath and Bodyworks craze so I feel
like a lot of the times I was picking up
sets just to pick them up and not just
sense that I was like in love with
that's why this one's just been left
behind I know I'm gonna need a push to
actually get through this send the next
texture is wood and I am bringing back
the Tarte full-coverage Amazonian powder
foundation whatever this is called I
have this in a project before and this
is just G dark for my skin so it's hard
to use up but I am prepared and
determined to use this up during summer
this year and I think I only have about
half of it left so I think I can do it
I'm really really helping to get this
out this year guys the next textures you
can either choose sugar or iron and I
chose sugar and this is a bath and
Bodyworks I swear everything I'm talking
about in these videos I'm telling today
is the body works it's like crazy this
the French lavender and honey body scrub
and it's a sugar scrub I love this scent
this is one of my favorite scents from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works oh I have a cap on it
I can't smell it it's just a really nice
scent I've loved it since they like
premiered it or whatever it just smells
so good so I will enjoy using this up
the next item has to be somehow inspired
by wool or copper and I chose to pick an
item from the peanut butter and jelly
palette and go with copper so my goal is
to hit pan on the shape peanut brittle
which is a warm orange coppery type of
color I actually already have this in a
project pan that's just like a seasonal
one so I'm hoping that through that
project I can get this one done for the
year if that makes sense I do really
like that shade it's really pretty but I
find four colors in that tone I like to
go matte and put them in my crease and
not usually shimmery so I'm excited to
kind of work with that and see how I
like it
the next one is bronze or pottery and I
chose another eyeshadow and the color I
chose is from my Z palette this is
bronze peach from Coastal Scents it's a
matte shade and it's so pretty I think
this will be so nice as a transition
color and I just want to hit pan on this
as well so I will be filming my 2017 pan
that palette intro after this so that
will also be a part of pan that palette
so it'll be like two birds one stone
does that make sense for that I think it
does
number nine is pottery or willow and I
chose to kind of be inspired by pottery
and I chose a baked product because
they're baked on like terracotta basis
usually hopefully that makes sense for
my inspiration here and this is the
laura geller baked highlighter in french
vanilla I absolutely love this I already
hit pan if you can see there so I really
just want to finish this up this year I
definitely think it's possible this is
one of my favorite highlights it's just
subtle it doesn't give you that metallic
look I really enjoy it it'll be nice to
get through a highlighter I've never
done that the next item is tin or
aluminum and I chose a hair product in
like a
can I don't know if this is tin or
aluminum but it's gonna work that's what
inspired me for this this is the big
sexy hair root pump and it's a
volumizing spray moves I've had this for
forever and pretty sure I've had this
since I moved to California so
definitely over two years I just don't
enjoy this product and you're supposed
to like spray it directly into your
roots but I don't have enough hair for
that I have very thin hair and it just
Gunks out my roots too much so I put
this in my hand and use it almost like a
mousse I only have probably about this
much left but I just choose to use other
products over this so I'm hoping that
this project will be what it takes to
get through this now this next one is
kind of crazy it's steel and I was gonna
choose my perfume in Bulgari z' omnia
coral that's one of my favorite perfumes
but I don't have a lot left of it and I
figured I'm going to naturally go
through that product so I don't want to
put it in a project pan I'd rather work
actually work on something that I
wouldn't have used otherwise if that
makes sense
anyway the steel part of that kind of
the packaging on that looked like steel
ish I think that's what I was going for
I made this list before I even went on
vacation for holiday so I don't know
where my brain was on that but I decided
to switch it out with just a different
perfume so that's how we got to this
this is Elizabeth and James Nirvana
white and I basically have a full bottle
of this I haven't really used it much I
talked about how I don't like this
perfume but there's a part of me that
does like it it's just I like so many
other things so much more than this in
my collection that I don't want to use
this I want to use those things I just
want to use this up this year it's
something that I definitely bought into
the hype the packaging is gorgeous don't
get me wrong I love how sleek it is I
love the white in the gold
whoo I need to wrap it on the ground but
it needs to go I just want I really want
to slow down my perfume collection to
just like loves just things that I would
like kill someone to smell like you know
you know the next one is silk or linen
and I chose another hair product this is
the Moroccan oil Moroccan oil treatment
and this
makes my hair feel so smooth like silk I
believe that Claire like made this an
example and the message she sent me like
a hair product can make your hair feel
like silk I was like yes perfect thank
you so that's why I picked this I don't
have like anything left of this this is
like it seriously at the very bottom but
you need so little of this product and I
have another backup of this like
completely unopened so my goal is just
to like get through this and start
working on the other one because I've
had this open bottle since when we moved
here too so definitely need to work
through this the next item is inspired
by lace and this is the rockatuer blush
from benefit and I chose this because
there is lace on the packaging basically
when I went and picked these items out
before Christmas and everything I was
like oh I think this is what I want for
lace it's perfect you know so I hadn't
used it it still had the rock symbol on
it and I've been using this ever since I
chose this for this project before this
project started and I've really been
enjoying it so I just want to hit pan on
this it's really easy to use blush and
I'm really happy that I even chose it
for this project it happened using it as
much as I have I was or have been using
it because I bought this because height
because it came out everyone was raving
about it and I never used it like I
don't know why cuz it's such a beautiful
color but yeah this is something I want
to hit pan on anyway it's lots of
rambling I feel like I'm like out of it
today like I wanted to film but my
goodness I don't know what's going on
with like my brain I just want to hit
pan on this this year is what I'm trying
to say I love the smell of this blush -
it smells so good we only have about 4
more products left so number 14 is ivory
and I chose to pick an ivory colored
eyeshadow this is what I want to use up
all the way this year I've already hit
pan on it in last year's project and
this is a star looks eyes shadow in the
color pearl as you can see there's pan
on it this is a really pretty shade it's
so pigmented I love that it shows up so
nicely on my skin I feel like when light
colors aren't pigmented enough they
don't show up on my skin because I'm
already fair and this one looks so good
on the lid but it's not too metallic
like it doesn't look like liquid metal
it just gives a brightness I really like
it
the next one is crystal
and I was inspired by a duochrome shadow
this is one of my favorites is this
tonic from Urban Decay and I'd like to
hit pan on it I already have a good dip
going in this it's one of my favorite
shadows just ever it's so pretty I just
love it
highly suggested there is a makeup geek
one I think in Phantom that's really
similar if you don't want to pay the
price for this one but yeah I want to
hit pan on this and just enjoy this
shadow it's so pretty I love duo chromes
and fun colors you guys know that next
is wax and you would think why don't you
use a candle because I got somethin else
girl and that is the nukes lip balm this
is the reve reve de Mel I don't know if
that's how you say it but this is made
with beeswax and I really love this it
smells so good it smells kind of like
honey and orange which is really weird
because I don't like honey but just
smells like citrusy and great it feels
so good on the lips I love putting this
on at night and just you know
conditioning my lips getting them back
to feeling good so that way I can have
nice lips in the morning I would like to
finish this up I think this is gonna
this one's gonna take like all year I
feel like you don't need much of this
product so if I could finish this up
this year I think that'd be good because
if I don't know how long it's good for
let's see 6 months is the shelf life on
that which if I finish it by the end of
you know 2017 will definitely be over
that so it definitely want to get this
out but enjoy it like do you hear me I'm
stumbling over everything I really hope
I can edit it out so you don't know but
if you were here you would be like are
you sure you film 300 videos
next is shells and I was inspired by
shells and the beach to pick these to
bath and Bodyworks auntie backs pocket
backs whatever you want to call them I
decided I want to go through two of them
I went on a buying spree with these
actually you don't even have to go on a
buying spree with these because you buy
them five at a time usually over the you
you or you used to because it'd be five
if you pick out five they're dollar each
umm anyway so I want to go through
coastal surf and Sun and I love this end
it's one of my favorite bath and
Bodyworks scents ever it smells so good
mmm I'll enjoy that one and then the
other one is pacific cool breeze so it
should hopefully be easy to go through
I find though I can't use this onset
because they're just a little too much
for me to be like putting my hands in
people's faces and if they don't like
the scent then you know that sucks for
them so I don't use them on set I just
use them in like my personal life so
hopefully can get through those okay I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
super excited to do this project thank
you so much to Clara for inviting me and
coming up with this I think it's so fun
that we've just been like so creative
you know when we started off with
project 10 pans and then we went to you
know project panel ads and now we're
going to like things inspired by sweets
and different things I think it's just
so fun some of us are going back with 10
pans which are totally good I don't know
it's cool to see how it's evolving I
guess is what I'm saying I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day and that I
wasn't to psycho in this video and I
will see you in my next one hey guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
