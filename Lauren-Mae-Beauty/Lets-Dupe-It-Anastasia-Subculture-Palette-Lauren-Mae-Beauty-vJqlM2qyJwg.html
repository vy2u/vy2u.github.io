Lawrence thank you so much for watching
today is going to be a less stupid on
the subculture palate I did end up
picking up the subculture palette this
is not a review by any means this is
just a less stupid I do these on a bunch
of other palettes this isn't my first
one if you guys want to check out the
playlist I'll leave a link down below
but in this series I just take a palette
usually I don't have it so I did have
the luxury of actually being able to
swap them next to each other but usually
I will look up swatches look at pictures
and then with my own collection I go
through my single shadows and I pick
colors that I think would be very
similar or if I don't have something
very similar be within the spirit as a
palette so this is my dupe for it and
then hold them up next to each other so
you guys can see and I think it is
pretty pretty well not all of these are
going to be exact like I said even
though I have to tell it with me I
really like to use single shadows to do
things because you can arrange them in
the same order as the palette and be
inspired in the same way you would be
with the original plus if you don't want
all of these and you just really like
this metallic shade you could just get
that or you could just get the orange
shade or whatever you are really liking
from the palette so I hope this is
helpful in any way if you love your
subculture palette that's awesome if you
hate the subculture palette here are
some options potentially for you like I
said I don't have any thoughts yet on
this palette I haven't used it enough
and I don't really want to talk about it
until I feel like I've used it enough
and can really have some solid solid
opinions on it so I'm going to be going
through this a little bit differently I
do have my bonus shades I also do have a
demo at the end of this video I will
leave timestamps down below so instead
of showing you guys all of these shades
and then going into my bonus shadows I'm
going to be showing you these shades
along with the bonus shadows I have for
each shade as we go along down through
the palette I think it'll just be easier
and also I did want to swatch some
things for you that were in palettes
that I felt like we're really similar
this hell it was difficult and also not
difficult for me to do I love these like
orange yellow type of shades so I feel
like I had some things like that in my
collection I also love like the peaches
and stuff mostly when it came to the
greens and blues those are the hardest
for me so this one immediately you can
tell is way different than the one in
the palette also these green
and blues are just a little bit off
they're not exact so just from what I've
had in my collection I couldn't quite
dupe them exactly but you will see that
in the swatches and I'll go through that
as we talk about it we're just going to
start from the beginning so the first
shade in the palette is the color cube
and this is a duochrome shade so it
looks white in the palette but it
actually turns into a really pretty pink
now this is a swatch with my finger and
it doesn't show up very well I find that
whenever I try to swatch this shade it
just gets hard pan really fast so that
kind of sucks I can't I can kind of dig
in a little bit but it's really hard to
get pigment out of the actual pan so
that is a swatch of it there now for my
color I chose this one for makeup geek
this is the color prism and you cannot
get these pressed I happen to have a
pressed version but you can get these in
a loose pigment and this is also a dual
crochets it has a shift of pink peach
and kind of gold so it's not the same
exact undertone as the pink but for the
sake of my individual shadow pans I did
think that it worked nicely it gave a
similar vibe and I do like it I used it
in my look today on my inner corner and
then I do have some bone shades so one
of them comes from an honest raffia
palette called the moon child palette
now a lot of people have called this out
but the colored pink heart in this
duochrome palette is very very similar
to cube as well it is watch on the
bottom now it does have a bit more of
that white base it doesn't just show up
straight pink it also does have a bit of
glitter in it so keep that in mind but
if you already have the moon child
palette you can definitely use the pink
heart shade as a very similar color to
cube and then last for a bonus shade I
do have the alchemists palette this is
very similar to the moon child palette
and the color pink opal in here is going
to be again very very similar it also
has more of a white base but it does
flash pink it has no glitter in it as
well just to let you guys know so these
would be my similar shades to the color
cube in the subculture palette
next in a palette is the shade dawn and
this is a matte kind of peachy color
it's great for the transition especially
if you have a fair to medium skin tone
my number one dupe or the one I have in
my palette is the color sorbet by
looksie I will leave my entire brand
review on look-see down below if you
want to check that out if you haven't
heard of them before but this one is
very very similar so that is dawn on my
hand it's kind of this really
interesting mix of peach and brown and
although it seems like a shade you
wouldn't think would be hard to do it
kind of is hard to do so below it is the
shade sorbet and it is a bit more peachy
it doesn't have as much brown in it but
it's very similar I have three bonus
shades for this one so it's kind of a
lot but it was kinda hard to pick
something that was exact so I thought I
would just kind of do anything that was
really similar so depending on what you
gravitate to more you would have an
option in comparison so the first one I
want to talk about is Anasazi is orange
soda this is nothing new to my channel
because I love this shade and this just
feels so good this is it here on the
bottom again it is very very similar
nothing exact but I mean so so similar
next I have a color from makeup geek
this is the color creme brulee and this
is going to be the brownest out of
everything that's it there and you can
definitely go lighter with it to get
more of a similar shade but I didn't
want to bring this up and if you have a
bit of a darker complexion this might
work a little bit better as a transition
shade for you and the last one that I
have here is from Coastal Scents this is
a shade pumpkin pie this is one of my
favorites and this is definitely brown
as well but it's kind of like a yellow
brown I wouldn't say it's like an orange
and that is there so those are my kind
of dupe / similar shades to the color
dawn in the palette
next we have the shape destiny in the
palette if they met olive green and
something I was realizing as I was
trying to dupe these out is that
although these colors may look light in
the pan they are so pigmented that when
you swatch them they show up darker than
you'd expect so some of my colors in the
palette may seem like they're darker but
really they're not when you swatch them
out and in actually use for destiny the
closest color that I have in my
collection is the color olive wood by
Coastal Scents this is what it looks
like
there it is swatch next to it this one
definitely is a little bit more yellow
where this is a little bit more cool
challenge but they are very very similar
and for me I don't have a lot of colors
like this because I tend to not really
go towards like I don't gravitate to a
lot of colors like this so if you just
want to kind of try out in army green
and see what it's like I think this
would be a nice one and then the other
color I just wanted to mention it's not
that similar but this is a color Olive
again by Coastal Scents and this is
going to be a bit lighter a bit brighter
and definitely more like green than the
other two and that's it swatch there so
those are my kind of like dupes
flashdisk comparisons of the color
destiny in the palette
next Andrew palette we have the color
adorned which is absolutely beautiful I
think this is such a pretty shade I can
see it pairing with so many of the
colors and it's just a nice metallic I
know I've heard a lot of people say this
is really like chunky but I find this to
be super pigmented and it's great so
that is it they're my number 1 closest
dupe i feel like this is so spot-on is
the color board shorts from colour-pop
in so many ways this is so very similar
it's just as pigmented it feels it's
creamy I just I know they look almost
spot-on to me so I definitely suggest
this these are five dollars but for a
long time you've been four dollars on
the site so if you really just want to
bat shade that's the one you're drawn to
this is a great just single shadow form
of it and now we'll move into my bonus
shades for adorn this is the color M II
23 I will leave the actual color on the
screen but this is from Coastal Scents
and this is also very similar and it's
even cheaper than color pop if you can
believe it I just personally like the
color pop formula better than this
specific one it's super pigmented by a
little bit powdery so that's just
something to keep in mind but this
shadow only costs two dollars so it's
still amazing and that's it there on the
bottom
and then one that I just thought was
interesting it's not as similar as the
other ones this is definitely more cool
toned is the color grandstand for makeup
geek if you are wanting something more
cool and not so warm I just thought this
would be a nice one to kind of compare
it to if anything up next to these
colors this looks very almost pink but
that is it there it definitely has the
high shine finish though yeah and I just
kind of want to throw it in there so you
guys could see what it looks like
against it and I think this would still
be a really pretty color in the palette
next in the palette we have the shade
all-stars this is a burgundy like blood
wine color really pretty and that's it
there these are just insanely pigmented
it's crazy you just cannot beat the way
that these maps watch out for my number
one dupe I picked the color cherry cola
from makeup geek this is another matte
as well and I am building this swatch up
so you guys can really see that if you
built this color up it's very very
similar it's not nearly as pigmented as
the Honest John vo one but it's not
going to be as soft either and probably
not give you as much fallout so those
are the two next to each other very very
similar I'm happy with this do and then
one I kind of just wanted to throw in
there something that I think is really
interesting this is definitely going to
give you a brighter look but this is
color pops going steady it's also matte
and I just love this color
sometimes colors like this all-star are
so pretty but they don't really
translate on the lid as like color they
just kind of add a deepness so I thought
I would just show you what this one
would look like next to it and I don't
know I think personally if I was to
recreate this palette or just kind of
add my own spin on it this is something
I think would be really pretty in there
so that is going steady from colour-pop
we're getting close to finishing the top
room here guys next we have the color
mercury this is a taupe like classic
taupe color it's matte and again it
looks lighter in the pan but it is a
dark dark color my hand is a little bit
wet over here that's why it looks a
little different but that's it there
it's definitely very cool toned my
number one dupe for this would be from
look see again this is totally devoted
now I have a feeling that this was
actually part of a limited edition
collection so this is basically for
people who might already have this
shadow that's it's there it's not quite
as cool toned and gray as the mercury
color but it is very very similar and
personally I kind of like this one a
little bit better but if you don't have
that I do have one from Coastal Scents
that's also very similar and this is the
color timeless so this one feels really
soft it's a very good one from Coastal
Scents I'm going to build that swatch up
for you guys a little bit and there it
is on the bottom so you're definitely
getting a cooler shadow but I just I
like this one a little bit better for
whatever reason I just think it like
goes on with more pigmentation a little
bit faster and I do like the tone of it
but those are some swatches and
comparisons for the color mercury
and lastly the top row we have the color
axis this is a matte blue it's very very
deep though and to be honest with you I
don't have anything like this I mean it
is it looks like velvet on the singer
it's insane the way this goes on look at
that that's crazy it's crazy I don't
have anything like this in my collection
so I kind of just had to go with what I
had and kind of what I was feeling and
going with the spirit of the palette and
all that goodness I chose something with
a different finish and something that's
not quite as dark mostly because they
didn't have anything as dark as this
this is definitely a unique shade in
this palette I don't know how many other
shades are going to be like this out
there I have seen one other dupe video
kind of in my recommended I have not
watched it yet but I will leave it link
down below so if you guys want to try
that video out as well and you haven't
seen it to maybe get some different
options for dupes you have that at your
disposal
anyway the color I chose is the color
from Dini from makeup geek this is one
of the foiled shadows and this is not
something that I normally use but I just
thought this would be kind of a cool
addition to the palette or substitution
or if you have this maybe try to use it
in a similar way but that is it there so
it's definitely different
I mean I'm not trying act this is a dupe
for it it's not but this is the color
that I put in my palette that I made at
home for the subculture palettes and I
didn't want to throw in a bonus shoutout
still four axis this is the color
Farallones I don't know I think it's
French though so the two L's probably
makes a different sounds but I don't
know off the top of my head and this is
from the brand is team and this is a
matte so if you're looking for a match
this one's really pretty but this is
definitely a brighter blue and it's not
as dark it's just more blue the other
one has a lot of green in it but I think
if you're looking for something similar
on its own chemical are kind of similar
and I do think that was very pigmented
too just showed off the bat it's just I
mean nothing compares
moving on to the second row of the
palette we have the shape Roxy this is
one of my favorite colors and the
palette I think it's so so pretty it's a
matte peach color and I think it's so
pretty
obviously I use it in my look today with
my duke color and I'm really happy with
the dupe I have we'll see how it looks
on camera but I think it's very very
Simula this is the color petal peach
from Coastal Scents and this is also a
matte this is also a powdery though - I
mean it matches in a couple of ways more
than one and that's it there oh my gosh
guys up so similar right and I already
love the shadow before so if you're
looking for something like Roxy but you
just can't stand how powder it is or you
don't want to buy the whole palette
petal peach from Coastal Scents is a
very very similar color and finish and
texture and pigmentation in basically
everything it's so similar this is
probably the best soup out of everything
and I don't even have Bona shades for
that one because it's best bought on
now we're moving on to electric this is
the other duochrome shade in the palette
and this one I can get a little bit more
pigmentation off of my finger and the
swatch then I can with the shade cube my
hand was a little bit wet when I just
swatch that so I think it did show up
even a little better than it normally
would if it was just a dry hands I don't
have anything quite like this it is
definitely in the more unique shade it's
light and it has that dual chrome in it
it's like green but a little bit yellow
and then a tiny bit of something almost
orange to it so these groups are not
exact but these are the things that I
had most similar that I felt like kept
in line with the palette and I thought
would work with the other colors in the
palette so this is B color slither from
look see Beauty this is a really nice
shade it's like a limey green and it
does have a bit of a duo chrome to it as
well but it is definitely brighter it's
not like a little accent it's a full-on
color
it's what I'm wearing on my lid today
but I wanted to show that and this is
the color I did add to my palette
because since I didn't have anything
similar I thought I'm going to do the
one that I think would look the best in
this palette I feel I got quite a few
bonus shapes for this because again I
didn't have anything similar I thought I
would just kind of go every which way
and show you guys different options so
next we're going back into the moonchild
palette from Mona Sophia and there is
the color Lucky Clover this one is going
to give you a flash of green it's not a
dead-on dupe again for electric and this
green definitely has a bluish tint to it
compared to electric but it's an option
if you're not going to use the green
duochrome shade all the time this one
might be a good one for the few times
you will use it Kat Von D also has a
similar green in her duochrome College
and that is the color green emerald that
gets washed there it's very very similar
on Australia but I just thought I would
show as you guys can see them all
compared to each other one from lucky
again this is the color line light and
it's similar to another two colors last
we will swatch it so that is lime light
because look exactly the things of you
you have one of those you have them all
and last year I have naked Peaks gesture
this is similar to slither it's going to
give you that high metallic finish this
one's not as yellow-green it's a little
bit darker but
would also show that if you were
wondering comparison why those are what
those look like next to each other and
those are my closest oops and comparison
to the color electric in the palette
the next shade in the palette is fudge
and this is the one and only color that
is being reused you can buy this in a
single form it has also been in other
palettes in the past so you can always
do pit with the color fudge from other
places
I have heard though from swatch
comparisons in different videos that
they are not the exact same so keep that
in mind but you can always use that I do
not have such in a single shadow but the
color little boat is very similar this
is from colour-pop and I thought once I
built this swatch up it was pretty
pretty similar so that's it's there
again not quite as pigmented but
nothing's going to be a signature
disease honestly it's very similar as a
matte finish as well and these are very
good price I really like the color pop
shadows and for my bonus shade I wanted
just to bring up something that I think
would look really good in the palette I
felt like it was the appropriate place
to kind of insert this color and since
the color Cocteau BER fest from Coastal
Scents so pretty this is definitely
going to be more orange and not quite as
deep but I think it would look so good
with those yellow and orange shade so I
thought I would just show this as a
comparison so you guys could see but
those are my dupes and comparisons to
the color fudge in the palette
next we have the color new waves and
this is the orange a yellow in the
palette I feel like honestly when these
two swatch out next to each other
they're not that different I kind of
wish that the yellow ones a little bit
brighter I think it would just add
something a little bit different but I
don't know that's just me that is a new
way there it's definitely orange though
and I think I found a pretty dang good
dupe this is the color pumpkin spice
light from look see beauty it has that
same just yellowy orange color to it I'm
going to build this swatch up again just
so you guys can see how close they
actually are and that's it they're so
similar guys right and this is a single
shadow I'm pretty sure you can still get
this one on the website all of these
shadows will be linked down below if I
can find them just so you guys know and
for your convenience but so similar so
if new wave was like the one thing
selling you on the pallet you can
definitely find a single shadow and that
and the other single shadow that I have
here is chickadee from makeup geek this
is also very very similar I mean that
one is just as similar as a looksie one
it's one of those shades that seems so
unique and then if you like look in your
collection if you like those types of
colors you can find them
next is the color untamed in the palette
it's another map and it's kind of a mix
between the shade destiny and access
took a bluey olive green again I don't
have anything quite similar to this
because these are colors that I really
gravitate you but the color that I did
pick for my palette is the color
Pinehurst from Coastal Scents
this is a matte as well and this just
doesn't swatch out as like all of the it
definitely has more of that Bluegreen to
it it's a little bit brighter but that's
as close as I could do in my single
shadows guys that's as close as I could
do and then for my bonus shadow for in
tamed I just want to show you guys what
Moss it looks like swatched out this is
from the Kat Von D metal matte palette
which came out last holiday in 2016
and I thought this one was pretty
similar let me build it up so you guys
can get a good idea and not just watch
it like a freak and that's what it looks
like there so I feel like it's a little
bit more similar it's not as much blue
to it it's not as deep it's not as dusty
but I thought that I would just show you
guys in case you guys have that palette
at home you can know what it looks like
compared to untamed
the second alive shadow in the palette
is the color edge and this is a mustard
yellow it is really pretty don't get me
wrong I know I kind of said that New
Wave is very similar but that is what
edge looks like I'm going to swatch a
new wave on top of it and that's a new
wave on top because they're out that
similar I don't know this just yellow I
wish was a little bit brighter anyway my
number one deport is from colour-pop and
this is the color paper tiger I feel
like this is very similar I wasn't
expecting it to be that close because I
don't think of this is like a mustard
yellow but that's it there see it's not
it's not quite especially in monitor I
can tell the most but this is more
yellow this one's kind of a mix between
the two if they had a baby it would be
paper tiger but for my bonus shadow I
did want to mention a color from Coastal
Scents that I really do like this is the
color cantaloupe splice I've talked
about this a lot on my channel but this
is definitely a brighter yellow this is
not as mustardy doesn't have that like
grunge undertone but if you mix paper
tiger in this together you'd probably
get something closer to edge but anyway
these are my comparisons and dupes for
the color edge in the palette
we're doing it guys around the last
color here thank goodness the last shade
in the college is the color rowdy and
again this is something I do not have a
dupe or I just don't go for shades this
dark on my eyes so I just don't tend to
like buy single shadows in this color
again insane pigmentation like there's
just nothing that's really going to
swatch out quite like this maybe in that
other Duke but I'll find something that
does but my goodness it would be like
insane for something to be this
pigmented with like barely any pressure
or barely anything is insane and the
only color I could think that was kind
of similar to it that I felt like would
go on this palette is the color
chocolate varied from Coastal Scents now
this is a different finish this is a
shimmer finish and it is not nearly as
dark but it definitely gives off similar
tones I don't think it's an entirely
horrible do it's just definitely not the
same it's just kind of a similar to
similar shadow but if you really want
that matte finish in the darkness this
is not going to work for you but if you
want something similar or just something
inspired by it
this one could work that is one one do
before the color reality of the palette
alright guys that is everything for my
bonus shadows and my dupes I really hope
that this helped you find something
similar if you were looking to dupe this
talent out I know that there are a lot
of mixed reviews going on on this
palette some people love it some people
hate it some people think it's a batch
thing honestly these colors aren't going
to be for everyone and I think something
that I'm just going to note on here is
that it's kind of hard to pair these
colors together there are a mix of warm
tones and cool tones they have oranges
but then they have balloons with your
opposite on the color wheel and it'll
look kind of cool together but if you
mix them they're going to turn gray so I
think that that is something just to
keep in mind whether you're going to do
this palette or you're going to get the
dupes for it just to be mindful of that
and when you're creating your looks you
kind of have to be just a little bit
more thoughtful about how you're going
to mix colors because it definitely can
turn muddy really really fast with some
of these color combinations like even
rowdy and edge would be kind of scary
together like they look so pretty but
when you put them on the eye it can get
a little dicey so even the red and green
like I'm telling you anyway regardless
of your thoughts on the subculture
palette if you do have it I really do
hope that these dupes help you in some
way or another and inspire you to kind
of look throughout your collection and
maybe try using other colors to get the
same inspiration that the subculture
palette gives because honestly even
though some of these shades don't work
for people
there's just something about this color
combination that is inspiring and
exciting so one more thing before we
move on to the demo let me know if you
liked the format of this video better
where I talked about each shade and went
through all my color dupes and
comparisons and then moved on to the
next one or if you like me running
through my initial dupe palette and then
going into bonus shades in no particular
order I would love to know because
whichever one you like better I'll
continue to do and that's everything
let's do the demo now hi guys let's get
into this demo as you right now I'm
going to be using my dupes for the
subculture palette you've already seen
so often is and everything
on this so I'm not going to talk too
much about that I don't know what I work
I'm going to really be doing today so
we're just going to kind of play it by
ear is that the term or phrase I'm not
sure before that I am going to set my
lid and I'm just using this from the cap
on D because it's what I have I mix the
white in the bone shade but I probably
just could use the bone shade so first
off for my transition I'm going to be
using this shade and I'm just going to
be putting that into the crease and
blending it out I think I want to do
something with the like lime green on
the lid I know that's not very similar
to the color
I think it's electric in the palate but
it's what I do it with with what I had
in my collection and I think it's going
to look really pretty so I'm just going
to go for it now that I have that blend
around the eye I'm going to go in with
the new porosity which is petal teach by
Coastal Scents I'm going to be taking it
on this brush and also on a bit of a
smaller blending brush I'm just trying
to kind of deepen up the crease a little
bit keeping this on the outer corner
it's a very similar placement to what I
do just changing up the shade and I'm
not doing a full-on review of the
subculture palette yet because I haven't
used it enough but I will say that these
even in the few experiences that I have
had are a bit easier just to work with
because they aren't insanely pigmented
and they don't have as much fallout as
the anasazi one not that I don't like
that palette I don't really have
opinions quite on it yet but just saying
now that I have that blended out I'm
going to go in with the kind of orange
shades this is pumpkin spice life it's a
super new wave I believe and I'm just
going to be putting that into the brow a
little not all the way up like I
normally do but just kind of right there
and just blending next for the lid I'm
going to be going in with this color
here this is a dupe for fudge and it is
called little boat from colour-pop it is
a part of their summer collection so you
can still get it now have a feeling
it'll just be permanent but if you are
wondering that's I would get it now if
you really want this shade or you could
just use fudge buy honest I'll do that
and the palate or any brown you want
really and I'm just blending out with
this other brush because I put it a
little higher than I anticipated and now
we're going back in with petal peach and
I'm just going to be blending out the
edges of that Brown just making sure
they're nice and blended still now for
the fun part you could definitely just
go in with the kind of brandy shade
adorned or this one is color pops for
short but I'm going to be going in with
the green I just think it will be more
fun why not do a little color look see
shadows they're really nice but I find
that they work best with a flat brush
and a setting spray today I'm going to
be using the kiss Pro touch you can use
any setting spray it's just going to
help bind the product and just make it
look more opaque more metallic on the
lid you guys probably know how to use
setting sprays to foil your eyeshadows
you can also use your finger I'm
probably going to do a little bit of
both honestly so yeah let's just do this
putting that green all over the lid I'm
really liking the way that looks on the
lid so I'm going to go back in with my
sponge color sludge color and I'm going
to just be kind of blending that into
the green so we have a better transition
and I just like to Pat to get those to
fade into each other or not really blend
because we don't want to lose any
pigment all right I really like the way
that looks so let's move on to the
bottom lash line actually I'm going to
kind of I kind of wanted to do this
darker blue um yeah I think that's what
I want to kind of focus on so first off
I'm going to take a little bit of paper
tiger from colour-pop and just kind of
run this on the bottom of the lash line
next I'm going to go into this pine
color from Coastal Scents and I'm going
to put that mostly on the outer half of
my eye and I put down a yellow just as
something tiny to blend it into and that
might seem like a weird color but I
figured that this kind of blue green and
yellow could actually make like a
lighter green or something and I'm just
keeping it on the outer half and then
I'm going to blend out with no product I
feel like this might have been a fatal
mistake color wise just you know not
really
just loving it we'll see I do have a bit
of thought so I'm just going to sweep
that away
I'm just committing to the green and I'm
going in with a more precise brush and
really putting that as close as possible
to the lash line to try to tie this
together a little bit more I'm going to
go into a little bit of the toe in the
side and just kind of deepen up the
outer corner for whatever reason I don't
think I was recording but I did go in on
my inner corner and just put a little
bit of makeup geek prism this is a press
pigment but they do sell it in a regular
loose pigment if you want that color
next I'm going to go into some liners
this is a white liner I'm gonna put it
on my waterline and then this is like a
dark brown I'm going to be putting it in
my tight line I might add a little bit
on the bottom just to ground it a little
bit and then I lose that for mascara for
mascara today I'm going to be going in
with the moms here big Lancome mascara
this is brand new and I have really been
liking this it gives a ton of volume and
I like that I can just kind of do one
coat honestly and it's pretty dang built
up like that's just one coat I think
that's pretty good okay so I did not put
a blush or a highlight around because I
just didn't know how this look was going
to go I am going to be using my Eden
minerals blush in half torn I thought
this would be a nice one it's pretty
neutral but it has some of those peachy
tones which will go with the crease
color I definitely think this lip came
together more with the mascara I feel
like that always happened and then for
highlighter today I'm going to be using
my kids professional halos driven
palette you guys know I've been loving
this and I'm going to kind of mix
between these two shades I like the eye
tennis of the white one but I just love
the middle one so I'm just going to mix
them and then lock for this look I'm
going to be going in with my books and
San Francisco lip pencil or lipstick I
was hoping this one would go nicely I
think it looks okay I feel like in the
monitor it looks more like red and it's
way more Berry in person okay guys that
is everything for this let's do pit I
hope you enjoyed the video if that's
everything thank you so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
