Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be another episode of my
let's do p'tee Rees I'm really excited
because this is a palette that you guys
recommended to dupe and it is the Kylie
royal peach palette so here's a little
sneak preview of the palette let me talk
about a few things what this series is
about if you're new I was inspired to
create this series because I really
wanted to shop my stash and look into my
single shadows and see what I could do
or get really similar to these are not
gonna be a hundred percent dupes like
they look exactly alike I don't even
have the palette because that's the
whole point of this is to like stop
yourself from buying it and instead be
inspired by things you've already bought
and already spent money on and to get
the same inspiration from those products
now what else I don't know I want to
make sure I hit everything just in case
I get some new people because this is
like Kylie I don't have the palette not
exact swatches I did the best I could
based off of pictures I was looking at a
ton of different pictures and different
linings so keep that in mind
finishes aren't necessarily exact either
I'll mention it here again but something
that I think is really exciting about
palettes is the inspiration behind them
and the reason I picked single shadows
is so I can arrange them in a palette to
look exactly like the palette that I'm
trying to do so that way I can get the
same type of inspiration from it and I
like to keep the spirit of the palette
intact so even if finishes aren't right
I feel like you could use these shadows
and get a very similar look to like
what's on the cover of the palette or
any look that you could create with that
palette if you don't want to buy all of
these shadows you can also just pick the
ones that maybe you don't already have
in your collection and boom you have
your own Kylie palette at home so if you
have this palette and you love it that's
awesome if you were wanting this palette
and this is a better deal awesome this
is just a fun way for us to shop our
stash enjoy our products hopefully you
might have some of these at home so
since I don't have the palette I'm going
to go into swatches one by one first
we'll be going like left to right so you
guys can follow along I also have some
bonus shades so these are things that I
felt like we're really similar to things
in the palette maybe not the best match
or I thought these matched a little
better
but I think if you had any of these or
wanted any of these you could get very
similar looks as well I will not be
having a demo portion of this
you guys though and I know you like it
it just didn't work out for me to film
today so I'm really sorry about that but
I will be trying to incorporate down
those as much as I possibly can another
reason I really didn't put a demo in
here is just because this wasn't a
palette that really inspired me I think
this is a beautiful palette but it
wasn't one that ever tempted me so I'm
not a hundred percent inspired by this I
just feel like yeah they're tones I'd
like but I already felt like I had them
and it wasn't something I wanted I feel
like I'm just gonna make the same looks
that I normally would make like
something like this or whatever so that
was another reason I was like since I'm
not like jonesing to do a look with this
that that specifically is this palette
so probably using either you know the
blue the green or the purple I was kind
of like okay passing it enough of that
time stamps are down below my goodness
and you can get to where you want to go
so let's start off with the first shade
in my palette this is the color sorbet
and this is actually from a new brand I
will be doing a beauty brand spotlight
on this brand coming up soon I just want
to use the shadows a little bit more but
this is from the brand look see and this
is the color sorbet this is a matte
color and it's very similar to orange
soda from Anastasia I mean it's a peach
shade it's perfect I really like this
one I feel like this is a really close
comparison to what's in the palette the
next I want to mention is something that
is a little bit different this is a
matte shade and I think the color and
the palette is actually shimmering this
is the best that I could do based off of
pictures and personally I like matte so
this is kind of my own little flare on
the palette like if I was creating it
out of my shadows as well as taking into
account what I would prefer for shadows
that maybe I don't have in single form
this is what I would replace with it
this is dreamboat from colour-pop and
this is a really pretty almost like
purpley shade I know that the one in the
palette probably isn't this purple it's
a little slightly more cool tones than
some of the peachy or shades but I think
it works really nicely with the palette
especially with another purple shade in
it at least with the one I created and I
really like colourpop's formula so I
think it's really beautiful I will have
some bonus shades for that color as well
once we get to those the next 11 palette
was a little bit hard to do I didn't
feel like I had something quite that
peach but the color I decided to end up
going with is petal peach from Coastal
Scents this is a really pretty color
it's actually been in a couple of my
other dupe videos I like this color so
much it
so pretty all over the lid this is in my
everyday palette for my Z palette so
this is something I use quite often and
I really do like this this is also a
matte color the next color is something
that I feel like everyone liked the
palette for or didn't like the palette
for it was definitely a standout shade
in the palette and for the dupe I
decided to go with makeup geeks Neptune
this is a matte cobalt blue shade for a
matte and this bright of a blue I do
think it's pretty good I mean that's
pretty good for this shade I think this
definitely would be better with a primer
and you know applying it more densely
with a flat shader brush if you're gonna
use it but I still think this is a great
shadow I definitely recommend it it's
beautiful it'll definitely give you that
bright royal blue if you're trying to
recreate the look on the outside of the
packaging really inexpensive if this is
like the one shady we're wanting you can
pick this up for $6 on makeup geeks
website we have two more shades on the
top row to go through this is a newer
brand that I mentioning as well this is
from the brand it's C I believe that's
how you pronounce it this is the color
Gold Coast it's a really pretty shimmery
gold the color of this kept changing
when I look at it in different pictures
and different lighting sometimes it
looked more yellow gold sometimes it
looked more almost like greeny gold so I
do have another option if you want
something more like all of the gold but
I think this one's really nice I'm sure
we all have a gold out there if you're
not looking for a single shadow
I mean look in your lorac Pro I feel
like gold and that palette would be very
similar I don't think that the shade on
this one is that special it's probably
something you can easily do pwith your
favorite gold whatever that is but this
is gold coast and the one I felt like
was the most similar out of my
collection and lastly the top row I'd
won with another color from look see and
this is the color maple I believe that
again the finish is different in the
palette I think it's more of like a
shimmer or almost like a satin color
it's not super metallic but definitely
not mad this is a matte color and this
is a red based Brown I guess that's what
we'll call it has a little bit of orange
in it too again I will be using these
shadows more but if you're gonna go and
buy them now or
wanting to just know that these
definitely don't have a buttery texture
they're super pigmented and they blend
out well every time I've used them keep
that in mind or wait for my full review
and tell them all the way done but I
mean it's super pigmented there's I mean
I don't know I'm just using that I'm
trying to work with them but I think
that color wise is really pretty this
works really nice on the lids and I
think it's it's just really pretty I'm
kind of glad I went with more mats
because I prefer mattes on my eyes which
is so weird I I don't think I would have
said that a couple years ago so that's a
look at the first half of the palette
I'll be entering inserts and stuff but
you know since I had them all out I
thought it'd show you on to the second
row of the palette the shadow I decided
to go with this something from Coastal
Scents I have on here and you know three
but I will put whatever the actual name
of this is down below this is one of my
favourite shadows from Coastal Scents
I've loved this for a very long time
it's insanely creamy so pigmented and
beautiful one swipe I mean my goodness
guys so beautiful this was a hard one to
dupe in my palette because I feel like
any rose gold shade you have or any
shade similar to that that's your
favorite use that in place of it this
one doesn't seem that unique it was hard
to do but it's not that unique does that
make sense no matter what I just highly
suggest this shadow though it's
beautiful next is the color that I feel
like is in all of my palette dupes this
is oatmeal tan I believe from Coastal
Scents
again this has mo7 on the back but I'm
pretty sure at this point I know that
it's oatmeal tan this is a matte shade
and it's perfect for a just easy crease
color I think this is a great color and
super affordable Coastal Scents just
blows me away with the quality for the
price especially when they run deals
that are like half off you can't beat it
the next color is the green shade this
is hard to dupe in my collection I ended
up going with the color slither and this
is from luke sea beauty as well it is
highly metallic and this one runs more
lime almost golden green than the other
color it was kind of contemplating it
with and this is also a bit lighter than
that color if you're going to be getting
the shade
looks beautiful and it swatches
beautifully but you'll definitely want
to use a base with this shadow because
these are just a bit thinner than you'd
expect these don't have that heavy
almost like I don't know dimethicone
like you know the think of forever
shadows or the makeup geek foiled those
feel like almost creamy to the touch
these just have a thinner texture so if
you're going to use them I haven't
suggest using them foiled as well as
having a almost sticky base for them to
go onto and they will stick and look
like that if you do that so pretty
though I think this is like definitely
my favorite shadow out of like the pops
of color in here the next shadow is one
from colour-pop and this is called
double date this is that nice purple
shade this is a shimmer color and it's
also really pretty I think that she did
a good job with the pops of color she
did decide to put in here again I
personally really like color pops
formula and I love the price point as
well so highly suggest this shade for
those last two shades I feel like for
what I could see in the palette they're
pretty dang close next is another one
from colour-pop
and this shade and the next shade were
kind of hard to do I felt like just so
many of my colors were so similar but
maybe not exactly on point and that's
where a lot of my bonus shades are gonna
come from it's just like basically I
know these peachy orange Coralie type of
colors could work really well and just
whatever you prefer type of situation
this is the matte shade flower boy I
really like this shade but I feel like
it is a bit powdery I still feel like it
looks great though on the eye I just
think that some people might be like
it's so powdery but it's still it's
still very pigmented it doesn't come off
patchy to me this is definitely more
unique I feel like in my collection and
I do really like this last this is
another one from luck see beauty and
this is in the color farro just a really
nice mid-tone warm brown anyone who's
into the warm tones you probably have
something similar to this if not been a
single shadow then probably somewhere in
your collection but I do think this is a
nice one to round out the palette what I
love about this palette is you really
can do so much you could wear this just
all over the lid blend it out one color
look you could put this on the lid and
blend it out in the crease with this or
in the outer corner you could do
something with these colors you could do
this with that I mean there's so many
different color options which is
really cool if you're looking at the
pallets that she released before I feel
like this one definitely has the is the
most unique and probably the one that I
would get out of all of them except I
feel like the Holiday palette was a bit
unique but just kind of ugly
I don't know anyway I heard it wasn't
very good quality anyway but yeah I'm
just gonna run these off I'm not gonna
do like insert shots of these so yeah
like I mentioned before this is Anasazi
as orange soda this could be a great
dupe for the first shade in the palette
or just in general it's very similar to
like the feel of the palette if you
don't have this and you want something
similar Peach Smoothie which is also
very popular from makeup geek is very
similar and again in the spirit of the
palette I decided to give you guys a
couple of options these are for
dreamboat which is the second shade that
I duped in the palette these aren't
shimmery they're both matte but they're
a bit more I guess neutral / cool toned
if you want something like that or don't
want to get drained out and want
something that's I don't know a
replacement this first one here is
makeup geeks creme brulee I really like
the shade I've obviously hit pan it's
really beautiful and that's just
something that is basically for the
people who already have this I believe
this is discontinued from Mac but this
is kid and this is definitely more cool
toned but it doesn't have that purple
undertone it's definitely still like
brown so definitely has more gray in it
but that's really nice if you already
have this this could work similarly to
the matte shade not the shimmer shade
that actually is in the palette this one
was hard guys okay this one was a little
hard next I wanted to bring up some
dupes for kind of that peachy shade the
third shade in the palette these are
just things that are in the same vein so
if you already have them or if you were
looking for more shades like that the
first one here is bittersweet orange
this was also in one of my last my
videos it's a nice peachy Coral almost
like a burnt peachy Coral and another
one that I've mentioned in past videos
this is reef coral this one is
definitely powdery it's not my favorite
shadow from Coastal Scents but I do want
Genet because I think color wise it's
really similar so if you have a good
base with it it just doesn't I don't
know maybe I don't suggest it it's very
powdery but that's it there it's
definitely interesting if you use it
with a base I definitely feel like it's
workable and fine but alone in a swatch
and everything it's definitely not
impressive
we're comparable to their other shadows
I was thinking about cutting that out
but I'm gonna leave it all in my option
for like a greeny gold
this is golden avocado from Coastal
Scents this is a really beautiful shadow
this has a great formula but it's like a
greeny gold so if you're looking for
something that's more like an antiquey
that's like a really bad swatch if
you're looking for something that's more
of that like antiquey gold this is a
really nice option I wanted to give you
guys a shimmery option for the last
color in the top row this is makeup
geeks flamethrower this is something I
feel like that's also been in so many of
the videos this isn't close but again
it's just in the spirit of the palette
if you want something really intense
this is like the amped up version of the
palette like if everything was just more
saturated then that's what this pound
would be but this is an absolutely
stunning shadow so if you already have
this you could try to maybe make some
looks and be inspired with this shadow
another one from makeup geek this is the
color jester and this is another dupe
for the green shadow this one's a little
bit deeper not as like limey green but
it's so beautiful I just couldn't not
mention it because I think it's just so
pretty and I feel like we don't all wear
green shadow so if you have this already
you don't need to get like another green
unless you're obsessed with green my
favorites recommend if these are all
just very similar and give me these
peachy warm brown orange e red Brown
vibes so I just thought I'd bring them
up the first one here is Tuscany this is
from Coastal Scents this is a matte
color it's kind of like a satin this is
a very almost like sheer shadow I really
like this this would be great in the
crease it'd be great all over the lid
for a very like almost subtle peachy
look if you're wanting to go almost like
monochromatic with it be really pretty
another shadow that's not a stranger to
the LUT stupid series this is
Oktoberfest from Coastal Scents I've
already hit pan in it I love this shade
this is a matte and it's just
I think it's so pretty I'm gonna swatch
it on top I just I really enjoyed this
shadow I've used it a ton and I think
it's great and the last shadow is
something from Lux II and this is a
matte shade called terracotta this is
what I'm wearing in the outer corner of
my eyes today I've really been enjoying
this I've worn it probably three days
straight again it's not gonna be as
smooth to the touch as makeup geek but I
feel like it performs just as well so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope
it wasn't too often the swatches I hope
it gave you some inspiration to look
within your own single shadows and your
own palettes event to just kind of get
the same inspiration the same vibes from
your own collection and create some
looks that you would do with the Kylie
palette if you had it I'm gonna need to
start keeping a list because I want to
keep all your recommendations but if you
have any other recommendations and if
there's a palette that you really want
to see me do leave it down below I'd
love to know your suggestions and it
just keeps me inspired and moving on to
the next palette I'm gonna end this
video here I hope it's not too long
thanks so much for watching guys I
really appreciate it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
