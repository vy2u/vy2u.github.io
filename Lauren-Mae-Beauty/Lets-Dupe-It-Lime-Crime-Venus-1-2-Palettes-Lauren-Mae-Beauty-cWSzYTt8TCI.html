Lawrence thanks so much for watching
this is another less dupit video I'm so
excited I took the time the other day to
look at all your requests write down all
these palettes and I've been just like
trying to do so many so that I can just
film one of these every time I film a
video so I'm excited to bring to you
today my line crime is Ilan and Venus -
it's a console video I decided to just
put them all in one now if you haven't
watched any of my less stupid series
before I will leave a link down below
but this is a series where I'm just
trying to go into my stash find similar
shadows to palettes that I don't already
have and help you guys out but also help
me realize I don't need every single
palette that comes out I have a lot of
shades that are very similar to shades
that are in palettes and I just don't
need to buy everything now that being
said I don't own a lot of the palettes
I'm trying to do because that's the
whole point of it so if colors are not
exactly on or finishes I'm doing the
best I can with what I have and if I
don't have something that's really exact
I really do try to just take inspiration
of what the palettes going for and kind
of put my own twist on it and do the
best I can
yeah like I said so I will say first off
the Venus one was the hardest one for me
to do it was really hard so this looks
like basically not like the palette I
feel like like this is nowhere near it
but I did like that I also have bonus
shades that I will show you after I show
you what was the most fitting for the
palette at least for what I thought and
hopefully that will help you guys get
inspiration within your own collection
again I'm only doing single shadows but
you could definitely do things in Palace
I just feel like these are easier if you
wanted to find one shade you can do that
alright I'll just show you it let's show
you it up front this is my dupe for a
one claim genus palette please please
eat here oh yeah I know I know it's not
very similar so I did the best I could
again so I'm just going to go through
what if I want these are my bonus shades
here and and we'll get into it first off
this is looksie beauty's maple this is a
matte shade very beautiful super
pigmented it's looking a little patchy
but I've used for farming I and it
doesn't look that way so I really do
like this look sue sells their shadows
for five dollars and I
mentioned this before but since they
don't have my video to refer you to yet
because I'm still testing about and want
to like have a really comprehensive
review these do have a bit of a thinner
formula they're not super buttery but
they are very pigmented and I do find
that they blend out really nicely so the
whole palette is very warm toned and
grungy so I do think this fits in very
nicely the next to learn how here is a
shadow that's been in a lot of my life
stupid and this is the color flower boy
from colour-pop this is a matte color as
well this has a lot more creamy formula
but it is a bit more powdery so that's
what it looks like swatched very
beautiful very bright this is definitely
brighter than what's in the palette but
again for what I have I felt like this
worked well and kind of brought a little
bit of spunk a little bit of spice
something a little different to the
palette and one of the closest I could
find to do this shade in the palette the
next shade that I have here is from
makeup geek and it is starry-eyed this
is a very beautiful color I believe that
the shade in the palette is sherry but I
think it might have a bit of a duochrome
it's probably not nearly this right is
blinding but hey if I don't have the
color and I'm going to kind of have to
do what I have to do this is the color I
just want to put in that palette so
that's why I chose this one this has
been a lot of my less stupid I just
really like this shade so I put it in
there I like it last for the topper of
the palette this is something from
Coastal Scents it's called pomegranate
red it's a matte red shade now I was
realizing as I was trying to dupe this
palette that I really don't have that
many grungy shades in like single
shadows I have a lot of like resin
oranges but they're not like they don't
have that like puke color thrown into
them does that make sense they're not
like that warm grungy they're more
crayon box type of colors or more like
pestle or brights or something so again
I'm doing my best but I feel like either
go for a similar palette which I will
show you the palette I think it's in the
similar or just go for the actual
palette if you really want it that bad
but anyway this is pomegranate red it's
pretty it's definitely you know lighter
this is from Coastal Scents and I don't
think this is a bad shadow by any means
because it is only two dollars but it's
not going to give you super opaque red
unless you have a white base but it will
blend out nicely so
kind of a compromise the next shadow
that I have to show you is hopelessly
devoted and this is from look see beauty
this is another map so I did put a lot
of maps in this palette to very opaque
brown topi gray shade this is a colored
color where the least out of the palette
it's very dark but if you want something
to deepen up this is a nice one
it's really hard just explaining all
these because I feel like they're so
different than what's in the template
next in the palette is they color some
Coastal Scents called darks mango again
this is just like a straight up or just
socially it's a little bit darker but
it's not I mean it doesn't have a crunch
to it let's pumpkin you know it's really
beautiful it's matte this definitely
have a better texture than the
pomegranate red so I definitely suggest
this over that one it feels like nice
and creamy feel like it swatches better
it's a little bit deeper true or two
color from what's in the pan and it's a
nice shadow if you're wanting orange
this is definitely a good one next I
have a color from colour-pop and it is
called dreamboat this is been in a few
of my other less stupid I love this
color it's so pretty it's just like so
romantic like grungy romantic if you
wanted to you could put this all over
the lid be done and like put it into the
crease and it's a one chatter look I
love this color and feels so soft and
just nice it's matte it's just it's a
good one this is definitely one I feel
like a lot of people would get a lot of
users and last another one from
colour-pop this is the color going study
again we have another match I mean I
mostly put all math in this palette this
is very pigmented it's a nice and dark
and purple this is a bit powdery but it
swatches nicely it blends out nicely so
that color is definitely different from
what's in the palette and overall I
don't like how this palette looks
together
it's not like it's ugly and it's not
like you can't make looks it's just not
very beautiful definitely doesn't have
the same alert as the Venus one so I'm
sorry I let you guys down on that one
but that comment was like thumbs up a
lot so I was like alright we'll go for
it and that's part of the reason I
wanted to put both of the palace in one
because I definitely feel like I did a
better job on the Venus 2 for bonus
shades before we get to Venus - I first
off wanted to just a palette and that is
the modern Renaissance
now this is not out when the Venus first
launched I feel like since that talent
has launched there are so many other
warm toned red toned palettes that have
come out I just don't feel like you need
the Venus palette from Lime Crime if you
don't want to buy Lime Crime because
it's Lime Crime or for whatever reason I
just suggest this palette it's beautiful
has those warm grungy tones it has this
is just one of my favorite palettes so
if you really wanted something very
similar and you just want to buy it all
in one this is a palette I suggest for
you but we'll go through the other bonus
shows that having single forms now these
are all a lot more like pinky purple
toned instead of like red and orange
tones but if you think they'd give you a
nice grungy mob look and when I was
trying to find you to rip these event
colors that came to mind self let me
swatch them for you really fast the
person here is look sees first kiss this
is a matte shade I believe this came out
with their matte spring shades for 2017
that looks way different on camera than
what it really looks like but it's very
light this would be a perfect like
transition shade or again like an
all-over color on the lid something
that's going to get a little bit of
definition a little bit of something but
nothing too dark next I have a shade
from coastal censuses wild brazen this
is another matte color and it's dark
like plummy brownish color purpley Brown
it doesn't swatch nearly as dark as it
is in the pan I like colors that are
crazy pigmented that are really dark
because I feel like I can just feather
them in a little bit easier and I just
don't get too carried away plus they're
easier to blend out so that one's nice I
have a couple from colour-pop this first
one here it's pinkie promise this is
actually a shimmer shade so if you're
wanting something with a little bit of
shimmer and shine this one's really
really beautiful it's nice and pigmented
and smooth looking I just felt like this
would look nice with the other colors I
picked for the palette so I wanted to
mention that the other dollar that I
have here from colour-pop is called
pretty cruel and this does have glitter
shot throughout it but other than that
it is called a matte on the website so
just a little warning on that it's a
beautiful color though it's basically
like dreamboat but like a couple shades
darker and with glitter I really like
this color again for like an all-over
one shadow look I'm really into very
simple eye makeup I feel like I
really like stuff that's too graphic I'd
rather have something that's more blown
out and like watercolor that's more my
style and the last boat of shades that I
have to show you is from makeup geek
it's the color showtime this is one of
their foiled shadows it's very beautiful
very similar to wild raisin but just
more pigmented and shimmery we have this
last one I don't really have much else
to say these are very similar tones it's
not really that similar to the palette
so hopefully you can take what you can
from this portion of the video all right
let's move on to the Venus - I feel like
it did a better job doing this palette
than I did the first one it just has
more of the color buys and although
these are all a bit off as well it's
just more similar feel like that's like
the Aliexpress Palace you know it's like
that's my side clothes let's just get
into these color swatches so we can move
on to bonus shades the first one here is
a bit different but I think really fun
and I really like it for this palette
this is the color Omega from looksie
Beauty this is just so do crime it's
crazy I don't know if you guys can see
it on camera kind of not really the
color and the palette isn't really
pretty like hunter green and I feel like
it had a bit of like shimmer duochrome
to it so I just thought this like looked
so nice you could definitely do
something really grungy and fun with
this with like the other colors in the
palette it just inspires me so much more
than that first one so this is a little
powdery but it's very pigmented really
beautiful and this has a better texture
if you like than some of the other
looksie beauties - the little softer
next is the color that I feel like so
many people like the Venus 2 palette for
and I decided to dupe it with the color
paper tiger from colour-pop this is in
matte like baby puke yellow Lee brown
shade really pretty these are the types
of shades that just adding an extra to
elope again I think this looks so pretty
with some of the other colors I have
here I think it looks beautiful though I
just love this shade in general and I
think it works well for the palette next
is a color that's probably the most
iconic color in the palette this is that
like light baby blue and I do not have
something that light and bright in my
collection in a single form that I can
like put in the palette so this is the
color that was closest this is Coastal
Scents cornflower blue this is a matte
shade has a very nice texture it's kind
of like a periwinkle it's a little bit
powdery it's not like horrible though
it's
I feel like for the price is like $2 I
think it's worth it for how often you're
probably going to use a color like this
too
I do suggest putting the white face down
you'll definitely get a better pop with
it it's definitely still workable though
and the last color for the top row this
is another one from coastal trends this
is the color soft clover getting the
tone on this was kind of hard this is
also kind of powdery but again if you
blended this out I feel like you could
definitely get a nice look with it it's
just a nice green it's almost like a
jungle green it's a satin chain so it
has a tiny tiny bit of a sheen but I
definitely think it could pass and work
as a mask next in the realm you could
probably use any like light shimmery
shades that you wanted or enjoy using
but I decided to use Mac's room the
reason I chose this is because it
definitely has a bit of a shine to it
and a shimmer but it's nothing too much
like it hits the light and looks nice
but it just doesn't give too much color
payoff and I thought I'd just work well
with the rest of the palette and how I
would create looks with the palette so I
like this one but again you can use
whatever you have and that you enjoy at
home I feel like it would give a very
similar look I'm repeating a color from
the first palette this is looksie
beauty's maple and I think this works
really well I think this is just such a
pretty color it's just beautiful I love
this I will bring this on the outer
corner of the eye you could put shroom
on the lid put paper tiger and the
crease put this on do something with
that Omega if you wanted to or just
leave it more simple I really do like
this shade it's nice the next dupe I
have is from makeup geek and this is
cherry cola this is another matte and
it's a really beautiful dark shade but
it has it's like brown and plum just so
pretty this also doesn't swatch nearly
as dark as the color is but it blends
out beautifully so you just have to
build it up a little bit I love it it
has that under tartar that purple
because it really brings out the blue
and green in people's eyes I highly
suggest it and the last shade in the
palette I believe is a black it's like a
sparkly block I do not have a black
single shadow I have so many blacks and
palettes there is no way I'm going to
buy a black single shadow for a long
long time so I suggest using any black
you already have because you probably
have a bunch of them I do decide to put
a colors out just so
complete this is the color chocolate
here and this is from Coastal Scents and
I just chose this because it's a nice
brown shade I don't personally love
using blacks I'm very clear so black
tends to look really really harsh on me
I decided to add kind of like a neutral
Brown to the palette if I wanted to use
it in this way I just feel like it could
ground the look maybe make things a
little bit darker this is a nice
background from Coastal Scents - if you
were wanting one
let's move on to my bonus shades because
I have just a few grains a few yellows
and that blue so I'm going to start off
with the blue this is not any single
shadow that you can just buy and pop
into a palette but it is a single shop
you can buy in packaging do this from
Illamasqua and this is the color anya
this is a really nice bright matte blue
i feel like this is very similar to
what's in the palette this is so velvety
soft from feeling the other chatter but
i had this just doesn't compare it's so
much softer than those and it's so
pigmented for how pastel this is it
performs a like amazing I've worn this
on the eye and I really do like it so if
you really want that blue and you're
willing to splurge this is a great
shadow I wanted to give you some dupes
for that kind of like yellowy brown
shade the first one here terms look see
beauty and this is pumpkin spice life
this is a little bit more mustard and
like darker than paper tiger I really do
like this a little bit more orange
really pretty I love colors like this
and if you like colors like this you'll
like this the other shadow that I have
here is cantaloupe slide from Coastal
Scents you guys have heard me talk about
this a bit and this is just a nice light
yellow so if you want something a little
bit lighter instead of darker this is a
really nice one I love using this and
blending it into my brow area just to
give some nice like yellow to my eyelid
without it being just like the main
focal point Alex to me I guess it kind
of is but it doesn't feel like that to
me that's what it swatches out like it's
very kind of sheer has like a medium
opacity so I do really like that shadow
next for the green shade I have a couple
dates this is B color n02 from Coastal
Scents I will leave the actual color
name link down below in the description
this is another matte and this is a
little bit more of like a true like
jungle green that has more of that blue
and it's really pretty a little powdery
but still nice definitely something I'd
keep and would use and enjoys and the
last shadow I have to show you is the
color olive from Coastal Scents this is
another matte but this one just has it's
just more warm tone doesn't have that
blue in it and that's just lucky but
they are really pretty so it just kind
of depends on what you want and what
your preferences are both are matte
though which i think is wonderful and I
know I mentioned a couple times like the
quality of the Coastal Scents I just
want you guys have like so
right expectations for what you're
getting the $2 shadow I feel like
pigmentation it's really nice for the
price and I would use these and I think
they're really nice again for the price
so I hope you guys weren't too
disappointed with how this let's do pit
turns out I did my best
let me know what you guys thought down
below you guys have any like good
palette dupes maybe leads us down below
for people to look at and know about as
well but since so many of you guys
wanted to see this video I didn't want
to not do it but personally this is like
my least favorite applaud out of walls
up so this is their first one like check
out the other ones please okay guys
that's everything thank you so much for
