Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a dupe video for the
lorac I love brunch palette now I did do
a first impression review and swatches I
will have that link down below
you guys will all be happy to know that
I am going to be returning that palette
but I was kind of thinking that before I
did since I had the palette I would try
to dupe it and then I also got a request
in the comment section to actually fill
in the dupes videos so I went through my
collection and I decided to only go
through my single shadows so I mostly
have a single shadows from makeup geek
Coastal Scents I have some color pop as
some anastacio those are mostly it but
any eyeshadow that you can buy in a
single pan is what I went through to try
to do these colors the best I could not
everything is a hundred percent match
either in color or unfinished but I feel
like I've done a really good job of
recreating the feel of the palette the
inspiration of the palette and I feel
like you could get very very similar
looks it's not the same looks out of the
colors that I picked to dupe the lorac
palette so overall I'm really happy with
it
if you guys watch the review video you
know that the palette had really poor
pigmentation so I feel like all the
shadows that I've duped it with are way
better in pigmentation so they might be
slightly darker than the other shades
but I feel like some of that can be just
because of the fact that these are
actually pigmented and have pigment so I
guess I'll show you the palettes now I
just keep talking so this is the lorac I
love brunch palette it's all pastels
it's part of their spring 2016
collection so that's what that looks
like and then for the shadows that I
picked these are all of them here now I
did accidentally crack one of my shadows
this morning which was a sad sad moment
this gray one but I tried to repress it
you know save it a little bit if you
guys follow me on instagram you guys
already saw the picture of me holding
these up together and I kind of was
showing you guys there but that's kind
of the best I can do holding it up but
this is a representation but if you want
to see a better picture of comparison of
the two palettes next to each other
check out my Instagram it's always
linked down below I am wearing a lot of
the shades today on my eyes I'm wearing
this in my crease along with a little
bit of this in my crease and then this
on the
I did put this kind of in my inner brow
but I did cover that up with urban case
savage I just wanted something a little
brighter and then this white shimmery
shade is in my inner corner I think I'm
gonna make this another series and I
really love series if you can't tell
like I'm just obsessed but I just like
having that kind of organization to my
channel I am going to be doing this
hopefully with a lot of other palettes
let me know if you have any specific
suggestions down below but I am going to
be doing the Too Faced honey palette I
think next let's get into swatches all
the information will be on the screen
regarding the shadows which one is from
the lorac and which one is the dupe and
then also all these shadows will be
linked down below for your convenience
if you really wanted to just get one or
two of the shades I hope this helps
anyone who wanted this palette but
didn't think the pigmentation was good
or for anyone who just wanted a couple
of the shadows but didn't on everything
you can just kind of pick the shadows
you want since these are all available
for individual purchase that's
everything for me here I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
