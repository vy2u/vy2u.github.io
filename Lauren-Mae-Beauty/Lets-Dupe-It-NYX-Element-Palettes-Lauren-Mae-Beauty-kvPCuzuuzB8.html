Lauren thank you so much for watching I
apologize for my voice still I don't
know what is wrong with me it just
sounds like that anyway we're doing a
new let's do pit today and this is a
little bit different because today we're
duping a bunch of palates I recently saw
on trend mood that NYX is coming out
with a whole set of element inspired
palettes and on top of that they are all
in collaboration with a different
influencer which i think is so cool and
I'm sure a lot of you guys along with me
we're really interested in these
palettes before they showed the inside I
was so excited I was like these are
gonna be so cool I think it's such a
cool idea you guys know how I am if
there is an inspiration and they follow
through with that I'm so down and
although I do like the idea of these and
I do think that overall these could be
good palettes the swatches that I've
seen look really nice and pigmented I
don't think that I will be buying any
and some of the reasons are one a lot of
the colors in these palettes seem to
repeat themselves so much I feel like
they almost could have cut the palettes
in half and had the same color idea and
it would have been translated and there
would have been just so many similar
colors again these are all just from
swatches online and looking at pictures
online I haven't seen them in person I
don't know if they're even out yet and
they don't know when they do come out I
don't know how much they retail for but
anyway I thought it would be fun to try
to dupe them in my collection and come
up with some palettes that are inspired
by air water metals earth what else is
there water air metals earth fire and
wind wind aha that was one I was missing
anyway we're just gonna get straight
into it because it's gonna be a long
video I do have a demo of this entire
look at the end too if you want to stay
tuned to that you guys can probably
guess which palette I used and really if
anything I just hope this inspires you
to go through your collection see if you
have similar colors I'm not saying that
these palettes are gonna be bad or that
you shouldn't get them I just think more
than anything you definitely don't need
all of them
I feel like wind and water specifically
looks so similar it's just like a bunch
of blues and you just like who uses that
many blues like no one I know anyway
let's just get into the palette
I created a few disclaimers if you
haven't seen my let's do batteries
before check out the playlist I am not
intending to do exact colors and this
one specifically since I'm cutting the
pallets in half I'm only showing you six
shadows for each pallet so they're not
going to be exact color dupes but it is
inspiration dupes I'm trying to take the
spirit of the pallet and condense it
down into only six shadows so whatever
popped out at me the most in those
pallets is what I chose to put in the
pallet so anyway you hope you enjoy and
I hope it helps you if you are wanting
these but kind of wanted to see some
alternatives here are my first off I'm
going to start off with the air pallet
this is what I used for my look today
and I tried to keep those pastels in the
pallet that was my main inspiration I
kind of kept a more warm side and then a
cooler side with the purples and the
greens and blues up top is whimsical
this is a really pretty oil shadow from
makeup geek I have this on my lid today
and it's just a nice bright lid shade I
feel like you could use it as an inner
corner highlight you could use it on the
on the face as a highlight if you really
wanted to but I thought this would just
be a nice color to add in here and
almost crown the look because you could
use this with so many different shadows
and something else I will say about
these palettes that I've created they
aren't necessarily standalone palettes
so you're not getting everything you
would potentially need to make an eye
look you're just getting the the best
part things that you might not already
have in your collection otherwise and
then you can bring in those shadows that
you want to use on top of these to
create a really cool look oh my gosh my
voice you guys next let's talk about the
pink this is the hot pot in bo1
I will leave the actual name listed down
below this is a mag and it's what I have
on my counter corner this isn't as
bright as the pink and the palette this
one's a bit more bubblegummy it's a
little bit lighter but it's what I felt
like I had in my collection that would
work really well and I really liked how
it worked with this look specifically so
I do like that one and then last in that
row is petal peach this one is such a
beautiful shade it's a perfect
transition orange peachy color I highly
suggest this shadow as well this is from
Coastal Scents it's a matte it's a great
color to have certain
at the top of the next column this is
makeup geek state dreamer and this is
another one of the foiled shadows I
thought it would be fun to add another
like pop of shimmer in here but
something that was a little bit more
whimsical and fun this is a really
pretty lavender color it is a bit more
cool toned and I think it's just such a
nice shade again for the lid or even the
inner corner if you're doing something a
little bit more avant-garde or fun
the next color in the palette is sea
Lily again from Coastal Scents all of
these are coastal scents or makeup geek
this is a really pretty teal it's a
matte which is so nice I have it on my
lower lash line today and it's a
beautiful beautiful color again for the
price the quality of this is very very
nice and last to bring a bit more of a
blue and not too much a green this is
cornflower blue from Coastal Scents
it's another matte so you are getting a
really good mix of mattes and shimmers I
feel like in this set of shadows that
I've created and I really do like this
something I really like about the color
selection of these is I've created a
look that I wouldn't normally create
like I wouldn't go into my shadows and
necessarily come up with this but
because I was working from these shadows
I was creative and came up with
something a little bit different from my
normal everyday wear so I really do like
this obviously you could interchange any
colors that you want I know there's like
a light yellow but some of those shadows
I don't know if they have different
finishes like duo crumbs but I think do
Chrome's have been so cool in this
collection if they aren't in there
already and I think some of those
lighter shades depending on how
pigmented they are might tend to look
the same on the lid so I tried to go
with colors that will actually look
different from each other on the eye and
that's kind of my inspiration for all of
these six pan mini palettes I created
next let's talk about the fire quad I
feel like this is the one that
everyone's gonna go crazy of for this is
the one it's gonna be the most popular
and I don't have some of those signature
Reds that you saw in that palette it
kind of winged with a little bit of
something different took different
colors for inspiration and I really like
the way I've also coordinated them in
the palette so you can definitely get
something more monochromatic with this
side you can mix them together and get
something really cool or you could stick
to this side and be really really warm
and like Sun setting so there's a lot of
different
the first one on the top is from Coastal
Scents this is the color bronze peach
and I thought this would just be a nice
transition something that isn't too too
peachy or pink just really beautiful
again I've talked about this before my
channel this was in my everyday makeup
palette so I do really love this color
and again that is a matte going down the
column flower boy looks like it's gonna
be really similar but this is definitely
a lot brighter of a color you're gonna
get a different look for sure so
although they may look similar they are
not it I really like this color from
colour-pop it's beautiful it looks great
as a pop on the middle of the lid it
also would have been really nice with
the air palette potentially too but I
think this is just a really nice
addition to the fire palette and then
last in that column this is the darkest
color in the palette and this is wild
raisin again from Coastal Scents you
guys I'm really like in the Coastal
Scents this is a nice berry purple color
it's gonna give you depth but it's still
a bit warmer it's not a straight-up
Brown and again I think these look so
nice together one of the palettes I'm
really really wanting are the dose of
colors like marvelous moths and I don't
know the brown one whatever that one is
those look so pretty I really want them
but we'll see how long it can hold off
anyway I think that those look really
really pretty
again you could create such a nice like
monochromatic soft look with this and
then you have this to kind of punch up
some depth if you want to and now for
the other side of the palette we have
some more of those really warm tones so
the first one here is cantaloupe slice
nothing new to my channel this is a
really nice matte yellow so far all of
the colors in here have been matte and I
really love this you guys have seen me
use this on the like inner brow bone
area
I've used this us at inner corner
highlight this is great as a transition
so many ways to use this love this
shadow again coastal sand is so
affordable and I really like their
colors next is just the straight-up
orange this is like pumpkin orange basic
orange and this is the color marmalade
from Coastal Scents again it's a nice
Matt I think that paired with some of
these other colors you really could get
to thing really interesting and warm
maybe a little bit enough something
different from the other warm pellets
that you already have that was another
kind of inspiration for me is to do
something maybe a slightly different
than what you might have in your naked
heat or similar yes please palette
intosh you didn't own a sunset palette
anything like that although these are
very similar and I feel like if you have
those palettes you don't need to justify
getting out of all of the next ones the
fire palette next is my Oktoberfest from
Coastal Scents this dropped and broke
even more than I've already had so I
need to get a new one of these because
this is one of my favorite shades this
is just a beautiful warm mid-tone Brown
this can tie any look together I love it
so so much in the outer corner it really
brings out the blue in my eyes and I
think it would look so pretty with some
of these but it looks so good with these
I just feel like you can get a bunch of
different looks from just these six
shadows and they could potentially be so
different from each other which is
something I really like and all of the
shadows in that palette were matte all
right next for these palettes let's talk
about the metals my inspiration for this
was obviously metallic so everything in
here has a really high shine finish I
also wanted to pull the inspiration of
the purples and green and that burgundy
that were in here but then the other
half are neutral metals so I think it's
a really nice mix again this would not
be good for a standalone palette
necessarily but if you brought in some
of your favorite mats you could make
some really awesome looks with this
palette going down the first row this
one here is magic act from makeup geek
this is one of her foiled shadows a lot
of them are going to be the foiled
shadows just because they have such a
high shine on them this is a really nice
light bold be great for all over the lid
next we have makeup geeks grandstand
this is a bit darker and this would be
great for all over the lid as well but
for something a little bit more earthy
and smoky I love this color I think it's
so pretty it's kind of this mix of
something warm and something cool if you
put in my warm tones it looks a little
bit cooler if you put it by cool tones
it looks a little bit warmer such a
pretty color and then I
the green paired nicely with those two
shapes so I kept it in the same column
this is gesture from a cupcake just that
high shine such a pretty green oh I love
it so much I think you could definitely
do something where you have both of
those on the lid and then blend out with
a really nice matte brown or whatever
you want to do but those look so nice
together
moving on to the other column the last
neutral in here this is mesmerize from
makeup geek and this is a nice like more
gray color if you want something taupey
or cool toned this would be the color
for you so pretty I could think it's
just so many pretty like almost a jewel
tone smokey eyes you could do going into
fall I feel like that palette really
looks like fall along with the earth
palette next is from colour-pop this is
pinky rose and it's a nice burgundy this
isn't as high shine I feel like as the
other ones well it's pretty it's pretty
good it doesn't have quite a foiled it's
definitely metallic but not quite foiled
so that one is beautiful and last year I
have Caitlyn Rose this is from makeup
geek this one takes a little bit more
building up it's not going to be as
metallic on the first swatch but you can
build this color up and it just brings a
nice like royal pop to these something a
little bit different once again and
that's something I really wanted it's
just some different inspiration they had
a really pretty purple in the palette
this one's a little bit different but
out of what I had this was the closest
to that in a nice like high metallic
finish overall I think these are just so
so pretty I just when I look at all
those palettes there are just so many
that are so similar it's like we all
just already have so many shadows that I
feel like to justify getting new ones
they really need to see something
different and not get a bunch of repeat
shades of stuff I already have or that
are already in the same palette that's
the biggest thing and I feel like I've
been seeing that a lot lately where it's
like it's okay to have less shadows and
there to be no repeats than to have like
a bunch of repeats but it's a big
palette like what come on
next we're getting into the blue
palettes which are the wind and water
this one is the wind but if you look at
those two pictures they are very very
similar the biggest difference is that
wind is a bit more blue whereas water
has a little bit more green to it but
honestly there is no way you need both
of these for sure I don't care who you
are you don't need both of them
if anything one but even then I feel
like there are so many blues that are so
similar I don't know
I'm not feeling those pallets but then
again I'm not really a blue eyeshadow
person so anyway let's just get into my
picks for these I feel like between what
I picked for the wind palette and when I
picked for the water you can mix and
match and just pick your favorite six
first off though this is the color polar
bear this is basically just a matte
white I thought it would just be nice to
have something like you know more basic
not just an extra blue this is be great
to set the entire lid put on the brow
bone and put on the inner corner but to
give more of like a matte highlight than
something shimmery going down that
column we have a neutral this is bedrock
from makeup geek it's a matte gray when
I swap to this next to the blues it
almost looks warm because the Blues are
so cool this is just a nice transition
something to kind of ground the look if
you don't want just a bunch of blue
Gray's are gonna be a great way to
transition out of a blue and then I did
want like a pop of color and a pop of
blue this is Neptune from makeup geek
this is a matte and this is a
traditional like cobalt blue the formula
on this is good but I do suggest using a
primer so you get the best pigmentation
from this this just adds something a
little bit brighter and different to my
selection of Blues we almost have
counsel to you but it's just wrong guys
all right next we have sea spray from
Coastal Scents again another matte I
think I'm really trying to put a lot of
mattes in here this is a very very light
blue so you could use this as a
transition you could use this on the lid
for something really light I'm not gonna
sit here and really sell you on the
Blues if you like them you'll like them
if you don't you don't so so that's one
of the six next is something shimmering
this is Pegasus from makeup geek this is
so pretty if I had to suggest the blue
to you I do really like this one it's
just so beautiful guys if you're gonna
get a blue and you like them this is a
great mid tone really foiled bloom and
last is yet another makeup geek foiled
in the color center stage this is just a
really dark midnight blue it's gonna add
some nice definition although it's
shimmery I think it still works well on
the palette I feel like at least these
are all different tones and you could
bring in other things if you really want
to just
one of these pop in a neutral look you
could do that as well I don't think a
lot of people are rocking just like a
straight-up blue eye on the Reg this is
the other blue palette this is the water
inspired palette and I promise you
they're different I did choose different
shadows I did try to go with a more
green theme so a couple of these are duo
Chrome's which i think is a nice fun
twist but overall again they're very
similar starting off in the first column
I have limelight from Luxy Beauty this
is a duochrome green color so pretty if
you have the cap on the alchemists
palette or the moonchild palette both of
those duochrome greens are very similar
to this this would be so pretty on the
inner corner or you could lay it over
any of these shadows just to kind of
give it a different finish which i think
would be really pretty
next is a color from itsy and this is
the color of fair longs very own
pheromones pheromones I don't know it's
French and so this is a matte blue but
again it's like more of like a deeper
teal on my camera it's looking a little
more blue than it is definitely it's
kind of like axis or one of those colors
from the subculture palette and last for
that column is the color brownstone from
Coastal Scents again I just wanted to
throw in a cooler toned Brown or
something to kind of ground the look if
you wanted something that wasn't
straight up blue or green and this is
just the next one again for like a
transition or deepening up the outer
corner starting with the next column we
have another like seafoam green this is
the third one I've shown and they're all
different once again this is the color
m12
from Coastal Scents this is another
matte this is very similar to the one in
the air palette I don't feel like you
need both of them such a nice map though
it's creamy its pigmented it looks
really nice I do really like it
next is the color Lake Shore this is
from Coastal Scents as well this is on
my top 15 Coastal Scents eyeshadows I
will leave a link down below if you want
to check that out this is a duochrome
and it feels so good
this has a really nice heavy texture to
it so it feels like one of those makeup
Forever's shadows and this has a blue
gold shift to it so that would just be
fun it's called Lake Shore definitely
water inspired and I thought it'd be a
nice way to bring the shadow in this is
what it probably suggests out of all of
them the most this one
we're almost done with the blues guys
alright the next one here is the color
Capri blue from Coastal Scents this is a
shimmer cobalt blue really bright really
fun
it's a Neptune's shimmery brother really
really pretty once again those are my
blue colors I'm so over them I'm ready
to get them off my hand but if you like
blues I hope that those two palettes
really got you going we're on the last
one this is the earth palette and this
is probably my favorite configuration of
shadows out of everything probably since
we're going into fall I just I love the
way that these look we're gonna get
straight into it the first shadow here
is from Coastal Scents this is pumpkin
pie this is a really great matte I love
this as a transition color I love this
all over the lid just a one shadow look
so so pretty it's going to help blend
any of these shadows in that same column
I went with the color going study from
colour-pop again another matte a lot of
them in this palette are matte and I
think that they just look so pretty
such a beautiful color if you haven't
tried the color drop shadows highly
suggest them they're really really good
affordable blendable creamy like I
really like almost everyone I've tried
the only shimmer sheet in here is the
green this is balsam from Coastal Scents
and ah it's so pretty very similar to
jester again if you have jester you
don't need this I just thought it would
give different options and you know
repeating the same shades so that is
balsam I think going steady in that
color would be so pretty together oh so
pretty and for the top of the next
column the first shadow I have is
pumpkin spice life from luck see Beauty
this is such a beautiful color this is
very similar to edge in the subculture
palette or do a wave I feel like those
are pretty similar buttons so pretty
next is another one from luck see Beauty
this is the color terracotta it's a nice
like warm brown orange color so
beautiful look at these colors together
guys so pretty and then just to tie in
some depth this is the color chocolate
from it see again that French brand a
matte nice dark deep brown these all
just look like velvet to me what
I love so that is my growth palette I
think it's so pretty I love it so much I
really hope you enjoyed this portion of
the video and my kind of like
inspiration if anything I hope it I hope
it gets you going and looking through
your collection obviously you can look
through your actual palettes and see if
you have some of our colors and even
just get inspiration from these sets of
colors to find things that are really
gonna fit you I'm gonna go into some
swatches of just like the full
collection together so you can see what
they look like in the pan and what they
look like on the skin just swatch it all
together and then we'll get into the
demo if you want to stay attuned to that
and see how I got this like so thank you
so much for watching guys and let's get
on swatches
I'm fair-faced cuz I don't know what
palette I want to use yet I was kind of
thinking about using the air palette it
just kind of I don't know it was calling
to me a little bit so I'm probably gonna
use this I don't even know what six pans
is but those six shades for whatever
reason I have lost my primer for my eyes
so I'm gonna be using the concealer I'll
be using later this is from Eden
minerals and I'm just taking the lighter
side I'm just going to put that all over
my lids and spread it out with my finger
and then to set that I'm just gonna be
using this matte cream shade from the
Physicians Formula quad I just realized
I probably should have done my brows so
I'm going to be using my ELF brow pencil
to fill in most of my brow I'm going in
with a new product because I lost my
color pop or a pencil somehow so in the
outer portion of my brow I'm gonna go in
with this YBF one it only comes in one
shape but it's pretty dark and I'll just
have that darkness at the end of my brow
and then just set it because that YBF
one is so dark I'm not gonna add any
more pigment I'm just gonna be using
this clear brow gel from black up to
hold them in place
brows are on they're a little bit dark
but I think it'll work out with the rest
of the look first off I'm going to be
going into this shade here this is the
color petal peach I'm gonna be running
that through my crease I'm probably
gonna stick to this side of the six pans
make that kind of like a trio I just
tend to not really love and gravitate
toward cooler toned eyeshadows or greens
and blues so now that I have that in my
crease I'm going to take the pink shade
and I'm going to be putting that on the
outer portion of my eye and then for the
inner portion of my blood I'm gonna go
in with whimsical from makeup geek I'm
just going in with my finger and I'm
gonna put that on the lid and now I'm
just gonna go back in and kind of deepen
up those color so I'm going back in with
petal peach to put on the outer portion
of the eye and then I'm going to pump up
that pink a little bit as well so that
it's nice and bright but this look isn't
going to have a ton of definition
I really want that area spec to stay
with it since that's the whole
inspiration for these shadows and now
I'm going back in with the pink and I'm
really patting that on so I get the most
pigmentation I'm so sorry about my voice
guys I feel like lately it's been worse
than ever
I really like where this is going I'm
gonna move on to liners really fast one
is a white liner for my waterline the
other one is just like a purple liner
I'm gonna be using that to tightline
with I'm gonna run the tiniest amount on
my lower lash line as well and then I'll
be back I hope I'm in focus I have no
idea before we move on with anything
else on the eyes I'm gonna finish up the
face for primer today I'm gonna be going
in with the cover effects blurring
primer I've really really been liking
this it's very similar to the benefit
Porefessional though so I feel like it
does control my oils quite well but it
gives me a nice base to work on nothing
too mattifying or too like just hard to
blend on top of and for foundation today
I'm really excited I'm using a new one
to my channel this is the tint idol
ultra wear makeup stick foundation from
Lancome and I just got sent this from
oculi I am so excited I've used this
twice now and I really do like it it's a
little bit light for my skin at the
moment and maybe a little pink but it
looks so beautiful on the skin I love
how easy it is I honestly don't even
feel like I need to really set this too
much which is nice especially just for
easy days it goes on so great if you
think that the outer blush vanish stick
foundation like blends and easily
this one's an even more seamlessly than
that one I really really like it so I'm
gonna plug this in with just a cookie
brush it's like I don't have to do
anything it just blends in as you can
tell it looks a little bit like because
it is but the finish of this is so nice
it's exactly what I've been liking
lately nothing too heavy you can build
it up if you want a little bit more
coverage but I just feel like this looks
so great as a nice soft matte finish on
the skin I'm really liking it I'm so
excited I'm gonna wear tomorrow cuz
we're going on a boat what I'm soaked
for that for concealer again I'm going
in with the Eden minerals I am just
using the lighter side and I just take
my finger and kind of put the most
coverage right on the inner corner and
then I just blend out with my finger so
many of you guys in my video where I
give only used five products said my
skin looked so good and like this is all
I had on it so I've really been enjoying
using this lately now that I have on my
base products and I'm going in with the
kiss Pro touch loose setting powder it's
just translucent you guys know I like
setting my inner portion of my face I
like sending the center of my face with
this come in under the eyes it just
helps make sure things stay in place all
day but it's just nice and lightweight
and then for the rest of my face I'm
going to be using this Sephora powder
and this will also help with you know
kind of bringing a little bit more color
back to my face since it's a little bit
of a light foundation for me at the
moment I think that one winter it'll
look really good for bronzer I'm just
using an old favorite this is the butter
bronzer from Physicians Formula I really
wanted to keep that kind of pastel vibe
going so I'm going in with my illamasqua
blush and lover and I'm just going to be
putting that on my cheeks and then for
my highlight I thought going in with the
Kat Von D Alchemist would be fun it's
kind of like doom chrome and air like
and I thought I went with it so the
color to use though I think I'm gonna
use amethyst which is the purpley one I
might go in a little heavy too than
normal just to kind of have it show up
oh yeah I am I am glowing I am pulling
at the moment to finish up this look
we're gonna go in on the bottom lash
line and you know what
I'm gonna use some greens and blues I
was thinking about it it's like I think
it'd be fun to add that pop of color
there so first up I'm gonna go in with
the like a teal color and I'm gonna run
that almost like basically the whole
lash line so that teal color this one
definitely turned up cooler and like
more blue than I thought so I'm gonna
leave it there just so it stays light
for my inner corner though I'm gonna go
in with the highlight color we used from
the kat von d palette and just put that
on my inner corners hopefully that will
just like tie it all together well it
took a more fierce turn than I thought
for lips I'm going in with finders
keepers it's a lipgloss from colour-pop
and I just want to keep it pretty
neutral you know my style y'all know I
think blacks all we have left is mascara
so I will put that on and I will show
you guys the final look alright guys
that is the finished look I really hope
you enjoyed the demo as well as the rest
of the video I don't know what I said
there yet because I haven't filmed that
part yet but I do really like the look
it's very soft and airy I don't know I
feel like a really pretty clown like a
sugar pill clown or something I don't
know anyway that is everything I hope
this video helped if you were tempted by
those pallets though and I will see you
in the next one thank you so much for
watching my face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
