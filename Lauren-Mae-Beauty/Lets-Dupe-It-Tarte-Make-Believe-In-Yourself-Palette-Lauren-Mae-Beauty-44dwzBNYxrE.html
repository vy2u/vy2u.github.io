learn thanks so much for watching this
is going to be another episode of my
let's do pit series and we're gonna be
talking about the tart make believe in
yourself palette I know this is one that
people are really trying hard not to buy
and I myself was there at one point but
I have officially decided that I don't
need this palette and here are my dukes
I'm gonna share with you some of the
eyeshadows in my collection that I think
are very similar to what's in the
palette and if you have some of these or
if you just want a couple of the shades
these are some options you could buy
individually if you haven't watched my
let's stupid series before I will leave
a playlist linked down below so you can
check more out but this is supposed to
be a way for us to encourage each other
to shop our stashes to check out what
else we have in our collection so that
we can actually love what we already
have and not always feel like we need to
buy the next new thing these aren't
going to be exact I don't have the
palette but these are as close as I
could get by looking at different
swatches online and I try to keep in
mind the inspiration of the palette the
spirit of the palette and I sometimes
put my own little twist on it
I don't know so let's get into the
eyeshadows there is only one matte
shadow in this whole palette and it's a
warm brown color I honestly feel like
you could do any warm brown that you
have in your collection any Brown that
you feel like works is a great
transition color for you
that's what I would put in for you for
this palette if you're making it at home
but what I felt like was closest in my
collection is the color Tuscany from
Coastal Scents it's just a nice matte
warm brown this one has quite a bit of
red in it too so you could definitely do
something like Mac soft brown which I
will show you a bonus shades at the end
but this was something I thought looked
really close with the whole palette now
for the rest of the palette it's a bunch
of really pretty metallic shades I went
with a lot of makeup geeks foiled
shadows because they are very high
intensity high shine and I feel like
they really are great dupes for what the
palette was going for so the first shade
I have here is the color grandstand and
this is a really beautiful and what is
it like a warm toned almost like taupey
color this is very shimmery and metallic
but it's definitely still a neutral my
commentary
these eyeshadows is going to be so weird
next is the color flamethrower from
makeup geek this is Ben and a lot of
them I really like this shadow though I
should do a tutorial on it soon I feel
like this is a bit more vibrant than
what is in the palette but I feel like
it's absolutely beautiful and you can
always you know not do it as intense but
it definitely can build up to something
really intense and fiery next is another
one that was in my last palette this is
the color gesture from makeup geek again
it just has such a beautiful shine on it
I love the quality of these shadows now
these do retail for $10 a piece so if
you buy all of these at one time you're
definitely gonna have a better value of
buying the palette but I feel like you
could substitute these for so much more
and you don't have to buy them all at
once you could just buy the shades you
want so keep that in mind I don't know
how exactly says to the one in the
palette but I feel like it's very
similar it definitely keeps the same
idea going and last for the neutrals at
least for a while this is the color
mesmerized again from makeup geek it's
one of their foils this is a really
pretty topi gray super metallic really
pretty this might be a bit darker than
what's in the palette but I think that
again with that foiled all of these are
going to give you a really pretty like
metallic look now we're moving into
blues and these were kind of hard to get
exact tones but I feel like it did okay
this is the color periwinkle from
Coastal Scents it's a bit powdery so
just keep that in mind but pigmentation
on it it's absolutely beautiful it
almost sounds like a purple shift it's
very slight but very beautiful not quite
as metallic but definitely still a
shimmer finish and it's really beautiful
the next color I have is the color Lake
Shore from Coastal Scents this is a
actual duochrome
it's a blue teal color but then it has a
golden shift to it the way this feels
and swatches is very similar to the
makeup geek foiled
it's very metallic it has that like
heavy just nice feeling to it so I
highly suggest this shadow and I think
the quality of its very very nice for
the price it's definitely very
comparable to these $10 eyeshadows and
it's only two dollars this one
me encompasses what I think of this
palette being or what it should have
been the most because it has that dual
cup to it it's just something more
exciting and special so I highly suggest
this one and I think it works for the
dupe I made it in the palette and last
for the blue shadows this is the color
Pegasus from makeup geek this is
absolutely stunning if you were wanting
this color in the palette just pick up
this shade you will be so happy
it is just so pigmented like look how
much alack that is compared to the
others it's crazy right I really like
the shadow I've never gonna look with it
yet I know that's so sad but I need to
and I think it's really pretty again
this one to me is really fun and
exciting in the palette and last year
round out the outside of this circle we
have some just kind of not boring but
basic shimmer shades you could do
whatever you wanted with these but I I
wanted to keep it with the really bright
blinding metallic shade so I continued
to dupe them with the makeup geek foiled
shadows the first one here is starry
eyed this one is more neutral in tone
it's just so pretty this is my absolute
like this is one of my favorite shadows
from makeup geek ever this will look
good on everyone I highly suggest it
this is another one that's like you
should definitely have this in your
collection you will love it and the last
one in the circle this is in the
spotlight from makeup geek this is a
peachy shade so it's still very light
but it has a definite peach undertone
look at how those just catch the light
it's crazy but hopefully you can see
there how it has that it's just more
peachy of a base than the starry eyed
color now the center of the palette is a
pretty large shadow and it is a
duochrome shadow I was looking online
and I couldn't see quite what the flash
of the duochrome was and I didn't want
to sit through videos I know that's kind
of like I'm just being honest with you
guys I didn't want to go sit through
another video I even though I've watched
a video on the palette so I just
couldn't remember so I decided to tell
you guys what my favorite duochrome
shadows are I have three to show you
here and then I'll have my bonus shades
but I feel like you should pick whatever
you
the most so if you like a duochrome
shadow that you know shifts pink then
pick something up like that this right
here is makeup geeks prism this is a
pressed foiled duo krump shadow from
them which they do not have I was lucky
enough to pick this up at Fame Expo when
they were just like debuting um but you
can pick this up and loose form on the
makeup geek website they also have the
color sugar rush which I think would be
really pretty too so it's just like a
light dual chrome that shifts a blood
color another this one happens to shift
pink and orange another one for makeup
geek but you can't purchase this one
this is phantom and this is a light
shade that shifts purple I think that
one is just stunning again I'll have
close-up so really love this shadow and
then a newer one to my collection is
from luck see beauty and this is lime
light I've been absolutely obsessed with
the shadow not only as a glint shade and
eyeshadow but as a face highlight it's
so pretty I don't know what it is about
this color I'm obsessed with that though
I love it with a pink and I really like
warm brown and then putting this on the
inner corner it's so pretty and then
like accenting my face with that too I'm
obsessed so this is one I highly
recommend now here's a little overview
of the palette I feel like I did a
really good job of duping this I
definitely feel like looking at these
shadows I have no desire to get the
Tarte one I think that these will
perform just as nice for me and I'm
excited to use them so another thing
with this palette that I feel like it
was a missed opportunity in a way I
talked about this in my new Beauty
lunches I'll leave it link down below
but I just feel like this palette it's
this whole unicorn themed it's supposed
to be like make believe in yourself and
I just didn't I didn't feel like they
went far enough I wanted to see more duo
crumbs I wanted to see a more array of
colors this honestly is a neutral
palette with a couple pops of color when
you really look at it and I especially
realized that as I was trying to dupe it
so I just wish they had some pinks in
there which had some more purples I wish
they had the blues and the greens and
maybe made it a little bit more rainbow
it could be more subdued it doesn't have
to be like you know hot pink or electric
green but just having a little bit more
something you
so for me that was just a missed
opportunity so for my bonus shades
they're gonna reflect kind of more of
what I wish I saw the first one I want
to mention though is actually the
highlighter palette from Kat Von D this
is the alchemists palette and this is
such a beautiful palette these basically
look like eyeshadows because the pans
are so small I really like these and I
think these would work really well as
dupes for the center shade and really I
feel like this is more make believe in
yourself than that palette is so if you
have this palette already I feel like
you can you don't need the duochrome
shade in the middle and if you could
find a couple other shades from the
outside that you can hopefully do you
should be able to put the palette
together
and then here are some white bonus
shades like even looking at this to me
this looks more like Oh fun what does
that make believe in yourself I don't
know how I just feel like these are a
better selection so the first one here a
lot of these are actually from look see
Beauty this is the color aura and this
has a shift to it like I've mentioned
before with luck see stuff you
definitely need a base for it it looks
really pretty in a swatch but if you're
gonna build it up on the eye I highly
suggest using a sticky base and also
foiling them but this is so pretty it's
almost like a neutral shadow but then it
has a gold orange pink shift to it I
just thought that could kind of replace
some of those more neutral shades like
it's a neutral but not so much next is
something that was also mentioned in my
last let's stupid video this is slither
by luck see Beauty something that I
really like about the luck see Beauty
like duochrome shades is that all of
their eyeshadows are $5 so even these
more metallic ones are still at that
price range whereas they makeup geek go
up to $10 so if you're looking to maybe
save a little bit of money you can
definitely do that again you just have
to finesse these a little bit more than
the makeup geek ones but I still like
them I've been enjoying them a lot I
will hopefully have my luck see Beauty
like I shot a video up at some point in
the next two weeks next for a bonus
shadow this is the color Aquarius from
Alexi Beauty this is such a pretty teal
color and
has a shift of gold to it he's just hit
the light so pretty and I think that's
what I like about him the most it almost
in some light it just looks okay and
then other lights it's like boom it
flashes it's so pretty so I I just think
this one would have been a little bit
more fun in the palette too next I have
two shades that are actually dupes of
each other and they don't do anything in
the palette but I think that they'd be
really pretty and one of them is makeup
geeks blacklight and the other one is
look see beauty's duper star really
really pretty colors if you want another
one
Urban Decay's tonic is also the same
color as these these are like a blue a
purple shift there they are I swatch
both of them they look exactly the same
because they're basically the same
eyeshadow out of these I prefer the
makeup geek formula so if you're gonna
spend the money just spend the dollar
more and get the makeup geek but I still
think that the look see Beauty is nice
another makeup geek shadow this is
another one of the foiled and this is
the color daydreamer I'm surprised I'm
really pretty like lavender purple
wasn't on like the list and wasn't in
the palette it's kind of hard to see
it's a really beautiful color though
highly suggest this one just in general
but I feel like it would be a nice
addition to this palette I only have
three more guys just three more these
last three are all from luck see Beauty
this is the color Noir this is a really
pretty blue shade and it has almost like
a periwinkle to it as well I just think
that this could be nice and for your
looking for it like those really pretty
blue shades that are in the palette this
is a nice one again it's only five
dollars and I think it's just beautiful
I really like this color this is one
that I have on my inner corner today
this is star boy from Luxy Beauty this
is definitely chunky so go in knowing
this is going to be chunky but the
metallic on this is just pretty insane
like it's pretty crazy how metallic this
shows up I definitely suggest using a
sticky base and foiling this as much as
you can I have it on my inner corner it
has a little bit of fallout but I
definitely think that this is one of
those glittery shimmery shades that's
worth the finessing and if you can get
it to like stick where you want it it's
really really beautiful so I
I do suggest this I do think it's pretty
if you like a shadow like this I thought
I'd be pretty do like a halo eye with
that palette and that being on the
center of the lid it'd be really pretty
and last is the color foxy lady from
luck see beauty this is a like lavender
with a gold ship and I don't know I just
felt like this was also in the spirit of
the palette with it being you know
duochrome but still kind of subdued I
feel like a lot of the colors that were
in this palette the Tarte one were
colorful but a bit subdued there was
something about it that had a little bit
of grey or you know just something that
didn't make it all the way so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I hope this
helps you either look in your collection
to find dupes or I don't know maybe
maybe shows you here you don't need it I
don't I don't think it's a must-have
palette so that's everything guys thanks
so much for watching I will see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
