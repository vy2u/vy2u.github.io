Lauren I have decided that I want to
start trying to do palates that come out
that I'm kind of like wanting but I know
I shouldn't get because I have really
similar colors I did a video similar to
this before with the peach palette I
will link that down below if you want to
check it out I also recently did this
with the lorac I love brunch palette
although I did buy that one and then
return it so ultimately though this is a
way for me to shop my stash and find
shadows in my collection that are
similar enough for me to get the looks
that I would create with the colors of a
palette that I'm wanting I'm talking
about the Too Faced peanut butter and
honey palette in this video specifically
it's funny because when I first saw the
picture of that palette I was not
interested I I was very disappointed and
the more I look at it the more I frickin
want it which is like sick I'm like no
so I thought I would scavenge through my
collection and pick some colors that I
thought were really similar just to put
a disclaimer out there and so people
don't get this twisted I obviously don't
have that palette so these are not going
to be exact dupes I dupe this to the
best of my ability looking at pictures
online and taking into consideration the
inspiration and the spirit of the
palette also with this palette I only
chose single shadows so you can buy all
of these individually you don't have to
buy a palette I'm gonna have some bonus
shades at the end that are similar if
you want to know about those I'm also
having a demo for this I look at the end
of the video so if you bought this
palette good for you I hope you love it
and it looks really pretty I kind of
want it too but I'm trying to be good
and not like the packaging and all the
hype get to me and instead reach for
some things in my collection that are
gonna be just as pretty and do me just
as good so I have my 9 shades here
they're so pretty
first off the bat you can tell that
these shades are gonna be a little bit
different than what you see in the
palette honestly to me these three like
lighter shades on the side are just they
don't mean anything to me I don't feel
like there's anything special about them
so I just put in what I would want to /
what kind of matched it so I feel like
you can take whatever liberties you want
with that row because it's just like a
throwaway road to me I'm just saying how
I feel
the first one in the upper corner is max
vanilla this is their press shadow and
this is basically a matte but it has a
little bit of a shimmer in it it's
really nice it translates as a matte for
me I use a color like this to set my
primer so that I can blend on top of my
primer with other shadows and it works
really nice
the next shadow I have here is Mac's
shroom and this is just a shimmering
iridescent shade you could basically
fill this in with any of your favorite
light shimmery shades that you're gonna
use to be a highlight or even on the lid
or whatever this is just the one that I
chose for this palette and that I felt
like matched but this isn't like a shade
that I think is amazing or anything I
just felt like it matched nice and you
know I could get good use out of it in
cohesion with this palette and the last
one here this is the one that I probably
took the most liberties with it's the
most different but this is Peach
Smoothie I just thought that since I was
making my own palette I would put
something in there that I would actually
use more than just another similar shade
to these two for me this works as a bit
of a transition it's really light and I
feel like it goes well with the rest of
the palette so that one's kind of like
my own little thing but I personally
feel like I would like it better than if
I actually had that palette the next
room is probably what is most exciting
about this palette the first shade here
is a dupe for peanut butter that's the
entire inspiration for this palette I'm
not gonna lie I'm a little disappointed
that peanut butters in this palette
because why do we have peanut butter
again we have the peanut butter and
jelly palette and also peanut butters
and the chocolate bar palette doesn't
make any sense
this shade right here is a Mac and it is
a color from Coastal Scents
it's m07 I will have the actual name
listed below I got this before they
actually named their shadows it's a nice
warm brown matte mid-tone color so I
feel like it works really nicely it
works in conjunction with the other
shadows the next two shadows are the
ones for me that make me want to have
this palettes I'm excited to have two
shadows that I really feel like capture
the spirit of the palette so this is
from Coastal Scents as well this is
bittersweet orange it's a really pretty
like almost terracotta color this might
be a little bit darker a little bit more
pink than the one in the palette but I
think it's absolutely beautiful I think
it mimics what I would do with that
color this how
a bit of a shimmer but in my bonus
shadows I do have something that's
similar a little bit lighter if you want
to go for that so I really like that one
next is cantaloupe slice from Coastal
Scents this is a matte and it is a
mustard yellow ah I love it it's so
pretty I really feel like it's very
similar to the color in the palette and
I really like it obviously I'm using it
today up here and I've really been
liking yellows like this for a while now
I just think they're really pretty so I
think it's really cool that they came
out with that and I think it's really
cool that I have something similar to it
already in my collection okay and now we
have the last row these are gonna be a
little bit deeper a little bit darker
the top one here is Mac's antiqued and
this is a really pretty warm almost like
a ready Brown I think it's really nice
and I honestly feel like it's gonna be a
little bit better than the one in the
palette I know two-phase tends to like
just throw in some sparkle every now and
then and I think this one probably has a
little bit of a better formula for me
the next one is a matte and this is
Oktoberfest this is probably the most
different that I'm actually trying to do
such a pretty color I feel like this is
probably similar to cocoa bear by makeup
geek so pretty I think this is really
nice it goes really well with this
palette the other one does have some
sparkle to it it's not a matte but I
kind of like the matte better and the
last shade here this is makeup geeks
tiki hut and this is more of a yellow
brown instead of a orange brown another
nice like a little past mid-tone brown
to give a little bit of definition
overall nothing in that palette has like
a really deep and dark color which is
something that I actually like because I
am so fair I don't need something really
dark it just hits all the marks and it
definitely looks like the palette to me
let me know what you guys think down
below if you think this is similar
enough don't be mean to me if you don't
think it's similar but I feel like for
what I have in my collection I
I feel like I did a really good job and
I'm excited to use this and I'm going to
try not to watch anyone's videos on that
palette because I don't want to get
sucked in the peanut butter and honey
palette I'll leave it linked down below
if you want to check it out but it
retails for $36 and I basically have
that right here in single shadows that
were in my collection so since my
collection is so big
I feel like I do have a lot of shades
out there and I feel like this series is
gonna be really great for me to explore
my own collection and I've talked about
this before but what really gets me on a
pallet is the inspiration if the color
combination is a little bit different
that's exciting to me so I think it's
fun to move around my single shadows in
my different palettes and create and try
to simulate these palettes that are
inspiring me and make those looks at
home so so I have some other colors in
this palette along with a bronzer that I
feel like are in the same spirit of the
palette but maybe didn't match really
close in tone but I think would be great
if you had these you're gonna get
similar looks and can be inspired in a
similar way if you're looking for more
of those almost like pinky terracotta
brownie colors this is Tuscany from
Coastal Scents this is a matte color and
it is very very beautiful another one
from Coastal Scents is petal peach and
this one is a little bit lighter it's
not as Brown it's a little bit more
peach in it really pretty for yellows I
have a couple different colors in here
another one from Coastal Scents this is
orange mousse I have a lot of Coastal
Scents shadows if you can't tell this
one is definitely more like yellow if
you want something less mustardy and
more like yellow this is the one for you
it's Matt this is chickadee from makeup
geek I feel like this is kind of a mix
of some colors in that palette it's
yellow and orange and kind of brown all
in one really really pretty and
interesting I feel like that one's a
little bit more wearable than the yellow
in the palette if you're wanting
something that is gonna be easier to use
but a similar look and then my last two
are some like yellow toned Browns the
first one I have here is paper tiger
from colour-pop they just release their
powder shadows and I feel like this one
is very much on trend with that color
scheme in the palette and the last color
I have in my bonus picks this is desert
sands and this is another one of those
like yellow brown type of colors and
that's it there on the bottom definitely
the darkest out of everything but still
quite light nothing like too too dark
and last real quick I did want to bring
out the peanut butter and jelly palette
because I feel like peanut butter and
nuts about you are colors that are very
similar to colors in that palette so if
you already have this I feel like you
already have essentially
even peanut brittle is really similar in
that vein so you have like three colors
very similar and maybe you only need to
get like a yellow if that's really what
you're looking for
other than the yellow and I feel like
that middle shade there they are colors
that are you can do it's just finding
them and putting them together so you
can be inspired in the same way I think
that's everything I have to say about
the palette we are gonna get into the
demo now if you want to see how I did
this I look stay tuned
I used the colors in my like official
dupe palette and you can see how I use
these to get this look alright I'll see
you there okay guys I thought I would do
a little bit of a demo using my
self-made Too Faced peanut butter and
honey palette although mine is slightly
different than the actual I thought it
would be fun just to show you guys what
I would do with the colors that are
subbing for those colors and it would
hopefully give you some inspiration if
you own that palette on what you can
maybe do with it so as always I'm gonna
set my primer so I'm gonna be using Mac
vanilla that's what I have in here and
this is just gonna give us a smooth
canvas to blend on top of next I'm gonna
go in with this shade here I would
normally go in with something maybe a
little bit lighter this is peach
smoothie from makeup geek but since this
is kind of my own made-up one for the
palette I'm gonna go in with this color
here which is substituting for peanut
butter and I'm going to put that into my
crease and start transitioning I'm going
to be focusing on using the yellows and
this kind of like ready color I feel
like that's what's really exciting about
the palette and I feel like a lot of
people maybe won't know what to do with
the yellow color because it is kind of a
weird one but yellows can be so pretty
so I have another tutorial where I use
yellow and I'm gonna leave that link
down below so you guys can check that
out as well I wear like blue lips it's
kind of a grungy look I feel like I have
similar colors in that tutorial already
so if you want more inspiration I'm
realizing I might even do a really
similar look to that we'll see I think
peanut butter might be a little bit more
pigmented than this one so just go in
lighter with it take your time and build
it up if you want it to be more of a
transition now that we have that on I'm
gonna
with the middle shade here and I'm going
to be packing this all over the lid I
think this is a really pretty color and
I really want to focus on it I'm just
putting that all over my eyelid this
might be a little bit more pink than the
color in the two-phase um it's showing
up kind of pinky red but I feel like
it's similar enough if anything this one
might be more interesting I'm gonna
blend that color out using just a tiny
bit more of the original color we had in
our transition now to give this look a
little bit more definition I'm gonna go
in with this color here this is
Oktoberfest from coastal zones and I'm
just going to be putting that on the
outer corner and just blending that and
once again we're just gonna blend out
some of those edges and I'm just gonna
reap put the middle shade on our lid
just to make sure but that's still nice
and intense now that we're here I'm
gonna go with the yellow this is
cantaloupe slice from Coastal Scents and
I'm gonna be putting this in my classic
area the inner portion of the brow I
really like the way yellows look here I
don't know I just think it looks really
cool it's like unexpected but still
neutral it's not as bright as like the
pink would be if you didn't want to do
this you could use this as your blending
out shade and that would look really
good as well I guess this isn't wearable
for a lot of you guys I'm sorry I think
it just looks so pretty I think this
color combination is really pretty I'm
gonna put a little bit more of vanilla
on my brow bone just to hopefully just
keep it bright I like the brow bone to
look lifted I'm gonna go in with some
products you guys know really well this
is my bronze bonanza liner from pop UD
and this is my steal white liner you can
use any white liner I'm going to use
this to tight line and up around a
little bit on my lower lash line and
I'll put this in my waterline with a
look like this where you are using
warmer tones especially that Center
color in the palette I really think the
white helps keep your eyes looking
bright and everything looking on purpose
instead of sickly so I just highly
suggest that I'm gonna go in and just
kind of rub any powder I might have away
I suggest doing her eye makeup first if
you feel like your products are gonna
fall out on you I didn't have too much
fallout or anything but
I guess you would hate to like lose all
your awesome work so the first thing I'm
gonna do this is the elf eyeshadow brush
it's like a dollar brush and I like
using this on the lower lash line to
kind of buff out color so I'm going back
in with cantaloupe slice and I'm going
to run that on underneath the eye and
kind of blow it out a little bit it's
gonna tie in this color I really like
having my accent color positioned on the
lower lash line somehow I don't always
do it with my pink because I don't want
the pink to over take a look now I'm
gonna go in closest to the lash line
with a little bit of antiqued from Mac
this is gonna go really close to the
lash line as our definition and then I
am gonna even put a little bit of
Oktoberfest in between those two colors
just just no good a little bit more last
for this look and eyeshadows I'm gonna
go into with shroom and I'm gonna put
that on the inner corner to highlight it
I would probably most of the time use
something even more bright but if I'm
trying to stick to what I put in this
palette oh it looks good never mind and
now I'm just gonna put some mascara on
okay guys and that is the final look I
hope you guys enjoyed I hope this gives
you some inspiration this is just what I
would do probably my first look if I had
that palette if you're a little scared
of the yellow I definitely suggest using
it as a transition or just like on the
very outer portion of a crease to really
give it some warmth and a little bit of
something different that's a really easy
way to incorporate it without it looking
like yellow but yeah I hope you guys
enjoy it I hope you're having a
wonderful day thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
