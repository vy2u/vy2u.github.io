Lauren thank you so much for watching we
are doing another lip stupid video today
I know it's been a while since I've done
one of these so sorry but we are back I
leave the playlist link down below if
you want to check out other palettes
that I do this series is all about
taking palettes and duping them with
single shadows that you can buy
individually and hopefully it will
inspire you to look within your own
collection and really see if a palette
is something that you actually need or
something that's actually different to
your collection we're all makeup lovers
you can buy whatever you want and if
it's something you really like even if
you have those colors I totally get it
but with so many things launching
sometimes it's just too much like I
remember before I used to be able to get
all the new palettes because it wasn't
quite as often as it is now and now with
so many new brands and so many releases
unless you're rich you can't get
everything so hopefully this will help
inspire you to just use what you have
and really buy the things that you just
have to have that really are actually
great purchases for you that being said
these gifts are not exactly I do not own
this palette I am going off of pictures
I am also taking inspiration I say this
in all my videos but I really like to
look at the spirit of a palette what
they're going for what's the inspiration
and picking shadows in my collection
that are as close to the picture and if
I don't have something that's super
similar then that stays with the spirit
of the palette so this is my take on the
Urban Decay Naked heat palette if you
guys follow me on instagram you saw me
and I did post some swatches there of
this palette just to kind of show you
guys I was working on this I'm really
happy with this palette I also did my
eyelid today using this there will be a
general at the end of the video other
than that I don't really want to talk
about about the actual Urban Decay Naked
Heat I don't have it it's not personally
something that I'm going to buy I just
got rid of my other nature Palace and
although this one is definitely the most
beautiful and I feel like on trend and
it has the most maps I definitely feel
like it's the best one out of all of
them I just don't feel like I need to
spend $54 on those shadows when I have
so many warm tones already in my
collection that's all I will say about
that so let's just get into my my color
dupes and swatches the first color half
of the palette is Mac's vanilla now this
isn't a
I let's give it videos and that's
because it's one of my only light matte
cream shades that I have in single pan
form I'm not necessarily saying you have
to have this shadow but any matte cream
shade that is like a little bit lighter
than your skin tone or your skin tone is
going to work for this palette matte
cream shades are not unique to palette I
think that every palette should have it
but I feel like you can easily do these
colors so any color you have a similar
to this would totally work but I'm glad
it's in the palette I would put this in
every single one of my palettes because
I need a matte cream shade next I have a
shadow from luck see Beauty this is the
color sorbet and this is a very
beautiful white peachy transition color
I love shades like this I love anasazi
with orange soda which is very similar
also makeup geek Peach Smoothie anything
in that vein is going to give you this
look I think this is a great transition
that fits with the rest of the colors in
the palette and I really do like the
shade I use this one in my look today
the next color I have for my palette is
makeup use creme brulee now this shade
in the palette was a nice transition as
well
I felt like although this is a very warm
tone palette that this shade itself
wasn't crazy warm it was kind of this
like neutral leaning warm so I really
liked this paired with the palette it
just kind of gave you some more options
I felt like then just going super warm I
really love the shadow as you can tell
if it pan on it
make a geek shadows are very nice
they're super soft super buttery and
they blend so well honestly again even
though I am personally not buying the
palette I really do think that this
palette is nice and for the palette I
created I really do like the
configuration that I tried to follow
with there's I think they did a great
job so next I have a shadow from
colour-pop this is part of their limited
edition at the summer collection so if
you really want the shadow I suggest you
get it just in case it does go out of
stock and you can't get it later anyway
this is the color see stars is a matte
Brown this is just a bit deeper than the
creme brulee shadow such a nice color
really loved this as well again these
are all just nice brown shades so I'm
into it I really like warm brown shades
as does everyone right now next is one
of my favorite colors that I put in this
palette this is from colour-pop 2 and
this is the color high-strung I believe
this is part of a
regular range it's just a beautiful
shadow I questioned picking this one up
because I was like do I really need it
am I going to use it I think it has an
amazing formula if you will super soft
and creamy I do suggest them I really
like the color pop single shadows I will
continue to repurchase them I honestly
feel like I'll probably purchase them
over the super shock ones I don't even
think I'm going to mess around with them
anymore because they just they got it
going on with these powder ones highly
suggest this one of my favorite shades
in the palette I created and right now I
think their shadows are on sale 20% off
so they're all $4 so just saying the
next shade in the palette is probably
the most orange toned out of anything so
I decided to go with the color maple
from look see this is a matte shade it's
definitely still brown but it has that
warm red orange undertone to it
SuperDuper pretty I definitely think
that this gives that pop of like really
bright warmth to the palette that's the
original palette actually have if you
guys want an overall review of look see
I will leave that video link down below
too just so you guys can kind of know
what look see beauty is all about kind
of like my ideas on their formula I do
really like them but I definitely think
it's a good video to check out before
you purchase if you were going to
purchase anything we are now onto the
second part of this palette now I feel
like this is where my palette differs
the most from the originals
keep that in mind that this one is a
little bit more inspired by in the
spirit of as opposed to exact dupes I
just didn't have colors that were exact
and honestly the one kind of problem I
had with the Naked heat is I feel like
so many of the colors are so similar I
think that's something that's really
important when making a palette is that
colors go together and maybe are in a
very same tone but if they're too
similar they just kind of look like the
same shadow on the eye there isn't
enough of a difference to warrant that
many colors so I kind of like did my own
thing at this point
so next for my palette I have
flamethrower by makeup geek I really
like to make a geek foiled shadows they
just perform so nice they're so shiny so
buttery I really like that this is a
nice orange shade to the palette and I
feel like it would work with so many of
the other colors in this palette
next I decided to put in a kind of red
shimmer this is a red stone from Coastal
Scents
this isn't like foiled by any means but
it does have a nice Sheen to it it also
has a kind of almost pink flash it's not
dual chrome but it just has something a
little bit different it would also just
complement so many of the other colors
in this palette and really besides
another color at the end these are all
of these shimmers that I really put in
this palette I wanted to keep the whole
matte idea going I just love math I feel
like most people enjoy math and I feel
like these three shimmers are different
enough that you could get a lot of
different looks next we have another
look see Beauty shadow this is the color
Faro and it's just a nice warm orange e
Brown it's not quite as dark as maple it
doesn't have as much red as maple this
is a great mid-tone warm Brown for this
palette and that compared to C stars if
you'll excuse ours has more Brown and
more of like a yellow brown instead of
orange E Brown next is one of the colors
that I think is so pretty it's what I'm
using on the outer corner today this is
going steady from colour-pop it's a
matte purpley color there is a kind of
like red and dark purple in the palette
and I just don't have exact colors for
that so I decided to take liberties and
just kind of make it what I wanted I
feel like this color combined with maple
is what makes this palette kind of
almost lean in between naked heat and
the Queen of Hearts palette my coloured
raine someone mentioned that on my
Instagram and I totally can see that as
well I think this is such a pretty color
I feel like shades like this that are
kind of dark and colorful but they still
have this brightness to them are so
pretty on the eye they add a pop of
color without it being too crazy and too
scary I highly suggest the shadow from
colour-pop really really love it next is
the darkest color in the palette and for
my shade I decided to go with make a few
cherry cola this is a kind of brown red
toned color now this isn't as dark as
you would think it is in the pan but I
think it's really nice to complement
this palette if you are someone with
darker skin I would go even a step bit
darker to have even more depth for you
but I do really like this one I think
again because it's not just a straight
brown it really complements the palette
it complements the other colors and I do
really enjoy this shadow from
and last this is one of my favorite
genres that I have in my collection this
is antiqued from Mac it just looks like
a bronze but there's something about
this bronze it's beautiful I love using
this in my outer corner you guys know
that it really brings out the blue in my
eyes has this like red undertone again I
feel like it would work so well with all
of the colors in the palette but it kind
of brings a little bit of a more neutral
twist to this so that is like my
official like it's dupe for dupe I feel
like if you line these up all in a row
they would do papel it quite well except
for flamethrower and going steady from
colour-pop if you like those ones are
the most different but I do have some
bonus shadows that I want to talk about
I always do this these are shadows that
I feel like aren't necessarily dupes but
I feel like really go well with the
palette honestly I could pick bonus
shadows for days on this if it's a warm
tone brown orange red like so many
shadows could be inspired and are
similar to this palette so I really
tried to just narrow it down to the best
couple how many don't have here I picked
eight so it's still a lot but let me get
into those and then we'll move on to the
demo first off I wanted to bring up
makeup geeks desert sands this is
something that was really popular when
it came out I do really like this shadow
but this definitely differs from the
palette as in its warm tone but it has
that yellow undertone to it it's not
orange really really pretty that is
there I really enjoy the shadow again
this might be something you already have
in your collection though I'm going to
keep to kind of as more yellow tones
this one is pumpkin spice wife from look
see beauty something very similar to
this with the makeup geeks chickadee
these are really pretty and I feel like
it would again complement the palette
really really well
there aren't any like yellow shades in
this palette but I think that they look
really nice with it and would look
really good and last we're kind of more
those warm yellows I have beach blanket
again from color pops 2017 summer
collection this is lighter so this would
be more of like a great transition color
I really really like it as well super
pretty and it's a matte shade I have a
couple shimmers that I thought would be
nice in this palette the first one here
is mythology from Mac now I'm not saying
this is the best formula because this
one does seem a little bit like almost
flaky this would definitely benefit from
using a foiled method
using like mac fix+ or something like
that but i felt like it was really
pretty it'd be a great little topper or
something to halo the eye ways and if
you already have this in your collection
you can definitely bring it back out and
you know incorporate it into some of
these other colors and get a really
pretty look with Jesse right now it is
very hard to continuously try to talk
about these shadows and like not say the
same thing every single time so if I
repeat myself you know I apologize but
it's difficult
the only other shimmer that I picked out
is from colour-pop in Cincy color pinkie
promise it's a red purple color so so
pretty I love the color pop shadows and
I think this would look really nice at
the palette I also thought a more orange
shadow would be really awesome with the
palette this is cannonball from
colour-pop this is a part of the summer
collection as well everything will be
linked down below though if you really
want it really really pretty I use this
on my lower lash line today this one is
a bit powdery but I feel like it
performs really nice it's super
pigmented again it's matte really really
like this and that just gives it a
little bit more color so it's not as
it's not as naked as the original and
last I have two colors from Coastal
Scents this one here is n25 I don't know
what that is in real time but this is
just another dark purple shade it's
matte very similar to going steady from
colour-pop but not as bright and the
last one is no stranger to little lots
of dupit series this is Oktoberfest from
Coastal Scents this is one of their like
best-selling shadows it's such a
beautiful warm brown color I feel like
this is probably very similar to cocoa
bear from makeup geek or raw Sienna from
honest hacia there is a swatch of it at
the bottom really beautiful this easily
could be a part of the palette so pretty
like even just all these colors on my
hand are so beautiful so that is
everything for the swatches and shadows
if you want to see how I got this look
that I'm wearing throughout this video
and just keep watching the demo will be
starting now so let's get into the demo
portion of this I don't know what kind
of look I want to do today I think I
want to do something with these two
colors and the orange and maybe this on
my lid not sure we'll see I have already
primed my eyes so I'm going to go in and
just kind of make sure everything's
with this matte shade it's just like a
creamy matte shade next just to get a
transition I'm going to go in with this
color here this is sorbet by look so you
could also use orange soda by anastasiya
peach smoothie by makeup geek any of
those type of colors and I'm just going
to run that in the crease gently next
I'm going to go in with a bit of a
smaller blending brush I'm going to take
this shade here I believe it's a maple
let's see yes the color maple and I'm
going to be putting that in my crease
but more on the inside here that's what
I'm going to be focusing at the most
just going to deepen it up you're not
bringing it necessarily up into the
brows I'm just putting it on this inside
portion and I'm going to bring a little
bit of that also on the outer portion
next I'm going to be going in with our
lid shade and this is the color
high-strung from colour-pop such a
beautiful color and really happy I
picked this one up it's a really pretty
rose gold but it's not too gold
it's just kind of rosy I don't know I
really like it and I'm just going to be
putting this all over the lid I'm going
to go back in with that blending brush
and take a little bit of sorbet
potentially some of maple and just make
sure it's nice and blended in this front
portion next for the outer portion of
the I'm going to be taking this color
here also from colour-pop this is the
color growing study I'm so good I'm like
memorizing his name and I'm going to be
putting this into the outer portion of
the eye just to bring in some color now
this is probably the most different
color from the actual palette so it
might not be this bright if you're
recreating this look actually with that
palette but this is like the part that I
personally like about my palette as
opposed to the Urban Decay one someone
mentioned in my Instagram post because I
did post a picture of my swatches there
before I uploaded the video so if you
want to check out mentor and check it
out
they said that my palette looks like the
color drain Queen of Hearts which I
definitely can see that so if you have
that palette you could also do something
very similar to this look okay I'm
really liking the way that looks I'm
going to go back in with maple and just
kind of on the outer edges of that
purple blend out with that Laundry red I
feel like I always like the way this bad
ones
and the size of the dirt out sister and
then just to go on the outer edges I'm
going to take more sorbet and just kind
of round it out and make sure
everything's as limited as possible and
to intensify the color on the lid I'm
just going to put it on my fingers and
Pat it all of my finger I'm also going
to bring the red in and the orange a
little bit more into this inner portion
and blend it out the sorbet I'm going to
go in and just clean up any fallout
which I actually don't really have any
surprisingly for the lower lash line I
really do want to keep that kind of like
orange color going I'm actually going to
go in with a color that's one of my
bonus shades this right here is the
color cannonball from colour-pop I'm
going to be running that on my lower
lashline pretty intense
I'm still trying to keep it on like
mostly the outer portion not too far in
but I do want it to be kind of blown out
I'm sorry about that noise and then to
blend that color out I'm going to take
sorbet on a fluffier brush and just kind
of make sure the edges are nice and I
think I'm going to bring some of the
going study just on this portion right
here just to kind of meld that a little
better with the upper lid I don't feel
like that palate as it stands really has
an inner corner highlight for me unless
you want to do something matte so I'm
going to be going into a whole different
palette you can use whatever you want
I'm sorry but this is just what I was
feeling with this look we're going to
put this yellow shade here from this
color pop palette on my inner corner I
thought it'd be nice kind of because
it's still warm I don't know I've really
been liking yellow on the inner corner
lately I'll probably be doing another
look using this palette tomorrow and
I'll probably do some things in the
winter oh yeah I just feel like this
kind of finishes the look a little so I
did put some liners on for tightlining I
put the laura geller incredible
waterproof gel eyeliner in brown sugar
on the top and then in my waterline I
did put a white cran from Stila for
mascara today I'm going to be using the
Eden minerals mascara this is their
volumizing one and it's quite black so I
do really like it and here is the final
look guys I really hope you enjoyed this
demo portion at the end I'm really going
to be trying to include demo portions
because I know that that is just
something extra that you guys like
seeing in these videos overall I'm
really happy with how these shadows look
and perform together I really like this
I love in camera it's not really showing
the yellow as true as it is here I know
I didn't put like a yellow in this
palette but if you have yell at home you
could always do that or something else
anyway that's everything for this video
if you have any suggestions for palettes
you'd like me to do definitely leave
them down below and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
