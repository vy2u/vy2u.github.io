learn thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my third video in my
let's stupid series I decided to stay
with the two-face trend and we are going
to be duping the two-face peanut butter
and jelly palette I had a specific
request in the comments to do this
palette so since I had it I thought
let's try to dupe it let's try to dupe
it this is one of my favorite palettes
I'm really happy with it
I just think it's a great palette you
can tell I have some dips in here
because I do like it and use it but I
thought it'd be a fun challenge to try
to do before you guys that way if you
just wanted one color so you could just
pick up one this is my dupe palette if
you guys haven't watched one of these
videos before I will leave my playlist
linked down below but my goal in this
series is to do palettes to the best of
my ability with single shadows that I
already own in my collection if you guys
want to purchase any you can just pick
out the ones you want or all of them it
just depends on my ear want to do
another reason I like picking the
individual shadows in the pan form is
that I can actually like move them
around to actually create the palette so
you can see all the colors together as
they would be in the original palette
and to me that's a big deal because I've
talked about inspiration a lot when it
comes to palettes but having colors and
a certain combination is what really is
inspiring so that being said the dupes
aren't always a hundred percent but
they're the closest I can get with what
I have in my collection and I really do
try to keep the spirit and the intention
of the palette at heart when I'm picking
dupes
so I'm not gonna be doing a demo with
these palettes but I am gonna be showing
you comparison swatches of everything so
let me know what you want to see me do
pin X in the comments down below I think
I'm gonna do the Kylie Royal Peach
palette someone requested that in the
last video as well so that one seems
like it's gonna be kind of hard but
it'll be close so we'll see that one is
going to be a challenge any suggestions
please leave them down below
that's everything guys let's get into
swatches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
