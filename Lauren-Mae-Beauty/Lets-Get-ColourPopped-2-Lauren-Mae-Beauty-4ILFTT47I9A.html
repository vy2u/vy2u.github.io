learned thank you so much for watching
this is going to be a let's get coloured
pop get ready opening tutorial I don't
know what you want to call it the series
came along because I wanted to get more
use out of my color pop items especially
the super shock shadows that are kind of
that like creamy bouncy texture I think
they're really pretty they swatch
beautifully but I tend to never reach
for them so I wanted a place where we
can all be inspired to reach for those
items I'm going for a more dramatic look
today I'm going to do something a little
bit smoky on the eye so I will be doing
them first and I'm also going to be
doing like a darker lip even with a
darker eye so that will be fun I'm
excited for that
before we get into it I just wanted to
mention my new glasses I just got these
from Vermeil and you guys have heard me
talk about for a million times I wanted
to show you them they're super duper
cute they have gold accents and then the
frames themselves are clear I think
they're really fun I really do like them
I will leave any information I have
about fur move down below I'm also going
to link the other videos I've done
talking about them because I'm not going
to like waste our time we already know I
love it a lot of you guys have tried it
out and loved it too so yeah they're
super duper cute if you follow me on
instagram you guys see my glasses all
the time because you know I can't see
without them so yeah love you know you
guys think of these glasses compared to
my other ones but I wanted just to give
you a quick little glance at them
SuperDuper cute I'm going to zoom us in
so we can get started on the eyes we're
actually going to be like closer up
we'll see how that goes the first thing
I'm going to do is just prime my eyelids
amazing felt Milani
retouch concealer I'm just using a
concealer today because one I don't have
anything on my face and usually this
area would already be like cancelled out
with my foundation and concealer and I'm
not really worried about them creasing
or anything I don't know why I probably
should do this I'm not and then to set
that I'm going to be going in with this
light shade here from colour-pop in the
yes play palette just making sure I have
a nice non sticky base to blend on top
of I'm going to be using a mix of powder
eyeshadows as well as the super soft
ones today I figured it's time since its
color pop I mostly just try and use
color pop as much as I can in this
tutorial so first I'm going to go in
with this color here this is Beach
Blanket it's very very warm I know it
looks warm but it translates just as
warm on the eye and I want to
just to be in the crease that's pretty
good Linton and this is going to be kind
of the top layer although everything's
going to be soapy I want a little bit of
warmth just peeking out and I forgot
something that's really important to me
our brows when I'm like trying to
construct my eye looks because it just
gives me points of reference so I'm
going to go in and do my eyebrows really
fast I'm going to be using as a brow
pencil from colour-pop this is in taupe
taupe and then I will also be going in
with just some powder in the front so
they're not too harsh in this area I
just plucked my eyebrows so I'm like
breaking out its without fail I will
break out if I pluck my eyebrows but I
also don't want little golden hair so to
trade off they look a little bit warm on
camera but they're not really as warm as
they're looking that just looks so much
better to me for figuring out where I'm
going to be placing with high shadows
next I'm going to be going into the
color Bellaire from colour-pop this one
here this one's just a little bit more
neutral and it's going to give us just a
better crease color to work with I'm
just going in with another fluffy brush
something a tiny bit smaller I just want
this one a little bit more concentrated
in just a few areas and not taken up
quite as high I hope that I look is
going to look good I kind of had some
ideas for yesterday and then I was
trying to lip on and was like yep that's
what I'm going to do so sometimes you
have this idea in your head of what
something's going to look like it
doesn't turn out that way hopefully this
one is done I'm going to move on to the
lid color we are using the super shock
shadow and 8-track and this is just a
kind of blackened gold it's really
really pretty and I don't know why but
I've just been wanting to use this so
I'm just going to put it on our finger
and spread it onto the lid I'm doing the
whole lid in this I think this would be
such a pretty like almost one shadow
kind of smokey eye one and done look and
now that I kind have that situation the
lid I'm going to take some on this brush
and just start blending and smoking it
into those other colors we've already
laid down and I think it's fine if some
of that glitter goes into the crease I
think it'll just add to this kind of
like almost what look that we're doing
and really make sure you get the inner
corner because we're going to do kind of
a halo eye when I add
powder shout out in the middle here it's
always so difficult for me when I do my
eyes first because I just feel like hell
ugly and then it like comes together
once you put foundation on but right now
I'm feeling like this is scary this is
not good the color I wanted to use kind
of as my halo within the yesplease
palette I'm going to be using that gold
shade it's really pretty really sparkly
and I am going to take that on a color
pops brush I guess they don't sell these
anymore but I don't know why they're so
good this one's just a flat shader I'm
also going to spray with some setting
spray so that way we can not have as
much fallout but it does have quite a
few like flaky glitters in it I'm just
putting these onto the middle of the eye
just to kind of highlight the highest
point of your eyelids now I'm going to
go back in with those transition colors
we used earlier the bel-air and Sam's
blankets each like it Beach Blanket and
I'm going to just be kind of blending
those into the crease and just making
sure everything looks nice and then
we're probably going to move on to
foundation I don't know if this is how I
want the eyelids to be done like
finished but I kind of want to see what
it looks like with everything else done
before I like to deepen it or anything
like that
my biggest goal for this is just to be
like a really just kind of sultry
looking smoky eye so I'm going to be
starting with my face I'm just going to
try to run through it as quick as
possible so for my primer and using the
coconut skin smoothie primer this is
just going to give me more of a dewy
based in a lot of my other primers and I
really kind of want to mimic this what
look that I'm trying to do on my eyes
and lips on my skin as well for
foundation I'm going to be using a
mixture of my Make Up For Ever HD and my
Eden minerals north skin I really like
the way this lifts the other day when I
use it and again I'll be using the eita
and mineral brush to stipple it on so
that I don't get too heavy of a coverage
even last time was more coverage than I
was intending originally so I'm going to
try to go a little bit less than even
that poor concealer again I'm going to
be going in with the Milani
erase and retouch retouch and Rayce
concealer I'm really just focusing this
under my
I want this to not only conceal but kind
of right in that area I'm going to put a
little in my nose pull it on my chin and
on any blemishes that didn't get quite
covered up I don't know why I have so
many little like spots right now but I
have a tough before I go into powder I'm
actually going to take a cream
highlighter this one is from Marc Jacobs
and it's in the color spotlight and I'm
just going to take my fingers and kind
of run some of this product on my
cheekbones I'm actually going to use my
Beauty Blender and just give myself kind
of that dewy or look I'm going back
timing here I just really want the do to
shine through now to set everything in
place I'm going to be going in with a
Sephora micro Simmons powder in light
and I'm using the elf blush brush and
I'm going to just be dusting that in my
chin down under the eyes and anywhere or
I feel like it just needs a little bit
of powder I mean the whole point as this
is more of a dewy look
but we're still adding highlighter later
so anything that kind of gets covered up
can definitely be fixed with the other
highlighter we review for bronzer I just
wanted to use my favorite so I'm using
the butter bronzer from Physicians
Formula I'm going to be taking that on
my pointed L brush from Real Techniques
and I'm just going to be lightly
bronzing up my skin this is going to
help with that kind of like glowy
sunkissed kind of look for Bushby I
wanted to keep it kind of like Rosie and
bronzy and I just got this in the mail
this is the kiss professional ombre
radiance palette and I wanted to use the
whole talent but this highlighter for
this look specifically is a little too
light cool toned and pink tones but I'm
going to kind of mix this blush shade in
the bronzer shade to create my blush
with very powdery something I did like
like about this is that the highlighter
is sharing and the blush is kind of set
and then the bronzer is matte so they
did a good job with the finishes of
these I feel like it
actually seems like it could be a
wearable situation because of that poor
highly today I wanted to think that was
really going to accentuate this golden
look we have going on so I'm going into
my Anasazi sweets palette and I'm going
to take the color marshmallow this has
quite a strong reflux of gold and I'm
going to just top off the other
highlighter we put on with this and I'm
going definitely way more hand than I
normally would as well and definitely
for real upon its face I'm going to now
be going back into my eyes and I want to
focus on making this outer portion and
the inner person just a little bit
darker so it looks not quite as messy as
it is so I'm just going to go in with
the original shade that we used and just
kind of deepen up this area so it looks
more spotlight on the lid I'm going to
add a little bit more of that pop of
gold on my finger onto my list and just
kind of Pat out the side and then I'm
going to go with another color pop
eyeshadow this is the super shock in
Farah and I'm going to be kind of adding
this to the outer and maybe even inner
corner to kind of deepen it up again I
think I'm going to stop messing with
that until we get on Lake liner and I'm
actually going to put some lashes on
today which is not a normal thing of
mine but I don't know I just think if
I'm going to wear lashes this is a look
I should wear a man for liner I'm going
to be using this kiss professional New
York intensify eyeliner I put this on my
hand last night and it took me forever
to scrub it off with a makeup wipe so
this is definitely going to stay put
they sent this to me with my other stuff
like I didn't order this
but I appreciate it so thank you it's
going to be perfect for this look
because we're doing something really
smoky I'm not going in my waterline I'm
just going to kind of line underneath
and then I'm going to go in and smudge
that out just so we can get a base going
for our other shadows and I'm going to
keep it on the outer half though because
they still want to keep a bit of a cat
eye going I don't want to close the eye
off entirely I'm also going to tightline
with this and then I'm even going to use
this and smudge it on the upper lash
line on the outer
this is going to just give a nice smudgy
line some definition and kind of prep
our lash line for lashes while I did
that liner I also do that some white
liner just to kind of give me some more
I don't know a pop so that my eyes
didn't look so red I still want a little
bit more depth in the outer and inner
corner so I'm going to go in with the
yesplease palette and I'm going to take
this darkest color here it's definitely
like a nice more warm brown and I'm just
going to be placing that gently on the
outer portion of the eye and also on the
inner portion of the eye I just wanted
to have more of a halo effect and I feel
like it does right now I have a bit of
fall so I'm going to sweep that away
I'm going to add some mascara and some
lashes off-camera and then I will come
back and we'll finish up the lips and
all you know if I do anything else I
might deepen them and eyebrows a little
bit too but I will let you know once we
get there but my lashes on I just used
individuals both cluster individuals
these are from ardell they come with
like three knots apiece then I used four
on each eye and then I went in with
individuals anywhere I felt like I
needed some I don't know more density
it's crazy how much easier it is to
apply eyelashes on someone else than it
is so so I hope it looks okay I don't
normally wear lashes like at all I don't
know if you're translating but now looks
super blue right now I don't know why
that is it looks pretty good so let's
move on to lips I have two options for
lips so I'm probably going to film a
couple of their videos so I will be
doing something probably more nude just
as I don't feel like totally crazy but I
wanted to use something that I bought
from colour-pop because it just looks so
pretty this is the color what I believe
this is in the discontinued section now
so like it's like a last chance item I
think you can still get it if you want
it not sure so I'm going to put this on
my lips and then I'm going to highlight
the inner portion on my lips with that
gold shadow from the yesplease palette
so I'm going to put this on and we'll
see what that looks like so this is the
lips with just the lip product on now
I'm going to go in with the shadow C I'm
just going to take a little on my finger
and kind of just tap it
I'm also going to take a little bit of
the highlighter from this and just in
the very very center tap this okay guys
this is the final look I hope you
enjoyed it not necessarily super
wearable with this lip and the eyes kind
of dark but it's like good for going out
I don't have something different I
wanted to do something that's not my
norm I kind of want to switch it up I
don't want to look the same in every
single video I feel like I do I don't
know anyway I hope you guys enjoyed and
that is everything for this video I will
see you in my next one thank you so much
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
