channel it's Lauren I feel like I
haven't sat down and talked to guys and
so long I had quite a few videos that I
pre-recorded because I knew that last
week was going to be like insane and it
was it was insane so I kind of just
wanted to talk to you guys there's a few
things that I wanted to just talk about
and do it on like a mass scale see you
guys but like all see it instead of in
the comments or something like that it
kind of brings me into my first like
topic I guess which are comments there
have been so many wonderful nice
comments on my videos lately I super
appreciate it and I just want to let you
guys know that although I might not be
riding back to you or ever or in like
the most timely manner and I'm really
sorry about that I super appreciate all
those comments and those kind words and
all the support you guys are giving my
channel and myself I do appreciate it I
read every single one of those comments
and they mean so much to me a little bit
about me I'm not really like a social
media person like I know that sounds
weird since i have this youtube and now
i have an instagram but on my facebook
like they don't ever post on my facebook
i'm just not a common term when i
started watching youtubes like five
years ago maybe now I was the person
that's silently watched in the
background so I never commented on a
video I never liked her thumbs up the
video like I just didn't do that so kind
of having to switch my mindset with
YouTube and usually i'm just not an
active player and now that i actually
make content um it's just different
having those comments and then be trying
to like write back to them it just gives
me a lot of anxiety so i just want you
guys to know that if I don't write back
to you it's not in like a malicious way
it's not in a mean way I just it's like
my own thing I'm really bad at just that
like these little comments which only
takes so much time to write back to add
up in my head and they become this big
huge thing and it's just very
overwhelming
and yeah so I'm doing my best but know
that if I don't write back to you or if
I don't write back to anyone on that
video it has nothing to do with the
comments it just is probably I'm really
busy or overwhelmed and I'm trying to
work on it so please bear with me it's
just a hard habit to change on top of
the fact that it gives me anxiety so
yeah I just wanted to talk about that
really fast and just wanted to reassure
you guys that I do read them and I do
appreciate them and just refer back to
this video if you ever feel like I'm not
also I try to be more active on my
Instagram so um for whatever reason
Instagram is like easier for me to just
like like stuff and I don't know I think
because I don't have a already like a
habit established with Instagram since
it's new to me I'm forming those habits
now and so definitely check out my
family that link down below but um yeah
I feel like I'm more like liked in
comments and stuff like that on my
Instagram than I am here on YouTube what
you're working on again I'm working on
it I thought I would just update you
guys on last week and how it went and
everything like that um I used to do
stuff like this in my chit chat get
ready with meez but i haven't done one
of those in a really really long time
except for the last one I believe is my
peru trip which only link down below in
case you want to know about it but i
thought i would just talk about last
week and how crazy it was if you didn't
know i did do a look for imats with my
school i did a demo i'm on pro night
which was friday night and it went super
awesome i was really happy with the look
and it was just a really awesome feeling
i feel just so happy that my school
chose me to like represent them at a
convention like I'm at it's a really big
deal and what's so awesome if you guys
follow me on Instagram you already know
but my look was featured on the IMATS
official page so definitely go check
that out you can also see the look on my
Instagram if you want to check that out
that was just really exciting to me and
it's just a really awesome moment for me
I feel like I'm at was a really great
experience for me doing a live demo like
that and
I'm just excited now I have a lot of
anxiety gosh this is like about anxiety
this video but I did have a lot of
anxiety and do have a lot of anxiety
applying makeup on someone it's not that
I don't know what I'm doing I'm just an
over thinker and i like to be the best
and all of these things play into a part
and they kind of affect my mental state
as highlight go into something and for
the first time ever a time at I was just
doing it and not worried and I just had
more control over myself and my emotions
and my feelings and it was just a really
great experience and I hope a turning
point for me so that was really awesome
another thing that happened last week is
my first time on set which was so cool
I've never been on a set before I've
never than make up for a movie and it's
a feature movie that I was just able to
like help along with and that was just
an awesome experience to just know what
assets like and the director and the
sound people and all these you know all
the different parts that make up a movie
and just to be there and experience it
and it was really awesome so I did that
last week too so with school and all of
that it was just kind of crazy and then
what's really awesome as I'm doing a
short film by myself so I'm like the
only makeup artist just me and I'm going
to be doing that next weekend so I'm
really excited for that in what's cool
is i just i do actually just feel
excited instead of just like nervous
like i'm gonna poop my pants so that's
an awesome feeling that's just I just
wanted to update you guys and kind of
like let you know what's going on that's
why I also filmed so many videos and
advanced and if you don't like that let
me know in the comments down below I
usually try to film quite a few videos
at the same time whenever I have time to
film because I'd rather just have
consistent videos for you I've mentioned
this before and I just want to make sure
that that's something that you guys are
still okay with because you know I just
I don't want it to be distracting or
annoying that I'm you know it's
obviously the same day and I'm just
filming different things but it's just
right now the easiest way for me to do
stuff but if you don't like it I can try
to figure something out I just am not
the person that's gonna like change my
top and like put on a different lipstick
to pretend it's a
for a day I'm just not really into that
so yeah let me know about that in the
comments down below as well I also
wanted to address another bigger thing I
had mentioned a sample giveaway in one
of my videos and I haven't done anything
with that yet and I just wanted to talk
to you guys about that here as well I am
NOT going to be doing a sample giveaway
and the reason why is I just as I
thought about it I just felt more and
more uncomfortable giving out these
samples only because I would just feel
so absolutely horrible if one of them
was bad because it was too old or
something I feel like with stuff you
don't realize how old stuff is until you
really start thinking about it and some
of those samples are older and said I
don't even remember when I got and I
just again would feel so horrible and
like not only embarrassed which is like
I just feel bad i'm not trying to like
give someone rancid product and even if
just one of those like 60 samples was
bad i would just feel so absolutely
horrible about it so I just don't feel
comfortable sending that out to someone
so I'm just going to give those two
friends and you know not make it like an
official giveaway type of thing so I'm
really sorry about that i'm sorry to
like get your hopes up or anything again
I just don't feel comfortable I'm
personally not someone who does a lot of
Giveaways I've only done one giveaway on
my channel ever and I probably will do
one want to hit like five thousand or in
the future I'm not really sure I'm
personally not someone that really
participates in giveaways I've never
I've only the one comment I never made
on a YouTube video was to enter a
giveaway like years and years ago like
that's the one comment I ever made and I
don't know I just don't enter giveaways
and I know a lot of you guys really like
them so I'm sorry but they're just not
something that I'm gravitated to as a
cav u'r I think so that kind of dictates
the fact that I don't do it as a content
creator either also I feel like a lot of
the time giveaways are really although
we're giving stuff away to you guys or
to one lucky winner they're really just
a way to generate views and to generate
traffic to your channel and generate
subscribers and that's not really my
style I've worked really really
heard on my channel I just like worked
it from the ground up I don't advertise
my channel in the real world well you
know Naughton I don't tell people like
about it it's not something not that I'm
ashamed of it I just it's a very
specific channel I don't do like a ton
of tutorials I mean project panning we
have our own little community and I
realize that's not everyone's think so I
don't like to go on other people's
videos and be like check out my video or
anything like that which I'm not hating
on anyone who does I'm just letting you
guys now and I feel like for me give
away sometimes fall into that again no
hate for anyone who does giveaways and I
don't think that's the intention of
everyone um that I just think a lot of
the times giveaways can sometimes only
benefit me and also the last time i did
a giveaway I had like people who were
just like giving me fake subscribers to
win the giveaway like weird stuff and I
don't want to generate views just on one
video to give something away to someone
who only subscribed to win the giveaway
and then will unsubscribe I don't like
ghosts followers or ghost subscribers
like my main goal with my channel is
just to like create content that I like
and then hopefully other people like and
if you don't like it I totally
understand and go check something else
out and if you do I would love for you
to subscribe and watch but I'm not it
about like I'm not going to subscribe to
you and then not watch your videos and
I'm not going to want you to subscribe
to me and then not watch my videos it's
not what it's about to me it's not about
numbers it's about just like actually
enjoying someone and wanting to watch
them that's what should make you
subscribe to me anyway enough about the
good boy I just you know I wanted to let
you guys know and give you an update on
that since there had been like no news
about it and that's the reason why I
haven't done anything because I just
feel too uncomfortable and I would just
hate it I and I can't I tried to go
through and I just don't know how it
will send that stuff is and you know you
think some things out that old and then
when you really look at it like you're
like holy cow I've had that for two
years and that's a long time to more
like little things I just wanted to talk
about um I am trying to get other
content up on my channel like I want to
do some Fitbit stuff I want to do some
coloring stuff I
I do potentially get back in my planner
and stuff life's just been crazy so just
know that I know that those are going to
come up and I'm hoping to get some of
that up I love project panning but you
can only do so many videos on project
pans and updates and stuff so I'd like
to just kind of make it a little bit
more well-rounded see what I can do with
that and I know a lot of you guys said
you like that so just know I'm trying to
get that up so it's it's coming
hopefully soon and then last I wanted to
talk about my description box someone
had mentioned in the comments to like
write down my makeup what I'm wearing
and like fill out my description box
which if you guys want that I'm totally
gonna do it I just it takes a lot of
time if you see a youtuber who has their
description box although I filled out
for example I know love Heather at she
like has her thing like locked down she
has everything you could ever want her
description box and linked and it's like
crazy and I like totally respect her for
that because it's a lot of work to do
that and i realize that i should do that
it's just a lot of work so i'm going to
be trying to get better at that as well
so that way you guys can know like what
I'm wearing without asking me and let me
know if you want me to like link
products or just mention products or how
you guys want me to do that if you have
an opinion on that leave it down below
on but I just wanted to address that as
well then I'm sorry it's just a lot of
work and sometimes i just upload a video
before i go to school or whatever and I
you know no excuses I'm just saying I'll
try not to be as lazy I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day this is just
a quick little update i am going to be
filming a couple more videos so if you
hate this this might be the last time um
but i hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and i just wanted to chat
with you and catch up with you and I
just want you guys to know that i truly
appreciate like all we were support all
of your comments it's like mind blowing
and yeah I just want to talk to you like
a real person that's why I like making
YouTube videos so anyway I will see you
guys in my next video that guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
