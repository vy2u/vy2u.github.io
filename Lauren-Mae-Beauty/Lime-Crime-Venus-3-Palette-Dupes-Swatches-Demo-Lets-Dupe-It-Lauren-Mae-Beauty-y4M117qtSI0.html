Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing it less
stupid I haven't done one of these in a
long time I know I just haven't been
inspired by any palettes to you know go
through my collection actually dupe them
I've either been satisfied with the
palettes that I have or if it's
something out there I wanted enough that
I'm actually gonna buy it not just one a
dupe it but anyway today we are gonna be
duping the Lund creme Venus 3 palette
this is something that I don't actually
want to purchase but I just do like the
color story I have some purples it has a
couple neutrals I like that it's a
smaller palette it's a smaller color
story it's something I've been
gravitating to a lot recently so I have
some pretty good dupes I have some bonus
shadows as well so we will get into that
with swatches I have a demo for this
look which will be at the end and that
is obviously using the shadows that I
use to do ba'd a few things up front one
I want to say thank you guys so much for
all the love on my hair being down in my
last couple of videos as well as on
Instagram you guys came out for that
Instagram post it was like crazy it was
like holy y'all I just really
appreciate it just so you guys know I
know this is like stupid but it was like
my first post to get over like a
thousand likes and it has like 1400
likes right now noticed like what the
heck thank you so much so anyway I just
had to say that at the beginning I had a
little bit of curl still left mmm it's
been like a couple days mostly I have
some dry shampoo in and you can't see
the back of my head so that's what's
like making this work also there's like
noise going on from upstairs neighbors I
can't help it they're having a jam sesh
they're having a Juke jam I can't help
it so um yeah just don't mind that
getting back to this video though with
this series I go through my collection
and I pull out single shadows so this
can give you inspiration hopefully go
through your own collection I understand
that if you bought all these single
shadows it would cost more than the
palette itself so I'm not saying that
you should get these instead I'm just
giving you other options I'm showing you
the inspiration I'm taking from my own
collection so take it as you will if you
wanted one color maybe this will help
these aren't exact dupes I don't have
the palette this is just inspired by
that palette as close as possible and I
use the single shadow so I can actually
put them together in the same format
like the palette is situated I think
that's enough of the disclaimer and kind
of like explanation of the series yeah
so let's just get into it the top
palette here those are
oops and then I have some bonus shadows
which basically looks like the same
palette but underneath it I'm actually
really satisfied with the color dupes I
was able to pick out for this in my own
collection I know that they're not going
to be exactly the same but I feel like I
got pretty close I definitely got the
spirit of the palette in these shadows
when they all work together the line
prime of Venus 3 retails for $36 it has
five different finishes within the
palette which is kind of a lot because
there's only eight shades in the palette
total there's a matte there's a shimmer
matte which is described as a matte with
a flash of shimmer there's an iridescent
shimmer which is pearly with a high beam
rainbow effect there's a glow shadow
which is a soft luminous finish which is
a glow not glitter and then there's a
metallic which is a extremist shimmer
finish I feel like it did a pretty good
job matching those finishes but let's
just get into it I'm gonna have the
palette up here I can't be as fancy with
editing because I have new software
because I got a new computer to edit on
and I'm just using iMovie so just follow
along we're gonna go in order
so the first shadow in the palette is
called dreamy and it is described as a
moth and it's a matte finish the first
shadow that I have here and I use this
in the tutorial this is the shade rosy
pink from Coastal Scents I really really
like this color I think it works really
really nicely I like using this as like
a transition shade technically this was
in like a palette that was supposed to
be used as blushes mine's pretty old so
it's still described as bo1 on mine but
if you go to the website rosy pink is
the same color really like this color
think it does them off pretty well it's
a little bit more pink than like dusty
but I still enjoy it and my bonus shadow
for dreamy is a shadow from Luxy and
this is lovestruck this was limited
edition so you aren't able to get this
on the website any more but I'm bringing
it up in case you happen to have it
definitely a bit more pigmented and it
has more of the like dusty pink brown
undertones it's a little bit deeper so I
just wanted to bring that up in case you
have it it was one of the ones I was
like going back and forth between this
and the Coastal Scents shadow the next
shade in the palette is called beam I
feel like this is one of the standout
shades because it has that like purple
it really is like iridescent and an
angelic they describe this as a
lit lilac with a pink shift and it is
one of the iridescent shimmer finishes
for my do I have a shadow from look see
this is purple haze and this does not
have a pink shift but it is highly
metallic and really really beautiful I
have this on my inner lid today sadly I
was looking at the website and I could
not find this but I have another shadow
that seems very similar it even has that
iridescent kind of do a chrome shift so
that will be linked down below but if
you have this shadow or really any like
lilac II type of shadow I think it would
work really well yeah I like this one a
lot and I really love the way it pulled
this look together I have two bonus
shadows for the shade one is going to be
a black light from makeup geek this is a
duochrome
this is very similar to Urban Decay's
tonic it's similar to look-sees duper
star it's a purple with a blue shift to
it so that is a great option if you want
something similar again it doesn't have
the pink shift but it does have a shift
and I think it would work just as well
in the palette and the last bonus shadow
is from Mac and this is stars and
rockets this one is a bit warmer than
the other two but I just I don't know I
think this gives off a very similar vibe
this would be kind of considered a glow
shadow I feel like it has a bit of an
iridescent shift but it kind of just
glows it's not super highly metallic
it's not super iridescent and duochrome
II but this one I thought you know if
you have this shadow you might
incorporate it into a palette like this
cuz it has those purple tones the next
shadow in the palette is heavenly and
this is considered a rich rose gold and
this is an iridescent shimmer so I don't
know how this has like a rainbow effect
to it but that's how they describe it
when I was looking at swatches and
photos of this palette it was really
difficult because a lot of the photos
look really warm and when you look at
the website they're more warm toned and
when you look at other pictures it looks
a little bit more cool toned also I felt
like when I looked at swatches of it on
different people's skin tones it was
just hard to figure out what is this
freaking color actually with all the
different colors and pictures and tones
that were happening but taking all that
into account I thought that high-strung
from colour-pop was a great option for
the shade this is an absolutely
beautiful rose gold metallic finish I
love this this has been in a lot of my
let stupid series
it's beautiful it's so freakin beautiful
look at that I have raved about that
shadow many many times but honestly I
just think it's such a good one
especially for the price my bonus shadow
for heavenly is from makeup geek and
this is grandstand
this is one of her foiled shadows and
again it just has such a beautiful rose
gold finish I feel like this has a bit
more of a warmer tone to it a little bit
more copper in it but they're both
absolutely stunning if you have either
of them they'd look amazing but honestly
I feel like a rose gold metallic isn't
going to be as hard to find nowadays
it's a popular color so I'm sure within
different palettes there are a lot of
different options as well for that
shadow we're finishing up the top rail
with the shade rapture and this is
described as a soft blush with a blue
flash and it is a shimmer matte so that
sounds like a scary type of finish if
you have this palette let us know down
below how you like it but I decided to
go with a pink with a kind of almost
greeny shift this is for luck see beauty
and it's the shade flower child this is
available on the website still and this
is just really really pretty it has that
iridescent I think it fits the palette
really really well it almost has a blue
like I think this is just gonna look so
great whether it's on the lid on its own
or as a topper over one of these other
colors to kind of transform it I think
this would be really really beautiful so
flower child and that's my only one I
don't have any bonus shadows for that
one I felt like this one really just
captured what it was going for the most
the next shade down in the palette is
called ecstasy and this is described as
a dried fig color it is a matte shadow
and this is gonna be the easiest one to
do I mean it's a brown with maybe a
little bit of a purple ma B undertone
it's a deep espresso Brown you can find
this in probably a ton of your palette
so I have two options here just to have
and just to finish out this palette the
first one's from Coastal Scents this is
the shade chocolatier I really like the
shadow I used it in my look today it's a
pretty dank pigmented but it's buildable
I thought it blended well so that is
chocolate cheer and then my bonus shadow
is from itsy and this is the shade
chocolate so you know chocolate is kind
of the color we're going for again
pretty dang pigmented this one doesn't
have like
as much of a purple undertone as the
other one so that's why I thought that
one fit a little bit better but it's
still a really beautiful shadow super
pigmented and again I'm sure you have
something like this in your collection
the next shade in the palette I think is
another one of those really stunning
shades that really draws your eye to the
palette and this is the shade paradise
it is a bright fuchsia with a blue glow
and this is one of those glow finish
shadows I have two different shades here
for you I think that makeup eats
masquerade really does a good job
capturing this it's a warm toned purple
and as much as this is part of the
foiled metallic eyeshadows I don't feel
like this has that same metallic sheen
as so many other of her foiled shadows
so this does have a bit of a glow to it
it has some type of iridescent with like
shifting a different color so I think
this is a really good one
to capture that same essence I did use
that in my look as well today and then
as a bonus shadow this does not have a
similar finish but this is a similar
kind of color this is deep grape from
Coastal Scents this is a matte shade and
I'm not saying this is the best color
ever but it was just another shadow in
my collection that when I saw the
palette I was like oh I'm gonna check
that one out so this one is a bit more
cool toned it is something you
definitely will have to build up but I
feel like it blends out really nicely
and you can definitely create some
awesome looks with it the next shadow is
another really beautiful one it is bliss
and it is described as a rosewood and it
is a matte shade so my option for this
is first kiss from look see this is
available and I feel like this is pretty
dang similar to the one in the palette
and maybe it doesn't have as much brown
in it but I find it really captures it
well it's still a matte shade and I
really enjoy this one so I use that in
my lip today you'll definitely want to
stay tuned for the demo and my bonus
shout out is from colour-pop and this is
the shade flower boy sadly they don't
make this anymore I don't know why they
discontinued it this one I find is just
a bit brighter there's something about
it but they're very very similar I
wanted to go with the look see one just
because you could still purchase it just
in case that was like the one shadow you
needed from a deep palette but if you
have flower boy this is a very similar
color and we're finally at the last
shade
palate this is called beloved it is
described as a minke lavender brown and
it is a metallic finish though I do have
two options for this one it looks like I
did three but two options for this one I
really feel like the first one though
captures it quite quite well this is max
sable and I think that having it
described as that minky
it's kind of cool toned purpley Brown
copper I think that sable just that is
sable there's something about this color
that I think works so well with the
palette so if you have max sable which
is a staple color in a lot of people's
collections it's definitely been raved
about in the past this is very very
similar to that one and my bonus shout I
was a little bit off this one is from
colour-pop and it's called dragonfly
this one's a bit darker I feel like on
different people's skin tones and also
again with the different lighting it was
hard to figure out where this color was
in depth but again I feel like sable
really captured it but if you want
something a little bit darker dragonfly
has that metallic finish it's not like a
super high shine metallic but it
definitely has a sheen and I thought it
kind of went well with the palette so if
you wanted a little bit of a deeper take
dragonfly might be nice alright guys so
those are my dupes for the Lime Crime
Venus 3 palette let me know what you
guys think in the comments again if you
have this palette you really like it
give us a review in case someone is
really wanting to get that one I know a
lot of people don't buy from Lime Crime
though so hopefully this will help you
if you were looking for a specific color
or again just go through your own
collection see if you have similar
colors as much as this palette is a
beautiful color story I don't think that
anything is insanely different than
maybe something else out there
especially if this is kind of your
aesthetic you might already have some
these shadows from indie brands that all
being said if you want to see how I got
this look today using this palette then
stay tuned for the demo let's get to
that eyeshadow look alright hi guys we
are on to the demo portion I obviously
have all my makeup on already and we're
gonna get straight into the eyeshadows
obviously we're going to be using the
Lime Crime Venus 3 inspired shadows that
I picked out that you guys have already
seen so the first shade I'm going to be
using is this mauve color it's the first
shade in the palette and I'm going to be
putting this into the crease we're gonna
go pretty purple today I definitely
could
to go more with those like bronzy
lavender colors like that just have like
a purple undertone to them but y'all
know me if we're gonna do the Venus 3
let's just do it right right so I'm just
going to be blending this softly into
the crease and I'm really making sure to
get this inner corner so that we have
pigment there all right I'm really sorry
if you can hear anything going on
upstairs but I can't control it so we're
just gonna keep moving on I'm gonna next
go in with this shade here I'm using the
one from Luxy and we're just going to be
deepening up and going slightly lower
then we put that original shade but
staying in the crease area and focusing
it on the outer corner although I still
am bringing a tiny bit into this inner
portion and just kind of bringing it
down a little bit lower again then that
other color we've blended on and I am
gonna go back over with the initial
color we used just to make sure we still
have that peeking through and last for
the mattes we're gonna go in with this
shade here it's the only dark matte and
I'm going to just be building this up
slowly on the outer corner just so we
have a little bit more depth there and
then just to make sure everything's
blended we're going back in with the
other two colors we use and just kind of
transitioning them till we get a
seamless of a blend as we possibly can
I'm honestly not having really any
fallout which is amazing so I feel
pretty good about where we're at if you
like this I might be a little bit darker
we're gonna go with it next I'm going to
be taking a glitter primer I'm using the
one from NYX but you can use anything
that you have and we're going to be
tapping this on to both eyelids just so
that we have a sticky base for the next
shadows to stick to I think you should
do this with probably any like metallic
ish shade you're gonna use but
specifically the ones I'm using from
these brands I think will work better on
top of this base and we're just patting
it over about 2/3 of the eye I'm also
going to be using a flat shader brush
and I'm going to be spraying that down
some spray and we're gonna be going into
the purple shadow
this one's from look see beauty I didn't
see it on the website when I was like
doing this video so use whatever you
have and then I think there's a couple
other colors that are similar to this so
I'll leave those linked as well and I'm
just gonna be putting this on the first
portion of the eye part of me already
wants to just put it over the whole
thing but we'll wait I think that looks
really beautiful next we're gonna just
flip this brush around and I'm gonna be
going in to masquerade this is a makeup
geek shadow and I'm just going to be
patting this on this kind of like
transition so we have something going
into that darker Brown okay I think that
looks freaking gorgeous it looks so good
I'm really happy with it
I have a ton of fall out though so I'm
going to take a powder brush and just
wipe that away and I always put a little
bit of powder on my powder brush so that
when you swipe it away it hopefully
doesn't stick
alright crisis was averted it looks
pretty good I'm gonna go back in with
the brown shade I had put in the outer
corner and we're just going to make sure
there's a nice edge I feel like it looks
pretty good so I don't want to fuss with
it too much
cuz I don't want to ruin it like I feel
like the look looks pretty dang good the
last thing though I do want to do is
just take the my finger and the shadow
we put on this inner portion and just
kind of Pat it in and just get as much
shine as possible okay let's work on the
lower lash line shall we
I'm just going to first bought some of
that first pink we use just on the lower
lash line so let's do that I think
something a little bit different I want
to do is I'm gonna go on with the
masquerade shade and that's what I'm
gonna buff next under my lash line just
to drive home the purple and then I'm
gonna go in with the dark brown and just
put that on the outer corner we have
quite a bit of fallout once again so I'm
just gonna fix that four liners I'm
going pretty normal I'm gonna be putting
white on my waterline I'm gonna put a
dark brown on my tight line as well as
smudge a little on the
or lashline and for mascara I'm going in
with the Kiko golden waves so I will be
back to show you what that looks like
and then I think we might do something
on the inner corner we'll see what this
all looks like before we get back okay
so those are the eyes with mascara and
with liner and everything so I do want
to add a little bit of something to the
inner corner so I'm going to go in with
the light pink shade that I have here
I'm a little nervous because this has
like a green reflect to it and I don't
know how that's gonna look like this I
look but you know I'm using one other
shape from the palette so I guess that's
good we'll just go lightly at first yeah
it's not bringing a ton of light I also
feel like it's somehow got pigment on my
face but whatever okay I'm gonna take a
highlighter that I have next to me just
because it's right here just to actually
add some light all right let's move on
to the lips I wanted to go something
just peachy that's what I did for my
blush as well I like peaches and purples
I like peach with everything really
let's get real so I'm going to first be
putting on a balm this is from Revlon
and if you're going simple and if you
were me you'd probably stop there but
I'm gonna put a little bit of this
katie-cat gloss and catnip and I just
put a little bit just to punch up the
peach color a little but still keep the
comfort of the bomb and the gloss all
right I'm gonna zoom so you guys can see
the final look all right guy said this
is the final look which I guess you guys
have seen throughout the whole video but
I hope you enjoyed this dupes video I
haven't done one of these in a long time
and I just I was looking at this palette
and it's not something that I wanted to
buy but I was like you know what that
color palette is really pretty I like
the different tones and stuff so what
can I do to recreate that in my own
collection so hopefully this inspires
you to either look throughout your
collection to find some similar colors
that you have to create a similar look
or if you have the palette you could
kind of use this tutorial or demo as
inspiration as well so that is
everything if there is a palette out
there but you really want let me know in
the comments I'm trying to get back into
this a little bit more I'm only doing
things I'm really inspired by but yeah
I'd love to
what you guys are kind of wanting to see
some dupes on and that's everything
thank you so much for watching guys I'll
see you my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
