Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing a lip balm
collection video I know this is kind of
weird but I did have a request to do it
and basically ever since I did the weird
makeup products that I really love or
beauty products that I get weirdly
excited about which lip balms and lip
treatments was one of them I thought
this would be a fun idea and then when I
got that request I thought you know what
why not do it so this is my current like
lip balm lip treatment lip primer type
of situation collection so I'm gonna get
into these we're gonna do it like vlog
style for actual showing you the
products I just thought I would do a fun
little interest since I was all dolled
up anyway
but other than that let's just get into
my lip balms and what I like and what I
don't like because some of these I don't
like alright hi guys so this is my lip
balm collection these are treatments lip
balms scrubs primers I have one primer
in there so yeah we're gonna get into it
I think I'm gonna start off with some of
my favorites um and then go from there
just so that it it stays exciting from
the beginning because it is just lip
balms also no fancy nails here sorry
they're not pretty yeah let's get into
it so the first lip balm I have here is
from sol de janeiro this is one of my
favorite brands and I absolutely love
this I think it's a really nice just
good lip balm that's all I have left of
it so not much it is a thicker tube so
it doesn't come out as high but I have
used up a good know 3/4 of this product
at least I love the smell of this I
think it's pretty and you can find it
easily in like a beach bag or in a big
ol bag when it's summertime so this is
one of my favorites and I will
repurchase that when I finish it up
these are some of my favorite lip balms
from the drugstore I have the Revlon
kiss lip balms this one is tropical
coconut this one and this one is a juicy
peach I believe I am almost finished
with the coconut one it's my favorite
one out of the tube but the peach one is
a close second so I highly suggest these
these are like 499 apiece so definitely
more affordable and I think they're
really really nice they smell nice and
they feel really great on the lips next
I have two lip balms from Jack black one
is in the sent box cherry and one is in
lemon I bought these in a 4-pack and it
came with a mint one and a shea butter
one but those are
my makeup kit at the moment I really
like this lip balm especially for my
makeup kit I love that they're in a
squeeze tube because it is very sanitary
these are great too because they don't
have too much shine on them so if you
put them on women or men it's not going
to look like the guys have lip gloss on
which is always nice these also have SPF
in them which is great and I think that
they're really nice so I highly suggest
those as well another lip balm that I
have in a squeezy tube this one is from
Moroccan oil this also has SPF in it but
this is actually one I don't like which
makes me so sad because I really love
Moroccan oil products but this just
feels a little too greasy on the lips
which I know it's Moroccan oil and argan
oil is like their main ingredient but it
was just a little too thin on the lips
for what I prefer in a lip balm so I am
going to be returning this to Sephora
sadly I really wanted to like it I love
the flavor of it it's a mint tea flavor
not like as in mint tea but like mint
tea like you would drink and I really
liked that part about it but I couldn't
get over the texture of it on my lips it
just wasn't something for me so that I'm
gonna be returning I thought I would
show it to you guys anyway though since
it is my collection at the moment I'll
finish up with these two kind of basic
lip balms I have a Palmer's cocoa butter
formula original lip balm got that at
the dollar store and then this one is an
eco lips pure and simple vanilla Sam got
this in some type of like swag bag from
work this one I haven't really tried
much I mostly keep it first Sam whenever
he needs like a random lip balm and this
one I haven't actually opened yet so I
just have those on the back burner at
the moment they're not anything that
special this is the last like
traditional lip balm I would say that I
have in here the rest are like
treatments or just have they're just a
little different than a regular lip balm
but this one is from nukes and this is
the reeved ml lip balm
I am almost done with this I don't even
know if you want to see inside but
that's all I have left which makes me so
excited I do really like this I just
don't love that it's in a pot it's great
for like on the bedside table at night
but it's just not very sanitary for
day-to-day use if you're gonna bring it
around with you but you get a lot of
product for your money this has lasted
me well over a year and I've used it
pretty consistently in that amount of
time so for the price I think this is
like $15 you get a lot of product
moving on into some not quite bombs but
also not necessarily like treatments I
guess this is from Clarins and it's a
lip oil this almost feels like a lip
gloss but it's like a hydrating lip oil
hybrid type of thing
it's pretty nice it smells like mint
which is nice and I do like this product
definitely leaves your lips a little
glossy though and the other one I have
here is from pathology it's their lip
service gloss and balm so it like goes
on as a gloss but kind of turns into a
balm as you wear it I honestly don't
think it's that glossy when you first
use it but I do really like this it has
like a sweet vanilla kind of scent to it
and there's almost like this minty under
note to it so it's a little bit plumping
so I do really like this it's nice I
have three kind of like treatments in
scrubs so my absolute favorite lip
treatment my favorite thing in this
whole group of products is the one edge
lip sleeping mask I freaking love this
stuff
this is just a sample size and I've been
kind of trying to not use it like I have
to force myself not to use it because I
love it that much and I want to kind of
use up some of my other lip balms but
this one is in a strawberry scent but
I've had a lot of you guys tell me that
there are other scents online so I think
there's like a blueberry one I don't
know there are more if you look them up
so highly suggest this though it's
amazing for putting on before you go to
bed my favorite thing about this is that
it does not make your lips peel when you
get up in the morning like if you put a
lot on when you wake up you just rub
them off and your lips are nice and soft
you don't have all this like dead
peeling skin situation we'll stop
talking about that but yeah I love this
next is something that I got in my box
you try on my first-ever boxycharm it's
from pure and it's like a lip exfoliator
I really don't like this I've used it
multiple times and it's just not my
favorite I don't like the feeling of
this on the lips it feels just gross and
it's so soft all the little granules are
like coming out at you and no I don't
know it's not my favorite
so I wish I liked it because I do like
products like this but this one just
wasn't a win for me personally and then
last for a scrub is from ELF I hope this
isn't too disgusting cuz I do use this
quite often but this is there oh it's
gross I tried to start the top of it so
you didn't see all that foundation but
I really like using this after I've done
my full face of makeup and I'm ready to
move on to my lips I can scrub my lips
and get them ready for lip products but
also get rid of any foundation so that's
why they were so nation on it for three
dollars this is amazing I do have the
mint one but they have a bunch of
different scents and flavors and the
last item I have here is from bite this
is just a mini but this is a lip primer
and I just got this for my birthday so I
haven't used it a ton I think it's fine
but I probably wouldn't purchase it I
wasn't really in the market for a lip
primer but I was excited to try one out
so yeah let me know if you guys like
this down below alright guys so those
are all of my lip balms and treatments
and primers let me know if you want me
to start doing a collection series where
I go through different products that I
have so I can give you guys little mini
reviews and you guys can kind of just
see what I have in my collection I don't
feel like I've done that in a while so
if you want that let me know and let me
know what category you want to see next
but other than that I will see you in
the next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
