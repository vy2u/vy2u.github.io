Lauren today we're gonna be continuing
on with my collection series I am
looking at my collection in a very micro
way we're going through each category
individually I'm giving you swatches
giving you little reviews just showing
you what I have in the process I'm
hoping to just have a greater
appreciation for the things that I have
I'm hoping I can rediscover things if I
haven't used it in a long time just
remember past loves and just feel
grateful for the things that I have so
we're gonna start with lip glosses today
I feel like overall my lip collection
isn't that crazy I have a lot of similar
colors I have some fun things and then I
have the ones that I use all the time
we're gonna start with the colourpop lip
glosses because these are what I have
the most of I have seven here and I'm
gonna have everything linked down below
so you guys can find links to it but
let's get into swatches and colors the
first shade that I have here is the
color Finders Keepers this is the first
class I ever got from them and my
favorite one it's a really nice nude and
I really do like the formula of this one
I will say overall I find that
colourpop's formulas for lip glosses to
be very different in formula so I have
like a love-hate relationship some I
really like some I don't I always say
like by your own risk but this one is
Finders Keepers and I really like that
shape the next non glittery one that I
have here was from the sera collection
and this is the shade curvy it's a nice
like lighter peachy nude this is not
something that I love but I have used
this a couple times as like a Lightner
to lighten stuff up so it's definitely
it's not the worst but I definitely feel
like it's a different formula again than
the finders keepers so that is curvy the
rest of the bosses that I have here are
all pretty shimmery this one is from the
My Little Pony and color pop collection
it's in the shade Pony land I thought at
first that this was discontinued but it
is not so again it'll be linked if this
is something you like these ones with
the glitter I will say are very glittery
so if you don't like glitter you won't
like them but I think they're very
beautiful you can feel the glitter a
little bit but I think they're still
really nice so that's a pony land
the next shade here is tight fit this is
the one I suggest the most out of there
like glittery metallic formula I really
enjoy this color I do get that inner
ring of like white when I wear this
sometimes but I feel like I've been
getting that a lot with a lot of
products so I don't know if I can just
say it's this I feel like it's like
everything I wear I just love the color
it's really like natural it has a nice
glow to it so highly suggest that shade
and the last three here are all from the
moonlight magic collection this is the
shade of verbatim and these are mostly
all like clear with like a duochrome
kind of finish to them and it's very
sparkly as well really pretty the purple
one is called my forte and this one is
really beautiful as well has a little
bit more to it and it has like a blue
purple reflect and the last one is the
most like neutral but the most sparkly
this is finesse but I really like this
one for going on the center of the lips
my dough fits a little dirty so sorry
about that guys it has just so much fun
sparkle and shine to it and those are
all my color pop glosses the next
category of glosses are from
bareMinerals these are what I have the
second most of and then I only have one
other one that I have duplicates of so
this is their Gen nude formula I really
love these glosses they're one of my
favorites so I do really suggest these
this first one here is in the shade
sugar and it's a really nice just like
neutral everyday color this is one of my
favorite shades their dough foot is a
little bit different like long and like
a weird foot but this is just such a
comfortable gloss formula it's not too
sticky I really really enjoy it so that
one is one I really really do suggest
it's great I did buy a mini set during
the holiday season so it came with three
glosses and three of their liquid
lipsticks one of the glosses was
actually the same shade of sugar so I
put that in my makeup kit but this is
the shade cosmic and this is more of a
peachy and this is a different doe foot
as you can see it's like more of like
the flat paddle kind this one's really
nice for a summer I've been wearing this
quite a bit in my videos and then last
year is a more cool toned mauve shade
and this is in the color flirt again
I really like this as well these seem
kind of pigmented but they're like the
perfect opacity they add a little bit of
color but they let your natural lip
still shine through so I really like
this formula I can definitely see myself
getting these in the future or picking
up another of the many little kits
because I do like having the different
color variety and the last for my
duplicate like lip glosses these are
kind of a different formula there from
Kevyn Aucoin and they're the molten lip
colors both of these are in more of like
a duo chrome kind of color this first
shade is the color cyber sky and it has
like a blue shift to it I really like
pairing these over especially this one
over a darker lipstick it really lets
the blue purple shine through these are
pretty pigmented and I feel like they're
a little bit more sticky they're not
something I wear on the everyday but
they are fun for creating a specific
look I'm adding something unexpected so
I do think they're really nice the other
shade is cyber opal and this has more of
a pinky golden duochrome to it this is
definitely the more wearable out of the
two again you can layer this and kind of
like add a lighter Sheen oh I had some
of my lip color on it because I wear it
it doesn't quite have the pink
opaqueness that it's showing here
because it's mixed with whatever was on
the doe foot but this is a great shade
to layer over like pink lipsticks add a
little bit of a lighter Center color to
the lip and like I said I think these
are nice for specific looks and this is
the rest of my classes so if they're all
different brands so I'll show you guys
swatches at these as you can tell
they're all very neutral similar colors
I like a nice like medium opacity gloss
something that's gonna give my lips a
little bit of life but I do like
something that shows my lips I don't
like anything really opaque unless I'm
going for that specific look so on the
everyday these work out for me really
really well so let's get into these
swatches starting off first this is the
Revlon kiss plumping lip cream I didn't
really know where to put this I guess it
could go in the liquid lipstick category
but I kind of use it as a gloss this is
in the shade barely blush I really enjoy
this I really don't hear much about
these honestly so it has like a plastic
little applicator it's just beautiful
this is just such a pretty color this
does give you a little bit of a tingle
for that plumping but it's nothing
painful and I enjoy it's kind of
refreshing next is one of my all-time
favorite lip gloss formulas the NYX
butter glosses are just a really good
one from the drugstore oh I like how
comfortable these are this is the shade
Eclair and it's probably the most
different out of my collection because
it is more of like a cool toned
bubblegum baby pink I love this on the
lips I think it's so pretty it's so
comfortable I've had this one a really
long time but it still smells amazing
like cake batter and I definitely want
to make sure I pick up some more of
these once this one goes bad but this is
just great I really really highly
suggest these the next one is from Becca
this is like their crystal liquid lip I
don't know I got this on sale at Sephora
this went along with their light chaser
highlighters this is in the shade
champagne dream flashes Bellini so it
matches the highlighter that I have this
has a very similar doe foot to the
bareMinerals one and this is more than
anything just like a clear gloss but it
has some really pretty pink and golden
shimmers in it so I do like this on the
lips this does give me a bit of a ring
around my lips as well it's gritty you
can feel the glitter it's not an
everyday gloss for me but something
that's fun to pair with different looks
the next gloss and a half here is from
Eden minerals and this one is really
nice it's in the shape Josephine and
it's more of a cool toned color we have
that longer like paddle-like doe foot
this is a beautiful color I love it on
the lips it's comfortable the only thing
I don't like about this is that it does
have a floral like scent slash taste and
I just don't prefer that so that's like
the only bad thing I have to say about
that other than that I would wear this
all the time but because of that it's
you know sometimes hard to wear but I do
love the color and the way it looks on
the lips and the last one here is from
fenty Beauty it's the gloss balm in
venti glow one of my all-time favorite
lip glosses this is one of my favorites
the doe foot is massive but it's just
the most beautiful color I really do
think that she did a great job creating
a universal color that will look great
on all skin tones it's that perfect like
medium opacity it's nothing too much but
it does add a little bit of color with
so nice so I highly suggest this it's
one of my favorites it's a great gloss
this is the one that's like stays in my
purse all the time this one in the
bareMinerals wine and the Revlon one
those are the three that are in my purse
right now and have been for the last
like two months I love them I did want
to mention that I have a ton of glosses
here from covergirl these are all a part
of the katie-cat gloss collection so I
have the entire range I am working on
getting a lip swatch video so I'm not
gonna swatch these all now I keep these
kind of separate from my collection
because I haven't tested them out so if
I test them out and I find a couple that
I like I will add those for you to my
collection and the rest will be passed
on to friends and family but I do want
to try to get some swatches up for you
guys and then this is like a cool like
glitter topper something a little bit
different but anyway I wanted to show
you these because they are something in
my collection but something that I like
to do with PR especially if it's like
the entire range is it's kind of like on
the side until I decide if I want it to
become a part of my actual collection or
not
so anyway though that is everything for
my lip gloss collection I really hope
you guys enjoyed the video I really want
these to be more relaxing and just like
you know easy chill videos for you to
watch so I hope that's how they are
going also if there's the lipgloss
formula you think I would like I would
love to know down below they're kind of
my favorite lip product next to the
palms so if there's something you think
I would like in a color please let me
know down below and that's everything
thank you so much for watching guys I'll
see you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
