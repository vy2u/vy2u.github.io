Warren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a declutter today I'm
going old-school and I am like going
through my entire collection so I know
that this looks like a lot of products
and it is but half of it it from a kit
and half of it is for myself so these
are my personal collection items this is
basically everything and then lip balm
and then I have this here which is my
kit and the reason I've been inspired to
do this not only have I been watching
declutter videos but I'm just realizing
that although I'm not bringing in things
like I used to I have a lot of stuff
that's just getting old so it's not
about like having too many items it's
just at this point some of this stuff is
really old and I need to just move it
out even though I don't want to it just
has to go it's been too many years and I
need to say bye for my kit I'm just
making sure that everything is still
really fresh most of this stuff is newer
because I bought it for my kids but I
just want to kind of go through and see
if there's anything I can kind of kick
out maybe that I'm not using in my kit
and I can move over to my collection or
declutter so we're gonna start with my
personal collection first I will try to
go fast all heads I might break it into
two parts at this end the thing long
also forgive me for my nails they're
disgusting and you might hear the video
that I'm rendering right now on the
computer because I have an old old-ass
computer and it's very loud so anyway
let's get into it these are like lip
balm so vote for that last and then
these are all like any type of lip
products I feel like that's not that
many compared to other people on YouTube
my house first thing off the top I know
I want to get rid of these buxom glosses
I like buxom glosses I think they're
really nice and they're like they're
just so beautiful but these are pretty
dang old I got these in a kit for
Christmas like a long time ago and it's
just - they're too old I don't feel
comfortable using them at this point
and I know myself I don't use up lip
glosses so these are going to go so all
of those is six minis you should roll
that container hmm
hang out all the bomb and I'm going to
put them all in here
I have minion and then sadly this is
buxom White Russian I don't want to get
rid of it either but I know this is too
old as well I got this I can't remember
I bought this during a vib sale I said
like almost 3:00 oh my videos done I
remember when I bought this it was for a
div sale when I still have even Arizona
so that almost definitely over two years
ago and even more than that so I
definitely think this is like way too
old I need to get rid of it yeah a
keeper this one is from colour-pop this
is the color Finders Keepers when my
favorite glosses I love this and it is
relatively new in my collection this is
an X butter gloss I got this a while ago
as well I'm going to pass this on I just
don't use it and I told myself I didn't
use it by the end of this year get rid
of it but I really don't see myself
using it at all some of your sizes this
is a bottom eaten minerals and I just
got this recently like this year it's
nice I really like the color of it the
only thing I don't like is that it does
have like a flowery scent to it I am
going to keep it though I wore it in a
recent video and a lot of people liked
it and I think it's really pretty I just
wish it didn't have the floral scent oh
this is something still in the box this
is the buxom lipstick in dolly it's just
a backup I love this I have one open
right now I finished one up so it's
definitely a keeper I have two liquid
lipsticks here from Kat Von D and I'm
going to get rid of both of these this
first one here is damned and it's such a
pretty color I've worn it in a lot of
videos but you have to layer this up so
much to get an even coating that it's
just not worth it I would never wear
this in real life the formula is just
not good should see your taping so
McGarrett and then I also just don't
like liquid lipsticks you guys know that
so I don't really I don't need ones that
I'm not going to wear outside of life
and then this one here is the color
Requiem it's a pretty color but it just
doesn't look good on me like it does not
look good on me so I'm going to also go
to that one this is a new one from kiss
I recently just did a video with this I
will leave it link down below I really
like this on this color it looks like it
going patchy but it actually doesn't
which is crazy it's a very interesting
color the formula is really
I thought it was going to stain and it
didn't like I'm just really happy with
this so I'm going to keep that just at
least her fun plug it down old I've
already used it on myself so I can't put
in to make it I might wear it in a video
or for something fun later down the road
seeing that this done cause medicines a
little liquid lipstick as well but it's
kind of more like the soft matte lip
creams from NYX that's like the formula
of this I do like this enough to keep it
and it is relatively new once again
that's my main focus on this it's just
like getting rid of old this is an
oldie this is on to your and this is a
really pretty lipstick on this very
sheer which is definitely my style you
guys know that so I'm going to keep this
I only have a little bit left that's it
well I have left oh I just want to
finish this up this year hopefully I can
get it gone because it's definitely
getting old it doesn't have a smell to
it or anything but it needs to go soon
and I hope that the way I can get it
gone and by using it up another liquid
lipstick here this is from la splash and
this is the color Katrina
it's one of their like duochrome liquid
lipsticks I bought this I want to say
last year and I not but I think it's
been a little over a year so I am going
to keep this one as well for like
another year just to have it because
it's not that old I got it when I lived
here in California at least that's like
one of the big things I'm realizing is
there's a lot of stuff in my collection
that I bought when I lived in Arizona
and I've lived in California a long time
now so oh yeah anyways another look with
lipstick this one is from Stila I did
buy this in California so I'm going to
keep this a little bit longer too this
is one of my favorite colors in a liquid
lipstick that I have just so pretty I
really like it but I will probably end
up getting rid of this by the end of
next year or like the next time I kind
of go through my lip products
how many lipsticks it's so funny that I
have so many liquid lipsticks one I
don't you know I don't use them I have a
jouer one here again a really pretty
color it's almost exactly the same as
Stila actually so you know what I'm
going to do I'm going to get rid of the
steal one just because it is but older
got that before I started working at the
Beauty Collection when I lived here
and I have another working there it'll
be two years in November which is crazy
so anyway I'm going to keep those doing
I don't feel like this is just like a
blast from the past kinds of clutter I
have to line cries I know I got this
like a year or so gonna keep it and then
this one I don't know when I bought this
I'm going to smell it oh it still smells
good I'm going to keep both of these I
really do like their formula honestly
it's very spin which is something I like
it feels like there's nothing on the
lips and these are both unique colors to
my collection and again I don't have a
lot of liquid lipsticks so I'm just
going to keep these probably until it's
time for them to get thrown in the trash
then I have Kathleen together nice I
feel like I just wore this in a video
recently I think this is a really pretty
color too nice red I don't have anything
like it so I am going to keep that a
little longer actually yeah it still
smells good so I will keep that a little
bit longer how are we doing guys I hope
we're doing okay I'm going to clean off
the swatches before the liquid lipsticks
get me another thing off the top here
that I have to get rid of and I'm so sad
this is techno pagan from OCC I love
this I remember wearing this I think on
a honeymoon I don't know we're in San
Francisco and I felt so cool I was
wearing this and it looked so cool with
my hair and everything kind of no such a
pretty color I would love to have this
in my collection again obviously it
looks brand new I didn't wear the time
but the times I did wear it I really did
like it but it's time to go good luck
like these little hard decisions I'm
making because that is a product I like
and would recommend and I just have to
get rid of it what the heck I have to
get rid of it because it's just too old
I need to be real with myself one it's
like my growth Lauren come on and I know
myself and it's like I want to keep it
within a month in the back of my head
I'm sitting there like well I don't want
the lipstick and I'm just cheap
but I want to like go when you're
purchasing trying to like not spend a
million dollars on makeup anymore this
is something I feel like I recently did
a video on like within a last year so
this is from Maybelline and it is the
color sapphire sapphire siren it's a
matte it's really pretty it's actually
pretty similar to techno pagan
there are like little dots on it let me
see if I can zoom in do you guys see
those like little things is that like
bad or because it's
I not only know let me know in the
comments if I should get rid of this I'm
just going to like put it to the side
right now because it's not that old in
my collection but I also don't want to
like you know be putting something gross
on my mouth I don't know let me know I
will listen to you guys I have some lip
liners here so we'll just go through
these I have two for bikes
I don't know their I just got these
in an influencer so I'm going to keep
these one is in zero twenty and one is
in zero 44 I do really like them let me
swatch them this is the dark one and
this is the lighter one really pretty I
do like the formula on them so I'm going
to keep those this is a lip liner from
Ben Nye and I got this in my kit when I
first started school it's an OK lip
liner I like the color
I just I'm gonna get rid of it I don't
need it in my collection this is a
product from Jordana this is the color
tawny I want to say I do really like
this color or like the formula and I'm
almost done with this actually so I'm
going to keep this one I feel like this
is the lip liner I use the most of my
collection this is a lip liner from
essence in the color
honeyBun I've never used this and it's
really similar to the bite Beauty one so
I'm going to actually get rid of that I
have two lip liners here from colour-pop
now if you saw my colour-pop haul in
review I talked about how the lip liner
is the list goes down you just have to
push them really freaking hard like
harder than you'd think
and they'll stay so I did that and they
all stay on now so thanks for everyone
before telling me that but I still think
that's kind of crazy this is a color
blind King I'm going to keep all of
these I think they're nice I do like the
formula this one is the color dukes
which is a nice dark one it is very
similar to the bite Beauty but I'm going
to keep this one as well and your next
one here is Aquarius this is the new one
and it's super pretty I really like that
as well so I have a tiny little lip
liner here this one is from the brand by
Terry I am so close to being done with
it so I'm going to keep it until I
finish it hopefully that'll be by this
year so it'll be gone I think I don't
have a few lip liners left this one here
it's from wild I've used this in a what
out like five product tutorial or
whatever specific color bear to comment
and it's really pretty but I think I'm
going to move this into my kit
I think it's nice but I just don't know
how much I'm going to wear it in my
collection plus I have similar colors so
I'm going to move it to my kit and then
last year I have a bad Medina lip liner
since a very like a bubblegum pink color
I will never wear this but I am going to
also put this one in my kit as well wow
we are making some progress this is
taking forever though so I'm pretty sure
at this point I am going to be doing my
kids lip product in a separate video
another product from Dior this is the
lip glow from Dior and I've also used a
bit of this and I'm going to keep this
this is another one of those products
such as getting old and I need to I just
I kind of ruined it I need to kind of
use this one up so I'm going to try to
use this up again by the end of the year
and see if I can do that so that way I
can hopefully get my money's worth out
of this one it's just I want to get rid
of this by using it this is an unopened
package from Smashbox this is the color
audition yeah I think this is the color
Edition I'm going to put this into my
kit I have to invite beauty lip products
here so these are I know are super old I
just need to get rid of I think almost
all of these I'm going to maybe keep one
to try to use up by the end of this year
but yeah so this one's really pretty
these are like the news I have the color
lychee and the color musk in this one oh
my gosh I'm not even in a good frame I'm
sorry guys this is the color date that's
the date and this is the color fig I
don't know which one I want I think I
left the nude ones better than this one
this one's a little more like pink yes
I'm going to get rid of that one and you
guys this one is more like wild and
crazy colors and again it's just too old
so I'm going to get rid of this and I
know I'm not going to go through this in
the time I would need to they're
beautiful I really wish I would have use
them I remember in my like peak of
addiction I thought those were so cheap
because they were only $14 a piece I'm
sure you guys also have things where you
look back and you think like wow I was
smoking some crack so okay I'm putting
this in my keeps but again it's one of
those ammonia by the end of the year
these are they're brand new because I
got
that influence your box this is the
color from a comb it's super pretty I'm
going to keep it and wear since the
color whiskey I don't have a ton of
colors like this I'm also going to keep
that as well you guys know for my wrist
product like my favorite lip product
video I will have it linked down below
if you haven't checked it out I love all
these products I'm keeping all of them I
love like the NARS lip pencils like this
I love the nude sticks as well so I'm
keeping those is something newer to my
collection this is from Tarte and I got
it as the Sephora birthday gift this
year I actually really like this and
they really like the formula again it's
kind of one of those like lighter
powdery formulas so I'm going to keep
that hopefully I can make some good
progress with this stuff I love this is
this from Revlon this is the HD dawn lip
color and I recently use this in my last
like tutorial I'll leave a link down
below if you want to check it out but I
love this color all swatches I'm trying
to swatch everything just so pretty easy
I love it I have two of these Revlon
color bombs and I thought these recently
so they're not old like I'm never going
to use that so I think I put this in my
kit yeah that's not old but I don't
really want it and staying with this I'm
not going to use it I just know not so
that's good pop this and put them into
my kit this is my buxom and it is the
color undressed it's like one of the
really nude colors I'm going to keep
this and try to get more use out of it
it is really nice and pretty but it's
super full coverage hopefully I can try
to use that one up I would gifted this
from a fellow youtuber autumn here on
YouTube I'll leave a link down below the
rest of the products in here are all
from either color pop or lorac a lot of
jet color pops were sent to me from love
Heatherette I will also leave her link
down below come to chromatography is
real with myself as possible if I'm
going to use the color or not and yeah
the first one here this is the color
monkey and this is one that Heather sent
over that is crazy bright um I just
don't think I'm going to use that so I'm
going to put that as a path pile is over
there this is from lorac and this is the
color
Italian rose I don't really have any
colors like that so I think I'm going to
keep that one plus I really like this
formula this is the color burgundy wine
from lorac these all came in a set that
I bought together once again I don't
have a ton of colors like that I'm going
to keep it this one's older this is from
lorac and
is the color mauve I think this is what
I'm going to keep but I really want to
use up that is definitely any color I
really like it and I love again the
formula of these I think this is the
last lorac one this is the color autumn
and this is like a brownie nude once
again super pretty on Nikita do the rest
your color pop let's get into it this is
the color juicy this is a hyper bossy I
think that was actually kind of pretty
I'm going to keep this just through
summer to see if I use it next I have
the color Fiesta this is a cream fish
um I don't think I'm gonna use that once
I'm going to pass that one on I have the
color wet I bought this because it was
like going out of stock and I just
always wanted it such a cool different
color I'm just going to keep it because
it's different in case anything comes up
and I need something like that this is
the color button it's a satin finish I
think this is a pretty color but I don't
see myself wearing it I'm really not
into like really warm nudes I rather do
cool this is the color Aquarius I am
going to keep this one I really like
this color you know it's just like
cooler than button I hope I might focus
good this one here is the color cake
again it's one of those really like warm
tone I'm going to get rid of that one
it's just so bright I know I'm not going
to wear it this is the color peppermint
and I don't know what color is that it
looks really similar to that color I'm
just going to get rid of that one this
is the color konichiwa this is from the
Hello Kitty collection I'm going to keep
that one oh this one's different this is
the color brill I remember for so long I
wanted this off the website it's really
pretty but not really my style so I'm
gonna get rid of it this is the color
freshman that's it there I'm going to
keep that one again for summer and last
guys okay this is the color corset it's
like a warmer purple than the other one
I'm also going to get rid of that one
because I know I will
Carrie I am so inherently proud and
remove everything back in here that I'm
because it's not gonna flow anymore one
so these are the products that I'm
keeping that have like a lot of color to
them and then these are what I'm getting
rid of let's go through the lip balms
really fast and then we'll we'll go to
part two starting off I know I want to
keep these Revlon
things are going to roll off the table
so much I know I want to keep these
Revlon ones these just are my favorite
lip balms they're so good keeping for
the big lips this is so old I'm getting
rid of it these are all brand new to my
collection
I just bought a kit with four of them I
love using these in my makeup kit
because they're easy to squeeze out to
stay sanitary and all that and I use lip
balm on people all the time so I will be
keeping these this is something I really
have I got another to set up but I need
to this is from ELF and it is their
sugar scrub like lip scrub and I got the
mixed flavor so I'm going to keep that
and just get more use out of it because
I haven't really tried it and then that
baby lips and again it's just time for
this one to go get out of here I have
another Revlon one I'm going to keep
this but if I'm not using this by the
end of the year I'm gonna pass it on
this one okay this is another one like
I've wanted to keep for so long I got
this in in if feedback and not having
honesty and own time so Tasha go I like
that one this life kept it so long okay
this is the color whisper from
Maybelline this is time doesn't been
discontinued they don't make these
anymore but I'm really close to
finishing this up I just lie if I'm not
that close but I really want to try to
finish this up this year so it's one of
those ones I want to like work on to
move out so I'm going to keep it and it
doesn't haven't changed like texture
consistency or smell or anything this is
a bird speed and this is really old -
something to get rid of it this is a
newer one and coconut and pear not my
favorite but I am my hope was constantly
asking me for lip balms so I'm going to
keep this for him seeing what this one
from Palmer's this was nice and he'll
ask me for a long time telling him he
like use of lip balm so much I came at
this and then was done with it like
halfway done so we're just going to
finish that one up there's no reason to
get rid of ones you don't like shape and
then this one here is from fresh this is
getting kind of old but again I'm so
close to it I just want to finish it so
I'm going to keep it that is everything
for the first round
this is everything I'm Kiki
and then I'm getting rid of all of these
ones I'm going to count them up really
fast let you guys know what I'm getting
rid of I'm getting rid of 27 items lip
products that is amazing I feel like my
lip product election wasn't even acted
compared to what it used to be and other
people so I'm really happy with getting
rid of 27 items
it feels so freeing to get rid of some
of the stuff that I'm just saying
keeping because it's like nice or
whatever so I know that you never came
the light of day and honestly most of
these are probably just going to end up
in the trash because they are a waste
they're so old and they never got used I
think that this declutter for me and the
fact that a lot of this stuff is just
old enough I'm getting rid of it is just
such a I open ER and it helps me realize
like I don't need to buy so many things
in bulk you might a couple things at a
time and you don't have to buy like 700
lip products at one time and then by 700
more and two more months just because
they're coming out because I'm telling
you you will not be able to work through
them and there will be so many that you
don't even use like but you've never
even used one it's different if you
really like something and even if you
only use half of it you enjoyed it that
is worth the money but we're stuff that
you just didn't like this to me like for
example this to me is worth the money
because I really did enjoy it but some
products in here I really didn't they
weren't either good or whatever you know
anyway I'm a software able unless move
on to part two I will leave a link down
below I'm going to try to upload these
on the same day two guys who get them
I'm sent it okay oh thanks so much ray I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
