going to be a displeasure of all the
products that are in my actual makeup
kits if you haven't seen part one I'm
going to leave it linked down below I'm
going to try to spare you the long intro
but I'm just trying to go through these
products make sure that it's just newer
stuff and then for my kids specifically
just making sure that stuff I'm actually
using with my kit and then if it's not
do I want to keep it or do I want to
move it to my personal collection and
get use out of it there so I don't know
what this one's going to be getting rid
of as much as the first one but at least
moving things out of my kit into other
places and the reason that I'm probably
not going to get rid of as much which I
think you guys can understand is that I
do it doesn't need to suit me this is
for everyone I'm trying to have a makeup
kit that I could basically do any look I
needed to so you need to have a lot of
options anyway let's get started I'm
going to start off with this one here
this is like the new first thing I am
going to get rid of this this is from
Bobbi Brown and it is a little lip
palette I've had this for a very long
time and it's just time to get rid of it
I don't feel comfortable using it on
anyone and I haven't used it on anyone
in a really long time so I am going to
be getting rid of it this is kind of a
weird one this is a really glittery lip
gloss I got this in my kit and it's
pretty so I'm going to keep it I've
never opened it so it's still good in
that way I'm just going to keep it a
little bit longer just to see if there's
anything that pops up that I might need
it I don't know actually you know what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna swatch it my
hands are all cleaned so if anyone's
wondering all of these products since
they are my kid if they have a doe foot
applicator having never touched anyone's
lips it's really pretty I'm going to
keep this one just for a little bit
longer
oh that's the wrong place shoot I
thought I'd have enough containers but I
didn't this actually isn't mine this is
a different makeup artist so I need to
get this back to her so I will keep that
for her this is such a pretty color this
is really NARS it's the color bound and
it's been one of them like velvet like
lip products so pretty I use this all
the time definitely keeping this highly
suggested so beautiful like one of my
favorite products this is the NYX lip
lingerie and I don't know the color this
isn't a color lace detail I am going to
I've never used this at all very very
nude
I'm going to keep this I don't usually
like using like liquid lipsticks on
people but I'm going to keep that one
just in case because I really don't have
a lot of them since I don't like to use
them this is something I'm going to keep
this in just like a gloss it's just a
clear gloss and I do actually use that
quite a bit this is a cargo lip gloss
and I got this from someone it's just
kind of ugly to me I'm going to get rid
of that one
I feel like this color it's similar
about I'm kind of okay with not offering
that other color I'm going to keep this
Laura this is from NYX it's their soft
matte lip cream love that so pretty I
use that quite a bit and I haven't had
this in my kit and here yet another one
from NYX this one's really pretty I like
to actually mix these together so I'm
going to keep that these are some butter
glosses again these are like hitting
barely there your mark so I'm going to
keep these as well I really like it
makes lip products I think they have
really nice ones they're affordable for
lip products I'm okay with not having
just like the most expensive ones
because I don't know you go through
chest so fast I try to just have like
really staple colors and the most
expensive product another NYX Glosson to
keep that and again I feel like I can
mix the color to get that one so I still
feel good about that decision
this is something which is kind of fun I
put in my kitchen because this is from
one wild and it came out like at the end
of last year it just looks really cool
like duochrome lip gloss I'm going to
keep that it was like a joke in case you
never know and then this one is also
very similar and it has like a glittery
peachy bronzy pink color
it'd be really pretty in the center of
the lip and these are more for like if I
was doing something more editorial this
is a product on Juice Beauty I've never
used it breaks up a lot from this going
to get rid of this I've never used it I
don't really want to I'm going to finish
up with these glasses this one's from
honest Asya I really like for lip
glosses so I'm going to keeping that
these smell really nice
they're super pigmented so I can like
sometimes I'll put a bomb with it just
to give more of a sheer
I really like mrs. Leung from lorac it
has like a pink iridescent to it and
again it's a really light one but I like
the color of this and I can use it to
mix I'm going to keep that as well I
have quite a few lip liners in here so
I'm gonna move on to those I think most
of these are relatively me no again
really a lot of this stuff is new
I have max world I'm going to keep that
I just got that this is from Norris also
a brand new one to my collection
I guess I'll swatch these sorry guys
this one is in the color Maori Key
Island and it was really hard to say
sorry I'm let me swatch whirl for you
that's it next to it
super pretty this is from Jane Iredale
and this is the color spice I really
like that one as well we want to keep
all of these honestly this is the color
petal from laura geller these are all
nudes if you can't tell this is the
color rose from Jane Iredale this one's
more pink
this one's from Palladio I really like
these lip liners as wow this is a little
bit darker this one here is nearly nude
and it's a little bit lighter and then
last here is the color just nude from
laura geller
so yeah I think that's a good range I
love lip liners I love them so I'm
keeping them on okay these are what I
have like never really used in my kit
not much so I don't review and just make
sure that they're still good there's a
few colors I feel like that are
different enough to keep in here and
then other than that I think I might
even move them into my collection or get
rid of them this first one is melted fig
it's such a pretty color it still smells
good so this is one I'm going to keep in
the collection this is the color melted
macaron I'm also going to keep this in
here because I won't use it on myself
melted teeny when I talk to you I do
really like these I just I don't know
why I never reach for these I think I'm
going to try to make it a point to maybe
use some of these I have two melted
paintings in here I'm going to keep one
in there I'm going to move one to my kit
so anything like I'm getting rid of
flush moving I'm going to put it
this is melted chihuahua this one and
CID are probably the ones I'll use them
most I have used melted Chihuahua before
really pretty and keep that one in here
I'm also going to clean up I don't know
why they look crazy and then last is
melted nude and again do I think that
looks to do I don't really like that one
I'm going to just throw that away
it freaks me out this one is a melted
chocolate this one is not old at all and
this one is like different than all the
others it has like a really glittery top
coat really pretty and they keep that as
well
right well I got rid of two what can I
say put these all in here because these
are all my keeper I'm also going to move
over the colors that I wanted to move
into my kit and to hear from my last one
my last two clutter is what I'm trying
to say we are onto the lock section here
so first off my little palette that I
made I took products and put them in
here so that I could have my own lip
palette so this one is my darks in red I
have like my crazy colors here and then
this one's my news obviously I use this
one the most
I really do like this palette I
obviously like all of them so I'm going
to keep those two cool during any of
those so now onto these products here
these are all going to be darker colors
again they're all like more brights or
whatever then news I - soft matte lip
creams here from the beginning from NYX
I'm going to keep both of these one is
like a really nice red color this is not
that pigmented actually and this one I
really like these are like my type of
colors like I love those types of rice
so first you're going to keep that one
this is just about my favorite I don't
know man I'm not that this is a maybe
pile this is something from NARS that I
really like this is the color : oh yeah
this is Cruella from NARS
really pretty love that this is one from
lorac it's just a lip gloss and really
pretty and or going to keep that another
soft matte lip cream this one is more of
like a mommy fuchsia I'm definitely
gonna keep that one I'm just going to
get rid of this red one now I know I
don't need it this is from Revlon it
came in that set of those
other ones and I'm going to keep this
just because it's a different color I
might need to just like to pop this
though into my palette I have a darker
lip glosses for Lana Sofia I use the
phone quite a bit especially on like
darker skin tones really really pretty
oh it smells so good - they seem so good
this is from NARS and I love this color
it's very similar to the NYX one but I
like Temple another lip gloss or
monstrovia this one's one of my
favorites - this is the color berry I
use this on so many people so pretty for
this I like to use a lip balm sometimes
and send it out a little for like
lighter skin tones or on darker skin
tones put it full color this is from
lorac and other lip gloss this is like a
red one
really pretty see like these two
actually are so similar and I like this
one better so I feel happy with that
decision another kind of radical
opposites Romanus obvious I am going to
be keeping it as well so good like their
office if you need to adjust their
losses for your kit I just think they're
so good they're so worth it this is the
color maple again so pretty they just
perform so well honestly another one
from NYX this is the butter gloss this
one's really pretty as well I'm very
like pink tone bubblegum but I am going
to keep that one because sometimes maybe
like more of a bubble moment this is
what I've used a lot you can tell this
one is so easy because it's just kind of
a clear nude it's just a hard candy but
it's a really nice one I am definitely
keeping that I've gotten so much more
use out of that than I ever thought I
would some other glosses I've really
enjoyed since I've had them these are
from Laura Geller I use both of these
very often as well they just have good
pigmentation they're not quite as opaque
as the anasazi ones which are kind of
like again sometimes I kind of water
those down if you will and I don't have
to with these ones but there are just
really beautiful colors the reason some
of these are nude is because I put my
most usual products also in here and
that's why love this color from Laura
keeping that this decoder is definitely
not good
okay something I can get rid of this is
from feel Bigelow it's a lip balm we
don't want that this is a color from
colour-pop in the shade of Frida
this isn't like my drawers I'm going to
move it back to my drawer now this one
is the one for Montes yeah I use the
absolute most this is the color raisin
and its value to fold so pretty like so
pretty really on trend highly suggest
that color another lip gloss from lorac
keeping it I feel like honestly sets
with like nude colors or whatever are
really good to get for your kid I have
two more melted ones in here this one is
melted fuchsia I'm going to move this
back to my kids I just I'm not going to
really use that on set and I really do
like that color so I'm going to move it
this one in the color very is really
pretty I'm going to keep that one in
here though this is another one from
Laura Geller I really do like this it's
a nice sheer color and I do like sheer
stuff for my kids I have a couple of Mac
colors here so I put in because it's
rebel
I actually was gifted this from autumn
and since I don't know how old it is
I've never used it I'm going to just
move it back into my stuff these ones
here are new to me I just bought these
so the first one is the color cream in
your coffee so pretty love that one the
next one I have is the color syrup again
so pretty these are just nice moon these
are colors I use all the time and then
this one here is the color verbs so
pretty I really want to make a lipstick
palette like that but with just matte
lipsticks or just like honestly my most
go to because this is just so much
easier to use than something like this
so I really would like to get the best
news in one palette now that these
aren't good but I just put what I had in
here you know and I like it and people
love it and it's great but I really
would like to have narrow one down this
is a Smashbox incident that I've never
used this but you want to keep it just
in case this is sometimes really good
for lip balm too it gives a little bit
of moisture to the lips but it's not
going to come off as kawase well this is
not necessarily a super crazy declutter
at least I got to kind of show you
what's in my kids okay we have a lot of
Milani colors here I bought these
because I was doing a specific kind of
look with like darker lipsticks and I
didn't feel like I had enough in my
parrot I probably did um but that's
totally me to freak out and buy stuff oh
and this one here is the color Matt love
I'm going to keep all these I just need
to move them into a palette this one is
the color Matt flirty this is the color
of Matt iconic I did use a little bit of
this one really pretty classic ring and
your last one here is the color double
espresso that is like a straight up like
almost brown so I'm going to keep all of
those and those ones again are ones I
probably should switch into powder
I have a few new sticks here I love
these I'm not going to get rid of on the
first one here is a Sibel if you're
looking for good colors new sticks has a
great line great colors great formula I
love them this is a colored blush and
then this is my favorite and the one I
use the most in mystic love that one's
so pretty this is my lip balm from
jackbox it is almost done so I'm going
to actually move this here and put a new
one in so I don't have to worry about
running out on set and I'll finish it up
and put in my empties the last thing I
have here are some lip liners I'm going
to keep all of them imagine it
this one is crimson from Jane Iredale
just a nice red another one from Jane
Iredale and terracotta that went to
having like my favorite I love her lip
liners if you are looking for some good
ones
she has great ones this is the color
nutmeg which is a little bit more Brown
and then I do have the color plum from
her as well I've never used that one on
set this is a darker lip liner from
Milani I bought that at the same time as
those other ones more purple challenge
this is the color sugarplum and last
amber by cherry one this one is no I
think I'm going to get rid of this one
on my kit - you can write like lip liner
this one just a little old this is dope
Dolce plum so man I get rid of that one
okay guys let me move this stuff back in
I had this one wasn't as much of a
declutter in the classic sense but I'm
really happy to have gone through I feel
a lot more just happy with what I have
in my collection kind of re familiarize
myself with things that I don't use all
the time and what
you have it feels good to know 100%
confidence that all these products that
I am keeping on this site are new work
that I feel confident using that are
good quality and all that and then for
stuff in this drawer that I'm going to
either be getting rid of or moving on to
my personal collection I'm just happy to
not have this bulk in my kit I'm not
carrying around things that I would
never use in the first place so that is
awesome thank you so much for watching
guys I hope you guys enjoyed these I am
going to be doing more to clutters to
let me know you want to see next and
then I want to be like a collection
video at the end lift like my storage
and everything I'll see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
