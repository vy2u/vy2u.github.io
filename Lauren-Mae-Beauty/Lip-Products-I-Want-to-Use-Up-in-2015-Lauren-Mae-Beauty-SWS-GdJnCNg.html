realized this project pan video for a
while this is going to be all the lip
products I want to use up in 2015 I have
quite a bit of stuff that I want to use
up I think it's kind of again an
ambitious goal but I'm super excited I'm
not usually a lip product type of person
but I'm really trying to get use out of
the lip products that I do by and enjoy
them so without further ado let's just
get straight into it the first thing
that's kind of the biggest thing is this
bobby brown lipstick palette so this has
a lot of different shades of lipsticks I
think it's like their best-selling I
think it came out for like says 20th
anniversary of lip palette has all the
shades on the back I don't think there's
a ton of product in each one of these
and I thought this would be a good thing
to use up it was one of the first things
ever bought I think it just has like a
ton of shade so throughout the summer
and winter I can be using this up and
hopefully pan this is gonna be another
pan my palette on this year so I want to
use that up I have to tart like chubby
six I want to use up this one is in the
color glisten that's how much I have
left there I mean I haven't even gone
past like the tone that comes with it
this is the first one I ever bought and
I want to get rid of it and use it up
it's gonna go bad pretty soon so I want
to get rid of it this one here is
another tart one this is in the color
charmed once again I haven't gotten past
like you know I haven't had to twist it
up at all so that's what's left on that
one lots of product but I have a whole
year to use this stuff up so i think i
can do it I have two Revlon lip butters
besides the one in my project pan I want
to use up creme brulee this color is not
my favorite it's just ugly to me but I
kind of want to try to use this as a
topper and I don't want to throw it away
so a lot of people love it so I'm going
to try to make it work for me yeah we'll
see this rebel and lip butter is in the
color juicy papaya this is the limit
in addition color and it's just a pretty
corley orange color I'm gonna try to use
this up by like spring and summer just
to get it out and these I feel like
because you can tell I've already used
up some I don't know if you can see
obvious tup a little bit i think these
can you know go pretty easily if you
actually like use them hopefully we can
get through that i have this color
whisper i want to use up this is like
pathetic there's nothing left anyway so
that will definitely be gone by the next
update i start in here so it's less bulk
in my collection that's just gonna get
out of there that's not like a big deal
i have a couple lip glosses this is one
of the Korres cherry ones i have the a
different color in a different project
pan again these are just old so I'm
trying to get rid of them so this is
just like a ma vie nudie brownie pinky
color hmm how to use that one up this is
another lip injection by Too Faced did
this is like a weird brownie color but
it comes off pretty much clear I just
want to use this one up to its kind of
going bad do you smell so like sweet
it's weird it's a weird scent but it's
really like this sweet bubble bum but
not I don't know it's a weird scent but
I want to use this up it's not bad it's
not like it's gone rancid but I want to
use this one up these just aren't my
favorite so I know I don't eat them in
my collection another lip gloss is this
Dior one super pretty it's like a rosy
pink color has lots of really pretty
glimmer and sparkle in it it has like a
brush tip applicator off I have other
swatches on my hand so sorry I'm trying
to film as much as I can it's up there I
think it's pretty pigmented for gloss I
really haven't used like any of it Sam
sister got me this for my birthday a
couple years ago and since you spent
money on it I want to use it it's
beautiful the packaging is beautiful I
just I'm not a lipgloss person so I just
want to get myself to use this I think
it'll be a pretty summer shade even
transition into fall so that's kind of
when I'm going to think about using this
color this is kind of in between a balm
and lip gloss this is the korres lip
butter glaze in Jasmine so it's kind of
like the matching one to the lip butter
this is the same like type of color just
in a squeeze youtube I have this and i
also have like I think of pomegranate
wine again just
old everything's old I've had it too
long I want to get rid of it it's really
pretty color on the lips it's just like
a nudie pinky baby pink color I'll
definitely get enjoyment on to that and
I might even use this depending on what
I use up one I was like just a
moisturizer or whatever like in the car
type of thing I have two tins like
stains and I want to use up these are
both just little mini benefit ones I
have Posie tint and cha-cha tint I don't
like stains I think stains end up
looking almost like the same color on my
lips no matter what you do I'm
definitely into the like matte lip
pencil game right now so I just want to
use these up you can use them on your
lips you can use them on your cheeks
I'll probably just using my lips I just
I don't to get rid of them because
they're like classic products but I
don't really want them either so I want
to use them up everything but this is
gonna be bombs or tinted bombs so i have
this another Korres product about a lot
of quarters stuff at the same time along
time ago this is a liquid lipstick in
the color raspberry this is a super
pretty color i'm wanting to use this
around the fault i'm just really just a
nice raspberry berry color I think it'll
look great in to fall and winter so
that's what I'm planning on using this
and again I just having a long time but
I think look good look liquid lipsticks
are great and I want to get my youth
side of this one I haven't really used
it and i want to so this is gonna go
like fall winter of this year this
product there's so many private somebody
lip things i'll be so happy to get rid
of all these one I use them up it'll
feel so good but this one here is a
Stila lip pot in the color bay baie I
don't know this is a super pretty color
i really like it it's like a ma vie pink
and it looks really great on the lips it
feels so plush and great on the lips i
had a set of three of these and i got
rid of the other two colors it was like
an orange and a red because i didn't use
them and i kept this one and it's great
i have had this for a long time but I
really really really want to use this
one up and just enjoy it it's just so
pretty it's great for if you're just
like hanging out something you know low
maintenance lip this is like exactly
everything I want because it still looks
so
on the lips so I will be excited and
enjoy using this one up this year I have
another korres lip butter this is in the
color guava it's just like a white the
one thing about this one is you have to
be careful because if you put too much
on your lips will like be like white
cast it's kind of weird so I'm I
definitely this is either like an
at-home one or very lightly over
something to like maybe mute it out I
have to be a little bit more careful
about using this and just like a regular
ball but I'm excited to use it up this
one smells really good too i like it and
the rest are bombs I have this anivia
lip butter in just the original smooth
kiss 1 i've already hit pan on this one
it is one of my favorite lip balms so i
just want to finish it up and make sure
that it doesn't go bad um it doesn't
have a scent I like this product I like
Nivea products for the lips they're
great drugstore options so this will be
good to use up I have this soft lips and
cherry this I have a lot to use up it is
a skinny tube it starts right there I
like the way I already used like half of
it that's like half of it gone I like
the way this feels on the lips and like
tinkles a little bit so I'm is just a
trap stick I just dunno have a million
chapstick so let's get rid of that one
this one is Lolita it is just a lip balm
I got we were in France last year in
January it is very waxy so I like using
this one at night cuz when i wake up it
still stays on my lips in the morning or
is like a primer or something like that
i've already used up about I would say
half of it so I just don't want it to go
bad and to good lip balm just kind of
working through it like everything
working through it and then this one is
absolutely one hundred percent full this
is the baby lips dr. rescue in the shade
just peachy I wasn't lying when I said I
had all of it to use up this is just a
really neutral pinky shade peachy shade
let's see if you can see it's that one
here it's nice I don't particularly like
that these smell like menthol II but
I'll get over it and I can use this one
up anytime really just a neutral lip
color to wear the
easy so applause the lip products so
many lip products I think overall I have
let's see i have 19 lip products to use
up including the palette it's kind of a
lot especially with that palette but i
think it'll be fun in a challenge so let
