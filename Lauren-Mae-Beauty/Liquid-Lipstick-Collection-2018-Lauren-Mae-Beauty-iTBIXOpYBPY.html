Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be going into my
liquid lipstick collection I am doing a
collection series this year and this is
a micro look in my collection so we're
going category by category I'm giving
you swatches of everything I'm giving
you mini reviews as we go not only is
this a way for you guys to see what's in
my collection but it's a way for me to
appreciate the things that I have and
make sure that I'm giving everything the
love it needs remembering what I have in
my collection and hopefully these are
just like fun relaxing videos for you
guys to I am NOT someone who loves
liquid lipsticks but I do think that
they are nice for specific looks
I definitely don't wear these every
single day I definitely don't wear these
for long periods of time anyway let's
get into my collection and what I have
and swatches as you guys can see the
first ones I have here are from wet &amp;amp;
wild these are from the cathode graphic
collection they came out with four
different liquid catsuit colors and
these did not get very good reviews this
first one here is death to unicorns
now something about these that you
should know is that these are not opaque
these have a curved doe foot applicator
I've heard someone call these a ballet
slipper doe foot or ballet doe foot
applicator I think that's a really good
explanation of it but anyway these are
definitely not opaque so as you will see
from the swatches but that's something
that I love about them I do like more of
a sheer lip color so if you wear these
as sheer colors I think they work well
but if you are trying to get full
opacity from these you are not gonna
enjoy them they're not gonna work out
well
this almost periwinkle shade is called
pastel grunge really really pretty
makes you look like you've been in the
freezer so depending on what look you
want this one is nice and these do have
quite a bit of like sparkle and shimmer
to them as well which i think is really
pretty and unique the most wearable
color from the collection is called
wicked pink and this is a pink gold
color this is like a very messy formula
sometimes a product like bunches up
because it's kind of moosie but it's
still really thin and I feel like this
is pretty comfortable when you don't
layer it up too much it's still
comfortable liquid lipstick and I
like this one it just gives me that
perfect like metallic lip and the last
one here is called gunmetal heart and it
is a gray and it almost has like a pinky
sparkle to it I did a whole review on
the Gothic graphic collection I bought
the whole thing so if you want to see my
thoughts on that I'll leave it linked
down below but that is gunmetal heart
the next brand that I have the most of
our from bareMinerals these are their
gen nude liquid lipsticks I bought these
in a set around Christmas time on sale
so for $12 I bought six different lip
colors it was a great deal I'd been
wanting to try this formula out for a
while because I heard a lot of great
things and I think it's okay but it's
still liquid lipstick to me they're not
as amazing as I thought I thought this
was gonna be like my dream liquid
lipstick and it's not like that I just
think in general liquid lipsticks aren't
for me but anyway this is the shade juju
and it's beautiful I loved this set
because it was all very neutral nude
colors things people actually wear and
that's what I wanted from this
collection so that is juju it's looking
a little bit more warm on my monitor but
it is a like cool toned rosy mauve color
the next shade is like a neutral nude
it's the color icon and this one again
is really nice I think this will be more
people's favorite since it's not quite
as rosy as the first one so that is icon
and the last one here is the shade
weekend and it is a more warm toned or
peachy nude like I said these are
comfortable I haven't honestly worn them
long-term to give you a really good
liquid lipstick review I'm not really
the person you want to go to for a
really in-depth liquid lipstick review
but I think these are nice they are more
comfortable on the lips but they're
still a liquid lipstick alright and
these next shades are all that I have
left that's everything those are all my
liquid lipsticks oh shoot I could've
done that I'm cosmetics one separately
but it is what it is we'll just do them
all together again like I said I don't
have a ton of liquid lipsticks it's just
not necessarily my style but let's get
into these in the swatches I'm gonna
start with the end cosmetics one so
these are their like cloud paint lip
creams these remind me of the NYX soft
matte lip creams they are very similar
in formula if you are wondering this is
the shade muted mauve and I do like
these I
finds that again sometimes it can be a
little streaky because they're not going
to be super opaque so as long as you
don't build them up I think that they
are nice and I feel like that's kind of
similar to the Knicks ones as well so
that's muted mauve really pretty like
classic rosy color and then the other
shade that I bought is Spanish earth and
this is a Reddy brown dark lip color
this one's a little bit more difficult
because of the fact that it's so dark
but it also you know is a bit sheer it
can look a little streaky so you just
have to be a little bit careful with it
but I still do like it it's just not a
perfect formula to me next I have a
two-faced melted lipstick this is in the
shade melted fuchsia and I think this is
discontinued or being discontinued I
think you can maybe get it on the Too
Faced website I love this because it is
so freakin bright pink nothing compares
to this color it's beautiful I love it
so much I feel like this is one of the
first liquid lipsticks that came to
market this is not a matte liquid
lipstick it doesn't necessarily dry down
that way I do tend to get a ring around
my lips with this or when I apply it on
anyone so I'd like to use the least
amount of product possible and that
tends to not happen but I love this
color it's so fun and bright it's one of
my favorites next I have a really pretty
dark green liquid lipstick from kiss
this is in the shade wicked forest I
have worn this in quite a few videos I
feel like this with two coats is
completely opaque so I know the swatch
can look a little scary but it builds up
really nicely it's a nice thin formula
it dries down matte it is pretty budge
proof so overall for how I wear this and
how long I wear it I really enjoy it it
makes a look really fun I like pairing
this with like warm matte Browns or
doing like a full-on like cool toned
green blue look speaking of blue
lipsticks this is lime crimes peacock I
bought this probably almost two years
ago now so it's getting a little bit old
it's so weird how this doe foot is so
tiny this is a very liquidy runny
formula it's so different than any of
the ones I have swatch too far I mean
the pigmentation is there it is a nice
formula for a liquid lipstick I don't
buy from Lime Crime
moment I'm not even trying to like
boycott it's just not a brand I really
want to support even though their stuff
looks really cool and that's just my
personal decision but anyway I think
this color is pretty and I'll keep it
until it goes bad but I wouldn't
repurchase it and last for my liquid
lipsticks this is la splashes Katrina
this was a part of a like sugar skull or
something collection I think I really
like this color because it's duochrome
it almost looks like a beetle on the
lips this is a more moosie opaque
formula it's really pretty I don't
really wear it often I bought it because
it was just like so fun and different
but honestly it's not something I get a
ton of use out of so those are the rest
of my liquid lipsticks I'm gonna get
these off my hand before they dry and
then last year kind of like with my lip
glosses I didn't want to show you I have
all of these from covergirl these are
all of the like melting pout ones and
then also some of the major shade Queen
collection ones so I got this in a
Pierre package and obviously this is a
ton of different colors they have a
great range of like nudes and fun colors
like some Purple's some pinks a blue so
we'll be having a lip swatch video on
these hopefully soon but I wanted to
show you these just because they are in
my collection but they aren't in my like
personal collection that again that's
just how I've decided to do it when I
get like massive amounts of stuff not
just like one or two colors it's like
the whole range just so that I can keep
my collection more minimal I do have a
bit of an idea on this formula because I
have tried these out for a little bit
this is a thinner moosie formula it does
kind of go on a bit semi opaque on the
first coat but I do find you can build
it up on a second layer so I enjoy it so
far I think it's comfortable but again
that's coming from someone who doesn't
wear liquid lipsticks all the time it's
definitely not full opacity in one swipe
though but they have been more
comfortable than a lot of other liquid
lipsticks I've tried anyway that's
everything now I hope you guys enjoyed
the video I am going to be finally
moving off of lip products I'm not sure
if I want to go into foundations
concealers face powders or if I want to
go more than route of like color face
products and do highlighters blush and
bronzers so let me know what route you
want me to take but other than that I
will see you in the next video thank you
so much for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
