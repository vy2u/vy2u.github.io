this is their my favorite one
this is benefits Porefessional and I use
about that much it's kind of a lot but
that's what I use to put that all over
my face and I just kind of smooth it on
I don't pat it or anything especially
around my nose and cheeks next for
foundation I'm gonna be using Rimmel's
BB cream this is the matte version I
really like this I've been going for a
more like a simple foundation routine I
had about that much on and again I just
kind of DAB it in the areas I needed
most and this really just makes my skin
tone like so much more even I just like
the way that it the finish of it it just
looks like real skin as you can see it
just kind of evened out everything so
that way
it just looks a natural that you can
still see like different spots
so my chin on my face and stuff but
overall it just looks more finished next
I am going to be using this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer umm this is
in the color fair I'm just doing
anything that right under my eyes I do
carry it down a little bit as you can
see here like down the sides in my face
I do find I have some redness there I'm
gonna take it down the bridge of my nose
a little bit there and then I have been
breaking out around this area
I'm also you can take it there it's kind
of a lot but since I used less there's a
little spot there since I used less
foundation I feel like I can go a little
more hang on concealer and it still
won't look cakey so I'm gonna buff that
in using this Real Techniques flat top
bucket buffing brush sorry my brushes
aren't clean but I'm not gonna clean
them just for this video I just kind of
roughly run that in I do like to put
them in my brows as you can tell I have
no brows I basically draw them in a
hundred percent so I do like to put a
little bit of foundation and concealer
on them and I usually don't go for just
like a hundred percent perfected look
that's just not my style
on the everyday that's what that looks
like after everything and I took the
foundation or the beacon down my neck a
little bit as well just to kind of make
sure it's blended out next we are going
to set our under-eye this is the powder
that I'm using this as a Maybelline fit
me in 1/35 creamy natural this powder I
do not like to use it on my face because
it is just too sparkly it has like
little shimmer particles in it that's
why I think it's just perfect for under
the eyes I'm a powder person I know all
of you are like don't use a lot of
powder I'm like use I do like to use my
fair share of powder do you I mean this
is just how I do my makeup and then to
set the rest of my face I'm gonna use
the Rimmel stay matte powder this is in
transparent 0:01
this one I don't use as much of and I
just let this been the other areas it is
a BB cream so I find that even though
it's the matte one throughout the day it
can kind of wear down and so yeah I just
I said it that's the base makeup a
hundred percent completed I think it
looks pretty good I am going to use this
palette here this is a palette that I
made of just like blushes either they
came depotted or just in the pan form or
i depotted them myself
in here I have this mini sized hoola
bronzer some news that to contour slash
and bronze up my face give it a little
bit of color and to do that I will be
you
this is my favorite brush to do that
what this is the Real Techniques
duo fibre brush this came it's a duo
fibre face brush this came in like that
supposedly lemon Edition which you can
still get its own I don't know how true
that it is but I'm just gonna stuck my
chicken and I just put a little bit in
the hollows of my cheek I'm not super
precise honestly I just want a little
bit of definition in there
I don't contour like hardcore daily but
I do do this every day so I think it
just gives my skin just enough colors I
don't look just like pale eyes all
get-out cuz I'm a super pale girl and
then I'm gonna take a little bit of that
under the jawline and I do move it down
my neck a little as well
I'm going to actually contour my nose
just a little bit it's nothing serious
and to do that I'm also going to be
using another one of the Real Techniques
this is the duo fiber contour brush I
just barely pad that in my bronzer and
then I'm just gonna take it down my nose
and kind of down the tip there it's
again not a super precise contour I just
find I like the way it looks
hopefully that's even that's all I'm
gonna do for bronzer and then today
since I am using the new lorac products
I'm going to be using the blush palette
I'm gonna be using this shade right here
this is matte and I think I'm gonna
deepen it up with that shade toward the
back of my cheeks I'm gonna take that
darker color first and I'm gonna take it
on this duo fibre brush this is the f50
by Sigma to my camera shut off like it
always just that I'm not used to it so I
did already do this is that final
product of
it looks like with both I think I'm even
gonna go in and just to kind of blend it
all minute my powder brushes would have
used to put the Rimmel stay matte powder
on this is just the elf complexion brush
I'm just gonna kind of work that out
let's highlight I'm gonna go back to you
this palette here I'm gonna take this
little mini Clinique and I got this off
of all cosmetics wholesale I have a haul
up about them to you this is just a
clinic mini highlighting thing I'm
mostly dip my brush in the pink and
white side to do that I am gonna take a
fan brush I'm gonna swirl it in there
and I am just going to put that on the
tops of my cheekbones and I kind of
bring it up a little bit next I'm gonna
do my brows this might take a while this
is the Anastasia brow Wiz in the color
dark brown I know that's way too dark
for me but this came in a set from my
brother and my mom so I'm just using it
up I do usually use taupe I feel just
the back portion of my eyebrows in with
this
that's kind of the shape I go for I go
pretty intense ago
so I just felt in that first portion of
them and then I go through and spoolie
them out and then I'm gonna fill it in
the top portion with powder just so that
they look a little bit more natural it's
just gonna distribute the product a
little better since it is so dark for me
I find if I go a little too dark I can
kind of bring it back by spoiling them
thrilled I'm taking this star look squad
I'm gonna take the color that has a ton
of pan on it and I'm gonna take this
like stiff bristle brush I'm gonna fill
in just that top portion Wow
oh my gosh pretty good for eyes we're
gonna be using of course the lorac Gold
palette I'm gonna be taking this color
on the first half of the lid kind of go
in the second half of the lid with that
and then my transition colors and I
might deepen it up just to give you guys
a little bit of a preview but first
before I do that I guess I'm going to
prime my eyes I'm going to be using this
Tarte emphasized cream shadow in the
color Shivering golden beige and I'm
just gonna put that all over my eyeball
eyelid I'm gonna be taking this Sigma
medium angled shading east 70 brush and
I'm going to be putting that into this
color here uninhibited that one there
and we're just gonna be opening that if
focusing it on the first half of my
eyeball and then I'm gonna go into the
shade right next to it this one right
there unpredictable I am going to just
blend that on the second half of the
brush I'm still using I'm sorry the
second half of the lid still using that
same brush and that's I'm going to be
taking this just fluffy blending brush
this is mirabela eye blender brush I got
it in an empty bag and I'm going
taking the lightest brown shade in
undeniable this color here it is more
warm tone as well and then I'm just
gonna be blending that into the crease
making the most product beyond that
outer portion usually I'm like an
everyday basis I might just leave it
there I'm gonna deepen it up just a
little bit so I'm gonna take a pointed
kind of like crease brush I'm gonna go
right into this color here it's on the
top part of the palate and it's like
matte and I'm just gonna put that just
straight into the outermost crease just
to kind of deepen it up I'm just
seriously using the tiniest bit and then
we're gonna go out and blend it out
we're gonna go back in with undeniable
that first lighter brown color and just
make sure that that's nice and blended
so now we are going to go in and
highlight the brow bone I'm gonna use
the undressed color in here that one
there and just put that right under my
brow bone to do that I'm using this
Sigma e60 brush you can't really see
that sorry I do like to go back once
again and blend again you can never
blend too much and then I'm gonna also
highlight my inner corner to do that I
will be using this pencil brush by Sigma
and e30 and I'm gonna be using the color
like here unlocked and this is like a
Goldy kind of white color I'm gonna be
using this just like little angled brush
from Sephora it's called the liner brush
it came that's like really pretty rose
gold travel set and I'm going to be
using that first that brown color that
we used in the crease in undeniable and
I'm gonna be putting that just right at
the lash line
I kind of connect it up I'm also gonna
be doing on to the other side
and then I'm gonna be using this same
brush and I'm gonna go back into that
outer part wait that color we used on
the outer part of the lid and I'm gonna
be putting up all the way up into the
tear duct I just think it all kind of
brighten the look
to blend it all out I'm just gonna be
taking and to bring it down the lash
line just a little bit I'm gonna be
taking this small blending a 25 brush
from Sigma and I'm just gonna put a
little bit of a mixture between the
undressed color we used for the brow
bone and then this color um so it's not
quite as dark now we're just gonna use
some liner I'm going to be using this
Tarte colored clay liner on my tight
line
final step for liner I'm gonna be using
this Stila smudge stick in the color
Oscar fish this is just like a brownie
bronze color now that I have that on
there I'm just going to smudge that out
with my finger I'm gonna be using just
this sample size of the Josie Maran
black oil mascara this is what the wand
looks like it's like the fairy drops one
last but not least our lips I am going
to be using a mixture between this a
buxom dolly pen and also the lipstick
that came with the lorac unzipped cheek
palette just to kind of keep it all the
same that's the lorac one this is in the
color girl next door
that is the final look guys I hope you

super long it's a first one so um we'll
see how it edits out but I think it
looks really good overall I really like
