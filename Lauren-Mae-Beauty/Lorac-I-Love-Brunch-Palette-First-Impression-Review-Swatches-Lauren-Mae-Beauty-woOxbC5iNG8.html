learn I wanted to get this video up
super soon I just got this in the mail
literally last night on Friday it's no
Saturday I wanted to give you my first
impressions some swatches and a bit of a
review I know it's kind of early but I
kind of feel like I have some thoughts
on it and yeah this is a Little Rock Pro
I love brunch palette I was so excited
for this I talked about this in my new
beauty launches video I'll leave a link
down below if you haven't checked it out
I was just super excited about this how
I was ready to love it I love lorac I
have a lot of their palette to have like
all the mega pros I have all the regular
pros I'm into it have the gold the
unzipped like I'm into it you know
first off packaging I think is super
cute I like the like different design
even though it's the same amount of
shadows and a regular Pro palette just
so you know I know it seems like well
duh wouldn't you just know that but
because the shape is different in my
head I thought it was more so when it
was this tiny I was kind of like oh then
I counted the eyeshadow so it's the same
stuff anyway the packaging is really
pretty it's like this holographic I
don't know if it's peculiar it's picking
up and it's cute with the pro I'm into
it I like it just looking at the outside
I'm down it also came with two little
extras this is the brush and I thought
the brush is actually pretty nice it's
pretty soft it has a nice little fluffy
side and then the other side it's like a
little bit of like a fluffier shader
brush I did use this to apply the eye
look I'm wearing today which is from
this palette I know my glasses kind of
hide my look but I just wanted to
actually see in a video today so I'll
take it off that's what it looks like I
did use a couple of the different shades
which I feel like you can't tell though
it looks like I put one shadow
everywhere it doesn't look bad though
right it's cute it's cute I'm down I'm
down with like you know something more
pastel something not as pigmented just
gonna mention in case you didn't watch
my last video I do have a crack in my
glasses but I glued it up and I'm
wearing them anyway because they cute
okay so price-wise this costs 44 dollars
which is expensive I think that's really
expensive I think the lorac palettes
usually go for like 42 so I don't know
why this is more expensive I guess
you're getting a brush maybe that's the
reason I'm still not digging that this
is what the inside looks like super
pretty super pastel and I feel like
immediately
looking at this everyone's like is it
gonna be pigmented and it's really not
it's let's be honest
like let's just we're gonna go there
those are some finger swatches some
light finger swatches of it now I don't
feel like there's enough color
differentiation if that's a word um to
really justify having this palette if
you are a medium skin tone or darker I
don't even think this would show up on
you honestly I don't I really truly
don't
I don't know right like it's pretty and
I get it but I just don't think it's
worth it like I don't it's hard for me
to say that because I want to like it
like I really want to like this palette
and I just can't I just feel like it
looks kind of powdery right I just feel
like I have other shades like this that
it's not worth having like it's just not
worth $44 if this palette was $20 I
maybe could feel better about it or if
they stepped up the pigmentation on each
of these just like up a couple of
notches like keep the pastel theme I
like that that's why I wanted it it's I
get the inspiration with brunch I'm down
I just don't feel like there's enough
pigmentation in here I don't feel like
this should only work on super pale skin
tones the look I did today I used the
brush that came with it that's it I
didn't use anything else and I did use
the primer as well I didn't put down
like a white base or anything so I feel
like you can build these up and make
them work I'll do a couple of like brush
swatches for you I'll also cut two
swatches of everything I don't know
right like it's just too expensive it's
just too expensive to not perform as
well as you really wanted to so it makes
me so sad to say that but I just wanted
to tell you guys how I felt I'm gonna
actually go grab the pastel goth palette
so you guys can see that next to it I
know that's like the other pastel thing
that's out right now so let me grab that
so we can compare them and see
okay so here's pastel goth palette and
here are the colors there's lots of
controversy of whether these are pastels
are not I think they're really pretty
pigmentation wise
I almost felt like these weren't that
pigmented honestly like I wanted a
little bit more from them I can make
them work and I think they're good and
I'm not gonna get rid of it I just
definitely you know was thinking like
these aren't that pigmented but the
pigmentation here totally outweighs the
pigmentation in the lorac palette so if
I was already feeling like that about
this my goodness you know it's just hard
to justify this palette there's a part
of me that for some reason still wants
to keep it like I'm sick in the head I
don't really know why but I probably
should return it honestly I told myself
like when I ordered it if I didn't like
it I would return it let me see if I can
make this not awkward
but it's probably not gonna be awkward
so here they are held up nothing in here
would ever show up to what this is so I
don't feel like they're comparable
really like I definitely think you're
gonna get different looks entirely from
the two and I would prefer this palette
if the pigmentation was there but it's
just not I like the eye look I came out
with today I like that basically you can
never get too dark and deep because I
don't really love a dark eye look on me
I never have like winged liner or
anything like that because I just don't
prefer those types of looks on me but
then these are the those are the colors
like I know it looks better on camera
than it does in real life I'm telling
you right now leap I don't know if you
were really wanting this I probably
think you shouldn't get it like just
don't do it and you'll be happy I feel
like if you get it you're gonna be
disappointed but there's gonna be this
piece of you potentially that wants to
keep it still even though it's crappy
overall I do want to play around with
this a little bit more I've only used it
today so this is definitely a first
impressions type of situation maybe I'll
change my mind but the percentage on
that it's probably 10% out of like 100
that I'll change my mind um I do want to
try something like the purples and the
blues and the mints and stuff and see
how they are even these like neutral
colors that are like mixed in here they
just aren't that amazing the white
shimmer is okay other than that it's
just me I like so badly want to justify
keeping this I just don't think I can so
anyway if you want swatches of this
I'm gonna try to do brush swatches and
finger swatches just so you guys can see
stay tuned
those are coming if I'm just being 100%
real and getting over the cuteness
factor getting over so many things I
have to just mentally I'm looking at
this as quality if this was coming from
a different brand I really don't think I
would be happy with it and I definitely
don't think this will work on so many
skin tones it'll really only work for a
couple people so it's just not worth the
hassle for the price I said it it's true
Lauren get it through your head if I
change my mind though I will let you
guys know but I feel pretty confident
saying like don't get it it's okay to
pass on it like it'll hurt for a second
but in the long run you'll be so happy
you don't have it all right that's
everything for me here I'm gonna show
you guys swatches and let me know what
you guys think down below I would love
to know what you think if you have it if
you really liked it how are you making
it work I feel like there are ways to
make this work but it's just too much
like I shouldn't have to wet my brush or
do all these like crazy things just to
make a regular eye shadow work for a
whole palette like I can see one shade
or two shades but like the entire thing
no so that's everything guys I'll see ya
