Lauren and today I am going to be
showing you the lorac mega pro 3 oh my
gosh the lighting it's so beautiful it's
binding you I think I got it we won't
move the ankle this is the third mega
Pro palette from lorac so this is the
third holiday season that it's come out
and it's absolutely beautiful I just got
this in the mail last night you guys saw
it on my Instagram and people wanted to
see some swatches of it and I definitely
wanted to get swatches up for you guys
to just let you guys have some
ammunition and decide if this is a
pallet for you but I will say you need
it I'm not someone that likes to say
that but I just am in love with this
palette it is so beautiful it's what I'm
wearing on my eyes today I feel like I
bought this palette and I was kind of
like oh I'm gonna get it because I have
the other two and so yeah I'll get this
one too but when it came in the mail
last night and i swatched it I just fell
in love with this I feel like this is
the best of the other two palettes all
put together I love how it has so many
great transition colors in just slightly
different tones I love the dusty Maas I
love these like more pink or cranberry
type of colors burgundy colors and then
again more great transitions cool warm
all of it the shimmery colors at the
bottom are also just so beautiful I'm
just obsessed I'm so obsessive it on my
eyes today I have on rose quartz all
over the lid and then I kind of used a
ton of the different matte shades to do
my crease work and transition stuff so I
use Tov Etan pecan pecan pecan however
you say it maple and then kind of a mix
of bark and eggplant on the outer corner
I'm just absolutely in love I feel like
out of all the lorac palettes this is
the one you should get even out of the
permanent selection I just feel like for
me at least it's just the perfect
selection of colors I love it I'm so
obsessed I feel like I could use every
single color in here not one of them is
a dud and what I love is none of these
have a glitter in them I feel like in
the first lorac mega Pro there was like
in I don't know what color was I had
like different colored glitter in a
black base not my favorite and even in
the most recent pro 3 just a regular pro
3 there was a glitter
shade in there so I'm just gonna like
leave it at that obviously I haven't
used every color but it's the exact same
formula that you've come to know and
love or maybe not love from lorac I love
their shadow formula so to me this is
just absolutely beautiful and I'm so
happy because again I was just buying
this kind of as the collector as someone
I knew I would like it but I am just
like obsessed I can see myself using
this every day if you love like warm
shadows or even some cool though again
it's not all warm shadows but this
obsessed I do suggest this one over the
calves on d1 if you are more of a
neutral person you definitely can get a
few pops of colors like they shade
pomegranate in here that's really the
only like pop of color everything else
is very neutral unlike just a little bit
of a variation off of neutral so if you
want neutrals go for this for sure if
you like just eyeshadow go for this for
sure basically get this it's limited
edition and I feel like it's the best
one I am gonna do some comparisons
though since i have all of the lorac Pro
palette will start off comparing it to
the mega Pro 1 this is probably my
second favorite mine's pretty beat up so
I apologize for not looking pristine so
this is both of the palettes held up
it's like really weird for me so I'm
sorry I'm like smash in the middle like
family portrait these are the two
different ones it's kind of hard to tell
the colors because color is dependent on
the colors that surround it how it looks
so I wish that the back of the palettes
we're the same color so you can get a
better idea of the differences I feel
like the new palette this palette
definitely has a lot of those warm
shades and like that dusty mauve kind of
tones coming from this one this one's
great obviously there was like a whole
fiasco with it but I do like this one
better so that's just the comparison
just let you know and now let's compare
it with the second mega Pro this one I
feel like is definitely different from
it this one definitely has way more pops
of color I feel like it's overall a bit
more cool toned it's still a beautiful
palette and I loved it but I just feel
like every day this is like my everyday
palette it's so good anyway that's what
they look like compared the biggest
difference I feel like in this one past
those other two
as well is the fact that this one
doesn't have a mini light shimmery
shades it has snow which snow is in the
lorac pro 2 palette and i love that
color has an inner corner highlight it's
what I'm wearing today but it really
just doesn't have a bunch of like the
opal and you know those same variations
of really really light shimmery shades
it kind of has that stark white goes to
like a couple light shades and then goes
into mid-tones and I think it's just
perfect for that because I personally
don't always want just like a really
stark light shade on the lid anymore it
was something I used to like but I've
kind of moved on I like something a
little more intense especially for fall
especially for holiday I really like the
way that they put this palette together
how much can i rave about this palette
seriously I was not expecting this
that's like what's the best part about
it I figured I would also compare it to
the three other pro palettes
these ones are not limited edition so
you can go pick them up at Ulta anytime
you want the first one here this is the
lorac Pro and again this is it held up
with the mega pro so I'm just showing
you I just thought I would show you guys
just you know if you have everything and
you're trying really hard not to buy
stuff I guess you don't need it I just
figured since this is limited edition I
would go for this over going for
something like this it's too big of a
palette and here's a comparison of the
lorac pro 2 with the new mega pro 3 and
again like I mentioned the color snow is
the same in here I didn't notice off the
back anything else being exactly the
same that was the only color that I was
like that's the exact same name like the
exact same stitch but yeah I'm really
happy about that because I've already
hit pan on my snow in this palette it's
been one of my favorite go to inner
corner highlight shades this whole year
so I'm not complaining and then I
specifically had a request to compare it
to the lorac pro 3 if you're just
glancing at it I do feel like these are
the most similar palettes to each other
out of all of the collection these are
definitely more beige I feel like this
is the best like everyday kind of
neutral palette out of all of the
permanent selection the same way I feel
like this is the best overall everyday
palette for the mega pros so there they
are
if I had to sit dress
I would get this one over this just
because again this is limited edition
you're getting so many more shades I
just feel like you can always pick this
up later if you feel like you need it
but you can't do that with this one so I
just feel like this one's a better bang
for your buck I also want to point out
that there's a color in here called
medallion and it's one of those really
like flaky it's just not the same as
their other shadows so I just I don't
like that shade and the mega Pro doesn't
have a shape like that so it's just like
mm I just wish it didn't have that shade
so and these ones to me are more like
neutral toned I mean there are some
warmer colors but these are all very
neutral to me like beige II neutral and
these kind of lean a little bit more
warm a little bit more like rosy or just
have something else to them so again
these are probably my two favorite ones
now that they're here but I wonder if
that's because of the most recent and
they're the most on trend with what
people are liking now as opposed to when
the first palette came out so anyway I
wanted to show those up next to each
other I mean this is a beautiful palette
though this is a great everyday I just
feel like sense this is limited edition
I think it's worth it and you can always
pick this up later I hope that the
comparisons helped in some way I just
thought since I happen to have all of
them that it would be kind of fun to
show you guys obviously I super love
this palette and I suggested but I will
get into swatches now so that way you
guys can make up your mind and decide if
this is a palette for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
