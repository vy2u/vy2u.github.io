Lauren thank you so much for watching I
am doing another tube talk today I will
leave the playlist linked down below but
if you haven't seen any of these videos
before this is a series I started on my
channel to talk about just different
topics whether it's about the beauty
community or just things that I want to
bring up and talk about its supposed to
be just off the cuff so a lot of the
times I'm not super prepared with like
notes or I'm not necessarily super
politically correct so it's just
supposed to open up a dialogue and open
up some conversation about different
topics today is something that I just
just thinking about and I realized that
this is never like really talked about
in makeup community and I think it
should be it's something that I am
coming to terms with more and more as I
am out of it but that is a makeup
addiction and that is real I do have
some notes today so I will be
periodically looking at these just to
kind of keep this conversation on track
and I just didn't want to forget
anything that I thought was really
important but I really think that makeup
addiction is a real thing I definitely
used to be addicted to buying makeup and
buying all the new releases and I don't
mean that in like the light handed sense
of like oh I'm addicted I'm obsessed I'm
this I think a lot of the times it can
be kind of thrown off that way and but
it kind of made to be funny but the
reality of it isn't funny and it's not
cute and it's not cool so yeah I don't
know I'm going to talk about my story by
no means if you love a lot of makeup
does that make you a makeup addict you
can do whatever you want with your own
money what are the disclaimers should I
throw out there right now I don't know
you can collect makeup if you want to
these are just my thoughts in my
experience and everyone's different and
everyone's like feelings and emotions
and how they connect with makeup is
different so that doesn't mean that
whatever I'm saying is applying to you
I'm just kind of speaking my mind right
now so I think that's enough of a
disclaimer we'll start off with my story
I was never really that into makeup I
was in theatre and even in theatre I
wasn't in the makeup department really
um I had like a couple products when I
was in high school I always wore like
mascara some eye shadow a little bit of
foundation and that's really it like I
didn't have a lot of stuff then one day
I stumbled upon YouTube Beauty videos I
don't even remember when it was but it
has to be
at least like six years ago now I've
been making videos it'll be three years
in February of next year I don't know I
always think of February that's like
when I started uploading so I know I was
watching videos per probably a good
three years before I started filming
them myself and the entire world just
sucked me in I thought it was so cool I
loved seeing people do makeup it was so
foreign
obviously it's beautiful it's the beauty
industry it's you know makeup and so I
started buying things I I've always had
a job I've had a job since I was
seventeen so I had a little bit of extra
cash in whatever I had I would spend on
makeup I always had packages coming to
the house and for a long time it was
just like buying when I could it wasn't
like super intense you know no addiction
starts out like insane at the beginning
I just bought when I could I spent all
my extra money on it I just loved it I
was super enthusiastic I remember when I
found out what an eyeshadow primer was I
freaked out because I'd always had
issues with my eyeshadow creasing and I
couldn't believe that there was a
product that like was meant to stop that
and it worked I was like what is this
sorcery so it was all good fine and
dandy I loved it at the beginning and it
was great then like fast forward
probably toward the end before I started
kind of getting into the project panning
community before Sam and I moved to LA
and to California we both had really
good jobs in Arizona we were making a
lot of money especially for what our
bills were we had a lot of extra cash so
I spent so much money on makeup it's
crazy when I think about that money it
makes me cry a little and cringe inside
and also exam cringe because it just was
so much money I was just spending on
makeup all the time I would make super
large purchases I remember anytime there
was a deal I felt like I had to buy
there was 20% off at Sephora or Ulta I
was like all over it and buying like the
apocalypse was about to happen I had to
have every new release I had everything
I loved putting it in my IKEA drawers
like I was full-blown
obsessed with makeup and again
just because
love makeup that much and you're buying
all the new stuff I don't think that
necessarily makes you addicted
especially if you have the money and
you're not like sacrificing other things
but there were some like key things I
feel like for me especially when I look
back that make it like no it was more
than just a love of makeup like I would
I would always have everything sent to
my mom's house because I didn't want
packages showing up at my house and I'm
telling you I probably had like packages
come every single day at least five or
six packages a week we're coming to my
mom's house and I would always I'm
always the type of person that's gonna
buy until you get free shipping so
imagine it it was just so much money oh
so much money and a lot of it Sam knew
about but I definitely used my mom's
house as a way to kind of hide a lot of
the makeup I was bringing in it's not
that he didn't know about me spending
the money but I just didn't want it like
in his face I didn't want to get
questioned on like why I was buying so
much makeup and I think about that now
and I know that's what I was doing back
then it's just like oh it's not a big
deal whatever you know kind of push it
aside but when I think about it I know
that's the reason I was doing it so
that's like a big red flag for me is
just kind of like hiding it and not
feeling open or proud kind of having
this little part of you that kind of
knows what's up
but just like baring it with more makeup
and then another thing too I have a
couple like instances where I remember
purchasing these pallets and these items
and I think back and I'm like why did I
buy that I remember when the tartlet
palette tarts first tartlet palette came
out it did like a pre-release I believe
on Sephora or on tarts website it was
like a two-day pre-release before they
were gonna sell it on Sephora and I was
like all over it like bought it I was so
excited for it all the stuff and when I
think back I'm like why did I even want
that that much was it because it it's
matte or the colors because those aren't
really my type of colors like I just
wanted it because it was new and I
wanted it because it was like a
pre-release like I wanted it as fast as
possible I wanted it in my collection I
loved watching videos and being able to
like mentally check off be like oh I
have that
I have that yeah it's so good girl
you're right or whatever it's like I'm
almost living this life of a beauty guru
but in my own home and in a totally
different world than them it's crazy
that was one that I really remember like
wow I don't know why I purchased that so
soon it's a permanent item I could still
buy it I can go and buy it at Sephora
today if I wanted to but for but I had
to have it you know before anyone else
could have it I also did that with the
hourglass blush palette the first time
they had that I remember getting it on
Sephora vib Rouge before anyone else
could and I remember wanting it so bad
and wanting to buy it before it sold out
and again it's something that I don't
use a ton in my collection but it's such
an expensive item it's crazy I would
just I wouldn't even bat an eye at some
of these prices because you just get so
used to paying 30 40 50 $60 for things
the other item that I remember wanting
so bad was the NARS narcissus dual
intensity eyeshadow palette the first
time they had one of those I got that
for my birthday I asked for it for my
birthday from Sam and I don't know why I
even wanted that why could I even want
that it would have been so much cheaper
just to get like one eyeshadow of the
collection that I thought would work for
me but instead I hadn't buy an $80.00
palette that I never used anything like
also the narcissus regular palette that
isn't the dual intensity never use that
but had to have it because everyone else
did and I think that's the biggest thing
I kind of had this collector mentality
but there was it was more than just
wanting it it was like all that mattered
was getting it there was like this rush
and almost I want to say hi because
we're we're quoting it to being addicted
and I really think I was addicted to
buying I wanted to purchase I wanted to
feel excited about a package coming I
wanted to have that first item and open
it and touch it and swatch it and use it
a couple times but then after that that
feeling goes away and you have to go and
fill it with something else you need
more stuff so that's why I constantly
had packages coming to my house I
constantly had new stuff nothing ever
satisfied because I needed that constant
like what's new I have to have it it's
coming to me it's here it's brand-new
and
and like to start the cycle over again
now that's just my little story I know
that not everyone feels that way or
maybe you're in that but you love it and
whatever that's fine wherever you are
mentally with what you're doing
um that's totally cool as long as you're
okay with it and you like it that's
what's that's your story and what you
want to do but for me it just became
kind of exhausting and I also feel like
the beauty community has changed a lot
there are so many new releases that it's
not even possible to buy everything
anymore there's so much new stuff coming
out all the time and you know talk about
that a lot of my channel but there
really is there's so much freaking
makeup available if you think of just
color pop releases alone it's insane you
know there came a point where you just
can't keep up with getting everything
anymore also moving to California was a
really big change for me we don't have a
lot of extra money we are out here
trying to live the dream and it's
expensive it's really expensive so I
don't have a ton of extra money to spend
on makeup and that kind of helped me
just not be able to purchase stuff
anymore
along with project panning and
everything so I feel like I'm trying to
keep this organized but it's probably
gonna go all over the place so just stay
with me I feel like the first time I
started to really enjoy using things up
or just getting interested in that type
of attitude was with empties I don't
know why I was just so attracted to
empties it just baffled me that people
were like using things up and actually
trying to use things up I was just
really drawn to the idea of having a
bunch of empty products instead of a
bunch of full products and then at that
time project ten pan was like the thing
it was like a tag you were supposed to
use up ten items before you could
purchase any more makeup and I loved
watching those videos I remember like
searching those videos out and that's
how I came to find the pressure painting
community now before I even started
making videos I was project panning on
my own in my house I'd make little lists
I would tell myself I want to use this
up for the month like I I was all about
project panning even before I was
filming videos about it and then that's
kind of how I started my channel my
first videos I filmed or empties video
and that's kind of where my channel
stemmed from I wanted to you know use up
my makeup kind of control my spending
have an accountability partner or you
know subscribers that were keeping me
accountable to using up my stuff and
although I love project panning I I will
probably project panic all the time like
I just enjoy using things up and trying
to actually finish some things that I
spent my money on but I definitely feel
like even my project panning was was
still this like weird relationship with
makeup it wasn't normal
I'm not trying to offend anyone in the
project panning community because if you
were really hyped and on project panning
I think that's great I'm just talking
about myself here and for me I feel like
I still had this weird relationship with
makeup I was still obsessed but in a
different way I was obsessed with using
things and getting use out of it and
trying to use it this way and you know
having this finished and that finished
by this date and all these things like
like all about numbers all about all
these things and I feel like I was
taking all that energy and those
obsessive thoughts about makeup and just
kind of flipping them and doing a 180
with them but the thoughts were still
obsessive and I was still definitely you
know just weird I kind of want to relate
it to food but it's not nearly as
serious as like food addiction or weird
relationships with food but just because
you aren't like binging doesn't mean
that you don't have issues with food you
know what I'm saying I don't know I hope
that wasn't too controversial but to me
it's a good way to like understand it's
like it's still messed up so anyway
another thing with project painting too
is that you feel guilty when you do buy
stuff it's like the thing is we all love
makeup that's all why we're in the
beauty community that's why we even have
these huge collections that we do have
and there are new releases and some of
them will fit you they'll be perfect for
you you will love every color you'll get
so much use out of it and you'll bring
so much joy into your life but when
you're really deep in the project
panning community it's almost like you
can't buy anything or you feel guilty
you have to say why you bought something
and really justify it and you know I
feel like almost apologize for buying
something even though you shouldn't
necessarily especially if you have good
reasons and you really wanted something
like it's okay
and I think the more that I've done
project panning and again just kind of
growing and getting away from both of
those attitudes I'm finally in a place
where I am just kind of neutral like I
love makeup and I love new stuff I love
talking about it hello my whole channel
is beauty related I'm a makeup artist
like that's what I make my money it's my
career so yeah I love makeup but I'm not
just as obsessed with everything there
are other things in life there are other
things to spend my money on
I don't feel super compulsive either way
when it comes to using things up or
buying things I am I'm just kind of in
the middle if I want something I try to
do all the research I can I try to make
sure it's something I'll actually really
like and it's not something that I have
similar in my collection and if it's
something I really like I purchase it I
also really like going through my
collection and decluttering things I
just don't have as much attachment to
makeup I think a lot of people think
there's like a cycle with like buying
and then two cluttering and buying and
de cluttering and there kind of is and
depending on again where you are
mentally and everyone's different but
for me by you declaring isn't a bad
thing necessarily because you know there
are new trends there are new products
and if I wanted to try something and I
don't like it as much as I used to or
like other things better it's okay to
let those products go instead of
hoarding them or wanting to not get rid
of them because I spent money on them I
feel like constantly going through your
collection and declutter and having a
really specific eye on products that you
like and products that you don't really
like or want to give new homes to
doesn't mean you're in this cycle I
think it I think for me it means that I
am like less attached to my makeup it's
okay to let something go if I really
wanted it I could go buy it again if I
really wanted to so so that's kind of my
run-through of what I consider makeup
addiction obviously it's not like I got
diagnosed I don't even know if that's
like a thing but I definitely think
there is a big addiction to shopping and
instant gratification and the constant
consumerism that is pushed just in the
world and especially in America but then
in general the beauty community is such
a large factor I think there is a reason
that so many people in the beauty
community have the exact same story as
me
it's not like I'm alone over here I know
that there are other people I was not
the only one abducted by the beauty
spaceship and I think that because it's
such a big byproduct of the beauty
community I don't know why it's not
talked about more it's definitely just
kind of brushed aside as like a funny
thing what it's real it's super real and
again I know a lot of people collect
makeup and if you want to collect makeup
that's up to you
I know like for example Tara babies I
really like her she has a ton of money
to buy the makeup first off and also she
is a collector of makeup you know she is
she's not gonna use old products on
herself she will she doesn't seem to
have like an attachment like that of
like wanting to keep things and use them
she's totally finds like getting rid of
it if it's expired but she just likes
collecting makeup that's her thing and I
feel like that's a lot different than a
lot of other people I feel like a lot of
people hold onto makeup still want to
use makeup that's like entirely too old
I'm not talking about an eyeshadow
palette that's like 2 years old I'm
talking about makeup that's like 8 plus
years old here people it just seems a
little odd in my head to collect items
that decay over time to me collections
that I admire and like are things that
you can buy and gain value over time or
at least just don't decrease in value
and they and they literally don't decay
makeup goes bad and spoils so unless
you're like the one person who wants to
collect makeup and have something like
think of makeup that we have now from
the 1920s that is really cool stuff but
I know a lot of us aren't doing that and
there are so many cosmetics nowadays
that it's just kind of like ok I just
feel like the percentage of people that
are gonna be doing that and are that
hardcore and are about that actually is
very very small so I don't like to look
at my makeup as like a collection in
that way where I just want to accumulate
more and more it's something I want to
use and go through and then add to and
get rid of it's a constant like
breathing thing it shouldn't just be
constantly growing up and up for me
let's see I'm checking out
notes because I feel like I'm going off
here I guess back to the beauty
community and I just think it's sad that
this isn't talked about more in actual
thing and that more bigger beauty gurus
aren't just a little bit more mindful
like I know it's their job and I think
that's so cool I would love it if it was
my job to like talk about new releases
but I think there's like maybe a bit of
a smarter way that we can do it without
it just being like by this it's awesome
or whatever I also think that because
beauty gurus get sent so much makeup
it's easier for them to just be like
this and that and this and that and on
top of that they make a lot of money so
even if they want to purchase all this
stuff they definitely can but there are
a lot of people out there who don't have
the money but are buying a lot of makeup
and again everyone's finances are their
own but I definitely think that point
you constantly are raving about tons of
different products and you keep pushing
a lot of this like consumerism and just
buying new stuff to buy new stuff you're
never going back to the old favourite
like two months ago even though we all
bought it um I just oh it just makes me
feel icky I just don't think that's so
good I don't think it's good you know
then I think there's even for smaller
beauty creators who maybe don't get sent
a lot of PR I think a lot of times we
can justify buying a lot of makeup
because it's for our channel I know that
I kind of feel like I would do that or
you know you want to try out this
formula well this formula is different I
want to try it out and it is good to try
out different things it's fun and I
don't want to take away any of the fun
that is makeup because makeup is fun I
love it
but there's just there's just a
difference I hope you guys can like just
know what I'm talking about here but
there's a difference between trying a
new lipstick and then buying every
single color of a certain line of
lipsticks like that's different and then
having that times ten over in your
collection that is such a different
thing to me anyway I think I want to
leave this video mostly here I think the
biggest thing for me is that I really
don't have that same attachment to
makeup that a used to I still love it I
use it for my job but I'm not just so
obsessed with it and it doesn't just
like this feeling doesn't come over me
when something new comes out where I
just want to go to the website and buy
the media
and that used to be me I used to not
even think about it I just put in my
cart purchase it done it's coming to me
can't wait I definitely take my time now
if things aren't limited-edition I take
a lot more time on it I wait for reviews
to come out I look through my collection
and see if there are similar items and
if I would like that product better I
might watch it in store and something
else too is I just don't spend all my
extra money on makeup anymore I've come
to realize that I need other things in
my life like clothing
I need to buy new clothes and I can't
spend every last dime of my extra money
on makeup I also have been valuing other
things besides like touching things what
am I trying to say I'm valuing things
other than material items I really am
enjoying experiences so instead of
buying a really expensive pallet think
about what you could buy with that like
when I think about the hundreds of
dollars I would spend a month it's like
I could go to a Broadway musical I could
take a plane ticket and go somewhere for
the weekend there are so many things you
could do and you would have this
experience for life instead of makeup
that you don't even touch in your
collection that's the thing that guides
me and I hope that that comes across on
my channel I think it does but um even
when I get new things I never want you
guys to feel like I'm trying to push you
with new products or PR or just anything
I'm talking about when it comes to
beauty it's never to incite you to go
buy it and purchase it and start a
frenzy it's supposed to just give you
information and my thoughts and then you
guys can take those and do what you want
with them if you want to purchase
something than awesome if not it
hopefully just helped you make a better
decision whether that's to shop your own
stash or get something else that you
might like so last if you were someone
who maybe is struggling with buying a
lot of makeup I do want to suggest a
reddit group for you it's called makeup
rehab I think that's what it is I don't
really read a lot on there because it's
not not that it's boring
um but it's it's just not I'm not at
that stage anymore
but if you're really trying to stay away
from like watching a ton of people or
like triggers or whatever I would check
out that reddit if you're into that type
of thing that might be able to help you
or a resource for you yeah I don't know
you can also get like professional help
or anything if you really want to or if
you really feel like that's like it's a
big problem in your life or it's you
know you're making destructive decisions
because of it I don't feel like it ever
got quite to that stage where I was
making really destructive decisions I
feel like I found the project pinning
community and enough time to stop myself
from doing that but I will say there are
times when you know I put things on my
credit card when I shouldn't of and yeah
it doesn't feel good it definitely
looking back it's like for something
that's not food water shelter or an
experience even I got that so I think
this video is winding down I hope you
guys enjoyed this topic I'd love to hear
your thoughts down below and what you
guys feel about makeup addiction I know
that sounds just so intense but I really
think that it is more intense than we
like to call it I think it really is an
addiction so um okay thank you guys so
much I will see you in the next video
and I'm gonna leave a couple other tube
talk topics down below and let me know
what you guys want to see next I want to
do stuff you guys want to see also view
any suggestions for any content on my
channel I would love to hear them I want
to create stuff you guys want to watch
along with just things that I think are
cool so thank you bye I will stop
talking now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
