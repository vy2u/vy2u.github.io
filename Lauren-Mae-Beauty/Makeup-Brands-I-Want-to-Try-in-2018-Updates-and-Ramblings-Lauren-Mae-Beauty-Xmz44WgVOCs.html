Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're in a new location we are all
Christmas up I'm so excited I did not
put up Christmas decorations last year I
just I just was so overwhelmed I was
really busy with work and we go back
home for Christmas but this year me and
Sam had a day off together and we
decided to put up Christmas decorations
so I'm so happy I think this is so cute
and so fun I'm gonna have kind of long
intro right now just like a rambling
little situation because like
that's going down in LA we're on fire
like literally it looks like we are like
hell is breaking loose on the 405 so um
yeah it's crazy and that's part of the
reason I'm even filming today cuz I the
fire started yesterday and that's kind
of like when all the fires are happening
and everything and there was like ash on
my car and all that like I'm safe don't
get me wrong at least for now my gosh
who knows what might just spring up on
the hill we live on so anyway there was
Ash and everything and it was just like
more up in the valley it was like by the
5 and stuff so I mean I I knew it was
like kind of close but not really and
then I gave an Instagram today and
there's like footage of people who were
driving on the 405 left by the Getty
Center and it literally looks like lava
like it's crazy
so um I just like got really freaked out
and I'm like hopefully Sam can get back
over the hill by the time I hope they
can contain the fire enough that he can
get over the hill because he usually
takes like cold water after Mulholland
anyway um we're fine I'm not trying to
be dramatic but it's very insane I mean
not just like sprung up out of nowhere I
like this morning so yeah so I just hope
everyone if you live in LA I hope you're
safe I hope you prepare I'm I'm a little
like nervous honestly and I'm gonna have
like a to-go bag ready to go just in
case we have to evacuate we live in why
I said I want to tell you exactly where
to live hello but we do live against the
mountain so yeah I don't know it's a
potential I mean it's not like
necessarily right up at our front door
but because that fire just from about an
hour I feel like there is a lot of
potential there'll be a timestamp
because I'm gonna finish talking about
Christmas and then we'll get into the
video
sorry guys so I hope everyone's safe if
you are not the LA area you know like be
prepared I hope you're safe I hope your
family and friends and dogs and like
belongings are safe
the firefighters everything it's crazy
anyway back to Christmas we actually
decorated for Christmas this year which
makes me so excited I do have a video
all about my ornaments I'm gonna leave
that link down below if you want to
check it out because me and Sam do
collect ornaments so most of what's back
there are all things that we've gotten
from like on our trips we've gone to
like Paris twice and different things we
always like to get an ornament whenever
we go on a trip or something so we have
memories as we're like decorating the
tree the gift for our guests at our
wedding oh that was so hard to say we're
ornaments because again I love ornaments
and we got married in November so it's
really close to Christmas and anyway so
yeah if you want to check that video out
I will leave it link down below I might
end up filming in a couple different
locations for Christmas because I have a
few other decorations that I want to
feature it's kind of like my style is
like kind of like dive bar Christmas is
one can't Sam I've called it because
it's kind of like I don't know it
succeeding but cool and like I don't
know
it looks really pretty from this angle I
like with that blur on it mmm
the filming okay I am feeling quite a
few videos today I did not film a
tutorial for this look I'm sorry I was
just playing around with makeup and
sometimes you just want to play around
without being on camera but I do want to
like as many video uses out of it as
possible because I really like how it
turned out I have four videos that I'm
gonna film today they're all super duper
fun topics I'm like super inspired with
like video ideas at the moment I feel
like there's just not enough time in the
day for me to film everything that I
want to so I'm gonna be trying to get on
that I'm probably gonna pre-record a lot
just so that I have the footage and then
I can just be like hopefully daily
uploading again okay
that's enough of that let's get into
this actual video my goodness I just
sometimes I just want to talk to you
guys you know since it's Christmas and
we're getting to the end of the year I
thought that talking about the brand's I
want to try and 2018 would be a great
idea I also believe that Samantha March
did a video like this so I will leave
her channel as well as that video linked
down below if you want to check it out I
just really was inspired by that and
there are so many brands that I wanted
to try this year and I haven't and I
thought if I put them in a video I would
be more apt to actually try them next
year so these are the brands that I am
interested in trying that I don't think
I've tried anything from these brands
ever so super exciting stuff let's just
get into it the first brand that I want
to try a sugar pill
they've been on my list for a very long
time when I was at IMATS this last year
I was working at the friends booth and
their booth was right across from ours
so I saw shrinko and I saw like all
their stuff I went over and tried and
like swatch some of their products and I
just loved everything about the brand I
love how bright and fun it is
I love the marketing I just I love
everything so I really want to try some
products from them one of the things
that I really want to try is the pigment
in lumi it's just like an iridescent
really pretty color they have a new one
called ghosted that I've been wanting to
try as well they do the like pro pan
palette now which is really cool there's
just so much to try from them but I
definitely think I would focus on the
eyeshadows as well as the pigments I
think that's like more what they're
known for although they do have their
lipsticks and fun colors yeah so I'm
we really want to try some sugarpill
stuff the next friend that i want to try
in 2018 is knobloch cosmetics - here's
someone that i believe i heard of them
first from jay kissa i will leave her
channel linked as well she talks about
there's a new eyeshadow palette from
them i will leave a picture of it on the
screen but she loves that eyeshadow
palette she also loves the blushes from
them so I really want to try out their
products I've only heard good things
from them I believe they're pretty
reasonable when it comes to pricing so
that's also a great thing and they're
definitely on my list I'm not sure if
I'm going to pick up the palette only
because I don't know I'd rather pick up
singles and then I can incorporate them
into my lid stupid series and all the
different single shadow videos that I do
so that is definitely a brand that I am
looking out for and so excited to try in
2018 it's so weird to say 2018 I have
four more brands to talk about it's not
like a ton of brands I just these ones
I'm super pumped to try so the next
brand is coloured raine colored rain
blew up I remember nikkietutorials
talking about the liquid lipsticks at on
also the Queen of Hearts palette is like
insanely popular now I don't want to try
the Queen of Hearts palette not because
it's not great I'm sure it is I just
have way too many similar shadows in my
collections but I do really want to try
the single shadows I've heard amazing
things from Stefanie Nicole I mean so
many people love the single shadow so I
really want to try those out I don't
think I'm gonna try anything liquid
lipsticks again it's like you guys I'm
an eyeshadow girl like your lips girl or
like a blush girl or an eyeshadow girl
and that is me
I love the eyeshadows so I will for sure
pick up their singles I don't think I'll
pick up any of the palettes but I am
excited to see the reveal of their
newest palette which is like cheers to
the beauties or something like that I
talked about it in a new Beauty launches
quite a while ago so I'm excited to like
finally see the inside of the palette
and see what it's all about the next
brand is probably one that I'm the most
excited to try and that is no Ava zoeva
zoeva however you say it they are very
similar to me to like Sigma they have
brushes and then they also have makeup
but they're uk-based and the brushes
just look absolutely amazing I feel like
they're in the medium price range so
they're not super cheap they're not like
Coastal Scents prices or more feat
prices but they aren't like insanely
expensive
is either so I really want to try their
brushes I really want to try their
eyeshadow palettes I've seen so many
beautiful color combinations I feel like
they actually do interesting things that
are actually inspired like I just I
really like what I've seen when it comes
to the palettes so I really really want
to try their brand out I think that
they're gonna have some awesome quality
stuff I've heard cat front kitchen itch
or you probably know her from Beauty
news she talks about they're like more
neutral palettes and she really likes
those so I am excited to try them sorry
about that Sam was calling and I didn't
want to refilm the whole last portion so
two brands left the next brand is
something I've talked about it's been on
my wish list for a long time and that
dubious place I really want this - Heron
Saharan I don't know why I can't frickin
say that word I don't know it's cuz I
want to say Sahara Desert the Saharan
the Saharan palette it's a horrid you
guys something about me I feel like I'm
quite intelligent but I cannot pronounce
things and I cannot spell for crap I was
story time so I was in eighth grade and
to go to high school you took like a
test and they made you say these fake
words they're fake spoink is one of them
I have a memory of spoink being one of
the words and I did horrible at
pronouncing these words because one
they're not freaking real okay and two
I'm just not strong when it comes to I
guess the phonetics and spelling of
things and the sounding out and sang of
things and so I was placed in block 2
linguistics
which meant that I took two classes of
English essentially my freshman year of
high school and so like we literally
learned like ch it makes three different
noises cut shut and shut I think those
are the three of eggs oh my gosh I
should know um but anyway like
definitely shouldn't have been in the
class but of course I should have been
in AP or like advanced English but I
wasn't I was in blocked linguistics and
so in that class I like totally excel
but that was like the star of the show
man anyway I still and not I just not
strong at pronouncing things so there's
a little backstory on me and that so
anyway Juvia place I want to try out
some of the palates I actually want to
try some of the brush sets as well
stephanie nicole has also raved about
those I believe she really likes those
so I just really want some new brushes I
just got some from ELF and I really like
those so I just like kind of wanna get
rid of my old brushes and just kind of
like bring in some new ones that are
just nice quality I'm even if they're
inexpensive like I'm totally done with
some inexpensive makeup but just having
some new things to my collection and
just getting rid of the old stuff that
I'm holding on to just like have anyway
I totally want to try Julia's place I've
only heard great things I love how they
have so much pigmentation I love the
price point I love the color
combinations and they say that already
um yeah I'm really liking their stuff
and I really want to try to get it on a
good discount they always have a sale
and then you can use coupon codes on top
of that I mean they're gonna do that or
wait for it to go on HauteLook I think
that's also a really good way to get it
at a good discount in the last brand
that I want to try in 2018 is glossy a I
have been wanting to try glossy a for a
while now I heard Jack and Levine talk
about them she really likes a lot of
their products and I just really like
the whole vibe of the brand it's very
like cool girl simple makeup like really
glowy skin not too done up it's kind of
like milk makeup so they're very similar
to me I think about them very similarly
I really want to try some of the cloud
paints I want to try the skin tint the
concealer the brow boy is that what it's
called yeah boy brow boy brow I really
want to try boy brow from them
yeah and I really want to try their skin
care stuff too so just I want to try so
much from them they have like bundle
packs which I think are really
reasonably priced as well I mean they're
not like insanely cheap but they're
definitely not like high-end prices so
that is something I want to try in 2018
those are all the brands I want to test
out I am so excited for 2018 2017 has
gone by so fast
and I'm ready for 2018 I'm so excited me
and Sam are ready to continue the hustle
here in LA
and I'm excited too because I'm going to
be doing kind of like a a year-end recap
as well as kind of like what my goals
are for the next year I don't know if I
should make those two separate videos or
if that's like too crazy but I love
making those types of videos I love just
like talking obviously I'm like a talker
guys I can't wait to do some tube talks
I have like quite a few that I have
written down so I'm excited this is kind
of like an update and brands I want to
use a 20-18
actually I'm gonna read you guys off the
tube talks so you actually tell me what
your favorites are okay so these are my
ideas so one of them is a tube talk
called why all the drama I've had this
idea for a really long time it's
basically like talking about why drama
channels are successful why videos that
are negative or are like filled with
drama get the most views it's like I
feel like I hear people complain all the
time about drama and yet that's what's
successful so kind of just getting into
that conversation ooh
the next one is when small creators
become big I think one of the things
that I hear all the time is like I only
watch small creators or I like small
creators the big creators are bad and
achieve a certain extent I also unlike
that I really do enjoy usually smaller
creators or just like people that aren't
like definitely over a million but you
know as the trend of that happens these
smaller creators including myself I've
seen a huge increase in my own
subscribers we start getting bigger and
so what happens then what happens when
the small craters that used to love
become big creators and just kind of
talking about that next just a tube talk
on my thoughts on morphe I don't know
that was kind of basic I'll probably put
that off for a while and then I have a
tube top called influencers and makeup
lines talking about everyone and their
makeup lines and then the other one that
I want to do is a tube talk on this
article that I have from the 1950s
it's housekeeping magazine and it's
about the Good Wife in the role they
should play so this doesn't have to do
with beauty it's just like I'm talking
about this and we have it like
photocopied and I just wanted to like
read that article and talk about it and
talk about just like all the things that
come up with that article because it is
sexist and it's still of its time for
sure and yeah I would love to talk about
that too so I mean I'll probably do all
of them but like if you have one you
really like maybe leave it down below
and I can know which one you guys want
to see the most I think that's enough
for this video I'm gonna go but
definitely leave the brand's you want to
try out in 2018 if there's something
that I missed these were just the ones
that I could come up off the top of my
head and basically you know I know I've
been wanting to try for a while but I
would love to know what brands are
interesting you and maybe there's
something that I want to try it as well
so thank you guys so so much for
watching I will see you in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
