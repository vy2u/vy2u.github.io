Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing it declutter
and we're gonna be decluttering my
brushes I have a lot of brushes I have
like four of these like just full of
brushes and it's just becoming a little
bit too much I need to go through them
so I thought I would do that with you
guys instead of just doing it on my own
I'm gonna try to get it down so that I
can have my stuff in like two different
cups instead of four we'll see how that
works I like having a lot of brushes
because then I don't have to wash them
as much and some are just good for
different things and I'm in different
mood so I'm not trying to just
completely get rid of everything but I
really do want to get rid of just the
miscellaneous the things I don't use the
things I'm just holding onto for
whatever reason and just passes on to a
better home so that other people can
hopefully use them maybe their routines
will make them work better I don't know
not all my brushes are washed just to
warn you so some of them are really
dirty I'm gonna wash them obviously
before I get rid of them but yeah I hope
you guys enjoy I hope it will maybe
inspire you to let go of some of the
brushes you have in your collection that
maybe are just hanging around you just
have them just in case but you never use
them
pigeon get rid of them send them to
someone like lighten your load that's
how I feel also if you want to know my
favorite brushes I'm gonna leave the
video link down below I have a whole
video dedicated to brushes what I use
them for how I use them it's kind of
long video it's pretty in-depth so check
that out and other than that let's get
into this brush declutter and get rid of
some brushes alright so like I told you
I have four of these different
containers so I think first off I'm
gonna go through and just separate them
by category so try to do like foundation
brushes powder brushes and just kind of
see what piles I get I think it will be
easier to then compare them and see what
I can get rid of and what I have
multiples of so I'm going to do that now
okay so I realized I have a lot of these
types of brushes I'm gonna make this mug
the like get rid of pile over here I
have quite a few of these types of
brushes they're kind of like real
techniques ish I got them about a year
and a half ago or so on eBay for 99
cents for five of them it was like a
crazy deal I put it on my Instagram and
everything but I don't know how many of
these I want to keep oh my gosh this is
crazy
here's three of them I think I can get
rid of this flat top one I honestly feel
like I can get rid of all of them so I'm
gonna get rid of all those along with
that thing I'm gonna get rid of this
like buffing brush from Real Techniques
it's just a little too tiny for me I'm
just ready to let go of it I've had this
for years and years it was great and I
used it a ton but it's time to go I
think I might keep this one though I
like that it has the rounder edge
instead of like a flat edge and I just
like that it's not as dense I feel like
I I just prefer less dense of foundation
pressure so I'm going to keep this one
this is another foundation brush I
really like from RC cosmetics and it'll
have like an angle so I'm gonna keep
that this is another one of my absolute
favorites it's the one I use most of the
time it's the Sigma 3d HD max kabuki
brush I'm gonna keep that I have two
different like stippling brushes and I
think I'm just gonna keep the eda and
minerals one I like this cuz it's denser
than the elf one this one's just a
little too flimsy for me so I'm gonna
pass it on it's a good brush it's just
I'm not using it this is one from Sonia
Kashuk and I've kept it because it's an
interesting shape and something
different for my collection but honestly
I never use this it's just not something
I use so I'm gonna get rid of that I'm
gonna keep this big powder brush this is
something I rarely use but I don't want
to get rid of it in case I want to go
back to this or something so I'm gonna
keep this one big fluffy powder brush
this is a brush from Real Techniques
that I really enjoyed when I first got
it I got this off of octave Lee and it's
great it's the point L brush it comes to
a point you can do a lot of different
things with it I think I like did five
different things using this so I will
leave that video link
if you want to check it out it's a
little bit older but I just don't use it
anymore it's a little bit dense it's
still great I just want to pass this on
to someone else because they might as
well use it and enjoy it and I don't
another foundation brush and I am going
to be keeping this is the Sigma flat
kabuki SAT I really like this so keep
that I have these two brushes they're
basically the same
one is the ELF powder brush and one is
from Coastal Scents it's in the majestic
brush set I mean they literally feel
exactly the same so I do want to keep
one I think I'm gonna keep the Coastal
Scents one just because it's newer and
I'll pass on the elf one I used to use
this all the time to pack on powder on
my face but I don't do that anymore but
I do think it's a handy brush to have
this is an elf brush that I never use
it's very similar to the royal and
langnickel one that we got in the
boxycharm
for February I believe I used to use it
for highlighter but I don't anymore so
I'm going to pass that on this is one of
my all-time favorite brushes from ELF
it's their blush brush but I use it for
powder and it's great so highly suggest
it super nice these brushes are pretty
similar ones from ELF and one is from
Sigma but I think I'm gonna keep both
because one smaller ones bigger and I do
enjoy them this is another elf brush
it's the foundation blurring brush I
think it's nice
there's nothing wrong with it I just
don't use it and I have all those other
foundation brushes something to pass
that on this is one I really hate this
is the pure I don't know foundation
brush it came with the foundation the
perfecting one I got it off of octa Lee
from pure and I just don't prefer these
types of brushes I just don't get them
they don't work well for me this feels
so soft but I never can really blend my
foundation in well so I'm gonna just
stop stop trying and stop pretending
with this and pass it on this is another
one very similar to the Coastal Scents
it's just a little bit smaller but I
think I mean it's so soft this is from a
doe color set that got sent to me and I
think for the price they're really nice
brushes but I think I'm gonna pass this
one on just because I have a similar
brush already I love these two brushes
so I definitely want to keep them once
Coastal Scents ones from ELF this is an
elf brush that I tried out and I wanted
to give it a try because it's just so
interesting it's pretty dense and I
think the best application for this
brush is like doing something I don't
know I can't even tell you I was
honestly gonna say doing something with
moisturizer or skincare or something but
I don't need a brush for that something
to pass it on okay you guys this is like
fuller brushes already so that's amazing
I'm really happy with that we're gonna
start filling up another mug this is a
brush from Dalton you can't get it
anymore but it's like a spinning wands
like crazy I actually really do like the
way this applies foundation obviously
it's the only brush I have like this so
I am gonna actually keep this one this
is another RC cosmetics brush and I
don't use this nearly as much as the
other one so I'm going to pass that on
this is a brush from Real Techniques
that I have loved so hard and it pains
me to get rid of it because I really did
love it for so long for bronzer I love
that it's like a pinched ferrule so you
can do like blending as well as more
precise application if you turn to the
side but I think it's time for it to go
because I really never use it
I just prefer a pointed brush like this
now so I'm gonna pass this one on
another big fluffy brush mmm like I want
to keep this one I don't know why it's
so freakin soft I'm going to keep it
alright we're getting down to some nitty
gritty ones I have two brushes here from
AOA these are from the shop missin a
website they're like the dollar makeup
brand I'm going to keep these for now
because I'm testing them out so I can
let you know what's worth it what's not
and so far I really like them especially
for the price I'm going to keep those
this is another brush that is from that
Sonia Kashuk set and I think I'm gonna
get rid of it I really want to keep it
because I love this like interesting
shape but honestly I never use it so I'm
gonna pass that on this is another one
from that doe color set and I like it
but it's just too small for blush for me
like I like something a little bigger so
I'm gonna pass it on this is something
unique to my collection I have a similar
brush from a Nastasia in my kit but
nothing like this in my own collection
so I'm going to keep that this is my
all-time favorite blush brush so I'm
going to keep that
and last I have these two brushes these
are both from a Sephora rose gold set
that I got quite a while ago this brush
is hard for me to get rid of because
they like how small and dense it is if I
want to just like kind of touch up an
area that's a little bit oily or
something I just like the precision of
how tiny it is so I think I might keep
it and this one is also one I just like
it's different than my even minerals one
so I think I'm gonna keep that as well
so yeah these ones I don't know I just
like them
alright so technically all those brushes
that I am keeping fit into one of the
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candle like old jars
this is just a case that goes over the
candle if you guys are wondering but
yeah so I'm happy with that I'm getting
rid of so far these four brushes as well
as this whole container of brushes so
that's great and last I have like a ton
judge eye brushes and a couple face
brushes that didn't really go into the
powder so I'm gonna lay this all out so
I have a lot of eye brushes and yeah
let's just get into it I'm gonna start
with like the bigger brushes and kind of
move down so this is my favorite
highlight brush it's technically the
Real Techniques contour brush I think
you can only get it in the kit highly
suggested though it's my favorite I love
it this is another one from the DOE
colors it's like a bigger highlighter
brush or that's at least how I use it so
I'm going to keep that speaking of a
highlighter brush though this is a fan
brush I do not like it it's too flimsy
don't enjoy this is one from AOA and
honestly I don't really like how flimsy
it is even though it's bigger but I'm
gonna keep it so I can do that review
and then I'll probably declutter it this
is one home color pop that I just got
and this is beefy this is such a beefy
like fan type of brush someone said that
they apply I think their bronzer with
this and I think that'd be really cool
so I obviously I'm gonna keep this I
just bought it and I think it's really
awesome these are some of my like
contour brushes this is like a fake of
the NARS eita brush I believe so it's
just scratchy and not very good I'm
gonna get rid of that one this is one I
got off of ebay a long time ago it's
soft but not something I like to wear or
use it just gives me too harsh of a line
and
I'm not really even not into contouring
technically really so I'm gonna get rid
of that this is one from Smashbox that I
got in the contour kit I believe I
really like this it's really small I can
do my nose I can get in the hollows of
my cheek so this is the contour brush
I'm going to keep I have two different
foundation type brushes I think I'm
gonna get rid of this royal and
langnickel and just keep this smaller
one I just I prefer the shape of this
and like how small it is and I don't
really use these for foundation I just
use them for skincare so bigger of that
this is another one of those AOA brushes
from shopman say I've been using it for
highlighter really been enjoying it so
I'm going to keep that and now we get
into whatever this stuff is I'm probably
gonna run through this pretty fast again
check out that brush video if you want
to know which ones are my favorites in
what I really like I love this one it's
so tiny and perfect for my lid so I'm
keeping back I like this elf crease
brush I like this brush from Coastal
Scents these are a bunch of various
blending brushes that I really enjoy and
want to keep so I'm going to keep down I
feel like both of these brushes are
pretty similar so I'm going to get rid
of the royal and langnickel just because
it's not as long like I like that this
is a little bit longer and thinner this
way so I'm gonna get rid of that hey one
eye brush down that's pretty good these
are gonna be the hardest ones for me
just because I know I tend to keep them
cuz they get dirty and you know I can
always use it somehow this is one that I
really dislike from the Coastal Scents
brush set this just I can't do eyeliner
with it and I don't use these type of
brushes to do my eyebrows so I'm gonna
get rid of that I love this one though I
use it to like set down my base or
primer on my eyes same with this one I'm
gonna keep that I use it to just put
like cream shadow all over the lid this
is the brush I always used to feel like
pink up in my inner corner and then this
is the same brush I got these off of
ebay but I'm only gonna keep one of them
because honestly they're just like
really crappy quality but I've just
found a way to use this one really well
so I'll keep that these are just some
miscellaneous eyes shader brushes um I
think I'm just gonna get rid of this
Ecotools one just because I don't need
it I should get rid of it but the other
one
I do kind of want a key I have two of
these like angled ones another kind of
like small shader and this one's like a
bit I don't know I like using this to
highlight my brow bone so I'm gonna keep
those these are actually the same brush
from Sigma
this one's just like six years old and
this one's brand new so I'm gonna get
rid of the old one just cuz I don't use
this brush very often and I can't get
rid of it I have some more blending kind
of crease brushes here I'm gonna get rid
of this urban decay one I've used it a
ton but I think it's time to go I don't
really use it anymore I love these two
from colour-pop these are really good
I tend to use this one even though I
think it's the same as that other are
gonna came on quite a bit so I'm gonna
keep that I like this one for this like
just like really lightly blending things
out I love that urban decay one I love
this one and then I think I'm gonna keep
this one even though it's pretty crappy
and get rid of this one another brush I
feel like I can get rid of is this royal
and langnickel one so I'm gonna pass
that on this is from that dough color
set and it's probably nice but I'm not
gonna use it I'm gonna get rid of that I
have two more dough color brushes I
think I'm gonna get rid of this angled
spoolie one it's not that it's not good
I just don't need it and I'm gonna keep
this flat like liner for underneath the
lash line I love this one for the inner
corner and lid and the lip so I'm gonna
keep that like I said I got some of
those AOA brushes and a lot of these are
those they're like nice flat brushes to
add things onto the lid so I'm going to
keep all of these I like them all
I have this lip brush I'm gonna keep I
have some pencil brushes I'm gonna keep
I love a good pencil brush I'm gonna get
rid of this sponge little brush I don't
know why I still have that these are
really the only brushes are used for a
liner I have a color pop one and the
rest of these are from Sigma so I'm
going to keep those this one I use more
of like a project panning brush to like
get to the bottom of things so I'm gonna
keep that this is a fluffy brush I got
off a Coastal Scents
a long time ago I'm gonna get rid of it
it's just like really crappy this one
from ELF
I actually really like I hate that it's
a short handle honestly I wish that it
wasn't it's great to like blending
concealer you can use it for highlight I
just like that you can get kind of a
sheer application so I'm going to keep
that for now I have two of these like
stamper type of brushes
honestly I do use these a lot so I'm
going to keep those this is a Ecotools
brush and it's like I need to glue that
back on but I use it all the time I love
this side for the lower lash line I love
this side for like more precise blending
in the outer corner so I'm going to keep
that and then all of these I feel like I
use and then this is a new brush I think
I'm gonna keep those oh I brush the
hardest they're so hard and then these
are kind of like this is just a random
brush I'm gonna keep that for now and
then these are tools I use this to shave
my face home I use this to like project
pan stuff and then this is like a
glitter applicator I've never used but I
want to so I'm gonna keep it all right
so the goal is met I have all my stuff
in these two brush holders so that makes
me really happy and then I'm getting rid
of all of these brushes so that's pretty
good more than anything I'm just glad
that I was able to get rid of some of
those bigger brushes because a lot of
these like face brushes are just taking
up a lot of real estate in these cups
and now I can put these back into the
coffee mug cabinet where they should be
instead of in my makeup collection stuff
so thank you guys so much for watching I
really appreciate it I hope this
inspires you to go through your own
brushes and get rid of some stuff thanks
so much for watching I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
