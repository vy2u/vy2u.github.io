my blush declutter slash revisit my
collection again like in my other video
I'm not necessarily gonna get rid of
anything I am going to go through and
try to declutter some things if not if
anything just try to get acquainted
again with what I have make sure
nothing's getting lost in the shuffle
here since I have quite a few products
and I will leave part one linked down
below as well as my other declutter
videos but let's get into this we're
going to start off with cream blushes
first which everything in here is that
and then these are all of my like
palette type of stuff so first off here
I have this Stila palette these are
their convertible color blushes cream
blushes and this is in the warm trio
this one has I can't I'm sorry guys like
honeysuckles one camille is one and
Gerber erbia or something like that
that's what's in here I do like this
palette I'm definitely gonna keep it
these are on my favorite formulas for
cream blushes so keeping this one again
from steel I have these other mini ones
this one's in the color lilium and I
really like this one and this one's in
the colour peony I love both of these
and I used to use cream blush all the
time I was like my normal one so I'm
definitely gonna keep these ones as well
I love that there are many sized so not
wasting tons of product so I'm keeping
those I have this josie maran little
Argan infinity lip and cheek creamy oil
I really like this I'm actually keeping
this in my kit right now and I've been
using it as like a cream blush and it
blends into the skin so nice I'm
definitely keeping this this is just a
small size I got in a little kit but I
definitely recommend this one if you're
looking for something it just blends so
nicely so I love this one this is the
Becca Beach tint in the color watermelon
moonstone I have definitely not used
this as much as I should since I you
know paid a lot of money for it it is a
really pretty color I'm definitely
keeping it these also smell so good but
yeah I'm keeping that one I really like
it and I just need to use it especially
during the summer I think it'll be
really beautiful I have this cream blush
by Korres this isn't an absolutely
beautiful color I really have
not use it it just came so hard I felt
like that's it's watched there I'm gonna
keep it it doesn't it doesn't smell off
or anything and I just you know my goal
is to again use a lot of these this year
I have this NYX blush in the color rose
petal I actually think I'm going to part
with this one I just I don't know I like
that is just so creamy and weird I don't
know I don't know if I like this formula
and even if I really love it I have so
many I need to go through so I don't
think I need to keep this one even
though I have used quite a bit of it but
that one's gonna go I'm gonna let go of
it I have four of the Urban Decay glide
on cheeked ins I bought these because
they were being discontinued on the
website so this one here is in in the
color and decent really pretty just
neutral color this isn't a shade quickie
it's like a really bright pink this one
is in the color greedy that one's super
beautiful and just to see how that
swatches out you know I definitely
shares out really nice I love that one
and this one's in the color bang which I
absolutely love like that is a shade I
am about so I will be keeping all of
those I just can't let go of them I
really can't the rest of these are all
tart I have a lot of Tarte cheek
products so this first one here is a
tarte maracuja cheek tint this is in the
color light nectar I bought this off the
sale section on the site because it
wasn't like $12 or $15 I just don't even
know what this is supposed to do it
barely does anything
I'm just not I don't know I'm not into
it I think I might get rid of this I
just feel like the color builds really
strangely and like look how is I was
blending the whole time I don't know how
it's like a big circle on my hand I
don't know if you can see that but um
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna pass this one
along it feels nice the consistency of
it feels nice but I just don't feel like
I can control the product as well as I'd
like to I'm gonna pass this one along
which is surprising to me I wasn't
expecting to do that but after swatching
it and needed to go this one is in my
finish
by Cinco DeMayo so I'm keeping it
because I'm hoping to finish it the rest
of these in here are all of the Tarte
cheek stains I'm pretty sure this is the
full collection I bought that big tube
off a Sephora for way too much money and
I don't know why I invested money in
these when I could have invested in
something else but that is what I did a
regret but I need to own up to it and
use all this crap so I'm not gonna get
rid of any of these I'm really gonna
make it a point to try to use these
products up this first one is in the
shade tipsy oh they're not they're new
that's what it looks like they're these
are not super great swatches if you want
swatches of these I can do a whole video
on them I'm not necessarily like totally
against this formula it's more my
frustration is like I just don't know
why I bought all of these like who needs
all of these honestly this one is in the
color blissful it's like a brighter
pinky red color this one's in the color
exposed yeah I need to use some of these
up my goodness Lauren what did you do to
yourself this one is in the color
fearless this still has the cap on it
that's what that one looks like there
this one here is in the color blushing
bride that one's a really beautiful one
I really like that color this one's in
the color flush this one looks so dark
and scary but really it is quite sheer I
mean that's me running it back and forth
so and I think that's something that's
also like if you're going for a really
no makeup makeup look these look great
but if you're not then you have to like
build these this is in the color natural
beauty that's it there I wonder why this
one isn't like the others and has it
doesn't have like a dome on it hmm that
one's a lot more pigmented than the
other one that one's like a reddish
color whew the last one guys this one's
in the color true love and again that
one looks a really dark but let's
but it comes out - not nearly that's
dark but yeah let me again know in the
comments if you want to see a video just
on these if you want I can definitely do
that for you we are done with cream
blushes let's move on to the palettes
okay so in this tub I have all of my
cheek palettes I have a lot I love a
good cheek palette I think it's a really
fun palette instead of just getting like
big eye ones I love cheek ones so we're
just gonna get into him I cannot see
myself really parting with any of these
but you know you never know if anything
you guys can see what I have but maybe
also it might remind me again to use
some things that I have first off I'm
gonna start off with these Bobbi Brown
palettes these actually just came out
with the spring collection this first
one this first one here is in the color
this is the berry cheek palette
absolutely beautiful there are two like
mats on each side and then there's a
shimmer one in the middle that's how all
of them are constructed I've got all
three colors because I'm a psychopath
but they're absolutely beautiful the
formula of these I think is great I
never had a Bobbi Brown blush before I
got these and I am in love so I love
this one
I think that's be great for darker skin
tones as well this is the Calypso cheek
palette this is the one that convinced
me to buy the others this is a really
pretty peachy pink one this one here is
the pink cheek palette this one is
definitely more cool toned but
absolutely beautiful and I love all
those I will not be getting rid of those
this is the hourglass blush palette this
one has the colors I think it's like
this luminous flush this is mood
exposure and then the middle one is
incandescent the middle one's
incandescent Electra I think this
palette is wonderful I wish that it
didn't have a good exposure on it
because I have that in the full-size but
I do love all of these and I will be
keeping this palette I have two of the
Sephora Pantone universe collections
this one here came out last year with
the radiant orchid collection I
absolutely love this palette this is so
pretty I love this highlight this blush
I think is in the color Spanish rose no
it's in the color Bridal rose is a
Spanish a villa or something anyway I
absolutely love this blush - you can
tell this has gotten a lot of use in
absolute
love it I will not be getting rid of it
and then I was lucky enough to snag this
on this year as well this is for the
color of the year marsala I absolutely
love every blush in there this is
actually the same highlight as in the
other palette which I thought was kind
of lame just because obviously if you're
collector you already have the other one
so I wish they had experimented with a
different shade but I think they all go
very well in the palette together and I
do like it itself definitely not getting
rid of this I love this I use this as an
eyeshadow as well which I will be doing
a tutorial on soon that's the one you
guys all loved but yeah that's that one
I'm not getting rid of it either if you
couldn't guess this isn't Eve polit and
this is the blush trio in sweet cheeks
light I bought this off of HauteLook and
when I got this in the mail I thought I
was pretty disappointed at first but I
actually just really loved all these
blushes just like muted you know color
tone is exactly what I like and I
actually like to somehow swirl all these
together it's kind of hard with the
plastic in the middle but I find a way
to do it I also think you could do a
really pretty contour with this like
soft you know more rosy contour with
this on here I like this trio quite a
bit I don't know if it's worth like the
price I don't know if I'd buy it again
but I do enjoy that I have it I'm not
gonna get rid of it I have a few
different NARS palettes here so let's go
and start off with these this is the
NARS virtual domination palette this
came out this one came out this winter
and I really love this this is that new
Laguna and I definitely have a good dip
going in it but I absolutely love this
palette I'm definitely not getting rid
of it I'm not gonna get rid of any of
the NARS ones for sure this is the NARS
guy board Ann Borden I don't know this
one also has some really beautiful
shades in it
it's not on the back so I'm not gonna
like go over it but I absolutely love
these I'm not getting rid of it and then
this one here this is the NARS the
foreplay palette I kind of wish I didn't
buy this honestly if I'm you know gonna
be a hundred percent honest just because
you know the biggest shade in here I
think is orgasm or super orgasm or
something and I think I have it in the
other ones and you know it just this
palette doesn't always call to me but
I'm definitely not gonna get rid of it I
spent quite a bit of money on it so I'll
be keeping that one and hopefully
getting some good use out of it this one
is probably one of my favorite cheek
palettes I have this
the tarte off-the-cuff palette this came
out with the holiday collection not this
year but not on 2014 but 2013 Christmas
I think the packaging on this is
absolutely perfect it is cute and
sparkly but it is so slim it is just
exactly what you want I think all the
blush shades in here are absolutely
beautiful
all of them are matte except for this
one here but even that one isn't like
super crazy this is a great bronzer they
did just a wonderful job with this
palette I ended up opting out of the one
that came out this last Christmas in
2014 just because the packaging was
absolutely hideous and I feel like these
shades I have these I have my other ones
I didn't need it honestly and then the
packaging was so bulky and nasty so I
hope they come out with something like
this next year and not something gross
like that's crazy for me to not buy a
whole blush palette because the
packaging like that's crazy anyway this
is the lorac cheek palette I bought this
I did like it I go get ready with me
video using these I honestly have not
used these that much at all since I got
them I'm I think it's an absolutely
beautiful palette honestly I just
haven't busted it out and just given it
a fair chance I love just a matte blush
and the only two mats are these top two
and they're quite bright so I definitely
am gonna keep it and try to play around
a thing and get some nice love out of it
this is a very pretty color but it is
again really pigmented you have to be
careful this cheek palette is by Benefit
this I bought off of all cosmetics
wholesale I didn't buy this when it like
actually came out or anything it was
kind of disappointing when I bought this
this came busted I've thrown away the
pieces since I got it but this one is
Corley so that is dandelion and this one
is Dallas I have a mini coralista up
besides this one I this is the only
dandelion I have and this is the only
Dallas I have yeah I haven't used this I
don't even think once because it came
broken and then I just felt like it was
tainted but I definitely want to keep
these these are great blushes and
makes me not have to buy the full-size
if I have these ones so I'm gonna make
me anyway I'm gonna keep this one and
hopefully use it more than I have since
it really hasn't been used this is the
Terina tarantino this is the dahle skin
cheek palette I bought this when they
still sold terena tarantino at sephora
so this has for blush shades in it this
is a very pretty palette I've seen a
couple people have this on youtube but I
know that it's like old school so it's
funny um it doesn't tell me what the
colors are in here but these but these
ones do not match the two that I have in
like a full-size blush but yeah I really
love this one even though I this one is
older I'm definitely not getting rid of
it I I still really like them and I'm
gonna keep it so yeah keeping it and
then this last palette that I have here
was one I actually made myself so I'll
go through the things that I can I guess
in the air I'm not gonna get rid of
anything in this palette this is
benefits whoo I had this in like the
Cabana set and i depotted that this is
Benefit score least I believe this was
also in there somehow I had it and i
depotted it this is lancome's like peach
like transitioning blush it's really
pretty it reminds me a lot of like those
Mac Toledo ones this is actually Estee
Lauder's peach nuance so if you want
that I got that off the wall cosmetics
wholesale and they have like a bronzer
one and a pink one instead of a peach
one on there definitely check it out if
you like it
this is Too Faced papadum peach I love
this blush that one's so pretty this is
also Too Faced snow bunny this one right
here my camera is gonna die this one
right here is Clinique's blush in tuxedo
plum these are just some random ones
from pixie that i depotted from a huge
palette this is a Tarte one that came in
that one it's kind of like a bronzy
color these are actually playboy ones I
got off of all cosmetics wholesale the
quality on them is actually quite good
and then last but not least this is a
clinic one little blush and it's like a
I mean a highlighter really that's what
I use it as but yeah those are all of my
items it was a lot honestly these are
the only two things
I'm getting rid of two cream products
but again better than nothing I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video be sure
to check out my other ones and I will
see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
