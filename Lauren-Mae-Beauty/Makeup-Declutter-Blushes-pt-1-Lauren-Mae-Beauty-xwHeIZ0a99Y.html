the best part of my collection
besides eyeshadow palettes but I'm gonna
do my blush declutter video today so
this is going to be potentially a
declutter but it could just potentially
also be just a collection video I'm not
forcing myself to get rid of any of
these but I definitely want to look
through remind myself of what I have and
kind of see if there's any room for
getting rid of stuff I kind of feel like
there's not but I don't know maybe I can
find one and that'd be a success this is
going to be a two-part video so these
are gonna be all of my regular powder
blushes and then I'm gonna do a second
video with all my cream blushes and also
face palettes so yeah I think that's
everything let's get into it because
this is going to take a really long time
okay I'm gonna start with this smaller
one here this is benefits rocket or I'm
gonna be keeping this blush it's super
pretty and honestly if you can see that
you can see the imprint I haven't used
it too much at all so definitely want to
use this some more keeping with benefit
blushes I have sugar bomb here as well
this one I have gotten some decent use
out of and I really like this on it's a
very warm tone blush I have quite a few
of the balm blushes so this is a frat
boy here this is probably my favorite
it's a really pretty pinky peach color
that one I've used the most
then there's cabana boy which is like a
dark mauve plummy color then there's
down boy which is a really pretty mafi
pink color and then last but not least
there is hot mama which is a really
pretty peachy gold color it's kind of
like a rose gold peach gold color I
really like that one as well these are
the two Tarina Tarantino blushes that I
just bought this one here is in the
color charm I really like that one this
one once you guys have heard so much
about is Neapolitan lane which is my
absolute favorite right now love that
blush not getting rid of any of those I
have to hourglass blushes here this
first one is
in ethereal glow I do not like this
blush it does not show up like if you
see there on my skin it just looks like
a white pink powder I'm not gonna get
rid of it because it's so expensive I
wish I returned it when I have the
chance but I didn't so I will try to
find a way to make this work or
something I don't know I'm gonna keep it
or I don't know if I ever did a swap or
something I don't know something I'm
gonna keep it for now just because it's
so expensive but I definitely regret
buying this one yeah I definitely regret
it
this on the other hand is made exposure
and I love this one this is such a
pretty pretty blush I really like this
is like definitely my type of color so
keeping both of those I have to at the
Clinique cheek pop blushes this one here
is in ginger pop which is quite
beautiful and the other one I have is in
peach pop I am so excited because they
just came out with more of these blushes
on sephora's website
amber F talked about Cola which I have
to get I like absolutely love it I also
want like the melon one and fig and
Heather like I'm probably gonna go a
little crazy so if I get some of those
during the baby sale I might do like a
swatch video but definitely not getting
rid of those and I will be adding more
to my collection as soon as I possibly
can I have two of the two face
sweetheart blushes this one is the one I
got first in the perfect flush blush and
this is in candy glow this one has seen
quite a bit of wear I definitely have a
dip going in it it's a very pretty color
has some sparkle to it it's just a
really nice flush of color on the cheeks
I love that one and then this one I
bought because I love the other one so
much this one is in the color peach
Beach and I really haven't used it
nearly as much as that other one it's
very beautiful I'm gonna keep it still I
mean I'm not gonna get rid of it I just
need to use it more if anything just
remind myself to use that I don't know
how to say the name of this blush so I'm
gonna zoom in on the back of the tag
that is this blush here I got this blush
in France with Sam and it is a very
pretty just you know classic pink blush
color it was kind of one of my souvenirs
they have Sephora on the shots at lycée
and that's why I bought this and yeah I
love it I'll never get rid of this blush
ever ever well it was really cool about
this blush is you bought the packaging
and then you bought the blush actually
separate and you put it in so yeah I
really liked that one I really loved it
still and it's great memory so I'm not
getting rid of it I have these - steela
what are these even called countless
color pigments and I have this one here
this is in the color indie and this one
is in the color lyric I think both of
these are really beautiful
I honestly you know haven't used them
that much this is quite a vivid blush I
don't know if it's gonna pick up on
camera how purple that is but I think
it's still so pretty and then lyric is a
very pretty normal normal colored blush
I just like both of them I can't bring
myself to get rid of them yet so I'll be
keeping both of those as well
this is Illamasqua lover this was one of
my favorite blushes top 5 I love this
blush it's so beautiful I suggest it to
everyone it's so pretty I'm definitely
not getting rid of that another one of
my favorite blushes this is girl lactic
Milan I mean look at that color it's
beautiful definitely you get this one as
well and I'm not getting rid of it this
is a Marc blush in the color it's a
wonder glow blush and glow that's all it
really says on the back here I think I'm
gonna actually get rid of this one I
mean I think it's so beautiful
I actually hauled this in an all
cosmetics wholesale haul which I'll link
down below but I just haven't I mean I
haven't used it yet and you see all the
blushes that I have here that's it's
watched if you can even see it I just
don't think that I'm gonna reach for
this one especially not over the ones I
already have I really got this just
because I thought the design was so
pretty and I thought I'd at least check
it out so I'm gonna pass this along to
someone in my class because I do not
think that I will get the wear out of it
it's a really pretty peachy color but I
have a million pretty peachy colors and
I'd rather use those ones than this one
so this will be going along yay one yes
I have a couple Rimmel blushes here then
is a really popular one this is Santa
Rosa and I love this blush it doesn't
look like anything in the pan but it is
a really really nice blush I'll be
keeping this one I really like the
formula of these right when I got into
these they like discontinued them so I
was like trying to go to all these
drugstores to find them this one is in
the color tickled me pink this one's
also just a great classic pink color I'm
gonna keep that one but they
discontinued them so I couldn't find
them anywhere so that's just frustrating
so these are I believe discontinued you
might be able to find them on some
random website but you can't just go to
Walgreens or wherever to get them and
then this last like mini one here this
isn't the color plum I have tried to get
rid of this one before because I really
haven't used it but I can't bring myself
to do it that's it there and now that
the color of yours marsala I feel like
this looks really similar to that color
so I'm gonna keep this one as well
why not hoard them all right let's hoard
together this is a number 7 blush in the
color soft damson and this is also a
really pretty color it's a nice like
dusty pink but it does have a little bit
more like brightness to it I really like
this color as well I was using this one
for a while I'm gonna be keeping it I
told you I'm not gonna get rid of that
much oh this is the Michael Todd blush
and Lilia it's in my project pan I'm not
getting rid of that that I want to use
that by the end of the year so no on
that one I mean no I'm not getting rid
of it I'm keeping it I have a couple
laura geller blushes here this first one
is probably my favorite in the color
bora-bora
it's a very beautiful peachy pink color
I love wearing this in the summer I've
gotten some good wear out of this one
and I'm definitely keeping it this one
is in the color Sun slept this is a
really pretty like tan gold color it is
definitely pigmented and very bronze as
well so this definitely is like a
special occasion type of thing or you
know a purpose blush but I really like
it I'm not going to
rid of it I like it and then the last
one I have here the last one is
boysenberry and what I love about this
one is its matte and I don't feel like
she has a ton of matte blushes so
swatched there that's it I just think
that's a beautiful color I like all
these I think Laura Keller does not get
enough credit here on YouTube or enough
like talk but I think these blushes are
great especially if you can buy her
stuff in packs you can get such a great
deal on them because these alone are
expensive but when you buy like a set
you can get a ton of stuff for like $50
instead of only one product for like 30
so really like that I'm keeping all of
those this is an Australis blush in the
color hotties and secrets I'm keeping
this I also hold this in that all
cosmetic sale haul and the color on this
is just beautiful and I like it so I'm
keeping it we've already kind of been
digging into this one here but we're
just gonna keep going with it we're
almost we're almost there guys half way
that's pretty awesome I have three
Milani blushes here these were I got
these when they were limited edition and
now they have come out and made some of
them permanent but the colors that I
have this one here is warm petal petals
I have not used that one yet it's a
really pretty peachy golden e color I
don't think I want to get rid of it I
just don't want to get rid of it this
one here is Bella Rosa and it is just a
classic it is matte pink color really
pretty again have a not really used this
one and then this one though romantic
rose now this is my favorite you can
tell here that I've used quite a bit of
it because the Rose is coming off I
absolutely love this one this one is not
limited edition anymore I would
definitely pick it up again in my top 5
favorites this is amazing cosmetics
mucho mango again in my top 5 I
absolutely love this blush I will not be
getting rid of it
this is a blush from Maybelline it was
limited edition and it's called coral
burst it is a very vibrant orange color
it's absolutely stunning I really like
this one and what I love is it is
pigmented but it also isn't insanely
hard to like sheer out on the cheek so I
will be keeping this one as well this is
the NYX blush in cinnamon
is like an orange color as well I feel
like I'm gonna get rid of this one just
because I have that other one which
although this is matte and this one is
shimmer I just have not worn this and I
don't see the need for having that many
like super orange blushes especially
since I love the mucho mango so I'm
gonna get rid of this one and pass this
one along this is a blush by Estee
Lauder actually got this at a CCO we
don't have C cos or I didn't know we had
CC I was in Arizona this one is a very
bright color I don't know why I decided
to get this one this is in the color
naughty and it is an orange color Wow
all these ones have been orange but it
is more of red orange and it also is
like a matte satin finish I will be
keeping this one just because I haven't
even had the chance or I haven't made
the chance to play with this and I do
really like it I bought it for a reason
so I will be keeping this one in my
collection I didn't mention this one
with the other Milani blushes but this
is absolutely one of my favorites and
this is the oh so popular Luminoso I
think this is really great I'm gonna get
a couple more of these ones I've been
seeing some that I feel like just are
great I don't want the whole collection
but I do want I think two other colors I
can't remember their names that looked
really interesting to me so keeping of
course that one and then everything left
in here is all Tarte stuff so I will
pull that out this is a Tarte blush this
came in a pack I got but you can get
this off of Sephora I saw it recently
this is in the color pink bronze that's
what the packaging or that's what the
powder looks like it is definitely just
like a bronzy color it probably should
go with my bronzers honestly I'm gonna
keep this because I think it's pretty
but I really haven't wanted them I
definitely need to bust it out more so
keeping that I have three full-sized
Tarte blushes the first one here is the
tartlet one this came out with their
like 15 anniversary or some type of
special deal this is an absolutely
beautiful blush if you have fair skin I
think this would look absolutely
beautiful on you even up to medium it is
quite a light blush but it is absolutely
gorgeous I love this one obviously my
top 5 can only be 5 but this one is very
very beautiful and you can tell that I
have
learn away a little bit of that imprint
so definitely have gotten some great use
out of this and I am keeping it in that
packaging uh-huh so cute this one by
Tarte is in the color flush now this one
is kind of crazy I got this um at Ulta
for Black Friday like two years ago
there was like a pack for $24 for this
and I think a full-size lip surgence and
that's a super great deal considering
this blush alone I think is even worth
more than that so I got this I have not
really used this color but I'm not
getting rid of it so kill me but I'm
keeping it I'm keeping it and then the
last full-size one I have here is in
exposed this was also in my top 5 I love
this colored blush this is just you know
you can kind of see a trend here this is
one of my favorite colors and I love it
I'm not getting rid of it I have a ton
of these Tarte blushes that have this
like limited-edition there
limited-edition but they have like this
design on the packaging four of these
came in a set for Christmas and then one
of them came in like a mini set with
just like this and another product so
this is the color Mirage I'm not getting
rid of any of these so but this is the
color Mirage this one is the color
daydream this one is in the color of
more this one's in the color classic I
really like that color and this one is
in the color prim which I also really
like this color as well so I have those
ones and then these two came in a set
like that but like two or three
Christmases ago and I absolutely love
both of these as well these are in my I
want to use these up I think by the end
of the year I think they might be in
there or maybe that's just like a
private goal that isn't in a project pan
but that's something I want to get some
good use out of these because I have had
in a while this first one here is in the
color magic and this one is in the color
fantastic and I have used that one quite
a bit because it doesn't have as much of
an imprint but both those are really
beautiful in their match and that is
everything we did it we did it okay guys
so we are done these obviously are not
keeping but I am getting rid of two
blushes which for a hoarder like me
that's pretty good so two blushes out
the rest I am keeping and hopefully
going to love and then I don't have Part
two up which again will be cream and
palettes I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know if you guys have any
declutter videos or kind of like
rediscovering your collection video

oh yeah I remember what I have and want
to pull stuff out and yeah let me know
