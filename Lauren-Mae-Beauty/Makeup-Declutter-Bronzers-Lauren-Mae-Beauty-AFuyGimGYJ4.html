decluttering video these are all the
bronzers I have I don't feel like I have
a massive problem with bronzers I mean
that may seem crazy because this is a
lot of bronzers but yeah this is what I
actually store them in in my like big
IKEA drawers which eventually I might do
a collection type of video and this
sounds like showing you where I store it
but I'm just not there yet so anyway
I'll show you guys what I have so my
goal today is to get rid of some of
these bronzers I feel like I'm in a good
position to do this today I'm in the
mood to get rid of more than I have been
lately so let's do this thing
the first bronzer I have here is Bahama
Mama this one is really dark I'm gonna
be keeping this one only because I think
it's great to have the option of a dark
bronze are like this I don't really have
anything else like this so I'm going to
be keeping that this is a Too Faced
bronzer in the color creme brulee and I
think that I am going to be putting this
in a maybe pile obviously this is a very
shimmery bronzer and I really only need
one shimmery bronzer so I'm gonna put on
my show my bronzers to the side and only
keep one of them so put this to the side
this is another Too Faced product this
is the chocolate Soleil bronzer I am
currently panning this for finished by
by Cinco de Mayo so I'm gonna be keeping
that one this is an Elizabeth Arden
bronzer and this is in the color medium
this is also very shimmery so I'm going
to put this with the Too Faced one
that's it there and you know only keep
one of those so this is a maybe we'll
come back to it type of thing this is a
laura geller
bronzed big body frosting in the color
Tahitian glow that is so pretty I really
like this I think this is also shimmery
yeah I'm pretty sure that one's Cherie -
so um yeah I'm gonna put this over there
with those two but I really like this
one probably the most
I have this lorac tantalizer this has
like a bronzer and a highlighter on it
um I think I'm gonna pass this along
only because I don't really need it I
bought this and I don't need it so I'm
gonna pass this one yeah one down this
is a Physicians Formula healthy bronzer
healthy wear bronzer in the color fair
eye this is a very strange product I was
using it for a while I'm gonna keep this
just because I want to use it up I think
that's something I can use up and that's
why I'm keeping it because I want to
actually use it so I'll keep that one
for now this is another toothpaste
product this is the Too Faced pink
leopard brightening bronzer um yeah I
don't need this I'm gonna just pass this
one along it's really old and I don't I
don't think I've ever used it you can
still see everything in there it's just
been swatched a million times so passing
the oil on this is the bourgeois
bronzing primer this is supposed to be
like a dupe for the Chanel one I got
this in France okey I'm gonna keep this
it's the only like cream bronzer I have
so I want to keep it and kind of just
experiment with it and see if I like it
I've only used it one time so this one
is the Too Faced Sunbeam little deluxe
eyes mini I think I'm gonna pass this
one along as well only because I am
pretty fair and I just don't need this
you know I don't know I don't need this
so I'm gonna pass it on I've never used
it passing it this is a Dior bronzer
this is in the shade honey tan Oh - I
have used this one a little bit this has
shimmer in it but I'm not counting it as
part of like the shimmer like those ones
at plus I think it's kind of an
overspray I'm gonna be keeping this one
that same sister gave me this because
she got the wrong color this is that
huge Sephora soul dubrio bronzing powder
I love this one I think this is a great
bronzer and I'm gonna be keeping this
it's huge
I'll never run out but I really
like this I'm gonna keep that one this
is my Anasazi a Beverly Hills contour
kit this is just like the regular one
it's not like I made the shades in here
or something I've gotten some use out of
this I honestly personally don't think
this palette is just for me I don't like
love it but I will be keeping it to try
to use these products up yeah that's
where I'm at with that this is a NARS
body glow bronze glow I don't even know
I've never used this I got this in like
a kit from Sephora and I'm going to be
passing this along because I have never
used it I probably will never use it so
no going away this is the bourgeois
powder bronzer like the chocolate bar
one I just don't I don't know how I feel
about this I know a lot of people like
it I mean it is pretty I think I'm gonna
pass it though since I have the inkling
I'm gonna pass this on along so it's
gonna go away I also just you know I
know I'm gonna keep it I I think I'm
actually gonna keep this one because it
is matte and I'm gonna start running out
of matte things soon so I'm gonna keep
this one and put it over there this is
the Jomon Shea bronzer in I can't even
say it but I got this um I just loved
the way it looked and I couldn't not get
it I've since obviously used it this is
more of like a glowy bronzer but it
doesn't have like sparkle in it it just
is a really nice sheen so I'm gonna keep
this one this isn't part of like those
ones to me and then I forgot I have a
couple more bronzers because that's
gonna film a different video so I'm
gonna go grab those really fast okay so
I have five more bronzers that weren't
like in here so I'm gonna put them over
here this changes everything
this changes the game I have gone back
to getting rid of this so I'm gonna get
rid of it because I have I forgot I had
these ones
in here because they were in a different
place and I was like wait a minute but
I'm gonna get rid of the bourgeois one
this is another many of the chocolate
Soleil bronzer that I'm like using up
it's just a separate one I'm gonna keep
it because I do like it this is a mini
gnar's bronzer I'm going to also keep
that and then this is the Milani baked
bronzer this one is in the color oh
eight sunset I really like this product
and it is supposed to be matte has a
little bit of a sheen but it's
definitely for you know most purposes
matte so I'm gonna keep that this is NYC
smooth skin bronzer and sunny I'm gonna
be keeping this as well this is just a
great option I really like that
and then this is the cosmetics CC
radiant ombre bronzer and I have used
this quite a bit you can see a little
bit of pan showing through there I'm
gonna be keeping this I really like this
product as well
okay so let's decide I have to make a
decision and I'm pretty sure I already
made this decision I'm keeping the laura
geller one and i will be getting rid of
these two okay guys you should be so
proud this is like the most I've gotten
rid of in the category and the least
amount of products in a category and the
most I've gotten rid of the ratio is
insane okay so let me put all the ones
I'm keeping in here so I'm keeping all
the ones and I'm gonna be getting rid of
all of these products so I have an
Elizabeth Arden yeah so good so lots of
lots of products it is seven products
that's crazy to me
I can't believe it um yeah let's get
let's go into highlighters I'm gonna go
in highlighters now bye guys we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
