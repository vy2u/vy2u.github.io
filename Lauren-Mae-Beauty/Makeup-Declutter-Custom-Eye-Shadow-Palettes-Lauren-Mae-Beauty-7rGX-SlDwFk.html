of declutter video but this is gonna be
that's seriously my neighbors upstairs
it's like past ten o'clock help me okay
anyway I'm sorry this is going to be my
decluttering of all of my like self-made
eyeshadow palettes so I wanted to go
through I feel like I did pot a lot of
things and then I have all these random
shadows and I want to go through and
just like get rid of some and also just
organize them better so that I can find
what I'm looking for easier if that
makes sense
so I'm going to go in and do that here
so I'm gonna like separate it this is
just an this is just an empty Z palette
that I have and I'm gonna make this like
all of my like everyday shadows that
maybe are a little weird that I could
easily just grab from this palette and I
don't know we'll we'll see how it goes I
guess I don't really have a plan for
this whole video it's kind of a weird
one so this one here this is like a
palette that I've made myself I'm gonna
keep everything in here because I just
like the way I've set this up I have a
lot of my like mattes and neutrals on
this side and then just some really fun
either shimmery or bright colors on this
side I think they go really well
together I can definitely get a ton of
different looks out of here and I just
overall like the way this palette is
constructed so I'm gonna be keeping this
palette like that and obviously all the
shadows inside of it this palette here
are all of my still Ozzie steel Ozzie I
think that's I said eyeshadows all of
these ones here except for this mint one
and these smaller ones are from there so
I think that I'm going to remove all
those other ones and kind of put them to
the side so I can add them to different
palettes so I've cleaned that palette
out I'm gonna keep this um like I guess
pure for right now just that same brand
all the same shape and all that for
right now and then I might add other
stuff to it later once I have this a
little more organized so let's put this
aside now all of these palettes except
for this one here these are actually
Coastal Scents palettes and they used to
have like separate individual
but I went through and took that out I
was just like foam and I made them just
these huge pallets and then I did have
them sorted by color at like warm
neutrals cool neutrals which is back
here greens and blooms and then pinks
and reds and purples so I think I'm
gonna go through and just organize this
and make that happen so that they look
nice and collected real fast so I
probably just like speed this footage
you
okay so that is my new green eyeshadow
it's green and blues in there are some
golds down here I'm going to keep this
this way and I'm not gonna get rid of
any of these these are basically all
Coastal Scents ones and I just wanted
them it's just to look more put together
so that's gonna be done this is the cool
tone one so I'm gonna do the same thing
these aren't like super organized like
going from lightest to darkest but at
least it's a little bit more organized
than it really really was
you
okay so this is my cool neutrals palette
I'm going to keep it that way as well
it's kind of the best we can get now
these are all my pinks and purples and
stuff I'm going to add these other
shades here to this just so it looks
nice and organized
I'm also going to take shades out that
do not match this color scheme
so I took out some sheets that didn't
belong and then I added those other
sheets so this palette is good and then
this is gonna be like my warm neutrals
this is also one that I kind of
gravitate to so it has kind of a little
bit of everything but mostly just like
lots of really warm shades maybe like
warm red Browns that I feel like I could
work into neutral that's instead of
putting it in the other palettes I'm
gonna add these ones I have here on the
side that somehow or in that other one
okay so that's my warm neutrals palette
and I really like that it looks really
really good so I'm gonna keep that like
that yeah I haven't gotten rid of
anything so I don't know how it's really
going this is just like a random
assortment of shadows so I'm gonna open
this up and kind of see what's going on
these are all steel ones not steel Ozzie
just like regular steel uh shadows in
the pan form and then these ones here
are all Medusa's makeup these are all
from the exotic line or I don't know
they all have two types of shadows like
ones like the neon and this is like the
Safari I think it's safari line there's
12 of those and then I have these ones
here these are mary kay so I'm gonna go
through I don't think I'm gonna get rid
of any of these because it's like a
whole collection and I like all of them
but I'm gonna kind of go through my
steel ones and just maybe get rid of
some and try to combine them into maybe
this pallet with the steel ozzie and
just have them all in one so I can kind
of like just get rid of some stuff
because I don't need I don't need all of
those I like a lot of them but I really
don't need them all this is the color
prize I'm gonna keep that one in here I
don't know if these are all gonna fit
this is the color Koko is just like I'm
Matt Brown I want to keep that as well I
guess maybe I'll just go through the
ones I want to get rid of from invalid
um I think the ones I want to get rid of
yeah this color here this is in the
color vine it's like a grey green color
I'm gonna get rid of that one I don't
need it um this isn't my color black cat
I'm also gonna get rid of that I don't
need a black color so yeah this wisteria
color is just not that great of a purple
I'm gonna get rid of that
um I don't know this is really hard um
I'm gonna get rid of this color as well
this isn't 14-karat it's just not
pigmented enough for me
I'm really trying here guys
to get rid of crap I don't need but it's
not easy um I think this color is really
pretty this is the color twig but I'm
gonna get rid of that one too it's just
not quite as pigmented as I'd like I
just don't need it really this one here
is called Sparkle yeah I like that one
it's pretty I'm gonna keep Sparkle I'm
also gonna keep this mint color called
cha cha I think that one's really pretty
and I kind of think I'm gonna keep the
rest these are all just like matte
Browns and I think they're really just
useful colors to have they're all in a
difference oh I can't see that I'm sorry
I'm gonna be keeping the rest of these
for they're all match I think they're
just great colors to have they all have
a different tone and they could all be
used to help define a look in the crease
and stuff so I'm going to keep those as
well
I'm not sure if they're gonna fit in
here though the reason I'm really doing
this to you is I just want to condense
down so I have empty palettes if I
wanted to do pot something else or you
know just be more organized with what I
have so so I ended up putting all my
produces makeup ones in here as well I
didn't get rid of any of those and now
the only thing left in this palette are
these Mary Kay eyeshadows in this random
one I am gonna keep I think all these
Mary Kay wands you think they're all
really pretty I really haven't had the
chance to use them and I think they all
work well together so I'm gonna move
those and try to make them fit in here
if they can't fit in this space then I'm
going to get rid of one of them and I
will make them fit and then this little
lone sucker this is a
an urban decay eyeshadow in the color
mushroom I have a shadow of mushroom and
I just I don't need it so I'm going to
get rid of that one as well
so just a recap this one has all my
Stila shadows in it this has Medusa's
makeup and as well and then these ones
here are on my mirror and Kay shadows
and I think this palettes mostly done so
we'll set that to the side this palette
is completely empty now so this is a
little Z palette that I have this has
all of my depotted Urban Decay shadows
in it I think at this point I'm just
gonna keep what's in here I just don't
think that I'm gonna be able to really
condense this down in a way that's gonna
fit in other categories so I'm just
gonna keep this for now and kind of work
through these a little bit later and see
what shadows I really like some of these
are kind of glittery but I'm gonna hold
on to all of these they fit nice in this
palette and I can't see them fitting
anywhere else at this point so just
gonna hold onto those in this palette I
have just a bunch of single eyeshadows
some of them are starters makeup Haven
some of them are Coastal Scents this one
here is actually Mac this is mythology
yeah so I'm gonna put these into these
bigger palettes by color just to add
them in there so yeah I'm gonna do that
right now so I can have this empty and
just totally done with
even though this one's kind of purple
yeah I'm gonna put it in the warm
neutrals because I think it'll be really
pretty for a look
you
so this is now empty I've added those to
my like four stacks so that's good and
it's empty that's awesome these shadows
here actually all to face tones I just
showed these in my weekly make a basket
but I am going to be keeping all of
these and I like the way they're also
placed so I'm going to be keeping them
in this palette everything the same so
that's done and then the last little
palette I have here this one is also
just a mini one just full of random
eyeshadows these two pieces like these
duo's are NARS ones
these three are Stila and this is like a
random one I got from an Ipsy bag but I
like the color so I'm gonna keep it so
I'm gonna get rid of these three shadows
all the Stila ones I just don't need
them honestly I left that one just broke
it just broke right now they just aren't
needed in my collection it looks like I
just hate Stila but I don't and I'm
gonna be adding all of these shadows to
my steel eysie palette to my steel Ozzie
palette so I'll show you what that looks
like in one second so now this palette
is actually empty and this is what the
steel Ozzie one looks like so I am my
still Ozzy's my NARS and then this
random like I think it's UB or something
like that yeah be I'm sorry
and a yappy one so I'm gonna keep that
like that okay so I think that's
everything I'm gonna do I'm gonna go
through and show you what all the
palettes look like so that's this one
finished now I'm kind of more organized
I have that little two-faced one also my
little Urban Decay one those are all
done I have my four mostly Coastal
Scents eyeshadows but anything really in
this shape and it's sorted by color so
this is like blues blues and greens I
have cool neutrals Pink's oranges reds
purples those types of colors and then I
have like a warm neutrals palette so I
have all those this one here is all are
all my Stila ones and also Medusa's
makeup and Mary Kay this is kind of like
my pre-made palette ready to go at any
time
with neutrals as well as shimmers
bright colors so I could do kind of any
look I needed to this has everything in
it and that's everything I have the two
empty pallets now so I've just kind of
condensed my collection and then I've
gotten look at all the shadow it's
everywhere oh I can't handle it okay all
these shadows Here I am getting rid of
these are all the big steel pot single
eyeshadows these are also some steel ons
that i depotted out of different
palettes and then this one here is
actually Urban Decay mushroom so those
I'm gonna get rid of I don't know what
to do with them I think I might put them
in one of these palettes just for now
but I honestly I don't know like I can't
like save them I don't know if I should
throw them away let me know in the
comments down below if you have like a
solution of like how I could transport
these to someone or not like ruin them
but also not use up a pallet because I
obviously don't want them but I'm just
going to do that for now but let me know
in the comments down below this video
this like part of the decluttering was
kind of weird so I hope it wasn't too
too weird but this is also part of my
collection and I did need to go through
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
my next one is gonna be my large eye
shadow palette so that should be
exciting that's like one of my favorite
things ever so I'm excited to go through
