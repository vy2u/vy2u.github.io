off my nail polish so they're actually
stained I don't know if that's better
anyway this is gonna be the decluttering
of my pigments and glitters I have quite
a bit I mean I think that's a lot for
this type of makeup item and I just want
to go through and make sure these are
things I want again this doesn't mean I
have to get rid of anything but if I
want to this is the time to do it or put
it kind of on watch so let's just get
straight into it
I actually zoomed in and change up the
angle so anyway these ones here these
are Jessie's girls I have three of them
here this one is in the color Sunset
Boulevard I'm keeping this on this was
in a favourites February favourites
video this one is in the color pixie
dust it's like a gold and white
duochrome
I don't want to swatch too much of this
crap because it will get or wear but um
that's it there I'm gonna keep this just
to see if I have anything else like it
and then compare the ones that are
similar look it's already happening I'm
gonna keep it for now this one is in the
color Penny Arcade that one is quite
pretty I am gonna swatch it though just
to see oh that's so pretty oh my oh yes
I'm keeping it it's not super pigmented
but it would look great over a copper
shade and then like use like glitter
glue or whatever so I'm definitely
keeping this one I'm gonna put this one
in the maybe that's the maybe pile I
have these two Laura Mercier pigments I
have one in the color amethyst or
crushed amethyst and one in the color
crushed lapis these are both very
beautiful I'm keeping both of them I
already know that so I really like you I
really Sportage when I got these but I
do not regret it so keeping those two
all of these pigments here are bare
minerals or bare essentials or whatever
the heck their brand is so I'm just
gonna go through and see which ones I
like this is in the color dove this is
like a matte grey color
well it's like a satiny color that's it
there I'm gonna keep it I don't have
anything quite like this one I think
it'd be really pretty for a wedding
look um so I'm gonna keep it one not
gotten rid of sadly this isn't the color
good fortune I got this in that same
like glitzy Sephora bag and I have never
used it it's quite psycho and shimmery
um yeah I'm gonna get rid of this one I
do not need this in my life I've never
used it and I have no desire to so
getting rid of that one oh that's in its
own pile this one is in the color white
gold this one looks like that other
Jesse's girl one oh but it's so much
better look at them next to each other
so I will be getting rid of that Jesse's
girl one and keeping this white gold and
I will still be on the lookout just in
case there is not a match so Jesse's
girls going bye-bye this one here is in
the color silk rose I really like this
color this is the type of color I think
would look so good just all over the lid
yeah I'm gonna keep that one that one's
really pretty and I feel like quite
unique whoa quite unique as well oh it's
so pretty
yes this is princess by bareMinerals
yeah I do like that one I like a good
purple man I'm gonna keep that one as
well because I can't say no this one is
in the color golden blue I know for sure
I'm keeping this one but I thought I
would swatch it for you guys cuz it is
just the coolest color so that is what
it looks like that's what it looks like
in the pan but then I get some of it on
my finger and swatch it for you what
it's like turning blue it turns blue
what the heck it's crazy I love this
color I'm definitely keeping it it's
like once you like crush it into your
skin I don't even
oh man I don't even know it's crazy
voodoo magic and I love it this one's in
the color stay golden no I didn't get
like any pigment I barely got any
pigment and it did that I'm gonna keep
this one this feels really similar to
the texture of this one they're
definitely like heavier pigments and I
think that performs very nicely it
probably would look really nicely
pressed as well so um keeping it okay
we're not doing as good as I thought
with the bare minerals ones I thought at
least I did really like I want to
purchase them right this one's in the
shade oh natural and I believe this is
like a pinky duo cartlett City yeah I
gotta keep it I love this type of color
on the inner corner it's like it's not
showing up quite right it's like flashes
like a bright pink mm yeah keeping and
the last bare minerals color here this
is in the color mint very simple name
and yeah I don't know I mean it's pretty
but I think I'm gonna pass this on a
long too just because I have so many
mint colors and different forms that
even though this would look good for
that man I'm gonna put it in the maybe I
don't know it does look pretty doesn't
it it's gonna go into maybe the last
pigments I have here are these NYX ones
I got these when I first started to
makeup I got like a kid of I'm for like
$15 which is way overpriced but I didn't
know that at the time so I have since
gotten rid of them but let's see what
else we can do this isn't the color
walnut pearl I really like that color
oh my nails still a Korbel um I'm gonna
keep it said uh I just like all of these
though real bad I'm gonna keep all of
these and I might put these in my well
okay let's go through them
there's the one that pearl I'm gonna
keep that one this isn't the color the
mink pearl that is just such a beautiful
color this is in the color or oh pearl
that one's also beautiful it's more like
bronzy this one is in the color yellow
gold I definitely wanna keep this one I
have used it before for a look I'm gonna
keep it
this one's in the color nude pearl I
might get rid of this one just because I
feel like it's such a generic shade I
don't need it so that one's gonna go and
then this one is in the color mocha
pearl and I think that's nice if you're
gonna do like a more cool to look so I
will keep that one so at least I'm down
to five only of those so that's that's
good I think that's okay
all right guys all that's left are these
glitters in here so let's get into them
this one here is a zodiac glitter by
Lime Crime this is in the color or
fiocchis dude I don't even know it's
really pretty just holographic glitter I
love it I'm keeping it yeah
keeping it I have three glitters from
Medusa's makeup this one's in the color
Pegasus I love this color this is like
my up my alley I actually used this to
do Pluto brows once so I'm gonna keep
that color this one's in the color ak-47
it is just like a rainbow glitter I'm
also gonna keep that one I think it's
really fun yeah I'm gonna keep that this
one's in the color Material Girl is like
a gold and pink colored one I'm also
gonna keep this one it's so pretty
glitters just I love them I love
glitters okay now all the glitters in
here I'm gonna keep them all what I got
these off of all cosmetics wholesale and
these are just so amazing let me show
you really why why these are amazing
they all come in a case like this and
what's so amazing is if you go like this
and you open them you think oh it's just
a vial glitter no girl it has a doe foot
applicator honey it makes it so easy for
precise application I really like that
about them I mean if you think about it
there's not as much product in here but
how much glitter can you use so again I
got this set on with all cosmetics
wholesale if you're looking for these
definitely check them out they are by
the brand of pop beauty and I'm pretty
sure they're still on there and I think
they're only like 399 or something crazy
anyway
that's everything so let me give you
guys an overview these are the items I'm
gonna be keeping umm it looks pretty
similar to how it did look but you know
whatever
I am only thing
about one item this one and mint so
we'll see and then three colors I am
actually giving away so I'm gonna put
those in make a boy pile that isn't a
ton of stuff but I think for you know
these items I really could grow when you
look at my makeup inventory I wanted to
grow in this section so getting rid of
three that I think that's great progress
and I will see you my next video bye
