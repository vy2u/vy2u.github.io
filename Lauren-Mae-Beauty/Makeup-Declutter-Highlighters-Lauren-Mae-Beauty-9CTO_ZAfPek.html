here to go through and declutter I don't
honestly have a ton of highlighters I
don't think I mean it could be worse I
guess is how I look at it so I'm gonna
go through these and try to get rid of
some stuff see what I can do make a
little bit of a plan here so let's get
into it
this is the Too Faced candlelight glow
highlighter I'm gonna be keeping that
one I love this it was in my top five
this is a mini of the Stila kitten
highlighting duo I'm gonna be keeping
this this is in my project to use up at
the end of the year and a little sneak
peek I did hit pan on that one that was
on my goals this month so this is
another one in my project pan you guys
probably heard me complain about it a
million times its benefits what up
what's up I am using this one up this
year as well so I'm not going to get rid
of it because I'm going to use it
sticking with benefit this is Girl Meets
pearl by benefit I have not used this
but hi it is just a small little sample
so I kind of just want to use it up
instead of just getting rid of it and I
have had it for quite a while so I think
I'm gonna use keep this and like use it
underneath foundation or something as
like a luminous type of glow I'm gonna
keep it though and try to use it up this
year
this is high-beam by benefit I'm also
going to keep this just because it's
such an iconic product I just don't want
to get rid of it
and I just want to be able to use it if
I want to I love that this is like a
pinky highlight because I feel like a
lot of highlights are golden and I
personally like a more pinky highlight
on myself so I'm gonna keep this and try
to get some use out of it and just have
it on hand this is not going as well as
this is a Tarte little cheek stain but
it's a highlighting color that's what it
looks like there I think I'm also gonna
keep this one I know that seems sounds
crazy but I did just buy this like
during Christmas so I would like to try
to use this out this is the RMS
illuminator
I have heard it's called the living
Luminizer I've heard so many great
things about this I actually got this in
a box that me and Sam gave each other
for Christmas it's a pop sugar mystery
box and we each gave it to each other
I've heard such great things and I
really haven't even used it yet so I
think I'm gonna keep it
I know Meg's make up eight like loves
this she's obsessed so I feel like I
should give it a good try so I'm gonna
keep this one this is the Josie Maran
liquid illuminator I'm gonna be keeping
this this is like everyone's favorite
liquid illuminator like if they have a
favorite this is it I just put out so
much but it's beautiful and it is gold
but I think it's really nice so I'm
gonna keep that so I've kept all the
liquid even though I shouldn't okay this
is the Mac cream base in the color pearl
this is like one of my first Mac
products ever um everyone just like rave
was raving about this when I bought it
and that's why I wanted it um I think
I'm gonna keep this for now maybe put it
in my kit yeah nothing's wrong with it
um I just I can't see say no to this I'm
quite yet so I'm gonna keep this we're
back to square one guys I'm just keeping
