eyeshadow palette I am going to go
through and declutter these I honestly
have filmed this video once and it shut
off halfway through and I didn't realize
it so a lot of the palettes weren't in
there so I kind of have already gone
through these and too cluttered um some
of them so I'm going to just go through
show you what I have show you what I'm
going to get rid of and hope hopefully
maybe I can get rid of one more ballot
than I was expecting to I'm gonna try
really hard to get rid of one more that
I didn't and the other one now that I've
had some time away so that's gonna be my
goal let's get into it
we'll start off with this small one
first just because it's small and I'm in
a different location obviously I'm on my
coffee table just because I want it to
be some more different I guess I'm on
the ground sitting which is more
comfortable for me the first pallet here
this is the tarte not neutralized -
pallet volume - yeah I got this off the
charts website a really long time ago
and in the last one I did get rid of
this I'm still gonna get rid of it
I've used this a lot when I first got it
but I just don't use it now and not that
the quality of the shadows is bad or
anything I just don't need it
and there's other palettes out reach for
more over this so I'm gonna be getting
rid of that one this is the lorac
afterglow palette and I'm not going to
be getting rid of this one that's what
it looks like the colors in here are
super pretty and they're very summer
esque so I will be keeping this palette
and yeah
keeping this is the Smashbox blue eyes
palette I got this at a CCO out here in
California when I came one time before
we moved out here and this is going to
be in my maybe pile of getting rid of I
think the shadows in here are great they
swatch beautifully they are very
pigmented and they do help make your
blue eyes look blue but I just haven't
reached for this as much as I really
want to oh but they're so nice I don't
know I'm going to put it in the maybe
pile for now this is one of the ones I
potentially might get rid of this this
time around will see this palette right
here is it called
it's naturally pretty palette this is an
all matte palette and then there's like
a transforming pearl color here I'm
gonna keep this palette I have not used
it very much you can tell you can see
all the imprints still and I want to get
some more use out of it before I make a
decision on if I like it or if I don't
if I should pass it or not so I'm going
to keep this one for now this is a Laura
Mercier palette I honestly don't know
the name of it I think it's something
artistry I am going to be keeping this
palette I absolutely love this palette I
use this one we went to France and the
colors in here are just absolutely
beautiful this African violet color it's
just stunning I love it I like that a
lot of these shades are actually
permanent so if you wanted to try out
some of Laura Mercier's eyeshadows you
could try this and you're getting a way
better deal for your money so I will be
keeping this palette this is a NARS
narcissus dual intensity eyeshadow
palette I just got this for my birthday
this January so I will be keeping it
I like these shadows quite a bit Amalia
is one of my favorites from the palette
and yeah I'm keeping that this is the
NARS narcissist just regular eyeshadow
palette I bought this because I just
couldn't resist passing it up and
honestly I do not get as much wear out
of it as I wish I would I'm going to
keep it because I'm not going to
probably ever get rid of it it's just so
expensive I'd rather just like use it up
type of thing but this is definitely one
that wasn't the best purchase I've ever
made type of thing but I will be keeping
it so I can get my money's worth out of
it this is the tarte golden days and
sultry nights palette I bought this and
I do not know why I told myself Lauren
you don't need it you don't need it
don't buy that why you're gonna buy that
and I bought it and I regretted it even
though I knew I would I don't know what
I was thinking I've never used this
palette I'm going to be passing it along
the colors in here are beautiful this is
the only one that's just kind of lame to
me it just doesn't swatch very nicely
for what I would want but it is a
beautiful palette it's just there's no
reason for me to keep this honestly
since I've never used it so I will be
passing that one along this is my Urban
Decay oz the great and powerful
glenda the goodwitch palette
bought this off of Urban Decay's website
after this was already released quite a
while ago for only $20 and I jumped on
it because I was kind of sad I didn't
get these when they were out I'm going
to be keeping this I love the idea of
this palette and how you can pop shadows
in and out do it on camera see how that
pops out and then any of their single
eyeshadows that they now have is in
packaging or you could pop them back in
here so I love that about it but I just
love this palette I think it's great so
I will be keeping that one I have two of
the Stila new palette this one is the
soul palette right here and this is
really beautiful I love this palette
easy for my wedding so I'll be keeping
that one and then this one is the mind
palette which I've just got as well and
I will be keeping this too so I'm going
to be keeping both of those palettes I
think they're great quality they're
great additions to my collection I have
two more of steel' --is like cardboard
palettes this one here is the Stila for
Kardashian Khaos I don't know where this
when this came out or what collection
I'm guessing like some type of
Kardashian thing but I got this off
their website for I want to say like ten
dollars or something it's absolutely
beautiful this heart color is so pretty
so shimmery it looks pretty similar to
kitten I just love all of the shades in
here I think this is an absolutely
beautiful just everyday neutral palette
I love how big the pants of eyeshadow
are so I will be keeping this one this
is steel as the natural palette um I
really like this palette but there's
something about it that I don't like I
don't know for so long I was lusting
after this palette and it just isn't
that amazing to me I think I'm going to
put this in the maybe pile
to get rid of only because I've had it
for a while I really haven't used it and
I feel like it could go somewhere else
and get more use in the shades that are
in here I honestly probably have
somewhere else I just I don't know it's
and I don't know
that's exactly the right name for it so
I'm gonna put it in the I don't know
palette pile and I don't know pile so we
are done with the small pallet and we're
going to be moving on to this big huge
guy it's a lot in here I warned you guys
so the first one here in that one is the
Kat Von D star studded pellet I believe
it was called this came out with the
Christmas collection our holiday
collection 2014 I have never even
touched this palette it's so sad but I
will be keeping it I want to use this
one up I wanted I wanted this pellet so
bad and my mom got it for me for
Christmas and I really just need to use
it I think the shades in here I'm really
pretty I love that you can obviously use
them however you want but they kind of
did put them in quads for you just to
help you you know come up with looks and
I'm keeping it I just need to use it
this is the bombs meet Matt um I've had
this for quite a long time I got it off
of I believe hautelook and I have really
never used it I don't know what it is
about these shadows that I just don't
gravitate toward the Matt's in here the
quality of them is great
but I just never reach for it so I'm
going to be passing this on along I
don't need this I've never used it I
don't need it so I'm passing that one
this is Anasazi as my amia palette I
absolutely love this palette I'm so glad
I got this one and I will be keeping it
the warm tones in here are absolutely
beautiful this color Clisson is so
pretty it's beautiful keeping that one
this is another Anastacio Beverly Hills
palette that I have I don't know how to
say that so I'm not going to but I am
going to be keeping this palette as well
this one is so pretty
I love this shade here this like darker
burgundy color they're just great
shadows so I'm going to be keeping this
one and then I have one more palette but
this one I will be getting rid of this
is the catwalk palette and the shades in
here are just ugly to me um I don't know
why I wanted to pick this one up
I've never used this palette I don't
really want to use this palette I feel
like all these shades look the same
these two look the same as each other
just to me I don't feel inspired when I
look at this palette so I will be
swing this on I like really warm tones
and that is not I have all three of the
naked palettes I'll be keeping all of
those I have another Anasazi Beverly
Hills this is the lavish palette but
I'll be keeping this one I think this
one's beautiful as well so keeping that
one I have two Tarte palettes in this
form this is the Tarte tartlet palette
this just came out pretty recently i oh
you can see all the camera um this
palette is really pretty I'm going to be
keeping this one since I did just buy it
I actually bought this when it was like
pre released on their website instead of
that Sephora but I honestly have not
used this I need to use it more I just
haven't
and then this palette is aqua lilies for
Tarte I'm going to be keeping this one
as well I honestly have not used this as
much as I thought that I would but
something about this palette is still so
beautiful and I'm going to keep it
around and try to get some use out of
that one this is the Kat Von D Esperanza
palette I just did a collaboration video
with his palette and I think it's
absolutely beautiful the look that I
created I absolutely loved so I'm going
to be keeping this one I just think the
colors are so fun and pretty these are
two of the Kat Von D like metal cased
palettes this first one here is the st.
one I have never even used used this
ever I think I'm going to put this in
the maybe pile the shades in here are so
stunning but I've just never used it so
then it's like why wouldn't I try to
like finish up ones I have already
started using instead of like busting
out this whole new palette I could give
to someone
do you not I'm saying I don't know so
I'm going to put this in the maybe pile
for now this is the Kat Von D Lady Bird
palette I will keep this one because I
absolutely love it I haven't used it a
ton but the colors in here are so
amazing I think these are great because
they're all mattes and the color
selection is just so on point for this
palette you have highlights you have
transitions you have warm tones cool
tones some really nice deeper colors
that I feel like don't always come in
matte colors like that Navy and that
purple so I think it's just great I love
it and I'm going to be keeping that one
this is a two-faced
chocolate bar palette I have the old
packaging because I got it when I first
came out I'm going to be keeping this
one although I don't find that this is
like my favorite palette ever um I love
it I mean I like this palette but I
would prefer the naked oh and the lorac
palette over this one personally um yeah
that's just me though so anyway I will
be keeping this one though I'm not going
to get rid of it I like having it but
you know it's not the one I recommend
out of all those this is the Kat Von D
monarch palette I love this palette I
will be keeping this beautiful shades
love it love love love this is the
interstellar palette from Kat Von D now
I was contemplating whether I was going
to get this one or not because they are
very cool toned and um that usually
isn't my thing
but these are so pretty in those
lavender colors I could not say no and I
have been getting quite a bit of use out
of this on and off since I got it in I
think February so I will be keeping this
palette this is the Tarte reinforce
after dark palette I'm going to be
keeping this this is one of my favorite
palettes I think everything in this
palette just works well together came
out fall 2014 I think you can still
purchase it they like reap remoted it um
it was just such a huge success and I
think the color is just everything about
it we're just on point and I love it
I've gotten a lot of use out of this
palette so I will be keeping that one
this is the Urban Decay electric palette
I absolutely love this palette I know
there was some controversy around the
red pigment dyes in here whatever not
using around the eye I'm just not really
worried about that whole situation but I
love this palette I think it's great I
think the colors in here are perfect and
really I don't feel like there was a
palette on the market that had what this
has these do stain so be careful like
this is going to stay in my hand so I
would definitely use like a primer so
you can stop that as much as possible
but regardless I love this palette and I
won't be getting rid of it I'm keeping
that this is a two-faced palette this is
the sugar and spice palette this came
out this holiday season 2014 I really
like this palette I really wanted to get
it do I need this palette no I think I'm
gonna put this in the maybes because I
really don't need it
I love how thin it is this palette is I
think the pigmentation on these shadows
is great I really like to face shadows
in general but um again these are very
cool toned I feel like I should make
some decisions between this one and the
others I have in that kind of maybe pile
so I am going to put this in the maybe
pile even though it's so pretty yeah it
needs to go in there needs to go you
guys I'm telling you I'm doing so much
better I'm so surprised because these
are my favorite thing but I think I
realized too as much as I love to
collect him I really want to feel
passionate about them not like all right
there okay you know um I really want to
love all the palettes even if I had 100
I want to love all 100 instead of just
like kind of loving 150 if that makes
sense this is the Urban Decay vice LTE
palette I really don't know why I bought
this one but I did and I will be keeping
it I think the colors in here are
beautiful I just didn't need it I mean
it's beautiful but I just didn't need it
but I'm going to keep it and get my
money's worth um yeah I just really
don't need any Urban Decay palettes
anymore like really how many other
shades can they possibly make that I
don't have besides like duochrome ones
cuz I really want those ones um anyway
this is the vice 3 palette I bought this
this holiday season I think this palette
is just beautiful I definitely like this
one more than the Vice LTE palette the
colors in here I just think are just
better personally I just more me um and
I am gonna be keeping that one for sure
yeah there's only four left guys I'm
going to keep everything in here so I'll
just show you that this is the lorac
Gold palette I love this palette I
definitely need to use it more I did a
look with it when I first started my
channel and I think it's great this
shade is absolutely insanity it's insane
and I don't know if it's gonna hope it
shows up how insane it is it is so
pigmented and metallic like I can't even
believe I can't believe it I love this
palette I'm going to be keeping that and
then this is the lorac unzipped regular
palette and I absolutely love this one
as well this is to me better than the
Urban Decay Naked 3 palette I just like
the shades in here better than that one
but I'm going to keep both but I'm just
letting you know for you if you are
wondering I love that keeping it this is
the lorac pro 2 palette I love this this
is in like a favorites video recently
and it's just a great one I've gotten a
lot of use out of this and then this is
my lorac pro 1 the original and
obviously it has been well loved so I
will be keeping that as well
I mean I'm not even trying to pan this
and I hit pan on nude so um whoa those
are all those are all the palettes now
we need to kind of make some decisions
on those maybes I'm not I'm making the
decision on the maybes today I'm not
going to wait around and see what
happens type of thing like we're going
to get we're going to get these decided
on so I'm going to put away all the
palettes I have these palettes here
these are the ones that are in the maybe
pile and I would like to get rid of two
of them two of them have to go whoo okay
so I have to get rid of two of these
palettes and let's see what I want to do
oh it's so hard um I think I'm gonna get
rid of these two um I just yeah at least
for right now obviously if I don't use
these anymore you know I'm kind of know
what I'm looking out for I'm going to
keep these three and I'm going to be
getting rid of these two palettes as
well so Stila and this is to waste so
overall I'm getting rid of instead of
four pallets which is was in my original
one I'm getting rid of six so I feel
really good about that it's kind of good
I guess I had to refilm this video so um
recap getting rid of the the natural
palette by Stila I'm getting rid of this
sugar and spice palette by Too Faced I'm
getting rid of the Anasazi Beverly Hills
catwalk palette whoo I'm getting red of
the bombs meet matte palette I'm getting
rid of this tart sultry days Golden
Knights palette and I'm getting rid of
