Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing another declutter I
know I just got done with a huge
declutter series on my channel I will
have that linked if you haven't checked
it out but I've just decided to get rid
of some more stuff I am doing a tube
talk after this video today and I'm just
not as attached to my stuff anymore so
if things are getting older I'm not
using them I'm just declutter and moving
on and trying new things
overall think it's just that attachment
isn't there anymore it's just makeup to
me and it's okay to get rid of it if I
don't want it so I think that's why
these two clutters are becoming more
frequent and I'm letting go of more and
more things as I move forward so I have
this whole bag here of stuff which is
quite a bit I'm gonna run through it as
fast as possible because some of it is a
little bit I don't wanna say boring but
kind of but it's just so nice to think
that this much like massive stuff is not
gonna be my collection anymore the two
biggest things I'm getting rid of two of
these hand sanitizers I just got these
at the dollar store but I do not like
these hand sanitizers they just feel
like there's a film on my hands and I
hate that I really like ones that I get
at the dollar store but they're
different brands they're like a cure or
something so anyway I don't like these I
don't want them and I won't use them a
couple other big things just from the
top these are two color pop palettes
they don't have anything in them they
just hold the four pan I shadow and I
don't want these I have a ton of Z
palette and just bigger sized palettes
so I don't need this hanging around in
my collection I also have a Z palette
this is the double-ended one and I don't
know how this happened but it cracked I
was on set and it came back to my stuff
and it was all busted and broken and I
don't know I don't know how it happened
I don't know if like Annabelle came in
and just like eff stuff up or if it was
like one of the people from the show I
don't know but it totally got cracked
which is crazy and then I'm just getting
rid of two of these shadows these are
both from Coastal Scents one is gypsy
stone and the other one is M 22 they're
just old they're not colors that I use
they're a little bit powdery and I don't
want them whoa almost dropped everything
I'm so I'm gonna be getting rid of these
and just so you guys know anything I'm
declaring depending on where it's at and
its life I'm either tossing it if it's
really old or I will be passing this on
to people I know like my mom or friends
and family from Arizona or whatnot so it
will all go to a good home I won't be
selling any of it I don't sell my makeup
yeah let's get into some good stuff why
don't we okay let's do makeup first here
this is from pure this is the bear doll
foundation I had this in a recent
disappointing products video I will
leave that link down below as well I
just don't like this the mm-hmm know the
packaging is kind of cute with the
holographic thing going but it's also
really cheap and I just don't like the
feel of this on my skin oh just nothing
about this works for me sadly I really
wanted it to but it doesn't so I'm going
to just pass it on I'm not gonna like
mix it or do any of that I just have way
too many foundations to be messing
around with that more things in the
foundation realm this is from Jane Eyre
del it's a loose powder foundation it's
in warm Sanna so it's just too dark for
me I'm gonna pass that one on to my mom
I think it will work well for her she's
a bit darker and then I am gonna get rid
of this guys this is the Tarte Amazonian
clay powder foundation in light beige
again this is a little bit too dark for
me I've had this for forever
I've been wanting to use it up for
forever and I just never have and
there's a reason it's like I don't want
to use this I like other things and
honestly when it comes to my face I
really like to have what I want to wear
I don't want to wear things that don't
feel good or I look it in and right now
I'm into a more lightweight
natural look and I don't want to use
this and I don't think I will and it's
just old it's time to get rid of it and
it's okay it is okay let it go just
continuing to pull things at random this
is an eye primer from by Terry and this
is just getting old I do like this eye
primer but this is in the shade too and
I prefer the shade one it's just a
little bit dark and it doesn't leave
like a lighter base on my eye which is
what I prefer I've talked about this
before but I really think that the
Maybelline one that I've been using is
very similar to this it has that kind of
like almost like cooling mousse II feel
this has hyaluronic
in it so it's most like plumped the
eyelid it'd be great for like more
mature skin or someone who wants to have
more plumped up eyelids than wrinkly
ones I guess it's just getting old and
I'm not gonna get to use this for a
while so I thought I would just get rid
of it it has to go in the trash next is
a brow product this is from Rimmel and
it's the Born This Way at brows tiling
gel I had this in my disappointing
products as well this just doesn't work
for me
color wise I don't really like it and
the wand is just a little bit too big
it's just not my favorite and I have so
many other ones that I do like I don't
want to use this one up so I'm gonna
pass this one along it's really
inexpensive so if it works for you
that's awesome but I just didn't work
for me
I have quite a few lip products here I
have a color pop one this is any color
freshman I don't think they make this
anymore I did get this sent to me from
love Heatherette so thank you Heather
it's a pretty color I have worn it in a
video I just don't wear color very often
and I prefer my NARS pencils so I'm
gonna pass this one on I know I have
another color pop pencil in here
somewhere but we'll get to it when we
get to it I guess this next one is from
buxom and this is in the color under
estable yeah this is very very nude it's
pretty I just don't love this nude on me
I'm not really into really warm nudes on
me and this is quite light so I'm gonna
pass I'll probably just get rid of this
one I don't know how old it is autumn
sent me this one I feel bad I'm like
getting rid of all the stuff people sent
me but um I just have to be real with
myself either way I appreciate them
sending it to me but it's time for it to
move on next is a color whisper this is
from Maybelline these are discontinued
which is so sad I really like these it
still smells good like fruity pebbles to
me it's just getting old and it's time
for it to go I know I'm not gonna use it
up this one is super light it's in the
color bear to be bold and although it is
very sheer it's still like wiped out my
lips so it looks kind of creepy and I
don't want to wear it as like a night
bomb it's just time to go I think these
are the last two things from colour-pop
again these are sent to me from Heather
this one is the blush and prenup I
really wanted to try this out but
honestly I just haven't and I don't
think I will so I'm just gonna get rid
of it it was one of those things
was always on my list like I want to try
that I want to try that and I never did
so when she showed me this I was like oh
I can't wait to try it but it's just
something I never I never actually
wanted to try I guess
oh do you guys have things like that
where you finally get it and you're like
oh wait why did I want that the other
lippy is in the color of juicy and it's
a glossy finish I just don't really
prefer the glossy finishes and honestly
even the colour-pop lippie stix that I
bought myself the formula of them is
just not my favorite it kind of coops up
I like something a little bit more sheer
or like a gloss or just easier to wear
and these aren't quite easy even though
they're cheap they're not worth it to me
more lip products this one here is from
bite and it is two different nudes again
it's just too old especially for bites
type of product it's all natural and
like food grade and Lord knows I
shouldn't be eating this so I'm gonna be
tossing that one another thing I'm gonna
be getting rid of this one is from Dior
and it's a lipstick I don't know the
color of it but again it's just really
old and I was trying to use this up by
the end of the year but this just kind
of wiped out my lips as well I wish it
was in just a slightly darker color and
it would be perfect but because it has a
little bit of a sheen to it and it's a
bit lighter than my own lip color it
just looks weird so I'm not gonna finish
that up this is also in my disappointing
products video do you see a trend but
this is the insta ready full coverage
concealer from Physicians Formula I just
don't like this at all nothing about
this is good to me no the packaging sets
like again watch that video and you'll
know why I don't like half this stuff
this is something that surprised me this
is steel as kitten and I have it just in
a small little size I had this in my
makeup basket and I wanted to try it out
because I wanted to know like is it
still good and although it is a pretty
shadow it's like right here it's it is
really pretty I just have things that
are better than it like makeup geeks
foiled the shadows I have whimsical I
have starry eyed I have in the spotlight
I have magic act like all of those are
so much more metallic and I would use
them over this shadow so I don't know
why I have this in my collection anymore
if I really wanted to use it I do have a
that has it in it anyway so it's time
for it to go that one I'm really proud
of because honestly it's just sitting
there because it's d-list kitten not
because I'm gonna use it I only have
three more makeup items this next one
here is from number seven beauty and
it's a blush in the color soft dancin I
just don't use this it's a little bit
too pink I like something nude
I just don't reach for it there's
nothing wrong with this blush though
it's absolutely beautiful it's a nice
quality I like that it's a bit sheer and
you can build it up but I just haven't
given it the love that it deserves and I
don't think I will in the near future so
I'm gonna pass it on another one I'm
declutter after a long time of trying to
use it up this is the Becca ever matte
poreless priming Perfector I just don't
like this I don't like it on my skin
I've talked about it a million times it
feels like glue oh it makes me feel like
I have a mask on my face and I hate that
so I will not be finishing this up
although it is almost gone it was so
close but I don't it's not worth it I'd
rather have a nice feeling skin
something I enjoy wearing there's never
a time where I'm like who do I want to
torture myself today oh yeah sure I do
I'll use the becca product so it's time
for it to go there's no way it's gonna
get used up and last is something that's
just old this is the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills
I liked matte in pastel I would want to
repurchase something like this again
it's so pretty I got this when I was
working at the old beauty store I worked
at I think it's great for highlighting
the brow or highlighting the inner
corner I like the color of it it's like
a nice white pink it really does
brighten and I love that it's matte but
she's getting old and I don't know I
just want to get rid of it I just would
feel more comfortable repurchasing
something like this or even this exact
product then using the one I have and
that's a sign that it's time for it to
go the rest of the stuff in here is kind
of random I have some like skincare so
I'll go over that and then there's like
a bunch of brushes so I have a few
products from made simple skincare that
I'm going to be getting rid of I did a
whole review on them if you want to
check it out and know a little bit more
about the brand overall I do really like
the brand these specific products just
didn't work for me most of them because
they smell a certain way and I just
don't get on with them but the first one
here this is the face toner and orange
blossom bergamont
I will be passing these all on to my mom
hopefully she will like the smell and
can get some good use out of them this
next one is a face wash oil and
chamomile in Palmer Rosa this one was
the absolute worst offender for me when
it comes to smell I just I couldn't do
it so I will be passing that one on and
last year this is the face mask in Spur
ill spirulina hemp it's so hard for me
to say that my goodness I just did not
like this I was so excited to try a mask
that is powder and the neon water to it
and you put on your face but I didn't
like the way this layered on itself or
on my face it just got kind of clumpy I
didn't feel like I could get an even
layer of it and I just have other masks
I prefer to use I didn't really see any
results after using this so I'm not
gonna try to like use it up I'm gonna
pass it on while it's still new and
hopefully someone else can use it and
love it and really the last product in
here is my carbon cocoa again I have a
review on this so many videos will be
linked down below but this is a natural
teeth whitening paste well powder it's
like a charcoal powder it's black again
watch the video I even give a demo of me
using it so anyway I it just doesn't
work for me it's not something I like in
my lifestyle so I'm gonna pass it on to
my mom I know that she will love this
and she'll use it and enjoy it so why
not let her use it instead of it sitting
here and this is it just brushes left I
have a brush from a hoola product this
is from the hoola light that I just
bought I'm not gonna use it I have a ton
of little tart brushes that came with
different palettes and everything over
the years I don't really use these and
I'm trying to condense down my brushes
to just things that I love and just
better quality stuff so I don't need
these this is something that came in a
Sonia Kashuk collection this is just the
scratchiest brush ever I just don't like
it it's really cute but I also don't
like how thick the handle is it just
takes up a lot of room in my brush Cup
so I don't like that and I wouldn't use
it on set another super scratchy blush
brush or powder brush don't really like
it I don't need it and these are just
two randoms this is a steal one it's
cool it's fine whatever but this is just
kind of
and not a nice cut of the brush and this
is a little lip brush I believe from RMS
and I never use it so it's time to go
it's just gonna blunt to like I don't
know what you would use this for that is
everything for my declutter guys thank
you so much for watching I always help
that with the clutters it inspires
people just to like look through their
collections look through their items and
just get rid of things that they don't
need there is no use holding on to
products that you will never use I
promise it will not make you happy
anyway that's a whole nother story thank
you so much for watching stay tuned to
my tube talk it will be coming up
probably the next day after this video
but if not the day after that so I will
see you in that video thank you so much
for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
