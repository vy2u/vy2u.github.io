product videos de cluttering and this is
going to be difficult for me because I
have a lot of lip products but I don't
really use lip products so I need to get
rid of them but then it's hard for me
because I'm hoarding it also um bear
with me I'm going to be trying to get
rid of as much as I can out of these out
of here and be very realistic with
myself only because powder products you
can keep for a long time but lip
products and cream products and wax
products you really can't and I don't
use them I have a lot of lip stuff I'm
trying to use up in projects and I just
suck at it I suck really bad at using
them I put them in there and have good
intentions but then actually using of
the products really difficult for me so
let's get into these I'm really gonna
try to get rid of as much as I can
granted it's still gonna be large but I
just don't want it so large yeah I just
don't want it so large so I already know
I'm gonna get rid of all of these um tor
products what are these they're the
clean color family lipsticks they suck I
did a review they suck getting rid of
all of them
every last one um they're horrible the
next lipstick I have this is a Jordana
modern matte lipstick in the colour I
believe blush I'm going to be keeping
this I really like this lipstick I think
it's great so I've actually had this in
my drawer and used it this is a Revlon
lip color in the color pink palette and
it's matte I've never used it so I'm
gonna put it to the side and see what
other ones I have this is another matte
one in the color sky pink I'm gonna put
that to the side and see which one's I'm
gonna get rid of this is a L'Oreal color
in Jennifer's nude I really like this
nude color it's like a darker nude so
I'm gonna keep that when I just bought
this when we move to California so it's
not old or anything and I think it's
really on trend for what I've been
liking for my lips lately so I'm going
to keep that this is another matte red
another revlon matte lipstick this is in
the color really red I'm gonna keep this
a matte
lipstick is beautiful to have so I'm
going to keep that this is sleek's
mulberry I love this dark lip color I'm
going to keep that one this is one of
the maybelline vivid in the color
electric orange I think I'm gonna keep
that one I really like orange colors
like this same with this one this is
shocking coral and I really like that as
well I'm gonna keep it this is another
revlon matte lipstick this is in the
color matte fig I really like this color
I'm going to keep it I think I'm just
gonna get I'm gonna get rid of both of
those other ones I've just decided like
I don't really go for these types of
colors so I don't need them so I'm gonna
get rid of those too this is Max
Factor's hippy chic hippie something I
can't remember I'm gonna keep this one I
love this dark lip color this one I'm
also gonna be keeping this as a
covergirl one in the color I wish I
could tell you smitten I really like
this it's like a berry color I like that
one a lot I have two of the Maybelline
rebel bloom lipsticks I believe one is
blushing blood and the other is orchid
ecstasy I think I'm gonna keep both of
them just because I did just get them
yeah I'm gonna keep both of them for
right now just cuz they're they're new I
know that they're not gonna go old and I
really haven't given myself the chance
to use them this is another Maybelline
lipstick in the colour pink pleasure I
really like this color I'm gonna keep it
it's like a darker Lobby nude this is
another Revlon and they're all the same
this is Revlon's wine not in the matte
lipstick formula I'm and keep that as
well do you see a trend this is the
matte Maybelline lipstick and touch of
spice I will also be keeping this color
that is so pretty yeah keeping that one
I have this like nude one in the color
blushing beige I think I'm also gonna
keep that one have I gotten rid of
anything yet this is a wet and wild
color in the color blind date not that
this isn't a good color I'm probably am
just gonna get rid of it because I don't
need it you know and it's like cheaper
than all the other ones so I'm gonna get
rid of this one
just because I don't need it I have a
lot of the Revlon lip butters and I
really don't like these um I did when I
got them but I really find that they're
not my favorite formula so um I think
this isn't some type of project because
I didn't mark it so I'm gonna keep this
one just because I'm trying to use it up
I guess I don't know this color is in
sorbet I've like never used it you can
see so I'm gonna get I'm gonna get rid
of that one
this is in the colored wild watermelon
also never really used it um they're
pretty I don't know what it is uh about
them that I just don't really gravitate
toward I'm gonna only keep two out of
these so this is red velvet it's like a
glossy dark red color and this is candy
apple which is like a more true red
glossy color I think I'm going to keep
these two candy apple and wild
watermelon just because when I go dark I
usually like something matte so it stays
on so I'm gonna get rid of this one so I
got rid of two out of five of the Revlon
ones that's pretty good
this shouldn't be in here this is a baby
lips and I am trying to use this up for
the year so I'm keeping it but yeah I'm
trying to use it up because I don't want
it this is um wet and wild Fergie crest
Cabernet I'm gonna be keeping these I
think they're just great this one all of
the ones from this line I will be
keeping in my collection so all of these
Fergie lipsticks I have two more of the
revlon matte colors i have nude attitude
and smoked peach just gonna kind of see
what those look like
that one is smoked peach this one is
nude attitude I do not any new data to
that is so nude I can't
smoked peach is
pretty I think I'm gonna get rid of it
though I don't usually gravitate to
those colors Lauren you're doing so well
this is another one of those just like
wet and wild lipsticks I don't know why
I have this and the color I don't really
like so I'm gonna get rid of that I have
two of the Kate Moss lipsticks here this
one is in 113 it's very nude I don't
really need this one I'm gonna get rid
of that and this color is in 101 this is
quite pink for me but I don't know I
think I'm gonna get rid of it it's kind
of old I'm gonna get rid of that this is
airy-fairy by Rimmel I really like this
color I'm gonna keep it it's like a
darker nude color so I'm gonna keep that
I have three of the wet and wild like
$1.99 lipsticks here and I think I'm
gonna keep all of them although one of
them is broken but they are so pigmented
I used these when I was medusa for
Halloween this year that is like so
pretty yes and this last one I guess I
don't need this is the one that's broken
so I'm gonna get rid of it cuz there's
no need to have it this is the matte
lipstick from Maybelline in the color
less for blush I'm gonna be keeping this
one I just bought this while we were
here since we moved here so I'm going to
keep it
this is fairest nude by L'Oreal I just
bought this too when we were here so I'm
gonna keep that it's very similar to J
Lo's nude though it's like the same
color
I bought this lipstick in HD Magnolia
from Revlon while we were on our
honeymoon and I am NOT a fan of it I
like busted off the tip and I just don't
really like it so I'm going to pass it
along I don't like the way it smells too

stuff over this is smooth taupe although
it's very light I kind of like it I
don't know what maybe you can mix it
with something that's it there
