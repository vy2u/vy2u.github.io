the ones that I obviously haven't
reached for those ones I have because
they're in those places so I'm gonna go
through here and try to get rid of some
stuff I honestly don't know how
successful this one's going to be only
because I know a lot of this stuff and
stuff that I don't want to like
repurchase but I want to like use up
throughout the next you know year and
two years or so so I'm not sure if I'm
gonna just like get rid of everything in
here but let's just go through it and
see what kinda happens I don't know I
like a ton of baby lips I have so many
baby lips let's zoom in on these suckers
I have so many baby lips it's crazy and
I've also gotten rid of quite a few so
um I think personally I'm going to keep
these I think I'm gonna get rid of this
pink one though I don't really need that
color the rest though are all colors
that I kind of like and I'm gonna keep
those and try to work through them and
use them up okay I have a color whisper

up one of these jobs and this is a
second one I'm gonna keep these because
I am working through them oh here's
another doctor rescue I'm gonna get rid

keep this one and get rid of the more
pigmented one just because I'm gonna use
it like a lip balm I'm trying to use

normal color not like there's like a
coral one out now too but I just have
the pink one and then all the rest of
the things in here like the sugar lip
fresh balms I'm keeping all of them I
love them all um yeah actually I might
get rid of the plum one just because now
I'm gonna keep them because I like them
all I think they're great products if I
had to pick any lip balms tinted or not
I use these not baby lips so they keep
these so I'm gonna just keep putting all
the capers that we're selling their

were like a dollar 25 I have not even
tried really using them or anything so
yeah I don't know I kind of want to keep
them just because they're kind of crazy
and I think they're cool so I'm going to
keep them and then I'm gonna get rid of
this pop little thing I don't know I
don't I just don't need it I've never
really used it I like the nude one
better yeah and I'm doing great
I think I'm just like as I'm doing this
I'm getting more and more comfortable
letting things go it's like an exposure
exercise now that we have a clear one
alright in the last basket we have to go
through is this one so let's see what we
got I think most of this stuff is our
lip glosses so this is the buxom White
Russian I love this keeping I'm going to
keep all my buck sunglasses so I'm going
to keep these too

it I was trying to use this a little
and this the way it feels on the lips I
don't like I don't want it torture
myself and use this up I'd rather get
rid of it so I'm gonna get rid of that
I'm trying to use this up this year so
I'm gonna keep it

liquid lipstick type things I'm gonna
keep both I like both those colors this
is a Korres lip butter lip glaze in
pomegranate I'm trying to work through
the Jasmine one and I'm kind of
questioning do I want to work through

I'm just gonna get rid of it yeah I just
have so much Korres crap to go through
this is the Tokyo milk dark lip tint in
the get lucky or something that's it's
watched right there I'm gonna keep this
one I haven't really had the chance to
play with it and I want to so I'm gonna
keep it I have a bunch of these la girls
glazed lip paints I have only opened two
of them which is this one and this lunge
one um I think that I'm just gonna get
rid of yeah I really don't like them I
don't know why everyone else does I
don't think they're cool so I'm just
gonna keep the color that I actually
like I'm gonna keep this color and I'm
gonna get rid of these three and these
two aren't even opened so yeah I just
bought those and this is a coarse lip
gloss in the color natural purple I just
hate lip glosses I think I'm just gonna
get rid of it I would just rather use
lip glosses actually like and I like the
buck someone so why not use those ones
so I'm gonna get rid of it I don't care
if it's in a project okay
so I am keeping everything in here as
well as everything in here and then
these are all the things I'm getting rid
of so yeah I feel really good I cleaned
out a lot of lip products because before
I moved I cleaned out my collection
because I didn't want to move and take a
bunch of stuff I didn't want with me
plus I was gonna give a lot of it to
people at home like my friends and I
wasn't gonna like send it back to them
but I definitely have been able to deep
clean a lot more than I could then and
so feels good so I am going to do a nail
polish one of these next I think real
fast and yeah I'm gonna do nail polish
for sure and I might I think that's it I
think I'm just gonna do nail polish and
