inspired tonight to do you want to
cluttering video so that's what we're
gonna do I'm sitting here and I don't
have makeup on or anything like that so
it's wonderful you guys can't see my
face but I thought you know I just want
to go through it and if you get the urge
to get rid of makeup you probably should
just go with it
because I don't get those very often so
anyway these are all my single shadows
some of these might be duo's but they're
all in like the single format and I just
wanted to go through and kind of see
what I had and get rid of some stuff if
I feel the need I might not get rid of
anything but you know even if I get rid
of a couple things I think that's a win
so let's just get straight into this the
first one I have here this is the Kat
Von D duochrome
eyeshadow or shade shifter eyeshadow in
the color on the road I bought this in a
double set I can't even open it I bought
this in a double set from Sephora and
they were like two for 15 yeah I love
this color
the duo chrome on it is so spectacular I
will definitely be keeping this one this
one here is my covergirl this is in the
color yeah I can't oh mink this is in
the color mink I'm sorry guys
so that's what that one looks like it's
a pretty just basic color um I don't
know I think I'm gonna get rid of this
one honestly when it's watched there
next to it I mean it's pretty but mm I
just haven't used this and I've had it
for a long time so I'm gonna get rid of
this one this is another one I think
this is the only other color for girls
eyeshadow I have this is in the color
taupe Tapestry taupe this one was really
popular on YouTube awhile ago I did hit
pan on this shade so I have shown it
love in the past and um I think I'm
gonna keep this one looking at their
swatches actually I kind of like the
mink one better but I don't usually have
a lot of topi ones I don't gravitate to
those colors I like warmer color so I'm
gonna keep this one because they think
it's a good basic and it's drugstore so
that's nice
so let's keep that maybe I can throw it
in a project pan later on this is a star
looks I shadow I got this in one of the
boxes that I've okay this is gonna be an
issue so anyway this is a star looks a
shadow this is in the color pearl and I
really like this
I think the quality of it the
pigmentation on it is great it's like
this really nice satin so it doesn't
have a ton of shimmer to it but it does
have a nice Sheen so I think I'm gonna
keep that one I think it would look nice
on the brow bone if you weren't looking
for something completely matte but
something nice I don't know I like that
one I have this star dust urban decay
shadow which has pretty dang cool
packaging this is basically just like a
glitter bomb and a half I mean it's
insane um I don't know you can see it
there I mean the glitter on this is so
crazy and it doesn't even have a bunch
of pigmentation I think I might actually
pass this one along just because I do
have the new ones the reformulating ones
which aren't Stardust they're moon dust
and have a white shade so I'm gonna pass
this went on this isn't the color Bobby
dazzle so I'm gonna get rid of that one
I'm gonna zoom us in so we can see even
better the next two eyeshadows I have
here are the bomb shady lady ones and I
have the color mischievous Marisa and
that's that one I guess I'll just show
it it's a really pretty color it's like
a caramel E copper color and then this
one is in shameless Shawna and this is
like a similar color just a little
darker I just cannot deny the quality on
that I mean those look so nice I think
I'm gonna keep these but I do need to
show them love as you can see I have not
like I mean how's that been used I'm not
really sure so I want to keep these ones
but I definitely want to keep my eye out
for them in case they don't want them
again or like if I don't use them I can
get rid of them so we'll keep these
another drugstore want to have this
a Maybelline chic Naturals in the color
champagne now this one had a little
accident and I did have to repress it I
really do like this shade I don't feel
like it's been quite the same since I
had to repress it just because it's
pretty soft and I mean I'm not very good
at it but I think this one's really
pretty I like putting this all over the
lid and then just a really nice
transition color in the crease just for
a really glowy look but still pretty
neutral everyday in light I'm gonna keep
this one and I just like this one on the
keys I have this philosophy grace color
in heaven and her throw one I got these
at Big Lots and I think is only like
three dollars it is a really pretty duo
and that's it's watched there um this
shade is really close to that Maybelline
one I mean it's not as shiny and this
one is just whatever Brown so I think
I'm gonna actually pass this one along
as well I don't know I just I don't need
it I need to be stopping order and pass
things along I think I'm actually gonna
give a lot of this stuff to my friends
at school just because if they can use
it then at least someone can anyway the
next one I have here is this face front
I shadow of an apricot of this like you
can tell I really like these types of
colors they're like a little darker than
a champagne a little lighter than like a
rose gold like a proper rose gold that
is that one there I'm gonna keep that
one I just like it and this is so much
better than that mink one too so I'm
glad I got rid of that when I still feel
good about that decision this is the
infamous steal a kitten and I got this
in like a little kit and I like that
it's small I do have this in a palette
but I think it's nice to have this small
version as well and oh it's beautiful
it's so pretty I'm gonna keep that one
for sure this is from Ulta I actually
just got recently it's just a matte
transition brown color you can really
never have too many of these I thought
it looks really similar to naked from
the
- k-palette I think that's the color it
is it's not super pigmented but it is
pigmented it's just the light color I
don't know I'm gonna keep this one I
think this is a great like everyday type
of color this is in the shade camel if
you're interested if you're looking for
like drugstore priced shadow I would
check this one out it's pretty nice yeah
I'm keeping it I have these two Michael
Todd shades this first one here is in
the color juicy gossip and this one's in
the color pleasure I got these off of
all cosmetics wholesale and I they were
really cheap I think they were maybe
like $3 when I purchased them they were
definitely like kind of clearance
blowout that's it there I do like this
shade it's very sparkly I'm gonna keep
it and just put it in like the kind of
watch pile again kind of with those
other ones just because I don't know
this is the other one in pleasure just
to remind you and this is more like a
topi color this one definitely performs
better than that other one that's for
sure that's it up on the top I think I'm
gonna keep this one and actually I think
I'm gonna get rid of that juicy gossip
and just keep the pleasure one so juicy
gossip is going in the giveaway pile I
have a couple things from Laura Mercier
here the first thing I have this little
tiny night shadow in black carrot I got
this a couple years ago in a Sephora kit
that was like glitz and glamour during
the holidays this is a very pretty shade
it's like a black but it has so much
gold shot through it and that's
beautiful I'm gonna keep this one I just
want to use it and do some looks with it
but it's definitely really pretty I'm
gonna keep it it's too pretty and I
believe this is a baked shadow so I
could probably use this white as well in
it oh my gosh I'm so sorry look oh
that's so sick
I'm gonna keep this I'm gonna keep this
one this one here this is in the cult
color golden mosaic now I think you can
wear this this one has like a bronzer or
like a highlighter I put it in here
because I wear it I was like an
eyeshadow quad type thing the colors on
this
are really nice it is pretty dang
pigmented I really like it I think this
is perfect for like a summer look
there's just three of them swatch I
guess I'll swatch the last one since why
not go for it I really I mean these are
like the perfect colors and the tones
that I go for for looks that I do so I'm
gonna keep this one I just love how
compact it is too so keeping it okay I
don't know if it recorded this so I'm
going to talk about this is the
two-faced magic mushroom shadow I have
given this tons of love and it is just
so pretty that is it's watched I'm
definitely keeping this it is like this
pink that has gold shimmer running
through but it's very arid essent I love
this color and I will be keeping that
one this is one I definitely want to try
to use up before it goes bad type of
thing
this is smash boxes
this is like a really old shadow one of
the first ones I've ever collected when
I started doing makeup so that's it
there it's just an orange shimmery color
it's beautiful its watches wonderful
it's gonna look great on eyeballs
yes yes I'm keeping that one's a keeper
it's a keeper girls I've gotten rid of
for I know that's kind of sad so the
whole point of this is to get rid of
stuff but you know I have this galactic
shadow here this is in the color butter
shine I think yeah I love this shadow
this could even be used as like a
highlighter it's just too pretty it's
really pretty guys and this is just a
shimmery without being too in-your-face
has no glitter or anything like that and
I would love using this even as a
highlight it's just huge shadow too like
that's a lot so keeping that I have this
Urban Decay duo this is in the color sin
and mushroom um I really love both of
these colors I believe I have both of
these colors like in a couple different
places there's it kind of swatched out
um it's right here I think I'm gonna
keep this one in that like maybe pile
slash try it out and see if I use it
only because I just love that sin color
and I now have it in my Naked palette
and I think I have like a mini of it too
like that's a sore so hoarder of me um
we'll see if anything all passes along a
little later but I can't right now I
can't do it I have all of these Sephora
limited edition duo double reflect
colorful eyeshadows pounds in the color
mermaid tail this is in the color sirens
charm this is in the color sea horse
this is stormy seas this is iridescent
shell in the last ones hidden treasure
I'm keeping all those I just bought
these if you want to see a separate
video on these like with swatches or
something let me know they are limited
edition and they were sold only online
but yeah I'm keeping those because I
bought all of them recently
I also have quite a few of these
two-faced shadows this one is in the
color nude scene
this one's really it's not even in frame
at all that's it there it's really
really fair but I'm gonna keep it I just
I really like it it's gotten a little
beat up but I'm gonna keep that one I
don't know I like it this one is in the
color dirtbag it's a really shimmery
really pigmented brown color well it's
kind of purply though too
I'm gonna put this in a maybe pile so
that way if I don't want it I can get
rid of it later this one here is in the
color Neptune I don't know I don't think
that's that pigmented I don't I'm gonna
get rid of this one I kind of it hurts
me to do that
but I just I don't know I didn't think
that's watched very well it's very
iridescent and not very pigmented and I
feel like I have something like that so
this one is saying goodbye to us and
then this one here is the color temper
temper and I am not getting rid of this
one this is like probably my favorite
one it looks a little bit more purpley
red but it is just beautiful yes yes and
keeping this one for sure
this is another one by Urban Decay this
is in the color freakshow and it's just
a purple a purple color it is crazy
pigmented that's really pigmented I'm
gonna keep it for now but it is kind of
the one of those ones in the think about
a pile only because I really haven't
used it at all
it's kind of freaky that's kinda freaky
right like I think it's what so cute but
I don't know it's like weird to me
anyway um yeah I'll keep it for now this
is like a steal uh in the color center
stage it's the countless color pigments
I bought so many of these because add a
layer on HauteLook or they were
somewhere for like $2 a piece and I went
insane this is like one of those ones
that has like colors all over it and I
seriously I've given gone rid of so many
of these I don't know I mean those I
think those colors look really pretty
altogether I like that you kind of get
this like purple and pink color when
it's all together I'm gonna keep this
and put it in the like let's try it out
I don't know um it's pretty I might try
to do a like a tutorial or something
with this one too so I'm gonna keep this
one for now but it's on my radar if I
don't use it you have this all looks so
pretty together I don't know man that's
pretty this one here is an infallible
L'Oreal infallible in amber rush
everyone knows what this looks like it's
been really highly raved about here on
YouTube so pretty I'm gonna keep that
one and it's the only one I have
I would like to get some more but I just
haven't yet
oh my nails are so bad I can't believe
I'm doing a video with the closest
close-ups of my freaking nails like what
boring what the Freak are you doing
anyway keeping them out oh I have
another one of these two-faced ones I
didn't see it in there
this is sitcom siren and this is like a
topi topi show you I'm gonna keep that
one too it's pretty and last in the
bucket are all my color pop shadows I
think I'm gonna do a separate video on
these so I'm not gonna swatch them all
here I have 12 of them here so I'm gonna
keep all of these for sure and probably
do a separate video so I'm not gonna
waste our time now so just a little bit
of an overview everything in this basket
I am gonna be keeping it's definitely
less full than it was so that's good
we'll put that to the side these items
here so 1 2 I have 6 items that I'm
going to be thinking about them in like
the kind of transition pile so I will be
thinking about getting rid of these
using them or not using them or whatever
and then these 5 shadows I am actually
going to be getting rid of um yeah I'm
excited about that
5 is not a ton but it is better than
none and I'm gonna take it I'll take it
if I can so this is just my single
eyeshadows so I will see you guys in my
next video I'm gonna probably keep doing
a couple of these but I think if
I might even go paint my nails right now
I just do another one like that so
pathetic but yeah anyway I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
