my decluttering of all of my what I
consider smaller eyeshadow palettes so I
have quite a few of these as well I
recently got like all of these so those
are quite new to my collection I usually
am NOT a small eyeshadow palette girl
I just don't gravitate to small palettes
I'm just gonna go big or go home type a
thing that's just my style so I want to
go through these just kind of get
reacquainted declutter what I can I
think there's a couple things I can get
rid of I'm not sure how much again I'm
not gonna do that disclaimer in every
video where you know the drill so let's
just get into this and start to
cluttering some of these eyeshadows the
first thing here is this eyeshadow from
bareMinerals this is a duo in the color
the phenomenon I got this from Sephora
for Black Friday it was only ten dollars
and it came with like a little lip gloss
as well um I don't know how I feel about
these shadows I I was so excited to get
them and then there's just something
that's just not quite doing it for me
with them so um I think they're
beautiful shades I even like them as a
combo I don't know what it is that makes
me just not like them but I'm going to
pass this on which feels really weird
cuz this is a newer thing in my
collection but I really just haven't
used it I mean I haven't even taken out
the little sponge applicator and that's
usually the first thing to go so I'm
gonna pass this one along somehow do
something like they get it out of my
collection this is a little lamb comb
like gift with purchase type of deal I
really like all the colors and here's
why I'm gonna keep this one I have
gotten some use out of it as well it's
just a really great one it's great for
traveling it's small its compact and I
really like all the colors and how they
work together so I'm gonna keep this one
this is my NARS duo in the shade
Kalahari I love this it's so beautiful
it's the only one I have in like actual
packaging and I'm going to be keeping it
of course I have three of the wet and
wild color icon 3 pan palettes this
first one here is limited edition this
is camera obscura I have not even
used this yet I don't even know if i've
swatched it there's something about
these colors I just really like I love
this brow bone color I think that'd be a
pretty transition this would be also
beautiful I would love to see like a
smokey eye with this blended out with
that and in that in like the upper
crease as a warm smokey I'd be beautiful
so I'm gonna keep this one I just think
it's too pretty this is the walking on
eggshells trio and I absolutely love
this one this one right here has to be
my absolute favorite color there's just
something about that sparkly champagne
paint color I can't say no to and I will
be keeping that one as well this one's
in the color silent treatment and I
honestly I don't know if I need this one
I love that purple each hope though I
can't I don't know I'm gonna keep this
one as well I think these just work well
too together as a trio I think they pair
their things really nicely so I'm going
to be keeping that as well so nothing to
giveaway there this is a NYX eyeshadow
trio in the color nude taupe and dark
brown I don't know that's all it says on
the back that is what it looks like
there these are I believe just continued
now but the quality of these shadows is
quite nice I think I'm gonna keep this
just because I think it's a great
overall like said I just really like it
but I'm gonna kind of put it in the
watch pilot for Donna just because I'd
haven't used it in a long time but I
have used this quite a bit before so I'm
gonna keep that as well
all of these are enabling eye studio
quads I have quite a few of them again
these are recent purchases I love them
all I'm going to be keeping all of them
a lot of them are limited edition ones
that I've found on websites or whatever
and I just think they're great quality
I'm going to be doing I can make a
basket and having like a couple in every
single like bi-weekly one just so I get
some good use out of them the way that
they paired these colors I just love it
I think that they do such a good job I
wish there were more mats but I just
love the color combinations
of these.its they're just beautiful I'm
not gonna sit here and swatch them all
because we'd be here for like ten years
but they're all beautiful and if you
guys want to see a separate video on
just those I'd studio quads like me just
swatching them to music with close-ups
or something let me know I can
definitely do that for you to see you
guys if you you know wanted to make the
investment even though they're not
expensive I think I paid like six
dollars and under for all of all
individually for all of them because I'm
not gonna pay regular price cuz I I
think ten dollars for a little eyeshadow
quad is just a psycho
anyway if you guys would like that just
let me know in the comments down below
and I could definitely get that video up
for you and I'm just gonna put these
aside so they are out of the way and you
know what upon further just deliberation
I am gonna get past this one along I
think it's so pretty but I I usually
don't go cool toned and I already have
shades like this if I wanted to so I'm
gonna pass it I'm gonna pass it along I
have through the Wet n Wild eight pan
eyeshadows here these two I don't
believe are limited edition this one is
the comfort zone which is oh so popular
I did accidentally drop mine and so it
is a little crushed over here and also
here I'm gonna be keeping this I think
this is a great palette I honestly have
not used it that much but I think it's a
great drugstore option and I definitely
want to keep it in my collection this is
the drinking a glass of shine this is
all matte and definitely gonna be
keeping this I think these are kind of
crazy colors but this side I mean that's
like a high-end awesome matte palette
right there so I will be keeping this as
well I think these are great shades that
will be saying and then this is a
limited edition one that I got I think
off of all cosmetics wholesale I'm
telling you I know I talk about it a lot
I'm sorry guys but this is the walking
the red carpet palette and I'm gonna be
keeping this although I will say like
this shade is like really crazy and
flaky gold I didn't think that this one
performed as well as I feel like I
expected it to based off of past pallets
but I definitely still think it's
beautiful and I am going to be keeping
it
have two of these two faiths like round
little pallets this first one here is
called the it's from the natural beauty
collection I don't know I got this off
of you guessed it it has the bronzer
here and then two super beautiful
eyeshadows this one here and I just
can't let go up it's so beautiful I
think this is a great little package set
here I will be keeping this 1/4 short
and this one is the pixie perfect
palette this one is also so beautiful I
don't know why I haven't used this the
quality of these it's they are so smooth
that would be a great transition color
this one all over the lid ah please
Lauren what are you doing why aren't you
using these they're so pigmented I mean
and this is an older palette so I mean
they were bringing it from the get-go
here I really like this and I will be
keeping this palette as well I
definitely want to bust this out a lot
more and use it it's just so pretty I
mean so beautiful this is an urban decay
palette that I actually made myself so
inside of here are all of the new moon
dust IR Stardust or do they call them
now one they used to be Stardust now
their moon does something I'm pretty
sure their moon dust now and not start
us but these are absolutely beautiful I
love them all this one right here is one
of my favorite shades this is solstice
oh it's beautiful it's like a dual crumb
all of these are supposed to be duo
Cromie but I don't know if you can catch
how this is like catching blue and the
light yes anyway I love all these I'm
not going to be getting rid of them I'm
just showing you these ones for sure and
I really want to get the new ones that
are out if you know what I'm talking
about you know what's up this is urban
decay a little mini palette I got this
as a 500-point perk from Sephora I was
like saving up my points or something
awesome and this came along and I said
that is something awesome I really like
all the shades in here I'm gonna be
keeping this I think it's a great little
travel palette and you could definitely
do something really dark something
really daytime yeah
keeping that this is an
smoky palette I got this in like a hip C
or something I honestly haven't used
this that much because it's just so dark
and I'm usually more of a natural type
of girl um I think I'm gonna keep it
though just because I really don't take
these shades in my palette like I don't
collect these types of shades very often
and so I thought it would be kind of
cool to have
I especially really like this shade just
all over the eye is like a one shade
color um but yeah I'm gonna be keeping
it I kind of like it I don't know I'm
gonna keep it maybe keep it on a watch
list but I think it's nice I'm gonna
keep that this is a pop beauty palette
that I have I got this oh so long ago I
gave my mom one as well when I got this
and she has already hit pan on like four
of the shades and I've never used it so
I will be passing this along the
pigmentation on this is absolutely like
it's wonderful I just have not like look
I mean there's nothing wrong with this
palette for some reason I just haven't
used it and I just know that since I
haven't I got seriously only swatch this
why not let someone else have something
that's basically brand new and enjoy it
and love it just as much as my mom or
anyone else could you know so I'll be
passing this one along this is the naked
basics by Urban Decay I love this
palette I don't have the two I just have
the one and I am NOT getting rid of that
it's just a great basic imagine this is
a Physicians Formula nude palette I used
this quite a bit there's something about
this palette that makes me not want to
get rid of it although I don't feel like
it is anything that extraordinary the
packaging is absolutely adorable um I
wasn't expecting to get rid of this one
I kind of wanted to keep it actually but
it's just so shimmery and I feel like I
do have these shimmer shades I also
don't like that they're all stuck
together I think I'm gonna pass on this
I wasn't expecting to say that you know
there's some you thought you were gonna
get rid of and then you're actually dead
like this one's when I didn't and I am
getting rid of so this one I'm gonna
pass on I just I don't think I'm gonna
reach for this over other shimmery
like I have the shimmery shades I like
out of here and other things so goodbye
are you cutie this is my smashbox
Santigold collaboration palette I chose
to get though orange one I absolutely
love this
I think this palettes so beautiful this
shader here it's gorgeous it's so pretty
I don't know it's the whole thing I love
the colors the pigmentation I do feel
like that's a lot of black I wish that
the black was in the eye and that color
was out there or something but you know
what are you gonna do I think it's a
great palette though I think you can
make some really awesome looks with it
and I'm keeping it I just love the
packaging everything about it's just
beautiful so it will be staying and look
at that packaging it's so cool this is a
Physicians Formula palette I will be
keeping this isn't classic nudes these
are all matte shadows and they are
absolutely gorgeous if you're looking
for mattes at the drugstore this is
absolutely wonderful you get this really
nice warm tone shade a nice highlight
like really soft transition and then
this sounds like a little more cool tone
I just think they're great the quality
on these I mean they don't look like
this watch every night but they are
really nice especially for transition
colors from the drugstore so I will be
keeping this one for sure this is the
wet and wild greed palette I did get
this I think from a website I didn't buy
this like when they were out I just
wanted it for these mats here I will be
keeping this I think it's a great
palette yeah this is a good one a lot of
people really like this and it's because
it's pretty dang awesome especially for
a drugstore I feel like it was like
above its before its time like that
shade everyone loves it and it's there's
a reason it's beautiful so I'll be
keeping this one this is a little becca
trio this is in loss this is the Lost
Weekend palette I got this off of all
cousin axilla sale this is it there this
is a really pretty palette this is very
like subdued I will not be getting rid
of this but I thought I'd swatch it for
you that's it they're just really pretty
two of the colors are matte and this one
is like has a little bit of sparkle to
it but it's just agree everyday
type of palette I think it's really good
you could do a smokey eye like have this
on the lid and blend out you could do
this on the lid and like in the crease
whatever you want so really are just a
great one this is the last one I have
here this is a Dior one and I got this
from Sam's sister she loves to give me
makeup we give each other makeup for our
birthdays like usually every birthday
and she went all out on this one she got
me this in like a Dior lip gloss like I
was like girl you're crazy I've never
had to her before but when she bought
this for me I haven't used it I don't
know what I think because they're
purples I don't know why I haven't used
it it's so pretty that's just some
swatches there it's just it is a
beautiful palette I'm definitely not
getting rid of it I think of like Plum
fairies and just everything beautiful I
think some spring looks would be really
pretty with this and this one here is a
line or just a wow I break it no that's
a liner though I just think it's
beautiful and I will not probably ever
get rid of it I don't know it's my first
one and I like it so I will be keeping
all of these palettes as well as all my
Maybelline eye studio ones and these are
the four I'm gonna be getting rid of
that's more than I thought so I think
that's super successful I really only
thought I was gonna get rid of two and I
got rid of four double it yeah that's
everything guys sorry for heard any
creaking throughout this video that's
just how the neighbors upstairs out they
just creak around all the time
it's horrible um anyway I'm gonna go now
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
