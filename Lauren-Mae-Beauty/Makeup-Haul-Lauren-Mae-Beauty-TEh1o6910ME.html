video is gonna be a haul video we are
gonna look at some makeup stuff that
i've got i ordered a lot of stuff before
we moved into our apartment here in
California I ordered some stuff and I
always get it sent to my mom's house
even though I had my own apartment there
in Arizona so when my mother and Allah
came and visited us for the weekend she
brought me a bunch of packages that were
at my house so I got a lot of makeup
that I've been waiting to get plus i
bought in a couple things here and there
at the drugstore so i wanted to show you
what makeup i have been purchasing so
that's what this hall is going to be and
then i'm also going to do another hall
on just other stuff I bought I've bought
some candles I shouldn't have and i also
bought a couple of just like fun random
stuff i thought it'd be fun to show like
home decor and stuff but this is going
to be the makeup one so i'm going to
just get straight into the video and
show you guys what i bought recently
this is the Urban Decay advice LTE
pallid it's supposed to be like ultra
limited edition or that's at least how I
understood it I wasn't gonna get this
palette but I heard that girl shakes Oh
talk about at a time and then I was like
no still and then when it came out at
Ulta cuz they've relaunched in ulta com
I was just randomly woke up I think it
was a Sunday I woke up and I was like
I'm just gonna check if they have it
they probably don't it's probably sold
out and it wasn't sold out so then I was
like that means that i should buy it
because it's meant to be so so that's
what I did this is what it looks like on
the inside it looks like just like all
the other rice pallets it's really
pretty um I don't regret buying this but
I don't think it's something you need
it's definitely for me a collector's
item and I'm excited to use these shades
I do like that the Vice palettes have a
lot of neutral shades and then they just
have some pops of color in there I'm
excited to use it i like the brushes
that come with it i know some people
don't but that's what it looks like if
you guys were interested and i don't
think you can get anymore so i'm sorry
if you wanted it and you didn't get it
or if now you want it because i'm
showing it to you but that is something
that i purchased so i didn't want to
leave it
the hall another pallet type thing that
I bought this is actually my favorite
weary favorites but this is a palette
that I bought off of etsy it is like a
double-sided palette so there's shadows
on this side and this side and when you
close it they don't like hit each other
or damage each other and I picked this
material out myself on the website or on
her etsy site you can pick out which
like coverings you want and she makes it
for you this is homemade but it's such
great quality i was totally over the
moon once i got this i was really
excited about this and so sad that i had
to wait so long to get it not because it
doesn't ship in a decent amount of time
but because it's just been sitting at my
mom's house but i'm so glad to have this
this is my everyday pallet it's my
palette I picked it I picked the way it
looks on the outside and I picked the
way it looks on the inside I was
thinking about maybe doing a video on
all the shadows of my everyday eyeshadow
palette so if you guys want to see that
let me know but I'll probably just woman
anyway because I don't have that many
subscribers so I just do what I wanted
this point um but yeah I really like it
and I can't catch enough fat I really
like this obviously it was in my
februari favorites I picked up a couple
of the LA girl lays lip pains because i
was at albertsons and they had to
display of them and i haven't seen them
in any stores but I saw them in a store
finally and I've heard so much about
these I've heard great reviews on these
and I wanted to check them out myself I
have not opened this one this is the
color coy and this is the color babydoll
those two I haven't opened i bought
these products because they're supposed
to be like the two face melted lip
products but I've only opened these two
and i'm not sure how i feel about them
yet i need to give them a better chance
but i did buy these and i just wanted to
kind of check him out see how they were
a girl at makeup school I already have
friends guys um a girl at makeup school
told me that they're great she has all
the color so I wanted to try them and
then once I saw them in albertsons I was
like perfect i'll try them out to more
lip products that I've gotten these are
maybelline's rebel bloom lipsticks I
have the color blushing bud and orchid
ecstasy it's his budding blood buddy
blushing bud this one's blushing bud and
that one's orchid fantasy I heard mixed
reviews about these but I just love the
packaging
and I couldn't resist so I picked these
up just to see how they are and really
excited for this color for spring and
even this one's just a great everyday
color we'll see how I like them how they
work on the lips and everything also
while I was just at the drugstore I
picked up this kate moss by Rimmel
little eye shadow stick this is in the
color rose gold I'm pretty sure yeah
rose gold basically the name made me get
this because I love rose gold that's
it's watched right there it's really
pretty it's gonna be great I think for
like a bronzy gold I for summer I just
really like this they have a blue
wanting the line I think came with four
colors but there's a blue one and
emerald wide and some other color but I
really want the blue one so bad but I
have an urban decay I pencil like it so
I'm trying to resist but I really want
to get it we'll see you might see that
soon but um yeah this I'm pretty sure
these have the same formula as the other
ones so I'm thinking of these won't
crease on my eye but i'm not for sure
yet so hopefully that it's good and then
last time I Hall really short makeup all
here this is a maybelline color show
nail polish that's what this is this is
a maybelline color show nail polish in
the color lavishly lilac i bought this
off of amazon because it was just so
pretty it has this like iridescent stew
it it's purple but it kind of is Goldie
green and has bigger flecks of shimmer
and it's very glittery I'm excited to
wear this it just looks like a fun nail
polish to wear in a crappy one to take
off this was limited edition I got it
off of amazon so if you wanted I would
definitely check those types of sites
for it but looks really pretty and just
like a fun nail polish to wear on your
nails that is it guys that's everything
I've been trying to be really really
good so a lot of this well only two of
the things I've been trying really hard
not to buy makeup while I've been here
just because we've had a lot of senses
with moving and plus I don't need it I'm
trying to do my project pans and I'm
gonna have a makeup inventory and all
that type of stuff so I'm trying to keep
my self contained with the makeup like
I'm trying to save up as a student and I
get a different discounts places so I'm
trying to just save up some money yeah
we'll see how long that lasts but
fingers crossed from you guys please
