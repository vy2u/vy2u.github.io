Lauren thank you so much for watching if
you want to see it get ready with me on
this look I will leave it link down
below also real quick if you hear a lot
of noises it's because there's
construction going on around me and I
can't help it so yeah I'm sorry all that
being said this is going to be my
reverse video - my things I'm not
surprised on sale at Sephora these are
all the things I guess I am surprised
you're on sale at Sephora I had
mentioned in that video that if you guys
wanted to see the opposite of that video
I would do it and so many of you guys
wanted to see it so that is what this is
but I would be lying if I said that
honestly I'm not that surprised that
much is on like I'm I'm not surprised a
lot of the stuff on the sale section to
me it's not surprising so it was a
little bit harder to come up with this
list I had to kind of widen why I'm
surprised these are on sale so it could
be because it was something that I was
interested in before it went on sale so
I'm like oh my gosh I'm so happy or
excited it is on sale and it could be
something that you guys might want to
pick up or that at least I was
interested in and it could be because it
came on sale so fast for me when it was
released I think those are mostly the
main two things just you know in general
oh my gosh I can't believe that's there
oh my gosh I'm so excited that's there I
think that's a great deal so let's get
into it these items are obviously on
sale when I film this video so they
might or might not be I will leave them
link down below though the first item on
my list is the Becca light chaser
highlights these originally retailed for
$34 and now they're on sale 417 these
come in six colors but at the time I was
looking there were only five in stock
and honestly these are something when
they first released I was really
interested in these had come out I feel
like right when holographic highlighters
were really like in the biggest bloom of
the trend I guess you could say so I was
really excited to try these out they had
some really interesting combinations
some of them like shifted a little bit
green some of them shifted just like
interesting colors but personally I just
thought for $34 that's a pretty
expensive price so then going down to 17
I think is really awesome and exciting I
did actually pick one up this came in a
set with the lip gloss on the Sephora
sale site and if I think it was like
nineteen dollars for this and the lip
gloss in the same like collection that
came out so this one
here is the light chaser highlighter in
the shade champagne dream flashes
Bellini so I'm wearing it today on my
cheeks it's really really pretty I think
that for seventeen dollars it's a pretty
good price I wish it was just that much
anyway cuz these are a bit smaller than
their normal highlighters too but I that
was something really surprising and
awesome that you could get something
that I thought was interesting or cool
on a good deal the next item on the list
is the Urban Decay heavy metals palette
now this is something that I'm not
surprises on sale I don't know I'm
surprised and I'm not I think this one
is sale just so fast from when it first
released and that's where the surprises
for me I was like I mean seriously was
it like a month or so before it went on
discount I just think like at least hold
off a little bit because people that
just bought it I think that's just like
insulting to them that they bought it
and then you know only a little bit
later it went on sale but there are also
reasons I'm not surprised this is on
sale one I just think like a lot of
Urban Decay's holiday pallets throughout
the years like the vice palettes usually
go on sale after the holidays but this
one on sale like quite a bit I feel like
before Christmas so it was originally a
$55 and now it's retailing for 39 on
this for sale section so if it was
something you wanted to pick up you know
you could for a good deal to me the
packaging like I know a lot of people
like the packaging I like hated that
packaging I don't like things that come
out like just like a palette like that I
personally like the protective flap that
like a normal palette gives so I just
don't like it just being like it's loose
thing kind of like the Kat Von D me vida
loca it's not my favorite packaging and
then I don't like that they're like
separated and then there's like a mirror
in between it's just like really
freaking weird to me
so packaging wise it's not my favorite
like I like that it's like cool and
different but I don't think it's
practical for actual use and so I think
it would stop me from actually using the
product but I was more surprised that it
was on sale so early next carbon decay
another one from Urban Decay this is the
troublemaker palette and this comes with
a mascara as well this looks very
similar to the pulp fiction palette that
came out like it's in a very similar
palette style I don't know when I saw it
that's the first thing I thought of to
me this palette
just I don't know it retails originally
for 39 it's on sale for 24 it's fine
it's just like I feel like almost like a
half-assed release in their way I think
they did it to like go with their
mascara or whatever I don't even know I
feel like I'm her don't talk about this
I'm surprised it's on sale again so
early but then at the same time I'm not
like I don't what is this like what I
don't know I'm not even gonna talk about
that too long I know this is supposed to
be things I'm surprised
does she just it was more about the
length of time that it took to go on
sale next I wanted to talk about Chloe
Morello as a beauty haul now this is a
palette that she did with ciate London
and she did an original one which was
like play wishful I don't know she did
an original palette with them and it got
a lot of hype and people really love
that palette and then she did a second
path with them and this one I feel like
I've heard no one talked about I just
saw that girl shake so do a tutorial
with it so that was like the first time
I think I've ever seen it used in action
so I don't know why this one no one
wanted to like get on the bandwagon I
thought this palette was really pretty
it had some really pretty like orangie
reddish warm colors it had some greens
in it like I thought it looked really
pretty and it also reminded me of the
lorac palette so I don't know maybe I
was like thinking it'd be a similar
formula I don't know I was just I was
into it so to see this go on sale I was
like oh nice you can get it an even
better deal this comes with more than
just the palette it has a mascara and it
has a lip gloss and it also has an eye
liner in it so I think that's part of
like the beauty haul aspect of the name
it originally retailed for $49 and now
it's at 37 so you can get it at a better
deal you get a lot of stuff in it so
that was what I was surprised and I
think would be a good value especially
on the sale price to try all that stuff
although I hate the mascara that's in
there so be warned it's gonna flake all
over your eyes alright next let's talk
about the Kat Von D everlasting lip
liner collection this is one of those
vault style products where they're
giving you every single color of the
line and I just find that usually they
create these in such a small quantity
that they sell out really fast I don't
know I feel like I
ever see vaults on sale pages or really
in stock for long like they'll release
them and then people go crazy and buy
them and then they're gone
but this one is on the sale page so the
original price of the lipliners in the
vault set were $200 but now it's only
140 I know I say only 140 it's still a
ton of money but I mean that's quite a
deep discount $60 off if you know me you
know not like someone who really
suggests getting vault products I was
just surprised that this hadn't sold out
that this wasn't something that people
that love cap on G had bought or maybe
they just did too many I mean I know
I've all the products probably lip
liners are the ones that are the least
popular but still I was really surprised
that this was on sale at such a deep
discount next this one really surprised
me the Kat Von D quads she has four
different colors but only three of them
are on sale they're on sale for $15 they
originally retailed for 22 and I thought
this was super surprising I don't know
if she's just continuing these products
but I've always had my eye on the rest
stack there was also this really pretty
like green one I don't know what it was
called but that one was so pretty I
don't think that one was on the website
though but I I don't know I always
wanted one of these they're all matte
quads which i think is so interesting
and different four quads and I think
they're so practical I loved the like
the shape of the packaging like
everything about these seems so great so
$15 I think is a pretty good price if
you wanted to try them out although I
hope she's not discontinuing them but I
think palates kind of run the game you
know what I mean I don't think I don't
see that many people buying quads unless
it's like Tom Ford quads next I wanted
to talk about the bareMinerals newts for
days said this was something I had on a
wish list of mine I'll leave that video
link down below but I talked about how I
wanted to pick it up it had three lip
glosses from bareMinerals and then it
had three of their liquid lipsticks
which were what I was excited to try
they come in mini form and it originally
retailed for $24 which i think is an
amazing price and now it's half off at
$12 you seriously can just not beat that
price by lip products in the mini form I
think is so smart because you know we
want to try different formulas and
different colors and all of that and so
you can buy them tiny get the use out of
but they don't go to waste you can
hopefully use them up maybe or try out
other things they're not taking up as
much space you're not spending as much
money on them like they just have so
many benefits to me and then to get them
at a discounted price even more than
they already are in the set I think is
amazing so I did pick this one out I
suggest you guys picking it up I think
the colors in the set are also amazing
because they're all nudes and things
that people are actually gonna wear so I
think that was so surprising I mean it's
not surprising because it's bare
minerals and like I don't know why no
one likes bare minerals but um yeah I
think that that set is awesome and I was
surprised that it was on sale like and
happy that you could get an even better
deal on such you know a great set I only
have one more thing to talk about and
this is from milk makeup it's a kit and
I think it's all about a blur sect all
about the blur set I don't know it's all
about blurring products although I am
disappointed that this does not include
their blurring primer stick like even in
many of it I'm like that would have
probably been a good idea to put in this
blurring set anyway it retails
originally for $48 and now it's on sale
for 28 so if you wanted to try some milk
makeup items I think this would be a
great way to do that it has a dry
shampoo in it a lip color a face mist a
mascara and one of the little
highlighters so oh and one makeup
remover wipe don't want to forget that
such a great value but I think that if
you were interested in milk makeup and
some of those products were on your to
try list then I think that this is a
great value at $28 to try all those
different things you can kind of get an
idea if milk makeup is a brand that you
want to continue trying from or if it's
not your style
I love value sets if you can't tell so
if you can get those already discounted
products on sale you can save a lot of
money and try some fun makeup out so I
hope you guys enjoyed the products that
I was surprised were on the sale site on
Sephora I might be doing this with like
an Ulta or I don't know I might bring
this back when there are a lot of things
on sale but I hope you enjoyed let me
know if any of these things are
interesting to you what your surprise is
on the sale section and I will see you
in my next video guys thanks so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
