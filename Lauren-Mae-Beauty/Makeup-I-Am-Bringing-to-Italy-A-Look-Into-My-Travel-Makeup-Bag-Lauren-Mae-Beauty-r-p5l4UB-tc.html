Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to share with you guys
the makeup I'm gonna be bringing to
Italy with me a lot of you guys
requested that I show you what I'm
bringing when it comes to makeup items
in the video I did about like beauty
travel essentials which is more like
skincare haircare that type of stuff so
I'll leave that video link down below so
this video kicks off my pre-recorded
videos I leave for Italy on the 31st on
Thursday I'm excited and I will be gone
until like the 22nd like I'm gone a long
time so I have a video at least every
other day I should have though about
like 17 videos up while I'm gone those
were all pre-recorded and pre-scheduled
and I'm really excited to have that
content up for you guys so I hope you
guys enjoy it and if you didn't know I'm
going to Italy so definitely follow me
on Instagram I'm gonna be posting
pictures there obviously but I also am
going to start Instagram stories which
I've never done yet so I want to be able
to have a way that you guys can kind of
be with me in real time instead of
having just pre uploaded stuff I'm not
used to having this much but I'm so glad
that I am able to have that content I've
been working my little booty off to get
it all worked out and like uploaded and
everything so anyway let's get into the
makeup I'm bringing because I'm gonna be
gone so long and because I love makeup
and because I want cute pictures but I
also don't want to like have a million
things it's been a struggle it's been
really hard to be minimalistic as well
as realistic with the type of makeup I'm
gonna be wearing on the day-to-day so I
think I've pared it down I think I have
it under control for me at least my goal
was to fit everything in this love bag
this is a pretty big makeup bag I got it
at Ross because I love Roth it's from
Kenneth Cole reaction so I just wanted
to make sure that all my makeup fit into
this one bag and so yeah let me get into
what I'm bringing I'm gonna do it in the
order I would do my face and I'm gonna
tell you why I'm bringing what I'm
bringing and then I think I'm gonna do a
follow-up video to this one that's going
to be about makeup I actually used while
I was on vacation I think I might have
done that before but I definitely had
this idea for a while where you know I'm
gonna let you know no I didn't use that
yes I did and you know how it worked out
and everything so let's just get into it
because it's already long intro
sorry good so I'm technically bringing
three primers and I
no that sounds excessive and it kind of
is but these are all small sizes and I
have different reasons for each I'm
worried about my combo oily skin when
I'm in Italy because it's gonna be more
humid I don't know how my skin is gonna
react to that I don't know what's gonna
happen and how that's going to affect my
makeup wear so that is part of the
reason that I'm bringing a couple
different things up my sleeve so the
first one I'm bringing is the Beca first
light priming filter I used up my even
smaller size of this so I'm moving on to
the half ounce I really like this
product it's gonna give me a glow it's
lightweight it's perfect for like really
simple makeup days but this does tend to
get a little bit glowy on me throughout
the day so that is why I also brought a
mattifying primer
this one's from Too Faced and it's the
primed and PG cooling matte skin
perfecting primer this gives me moisture
while still just given me more madness
to my skin so I wanted to bring that and
then this little guy here is from makeup
forever it is the step one skin
equalizer in the smoothing primer and
this is just if I really want to like
fill in the pores on the you know front
by my nose and on my nose I a pretty
textured skin in that area and if I
really want my makeup to look good for
going out or I'm taking pictures or
something like that I just want to have
that as an option so I decided to bust
out the one from my kit that's like a
mini one so I can take up less space in
my bag so those are the primers that I'm
gonna be bringing what we'll do is I'll
put it in here as we go and we'll see if
it all fits fingers crossed next is
foundation and that's a little excessive
too because again I'm just not sure how
my skin's gonna react so the first one
I'm bringing and the one that I think
I'm gonna use the most is the covergirl
and Olay simply ageless foundation I
love this thing I'm so happy that I
picked it back up because it is just so
simple to use so this is what it looks
like and I just put my sponge in here I
tapped like I'll put my sponge in like
Dunton done and then that usually can
cover basically half of my face I'll go
in and like cover a few areas where I
have more redness or I needed a little
bit more coverage and then I do the same
thing on the other side of my face and
literally my foundations on in like a
minute so I really love this product it
gives nice coverage it just looks like
skin it's really pretty but this does
tend to just you know again my
kind of come through throughout the day
and I just don't know how it's gonna
hold up so I brought that I also brought
the BB Creams I've been loving from AOA
studio these are like a dollar each so I
wanted to bring those because I have
been using them a lot again these do
break down and like show my oils
throughout the day but again I kind of
like that look like I don't mind that
I've said this before but I'd rather
just like move my fingers around and
kind of like stop up some of that oil
and my makeup looks fresh and ready to
go then have some things so matte and
full coverage that once it starts
breaking down you're just like done for
and then the last foundation I'm
bringing is from Sonia Kashuk I don't
believe they sell this anymore but it's
the soft focus satin matte and this one
is the most mattifying out of the three
I just want to have an option in case I
need something more matte because my
oils are out of control the humidity is
going crazy just in case just in case
because these are gonna be long wear
days because we're gonna be out and
about doing stuff you know exploring
having the time of our freakin lives for
concealers and correctors I'm bringing
the Becca under-eye corrector in the
light/medium shade I love this thing so
much it's gonna be great for when you
know we didn't get as much sleep because
we were having too much wine and pizza
and partying with the Romans so yeah
that's a must
and then I have two concealers and the
reason I'm bringing two is because I
love both of these but they're both kind
of like half way used up slash more than
half way used up so I just want to be on
the safe side knowing that I have a
backup of one or the other that will
last me throughout the trip so I'm
bringing the Maybelline fit me and fair
and I'm bringing my Milani a race and
retouch or retouch and a race and these
are both some of my favorites from the
drugstore for powders I'm just bringing
one guys I know I decided to bring the
Too Faced peach perfect powder I like
this I like that it has the kind of like
powder sifter thing here so there's not
gonna be a ton of powder in the catch I
don't know what that is but you know
it's not gonna get everywhere I like
that this is also a bit more mattifying
but still looks really nice and thin on
my skin it doesn't like give me too much
coverage or give me too much cakiness or
anything so I think this one will be
really nice this does taste like peach
which is something I actually don't like
about it like it just makes me think
every time I put it on like I'm
ingesting so much powder I'm eating so
much powder and makeup every
but anyway I'm gonna bring that powder
and it's the only one I also kept it
pretty minimal when it came to bronzer
and blush I'm bringing the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer and this is in
the shade bronzer which usually I'm in
the light bronzer but this is the one
that came in the kit that I recently got
from Ulta so I'm bringing that and it is
a bit darker but it's a bit cool toned
as well compared to the light bronzer
and since I'm probably gonna get a tan I
think this will work really well I'm not
someone who really needs to like contour
so I don't need anything like that with
me and for blush again keeping it simple
this is super small which also is great
for travel this is the tarte blush in
part a i'm trying to hit pan it's just a
win in so many ways for me to bring this
so i'm excited to bring this and i'm
hoping to hit pan if i do i'll show you
on the instagram stories the day i do
highlighter is kind of the hardest one i
want to bring all three of these but i'm
gonna try to be good and bring it down
to two but we'll see I'm for sure
bringing the essence pure nude
highlighter this one's really nice for a
subtle like highlighted look and so I
want to bring that and then I really
want to bring the Oprah highlighter
because this is actually a little
palette it comes with three of them I
have a nice golden wine if I want to be
golden I have a nice cool toned pink and
then this one here which is blissful is
a little bit too dark for me but I want
to bring this but I also really love
color pops flexitarian so I want to
bring that as well it's what I'm wearing
on my cheeks today and I will have a
whole video reviewing these so I don't
want to talk about them too much so I
don't know we'll see what I bring I kind
of want to bring both though and then to
wrap up the face I'm also bringing some
blotting powder these are from Dino
Platts or I'm not sure what the brand is
Oh too cool for school I got these
office' for awhile ago and it has like
the little pad where it comes out
naturally and then I'm gonna be bringing
some elf ones and try to fit them in
here and kind of refill this with them
but this is a must I think because my
oils do come through this will just be a
great way to refresh throughout the day
we're moving on to eyes so that's great
that's not too bad right for eye shadow
really the only thing I'm gonna be
bringing is the modern Renaissance this
is like a perfect palette for me it has
a matte cream up here I'm probably going
to repress mine actually before I leave
so that I can easily use it these are
great transition shades
for me I have some like deeper tones if
I want to cool tones if I want to
something to deepen it up I also have
fun pops of pink and orange and things
like that so this is just a great
palette and I know that as much as I
love I shadow we're gonna be moving fast
we're in a big group I'm not going to be
spending hours doing my eyeshadow but if
for some reason I have the time and want
to create something more intricate and
fun I can also do that with this palette
so yeah this is perfect for me
I am bringing two singles though and
these are my fun pops of color so I'm
bringing the shade deja boo' from color
pop and that is probably more for like
the inner corner or the lower lashline
or even the lid I just wanted to have
them just in case again you guys know I
love fun colors and then this is the hot
pink shade I don't know it off the top
of my head so I will leave it in the
description box but again it's from
colour-pop and I just have them in their
little single shadow things which are
actually coming in handy for this trip
because they're so small and compact I
am bringing a glitter primer and I'm
gonna bring an eye primer I don't think
I brought that out here but I'm gonna
bring my ELF eye primer and then the
glitter primer is in case I want to do a
more intense look just in case it's so
tiny it's worth it to bring to me I
probably shouldn't bring this money I
probably should whittle it down to at
least two if not one but I am gonna
bring some liquid shadows again I just
might want to just mean just a little a
little glitter a little something fun so
I'm gonna bring those and part of the
trip me and Sam are gonna be alone so
the first half we're going with family
and we will be all together doing fun
activities and then the second part
we're gonna be in Venice and in Florence
together me and just Sam so I'll have
more time to get ready those days and
you know we can kind of have more time
on our own so there will be time then
that's what I'm thinking anyway I'm also
bringing a glitter liner from Urban
Decay this is the pyro shade and I love
this for like the lower lashline and
inner corner and stuff I'm wearing a
similar type of situation right now it's
easy to do and something fun and sparkly
I'm bringing three different eyeliners
one is from Clarins and it has three
eyeliners and one lip liner one is
purple one is aqua and one is black so
that's great and then I'm bringing a
white liner and a brown liner this one
is Mac's Costa riche and yeah I love to
have those liners too
my eyes for eyebrows and bringing just
like my tried-and-true products so I'm
bringing the colour-pop brow vos brow
pencil and blonde the elf instant lift
eyebrow pencil in taupe and then I'm
bringing the AOA Studio taupe brow gel
to define the hair so I am excited to
have those that was like not even hard
to decide for mascara I'm gonna be
bringing my Urban Decay perversion and
then I think I'm also going to buy a
waterproof mascara I don't have one
currently but I'm gonna use that for the
trip when we're like by the ocean or
doing more activities like that so I can
still have mascara if I want it and last
we're moving on to lips this seems
excessive but I kind of have these
broken up into nudes and everyday colors
that I wear all the time and then I did
want to bring some fun bright colors for
pictures and just in case I'm feeling
inspired yeah
pictures are a big deal for me on the
show I've mentioned it a lot so we'll go
through the fun ones at first I'm
bringing the NARS pencil in let's go
crazy I'll swatch these for you too
it's a beautiful hot pink and it's in a
matte formula so I know it's going to
look great all day long if I want to
wear it that long I'm also bringing the
shade of buraco and this is another one
of the NARS ones it's a hot red orange
and this is actually limited edition so
you can't get it anymore but it's
beautiful and it's one of my favorite
shades then similar to that but
different
this is zip ndele from bite Beauty this
one is not matte this one's like more
creamy and glossy this is more of like a
hot coral it has more pink in it than
the orange one another oranjee lip but
this is in a different formula it's the
covergirl Queen collection and this is
in D shade Bay and again it's kind of
that coral a color that's really what I
think I'm gonna be wearing obviously and
then I'm also gonna be bringing the
katie-cat gloss in the shade candy cat
which is like a cool toned baby pink and
that's that so I just wanted some fun
colors to play with again for pictures
and outfits and just different things
and then I got my nudes which is what
I'm mostly gonna be wearing so we'll
even see if I wear any of those other
ones I just figured these are so tiny
there's no reason not to just bring them
so I'm gonna be bringing the shade
sugar from bareMinerals in their
lipgloss love this I guess I'll swatch
these two it's on the top they're so
beautiful this is always in my purse I'm
bringing a lip balm this is the Revlon
kiss balm in the peach and it does leave
like a nice peachy glossy tint to the
lips I don't know if you'll see it but
beautiful I am bringing a liquid
lipstick this is the covergirl current
nude and this is my favorite one from
the collection I actually really enjoy
this so that's it there another gloss is
from Fenty this is the gloss balm which
is there and it's just so easy to use
it's so easy plus I kind of want to get
a picture because what they do on
Instagram is like have a picture so I
want to have a cool picture in like
Sorrento with the buildings and that I
think it'd be cool anyway and then this
is the Revlon a kiss plumping lip cream
it's my favorite lip product at the
moment I'm wearing it now I've been
wearing it in a lot of videos I could
not not bring this if I had to only
bring one nude one I'd bring this and
that's a swatch of it there so very
similar all those are very similar but
you know why choose I'm also bringing a
spray this is the Too Faced one so this
is not gonna fit in here though like I
already know that for sure
let's see if we can do this I think I
can and I'll probably keep one of the
glosses out I'll probably keep these two
in my purse so boom we did it that's all
the makeup I'm bringing it all fits in
here and I'm really happy about it I
know it may seem excessive and it
probably is but I'm a makeup lover and
so for me when I go on a trip having
beauty essentials is a part of the trip
like that is a sectioned off part of my
suitcase I account for that and I'd
bring less clothes so that I can bring
more beauty stuff just who I am anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed the video and I
also hope you guys enjoy all the videos
to come I do talk about Italy
in a lot of them so I'm sorry for the
irritates you I will see you guys when I
get back from the trip in live time I'll
probably do some type of get ready with
me to come back and say like I'm bagged
but anyway I hope you enjoy thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
