Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another
makeup I'm not surprises on sale at
Sephora video this is going to be the
Memorial Day edition I wasn't expecting
to film this video so that's gonna be
like an extra one for the week because I
don't know how long these sale items are
gonna be up so I thought if anything was
to let you know what's on sale with the
Memorial Day sale on Sephora site this
is like a series of videos I started
back at the end of last year so I will
leave my two other ones linked down
below and just to start this video off
right I want to say that I think sale
makeup is awesome so if any of this
stuff is something that you like and you
can get it at a better deal I think
that's amazing more than anything this
is just a video that explores the idea
that there are reasons that things go on
sale
I feel like makeup doesn't just go on
sale for no reason there's usually
something that makes it go on sale
whether it's an older item they're
coming out with new stuff it didn't sell
well so that's what I'm talking about in
this video so I hope you guys enjoy
let's just get into the items that I am
not surprised or on the sale page on
Sephora's website alright so the first
item on my list is a Kat Von D liquid
lipstick and I'm not gonna lie at first
I was like oh my gosh
Kat Von D liquid lipsticks are on sale
um and then I clicked on it and there's
only one Kat Von D like ooh lipstick
that's on sale and it's the shade
Jeffrey it's a hot pink so if you guys
don't know there's obviously beef
between them they had like this whole
falling-out about like two years ago and
so yeah not surprised the shade
Jeffrey's on sale I'm kind of surprised
it took this long for it to go on sale I
was laughing kind of hard at this one
because I saw the banner on the website
saying like 60% off and I was like oh I
should see what's on the site see if I
should make one of these videos and that
was the first thing I looked at and was
like yeah it's perfect it's perfect for
this video so um yeah I'm not surprised
that Kat Von D is putting that liquid
lipstick up for sale and trying to get
rid of it since they are no longer
friends
oh and just so you guys know the Kat Von
D liquid lipsticks usually retail for
twenty dollars but the Jeffrey one is on
sale for twelve the next item I'm not
surprises on sale is the Natasha - no no
5 pan palette in Ares this was a holiday
release it retailed originally for 48
dollars but it is currently on sale for
34 the reason I'm not surprised it's on
sale is because
didn't get very good reviews I think
when you look at this palette initially
it's stunning really pretty colors
I remember watching a video that Tati
did where she had it and she like turned
it upside down or you know was using the
palette and two of the shadows had
fallen out I'm not sure if it was from
this specific palette because there were
two that came out but overall the
reviews are saying that they weren't
blendable they weren't as pigmented that
they just weren't the quality that
they're used to for Natasha's Damona and
then the fact that some of the shadows
were coming crumbled or falling out of
the pans it just wasn't an overall
really good release at least with press
so I am not surprised that this is still
sitting on the shelves and they're
trying to get rid of it next on the list
is a tart brush set this is the Tarte
minutes to mermaid brush set it
originally retailed for $42 and now it's
on sale for 29 pacifically this brush
set has like a fish tale ending for the
brushes and I think this is a cute
release it went with their mermaid
collection but I've heard so many people
say they're like over mermaids I'm
personally not over mermaids I'm not
over the unicorn and mermaid trend but I
know that a lot of other people are and
it has been kind of oversaturated as of
late
to me these also just don't seem super
practical when you think about like
storing these brushes the end of them is
so wide and like weirdly shaped doesn't
seem very practical so I'm not surprised
that this didn't like sell off the
shelves although I will say I've heard a
lot of really great reviews of Tarte
brush sets so if for whatever reason
this mermaid set catches your eye it
might be a really good deal for you I
will say there was a ton of Tarte stuff
on the website I'm not gonna talk really
about any more of it but there is so
much Tarte stuff on sale on the website
which really doesn't surprise me either
not only do they come out with a lot of
stuff I feel like that's kind of
mediocre they're constantly on to the
next thing and so they just have a lot
of stuff that like if it doesn't sell
I'm not surprised it's still like kind
of hanging around on top of the fact
that they have been not very well
received at the beginning of the year
with their whole foundation line not
being very inclusive and all of that so
I just feel like the beauty community
turned off of them for a little bit and
so I think that might also have to do
with it but obviously these are just my
speculations to guys like I'm just
giving you what I think base
what I know why this stuff is on sale we
could call this makeup conspiracy
theories alright next on the list is
something that is a part of the weekly
Wow but I do think that the weekly Wow
is a little beefed up this time because
of the fact that Memorial Day is Monday
so again I don't know how long all this
stuff is going to be on sale it might
not be on sale like permanently again it
could just be for this like weekend or
until the next weekly Wow drops which is
on Thursdays anyway this is the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette this is a
classic staple in the beauty community
it originally retailed for $49 and you
can get it on sale for 25 the reason I'm
not surprised this is on sale is because
I feel like we're at a point in the
beauty community where kind of these old
tried-and-true classics are just
becoming just too old-school and brands
are kind of revamping their lines coming
up with their new classics and so it's
just time that the chocolate bar kind of
phases out so it's kind of like this sad
like bittersweet thing like I'm excited
for new because at one point I had the
chocolate bar palette and I have since
decluttered it because to me it's not
that exciting and when you look at the
original chocolate bar palette you can
tell that this came out before like
these warm orange e tones were kind of
the standard and what everyone was doing
when you look at this compared to some
of the like more warm toned palettes
like the modern renaissance or the
violet Voss holy grail palette this
looks almost cool toned and I just feel
like it had its place but really no one
talks about it and if they do it's like
because it was like an old favorite and
I think that there's like this nostalgia
for products in the beauty community
where people don't use them but they
still act like they love them and they
really probably think that they love
them but when you like actually do the
math you're like oh wow haven't use that
palette in a year and a half like it
can't still be a love at that point you
don't use it anyway that's a whole
nother topic but yeah I'm not really
surprised it's on sale and I think that
this will kind of start phasing out very
soon next is another weekly Wow these
are the Anastacio blush trios and I'm
not that surprised that these are on
sale I think these are beautiful there
are five different trios that you could
pick from I did hear kind of good
reviews when they came out but I feel
like it just kind of like came and went
and then was off the radar I think maybe
one of the reasons for that is because
the
our trio so you're buying three blushes
not just the one you want these retail
originally for $30 and now they're on
sale for 21 and for me at least when I
look at these blessed trios I think
they're beautiful I think they'd be
great for an artist kit but when I'm
looking at them for my individual use
there's not one that I feel like I could
use all three of the shades I feel like
there's always this like really bright
pop of color which makes the individual
pilots interesting but not necessarily
usable for every single person and when
I'm buying a trio for personal use I
want to make sure that all the colors
are something that I could potentially
use and love these also seem super
pigmented which makes me kind of scared
to use the more bright shades in the
palette but let us know if you've tried
these out if you really like the formula
what it's like in case anyone was like
looking for reviews or wanted to try it
out because I think $21 is a pretty good
deal to get three different blushes
especially from such a nice brand like
Anastacio I just think color wise a lot
of people are into nudes a lot of people
are into peaches a lot of people want a
more subdued easy blush and I didn't
feel like any of the trios really hit
that market really well they just kind
of hit like a spectrum which is great
but not necessarily what people want it
at least that's what I think so moving
up next we have a couple items from Kat
Von D so the Kat Von D metal crush
highlighting palette it originally
retailed for $36 and now is 2150 I'm not
surprised this is on sale because I know
that this is a very glittery palette
some people love a glittery highlight
and I think that's amazing I don't think
there's anything wrong with that but I
would say overall that's not most
people's preference and so I'm not
surprised that people wouldn't pick this
up I also think this came out a little
bit late like I know people still love
highlighters I still love highlighters
especially when like a really great one
comes out but I think like the overall
like high point of the craze of
highlighters is kind of a little bit
dying down and so because this wasn't a
super wearable highlight and also
because these were a little bit more
colorful I don't think that it's sold as
well so yeah I think that's why I don't
say and the last item from Kat Von D on
my list is the I am divine palette and
the reason I think this one on sale is
just because it's not wearable for a lot
of people now I know that there are
people who want colorful palates I know
that there's totally a market for that
but I think that it kind of reached that
audience and then stopped
I love colorful palates I didn't pick
this palette up because as much as I
think it's beautiful when you look at it
and I can get some inspiration from this
palette I have these colors in my
collection and I just found that like
there are two blues and like a green and
the rest are pretty neutral like black
white grey type of things that I already
have and that I didn't want to rebuy in
this palette it's something else that I
think might be the reason that this is
on sale and why I'm not surprised is
because although there is this community
of people who want colorful palettes I
would say that overall the majority of
people don't wear color like that is
that's the situation that is my brands
put out neutral palettes I know in my
new beauty launches I'm always like gosh
another neutral palette another neutral
palette and you know I know it can get
repetitive and I can get so tired of it
but like the more I look at it the more
I'm like yeah they keep doing it because
that's what's making them money they're
putting out palettes that make them
money if people didn't buy neutral
palettes and there really was a demand
for more colorful palettes I feel like
brands would do it because they're gonna
follow the money and I don't think
there's as much money in colorful
palettes as there are in neutral
palettes and it makes me sad because I
want companies to come out with more
creative ideas and not just be indie
brands like I want mainstream brands to
have these awesome color stories but I
think when you really look at the
numbers a majority of people wear
neutral colors so that's what they're
catering to alright moving on next on
the list is Deborah Lippmann almost I
think everything from Deborah Lippmann
is on sale on the website and the reason
I'm not surprised on this isn't because
Deborah Lippmann is in great quality I
mean I don't think that any of this
stuff is necessarily bad quality in any
way again so if you want this stuff and
this is something that was on your list
you can get it at an amazing deal but
there was this time on YouTube when I
remember Deborah Lippmann being very
popular it was something that was so
luxury to me I remember mermaid dreams
is that what it was it was a nail polish
it was like a teal glittery nail polish
that was super popular I remember that
being talked about all the time is like
this beautiful standard you know summer
nail polish and
it was so raved about that to me deborah
lippmann was a very coveted brand it
became something that I got every single
time that we would go on vacation I
would pick up when deborah lippmann
polish that's kind of my like souvenir
so I could remember that place and have
this like expensive exciting trinket you
know but now the beauty community has
changed so much since then that was back
when like missglamorazzi or Ingrid was
like who I watched as a beauty youtuber
and I really do think there's been a big
shift with Beauty youtubers being
strictly makeup and not even skincare
not nail care not like other Beauty
favorites not like anything besides like
makeup and new releases and so I never I
I don't think I ever hear anyone talking
about nail polish really unless they're
like a nail polish channel yeah and not
that many people talk about nail polish
I think maybe to the trend of like
having your nails done at a salon and
stuff is a bigger thing now than it was
so that could also play into it but yeah
I'm kind of not surprised because I
really don't hear many people talk about
it but I think deborah lippmann is
really nice
so her polishes normally retail for 20
and then the whole line right now is on
sale for 14
there are also sets that are on sale
there are also her like nail and hand
care items so I love the rich girl hand
cream it's really nice and has SPF so
yeah I'm not surprised because I never
hear it talked about but I do think
they're good items let's move on from
that as well
all right next on my list I don't think
I've talked about this in my last one so
we're gonna talk about it now and this
is the urban decay disco Queen
holographic collection this was just a
very small kind of random collection
that came out it had two items in it
both were highlighters one was a stick
it retailed for $26 and is now on sale
for 13 both of these items are kind of
this like purple blue holographic or duo
chromatic highlighter and I have a lot
of friends on here who got that as PR
and basically all of them were like it's
pretty in the packaging and it's watch
is really pretty but it's just like not
wearable and a lot of them mentioned
that it's too purple like it's not even
like oh a purpley blue highlighter it
just is like a purpley blue basically
eye shadow and it's just too dark for
the cheeks so
I'm not surprised based off of their
reviews they're just so random and I
feel like urban decay has been doing
that a lot lately
I think I've heard from a lot of people
throughout comments and different things
that they're just gonna wait for urban
decay stuff to go half off before they
buy it because they know that
collections never sellout and that they
can always get it on a discount
afterward kind of like the Kristen LAN
collection so yeah I'm not surprised
this is on sale and this is the time to
buy it if it was something you were
looking for the other highlighter is a
powder again it's the same color you
could layer these on top of each other
if you wanted to that retails for $29.99
on my list that I am NOT surprises on
sale it's the Too Faced boudoir food war
but Dewar I can't even say it now I've
said it so many times the Too Faced
boudoir that sounds so wrong anyway the
door oh my gosh it came whatever eyes
palette this retails for $36 and now is
on sale for $18 the reason I'm not
surprised is on sales one this is a
classic item in two-faced collection if
they're gonna start phasing out the
chocolate bar palette they're definitely
gonna start painting this one out it's
cool toned which I know a lot of people
at least in the community that I watch
are wanting cool tone palettes but this
one's just like a pretty old one like
you've had it at some point probably
into cluttered and also they are phasing
out these tin pallets and kind of moving
on with their natural love collection I
think it was or whatever the natural
makeup collection that they recently
came out with with repackaged stuff you
can tell they're moving to a different
packaging system now and so I'm not
surprised this is on sale I'm not sure
if they are repackaging this palette or
if they are completely gonna get rid of
it but I wouldn't be surprised if this
leaves the shelves permanently it's just
an old one you know what I mean it's
like classic two-faced but I think as we
all know like the beauty community right
now is all about the new next thing not
about old classics so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed the video let me know what
you are not surprises on sale in the
comments down below also if any of these
things are something that you're like
hell yeah I'm excited to pick up let us
know that as well
and that is everything thank you guys so
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
