Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk about products
that I want to get or tempting me
despite everything I know
despite the reviews despite the brand
despite the fact that they might not be
products I normally use I might have a
million of these products already in my
collection but despite all of that I
still AM tempted I still want these
products most of these in the end I'm
probably not gonna buy but there's just
something about them that just like has
me like there's just like this tiny
little piece of me that's like maybe
well well do I need that alright so
let's just get into them the first item
is something I want because it's on sale
and I know this is a product that if it
weren't on sale I would not want this at
all like I would not pay full price for
this but because it's on sale I'm like
well maybe some of the colors and this
is the urban decay distortion eyeshadow
palette this is on sale at Sephora and
I'm sure other places from originally 48
down to $24 and that's really the
temptation I'm like $25 for those shades
I'm sure they're pigmented and fun it
has the top row of like some transformer
shades which I am just like I'm just I
have a weakness for duochrome
obviously my eye lifts today this is
using the new one mild like goth
collection Gotha graphic which I'm gonna
be doing a full comprehensive like first
impression and then like a second look
and then a final look like after I've
tested it so that video will be coming
and this look will be in that and
everything Jessi you guys know but
anyway when it comes to this palette I
know that I don't need it but there's
something about it that's just tempting
like oh well maybe like for that price
it's it's okay the next two products are
highlighters from Too Faced the first
one is the diamond light highlighter
this again with the duo chrome and the
different colors and all of that in the
packaging everything about it it just
looks so so pretty I watched the makeup
break up if you guys don't follow them
I'm gonna leave their channel link down
below
I saw them break this product up and I
watched it just to see swatches and like
watch the destruction of something so
beautiful and I really want this product
so bad but there's like a green in it
that's
kind of holding me back I don't really
want a green highlighter I feel like I
probably could get a similar look with
like the other duochrome highlighters I
already have but there's just something
about this one highlighter it's just so
expensive why is it so much money I feel
like the moonchild palette is only eight
dollars more for six shades so but it's
so pretty like I want it so bad the
other highlighters from them I also want
these did not get very good reviews
they're in the heart compact and they're
pressed like a diamond do they look
really pretty I guess the other ones
breasts like a tiny tube but these are
also pressed like diamonds but heart
diamonds instead of a you know rectangle
diamond these retail for $30 and I think
that they look so pretty I know a lot of
people didn't like them because they're
subtle but I personally love a subtle
highlight like I don't need something
metallic I like something that just
gives a nice soft luminosity to the skin
so there's something that based off the
reviews even though they got bad reviews
I still kind of want them another
freaking highlighter on this list this
one is from hourglass and this is the
ambient metallic stroke palette okay
there's a couple of things that are
holding me back from this one I don't
need a million highlighters and that's
part of the reason this is just tempting
I know I have these colors I know I have
these products in my collection but this
palette I feel like got so many amazing
reviews like everyone loved it I've seen
the swatches I've seen it on people's
skin it looks so pretty and so I want it
but then it's $62 and I'm like well
that's way too much money I just can't
bring myself to do it if it was like 45
maybe 50 I could do but the 62 is just
it always stops me it always stops me
when I'm like yeah no I can't do it but
there's something about it that I said I
want it I can't believe it's still there
I thought it was gonna be like limited
edition holiday but it's still on
Sephora so I don't know I don't know if
I can do it next is a product from Tarte
and this is the Tarte Park Avenue
princess palette this retails for $46
and it's a contouring like highlighting
palette this is something I've wanted
for a long time since it released I just
thought this would be great for my kit I
thought that it would be nice for me I
loved all the different shades in it and
the reason that this is like tempting
and I'm probably not gonna pick it up
one I'm really trying not to support too
much Tarte stuff like I know they're not
the only brand who has excluded people
because of their shade range but just
with that and then just different things
and their past and just so much I'm just
like I don't know I don't really want to
put my money in that brand and continue
to support them I'm not like on a
full-on boycott but I just and being
more conscious of my money and it's not
something I need in my collection my
desire for it isn't that much it's just
kind of tempting so I'm like I'm sure
there are other things even that paladin
alone wouldn't work for everyone it only
works for her like medium to light skin
tone so I don't know I just don't really
I don't feel comfortable there's
something like nabbing me and that's why
it's a temptation but in my heart I know
I probably shouldn't buy it next are
products that I want to buy and I'm
tempted to buy because I already have
one that I love and these are the Becca
Lite chaser highlighters these are on
sale for 17 dollars and I love the one I
have in Bellini flashes champagne dream
or whatever it is it's such a beautiful
highlighter and if you're someone who
wants to do duochrome but doesn't want
something too crazy I think that that
one is so pretty it has a flash but it's
nothing too much it's just subtle enough
it's so perfect
so because of that I want to pick up the
other ones but I know I don't need them
and I find that a lot of the times when
I want to pick up more from a collection
I end up liking the one I have the most
and then the other ones don't get used I
just have such a fervor and excitement
for that product that I want to like
support and buy all of them but I don't
need them so that one they're tempting
me but I'm gonna try to keep it under
control
seriously it's all about the
highlighters everything on this list is
highlighters I feel like those are just
tempting I don't know why they're just
so pretty in the packaging oh why next
is something from Kylie Jenner which
already Kylie Jenner is a brand that I
just haven't never bought from it's
never really spoken to me I was never
tempted to wait up late in the morning
or be on the website at the right time
just like throw money at her but the
highlighters and even the blushes they
look so pretty
and again these didn't get super great
reviews I don't hear anyone talking
about them at all like at all
but they're 22 dollars which is pretty
reasonably priced when you look at the
other two-faced highlighters and the
hourglass hi
want to get and they look really pretty
and again they're more subtle which is
something I like so there's something I
kind of want to try and just you know
see if the hypes real see what it's
about I've never tried that brand before
and maybe it's something really awesome
I also have something from Jeffrey star
on here again not a brand that I
necessarily am super supportive of but
the lip scrubs they just I love lip
stuff I love lip balms I love lip
treatments and like lip scrubs just
anything having to do with like taking
care of your lips and so his lip scripts
they just he has like a million flavors
like he's really invested in the flavor
selection of his lip scrubs you have
literally anything you could ever ask
for so there are 12 dollars and I think
that's a pretty good price I know that's
still crazy expensive for like some
sugar probably with oil but I mean they
easily could be priced at $20 so you
know I probably again won't buy those
things but they still tempt me like
they're just these things that like are
higher up on a list than some other
things out there in the makeup world and
the last product are the products that
kind of sparked this whole entire list
and they are be morphe day Slayer and
night master palettes they retail for
$15 apiece and I don't need these I
don't need these you got here these are
just neutral palettes one is warm toned
one is slightly less warm tone with
maybe some purples but still pretty warm
like there's no reason I need these but
I love the price point I just want them
I want them so bad so those are the ones
that I probably could see myself buying
like the most out of everything on this
list but they're just so tempting like I
don't know what it is about it I know
it's going against all my better
judgment everything I know all the
shadows I already have in my collection
and but there's something about those
palettes why seriously do not ask me I
don't know I feel like they'd be good in
my kit I feel like they'd be good for me
I just I want them so anyway leave some
of your makeup temptations down below
things that you probably know in your
heart of hearts that you'll never buy
but for whatever reason has like a hold
on you you always want to watch a review
or a video using those products you want
to see swatches you want to see people
wearing them
love to know what kind of has captured
your heart and attention and other than
that I will see you guys in my next
video thank you so so much for watching
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
