Lawrence thank you so much for watching
I was inspired by my own make a basket
series to do this video but this is not
a project pan necessarily but I just
wanted to pull up some things out of my
collection that I really actually want
to try to get finished by the end of the
year I do have a year-long project going
on I also have my finished 13 by
Halloween going on but these are items
that whether or not I put them in a
project later on in the year I do want
to finish these up or they probably
should go there things that don't get
love in my collection regularly or I
feel like I could actually use them up
and it's just kind of a win I believe
it's 10 different products so it's not
too long of a list I don't feel like
it's totally crazy to try to enter these
guys up so let's just get into the first
is a primer this is the to shake lot
blur perfecting primer from YSL I did
get this from Influenster a long time
ago and I've used up quite a bit of it
so I just want to finish it up I do
think this is a nice product it just
nice and silky so I do think if I try to
use this I could use it up I don't want
to get rid of this settles the packaging
and I don't mind the product so I think
it'd be nice just to kind of move it out
this is something that's almost done
it's just a gimme product but like my
goodness this is a finish by the end of
the year I don't know what's happening
to my life this is the locket setting
powder and translation from Kat Von D
there's like nothing left so I do want
to finish that up I have a love-hate
relationship with that powder sometimes
they like it sometimes I don't like it
at all so that's why I kind of just have
been staying away from it so I need to
just like get down to brass tacks and
finish up the last little bit another
powder that I have in terms Sephora this
is the micro smooth powder in the color
light this is the lightest shade at the
time I purchased this but it now comes
in a fair and so this is a little bit
dark for me in summer it works but I do
want to just finish it up it's a baked
product so it was don't and I have worn
down the dome quite a bit so hopefully I
can work on that I do have some powders
in my 13 by Halloween now so this will
probably take a backseat but hopefully
by the end of the year I can get it out
of here obviously if you didn't notice
the lid is like coming off and it's like
totally busted so it just it's time for
it to go for foundations I really only
have one thing this is the jouer matte
moisture tint sunscreen
at generation Beauty when I went a while
ago I mean I was still in school when I
wanted so this is just getting old have
some screening so I know that's going to
expire soon I don't think it has yet but
I can't see an expiration date
specifically on it oh yeah I do
4:18 so I felt a little bit of time on
it actually but I just want to get it
gone it's not something I reach for and
I remember really loving it when I did
use it so maybe I'll just like fall back
in love with it but I don't want it in
my collection at the moment I did decide
to put one concealer in here this is
from Eden minerals and this is the color
oh it's like off I don't know the color
of this I'll have it listed down below
like I always do this is just like a
click of pen very close to the tuna claw
and things like that
the reason I put this in here is because
I think this will just be like an easy
win that's what it looks like it's
really nice and light it doesn't have a
kind of coverage I know that I'll enjoy
using this product up because it fits
into what I really like right now but
since it's a click up pen I'm hoping I
can kind of get through it a little bit
faster than other things that I have in
my collection and just kind of move out
a full-size product in a relatively
decent amount of time so that's why I'm
talking to foam and it's just a kind of
a give me products
the next product is a contour and
highlighting stick from hard candy I did
a whole 4/5 first impressions on hard
candy items and I have this leftover I
have used this quite a bit it looks
really beat up because the packaging is
pretty cheap so yeah I just kind of want
to try to finish it up if not I'll
probably just get rid of it because it's
not something that I just absolutely
love I love my milk bronzing stick like
ten million times more than this and I
do like the Jordana one I have over this
as well and the highlighting portion of
this is just a little heavy so I want to
try to work through this and use it up
if I can maybe even just one side of it
but it's not at least I know that I'll
get rid of it because of this video at
the end of the year I have one brow
product and the rest are lip products
this is the brow brow Voe still is so
weird and hard to say these like made up
words Bravo conditioning primer from
benefit
I thought this just as a deluxe sized
sample and you twist it up and then you
run this like weird gel that comes out
through your brows I don't know I'm not
hating on it I kind of want to try it
out see if I like it and just kind of
make this a step I do and just use it up
this is our last product I feel like
it's really gimmicky but maybe it's
actually good if people actually would
use it so I'm gonna try it out I do have
three lip products in here and lip
products are the hardest for me I'm not
very good at using them up but hopefully
I can use these ones this one here is an
oldie but it was in a project like a
while ago it's from by Terry it's the
Rose contour lip pencil really pretty
color it's kind of similar to what I'm
wearing out but it isn't what I'm
wearing now I just have the tiniest
little bit on that so I think I can do
it this other one is from Jordana it's
the easy liner for lips in Tommy it's
not that I don't like this product it's
just I've had it a long time and I
probably should just get a new one
can you tell there's like a theme here I
like these kind of like more rosy news I
do really like that color though it's
really pretty and last is this Dior lip
glow in the color oh I think it's just
the original there was no color
selection when I bought this I've used
up a good portion of this I've been
trying to use this lately and it's
really really pretty I do like it on the
list leave the names like la see hot
pink on my lips and there's something
about just an effortless like glossy
sexy lip like this like it's just kind
of like I'm not trying hard but it looks
good I don't know I really like that
look so I hope that I can really get
into this and just finish it up because
I spent a lot of money on it and
something they don't like the product
it's just haven't used it in a long long
time that I've had this those are the
products that I want to use up by the
end of the year at the moment I don't
know if I'm going to be just keeping up
with this video and like doing an update
at the end of the year or maybe like a
halfway point or if I'm going to just
have these items and then put them in
other projects or whatnot I don't know
what I'm doing but I wanted to share
them with you guys kind of hold myself
accountable and hopefully actually get
some of these guys used up so thank you
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
the video and I will see you in my next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
