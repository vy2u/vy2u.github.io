Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing a bit of a different
video I don't know if I've seen this
before on YouTube but I was on the
Sephora website I was deciding what I
want to spend my 20 off a $50 coupon on
and I went to the sale section and then
I was like not surprised that's on sale
yeah I knew that would be there so I
thought it would be a fun video to talk
about the products that I am not
surprised are in the sale section on the
Sephora website I don't know how long
this video is going to be relevant in
the sense that things might sell out or
they might change things that are going
on line in the sales section I know
they're doing the like weekly wow thing
but I feel like a lot of these aren't
part of the weekly Wow I think a lot of
them are things they're trying to like
kind of get rid of and I thought it'd be
fun to talk about why I'm like yeah yeah
that's why it's there let me know if
you'd like to see like the reverse of
this like items that I'm surprised are
on sale I think that'd be kind of a cool
video as well I have 9 different items
to talk about so let's get into it the
first thing that I was like are you
kidding me this is already on sale I
mean I'm not surprised but I'm also just
like wow is the Becca app race key globe
collection this retails for $45 it's on
sale for 29 right now on the sephora
website as I'm filming this video and I
feel like that could get so much hype
and honestly I'm just like not impressed
and I don't mean that in a mean way I
think that they come out with some
really nice products but like I'm just
over these same shimmery shades I see
from them all the time this is an
eyeshadow palette but honestly it just
looks like a bunch of different
highlighters and maybe like one dark
kind of burgundy shade I was not
surprised this was on sale although it
just came out I mean like this I feel
like just came out so I feel bad for
anyone who bought this thing pool price
like seriously it never like interested
me but yeah it's on sale if you want it
it's on sale next are the Too Faced
melted latex high shine lipsticks these
retails for $21 and you can get them
right now on sale for 10 on Sephora's
website sometimes they have like from 10
to 21 so I'm not sure if all of the
shades are
sale I went through and looked and it
seemed like most of them but I am not
surprised these around sale you guys we
are barely getting back to Colossus like
I'm finally hearing people talk about
glosses and I'm like it's a miracle
matte lipsticks were the rage
they were King for so long and to come
out with something I feel like just I
don't I don't think just these are not
made for humans to honey
I've seen some people review these in a
positive light and I'm just like you'll
be trying to keep on that PR list or
something girl you just seem pretty
goopy to me I they look heavy on the
lips it just seems like a mess waiting
to happen your hair gets in them you're
screwed like I feel like they're not a
practical lip product I can see them
totally working for like editorial stuff
or for like Instagram looks but for
everyday people to go out and buy these
mmm no I'm not surprised I'm not
surprised they are on the sale section
the next item is the tart goddess glow
highlighter this retails originally for
$35 it's on sale on Sephora's website
for 25 I heard pretty bad reviews on
this lip loves makeup hated this item
and it's kind of a shame because I feel
like they put a lot of like work into
the packaging and to the like pressing
of this item because the powder is
pressed so pretty
but if the product can't perform it's
not gonna sell like people don't want
crap products and at this point so many
people have tried so much stuff like you
cannot pull one over on us
as much anymore like even people who are
obsessed with makeup are kind of like
waking up a little bit so yeah I'm not
surprised after I heard lives review
that this is on the sale section of the
website because I don't think people
liked it the next item is the Smashbox
create and transform masterclass palette
this retails for $65 an ounce at $45
honestly I feel like the Smashbox master
class palettes always end up on the sale
section so I kind of almost never
suggest buying them full price because
at some point they're gonna go on sale
they never sell out
I feel like Smashbox does not get enough
recognition I don't think that the
set is necessarily bad I'm sure the
quality is actually pretty nice they
just don't get the packaging right it
just doesn't make me want it I don't
know I just there's something about the
way that these things look that I'm just
like not feeling also I don't like that
they have like the whole thing dedicated
to lip products that are like in a pan
form I don't think a lot of people like
that it's kind of a lot of money for
people just to like splash out on
something that is not super beautiful
looking and Smashbox obviously just
doesn't get talked about a lot on
YouTube I know they're liquid lipsticks
we're getting some like rave reviews her
a little bit but they just need some
more positive PR I think to be more
successful so I was not surprised based
on past things and based on just how it
looks that this was on the sale site or
page not site number 5 is Z palette now
I'm not surprised this is on the sale
section because after the whole Z
palette Fiasco and horrible customer
service that they had a lot of brands
we're trying to distance themselves from
Z palette and I have a feeling that's
why this is on did like the discounted
page it's their double-sided palette
which originally retailed for $45 and it
is at a deep discount at $22 that's
pretty big some of these things are not
nearly at half and this is over 50% off
of the original price that's a better
price than I could get it at like meme's
or any professional makeup store so you
know they are trying to get rid of
things I have a whole video on the Z
palette thing if you guys want to type
it out I have like a tube top on it
anyway it's probably not the opinion you
guys want to hear but you know it's the
opinion I have alright number six this
is a Sephora collection item and it is a
tinted brow freeze it's retails
originally for $12 it's on sale for five
now honestly I'm not surprised that
anything of the Sephora collection is on
sale section a lot of people aren't
buying Sephora collection stuff if
you're on YouTube like you just like
leave that stuff behind and you go for
other things I would love to see some
like reviews especially of like
permanent items in their collection
things that aren't like just coming out
limited edition with the Sephora
collection because you know if they have
a really great like brow pencil or
something like that that could be a
go-to for someone I think that would be
great information to have but when it
comes to them like pushing out like
limited-edition things or things that
really don't run for a long time I'm not
surprised when they go on the sale
section now specifically why I thought
this was an interesting product to talk
about is because this thing is just like
a fat nasty brow pencil I'm sorry the
amount of people that this is gonna work
for it's so slim it's just not a project
reminds me of the Maybelline one that
came out it's just like it works for
like in the first use and it's just not
practical I'm just not surprised
anything in this form or in of this
concept when it comes to brow products
is on sale ever if people are buying it
it's like you guys have never tried to
do your brows in your life all right
next is another Tarte product this is
the Tarte rainforest of the sea kiss and
blush cream cheek and lip palette now
I'm kind of sad I mean uh not sad to see
it on sale because it's great if people
can get it at a discount but I'm not
surprised this is on sale because cream
cheek products and lip products in a
palette form are just not popular
products so as much as you know I think
that these have a place in like I don't
think that they should not not be made I
think that brands should keep making
these products I think that's a more
clear way of saying that but I know
they're definitely not gonna be you know
hotcakes they're not selling off the
shelves they're not being sold out and
we're not waiting for restocks for a
cream blush palette so I'm not surprised
that this product is finally on the sale
page it took a while but it's there I
didn't tell you but the Tarte originally
retailed for $42 and now it's on sale
for 34 the next item from Kat Von D I am
like finally it's on sale because they
were pushing the freaking rock candy set
so hard I'm like they're trying to act
like this thing is new like honey you
guys not new that thing's been out
forever no one wants it I'm not trying
to be rude I think that Kat Von D is a
great brand they're one of the brands
that I am excited for new releases from
but this was just not an exciting set it
was just kind of weird to me it came out
of a weird time it wasn't holiday just
it was just strange so it originally
retailed for $30 in health on sale for a
great discount at $27 I'm like okay you
still don't get it like put it out an
actual discount and I think it might
sell I feel very passionate about this
one but it's just because I
remember seeing it so many places on
Instagram you could tell they got it for
free and it just felt very like forced
it didn't feel like people naturally
gravitated to this product or wanted
this release it felt like I'm showing
this off because I got NPR or something
I don't know anyway that's just my
thoughts on that and the last item that
was on the Sephora sale section that I
wasn't surprised at but I was a little
bit sad about is a Korean or k-beauty
brand and this is cho seunga 22 I did
see a couple people review this stuff
when it first came out I believe they
got it sent to them in PR or somehow it
was in a boxer I don't know they got
their hands on it somehow and the reason
this brand is on sale I'm sure is
because they have decided to stop
carrying it I feel like it's only been
in Sephora I think maybe a year and I
don't even know if it was like an online
exclusive thing only but everything from
the brand is on sale they had a couple
of really cool products one is like this
jelly like eyeshadow palette it's very
similar I guess to like the super shock
shadow so that was something I had seen
reviews on so the eyeshadows retailed
originally for $39 now they're nineteen
fifty and then the men of brow maker
retailed originally for 22 and now it's
11 and this is kind of like a really
weird product it has like a foam tip on
the end like sculpt and draw on but then
it has a little bit of like a spoolie to
brush through some really innovative
products I was reading on the Sephora
website and it was like telling me a
little bit about the brand and I guess
the creator of this makeup line is a
makeup artist and is one of the most
well known makeup artists there in Korea
so it's like I'm kind of you know sad
that this didn't take to a Western
audience but I also kind of get it in a
way too because I feel like they make up
trends and styles are just so different
from each other American and just like
more Western I guess makeup is so heavy
and so just like in your face that you
know cream products and more light
weight or sheer products just they're in
as popular we want pigmentation and
structure and sculpting whereas I feel
like more k-beauty and just I think in
general more like a
beauty is more about skin care more
about a glowing or like a light look to
eyeshadows and like maybe a sheer
shimmer or something also when it comes
to range of the actual like base
products it just doesn't have a base
range there's like two shades you know
and it's just not gonna do well when
there's so many different skin tones
that you would need to cater to so
anyway I'm a little sad because I really
would love to try more of this but
seeing something like this happen I'm
sure it discourages them from taking on
similar brands in the future so
hopefully not but yeah anyway um yeah
those are some of my thoughts let me
know what your thoughts are on these
products down below that's everything
thank you so so much for watching guys I
hope you enjoyed the video and I will
see you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
