Lauren thank you so much for watching
first off I want to say that I do have a
tutorial on this look if you are
interested I'm gonna leave that link
down below or it'll be coming up soon
either one just know that it's coming in
case you ever were like hey I really
want to do look like that it was
inspired by an Instagram post so yeah
anyway that's coming up the other thing
I wanted to say is that I think we're
all gonna be really sad when this
Christmas tree background dies and it's
not Christmas anymore so I'm gonna be
working on creating a really fun
background for my like normal setup this
has inspired me so much you guys love it
I freaking die because it's so me it's
so fun it's making me so inspired to
create videos I really like the lighting
I think the lighting is so much better
over here for whatever reason so yeah
that is something that I'm working on
just to kind of let you guys know so
this video is going to be long it's
gonna be so long and I'm not just saying
that I mean it this is going to be a mix
between kind of like a monthly makeup
basket as well as me telling you all the
products that I'm bringing to Arizona
with me me and Sam we're going over
there for the holidays I'm sure I'd
mentioned it in a million videos by now
so I thought I would just show you guys
the makeup that I'm going to be bringing
now by no means should anyone ever bring
this much makeup ever when they travel
the reason I'm bringing so much is
because we will be there for two weeks
and I do have quite a few new things so
I want to be able to test them and not
like have that time basically go to
waste I want to be able to try out
different looks and do things like that
also the weather is very different over
there it's very dry and so I need more
moisturizing products and I just like to
have a couple different things just in
case things aren't working out so that
is why I have so much stuff in here I
will have a couple other like beauty
related items at the end I just want to
show you guys well without further ado
we're gonna get into it so I can make
this video not twenty minutes but it
probably will be that being said I'm
gonna be running through these really
fast and not giving a ton of like
reviews it's mostly just showing you
what I'm bringing this is gonna be in no
order because it's just too much stuff
in front of me so the first thing that
I'm going to be bringing is the electric
palette now I mostly bring this just for
the pink shade although the one in the
hood of beauty obsessions palette I
think might work just as well but either
way
gonna bring this just because I love it
I can trust this pink I know I love it
so I want to bring that I really wish I
had it in a single I should just de pot
it I feel like but I'm scared what if we
lose it guys the next one that I'm
bringing is the color pop all I see is
magic palette I've used this one only
once sadly I did a very red look I
filmed in it but I did not film the
tutorial for it so I just want to play
around with this more so I can get a
review up for you guys like I've
mentioned also in videos I'm going to be
doing like a collective palette review
once I have tried out the palettes I've
recently got enough to give really good
opinions on them I'm throwing it back
and I'm bringing an oldie but a goodie
this is the ice cream palette and I love
this palette but I really haven't used
it in a while so I thought this would be
fun has a matte cream shade I love the
shade cone sherbert that's just like a
really easy look but then the does have
some really fun colors so I thought that
would be fun to bring in case I wanted
to do something a little different and
my golly if that wasn't enough I'm also
going to be bringing all of the huda
beauty obsessions palettes I have the
electric obsession which is what I use
to create the look I'm wearing today
really pretty fun and colorful the
smokey palette which is really beautiful
as well if I want to do something really
like basic and then I'm bringing these
two just to like test them more this one
is the mauve palette you guys have seen
all these but you know I only should
show you them and then this one is the
warm brown so that should I mean I think
that should be enough eyeshadow what do
you guys think
no it'll be plenty of eyeshadow I'm
bringing mac fix+ one for my skin too to
foil shadows I just love this stuff so
much and I'm probably just gonna have to
buy any one for my kit cuz I'm basically
taking this one over for bronzers I'm
bringing two different bronzers this one
is the bronze goddess from Estee Lauder
I really love this one this gives a nice
finish to the skin it's not overly matte
but it's not like shimmery really like
this and then I brought the hoola light
as well just because I have been using
this recently and enjoy it so I thought
having these two options would be enough
for the time that I'm there I'm also
bringing two blushes which I don't know
I don't know what or during filming and
uploading all of this stuff but if
you've seen the other videos
sure you guessed oh I'm bringing rocket
or which is one of my all-time favorite
blushes so pretty it just goes with
every single look and then I'm going to
be bringing the Tarte in party I also
think this one goes with every look and
this one's matte so it just is if I
don't want extra sheen on my skin I will
go with the cart one almost drafted for
highlighters I'm bringing two different
options one I'm bringing my trusty urban
decay looking eye shadow an illusion
this is limited edition from the Glinda
the Good Witch palette I want to hit pan
on this so bad so I'm focusing on it I'm
really trying to we'll see if I can get
it done and then just in case I want to
spice it up or do something a little bit
more I am gonna bring the kiss halo
strobing palette this one's really
really nice I talked about it more at
the beginning of the year but I do love
this it has a bunch of different shades
and all of them work on my skin tone
which is amazing so that will be fun to
play around with if I'm doing something
special for holiday or New Year's next
let's talk about primers because I'm
bringing quite a few the first one is
actually depotted this is my heart candy
sheer envy primer I'm just trying to
finish it up so I'm gonna bring it I
also have this primer that I'm trying to
finish up in my project pan this is the
cover effects blurring primer so I'm
bringing that and then my skin tends to
get pretty dry out there so I'm bringing
the coqui smooth Club hydrating primer
it just adds a bit of moisture it's a
nice base I do like it I just want to
get more progress on it and sometimes I
find them with the hard candy one if my
skin isn't super hydrated because I
think it does have quite a bit of
silicone in it it can be smoothing but
my dry patches can still be emphasized
so this will hopefully help counteract
that and then for even more of a glow
I'm bringing the one over one sheer
light base glow I've actually really
been enjoying this product it smells
kind of like strange like kind of rosy
and it's not my favorite scent but I
think the product works really well it
gives you a luminous glow without having
too heavy of a product on your skin I've
been using it quite a bit
I might mix this with foundation but
most of the time how I use it is I'll
put it on before foundation but after
primer let's talk about foundations
and bringing three different foundation
type products I this was me cutting it
down because I usually mix my
foundations I'll mix a different
foundation every day with like the same
base one I'm crazy so it was hard guys
I'm so hard first though I'm bringing
the number seven city light tinted
moisturizer I've been enjoying this to
add in and give extra moisture plus I've
just been enjoying like a lighter base
so I will be bringing this along I also
let that have SPF in it I'm also gonna
be bringing my tried-and-true trusty
little guy this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation I have the shade 117
or y2 25 marble or whatever I just love
this foundation it's so good so I just
wanted to make sure I had the one that I
love the most and then I'm also bringing
something that's quick and easy and this
is the tint idol ultra wear makeup stick
I have it in the shade 110 ivory I'm
almost finished with this and I just
really like this product it's simple
it's easy if I'm trying to just get
ready and get out the door this will be
really nice probably like a Christmas
morning type of product or this is or
both of them oh I should try that
something I'm not sure if I'm gonna use
but if I find that my skin is really dry
and I have a little extra time I'm gonna
be using them milk makeup stick bronzer
it's just like a cream you guys know I
really like this product so I'm bringing
it sometimes I don't have time to use it
but I want it as an option I'm bringing
every single mascara I have open I just
got done using the Urban Decay
perversion sample like it's just done
I'm not gonna bring it with me there's
barely anything left so I'm bringing the
monster big by Lancome I'm bringing the
Tarte lights camera lashes this is the
ciate London Wonderland mascara and then
I have the number seven lash Impact
mascara so between all of these
hopefully I can get some of them
finished or decide if like it's not
worth it because I cannot wait to open
my name perversion I can't wait
but I want to get these done before I do
that I'm ringing four different liner
options I really don't need to bring
this money I probably could get away
with two but i'm excessive and they're
so small why not bring them so this one
is a white liner from colour-pop it's in
the shade exit I usually use a white
liner on my waterline every single day
is Max Costa reach it's just a really
nice brown liner I like to tightline
with this or put a little on the lower
lash line this is something new to me
the elf waterproof liner in coffee
really love this this has been like the
one I've been using the most out of all
of these so I will definitely be
bringing that and then to act like I'm
gonna use this because it is in a
project ban I'm bringing the Urban Decay
stash liner which I have not been making
a lot of progress on but maybe I'll get
some inspiration at the end of the year
I don't know I thought I'd just bring it
just in case when it comes to powders
and bringing two different ones these
are the two that you guys have been
seeing me using my get ready with me is
there's like the two basic ones I've
been using this is the kiss setting
powder it's just a translucent I like
setting this under my eyes and my t-zone
I just love a translucent powder and I'm
so close to being done with this which
I'm kind of sad about but happy to like
get through a product but I'm gonna need
to purchase a translucent powder after
this this is the Clarins everlasting
compact foundation powder this is really
nice it's just like a lightweight powder
I use to set the rest of my face and I
went out of order tonight I did have one
single eyeshadow that I'm bringing along
and this one is kind of a weird one but
in my four or more tab which again don't
know if it's up if it is it'll be linked
if not it's coming I mentioned this
eyeshadow this is silk rose from
bareMinerals
and I kind of want to just do like a one
shadow look with it so I'm bringing it
in case I get inspired to do that so
yeah I want to use that really bad just
a few last little eye things I am
bringing the elf eyebrow pencil I'm
probably gonna bring it back up because
this one's almost done I'm also bringing
the elf clear brow gel this is the
naturally bare sheer clear tint one love
this stuff I've really been enjoying it
and then I did finish my color pop so I
made a color pop order they had 20% off
and I've ordered quite a few brow
pencils and those are gonna be shipped
to my mom's house so when I get there I
can have good brows because oh my gosh
looking back at some of the makeup I've
done in the past when it comes to my
brows which I know in this makeup look I
don't know how seriously you can take me
but man my brows were like soup
heavy and I thought that was like good
so I definitely don't want to be without
that brow pencil anyway
that I will also be using once I get
there and it shows up at the door for
primer I'm just bringing my ELF one
really I've been loving that and then I
am bringing my Urban Decay heavy metal
liner in Distortion
no pyro love this stuff this will be
great for New Year's Eve if I want to do
something too so yeah those are like the
rest of the eye products I'm bringing I
just have a few more things I know I
were really speeding through this I'm
pretty happy I'm bringing just three lip
products I mean I might have some other
ones in my purse but this is why I'm
bringing this is the Sol de Janeiro
Brazilian kiss lip butter this is going
to be a nice just like moisturizing lip
balm hello I'm bringing my fenty lip
gloss this is probably the thing we'll
use the most and then if I'm feeling
really cheeky I'll use this pink one
from NYX this is the butter gloss in D
shade Eclair really really pretty shade
really like this one on its own and it
just adds this really pretty pink tint I
love it when I have the pink on my
eyebrows so yeah that's what I'm
bringing for lips and the last couple of
things here are just kind of like random
Beauty things or things I got sent from
octoly that I want to talk to you guys
about just for a moment I'm bringing
this razor because I need to shave my
eyebrows and my chin hairs and my lip
hairs and I don't wanna be without it I
don't want it to be Christmas and I'm
like hairy as heck so I'm yeah I'm
bringing this you guys know I just like
keep it real with you like if you don't
have hairy girl problems I'm so happy
for you but that's not my life I wanted
to mention this quick toothbrush I'm
bringing this with me I've had this for
about two weeks and I love it I'm going
to have a full review on it but I just
want to mention it here I think I do
have some type of discount code through
octal II but I don't get any like
Commission I don't get it's not
affiliated to me where I make any money
but anyway I love this thing it's an
electronic toothbrush I love that it
comes in a nice carrying case it's like
perfect for traveling for the holidays
it has this little like stand type of
situation and look at that fancy a
toothbrush it's electric it's electric
it's an electric toothbrush and I've
really been enjoying using this ever
since
got it I'm like excited to brush my
teeth anyway I've just been enjoying
this I like the way this is I'm gonna
have a full-on review I just wanted to
at least mention it a couple of you guys
were saying you wanted to see the review
so it will be coming probably after the
new year when I get back because I don't
think I'm gonna be filming any videos
while I'm there I'm just gonna put up
whatever pre-recorded videos I have so
that's really awesome to use it came
with a mini of the toothpaste which I
really enjoy the toothpaste again
something really weird but I'm kind of
picky when it comes to toothpaste like
the taste and texture and all that so
I'm really happy to have this in a small
container to bring with us and the last
thing here that was sent to me from
Hockley which I ordered a long time ago
and it just got here like I was scared I
wasn't even gonna get this before we
left but this is from sol de janeiro you
guys know i love their stuff and this is
their number one top rated product it's
the boom boom cream and I never wanted
to try it because I didn't want a
full-size of it cuz I'm not someone who
loves lotion but I love their products
so much so when I saw this set come on
on octel II I was like oh my gosh I
really want to try it so I'm gonna keep
one for myself and then I'm gonna be
bringing the rest of these to Arizona to
give away to my mom and someone else I
don't know who but I thought I would
share this with you guys and let you
know I will come back and give you guys
a review on what I think about this
although the smell is so good it smells
just like the other products and I did
put a little bit of this on and it's not
overly greasy which i think is amazing
so I will come back and let you know I
think this kid is like a pretty good
deal if you wanted to like try it out
and like split it between three of your
friends if you all wanted to try it
although this is small like this is a
pretty small size so I don't know man
this this cream is expensive like I know
the products are expensive but the other
ones I've tried I'm like I can justify
it I'm not sure if I could justify the
lotion given this size like I think this
is the little travel and I'm like woah
this is tiny
is this like twenty dollars I don't know
yeah okay guys that's everything I'm
bringing to Arizona these are mostly the
items I've been using the last like two
weeks and I'm going to be using the next
two weeks so there's my makeup basket -
I hope you guys enjoyed thank you so so
much for watching I'm starting to get
sick oh it's horrible I'm gonna stop
talking I just want to talk to you guys
and my
chat but another video another time I
hope you guys are having an amazing day
and I will see you in my next video bye
