channel it's Lauren this is going to be
an update on one of my beauty
resolutions for the year which was
keeping track of all the makeup that I
purchased this year I am really trying
to control what I'm bringing into my
collection and make really good
purchases and things that I actually
will enjoy and not just buying things to
buy things this year so one of the ways
I wanted to help with that was to write
down every single makeup item that I
purchased on a piece of paper so that I
could see what I'm bringing in and how
much I'm spending a month and then total
that up for the year so since we're
about a quarter of the way through 2016
I thought I would share with you the
purchases that I've made I haven't done
any haul videos this year because really
there hasn't been much to haul I'm
really happy with where I'm at so far
other than that just to let you know as
well anything that I've gotten for free
cuz I have got like the Anastasio glow
kits for free and a couple other things
I'm not including that in this hall or
in this video this is just the items I
actually spent money on I think that
because I actually decided to spend the
money on them that those are more
important purchases to me at least and
more what I'm trying to track this year
so I broke it down by month what I've
got and I got a lot of stuff for free in
January and I also did purchase some
things because I did go to two different
trade shows that month I went to I'm at
and then generation Beauty was at the
end of the month lots of free stuff and
then a couple things about so let's get
into that sorry to ramble I believe my
first purchase for the year was this la
splash studio shine lip lustre this is
in the color Katrina and this is one of
like their duochrome
matte liquid lipsticks um that is a
swatch of it there I don't know if it's
gonna show the duochrome
this was something I had been wanting a
long time I had been seeing it on
Instagram as well as on YouTube Donovan
I don't know his full channel name but
he is always wearing it it always looks
so good on him so that is why I wanted
it so when I saw it at I'm at I was like
I'm definitely getting it that's
something I've been wanting for a really
long time I am happy with this this was
$14 at the show I haven't worn it
but I have worn it and it's definitely
not like anything else in my collection
the next thing I got was a beauty
blender like trio pack so it actually
came with one other beauty blender and
then a micro mini ax so three beauty
blenders and one micro mini for 35
dollars and it came with a little mini
cleanser as well so I thought this was
just an amazing deal it's less than the
price of the two Beauty blenders with
the cleanser which is like an amazing
deal and I couldn't pass it up so I just
wanted to have backups I just thought
since the Beauty Blender is like
basically the only tool I used to blend
products onto my face considering my
like face makeup I thought I would spend
35 more dollars get three ones as
backups have the little micro mini which
I didn't really care about and you know
save some money by buying it no really
happy with my purchase I gave the pink
one to my mom because she wanted to try
it out again she didn't really like it
the first time she used it but she's
gonna try it again and see if she likes
it
really happy with this purchase this was
an amazing deal it looks kind of gross
because the Beauty Blender product kind
of leaked out on my bad
but this was an awesome purchase really
happy I got this so the next product I
just want to just kind of give it a
little bit of a intro and also I'm gonna
have a look at the camera because I'm
ashamed so this is something I bought
and I considered not showing you guys it
for really long time but that to me is
like lying almost and that's totally not
my style but you know I realized the
fact that I don't want to show it to you
guys and don't want to use it with you
guys means that I am ashamed and I
shouldn't purchase it so don't hate me
too much I'm trying to be honest and
open with you guys but I did this so I
bought a lime cry and product I know I
know we don't need to go into it
definitely don't want to buy anymore
because I went for it and I feel guilty
as hell so okay this is from lime prime
this is the color peacock this is
something
than any other color that I've seen on
the market if you guys know any good
dupes let me know it is like a dark blue
but it's still super blue it doesn't
look black I mean it looks super blue
and I bought that so yeah I feel again
sad that I bought this I don't know I'm
not gonna get too much into it I know a
lot of people hate Lime Crime and I get
why people hate Lime Crime and I don't
want to support that and yet I still did
because I wanted this item I think after
buying this I realized that I just don't
want to do that anymore and I want to
feel happy with my purchases more than
just oh I like the color but I'm ashamed
of the brand like I don't want to deal
with that anymore so I'm showing you now
and know that I know waiting to get into
it but yeah I bought this this was 16
dollars and it came with like a free
lipstick too which I don't even want but
that's in my collection as well I didn't
buy this for the free lipstick or
anything it just happened to come with
it at the trade show anyway that's
enough of this it's really pretty and I
do like it but I regret it not because
of the price or because I spent money on
it just because it's Lime Crime and I
wish I didn't give in and buy it that
took so much courage I was so ashamed
y'all next one I think that's everything
I bought in January actually no it's not
I bought one more set of stuff in
January the last thing that I bought in
January was stuff from pure minerals
this I bought at generation Beauty this
is the pure foreign one Presta
foundation this is in the color light
and that is what it looks like I really
enjoy this product it is quite glowy
throughout the day so I don't feel like
it stays really nicely and then it came
with the brush because of the show so I
bought both of these for seventeen
dollars and it set together I thought
that was a really good deal I think the
powder sells by itself for like twenty
nine and I am really happy with this
purchase so far and this isn't like Holy
Grail powder foundation for me I
definitely want to branch out and try
other powder foundations but I am glad I
got this one I do think it's good it's
just I'm on the hunt still for something
that will suit my oily skin better so
that is actually
everything that I bought in January so
my total for January came to 82 dollars
I think that's pretty good
I know 82 dollars is still a lot of
money but it's under 100 and I had to
trade I went to to trade shows I mean
two major makeup trade shows that I am
surprised that I did not go absolutely
him at which I know
had it been a year earlier had it been
two years earlier
lord knows my credit card would be like
broken in half because I swiped it so
much now let's go into February for the
things about in February I did kind of
buy a lot but I haven't bought anything
in March at all and I don't plan to so
I've kind of okay with that as well so
the first things I bought in February
were two concealers I bought these
because I had run out of concealer and
that's an awesome feeling so this is the
Maybelline fit me this is in the color
Fair 15 Fair
this is probably my absolute favorite
concealer I've ever used it's so cheap
it works so well I have great coverage
it doesn't leave me cakey I can use it
under my eyes I can use it to cover
blemishes I just love this concealer I
love it so yes repurchase like a million
times and I do like it this was $7.99 at
CVS I will never buy my makeup at CVS I
think it's bull crap and I know a lot of
you guys like like the rewards and
I'm sorry I'm getting very very upset
about this I know you guys like the
rewards but I think that they're just
it's bull crap you want me to spend
these two concealers came out to like 20
dollars because I think this came out to
1079 then because about two Maybelline
products are spent over $15 a Maybelline
I got five dollars back but you have to
have the coupon I did redeem it and got
my five dollars but I'm just saying you
have to have the coupon it expires in
like a month after you do it like no I
just want to spend the lower amount of
money immediately and then I can come
back to your establishment and spend
more money but not at an extinct and
insane price I don't know not into it
but anyway it's so irritating
then the other concealer I bought
because I knew I wanted this one but
then I kind of wanted to try something
else and I was okay with getting two
concealers so this is the instant age
rewind also by Maybelline
again I told you this cost like 10 27
1079 which i think is insane this is
going insanely fast I just filmed my
intro for finish 6 by summer and that's
where the line was and just in one day
so much product is gone I don't like
this product nearly as much as I like
this one
I'm not saying it's not good I just
think it's more expensive it goes faster
even though I use this one really fast I
don't know it's just ok I just prefer
this one I bought those two things
though in February I'm happy with those
purchases because I did need them like I
went out to buy them because I needed
concealer I wasn't just like browsing
and perusing and picked up like $20
worth of concealer the next bunch of
stuff is all from an order I placed on
Ulta calm I wanted the peanut butter and
jelly palette I feel like I've talked
about this palette so much and finally
I'm gonna show its little face on here
this is the peanut butter and jelly
palette you guys have all seen it a
million times
I'm super happy with this palette really
happy I got it this was $36 I really
wanted to make sure that I got it
because it's limited edition I believe
and I just knew I would love it and I do
so super happy with this purchase and I
wanted to make sure I got free shipping
because it just there's something about
paying for shipping that XBee I would
rather spend like 14 extra dollars to
get free shipping then spend like $6.99
on shipping and not spend as much like
in my head it's totally justifiable so I
wanted to add things to my cart that I
felt like I would actually use I decided
to go for all drugstore I don't know why
I think I wanted to like try it a couple
different things and just be able to get
more bang for my buck I got two of the
Maybelline definer brows I knew I'd be
able to go through these really fast and
that I did like them and I'm running low
on brow products or the two that I have
are getting really close to being
finished so I thought that this would be
a wise purchase and something that would
stop me from buying makeup in the future
these are in the color dark blog I do
believe it's the lightest shade and for
both of these because they were
maybelline s buy one get one half off it
was $6.99 for both of these which i
think is a really good deal even though
I go through them really fast I think
it's worth it two more things and then
that's it so one of the things I bought
I kind of bought because I was
reminiscing on it this is the
Maybelline Dream matte mousse this is in
the color light and I don't know why I
wanted this I remember my stepsister
would use this and it just brought back
like old memories for me I have tried
using this once or twice you cannot use
it with a beauty blender it does not
work that way it works best with your
fingers to like actually push the
product into your skin the Beauty
Blender just like crimson would fall
onto my face so I kind of wish I didn't
get this I'm not like completely upset
but I didn't need this so it's just like
another foundation to go through as much
as I tried man this one snuck in my car
but I don't like hated enough to return
it so I'm gonna keep it and I think it
is a good base too for like using this
and then like a powder foundation or
like a powder that doesn't have a ton of
coverage to put over it I think would be
really nice anyway yeah I got that so I
don't know what do you guys think about
this have you used this in the past I
feel like I might get oily from it
that's the only thing I'm a little
nervous for her and that was 899 and the
last thing who and the last thing I got
was from essence this is a lip liner and
this is in the color in the nude
I will swatch it for y'all that's it
there I don't have a ton of lip liners
but I have been wearing nude lips lately
and I just thought I I just wanted to
try a lip liner that was inexpensive
that I could wear and line my lips one
of the things that I'm the most
self-conscious about when I do my own
makeup is my lip line I just feel weird
about it I don't do my lips often so I
feel like I don't get the practice every
single day so I thought a lip liner
would make some of those things feel a
little easier and a little better for me
and that was a dollar ninety-nine so in
total for the month of February
I spent seventy two dollars and ninety
three cents but I did place an order on
Ulta partially because I also had thirty
dollars in credit from I don't even know
one because I have not shopped at Ulta
in forever so I used that thirty dollars
toward my purchase so in actuality even
though all those things cost that much
in actuality I only spent forty two
dollars and ninety three cents in the
month of February I feel really happy
with where I'm at again
haven't spent any money in March on
makeup and I don't intend to spend any
money in March on makeup if anything all
wait until April so that this is
accurate but I feel really excited about
my progress in total for the whole year
so far four quarter one I have spent a
hundred and twenty four dollars and
ninety three cents I think that is such
an improvement I know that had it been
last year or the year before that I
would be at a couple hundred dollars by
now for sure like definitely a couple
hundred dollars would happen quite a few
new palettes in my collection and I'm
just happy with what I do have because
honestly once I let these things go once
I let the Gwen Stefani collection go and
once I like just other things I kind of
wanted go I don't want them now like I
don't like I kind of do what I really
don't want them and I'm just really
happy and satisfied with the way I've
been able to control my spending so far
this year and just to imagine all that
extra money that I would have sent a
makeup has been going toward books and
just other hobbies and interests just
makes me feel like a more well-rounded
person and I'm excited for that I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I will
update you again once if we get to like
halfway point of the year where I'm at
with makeup and I hope that however you
are trying to spend your money whether
you want to spend more money or less
money on makeup I hope that whatever
your goals are you're reaching them and
that you're sticking to them and if not
finding the motivation or the
encouragement through our community to
do that and to hit whatever goals you
have so that is everything I will see
you in my next video guys have a great
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
