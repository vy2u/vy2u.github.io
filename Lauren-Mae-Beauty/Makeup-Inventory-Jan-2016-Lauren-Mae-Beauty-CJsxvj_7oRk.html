it's Lauren this is going to be my
makeup inventory I thought I would start
the year out fresh I did my first makeup
inventory in February I will link that
down below and then I did a second one
in July so I will link that down below
as well
a few things I am a makeup artist so I
have a lot of makeup I decided not to
count anything that I consider like kit
makeup so anything that I would never
use on myself only on clients or
anything that's very specific to clients
I just don't count that as part of my
personal collection and also something
different I decided to do is I didn't
set any goals for myself I'm a makeup
lover I love makeup and honestly I just
find my goals are just always
unrealistic in the sense that either
they're too little or too low and
honestly my makeup collection will
always be kind of a breathing thing like
sometimes I'll have a lot sometimes I'll
have a little this is just a way for me
to kind of keep track of that pattern
and just kind of see my numbers on paper
and keep myself in check so I just
wanted to throw that out there it's not
like an excuse for me to grow my
collection because you guys all know I'm
super focused on really condensing my
collection down but that's really the
goal of my collection is to really have
things that I love only in my collection
not things I have loved or don't use
anyway let's get into this inventory I'm
just gonna do it all in one video so
it's gonna be a long one I'm not gonna
show you any products but I am planning
on doing some collection videos coming
up soon in the next year in this year so
for face products for foundations I have
10 foundations currently which is up to
from my most recent inventory BB creams
and tinted moisturizers I have six which
is up three from my last inventory
powders any type of face powders I have
13 which is the same for my last
inventory concealers I have five which
means I'm down one from last time
primers I have ten which means I'm down
four I've really worked on my primers
this year powder blushes I had 44 and
now I have 60 and these are all that are
in like single form that's up 16 cream
blushes I have eight and I
at eleven so I'm down three on those
powder bronzers I have 13 and I did have
12 so I'm up one on my bronzers powder
highlights
I have 16 which means I'm up six from
the ten I had last time
cream highlighters I have five and I
used to have six so I'm down one face
palette so any type of face palette with
two or more products in it I had 18 and
now I have 17 so I'm down one and last
cream bronzers I had one before and now
I have to account anything that's like a
cream contour type of product as a cream
bronzer so in total four face products
before I had 146 now I have a hundred
and sixty one so I am up sixteen now
fifteen products that's a little
disappointing only because I feel like I
don't know where those products came
from but I do think a lot of them came
from work and like taking stuff home so
it's just something I need to work
through I don't know if there's a ton of
stuff I just want to get rid of instead
it's just like taking time to use those
items not the best with face products
but we'll move on next our eye products
that will start off with brows in my
last update I had twelve brow products
now I have 16 which is up for I shadow
singles I have 36 now have 35 which is
down one yeah small palettes I decided
to condense some different categories so
I only have small palettes and large
palettes I got rid of duo's for small
palettes anything 6 or less with
eyeshadows I had 47 now I have 44 go me
that's down three large pellets which
are seven or more eyeshadows I had 42
and now I have 37 so I'm down 5 cream
shadows in a potted form I had 10 now I
have 6 on down for cream eyeshadows and
sticks I had 12 and I still have 12 so
I'm exactly the same pigments I had 23
and I still have 23 so I'm the same
glitters I had 21 and now I have 25 I
don't know where those came from I don't
know if I just miscounted last time or
what but I am a 4 for liquid eyeshadows
I had two I still have 2 so that is
exactly the same mascara I had 20 now I
have 19 so I'm down one eye primers I
had 11 now I
have each so I'm down three pencil
liners which are yeah I split up my
liner so pencil liners I had 39 now I
have 33 so I'm down six liquid liners I
had five now I only have two so I am
down three gel liners I had two and I
have one so I'm down one and then
glitter liners I had five and now I have
six which I know I haven't added to that
so I know that was just a miscount so
I'm up one technically I put glitter
adhesive and glue and seals all in one I
had three now I only have two and then
colored mascara I had to an eye of six a
lot of those have come from work I got a
lot of colored mascaras which I actually
don't use on my eyes I use in my brows
so in total before in the eye category I
had 292 products and now I have 277
which is down 15 products so between
this one and the face category I'm
completely even like no change at all so
it's all up to my lip products to see
where I'm at which I did amazing omlette
products I'm so happy with myself so
let's get into those again I just want
to say I did change up some of the
categories I just thought they were kind
of pointless and as I get rid of things
they don't have as many categories and I
don't feel like I need to split it up
and justify it as much or something
anyway lip liners I had one now I have
three which is up two lipsticks which is
coloured any type of like traditional
bullet lipstick I had 46 now I have 37
so I'm down 9 lip crayons anything in
the like jumbo lip cream type of family
so those ones the lorac ones the NARS
ones anything like that you sharpen are
you twist up whatever I had 35 now I
have 27 so I'm down 8 for liquid
lipsticks which are anything in a liquid
lipstick form I had 8 and I have 13 I
got a lot of those two-faced ones for
lip paints I had 4 now I have one I just
have techno pagan from
obsessive-compulsive Cosmetics and I'm
happy with that glosses I had 18 I have
16 so I'm down to I'm working on getting
that down lip balms I had 13 now I have
7 so I'm down 6 I feel great about that
tinted lip balms I had 19 now I have 15
I'm down for lip stains I had 3 now I
have none
I just got rid of them I didn't need
them in my life and so that's obviously
down three four lip treatments and
scrubs
I had three now I only have one left
that is the actual like lip treatment
from bite Beauty so that one's like a
huge one so I'm down two on that and
then lip palettes I had one and I still
have that palette but it's in my kit so
if I don't count it I'm not gonna use it
on myself I don't think so I'm just
going to keep that in my kit and not
count it as part of my personal
collection so that makes me down one so
in total for lip products I had one
hundred and sixty now I have a hundred
and twenty so I'm down forty I know
that's still an insane number I would
definitely like to get that down to
under a hundred this year and just again
really weed through and see what I'm
using you guys have noticed I hope that
I'm wearing
way different lip colors and I normally
do my videos I've just been enjoying
having lip products on so I'm really
trying to like go through and wear
everything I have and if I like it keep
it if I don't like it get rid of it and
I think it'll go well for me I thought I
would give you my totals for each
inventory so all my products added up in
February I had 650 products in July when
I counted them all up I had 590 products
and then now in December I have 558
products I think that is so amazing I've
almost gotten rid of a hundred products
out of my collection
and that is including like getting rid
of stuff and using stuff up but I've
also brought a ton of stuff in this year
to still be down 100 products with the
give and take I think that is so amazing
and I'm really excited to just continue
paring down my collection and just
enjoying the things I have and loving
them and only having things I'm truly
passionate about in my collection if you
haven't done a makeup inventory I
suggested to everyone just to kind of
get an idea of what you have in your
collection and to just get reacquainted
with your collection and really enjoy
and feel happy in the things that you
already have okay guys that is
everything for this video I will see you
in my next ones I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I'll see you
