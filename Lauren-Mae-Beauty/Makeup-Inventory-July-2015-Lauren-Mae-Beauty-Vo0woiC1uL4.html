this video is going to be my makeup
inventory update I didn't make an
inventory like one of my first videos on
my channel and it's been about six
months I did put the numbers down like
when I actually went through my
collection figured out what I had of all
my stuff it was februari six and then
when I went through my makeup collection
it was a couple days ago because I knew
it was going to be a process that was
july twenty fourth so I'm gonna go
through all the different like
categories of like face eyes and lips
but I'm gonna do it in one video instead
of three my last one was three separate
videos but this video is probably going
to be a little bit longer and that's the
reason I split it up in the first place
but I just kind of don't want to give a
disclaimer every single time before each
video so I'm just going to do it in one
video and let me know in the comments
down below what you think a couple
things before I get started i'm not
going to be showing any of the makeup in
this video this is just me going and
talking about numbers another thing is i
am a makeup artist or I'm going to
school to become a makeup artist so I do
have a lot of makeup it is a passion of
mine too the numbers are really high so
first off I didn't count anything in my
kit that is strictly used like at makeup
school like a lot of my been nine stuff
and things because those are things in
my personal collection so I didn't count
those as part of my inventory and also
because of the fact that I love makeup
and I want to use makeup as like part of
my career and everything I don't have
like a ton of set categories of how much
i want my biggest thing if my makeup
inventory is reminding me of what i have
in my collection you know sometimes when
you see the actual number like holy cow
i have 50 of those it kind of makes you
realize I could do I need all of those
are there some
I can live without and if anything just
reacquainting me with my collection it
just helps me to pare down my collection
in ways that I can although my
collection will always be large and I am
totally fine with that there are some
categories that I'm fine with growing as
long as I love everything and that
brings me to my second point about like
why I don't quite have a ton of like
strict goals for myself I want
everything in my collection be something
that I absolutely love so it's something
that i would recommend or i like because
of this or that because it's different
because of the formula something about
it is something that i absolutely love
and there's nothing in my collection
that I dressed don't like and if that is
the case and I want to work on like
using it up and moving it out or getting
rid of it or passing on or whatever I
need to do but i want my collection to
be a representation of me if someone
randomly were to come and open my
drawers and pick out like a full face of
makeup all those products would be
something I would recommend and be
awesome for them so that's my little
disclaimer about personally my goals and
why I do my makeup inventory let's get
into it oh I broke my patty boys down
pretty small i guess in each category so
let's just get into it we're going to do
face products first four foundations on
in February I had 11 and my goal was
five and now i have a mi goal is still
five I feel really good about that have
used up a lot of foundations and I'm on
my way to working out a lot more I'm not
someone that's like a foundation person
like they're not fun for me to shop for
so I know that's why I don't have a ton
of them but I'm excited to work those
down and then get some really good ones
instead of just using up ones i have
like actually loving foundations for BB
creams and tinted moisturizers on in
February I had three and I wanted three
and in july i have three and i want
three so no change there i'm totally
fine with that number for powders in
February I had 17 and my goal was five
now I have 13 and my goal is still about
five I don't need a ton of them at least
in my own personal collection I'm
working my way down I'm down
on that one for concealers in February I
had seven and I wanted five now I have
six and I want five so i did go down one
there for face primers i had 16 and I
wanted seven and now I have 14 and I
want seven still so i'm down to from
februari on my primers I'm working
really hard on those this year because I
know primaries are one of the things I
love to test out and use because I have
oily skin I'm excited that that one has
seen some progress only in like six
months or so you guys will tell me if
I've lipstick on my teeth 34 powder
blushes I had 46 in February and I don't
have a goal for it and then now I have
44 and I still don't have a goal for it
so I believe I declutter two of those at
some point which is great I have room
for other ones there's so many that i do
want and i know that i'm too cluttered
quite a few because i have gotten quite
a few blushes well I've gotten at least
like three that i can think of so that's
great for cream blushes in February I
had 20 and I wanted five and now I have
11 and I want five how too cluttered
quite a few my cream blushes I just
don't I don't need that many cream
blushes there's no way I can go through
them so I'm working hard to just like
not buy any more and work through the
ones i have but i definitely don't need
more than 54 powder bronzers i had 15 in
February and my goal was 10 and now I
have 12 and my goal is still 10 so I'm
down 34 cream bronzers I had three and
my goal was one and now I've decluttered
two of them so I only have one and i'm
at my goal so that's great I just don't
need a bunch of cream bronzers it's not
something that I use I don't go really
hardcore with like contouring and
highlighting with cream or anything and
so I don't I just don't need it in my
collection for powder highlight in
February I had 12 and my goal I could
have up to 20 and right now I have 12
powder highlights and again I can go up
to 20 and I'd still feel really great
about that so lots of room for growth
which is exciting for cream highlighters
in February I had seven and my goal was
to have three or four and now i am down
to six and Michael
still three or four so I have some room
to work on getting that number down
design my sense I have some work to do
to get the number down but I am down 14
face palette which I just did anything
anything with two or more products in it
I had 18 because they had two separate
categories i had a face palette and face
Jose and I just combined them together
as face palette so anything over to in
February combining those two categories
i had 18 and I don't have a goal for
those and then I still have 18 right now
and I don't have a goal for those I love
blush palettes bronzer palettes
highlighting bronzer blush palette
they're one of my favorite things as
well as like large eyeshadow palette so
I don't have goals for any of those I
just want to make sure that everything
in that category is something that I
absolutely love and that I use or that I
am rotating out if I have so many or
whatever ok so now on to eyes her brows
in February I had nine products in my
goal was seven or eight now I have 12
products in my goal of seven or eight I
don't know how that one went up so much
so I'm working on moving through some
brow products they have some in my
project pans but i will say i don't feel
overwhelmed by my brow products right
now so even though I'm you know gained I
don't feel bad about that everything is
what I love except to have a backup of
like the elf powder and I don't use that
anymore so it's something I could
probably do cutter or it's like brand
name and packaging still so something
with that but I shadow singles in
February I had 40 and I didn't have a
goal and now I have 36 and I still don't
have a goal I'm glad I did too cluttered
some of the ones that I wasn't like
absolutely loving but I have some you
know room to grow I i'm not a huge
single person but if i buy a single I
want it to be beautiful and like
something that I would die over like
that's my goal like I will die over that
that single because it's so beautiful
that's Michael I probably should go back
through them and just make sure they're
all like that for eyeshadow duos I had
four in February and I was allowing
myself up to 10 and right now I just
have one and I'm
allowing myself up to 10 duos are not an
issue with me I don't get a lot of duos
so yeah for small pellets which are
anything with six shadows or less in
them in February I had 38 and my goal is
to only have 40 and now I have 47 and
Michael list only of 40 again I'm not
that upset that I'm over 40 I know a lot
of them are those maybelline eyestudio
quads i really like those and i have a
ton of limited edition ones so I'm not
really worried about that again just you
know periodically making sure I'm going
through and if I'm not loving something
getting rid of it large eyeshadow
palettes which are seven or more eye
shadows I had 49 in February with no
goal set to it and now I have 42 and i
still have no pool so I did declutter
some of those i will link that like
large eyeshadow palette down below as
well as my previous make up inventories
down below I'm really glad with the
progress on that sometimes you buy these
eyeshadow palettes and you feel guilty
to get rid of them because they're such
big items but I'm glad that I was able
to part with them because I don't even
miss him like I couldn't even tell you
what I de cluttered so yeah issues cream
eyeshadows I broke these up into two
different categories potted which were
potted in February I had 12 and my goal
is nine or 10 and now i have 10 and my
goal still nine or 10 so i hit my goal
on that which is really exciting i'm
still working on moving through a couple
i know i want to move through at least
two more by the end of this year so
we'll see how that goes for cream
eyeshadows sticks I had 13 in February
and my goal was 15 now I have 12 and my
goal is still 15 so I'm under goal I
still want to be working through those
and making sure that everything I have I
love again I'm going to say that behind
everything because that's ultimately my
goal for pigments I had 20 in February
with no goal set behind it not have 23
again with no goal set behind it and I
love all my pigments pigments are one of
those things that aren't practical
necessarily for everyday use but when
you need to get a job done they are
beautiful so I love pigments I do
glitters I had 16 in February with no
goal now I have 23 no 21 with no bowl
and
I will never have a belongs glitter
because you can never have too much
glitter liquid eye shadow I had to in
February and I goal was five and I have
to now in my goal of five the two that
they are the josie maran coconut water
eyeshadow as well as the 3ds lorac
liquid 3d drops or whatever those are
the two liquid eye shadow products if
you're wondering what they were for
mascara I had a lot of mascara and I
still have a lot of mascara because I
don't go through it very fast if I'm
only using it on myself and it lasts
longer than three months i'm still going
to use it that's just me and i don't
know when they're ever done so i
probably use them way too long or
something but i've never had a problem
anyway in February I had 19 and my goal
was to have three open and 20 total and
right now I have 20 mascaras and my goal
is to have three open or 20 total and I
do only have three open right now so I
am barely at that limit but the a lot of
them are deluxe sample size which I
forgot to mention in the beginning all
my deluxe sample sized items account as
regular makeup items in my collection
for I primers I had 11 in February and
my goal is have five open these are
something you get a lot um free and
pallets or with gift with purchase and
stuff so that's why I feel like I have
so many and right now I still have 11 of
them and again my goal is five top-five
open so no progress there I've been
using a lot of like I cream eyeshadows
as my bases and I think that's why i
haven't moving through them for pencil
eyeliner i had 43 in February and my
goals have 15 and I have 39 and my goal
is still 15 honestly with liners if
there's a really cool color or different
finish or something i'm fine with having
more than 15 I just really want to make
sure that I'm not duplicating colors and
if I really like a bronze then just have
one bronze you love unless they're
different you know like it slightly
different in color or whatever but if
it's like basically the same bronze but
one scrap your own one's nicer like why
do you have pools just stop doing that
yeah that's how I feel for gel eyeliners
I had three in February and my goal is
have one and i have to now and my goal
is to still have one i am going to be
using one up this year especially
because i use it at school and it works
really well for projects that we do so i
will get down to that pool by the end of
the year i'm pretty sure for a liquid
eyeliner i had nine in February my goal
is to have six and now I have five and
my goal is still sick so I'm under goal
there I've used up quite a few or de
cluttered some that I won't use so
that's great for glitter eye liners I
had six and now i have five which i'm
pretty sure i have six still so no both
set on those no change I'm totally fine
with that for glitter adhesive and seals
I have three and my goal is I don't have
a goal because it's just a tool to me
like I need the tools i need and i still
have three and again no goal set on that
for colored mascara i put this in its
own drawer i have I had two in February
and my goal is tap only six and i still
only have two and my goal is to still
only have six i use colored mascaras and
my brows and just as like accent accent
in details so that's why i don't want to
have too many of them at the same time
only because they'll go bad um they'll
dry up before i get to really use them
okay guys who we're doing it so for the
lips this is the last category and then
i'll go through my like total totals so
for lips for colored lipsticks in
February I had 13 my goal was to have 20
and right now for colored lipsticks I
only have one it's a blue one from lime
crime so I feel really good about that I
got rid of a lot of crappy colored
lipsticks I didn't know why I was
keeping them I did a bad like i did a
review on them and my review was like
they suck and I decided why am i keeping
them so I got rid of them for just
regular lipsticks I have I had 55 in
February I had no goal now I have 46 and
i still have no bowl so I feel good
about that that at least I'm decluttered
some that I
loving so that's great for lip crayons
this is anything in like the jumbo stick
pencil any type of stick lipstick or
like lip product I had 30 in February my
goal is to have 50 now I have 35 and my
goal is 50 these are my favorite
chocolate products they're usually like
I'm talking I'm talking about like the
NARS Matt pencils the elf pencils
anything like that I feel good about
where I'm at with that for liquid
lipsticks in February I had one and my
goal was to at 15 now I have eight which
seems kind of crazy and my goal is 15
before lip liners I had one in February
my goal is again 15 and i still only
have that one and i'm okay with having
up to 15 still let paints these are
anything like the occ lip tars or
anything like that I had four in
February and I have no goal in them and
i still only have four they're not
something that i love but if I find a
color i really like i get it for lip
glosses i had 21 in February my goal was
to only have 27 now I have 18 and my
goal is to have only 25 so I lowered my
goal and that I just don't enjoy lip
glosses they're not something that I
like so I probably don't even need that
many I could go down to 10 but we're
going to keep it there for now so for
lip balms in February I had 12 my goal
is to have five and now I have 13 I
don't know how that happened so i'm
working on those for tinted lip balms i
had 28 my goal is to have 10 now i have
19 and my goal is still 10 so i think
I've declutter Dwight a few of my tinted
lip balms probably a lot of my baby lips
and I just want to be working through
those I know a lot of them are my fresh
sugar ones that are tinted and I have a
lot of the mini sizes so I'm trying to
work through those I just don't need
them in a tinted lip balms although they
are some of my favorite lip products for
lip stains I had three in February and
my goal is to have one or two in july i
still have three but i don't need any of
them so my goal is to have zero of those
product I just don't want them for lip
treatments and scrubs I had three in
February and my goal is to have two or
three and then in july i have three
still and
I said I want up to three but really I
just need one one like lip scrub well I
guess lip treatment yeah I guess I could
have a couple like two and then last but
not least lip pallets I had one in
February my goals have one or none and I
still have that one I'm working through
it though it's at my it's in my kid at
school so whenever I need a lip product
at school I go into my lip palette to
use that so that's all like my
individual numbers now for totals in
general for the face in February I had
175 products and now currently I have a
hundred and forty-six so I did go down
in number there which is really awesome
for eyes in February I had 301 products
and now currently i have 293 so again
more progress moving down not a ton on
that one but that's still something in
February I had 174 products and for lips
and now i have a hundred and fifty one
product so again more movement down in
total in February out of my whole
collection I had 650 products and now I
only have five only I have 590 product
so i did go down 60 products in a
six-month period or so I feel really
positive about that again not all of
these were worked through but i would
say probably a good third of them i did
actually work through and use up the
rest I decluttered and I'm totally fine
either way however I decide to get rid
of them it's all about just making my
collection what I wanted to be and not
holding onto products because I feel
guilty or because I spent money on them
but only holding on to things that I
actually love that bring me joy that are
something I just the ID smile a lot when
I see my collection or that I know is
going to get a job done or it's just
amazing quality so i hope you enjoyed
this video let me know again in the
comments if you want it split up next
time in like parts or if you're fine
with one big you know long video with
all the information in it i will see you
guys
to my next video I hope you're having a
wonderful day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
