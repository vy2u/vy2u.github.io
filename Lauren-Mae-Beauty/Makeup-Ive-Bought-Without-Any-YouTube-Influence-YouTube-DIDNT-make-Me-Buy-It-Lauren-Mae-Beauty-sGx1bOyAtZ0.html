Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm gonna be doing a youtube
didn't make me buy it type of video I
originally saw this from Jessica Braun
and then since then are not Alayne if
you don't know her she did a video she
titled it a little bit differently but
it's the same premise and then Samantha
March has also done this in the past and
then redid it
so obviously I'm gonna link them all
down below definitely go check out their
videos but the whole premise of this
video is talking about items that you've
bought without the influence of YouTube
without suggestions or reviews you
picked it up because you saw it you were
interested and that's it there's nothing
else you didn't do a bunch of research
and so I thought this is a really
interesting idea when I went to go look
at my collection and look at these items
it was definitely eye-opening to me how
much stuff is either sent to me or is
something that I bought because I've
seen a review I've seen someone give it
a positive review and I want to try it
out or whatnot so these are all things
that to the best of my knowledge I did
not have any prior like knowledge of
beforehand and they're all things that I
bought with my own money so none of this
was sent it's all just makeup I
purchased because I wanted to try it so
one thing before we get into this video
I'm sorry about the noise
I'm sorry about the construction it's
irritating to me as well but hopefully
the mic that I'm getting will solve our
issues hopefully other than that let's
just get into the items and I'll explain
to you why I picked them up my thought
process and what not something I
realized is a lot of this stuff is older
like older in my collection I've had
them for a while
so the first items I want to talk about
are these Bobbi Brown blush palettes
these were limited edition so you can't
get them anymore and I'm pretty sure to
like the best of my knowledge
do a little musically I've been watching
musically lately you know as much as
people want to hate there's something
about them that is interesting to watch
that's for sure
sadly I feel like noise wise this is the
best we're gonna get for a second so
let's keep going with the blushes I
bought these online which something I've
noticed with these items is that a lot
of the things I happen to pick up on a
whim without any reviews are things that
I buy in person so I'm shopping around
and I happen to just like throw it in
the bag throw it in the bag like that
and then I buy it and try it out because
it just looked interesting something was
intriguing whereas online I feel like
I'm usually buying something that I kind
of knew I wanted it's something I've
been looking into I can even see reviews
right there and see how other people
online are enjoying it so this one I did
buy online but I don't remember any
influencers talking about this and I
honestly don't see anyone have these in
their collection when I watch collection
videos when I watch the clutter videos
there were three different colors this
one is in the pink cheeked palette I'm
pretty sure you can probably still buy
the different colors in these blushes so
if that's the case I'll leave them
linked if there's one you really enjoyed
this one is the berry cheek palette and
this one is the Calypso cheek palette
which is a lot more warm and coralie
this is probably my favorite one these
are great I really like the quality of
the blushes they're build bold yet
pigmented I feel like they blend really
nicely and I was using these in my
makeup kit for a long time I've recently
taken them out just so that I can use
them on myself because I tend to not
really use them on people in my kit so
they're kind of just like being brought
around with me and never being used so I
thought I would take them out and at
least use them on myself for a little
bit this is a purchase that I definitely
wouldn't in made today in the sense that
I wouldn't bought all three of them I
probably would have just bought one of
the palettes but this was back in the
day I was at the beginning of my panning
journey and trying to downsize and not
buy as much and somehow I ended up with
three of these $45 palettes but
ultimately without hearing any reviews
on these products I am really happy with
them another cheek product this is
something I talked about a lot at the
beginning on my channel because I got it
right when I had moved here we went to
friends beauty me and my class and I saw
this on the
section I paid $10 for it it's a blush
by Terina tarantino and it's in the
shade Neapolitan Lane
it's a beautiful shade it's very similar
to like a tart exposed type of color a
nudie
blush and I love it so so much I've
never heard anyone talk about this blush
at all I just picked it up because it
was on sale I actually picked up another
blush at the same time but I have since
too cluttered that one because I always
reach for this one this is beautiful I'm
sad that it's just continued I feel like
half of the things in my collection or
discontinued I do love limited edition
items in the sense that I like when new
collections come out and picking up
things that I'll enjoy but I totally
understand how it can be disappointing
as an audience member to not be able to
get these limited edition items when I'm
talking about how awesome they are this
one wasn't limited edition actually I
think it was just just continued but I
really love this this was a great
purchase and just like on a whim buy but
again I mean those two purchases have
something in common I would love just
one of those items but I always go in
excess I'm always like oh I'm gonna get
seven of them I'm gonna get two of them
I'm gonna get three of them you know and
I could just get the one and be
satisfied that's something that I feel
like I've gotten better at but it's
definitely a good thing to keep in check
with this kind of look at my collection
the last kind of like cheek type of item
or face color item this is the Laura
Geller sunset glow baked color and
contour which has a bronzer highlight
and blush in it I picked this up off the
Laura Geller website I did a huge laura
geller haul I'm gonna leave that link
down below if you wanna check it out
this is really beautiful it's like this
huge disc I got this hoping I could use
it in my kit and honestly it's not
something I really use much although I
definitely could use this product it's
glowy the bronzer in here is definitely
like more of a shimmery glowy bronzer
but I just never reached for it so again
I took it out of my kit and just use it
for myself
I love the highlighter in here I believe
this is the french vanilla highlighter
so that is something I've used up a
full-size of and then the blush I love
laura geller blushes and then and the
bronzer it's nice it's fine I can make
it work adds color but it's not my
favorite because it isn't like more of a
satin it is more glowy than a satin
overall I hadn't heard anyone talk about
the specific contour or
blush palette I just saw it on the
website I had a discount on it and I
think it might have been on sale so I
thought why not try a bunch of products
and one I thought it would be nice to
like be compact that they're all
together if I could go back in time I
don't know if I'd make this purchase I
think if you're someone who's really
simple and likes to carry minimal
products in their makeup bag this might
work for you since it's everything
all-in-one but I still don't suggest
necessarily having only a bronzer this
glowy in your collection so I think the
products are nice it's just not
something I get a ton of use out of
every single day so I could definitely
love about it but I still think the
quality of this product is good I have
one foundation in here and that is it
the only other one I could think of that
I don't have any longer because I was
only picking items that I still
currently have in my collection there
are a few that came to mind of things
that I've decluttered in the past but I
wanted to keep it to things that
actually have anyway the one I was going
to tell you is the one from Rimmel it's
like the Rimmel matte BB cream I love
that thing I remember using it so so
much in Arizona I went through tubes and
tubes of that it was like my Holy Grail
but this foundation is from number 7
this is the beautifully matte foundation
and I have it in the shade cool vanilla
the lightest shade I believe is the
shade calico which I also have that one
and I tend to mix them I really love
this foundation if you want something
that's more like medium-full coverage
definitely a matte finish it's gonna
stay all day this is really really nice
I found in Arizona this lasted me a lot
better my skin wasn't as oily there it
was definitely a lot more dry even
though I considered it oily then moving
to California I realized how non oily my
skin really was there every time we go
back I'm like oh my gosh my skin is
drying out so I do really like this this
isn't my normal foundation anymore
I like to use this as a mixer if I have
a foundation that's too yellow because
these shades tend to run more neutral or
kind of like grayish but yeah I really
do like this foundation if that matte
more coverage kind of look is what you
want this is a really good one it's a
bit expensive from the drugstore but I
think I've purchased three of them
overall so I do really like it I have a
contour stick here
from the brand Jordana this is something
I'm pretty sure I didn't see anything
like anyone talk about this but I really
like this I still don't hear really
anyone talk about it and I don't even
use it as much as I should but this is
really really pretty for a cream contour
that isn't warm you guys know I love my
milk bronzer stick in the shade baked I
loved it so much but that gives you like
this really beautiful warmth to the skin
and if you're looking for something more
of a contour to chisel out and to add
some shadow to your face this one's
beautiful this is in the shade light but
I believe it comes in three different
colors this blends out really nicely and
I don't feel like it's hard to blend out
I know a lot of people are really
intimidated by cream contouring and just
contouring in general which I kind of
want to do a video about maybe but like
it blends out so nicely so you're not
gonna like go overboard with this I'm
pretty sure this retails for like $2.99
so it was a great Buy I definitely think
that I tend to buy more inexpensive or
drugstore items on a whim that I do more
expensive items because it's you know
less of a risk but this was a really
good one I really enjoy it now that
whole story about me not buying things
that are expensive on a whim that's not
true for this these are from Laura
Mercier and these are some pigments I
picked these up I was with Sam sister
Gwen we were shopping around is right
before the holidays it was when we were
still living in Arizona so I mean my
mindset was definitely like buy
everything yeah I want I want everything
but I saw these and I just couldn't say
no I'm not sure if they even make these
anymore but this is in the shade crushed
lapis and this one is in the shade a
crushed amethyst I'll give you guys
swatches the applicator on these is kind
of interesting like it's not normal of
like a pigment for it to be like this
I definitely don't love that about it
but these both have like a really slight
duochrome to them they're really
beautiful I should do some type of look
or tutorial with these so those are some
swatches of them ooh that one has like a
gold shift overall they're super
beautiful they're not something I reach
for a lot and I know that these were
probably at least like 20-something
apiece so it like breaks my little heart
I would not have purchased these today
knowing how much I use loose pigments as
much as they're beautiful I just tend to
not use them and I have so many
eyeshadows in my collection but these
are beautiful but they were definitely
something that ooh pretty shiny I saw
them on the shelf and then was like
throw em in the bag I have two different
eyeliners to talk about the first one
here is from Wet n Wild and I picked
this up because I had run out of my
all-time favorite white eyeliner that I
use on my lash line or my waterline from
Stila it was discontinued and it makes
me so sad because literally it was
perfect so pigmented so creamy I felt
like it stayed in my waterline for a
really long time and it lasted me
forever anyway I thought I would like
try to use this instead this is the
shade yin and yang and I think I ordered
it online or maybe I bought it in store
I don't know it looks pigmented enough
from the swatch but it has like a pearly
Sheen to it which just you know isn't my
favorite I want something that's just
like a cream finish and I just don't
love it so this is something I just
picked up didn't look at reviews I was
just like this is inexpensive let's see
how it compares not that good not the
worst but not very good similarly this
eyeliner I picked up right when I went
home for Christmas break this year I
went on this kind of like fun shopping
spree my grandma giving me Christmas
money and I was like you know what I'm
gonna go to Walgreens and shop around
because I honestly I'm such an online
shopper I tend to just always make
online purchases if I'm gonna buy makeup
and so it's kind of fun to just walk the
drugstore look at what's in and I tend
to not even go to the drugstore very
much I don't go to Walgreens or CVS or
Target or any of the stores very often
there aren't even Walmart's near me so
it was like this fun thing and I saw
this from Rimmel this is the Wonder
ombre holographic effect eyeliner I have
it in the shade of purple prism and the
whole like gimmick of this is that one
side is supposed to be like a darker
color and the other side is like this
transformative color and you're supposed
to be able to get essentially like three
different looks or like create an ombre
liner look and that's just not the case
y'all I don't really like this product
it's definitely a disappearo
meant to me those are the swatches of
the two sides and then I'm gonna put
some of this over the purple these tend
to just not really dry down very well so
it's like you can't really I don't even
know if you can tell the difference yeah
you can just just lame like not enough
of a difference really tell on eyeball I
mean stupid I was hoping this would be
great I really like the Rimmel eyeliners
and this was definitely disappointing I
should've looked at reviews for that one
alright and last on my list here and
have some lip products oddly enough
these all happen to be from Revlon so I
must have a thing for wrestling lip
products the first one here is the
Revlon kiss plumping lip cream I picked
this up on that same trip with the
Rimmel eyeliner and I really love this
product this is the shade barely blush
and I really like these products I know
that Samantha March does not like these
so I feel like we kind of have a
different idea of what we like for lip
product so if you're more her you won't
like this and if you more are me you
probably will maybe but this is
something I hadn't seen reviews on I
just like the shape of it and how skinny
it was and I liked this color so I was
like I'm gonna go for it and I've really
been enjoying it one of my favorites
same with this one this is something I
basically did that same trip but the
year before when I went back to Arizona
for this one this is in the shade HD
dawn and it's the Revlon HD gel lip
color or something like that it's just
so beautiful it's like a sheer easy to
use pretty lipstick has a very like
tropically type of scent love that and
last is another product that i just
walked in this wasn't in Arizona but I
walked in and saw that they had lip
balms in these like stick form and I was
like what are those and these are the
Revlon kiss I love that line these are
the Revlon kiss balms I have juicy peach
here I've already used up the coconut
one which I did find so I'll show you
that in my empties I used it all the way
up
I have juicy peach and I had the apple
one but I have since passed that on
because it had like this really slight
red tint to it that I tended to never
want
we're but I love these I think these are
amazing what I bought them they were
expensive they were like eight something
a piece but on the Ulta website they're
like $4.99 a piece now so I'm glad the
price dropped I don't know if that's
just the CVS where I live or what's
going on with that I wish I hadn't paid
that much but I'm glad to know that they
are less expensive on altas website
I love the tropical coconut one that's
my absolute favorite one it smells
amazing it's not too sweet on the lips
these give you a nice hydration and feel
like just nice on the lip without being
too glossy or too greasy they aren't
going to like bring your lips back from
the dead but they definitely give you
some hydrating properties highly suggest
them very very good and they have SPF 20
in them so yeah okay guys so those are
all of the items that YouTube didn't
make me buy I would say overall I did a
pretty good job I think that definitely
now I'm learning what I like and I'm
trying not to be swayed by just
packaging instead it's by like hey I
know I like really lightweight lip
colors and I like them in nudes and I
like you know something that's more
sheer so when I find something that fits
that and is intriguing even if I haven't
heard a review there's just a higher
chance of me liking that product whereas
when I go gimmicky like that Rimmel
eyeliner disaster strikes anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed the video if you liked
this idea definitely go check out the
other ladies I mentioned other than that
thank you guys so so much for watching
and I will see you in the next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
