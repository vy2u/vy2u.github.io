someone outside the moment I try to film
I am filming today from my new apartment
so I think this is gonna be the setup I
hope you guys like it
I am literally like sweating right now
because I took forever to figure out
where to put my lights in the camera and
where I'm gonna film and stuff so let me
know if you guys like this background I
might try a couple other things or it
might not be the exact angle every time
I have to put like marks on the floor of
where my stuff needs to be set up so it
can be like easier for me to set up but
anyway this video is actually going to
be all the makeup products I've used up
for the year so far
I thought it'd be fun I know a lot of
people are collecting their makeup that
they use up to show in like kind of a
year-end finale video but I thought it'd
be cool to kind of show just a halfway
point where I'm at what I've used up and
kind of what my goals are of what other
makeup I want to use up or like how many
items so a lot of this stuff I mean you
should have already seen it in different
projects so if you've seen those I don't
know I thought it'd be cool I guess to
put it in one big video for you guys to
see the makeup that I've used up so far
in 2015 so let's just get into it
I'm going to actually try to be
organized about this video so we're
gonna start with primers I've used up
two primers this year this one is
benefits Porefessional I love this
primer it's really great it's probably
one of my favorite ones I've ever used
it doesn't keep me um matte though
that's the only thing I don't like about
it but it's great I love the way it
feels on the skin it smells really nice
and this was like the jumbo size like
massive so I did use this up in about
like half a year it's gonna use this up
it's probably on the top of my list to
purchase once I finish up a lot of my
primers I have also finished up the baby
skin primer by Maybelline this was in my
products I want to use up by the end of
the year so I already have one of those
down so happy I did start enjoying this
primer as I used it it's very silicone
II though but not like the benefit one
it just feels more slippery and like
almost greasy although it doesn't make
your skin look you see it looks matte
but it feels greasy hopefully I don't
know if you guys have used this let me
know if you think that down below but it
is a good one especially at the
drugstore price I think it's all like
$5.99 or $6.99 up some of my other
primers but I'm not going to go buy it
right now I have two liquid foundations
this one is from covergirl oh it's in
the wrong way
this one's from covergirl it's the
nature luxe foundation in the color 310
they discontinued I believe this line
and I did like this foundation it was
okay it's not something that I'm like
upset that thing just continued though
it was just something I was trying to
work through so this one's done if you
guys hear construction I apologize but
there's construction on like the
building over from us so that's just
gonna be my videos from now on I
apologize but there is absolutely
nothing I can do at all trust me every
morning at 7:00 like clockwork they
start up even Saturdays so hey this is
the other foundation I've used up this
is the Big Easy by benefit it's just a
small deluxe sized sample this was in
the shade number three I actually really
liked this BB cream I wasn't I thought
there was a lot of hype around jet and I
wasn't you know excited to try but I got
this little sample and I would consider
repurchasing this one as well so that's
like pretty good frail to make a
products I've said so far like a lot of
women repurchases I like that so far
I've used up one concealer this is the
cover girl in LA bomb concealer
concealer bomb it's in the stick form
though not the pot it's all used up I
didn't like clean out the middle though
I don't know this was an OK concealer
for me it is kind of creamy front of the
eyes if you have dryness it might be
good but I just I had issues with this
I'm glad it's gone I wouldn't repurchase
it so that one is done I finished up two
powders this one is just my gosh every
single time they're the wrong way um I
finished this one up by Target this one
was just a sample sized one in the
Amazonian clay Provocateur pressed
mineral powder this was in light for it
took me forever to use this up it was
okay it was a little dark for me so I
wouldn't repurchase this I just was glad
to get it out of my collection and
and this one doesn't have like anything
on it but this is the ultra flush I
believe whoa oh that's great I believe
this is the it's called the ultra flash
pressed powder I don't really know I got
this off of all cosmetics wholesale I
did use it twice like I bought it and
then I repurchase it and this is the
second one I've used up it's really nice
it's a very creamy powder it just has
that really nice texture to it so it was
great and it go on really nice but I did
find that throughout the day it made me
really because I have oily skin so
that's the thing I didn't like about it
so I probably wouldn't like repurchase
or try to find it I don't even know if
you can it's not on the website anymore
so those two are you stuff as well this
is actually another foundation on used
stuff this is the bare minerals original
foundation in the color fairly light
it's just a small little size use this
up this is an okay foundation the
original version does leave you kind of
glowy so it's something I would use like
if I'm not trying to have like a full
coverage face and I'm just gonna be out
a couple of hours I think it's nice and
can get you out the door really fast but
um it's something I would just like to
have in my collection but I would I
think I would be looking for something
that could replace it potentially I
guess you know like I'm satisfied but I
think that could be better out there you
know that whole well what if there's
something better so I'll buy a million
things to try to see that's how this is
for me I have two eyebrow pencils this
one is the Maybelline definer brow in
the color blonde oh no in the color dark
blonde I really liked this pencil
actually these two are really similar
this is the clinic when I've used up it
has the same exact function like they're
the exact same packaging I don't know if
you can see that they're the exact same
packaging exact same size I liked the
color of the Maybelline one better too
so these are only like five dollars it's
like sixteen dollars so I wouldn't
repurchase the Clinique one at all I
didn't really like the color either but
the Maybelline one I would consider
although I have been enjoying my Jordana
fabula inner and also my Anasazi ones so
but if I was like feeling cheap but
wanted a thinner
pencil I would go with this one I
actually have another primer to base oh
I'm so not organized
this primer is from hourglass this is
the mineral veil primer that was so hard
to say I don't really get the hyper on
this product I don't think it's that
great I have one more little size like
this but I would not repurchase this at
all I just I don't know it just doesn't
do anything for me I know a lot of
people love it but I'm kind of glad I
don't because it's really Simpson oh my
gosh it's so unorganized the minute I am
organized I also have another brow
pencil this is a Nastasia brow is in the
color taupe I believe dark brown oh no
dark brown because I got this in a
Sephora kit from my brother and my mom
for Christmas I didn't get to pick the
color so I was using dark brown I used
it up it was nice um I like the darker
brow as you can tell my brows probably
like really dark gene because I did get
my hair dyed when my mom was in town so
um yeah she dyed my hair for me so I
love this pencil it's really great it is
a harder formula and I just love the
spoolie it's just great it's something I
probably will have in my collection
always um but I am trying to try out
different things to see if I like it I
want to try out the next one but I do
love these they are great I have one now
I've used up three mascaras they're all
just tiny sizes
this was the Josie Maran black oil I
thought this was okay it felt nice but
it kind of flaked at the end so I didn't
like that I wouldn't pay the money for
it I guess is biggest thing if I got
another sample I'd use it but I wouldn't
pay the money this Laura keller one was
not my favorite at all something about
this brush made me seriously hit my
lashes and like my under eyelid every
time i used it it was like metal pokey
and horrible i didn't think it did
anything amazing for my lashes too so
just the fact that i was constantly like
badgering my eye with it i didn't enjoy
it all and then this is the Too Faced
better than sex I actually really liked
this and I was really turned off because
of the name of it I thought like they're
just being like outrageous to be
outrageous and
Oh boom but I really love this mascara
it works really well it gives you volume
it gives you this like really volume
eyes like thick look without being super
clumpy but it's a little comfy but
clumpy in a good way
that sounds bad it's not clumpy but it
just gives you those really full lashes
I really like it it's like a more dry
formula it's good I would probably not
repurchase but I would love to get
little samples like this this video is
an absolute mess because I have another
concealer sorry guys I suck this is the
benefit fake up concealer this was just
a deluxe a sample I did not like this
concealer it's very it has like the ring
around it that's like a bomb and then
inside is the actual pigmented concealer
maybe if you had dry like really dry
under eyes again this might work for you
I just didn't enjoy it I like Jo pad
applicator or like the brush on type of
highlighters those are usually my
favorite so I would not go with this
again liners I actually only have three
liners in here this one's a Tarte
colored clay it's just in black I had
this in one of my projects I used it up
I used it to tightline that's what I use
all my black liners for because I use
liquid liner on the top if I do a cat
wing like today but other than that I
don't really need a black liner on the
top like in a pencil form so I just
tight line and that's I'm gonna get
through all my liners so we're gonna be
here for years this one's a buxom one
it's also in black it's called like
black julep or black Jasper it's in
black Jasper just a block size mini I
got this in like a liner kit from
Sephora a long time ago but it's used up
and gone and then this is my Stila
liner and Oscar fish it was like a brown
bronze color with a little bit of
sparkle in it I use this on my bottom
lash line and I was like smudge it out
with my finger that's how I like to use
my pencil liners I don't like a harsh
line I'd rather smudge or use like you
know again the tight line but I can't
tighten with these because it gets like
film on my eyes I don't like that so I
use this one up though all of those I
would
necessarily repurchase I'm still looking
for that perfect block liner that
doesn't budge on the upper lash line so
once I find that that'll be my Holy
Grail
that'll be all I use and then I might
have some like colored ones for fun
but it may be some brown ones but I just
don't need multiples of colors I don't
I have only lip balms left or lip
products left and I have a perfume
rollerball so this is the Korres jasmine
lip balm I really like this I have
another one it's all used up though I
have another one of this I love the
smell the tint it gets to my lips is
really pretty and I just wish it wasn't
in a pot but I don't really like the
glazed form of this product either so
I'm just kind of you know screwed when
it comes to that but I use this by my
bed and I love it I think it's great I
would repurchase once I get through all
my other Korres lip butters because I
have a lot of them this is my Dior creme
de Rose lip balm I bought this because
you know everyone loved it it's okay I
think the packaging is the best part
about this it's beautiful it looks so
nice like it would look so nice on a
vanity but I wouldn't repurchase this I
didn't think it was amazing yeah it was
okay but not for the price for me I love
the sugar ones those are my favorite the
fresh sugar lip balms speaking of fresh
sugar lip balms I have this one in the
color Rosie
I like this color I would consider
getting this one in the big one I just
don't like the small versions of these
because the product just gets really
messy by the end of it the product is so
soft that in the small versions if you
like put it in your pocket or if you
it's slightly warm these get really soft
and kind of goopy and they break off the
base but I don't think that's that isn't
the case with the one I've had in the
full-size it doesn't do that so I think
it's just how tiny these are they can't
withstand you actually using them so I
would not probably repurchase the small
ones again I probably just test them out
I'm just
instead of getting like seven small ones
I would just go for one big one in a
color I like this is a baby lip so
they've used up this is in the color
twinkle just twinkle and I
any of this left when I moved out here
so I just finished it up in a project
it's gone Baby Lips I'm making a pact to
myself that I'm not gonna buy anymore
they're super cute but I don't find that
they moisturize my lips I won't
repurchase this is a maybelline color
whisper this is in the color
one-size-fits pearl I thought this was a
pretty color every time I wore this my
one of my friends would always ask like
what's on your lips so I mean I must
have looked good on me I thought it
smelt like fruity pebbles and I don't
know I don't know if I would repurchase
it it's just I'd rather just have the
fresh ones only like I don't need all
this other crap I just want the fresh
one maybe I'm trying out another lip
balm and then that's it for attempted I
don't know it's nice if you want to try
it out I think it's a good product but I
don't know if I dread purchase and then
the last thing I know this isn't makeup
it's a rollerball perfume but I am
including these in my like stash of used
up makeup products this is the Viva La
Juicy rollerball I use this up in a
project I do like the smell of this I
like the LeFleur scent better yeah it's
very sweet it's nice it is a nice scent
I usually got compliments on it and it
does stay on my skin all day I would
consider a repurchasing this but I do
have like half of all the little fuller
one so I probably will just stick with
that one it's nice so I'm glad it's you
stuff and I got my money's worth
and that is everything I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
hopefully the angle is okay I know I
keep looking over here it's gonna be a
little different but we will make it
work and we'll see I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day well see in the
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
