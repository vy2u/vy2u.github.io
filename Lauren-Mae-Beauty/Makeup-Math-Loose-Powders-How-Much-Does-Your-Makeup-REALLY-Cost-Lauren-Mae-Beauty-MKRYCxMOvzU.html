learn thank you so much for watching
today we're doing a new series I feel
like I have a new series every freaking
day but this is going to be called
makeup math and this is gonna be all
about breaking down products and
categories figuring out how much you're
really paying for them and just kind of
doing some yeah makeup math I'm just and
grants and prices and yeah it's a lot so
janae is gonna be all about loose
powders I went through sephora's website
it went through altas website I wrote
down all of the high-end products and
the drugstore products that they sell as
well as added a few other ones that
weren't on those websites and so what I
did is I took those products I broke
them down for price per gram and got
their value so we're gonna go buy most
expensive least expensive most product
least products and then the best value
and the worst value so it's just a
different way of looking at makeup I am
more in the camp of it doesn't matter
how much product you get because I'm
more about having more variety in my
collection I would rather have a smaller
eye shadow than getting a huge one like
Natasha Genoa and pay more for it but
it's a better value per gram than a lot
of other eyeshadows to me I have a large
collection there's no way I'm gonna be
using up what that value is so it
doesn't matter I'm still spending X
amount of dollars for that eyeshadow if
that makes sense but I will say going
through these powders and going through
the math of it all was definitely
eye-opening some of these it's it's very
interesting how much you're actually
getting and how much this product
actually is like what how much is this
actual product when you compare it to
other products on the market and I do
think that loose powders or something
you're gonna use every single day like a
face product is definitely more
important to get a better bang for your
buck than something like a color
cosmetic that you might not be using
every day but I'm gonna stop talking
about it we're gonna get into it if I
did any of my math wrong forgive me I
like makeup and I don't always love math
the only reason this works is because
it's makeup masks so I'm gonna start off
with the absolute most expensive
products in the categories of high-end
and drugstore so this is just how much
it would cost if you went and bought it
at the store these are the top products
I think we all probably guess what the
highest one was and this is from lemare
it's the powder which cost $95 4.28
ounces of product when I come
to the drugstore I have a couple of
products mentioned here the first one
and the most expensive that I found is
from Vichy and this is the derma finish
setting powder it retails for $21 for
one ounce of product so you can already
see the difference there between the
lemare one and the Vichy one although
this is $21 you're getting a full ounce
or as you're only getting a little over
a quarter of an ounce in the limiter
powder oh man this is just like an
eye-opening series let me tell you for
the Vichy powder though I don't know if
that really counts as drugstore or not
like I know you can buy it at places
like drugstores but I decided to bring
up a more traditional drugstore brand as
well in this category which are the
physician formula mineral aware powders
they have like two different kinds but
both of them retail for $13.99 each and
one of them has point three five ounces
in it and one of them has point four
nine ounces in it so those are the most
expensive powders that you can get in
those categories out of the ones that I
looked at and just let you guys know I
looked at 28 drugstore powders and I
looked at 45 high-end powders so it was
a lot of different calculations going
into this and a lot of different
products to test against each other the
next category is the least expensive
this is talking about a product at the
store what's the least amount of money
you could pay and get a full product so
for high-end that would be the Sephora
collection beauty amplified powder this
retails for $16 for 0.28 ounces
Friedrichs are the cheapest powder that
I could find that you could buy a full
powder in is the CYO fixing powder all
set which is five dollars for 0.5 two
ounces of product now before we get into
the worst values and the best values
which i think is the most interesting I
want to talk about which products you
get the most in and which products you
get the least amount of product in so
this has nothing to do with price it's
just about how many ounces of product
are actually in that so when it comes to
high-end products the most product out
of everything that I looked at was from
the Too Faced peach matte setting powder
this retails for $32 but it has one
point to three ounces in it and that is
by far a ton more product than a lot of
what we're gonna see you will see in a
moment
and then for a drugstore it was tied
between the been nine neutral set and
the RCM a no color powder the been nine
retails for $11 an hour CMA one also has
three ounces but it retails for $12 so
both of those I know are not like found
at Walgreens or CVS but I feel like they
are talked about enough in the YouTube
sphere for me to count them as like
low-end powders when it comes to the
least amount of product and these lens I
feel like they're just ripping you off
baby they try to rip you off so for
high-end products the products you can
buy out of all these powders with the
least amount of actual product to use in
it for high-end it's Kevin a Kwanza
gossamer loose setting powder this
retails for $72 and you get point one
one ounces in it now if you thought the
lemare didn't have any product in it
this one has less than half of that
amount of product in it for $72 it's
insane and I wish I could say that the
drugstore was giving you better deals
but L'Oreal infallible Pro sweep and
lock powder retails for $9.99 and it
only has 0.1 ounces of powder in it that
is so little when other brands are
giving you a full ounce it's crazy I did
want to give like an honorable mention
to the models own grand finale loose
powder this retails for $12.99 and has
0.18 ounces in it which is still it's
just a very very small amount of product
and the price point is still pretty high
especially for drugstore so I think that
finally brings us to talk about some
price per gram I'm gonna bring you the
top 5 in each category when it comes to
high end and drugstore and the best
value and the worst value it was
definitely shocking to see these numbers
and it was kind of surprising when you
got down to it and you you know divided
out the price per gram that some of
these really high-end brands you could
get for cheaper than drugstore brands
even so anyway let's get into it the
worst value high end number one spot
goes to Kevin a Quan I don't think that
was any surprise like I mentioned the
gossamer loose setting powder retails
for $72 4.11 ounces of product which
comes out to 654 dollars and 55 cents
per ounce of product that is insane
if you wanted the same amount of
in the vichy setting powder that we've
already talked about you would have to
spend six hundred and fifty five dollars
to get that same amount of product in
the Kevyn Aucoin formula I get that
formulas are different cost if things
are different but some of this is like
crazy ridiculous coming in at number two
is the Clinique fit post-workout
neutralizing powder this retails for $29
but oh my gosh this is even less I
thought that the L'Oreal one was the
worst but this one actually is the worst
so it's $29 four point zero eight ounces
of product so that equals out to three
hundred and sixty two dollars and fifty
cents per ounce of product and this was
really surprising because you will see
you later on the Clinique actually holds
a spot for one of the best values you
getting the most product for the least
amount of money when it comes to
high-end so for them to also have
something that is the most expensive for
high-end I thought was very interesting
number three is lemare's the powder
which is $95 for 0.28 ounces which
equals three hundred and thirty nine
dollars and twenty nine cents per ounce
number four for high-end and the worst
value is the super goop invincible
setting powder SPF 45 now this product
is a little bit different because it is
a container that has like a brush on it
so it's kind of like a whole contraption
it's not just a regular loose powder and
then you can buy refills after you've
bought the product initially which does
save you some money but for the initial
product purchase it's thirty dollars
four points zero nine ounces of product
and that equals three hundred and thirty
three dollars and 33 cents per ounce
that's how much you'd have to pay to
have an ounce of that product the refill
retails for fourteen dollars four point
zero nine ounces still the same amount
of product but since that price is
dropped down so much it's only it's only
a hundred and fifty five dollars and
fifty six cents per ounce and ringing in
at number five for the worst value and
high-end products is the black up
anti-shine loose powder it retails for
$32 but it has only point sixteen ounces
of product so you would need to spend
$200 to get a full ounce of that product
crazy right I mean Kevin iguana takes
the cake with how expensive his product
is I cannot believe it like I had
look at it a million times on the
website like wait wait wait what like
there's no way six over six hundred
dollars it costs to get an ounce of that
product when you can buy the two-faced
one where you get over an ounce of
product in it for like thirty dollars
it's crazy
let's go into drugstore and talk about
the worst value for director so the
number one worst value you guessed it is
that L'Oreal won the L'Oreal infallible
Pro sweep and lock powder is $9.99 for
0.1 ounces of product so you need to
spend essentially $100 to get one ounce
of that product I will say at least the
highest in the drugstore is still only
half as bad as the fifth worst in the
high-end product so that's a positive I
guess I don't know coming in at number
two is the Neutrogena mineral sheers
loose powder this is $13.99 but it has
point one nine ounces in it so do buy a
full ounce of that product it would be
seventy three dollars and 63 cents
definitely better but this one I believe
is a more like powder foundation type of
product so I do think you would be using
more of this product and there's no what
you were just going through it so fast
for such a high price and such a little
amount of product number three worst
value from the drugstore is the models
own grand finale loose powder this is
$12.99 four point one eight ounces of
products you need to spend seventy two
dollars and seventeen cents to get an
ounce of that product number four is
from NYX this is the NYX color
correcting powder which retails for
$9.99 4.21 ounces of product and that
equals forty seven dollars and fifty
seven cents per ounce so we're
definitely getting down there now
finally and the fifth worst value at the
drugstore is the maybelline face studio
master fix powder it retails for $8.99
but you're only getting 0.21 ounces of
product which makes it 42 dollars and 81
cents an ounce something that I think is
so interesting is how a product when you
look at it initially if you see
something for $13.99 you might think
like oh my gosh it's so expensive but
the amount of product in a less
expensive item might make it a worse
value for you to buy even though you
might be spending more upfront when it
comes down to how long that product is
gonna last you if it is something you
use every single day you
getting away better value spending more
money up front to get more product so
let's talk about the best value what's
what are the good deals we can find
what's the positive of doing this makeup
math so high-end the number one best
value that you can get is from Clinique
and it's the blended face powder and it
comes with a brush so that's an added
value it retails for $26 and you get one
point two ounces of product in it so
that makes the price per ounce go down
to 2167 which is very good for the
high-end products let me remind you that
that kevin of kwan-yuen was six hundred
and fifty five dollars coming in at
number two is the two-faced peach matte
setting powder it retails for thirty two
dollars but you do get one point two
three ounces of product so even though
it's more expensive than the Clinique
because you're still getting that high
amount of product it's a great value if
you were to buy an ounce of that product
it would be twenty six dollars and two
cents coming in at number three is the
dermablend loose setting powder this
retails for twenty seven dollars and you
get a full ounce in that product so
twenty seven dollars buys you an ounce
number four is from cinema secrets this
is the ultra Lucent setting powder it
retails for twenty two dollars and it
has point six seven ounces of product in
it so it cost thirty two dollars and 84
cents per ounce and then number five and
this makes me so excited that this is in
the top five of the best value is the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
this retails for thirty eight dollars
but you are getting an entire ounce in
that product so that makes the price per
ounce thirty eight dollars and that is a
highly raved about powder on the market
in the youtube community in the makeup
community and it's exciting to see that
today's an actual great value i'm so
happy that they put an entire ounce in
that product because it is something
that you can use up a lot and it is an
investment so at least it's going to
last you a bit of time alright so for
the last portion of the best value we're
talking about the drugstore items and
these are going to be the best of the
best values because they already were
less expensive than the high-end
products coming in at number one is the
Coty airspun loose powder this retails
for 729 and it has 2.3 ounces of product
in it making the price per ounce go down
to three dollars and seventeen cents
this is also a very raved about powder
here on YouTube and it's gray
to know that it's such an amazing value
number two is from Ben Nye and this is
the neutral set I chose to put the three
ounce bottle in here but you can buy
this in various sizes or the three ounce
bottle it costs eleven dollars and that
makes the price per ounce
three dollars and 67 cents the RCM a no
color powder comes in at number three
and this is $12 for three ounces of
product which makes the price per ounce
four dollars even number four on the
list for best value is the J cap beauty
Lux Pro powder this is $6.99 for 1.5
ounces of powder which is amazing that
makes the price per ounce on that
product four dollars and sixty six cents
and then bringing up the end of the list
number five is for makeup revolution and
this is the luxury banana powder it
retails for eight dollars it also has
1.5 ounces of product in it and the
price per ounce comes to five dollars
and 33 cents I will say the Ben Nye VJ
Kat and the makeup revolution all of
those can come in that 1.5 like kind of
weird bottle so it's great that you can
get so much product in that bottle if
you see anything in that bottle it's
probably a pretty good deal if it's at a
reasonable price I know I'm throwing
like a ton of numbers at you I asked you
guys in a video and you guys said that
you would want to see this that you want
me to get geeky with the makeup so I
mean we went there I do want to talk
about some interesting things here at
the end that I noticed as I was
comparing all of these numbers in these
products and all this stuff the number
one thing that was very interesting to
me was that some brands have very
similar products like they have a couple
different loose powders but their
pricing and sizing is different which I
thought was really interesting some of
them are the same I would say a lot of
them are but I always thought it was
interesting when it was the same brand
and it wasn't the same amount of product
and it wasn't the same price some
examples of that the laura mercier
translucent setting powder we talked
about that already
it's $38 for a full ounce of product
which makes it $38 per ounce whereas
their mineral illuminating powder is $36
but you only get point three four ounces
so about a third of the products you get
in the translucent setting powder and
that makes the price go up significantly
when it comes to price per ounce so the
price per ounce on that is a hundred and
five dollars and eighty eight cents so
definitely a huge difference I'm a
that the mineral illuminating powder has
a bunch of different shades and maybe
that's part of why it costs more but I
definitely thought that was interesting
the difference between those two clinics
we've already seen that I mean it had
one in the absolute worst value the
Clinique fit post-workout neutralizing
powder $29 four point zero eight ounces
that is the item with the absolute least
amount of product on this whole list and
so that makes the price per ounce I mean
massive it's three hundred and sixty-two
dollars per ounce whereas their blended
face powder with the brush is $26 you
get one point two ounces and it's the
literal best value out of all the
high-end powders that I looked at for
this video so that was very interesting
makeup forever had a similar situation
Maybelline had very similar situations
and so did Physicians Formula so I will
leave all of this information in the
downbar I'm also going to be like
putting it you know up on the screen as
much as I can because I'm sure we're all
the the mean right now where it's like
we're figuring out math I know I am and
then the final thing that I thought was
interesting is that I feel like
packaging that has built-in brushes in
it so the super group there were some
physician's formulas and also the
Clinique one which is the worst value I
feel like they tend to have the lowest
amount of product for the highest cost
and I don't know if that's just part of
how the contraption is made to use the
product or it just keeps it not as bulky
because it's not as much product
attached to the brush but I do think
that staying away from those products is
going to save you more money because
they tend to just have very little
product in it and I think that they can
kind of afford to charge a higher price
because you are getting the brush and
it's more of a complete item but when it
comes to the amount of product and how
long that's gonna last you it's I mean
there just isn't enough product in there
to really justify it unless you have
specific reasons for wanting it so I
hope this was not a boring video for you
guys I know that it was a lot of numbers
and a lot of comparing products and
everything and I don't have them here to
show you but I definitely think this is
a very very interesting thing to look at
I do want to mention really fast here at
the end there is a video that I watched
from a channel I'm gonna leave her
channel down below I cannot remember it
for the life of me at the moment she
mentioned in one of my
that she had broken-down products and
we'll kind of talked about this topic so
if you want more on this topic I'm gonna
leave her video down below so you can
check it out and kind of delve into it a
little bit deeper but I think this is
gonna be a super fun series on this
channel I would love you guys leave a
comment letting me know you want to see
me compare next in this series and I
would just love to know your overall
thoughts on this because when you really
break down the math of how much you're
getting and how much it's worth
depending on what products it is and
what you are wanting with your
collection I think you can just help you
make better decisions do you want to
splurge on the powder is that powder
worth the price tag or is it not do you
like something that's very very similar
in formula but one is just so much more
cost-effective I think just breaking
down and looking at makeup in different
ways it's just so fun and interesting
and can just give you more insight into
how you can make your collection best
work for you and your finances so I hope
you guys enjoyed thank you so so much
for watching and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
