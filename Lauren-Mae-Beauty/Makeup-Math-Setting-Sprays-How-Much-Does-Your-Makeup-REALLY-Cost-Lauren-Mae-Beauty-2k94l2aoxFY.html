Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another
makeup math video I'm really excited for
this this takes so much more work than I
thought I want to say thank you so much
for all the feedback on my last one and
I will have that link down below we
broke down a ton of different powders
and I got your guys's feedback do grams
and ounces and it's funny because all
the things were in ounce is like on
Sephora so I'm say they show you an
ounce is what it is so I just made it
all that way cuz that's what it was but
I will do grams for powder products from
now on
but anyway today's category we're gonna
break down our settings phrase my
goodness what are we can a sentence
phrase are they makeup setting sprays
are they
makeup mists are they facial toner mists
I put everything in here because I just
didn't know where to draw the line there
are so many freaking sprays that you can
use as a makeup setting spray or not or
use it before makeup before moisturizer
in the middle of the day as a refresher
like there are so many ways to use these
products so I thought the easiest way to
not exclude anything is just to include
everything so there's a lot of
information here I'm gonna try to link
my papers I don't have them in an Excel
form at the moment hopefully by the time
I upload this I'll like figure out how
to do that for you guys to see that but
if not I'm just gonna find a way to link
my paper so you can see everything
broken down I have them on like a high
end a drugstore and then the breakdown
which is what I give to you and I'll try
to link those that way you guys can see
what was in between what didn't make
like a top or bottom list
and you can see maybe what your favorite
settings for your the one you want where
it lies in conjunction to all the other
products I think we're just gonna get
into it so I'm gonna break it down the
same way that I did last time and I want
to just we're not gonna get into it I
wanted to stay here to that make it math
for me this is just a way to put
everything on an even playing field and
figure out how much all this stuff
equals if everything was one ounce how
much would you pay for it and get rid of
the differences just to see and that
doesn't mean that just because some
things more expensive it isn't worth it
or if it's less expensive it is worth it
because we all have our favorite
formulas things work on different
people's skin and for me it just lets
you make a better decision like that's
it's just information out there so
that's how I go into this just because
something might end up being the most
expensive at least expensive I don't
necessarily think that means that we
have to get that or you're stupid if you
buy something for a different price we
all have different reasons for buying
things so I just want to throw that out
there this is just like a cool
informational thing and it can help you
make sure that if you do really like
something that it's worth paying that
extra twenty dollars an ounce or
whatever it is because it's that good
now actually on to the video
for this I broke down 28 different
drugstore / affordable setting sprays
and then I have 76 high-end ones so
overall this is over a hundred different
freaking setting sprays facial mist
facial toners that I looked at this was
a very big category because of the fact
that there are makeup setting sprays and
facial hydrating sprays in the makeup
section but there are so many skincare
ones that cross over or you could use in
a very similar way depending on what you
look for in a setting spray or just like
I think a facial mist or a makeup spray
because not all of these are gonna lock
your foundation in place but they might
you know make your powder and foundation
melt into one another which is something
that I personally like in a setting
spray so let's go into the most
expensive category this is going to be
the product that if you went to the
store just to buy it no matter how much
is in it it's going to be the most
expensive for you to purchase so for
high-end that is going to be the mo I'm
gonna just not say the first word but
it's the queen of Hungary mist this is a
$90 for 3.4 fluid ounces of product is a
lot of money it's the most expensive one
there was one right under this that was
$89 so there's they're the one that's
pretty close but $90 is the most
expensive one on my list of products
that I went through and then for
drugstore the most expensive drugstore
one that I could find and that I'm
considering drugstore because that's
another thing that maybe you guys can
help me out with in the comments but
Lori Elle's infallible makeup extender
spray is 1690
ix but it does have 3.4 fluid ounces in
it as well so very expensive definitely
an expensive product for the drugstore
there are some like more high-end or
skincare brands that have theirs priced
at that
so for L'Oreal to have it priced at that
it's pretty pricey obviously for the
drugstore these are the suggested retail
prices you can get them cheaper doing
coupons and doing sales and all of that
so that's something to consider if you
want to try to get them at a better deal
moving on to least expensive for the
high-end I have quite a few to talk to
you guys about because it was hard to
make a decision and in my last video I
had put Sephora in the high-end category
and it's like I feel like they're trying
to make it high-end but more affordable
like it's supposed to be that good of
quality but then I can also see
arguments for it being in the more
affordable range since it's supposed to
be more affordable so I have some
different options here but for the first
high-end one that's least expensive I
did put the Sephora collection hydrating
mist this is $7.50 for 1.69 fluid ounces
the next one that I decided to include
in this category was the
too-cool-for-school coconut milk II mist
this is $14 for 2.7 ounces of product
this is sold at Sephora and Ulta and I
just didn't know where it goes because
it's a Korean skincare product so I
don't know if this is on the more
affordable range or not so I just
decided to include it in the high-end
since Sephora is carrying it next we
have another product from Sephora this
is the Sephora beauty amplifier this is
$16 for 2.7 fluid ounces again didn't
know whether to include it because it's
Sephora and then the last one that I
have in this category just to kind of
give you guys a range of what is the
least expensive for what I'm considering
high-end we have the first eight Beauty
vitamin hydrating mist
this is $16 for two ounces of product
and I know for sure you can get that at
Ulta I did not see it on the Sephora
website but maybe I missed it okay so
that was a lot of information I know I
didn't have like a clear winner but let
me know down below from now on where do
you want me to count the Sephora
collection items are they in the
affordable side are they in the high-end
side let me know down below all right
and moving on to drugstore for the least
expensive drugstore setting miss we have
the elf mist inset which is four dollars
for 2.0 two ounces
product which is a pretty dang good deal
so I'm not surprised elf is there they
usually give us some pretty affordable
products the next category is going to
be about products that we have the most
product in the least amount of product
and this is if you were just going to
buy the one container doesn't matter how
much it costs what do you get the most
product in so for the most product in
the high-end category I have two
products again the product I have is
number one is the Evian mineral water
spray this is $18 but you get 10.1
ounces of product in there it's a ton
this is one again I didn't know where to
put this it's expensive and you can get
it up to four so I feel like Sephora
usually only carries high-end products
although they are kind of changing that
now with colour-pop but there are some
drugstore I don't know I just didn't
know where to put it so I put it in
high-end but the next item in the
high-end category with the most product
is the fresh rose flora toner this is
$40 for 8.5 fluid ounces of product that
is a ton of product still especially for
such an expensive item
you definitely are getting a good amount
moving on to drugstore we also have two
different products in here again because
I wasn't sure where to put some things
so the number one spot goes to Oprah and
this is the makeup fixer spray it
retails for 16 dollars but it has eight
ounces of product in it and this is one
where I don't know like to me I think of
them as kind of more affordable I don't
know if it's just the packaging but I
guess their prices when it comes to
highlighters it's definitely high-end
but then they have the coupon code so
let me know where you think Oprah lies
and I will continue on putting those
products in that area I just didn't know
I don't know for me it just seemed
drugstore and then that price was just
so affordable that I was like okay
anyway if you don't count that as an
affordable makeup brand the next product
is the Mario Badescu facial spray and
this is $12 for the 8 ounce bottle so
you're getting the exact same amount of
product in the over 1 but as you can
tell it's four dollars cheaper so those
are the items with the most products in
those categories moving on to the least
amount of product in these items for
high-end we have the Layla be a glow
face mist this is $48 for one ounce of
products you're only getting one ounce
it's not a lot of product I really
didn't see anything below an ounce an
ounce was the smallest amount but that
is so tiny when you think about the fact
that when you travel you're allowed to
have up to 3 ounces in your leg carry-on
and stuff yeah it makes me
because that's travel-sized to me and if
you're only getting 1/3 of travel size
for $48 whoo it's a lot of money anyway
for drugstore the least amount of
product comes in the LA girl HD pro
setting spray this is $5.99 for again
one fluid ounce of product Ulta did have
a travel size I think for less than an
ounce but I didn't count it because it
was a travel size and they had a
full-size version of that product
available now we are moving on to the
worst value in the least value this is
going to be divided out price per ounce
so let's get into it we're gonna start
with the worst values and we're gonna
start with high-end so the absolute
worst value for money per ounce is the
co Gendo oriental plant essence it's $89
for 1.01 ounces of product this makes it
eighty eight dollars and twelve cents
per fluid ounce so this is very very
expensive
I will say a trend that I saw with these
is that the skincare ones or toner ones
tended to be more expensive than the
makeup setting sprays I'm sure that's
because there's more science that goes
into it and there are better ingredients
so keep that in mind it might be worth
it this product might be worth it over a
cheaper setting spray because of its
ingredients but regardless this is very
very pricey for the basically ounce that
you're getting the second worst value is
the SK 2 Catera
I think is maybe I said I don't know how
to say it midday essence this is $80 for
1.6 fluid ounces and that makes this $50
per fluid ounce this is still very
expensive but when you look at the most
expensive one this is still $30 cheaper
than that over $30 cheaper so it's
definitely a better deal but it's still
very expensive coming in at number three
is the legal it'd be a glow face mist
this is $48 again for the one ounce this
was the winner for least amount of
product in high-end and so that makes
this product $48 per fluid ounce still
very very expensive this comes in right
under the SK 2 product oh it's just not
a lot of product number four we have
Tata Harper and this is the hydrating
flora essence this is $68 for 1.7 fluid
ounces and that makes it $40 per fluid
ounce and
coming in at number five is the touch of
luminous dewy skin mist I think we were
kind of expecting this one to be
somewhere on the list this retails for
$48 for 1.35 fluid ounces and that makes
this 35 dollars and 56 cents per fluid
ounce so you're paying a ton of money
and you will see that there is a stark
difference between drugstore even the
most expensive settings phrase in the
drugstore or in the more affordable
range don't even come close to some of
the more mid-range ones when it comes to
high in settings raised but anyway let's
get into the drugstore worst value
number one the worst value it's so funny
it's the elf aqua beauty primer mist
this is eight dollars for one point zero
one fluid ounces and the size of this is
really what's killing it eight dollars
is not a bad price for a setting mist
but the fact that you're only getting an
ounce of product that makes this seven
dollars and ninety two cents per fluid
ounce and it really it's just really
expensive it's more expensive per fluid
ounce than the L'Oreal one that we had
already talked about coming in at number
two is the Revlon Photoready mist this
retails for $12.99 for 1.9 fluid ounces
of product and that makes it six dollars
and 84 cents per fluid ounce the third
worst value for affordable setting
sprays comes from morphe this is the
continuous setting mist it retails for
$15 and you get 2.5 fluid ounces of
product in there you can obviously use a
code to get a discount but I am going
off of the retail value and that makes
it six dollars per fluid ounce of
product coming in at number four is the
LA girl HD pro setting spray this is
$5.99 for one fluid ounce of product
which makes one fluid ounce of product
$5.99 and this one was already mentioned
again in the least amount of product
category for drugstore and the fifth
worst value is the L'Oreal infallible
makeup extender spray this is 1699 for
3.4 fluid ounces of product so you're
getting a lot of product but it's just
very pricey and that makes this $5 per
fluid ounce so even the most expensive
ones at the drugstore are still so much
more affordable than the more expensive
more skincare ones at Sephora or from
those more high-end luxury brands that
all being said let's get into the
products that are the best value the
things that if you're really wanting to
get the best bang for your buck
these are
the items you're gonna want to look at
when it comes to high-end and the
drugstore or more affordable I know a
lot of you guys were saying that you
aren't from the states and so the
drugstore isn't really a thing but just
think of drugstore has synonymous with
more affordable makeup alright so coming
in at number one for the best value in
the high-end category we have the Evian
mineral water spray this is $18 for 10.1
fluid ounces of product which makes it a
dollar eighty for a fluid ounce of
product again whether this count is high
unto you that you can decide it's a lot
of product that you're getting but I
will say literally this is canned water
so my god if this isn't the best deal
there's something wrong cuz this is
literally just canned water a lot of
makeup artists use this so that you have
like really sanitary water to spray on
people's faces to create sweat if you
just need water for whatever it is but
yes the canned water is number one for
the best value coming in at number two
is a very similar product this is from
Kota Lee and it's the grape water it's
$18 as well for 6.7 fluid ounces which
makes it two dollars and 67 cents per
fluid ounce this is supposed to have a
few more I think skin care ingredients
but it's essentially canned water Sam
just got home so I don't quite know
where I am but I think I was at the
number three best value when it comes to
high-end products and that is from
little barn apothecary
it's the coconut and mint cooling
mineral mist it's $22 for eight ounces
and that makes it two dollars and
seventy five cents per fluid ounce this
is sold at Ulta and the reason I put
this in the high-end category is because
all their other skincare is very very
expensive so I thought that it was
appropriate to put it in the high-end
category number four for the best value
is from skin-food this is the Yuja water
sea whitening mist it's $22 for 6.7
ounces of product making it three
dollars and 28 cents per fluid ounce and
last on the list is from h2o plus and
it's the Oasis quench the day mist it's
$18 for five ounces of product and that
makes it three dollars and sixty cents
per fluid ounce so everything in the
best value is less than $4 per ounce of
product which is amazing and a lot of
these have a lot of ounces that you're
getting this product is going to last
you a long time moving on to director
let's talk about the best
at the drugstore so this is going to be
the best of the best and this is the
best value when it comes to anything
this is the formula ten point zero point
six is that how you say that brand I'm
not sure but it's the B berry balanced
grape spray toner it's $6.99 but you get
5.1 ounces of product and then making it
a dollar and 37 cents per fluid ounce
that is an amazing deal number two is a
very cult classic favorite it's the
Mario Badescu facial setting spray no
matter which one you get if you get it
in the 8 ounce and you spend $12 on it
it's going to come out to a dollar fifty
per fluid ounce next on the list was
something that one for least expensive
product and it's the elf mist and set
it's $4 for 2.0 two ounces of product
making it a dollar ninety eight per
fluid ounce number four for best value
is the O friend makeup fixer spray
it's $16 for eight fluid ounces and that
makes it two dollars per fluid ounce and
last we have the Garnier skin active
soothing facial mist it is $8.99 it has
4.4 fluid ounces of product in it making
it two dollars and four cents per fluid
ounce oh my gosh
that was so many freaking numbers you
guys don't even know so there are some
amazing deals out there if you're really
looking for them at the end of this
video I like to leave you guys with just
some interesting thoughts and things
that I observed as I was doing all this
math and looking at all these products
and there are a few things that came up
number one I would say that the average
price for high-end products per ounce is
between $8 and $10 so when we're looking
at the urban decay settings phrase we're
looking at a lot of to face setting
sprays basically any product that's
around $30 and you get around four
ounces is gonna come out to that between
$8 and $10 price range so if you're
looking for something in the middle
those are definitely very average prices
that I seem to find they fell on the
middle of the list they're not the most
expensive but they're definitely not the
least expensive also something that I
noticed there were a ton of ties whether
it was products having the exact same
amount of ounces for the exact same
price or whether it was because the way
it worked out mathematically is that
there were thirty dollars for three
ounces or $20 for two ounces makes it
both $10 for an ounce of product there
were ties between the Urban Decay all
nighter and basically every version of
the Urban Decay sprays
the two-faced peach mist mattifying
spray the two-faced hangover spray the
herbivore rose hibiscus coconut water
the first aid beauty vitamin hydrating
mist the doctor roebucks Bondi hydrating
miss have you guys tried that one
and the laura geller spackle mist those
are all $8 per fluid ounce all of them
so like no matter what that you would
just go with the formula you wanted
because they're going to equal out to
the same price at the $10 range there
were a lot of ties tarts worn one
setting mist
tarts Ready Set radiant skin miss the
Sephora perfection mist the pretty
vulgar locket in setting spray and the
dr. Dennis gross c plus collagen skin
set those all equal $10 per fluid ounce
we had some ties in the drugstore as
well the maybelline face studio spray as
well as the flower of beauty won both
retail for $12.99 and you get 3.4 fluid
ounces in both of them so they are both
$3.82 per fluid ounce and last Verte
eyes we have the Pacifica crystal power
hidroméis or any version of the Pacifica
sprays they tied with the skin fix
coconut water hydrating mist both of
those came out to 2 dollars and 50 cents
per fluid ounce lots of different ties I
mean I guess there are only so many like
combinations of prices and fluid ounces
and a lot of them have pretty standard
fluid ounces and stuff so I thought that
was very interesting another note that I
took is that when a product is more in
the skincare realm I feel like you're
gonna get more product for whatever
price it is even if the price is higher
you're still getting more product in
that item so if you're looking for
something that's gonna last you a bit
longer even if you're willing to invest
I definitely think getting something
more in the skincare realm is going to
give you more ounces where is when
makeup brands do this even if it's just
a hydrating toner you're not getting as
much product most of the time another
note that I had here was that when it
comes to price the more expensive items
tend to be skincare so yes you're
getting more but you are paying more for
those ingredients and that technology or
whatever is in that product obviously
you would have to look at specific
ingredients and products to compare if
they're worth it or not but a lot of the
times the skincare companies are
charging a lot more money for their
products it's a lot more money and if it
a lot of money it's probably mostly
water another note that I put on here
was getting less than two ounces is
 I don't know just looking at
the products that I did if you're
getting less into analysis I really
think that it's pretty messed up unless
the price is worth it like the elf one
that one is four dollars it's the
cheapest one and you are getting two
ounces but it still makes sense price
per ounce but with so many of the other
ones if you're getting less than two
ounces in there I mean it's just it's
just making it creep up in price more so
I also don't like to replace my sprays
unless you're wanting to try a bunch of
different things out then it works out
for that because you can get through
them without them expiring and you can
try out different things but if you're
looking for something that's gonna last
you I definitely think you should go for
something with more than two ounces of
product in it I also put on here that
spray cans of water are expensive but
less expensive than other mist I put
this on here because I feel like the
Evian spray and even the Codel a spray
they're just so expensive because I know
they're just water but you are usually
getting quite a bit of product in there
and when you do on price per ounce they
do work out they just don't have maybe
the same ingredients so that was
something that was interesting to me and
then last year I think I just want to
say that no matter what you're probably
going to be saving money if you go with
drugstore over high-end even the most
expensive ones don't even hit the $8
range of the ones that I looked at and
that's right at where like the Urban
Decay ones are so if you're getting one
of the mid-range drugstore ones you are
definitely saving quite a bit per float
out yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
makeup math video these really do take
quite a bit of time to do so I'm not
sure what I want to do next I know a lot
of you guys mentioned doing highlighters
and I think that'd be really fun
either that or concealers those are the
two that I'm kind of looking at next but
let me know what you want to see down
below and I hope you guys enjoyed this I
hope you didn't fall asleep because I
know it's a lot but so many of you guys
are telling me that you enjoyed this
video so I really hope you liked it and
I will see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
