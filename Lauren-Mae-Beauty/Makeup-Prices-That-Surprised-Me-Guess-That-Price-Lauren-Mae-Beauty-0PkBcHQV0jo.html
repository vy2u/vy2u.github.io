Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted haha I wanted to cough at
you today I wanted to talk about some
items that I felt like the price was
kind of surprising so I don't know I
kind of wanted this to be like a guess
that price so I'm gonna try to format it
that way where you guys can maybe like
do a little mental guess of what you
think the price would be and then we'll
get into like similarly priced products
and these aren't all like super
expensive and they're not all like way
cheaper than you thought they're like a
mix of stuff it was on sephora's website
like I do just browsing and checking
things out and looking around and there
was a product from Clinique that really
surprised me in price it was the pep
start facial wipes which when I was
doing research for this video weren't
even on there anymore so that kind of
doesn't work out as a product for this
but it was the inspiration it was 50
wipes for $7 I was like what that is way
cheaper than I thought that yeah I
thought they'd at least be like a $15
white but they were half that price so I
was like wow that's amazing and I
thought you know what I should look at
products and see if there's anything in
certain lines that just kind of stands
out like why is it that price it's so
weird compared to everything else so
that's what we're gonna do so let's just
get into it the first item here is from
cover effects and this one you guys
probably all know the price on but these
are the glitter drops so I'm gonna give
you some prices of some other products
that they have and then we can maybe no
I don't know how I want to format those
I think I do and then I don't I'm just
gonna tell you the price and then we'll
talk about why I think it's crazy okay
yeah so the cover FX glitter drops
retail for $44 for half a fluid ounce
and that's expensive that's so much
money I want to give you some prices on
other products in their lines if you
want to get the custom cover drops it's
going to be the exact same price at $44
4.5 ounces of product if you want to
pick up their natural finish foundation
that's gonna run you $42 which is $2
cheaper and if you want to get the
pressed powder foundation that's 38 for
me I find that complexion products are
usually really expensive primers the
foundations even conceal
can be a little bit pricey so for the
foundation to be less than some glitter
drops which aren't going to be something
you're going to use every single day I
just think it's it's just insane I was
not expecting everything else in their
price range to be that way like if the
glitter drops are gonna be that much
then I expect the foundations to be in
the 50s and like 55 or something because
I'm used to that difference in price but
I was kind of surprised that those
coverfx glitter drops are so expensive I
don't know if the product is just they
just priced it that way because it's in
the same packaging and product of the
other drops that they have out or if the
glitter just makes it more expensive but
I can't see it being that much more
expensive so that one was really
surprising to me the next item is also
from cover FX now this is the cover FX
enhanced click highlighter stick guess
what that's gonna retail for we have a
highlighter from cover FX Oh what are
you thinking 30 $40 no no no no $18 come
on I think you guys know that this does
only have point 1 7 ounces of product in
it so it's not a huge thing it's like
kind of like a lipstick size is what it
looks like but I just think that
compared to all the other pricing it's
just so much lower like I know I'm
surprised like wait it's this much and I
want to state here because I didn't see
it at the beginning cuz I was all over
the place brands can charge whatever
they want to charge how they want to
brand themselves even if the product
doesn't cost much to make if they want
to be a luxury brand or they want to be
a brand that sells high-priced makeup
then they're gonna sell their makeup out
of high price no matter what that margin
is that's just what they want their
brand to be and they can do that people
can buy it and if they don't want to buy
it then maybe they'll want to lower
their prices or maybe they'll keep it at
the price like whatever that's the
market but what I'm more interested in
is that if you're a brand you would have
like consistent pricing or seemingly
consistent pricing and some of these
just didn't fall into that consistent
pricing is what I thought at least I
also want to mention too I'm not really
taking into consideration product amount
although I think that could be a reason
that some of these things maybe aren't
as high-priced because only having 0.17
ounces in a product it's not that much
so then you know it's lower price but
it's still really high price if you were
to compare that to other products you
know in a similar vein I'm just talking
about if you have a product and you are
like here it's this much money for it
and you're
whoa that's way more or way less than I
thought it would be anyway enough of
that let's move on to the next product
this one is from Lancome and this is
another highlighter I'm sorry they're
just highlighters you know they run the
game so this is the clicking glow
highlighting skin fluid from Lancome and
this cost $23 which I thought was just
so inexpensive again this barely has any
product in it it's point zero eight
ounces and it's barely anything but when
you compare that with some of their
other staple items in their line I can
never say this their tint Udall
foundation retails for forty seven
dollars for an ounce their camouflage
concealer is 31 dollars they have a
powder blush for a thirty-two and then
they're illuminating powder highlighter
is 40 so I just feel like this is very
very low in price I don't know if
they're trying to go for like a younger
market with it or what it is but it
definitely just kind of shocked me that
it was in the twenty dollar range for
illuminating product I would have
thought that it would be more in like
the thirty dollar range
I'm not mad though I mean I would always
take something being less expensive next
I want to talk about makeup forever
glitters these are priced at $15 which I
thought was a really great deal there's
starlet powders retail for $21 they're
aqua excel color paints which are a
liquid like a cream eyeshadow those
retail for 25 and in there Diamond
powders retail for 25 to so I thought it
would be more in that price range of
like 25 24 definitely at least into the
20s so seeing it at 15 I thought that
was a really reasonable price I feel
like that's pretty comparable to violet
Voss glitters or even like lit cosmetics
I think those might be a little bit more
inexpensive but still I just thought
with makeup forever
all their stuff is pretty pricy I just
thought they'd be at a higher price
point and I was happy to see that
cosmetic grade glitter if you wanted to
pick something up for Halloween or
whatever it wouldn't be like insanely
expensive you wouldn't have to drop a
whole 20 you could just drop 3/4 of it
next on the list is a product from Bobby
Brown and this one's probably this one
and one other one are kind of like the
biggest ones to me but this is just a
normal brow product it has point zero
one ounces of product in it which is not
a lot of product if you think the
anasazi ones have a little bit of
product I believe this have point zero
two ounces so this even has half it only
has half of that product
I'm gonna give you a second to like
collect your thoughts on what you think
this is are you ready for it cuz this
retails for $44 you could get the
glitter drops or this eyebrow pencil at
least eyebrow pencil you'd probably use
every day but this is insanely
ridiculous I feel like this is even
insanely ridiculous when you look at
bobbi brown's line you can get a full
coverage concealer for $30 you could get
a foundation stick for $46 so for two
more dollars you can get something for
your entire face and coverage on your
face and foundations are traditionally a
lot more expensive than a brow product
and it's only two dollars mark i just
like i can't i thought that the price of
the brow pencil would be more at the
price of their eyeliner pencils which
retail for $27 but no no i don't know
what's magical about this brow pencil
doesn't like grow your eyebrows i don't
know it was insane enough i was like
that's a joke right it's a typo right
whew
it's just too rich for my blood alright
moving on the next product is from black
up and this is their strobing based
primer this one isn't like insanely a
big deal but I just feel like primers
and this one is kind of like a
highlighting primer it retails for $44
for one ounce of product and I just
think it's weird when a primer retails
for more money than the foundation
itself I get that like primers are
important and like you know it's before
you put the foundation on to make it
look really good and some of them can
have skincare benefits but they're
mattifying fluid foundation retails for
4150 so not insanely less money than the
primer but still I just I don't know in
my head just like foundations are like
this staple based product that's just
kind of like the most pricy thing out of
a range there anti-shine loose powder
retails for $32 and then their tinted
moisturizer retails for 39 50 so I just
thought it was interesting that that
product retailed for so much when the
other products didn't I don't know that
was not like a big of a deal but still
it's like a good five dollars more next
we're going to talk about Natasha don't
know this girl is known for her crazy
prices we have the new blush palette
that retails for $89 they're Lila
palette which is like less expensive
than their most notorious ones that are
like 250 is only 129 she also has a
black eyeshadow that's supposed to be
one of the most black eyeshadows on the
market and that retails for $29 for just
a single pan of black eyeshadow so what
do you guys think
a primer would be from her a face primer
a fluid ounce of face primer right like
you're thinking of god I can't afford
this well you might be able to because
it's only $35 I mean it's not like crazy
reasonable but compared to her branding
I feel like that's pretty dang good and
then when you think about it against the
black up one which is $44 this is almost
$10 cheaper for Natasha - no no this is
the face globe primer which I'm really
into like more glowy primers lately so I
definitely want to try that out and I
was so surprised to see it on such a
like good price I feel like that's like
the price I'm talking about Natasha I
have two more products to talk about the
next one is a skincare item from origins
and this is the ginseng energy boost gel
moisturizer now this is a product to
actually had at one point Influenster
sent it out to me and I did an empties
video I was talking about it and was
like oh I won't repurchase this though
because it's too expensive it's like 50
$60 oh no it's not it's like half that
price it retails for 2854 1.7 fluid
ounces I think that is such an amazing
price I obviously was under the wrong
impression of how expensive origins
products are now don't get me wrong some
of their items are expensive they have
the mega mushroom soothing lotion which
is $66 for the same amount of product
they have an antioxidant moisturizer
which is $44 for the same amount of
product and then even one of their
anti-aging powder face masks retails for
$36 I think that I just was under the
impression that origins was all
expensive but I think they have multiple
different lines where the ginseng is a
little bit less expensive so if you're
on a budget I don't think it has as good
of like anti-aging benefits and stuff
but if you're looking for something
that's good quality a little bit more
natural and all that I think that that's
a great one I enjoyed it and I just
think 2850 is a really good price
especially when some of the lotions in
the drugstore can get up to that $30
price range pretty fast so I was really
surprised at that one I was under the
wrong impression originally and I
thought that one was definitely cool
that it was less money than I thought
and the last item here is just a fun one
but this is from vaniville she this is
the beauty sponge so when I think of
Jumanji I think of like expensive ass
makeup just like really expensive stuff
you're paying for the name
paying for this like luxury brand just
to give you an idea some of their
products they're loose powder retails
for $56 their bronzer retails for $53
and their soft powder radiance enhancer
retails for $57 for just a powder
highlighter so what do you think a
beauty sponge from them would retail for
twenty dollars that's it guys I mean
it's still expensive but it's the exact
same price as a Beauty Blender so I
thought that was really interesting I
wonder if it's any good it's like in
this really like pointy shape I think
it's very like structural it kind of
looks like the morphe sponge though but
I found that was really interesting I
saw that today and it like sealed the
deal for me to film this video I was
like I'm gonna do it that one's going on
there I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I know I was a little all over the place
cuz I do really know my formatting for
how I want to talk about these but I
just thought it was fun to kind of like
look at Beauty prices I love just like
analyzing different products and why
they're different prices and I just like
to get weird like that I hope you guys
enjoyed it I was thinking about doing a
video where I'm analyzing products and
like going through categories let's say
concealers and doing like the top three
most expensive based on the actual
amount of products you're getting and in
the top three least expensive based off
product so let me know if you'd like a
series like that or if it's just like
weird and geeky and you don't want to
see that I just thought that might be
interesting to like look at all of the
DOE foot applicator like let's say
concealers all the most popular ones and
then just you know figuring out based
off of the amount of products you're
getting and the price which ones are the
most expensive and the least expensive
even though they might not be when you
go pay for them it's just amount of
product anyway if you'd be interested
let me know and I might do that it's
just gonna be a little bit more research
than I'm used to doing for a video but I
think it could be a fun idea and just
kind of a different way of looking at
beauty products I love doing that kind
of like flipping things on their head
just like trying to get a better
understanding and a better handle on the
money I'm spending on products and what
I'm bringing into my collection and all
that you guys know anyway that's
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
