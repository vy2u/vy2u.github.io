Lauren in this video and I'm going to be
telling you guys all the products I want
to use up in 2016 so this kind of goes
hand-in-hand with my last video beauty
resolutions for 2016 and then these are
the products I want to use up these were
all picked because they're older items
in my collection and I kind of made
myself a bargain like either I'm gonna
use them up this year and by the end of
the year they'll be done or I'm going to
throw them away if they're not done by
the end of this year they just have to
go so I have 20 items here that I'm
gonna focus on you guys will see this
stuff throughout the year in either
project pans or project use it ups or if
I'm using them outside of those I will
show you in empties let me know I think
I'm gonna only do like a halfway point
type of video or maybe a quarterly video
on where I am with using these items up
I did try to do a video like this or
like a project like this last year or
this year
whatever 2015 and it was really
difficult I wasn't that successful at it
so I'm really hoping that this year I
can use this stuff up stay focused but
let's get into the products that I want
to use up in 2016 I feel like there's a
lot of face products and foundation
products in here because I do have some
older items and I just want to clear
them out so first off here this is the
Revlon Colorstay this is the whipped
formula and this is in 110 ivory I have
already used quite a bit you can see
there I just want to finish this item up
get it out of my collection it's older
and I know that the cap kind of can
break and stuff I've heard that a lot so
I just want to get it out before it goes
bad before it dries up get my money's
worth and use this product I think I'm
gonna keep the container afterward
because it's really nice and all this
stuff on it are just stickers so it
would just be like a nice container even
though hopefully if the lid doesn't
crack by that point right what am I
talking about anyway I want to use this
up I would say to I'm a little bit under
halfway done with that product another
foundation item this is the Rimmel stay
matte in like porcelain number zero 10 I
think this will be kind of difficult to
use up it's a very moosie type of
formula very thick I haven't used this
color in a long time but it's quite
light for me so I'm gonna have to
probably mix it in stuff to make it work
and this is a full bottle there I've
never used I've used it like twice or
something it was just me when I wanted
it so I got it two more Mound ation
items these are the bareMinerals
original foundation and fairly light I
have two of them I just want to use both
of them up so I'm counting it as one
item this isn't like a bad product
I do find bare minerals and foundations
make me itch especially if I start to
sweat or if it's hot outside so I don't
hate these items I just don't need them
in my collection and I have a tart
powder foundation so I don't need these
so I just want to use them up one of
them is mostly done I don't know if you
can see one of them this one is like
down to here so almost done and then
this one is essentially like I think
full so just want to use both of those
up again these count as one item item
number four is this powder from
Maybelline this is the fit me powder in
natural beige 220 I have used this only
a handful of times it's honestly a
little dark for me so I'm gonna save
this until summer and use it like
underneath my eyes I like this powder I
think it's great for people with a dry
skin but it just doesn't keep me matte
and that's what I need a powder to do so
I think the texture of it so nice it
just doesn't work long-term on my skin
all day so I want to get through this
powder I have a few primer type of items
to use up this is the Becca ever matte
poreless priming Perfector I am right
there on it so about halfway done I
don't like this item and I didn't
realize I didn't like it until after I
had bought the full size I went through
a deluxe a sample and liked it and then
it just took me a long time to realize I
didn't like this so I just want to
finish it up it was a very expensive
primer and I'm just gonna find a way to
make this work for me throughout the
year I just really want to get my
money's worth out of this one
specifically I'm just gonna use I think
a little bit every single day and
hopefully by the end of the year it's
gone this is a mini product from benefit
this is dr. feelgood it's like a primer
but you can also use it on top of your
makeup to make you look matte it's kind
of like that Mally one so I want to use
this up I just bought this because I
wanted to try it and I still have not
tried it so stupid and I just don't need
it but I want to use it this is the
Tarte CC primer in the color fair that's
what it looks like it has the different
ones I like using this as like a tinted
moisturizer it's nice that's all
I have left on it so I just want to
finish it up this year it's not like a
bad product I just it's just older and
it's need to get it out and I have kind
of replaced this with my steel ones my
steel a CC cream stick foundation type
of things which if you want those they
were on sale last time I checked on the
website for $5 so go check those out but
this is really nice I just want to use
it up and I know how much left this is
the Stila one-step prime color and
kitten I did put this in I think I
wanted to use it up this year and I
didn't so that's where I started and
then I used a little bit and now I'm
here I'm gonna use this as a face primer
and it's gonna just give me whoa I was
thinking about just using this as a face
primer and have a little bit of like
luminosity to it and I think I'll just
use it up faster that way since it's a
bigger area to cover we'll see how that
goes
I just want this out of my collection
this year so it's gone I have quite a
few cream face products that I want to
use up because again creams go bad and
the ones that I've had the longest I
just kind of want to start moving out
instead of throwing them away this is
the bourgeois bronzing primer this is
very similar or so people said to the
slate and a Chanel or whatever it is
this is a cream bronzer or contouring
cream that's what I'm gonna use it as I
actually really like this I used it
today and I just think it gave really
subtle contour if you do want to put a
real bronzer on I really like it so I'm
excited to use it up this year I've had
it a little over a year now and it just
needs to go so actually yeah it's gonna
be like two years so I really gotta use
assembly I have to cream cheek products
these are both by Stila these are the
convertible colors I have this one in
the color
lilium and I have used this before there
was a time when all I used was cream
blush that's all I liked to use and this
is one of the ones I really liked you
can also use this on a lips so that's a
way it can double task it and these are
just older in my collection they're also
pretty small so I'm hoping I can make it
through these and then the other color
is peony and that's what it looks like
they're very neutral colors I feel like
they'll go with a lot of the looks that
I like to do this is benefits high-beam
this is a product I've never really used
I haven't
and I just want to use it up it's an
iconic product and I think it is a
really nice color it's like a pink toned
highlighter but I just haven't reached
for it so it's a way for me to either
use it up or again it's a reason to
declutter it because it's like well you
didn't use it up all year so get rid of
it everything left our eye products I -
cream shadows in here from benefit this
one is in the color top oh no this one
is in top brass this is sipping and
dippin as you can see they've already
pulled away from the sides but they're
still so creamy
that's a swatch of it there it's like
this peachy golden color so I want to
use that in the summer and the other
color here is this is top brass and I
haven't used this nearly as much as I
use the other one that's a swatch of it
there so definitely just a nice bronzy
neutral color the benefit cream shadows
are my favorite cream shadows I've ever
used
they stayed creamy for a super long time
even when they start drying out they're
still creamy you don't crease on me so I
don't need to use a base and this and a
lot of them work really well it's like
one shadow easy look so I just want to
get through both of these this year
they're my last two cream shadows from
them and then I can kind of just have a
couple and start over with the cream
shadows that I wanted my collection last
but not least our eyeliners I have so
many eyeliners to use up this year we've
seen eyeliners like this all year long
for me and these are the last two
I have violet and indigo here I'm
already working on violet and that is
what I have left of that to use up I'm
excited to get through this one this
one's moving so fast it's not pressed as
hard as a couple of the other ones I was
using so I think this will go pretty
dang fast this wise indigo I haven't
used this at all it still has like the
tip to it so that's how much I have left
of that these ones don't have much
product in it so it is easier to use
them up than other liners
I just really I'm excited to get all of
those out of my collection it'll be so
good this one's from Tarte it's in a
brown color and it's called the Tarte
emphasized aqua gel eyeliner that's all
I know about it I can't twist it up for
you guys to tell you where I'm at but
this liner is so wet it's crazy it's
like putting the what is like a it's
like putting a gel eyeliner on your eye
that's not I don't even know I can't
even tell you I'm trying and I'm
literally at a loss
for words it's not a good liner I don't
like this but I just want to try to use
it up and get it out this is a Smashbox
liner in onyx and that's where I'm at
it's a pencil liner so I have to sharpen
it it was a short size so that's what I
have to use up this year I don't think
this will be too hard because I'll just
use it to tightline but it's also quite
a hard pencil so you don't have to
sharpen it very often so we'll see last
but not least this is the icy last but
not least in every video like every
single one I'm so sorry I said annoys
you because it kind of annoys me when I
edit it anyway this is the liner from K
Mary Kay k-beauty
what oh no it's broken inside I didn't
realize well it's broken insights that I
have to be very very careful we're gonna
say that that's how much I have it's so
drooped out so I definitely need to get
a move on on this liner because I want
to actually use it up there was a lot of
product in it and I actually really
liked this liner color wise I think it
really brings out the blue in my eyes
it'll be nice to get this one gone and
use it up those are all the products
that I want to use up in 2016 I'm
excited too again like I've said
continue the journey on really refining
down my collection into things I really
really love and that I don't want to
just use up I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
