is going to be my declutter video now I
went through my makeup this is actually
the third time since i started my
channel so i have my huge declutter
videos which were kind of the start of
this whole thing and i went through
every section it was very intense and
then i had one other one where i went
through and just showed you in this way
that i'm doing this video and then i
have this one now i feel like with every
stage i'm willing to let go more and
more makeup I've definitely not bought
as much makeup as I'm getting rid of
between each one so I'm definitely
whittling down my collection and being
more real with myself each time I do one
of these videos so i hope this inspires
you to let go of some things that maybe
are cluttering your makeup collection
but that you don't even want to use
anyway i'm just going to get to all the
stuff in this bin I know it's a lot of
stuff I was really honest with myself I
love watching other people's to clutter
videos I feel like it inspires me to
really go through my crap and get rid of
it so let's do it I'm gonna set it on a
little thing here i also i like the way
that this video lets you can see more of
me not me but you know me hopefully I
won't have to break this up into two
parts but I might but I'm going to start
with pallets so I'm getting rid of three
large pallet the first one is this tart
one this is be magnificent I did use
this palette a little bit I just I
wanted to declutter it last time but
didn't have the will I guess you could
say and I'm just getting rid of it the
blush on here has hard pan although that
was the reason I really was keeping it
from the last time I have the tart
tartlet palette which I feel like these
shades are very similar to and I do have
other blushes like that that don't have
hard pan and I'm not going to get into
this palette just for the blush
obviously I haven't used it so I'm going
to be passing this one on I feel good to
get rid of this it's so beautiful I do
love the packaging i love the colors but
i have stuff like it and i just am not
using it so it needs to go the next year
pallets are from Too Faced and I
actually got these from work so at work
if we sell out of a pallet that's like
lemon
edition or we don't have any more then
you know we can take that test or home
so the first one here is the mat I
palette from Too Faced it is in the old
packaging it's like not been used at all
as a tester and I am getting rid of this
and passing it on and took it from work
because it was like they're so pretty
they're all mad oh la Lauren you have so
many matte palette so I don't need this
and I'd rather someone else use it as I
was watching through my collection I'm
just not excited to use this palette
like I am other things and I am gonna
get a couple holiday pallets I'm going
to try to limit myself but I think I'm
gonna end up getting for at this point I
already have two coming oh I'm super
excited for them though and I'm excited
to use those and I'm not excited to use
this so i would rather use those up than
this not that i'm going to use them up
but use them and enjoy them then
worrying about this being in my
collection and be wasting its i'm going
to pass it on and then the next one here
is the to face all the mode eyes palette
this had so much hype around it when it
came out it was limited edition and once
we sold the last one we had i was so
excited to take it home but i just have
these colors I don't need this palette I
just don't need it so I'm going to pass
it and someone who doesn't have those
colors in their collection can enjoy it
but I don't need to have it just because
it's limited edition and I did want it
at one point but didn't and I just don't
need it so passing that one next I have
some blushes now blushes are really hard
for me I shadows and blushes are kind of
the things that I ki have the most of
and the thing that I feel the least
guilty about having because if they're
powder they're not gonna go bad for a
long time I love having variety I love
just pallets in general so they are the
most difficult but I do have three
different like blush things like powder
blushes that I'm getting rid of the
first one here is this little tart mini
this is from the Holiday Collection last
year in a more and the reason I'm
getting rid of this there's gold shimmer
in this and I usually like a matte blush
or maybe a light sheen that looks more
like skin or like Dewey or something
like a glow from within but this just
has gold Sparkle throughout it and I'm
not going to use it I don't want to
panic I don't
want a pan it so it means I definitely
don't want to use it if I'm forcing
myself to panic so I'm gonna let someone
else get some love out of this shade
really pretty shade it's just for my
preferences I don't need this another
chart thing it's like tart and to face
it's all I'm getting rid of um this is a
blush from Tarte it's so beautiful I
think this color blush is really nice it
kind of turns that peachy pinky bronzy
color I've just had it for a while and I
got it in the QVC set and I just don't
use it it's called pink bronze and I'd
rather have someone else use it i have
other shades that are kind of that
subdued pink color that i enjoy and love
using and I feel like I'd be making
myself use this one so I rather while
it's still nice and fresh let someone
else use it and the next one that I'm
getting rid of I was really surprised
but I'm happy about this is from benefit
it's like a it's a blush for some or
trio I think there's no like three in it
actually I got this from all cosmetics
wholesale when I got it it did come
broken but this is dallas this is
dandelion and this is coralista i have a
small departed blush of coralista the
same size and I've had this for a long
time and I've never ever ever used it
I've never used it and I think because
it came broken maybe that turning me off
to using it and then I kept it because
it's like well then I don't need to buy
the full size like I don't need to buy
the full sizes anyway so I'm getting rid
of this and I'm happy about that because
it's just sitting there and they're
beautiful and someone else can
definitely get these and love them but
if I really want Dallas and that's kind
of the color I feel like I'm keeping
this whole thing for then I can figure
that out later but I don't need to be
hoarding this in the meantime lon not
even using it so I'm getting rid of this
and passing it on keeping with blushes
these are all my cream blushes that I'm
getting rid of on this declutter this
I'm getting rid of three of the turret
cheeks dance you guys know if you've
watched any of my videos I bought that
huge freaking thing huge regret and I've
slowly and slowly declutter them each
time so I had for now I'm getting rid of
three so I only have one left besides my
mini one that I'm working on in a
project pan I just don't use these
I don't care that I spent that much
money on them any longer they still need
to go I don't want to use them and it
it's done the facts or I paid for it and
I have them and I don't want to use them
so what am I going to do I'm going to
pass them on I don't want them sitting
around taunting me any longer I'm not
going to use them so I'd rather while
they're still good let someone else use
them then you know be miserable trying
to use them up it's just life's too
short I have too much makeup to do that
so they're going and I kept that I think
exposed which I feel like is definitely
if I was gonna use a cream blush the
color I'd want to use and yeah I feel
good about keeping just that one that
one doesn't seem too you know daunting
but having multiple it's just too much
the next cream blush and I think the
last one this is from Korres this came
in a little set it came with something
else I don't remember what and it's a
beautiful blush color I just don't use
it and it came kind of hard like it's
definitely not a super creamy blush
that's a swatch of it there I mean it's
beautiful I just don't use it and there
was a time when I only used cream
blushes and that's kind of around when I
bought this and I just don't need it
anymore and I'm not going to use it I
don't really have a desire to use it I'd
rather use up other things in my
collection and that was kind of the
inspiration to you going off on a little
chant in here i am doing project pans
and i do love project panning it's fun
it makes you excited about using stuff
up and when you do finish items it just
feels so good to get your money's worth
and just to not let something go to
waste but while you're doing them you
are using these items over and over and
over and sometimes you're like i just
want to use this blush and this and a
lot of the stuff in this de plata are
things that after my project pan I'm not
like excited to use those things I'm
excited to use other things so why even
have those other things in my collection
like this so that's kind of my thoughts
why like too cluttered this time anyway
getting rid of this I think there's only
two more face products left than it's
mostly eye and lip after that this is a
by Terry foundation this is the a clot
opulent neutrally lifting foundation I
got this from or
and I did get it like because it was a
tester and I got a new one um part of me
just feels uncomfortable using this it's
a pot and I don't want to I feel just
gross using it the smell of it is a
little off putting I don't know if
that's just the way it is I know a lot
of her stuff is heavily fragrance I just
don't I'm not going to use it I don't
want it sitting on my foundation drawer
so i'm going to i think i'm just gonna
throw it away i know that sounds a
wasteful but honestly with testers you
just don't know who got into this who's
grubby little hands um got into this
product before you were using it and
it's been sitting there collecting
bacteria that whole time and then you're
passing it and then keeping it in your
collection like gross I don't know why I
even took it honestly so I'm getting rid
of that and throwing it away last i
believe for face products upside down
wrong way this is from physicians
formula this is the healthy wear bronzer
with SPF 50 i did use this quite a bit
when i first got it and it was a nice
bronzer that was like light weight and
not very dark is what I mean not
lightweight but like light in color and
I did like it for that but I haven't
used it since it's not something that
I'm really wanting to use in my
collection so I'm going to I'm gonna see
if someone wanted and if they want it
they can have it if not I'm going to
throw it away from here oh now I'm just
gonna pull stuff out instead of being in
categories because it's just going to
take a long time if I do that this is a
little pixie sealer I'm getting rid of
this i got it from all cosmetics
wholesale thinking oh that's a great
tool to have I have one in my kit and I
just don't need this one as well I just
use mac fix+ if I'm gonna do like a
foiled look or something so I just have
never used it and i don't think i'm
going to someone to get rid of it i'll
probably just throw it away honestly
it's probably bad i went through my
collection and got rid of two mascaras i
have been doing a great job of not
opening my mascaras when I do get new
ones plus I haven't bought a mascara and
I don't know how long honestly most of
my mascaras our minis and I get them
from like 100 point perks or just random
stuff I don't actually like pay for them
so these two are going this one is the
buxom one it's the sculpted lash mascara
and this is what the brush looks like i
did use this a little bit but it's just
an open too long and i have used it
somewhat so just bacterias and growing
and I don't ever want to use it again so
why is it there it shouldn't be bye-bye
this I don't even know when I bought so
that's I'm getting rid of it I I don't
know when I got this so it's just the
voluminous mascara that's the hydro
proof though so all I'm sorry yeah
waterproof the waterproof version so I'm
getting rid of that I just can't even
remember when I got this so I don't know
if I did open it or not it wasn't in
packaging so it's going i'm getting rid
of these two korres lip butters i have
been working on my korres lip butters
throughout the year I've already used up
a guava one and a Jasmine one and I
think since I'm getting rid of these two
the only want to have left is Jasmine
these I just don't have a desire to use
they are tinted they are tinted deeper
than those two other shades and those
are just shades I gravitate to more than
these ones and to sit there and use
these up like I already have too many
lip balms to be using these like at
night or something plus then it's gonna
stay in my pillow case like it's just
ridiculous I'm getting rid of them and I
don't think they're yeah they still
smell fine I'm gonna go through and I
I'm sure i already did go through which
one's of these were like bad and which
ones were before I like give them to
people so whatever is actually like bad
i'm gonna get rid of and then whatever i
can pass on i'm gonna pass on so i don't
have to say that anymore that's just
what's going to happen i'm getting rid
of all my Fergie matt like velvet matte
lip colors i did really like these these
were even in a favorites video but
there's an issue with them and that
issue would be that they dry out and
then i'll shoot the one that doesn't
come out oh there it goes they break off
the base because i believe the matte
formula is just drawing and so yeah i
just have other lip pencils like this
like I have a lot of the NARS ones like
mini is that I bought last year for us
at and stuff so I don't really need
these I think almost all of them are
broken
like that and that's just like
ridiculous to me I don't care if they're
only two dollars and change like they
shouldn't do that and I bought them
while I've been here so I haven't had
them even a year yet so just annoying
i'm passing them off it's one of those
things too I have really straight away
from drugstore products not because
they're bad just because i find that
because they're at a cheaper price point
sometimes i'll go crazy and like buy the
whole collection instead of just buying
one thing and i just would rather have
save my money and buy less items but
nicer ones or something i'm really
really wanting than having five of these
I could have had almost like an arse one
you know what I'm saying so anyway I'm
getting rid of these and um yeah they're
just going in the trash because they're
all broken like they're useless oh
here's another one there's another shade
so yeah I have one single shadow in here
this is to face dirtbag shadow really
pretty it's really pigmented I've just
never used it and it needs to go i have
so many shades like this at palettes and
whatnot so i just have no attachment to
this one so it's going this is the bite
lip scrub this is the whipped cherry
exfoliant I've never really liked this
I've had it way too long it's probably
like expired yeah it doesn't smell quite
like it did it almost it's having a
little bit of a crayons and so
definitely throwing this one out I would
never repurchase this i don't really
like this the only lip scrub i like is
the one from lush and probably could
make it myself but I just like that one
so that's the one I'm going to
repurchase I like that you can eat it
off your lips the only other one I'd
want to try is the elf one that's like
on the stick exfoliating because that
one just seems really handy but this one
is stupid stupid wow how mature no but I
just don't like this one and it's
expired so it has to be thrown away this
is a bite lip pencil and it is in the
color pomegranate I think I got this for
vib rouge or something it's just very
glossy and I don't know if that's like
texture wise how it's supposed to be
it's so soft um but almost in like a bad
way I just don't like it i've never used
it the red is pretty but the formulation
or at least now the formulation it's
just too soft and messy and it just
makes me feel like it's bad i'm going to
throw
run away and I just don't ever use it I
have I like Matt deeper colors or Matt
Reds because they just stay on your lips
better so it's going this is a um Urban
Decay super saturated high-gloss lip
color it's from the Oz palette and I got
the auspol at way after it actually came
out it was on Urban Decay's website for
like twenty dollars so I was like yeah I
was so excited this is a really pretty
color one it's kind of old and it came
with the palette and it was already old
so I don't know I just feel a little
weird about it that way but it's very
sticky and glossy it's not like a matte
lip pencil and I just don't like that
formula either so it's not something I
would go on a pan so I'm getting rid of
it I'll probably throw that away this is
a shadow stick from pop beauty and this
is in the color bejeweled bronze that's
it there it's just nothing special it's
not even a warm bronze I just think it's
kind of ugly and I'm getting rid of it
I've never used to it and I got it from
all cosmetics wholesale this is a liner
from urban decay it's a 24-7 liquid
eyeliner I've just had this too long
I've never used it actually used it once
and it flaked off and then I just didn't
care to use it I like pen liners if I'm
doing a liquid wing and so I've just
never used it it's way too old and it's
going this one was a weird one this is
my NARS larger than life long-wear
eyeliner and this is the one I got from
the vib rouge this hall apply for my
birthday in January I don't remember
using this up but there is no product in
it and it's not like the products in
there I think it might have fallen out
at some point or I don't even know where
it is there's just nothing in here and I
know there was at one point i don't i
don't know so it's going in the trash
like i don't need that in my collection
this is a little urban decay mini this
is in the color 69 i got this in a
little ape sea bag and i don't use it
i've never used it i'm getting rid of it
yeah I have to lip butters in here I
have been to cluttering my lip butters
throughout each of these as well this
one is in the color wild watermelon and
this is in candy apple I just find that
i'm not using these i'm not using them
up I don't really like them they're not
quite there just a product I regret so i
might do a product i regret purchasing
video someone
requested that um at some point and
these would be in there so spoiler I
don't know anyway I just don't like
these I don't think that they're
hydrating enough but then the color
slips around because they are kind of
pigmented I just don't like him and I
feel like they were one of the first
things I really got into and wanted to
get all of them and whatever when I
first like started watching Beauty
videos years and years ago so I'm
getting rid of them I have a couple
different cream eyeshadows I'm getting
rid of this tart one this is in the
color smoked plum or plum smoke if I can
open it I'm just never going to use that
color especially not that much of a
cream shadow and I don't want it for a
base so I'm getting rid of it I'm
getting rid of benefits skinny jeans I
got this from all cosmetics wholesale so
one it's dried up like I don't know if
you can see around the edges and it also
just doesn't swatch nice these can dry
up and look like this but then be so
creamy still but this one isn't in it's
also this like strange gray color I got
this because Ingrid from his glamorazzi
like love this oh really really long
time ago and then when I saw it on the
site i was like oh missglamorazzi likes
it i'm gonna get it and i've never used
it it's just too dark for me I'm never
gonna wear that this is another cream
shadow this is from Maybelline I will
not purchase any more of these ever um
this isn't barely branded I wanted to
use this up for this year but it's just
too dry I cannot make this work on my
eyes I'm not going to try to revive it
with like mac fix+ it's just that psycho
and I'm done with it it's dried up I at
least hit pan on it that's good but I
obviously not going to finish this up
for the year because it's going in the
trash because i couldn't i would be like
giving myself wrinkles to try to put the
solids in the last cream shadow i'm
getting rid of this is for vincent longo
i took this from school to use in my
high-fashion cause more like on the face
and stuff not even by the eyes but i
didn't even use it for that it's just
gross i'm just what the heck was I
thinking by this is like a sample packet
but I had it with my makeup it's of
Urban Decay's primers there's like four
different ones I've never used it it's
going to go in the trash because it's
just so old but I've just never used it
and it's
in there this is a primer from Too Faced
um it's the candlelight one I have two
of these so I just don't need a second
one I tried to get rid of the one I felt
had the most product in it it's just not
something i've been using i do want to
use it but I just haven't been because
I've been using other things so I just
don't need two of them I decided to
finally let go of my next pigments I've
been keeping these because when you
swatch them they are so beautiful but
they just aren't pigments that I reach
for so I need to get rid of them I'm
getting rid of or Oh pearl um yellow
gold pearl walnut pearl mink pearl which
is so pretty and mocha pearl I you know
if it's so pretty why haven't I used it
so yeah I'm just getting rid of them
it's not that they're bad it's just one
of the first things i bought and
although that's kind of old I don't feel
like they're bad or anything that's not
part of my reason it's just I've ever
I've only used them a couple times like
i know i used the yellow gold ones when
I was really into yellow gold and that's
really it so I'm just gonna give them a
new home I just have other pigments I'd
rather use I'm getting rid of a lot of
Maybelline lipsticks and this and this
is just because I don't wear them this
one is actually one one of my most
recent purchases this is blushing bud
and it's really pretty I just I never
worn it since that video i bought this
it's one of my haul videos on my channel
I just have never used it so I'd rather
pass it along this one is in the smooth
taupe this is just too nude and I don't
really use it this is in blushing beige
again it's just kind of nude these are
pretty don't get me wrong I just don't
use them and I don't want them there I
just have other lip pencils that i use
it really like lip crayons and those are
the things that like go i'm excited to
use or liquid lipsticks and so I don't
want to have these sitting around this
is flawless fuchsia really pretty color
to turn your teeth yellow so getting rid
of that one and then last this is
ravishing Rose and that's it there I'm
again pretty colors but i'm not using
them so they're going not much left guys
there's not much left i'm getting rid of
this last glazed lip paint from le girls
i bought four of these when i first
moved here and it
rid of two and then now I got rid of and
then I got rid of one and now I have one
left and i'm getting rid of it I don't
like these these are not like the
two-faced ones that they aren't and I
just hate them like I hate this product
and I thought it was going to be so
awesome and it sucked and so what's
going bye-bye this is an hourglass
primer and I am getting rid of this
because it's bad I feel horrible about
that but it is it's something's wrong
with it um it's just not the same
consistency it's not quite the same
smell and it's going in the trash I
decided to just get rid of these little
benefit stains I had these and I was
holding on to them cuz they're so little
and I could use them up really fast but
I haven't I still have them so they need
to just go away and I don't want to use
them i don't have a desire to use them
and i don't want to put them in a
project pan if I'm just gonna hate them
the whole time so I'm just going to get
rid of them I don't think I've ever
really used them ever and it's one of
those things that I'm like excited to
get it's so twisted and then I have two
more little mini lipsticks and that's it
this one is the bite Beauty bite for vib
rouge this was the vib rouge I've never
used it I don't need that many reds I
don't wear that many reds so I'm getting
rid of it and then this one is I believe
the Makeup Forever birthday gift last
year and it is in the color and 9i think
it's pretty it's kind of a nice marsala
type of color but I don't want to work
on it so I'm getting rid of it I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I just like
to keep you guys up to date on where I'm
