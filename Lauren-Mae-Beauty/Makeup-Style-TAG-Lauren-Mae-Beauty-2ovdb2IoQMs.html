Lauren thank you so much for watching if
you were interested in this look I do
have a tutorial on it so I'm gonna leave
a link down below I know it's kind of
intense but yeah I was feeling it so
today's video is going to be the my
makeup style tag this was started by
ELISA I I'm gonna leave her channel link
down below I was tagged by Stephanie or
the Daisy curly and Danny beau here on
YouTube so I'm going to leave their
channels link down below I did not see
this or I've been seeing it pop up but
I've been out of town because I went out
of town from it birthday and then I saw
Elle's video yesterday so I'm gonna
leave LSE's video down below too and
then I've just been singing it pop-up
and then I realized it was I was
tagged so here we go yeah go check out
those people and let's just get into the
tag the first question is what kind of
eye primer do you use and why liquid eye
primer or a shadow stick so when it
comes to eyeshadow primer and honestly
not that picky currently I'm using the
elf two dollar like shadow lock primer
this is in the color sheer but they have
it in a bunch of other colors I think
this is okay I think it works fine for
the money it doesn't last like twelve
plus hours on me but it works and it
gets the job done I do always use a
primer though I prefer liquids like this
in my kit I do have Mac's painterly
paint-pot
and that one works really nice too but
for myself I usually go with the liquid
I'm not very picky I know everyone loves
the Urban Decay one and I think that
one's nice
I just don't ever spend $20.00 on the
primer I'm just I'm just cheap next
number two a there's two parts of this
question what color eyeshadow makes you
feel bold and pretty at the same time
now I can give you one guess as to what
color that is but yeah you probably all
guessed pink because it's pink
I love pink if you've watched some of my
videos in the past you've seen me do
like the pink in the brows usually it's
not quite as intense as this one is
today but my favorite pink is from the
electric palette it's the color savage
from Urban Decay I love it it's so great
the huda beauty want in the electric
obsessions palette is pretty nice too
and I really want to try the pink shadow
from sugarpill as well but yeah my
favorite one is the Urban Decay and then
the second part to that question to be
what eyeshadow color do you least like
to wear and why and I would say in
general doing something kind of dark
like this is something I'm not super
comfortable with I'm used to kind of
like lighter brighter looks instead of
darker looks i also green and blues I
mean I've been wearing a lot more blue
than normal lately for whatever reason
but green and blues are definitely
something that are a little bit more I
don't know they're it's out of my
comfort zone for sure they aren't warm
colors so I find that I don't gravitate
to them as much so I would say darker /
green blue colors number three do you
wear liquid or pencil eyeliner black or
brown liner I tend to go for a pencil
liner I don't usually wear liner on my
lids at all I have hooded eyes and so
when I add any liner to my lids
especially on the inner corner I just
eats up my whole eyelid space you can't
see I think of my eye shadow unless my
eyes are closed so I just like to
tightline which gives some definition to
the base of my lashes without covering
any lip space but if I'm gonna do like a
wing or something I do like liquid liner
so I don't know it just depends on my
preference that day but I would say
overall I'm a pencil liner girl and I
usually like to do brown actually and
black can look a little bit harsh on me
so Brown just kind of gives that depth
without looking too made-up I like
something a little bit more natural
every day I know you don't believe me
but I do like something a little bit
more natural every day number four
covergirl or Maybelline mascara come on
you know you are one way or the other I
honestly haven't used a drugstore
mascara and a really long time
that sounds so sloppy of me but it just
worked out where I've gotten the mascara
here or there and so yeah I haven't used
one in a long time my favorite mascara
at the moment is the Urban Decay
perversion and then if I had to pick
between covergirl or Maybelline I
remember really liking Maybelline /
covergirl I liked this one in like the
teal tube I think it's called like the
plushies or something like I remember
when that first came out I was so
excited and that was something I enjoyed
but I also remember the wand being super
bendy so I don't know I haven't tried it
in forever I haven't tried a covergirl
mascara in forever so if I had to pick
I'd probably pick up and maple
plus I use Maybelline Great Lash in my
kit so yeah Maybelline alright number
five if you could have your brows
permanently done or not wear any blush
for the rest of your life which would
you choose
as much as I would love to have my brows
done every single day what I'd be scared
to get the micro plaited if it looked
bad so I don't know about that but - I
just I don't want to not have blush so
I'd rather just do my eyebrows every day
and get to our blush it's tedious but I
love makeup so I'll deal with it
number six does your best friend or you
wear more makeup the most Awkward
question in here only because I don't
really have like a best girlfriend or
anything
obviously I'm married so I feel like I
don't know that goes without saying that
my best friend's my husband um but like
are my next best friend is a guy so
doesn't really work so if I had to go
off of like my just like I would just
call them friends I want call them like
best friends but my friends here in LA I
definitely wear the most makeup I'm a
makeup artist out of all of them um and
they're not they're just like in other
regards of the industry so yeah I would
say I am but when it comes to YouTube I
don't know I feel like we all love
makeup so we're all kind of even on that
one
I know that's like going around the
point but like you're making me feel
awkward with that best friend I've never
been like that I've never had I've had
like one I always have like one best
friend sometimes but I would say in the
past like five or six years I haven't
I've just had a good guy friend that's
like a mutual friend of me and Sam's
were like a trio and yeah and then I've
been finally making some friends here in
LA but I don't have anyone who's just
like a bestie you know next number seven
who taught you how to do makeup I was
originally taught through YouTube to do
makeup that's how I found my interest
and find my passion and loved it and
then I did go to makeup school here in
LA so yeah I've been taught
professionally it was a year-long
program and yeah I really enjoyed it I'm
really happy I did that so I have like
both I guess you could say I appreciate
what I learned through YouTube but I
also enjoy that I had a bit more of a
formal makeup training and I really
enjoyed that I know a lot about makeup
when it comes to prosthetics and just
regular beauty makeup kind of the
history of some makeup so yeah I have
kind of both alright number eight are
you a fan of cream products blush
bronzer contour etc why or why not
I feel like since I do makeup on other
people I just have an appreciation for a
ton of different products because I deal
with the ton of different skin types and
textures and ages and all of that so I
definitely see the use for all different
types of products when it comes to like
cream bronzer or blushes I personally
have been enjoying the milk cream
bronzer stick I really like that I don't
use it every single day but I think it
can give a really nice natural look to
the skin it just depends on the makeup
look that you're wanting to go for and
so yeah I think there's uses for all
different types of makeup products for
the everyday I don't use cream usually
at all especially not cream blushes but
I don't like hate them and I think
there's definitely use for them
number nine are you a project panner
what projects are you in right now I am
a project panner
and right now I'm having a finish 18 and
2018 it's a year-long product I'm doing
a lot of people are doing it and it's
just kind of items I want to move out by
the end of the year I'm gonna be doing a
project soon with a couple of ladies
here on YouTube which I'm excited about
and then I have like a summer project in
the mix as well so yeah I've quite a few
projects coming up I also do a project
pan that's like monthly which is called
my project use it up so I've painted
things left and righty
yeah I really like to try to use my
makeup or just get good use out of it
see if I like it and if I don't pass it
on and whatnot and last number-10
setting sprays do you believe in it
which is your holy grail I think it's
really funny cuz it makes it seem like
it's a magical creature but for setting
sprays I've just recently been getting
into them I just enjoyed the experience
of them I don't know how well they
actually set my makeup I do like them
for kind of making my finish less
powdery and I do like that I honestly
haven't tried a ton but my favorite is
the mac fix+
I love this for so many things I've
talked about it a lot but this is so
great for spring on your makeup after
you have put powder all over your face
it looks great I really like it for
highlight or - if you have a highlighter
that's looking a little metallic or
sitting on top of the skin just couldn't
help make it look just super just
listening but not powdery and I like
that I like this for foiling eyeshadows
it smells great I love it so I want to
like try a ton more I've been like
really into setting sprays and just
facial mists in general so you can
expect to see
some more on my channel all right and
that is the end of the tag thank you
guys so much for watching if you are a
creator I tagged you to do this and I
think tags are super fun I'm glad that I
feel like they're kind of coming back a
little bit it's so fun to talk about

questions so I hope you enjoyed thank
