Lauren this is going to be my top 5
makeup temptations for the month of
April now I mentioned doing something
like this in a video and everyone like
really really wanted to see it so I was
happy that you guys wanted to see it I
thought it would be something different
I'm not always hauling a ton of new
stuff although the video before this was
a haul but I'm trying really hard to not
buy everything you don't need everything
and everyone is different so just
because something new comes up doesn't
mean it actually like is going to work
for you in your collection and I think
as panners project panners we know that
and we're figuring that out as we try to
use things up that we've bought because
of hype or whatever the case may be so
these are the five items this month that
what they they're coming out this month
or I'm just like getting into them that
are kind of tempting me to actually like
pull my wallet out and and buy something
so number one would be Urban Decay's
collaboration with alice in wonderland
through the looking glass I was not into
makeup when the first pallet came out
that they did and I have only looked at
envy and envy at the people who have got
that palette in the past and I'm not
really tempted by the lipsticks because
I did see xsparkage swatch those i will
leave the link to that video down below
if you want to like see what they look
like cuz she got an early sneak peek of
them I'm if you haven't seen it the
lipsticks didn't swatch that well
especially the colors that I feel like
are the most different the blue and
purple and so I'm not even like a lip
person anyway so I only care about those
although the packaging is beautiful but
the eyeshadow palette I am just tempted
I'm so tempted and as a closer it gets
like when I first saw that they were
doing the collaboration I was like I'm
getting it i don't care oh I'm not
listening to anyone and then now that I
got my makeup geek shadows and I've been
seeing swatches and stuff I'm kind of
like more on the fence than like totally
a hundred percent like I'm getting it
one the packaging is a little bulky so
that's something that kind of like is
remember I'm not sure it's just like
more classic urban decay than like
making this palette and like maybe
making like a throwback to it or just
the fact that they're doing the second
collaboration being enough of a
throwback and then like keeping it nice
sleek packaging but I've just been
loving my makeup geek shadows and I get
to
those I gotta pick each one and i really
like like one of the red shades in there
and there are a few in there that are
really different but i'm just thinking
like if I don't order the Urban Decay if
I don't order that I'm probably going to
get makeup geek shadows kind of telling
myself like almost like one or the other
I don't eat bowls and the biggest thing
is I'm just scared i'm going to buy the
palette and then not actually use the
palette except for like two shades and
i'm just getting it kind of more as like
a collector thing so that's something
that I'm more on the fence on now but
something that definitely is like on
that list of like I'm checking out when
the release date is and like still
deciding if i'm going to stay up to or
the next item on my temptation list
would be the physicians formula butter
bronzer now i have seen so many people
rave about this product and physicians
formula does a lot of different browsers
and i feel like although the packaging
is really beautiful i usually i don't
know why i'm not tempted by them
probably because they're drug store but
they're still super expensive but this
one for whatever reason probably because
it smells like coconut like that already
is like okay i feel you i'm like i'm
down and it's for summer and i haven't
bought a bronzer in a really long time
plus they are Matt and I feel like
they're going to be really really good
bronzers for like a lighter skin tone so
it's not something that's going to maybe
turn to orange or just be too dark and
hard to work with at least that's what
everyone said and what I can determine
for my own self from the pictures i've
seen so that bronzer is definitely
something i don't know i just i just
really want it so if i ever see like a
tutorial or like a picture of it or like
a video that's like featuring it i'd
always click and watch it because i want
to like see it that's like how all these
products are like if i see them in a
video I'm like okay or like if I see
them in a thumbnail I'm like definitely
clicking but that's something I want
there are two shades I'm not sure I
haven't done like a ton of research into
it because I'm trying not to like really
get on sites and like start adding
things to carts and whatnot because I
find that I usually just like go over
the edge and buy it anyway but
I think both of them are going to be
beautiful so that is something that I've
definitely been putting on my list if
you know if it's limited edition let me
know in the comments because I'm not
sure if it's limited edition I hope now
the next item number three that's on my
temptations list is a pigment from
sugarpill and it is the color lumi I
know a lot of people don't like pigments
and I find that sometimes I don't use
them as much as I should myself but they
are so beautiful there's something about
a pigment that is so much easier to work
with if you want just like really
intense pigmentation or like a duochrome
effect that a pigment can do better than
a pressed eyeshadow I don't know what it
is but it's true and Leumi is just such
a perfect shade to really light colored
shadow with like a white and it has that
you're a doesn't to it it's like me I
think it'd be so so pretty in the inner
corner and that's something that I'm
noticing in my sweet peach kind of like
inspired tutorial i use the shade Oh
natural from bare minerals and although
that's a really pretty shade it just
doesn't have the brightness like I want
that like almost white base so i can
still have the brightness but i want
still that do a chrome effect and that
is going to give it to me i've seen so
many pictures on Instagram with people
using it over the lips as highlights
like doing creature makeup so pretty and
I want it the next one on list probably
comes as no surprise because it's makeup
geek shadows since getting my first 12
that I ordered by myself I do have the
original Ten I believe oil shadows and I
do really like them but I bought those
because of one the hype and Sam bought
them for me for Christmas so it wasn't
like I picked them out and I don't know
it's just like my first experience like
with makeup geek by myself anyway um so
I was on the site and after getting them
I just I want more so I'm really looking
at tiki hut as a che taiwan I really
want I believe it's coca-cola it's like
a red matte brown shade really want that
poppy looks beautiful Morocco looks
beautiful I don't have any of the
classics like frappe or creme brulee or
cocoa bear beaches and cream any of
those so I would like to get some more
makeup geek and just kind of continue to
build up my collection something else I
kind of wanted for makeup geek too were
the
duochrome pigments but they are all sold
out and I don't know why that is like
are they actually sold out or have they
not restocked them since like the
original launch because they looked so
beautiful and I think it's just strange
that every single one is sold out so I
really hope that they're like stopping
making them cuz they looked so pretty
and i would love to order some but it's
kind of sad to me i don't know i just i
just find it kind of weird that they
were all sold out and it just didn't
feel like they were coming back let me
know if you know anything about that too
the last item that I have here on my
list of temptations would be basically
just cushion foundations in general I
have been just intrigued by I know
there's a couple from the drugstore
there's a physician's formula there's
the l'oreal one and then there are a ton
of like asian beauty brands who have
them and then I even know that some
other brands are like copying the Asian
brands and having them so just in
general I just want to try it the only
thing that's kind of holding me back is
one they're all expensive it doesn't
matter where you buy them from it's
gonna cost you like definitely over $15
so that's a little you know
disappointing definitely because you're
getting a little like definitely less
product it's gonna be half the product
in a regular traditional foundation I
still kind of I'm just intrigued it's
just something different I just want to
like know what it's like to work with it
and want to see how it works on my skin
I do have like combination oily skin so
I know the looming one is meant to be
like Dewey and luminous and I have heard
if you have oily skin it might not work
so I don't know it's just something I
kind of want to look into and maybe kind
of try out maybe I can do it too from
like a place where I can return it if I
don't like it those are my top five
temptations I kind of wanted to keep it
short and simple and just my top fives
unless there's something way more over
that for a specific month I just thought
it wouldn't be too much where I'm like
may be tempting you guys too much into
getting stuff but enough where I can
just show you or let you know about the
things that kind of have like you know
they're on my radar like I see you could
deal on them or if someone I really love
is really really talking them up that I
might you know I might give it I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
some of your temptations down below in
the comments and I will see you in the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
