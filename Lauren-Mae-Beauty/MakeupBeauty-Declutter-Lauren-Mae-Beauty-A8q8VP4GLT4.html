that's Lauren I'm doing a vlog style
type of thing basically I'm just not
trying to show my face but we're gonna
declutter I wanted to show you what's in
this bag my mom is coming into town
she's actually flying in today and I
want her to be able to go through this
stuff and take what she wants so I
wanted to show you what I'm getting rid
of before that if I mention any videos
they will all be listed down below if
you want to check them out other than
that let's just get into it because this
is a lot of stuff and I'm just gonna go
really randomly pick stuff out show you
guys what I'm getting rid of and why
first off the top this is a conditioner
from alterna it's super dusty I was
trying to use this up last year in my
finish something by summer 6 by summer
obviously that didn't happen and I'm
just over it so I'm gonna be getting rid
of it I'll probably end up throwing this
one away I have a couple of pallets off
the top this is the Maybelline blushed
nudes palette and this is the bone
Appetit palette both of these just
aren't the quality that I want and I
just have better stuff in my collections
so I'd rather see if someone else wants
them those are both in my products I
regret buying video if you haven't
checked it out I'll leave it linked I
feel like a lot of stuff in this it's
going to be from that video but this is
the Rimmel stay matte foundation well my
voice described this is the Rimmel stay
matte foundation I'm gonna be getting
rid of that this is the sugar bomb blush
by benefit I just don't like that so I'm
getting rid of it this is something I've
never even opened it's from derma and
it's the purifying 2:1 charcoal mask I
actually already have one of these
unopened as well I got two from
generation Beauty last year and I've
never used either one so I figured I
don't need a backup I have a couple
candles here I'm gonna be getting rid of
these are just not my favorite sentence
I have a lot of candles from Bath and
Body Works these are so dusty and I need
to work through them this year but I
don't want to work through ones I just
don't like um this one's watermelon
lemonade I just don't really like that
side and then this one's papaya sunrise
this smells okay but I just had other
tropical scents that I liked better and
didn't want to burn this one another
thing from Bath and Body Works this is a
country apple body lotion I haven't used
this or anything I think I got it for
Christmas but I don't use body lotion I
have my silly sponge here that I'm gonna
be passing on I also have this hi-def
spray this is probably something I'm
just gonna have to throw away because no
one I know will
want to use this so I have like a ton of
little samples I'm gonna try to collect
them all so you guys can just see the
mass amount
I never go through samples so there's
just no reason for me to have them this
is from a recent order at Ulta I like
well does reward system better but I
hate that you cannot pick your sample
that sucks these are all the samples I
found so I'm gonna be passing those on I
don't need them I really hope
everything's in focus I have a manual
focus and because of the angle it's hard
to have like this in focus and just down
here in focus so forgive me please if it
isn't this is like kind of random but I
have some stencils and the CDs for this
like glitter tattoo kit that I have I
kept on the glitter but I don't want
this I'm never gonna use them next I
have this like kit that I'm gonna be
getting rid of this is actually from a
Dan glam and they sent me this stuff I
do like this system I think it works in
whatever but as you guys know I don't
really do my nails a ton I'm finally
trying really hard to use regular
polished and although this is pretty
fast and stays on your nails a really
long time it's just not something that I
want to do right now like I don't want
to polish up a long time I want to try
and apologize in my collection and since
I spent money on those polishes I
actually want to use those and enjoy
them then use this so I will be passing
this on to someone there's probably
gonna be a couple more to polish things
like that in here like look at this this
is so crazy I know it's out of focus for
you I'm sorry these are two dermablend
leg and body covers I kept these because
I thought maybe I'd use them but they're
too light and pink tone for me so I'm
gonna be passing those on my mom I have
a ton of these maybelline quads that I
decided to declutter I've had so many
for so long and I just decided to be
real with myself these are all of them
there's so many let me count them up
there's 18 of them here stacked up and
getting rid of all 18 of these I do like
the quality of these I just never used
on so yeah I just went on like a weird
buying spree of getting all of them so
this one is and
Violent Femmes this one's spirited see
this is taupe temptress take it off
see sprite sapphire stylus covetable
cobalt virtually violet which I haven't
pan on that one but I'm gonna get rid of
it this one's violet vault fall
temptation this is olive martini which
is a really pretty wine I do like that
one autumn dream desert fantasy and
green with fashion I can't believe I'm
not done telling you the names yet a
natural shock enchanting memoral fair at
all taupe cheese and electric emerald so
I'm gonna be getting rid of all those
I'll let my mom take what she wants and
I don't know what I'm gonna do for us I
also decided to get rid of some of my
wet'n wild shadows this is a six pan
shadow palette from the summer
collection last year I think this is
embrace obscurity I love California roll
and I bought this one just because I was
buying the other one but I've never used
this and I just don't like it that much
plus I have so many singles honestly
part of the reason I'm okay with getting
rid of all of these is because I would
never use these to dupe palette because
I like moving my single shadows around
to make it look like the palette so
there's just no reason for me just to
keep a bunch of drugstore eye shadows
that I can dupe with nicer shadows in my
collection that I spent more money on so
and then these are the three palettes so
I have comfort zone I know it's
everyone's favorite but I honestly don't
know how many times they've even used
this so getting rid of it this one's
nice it's drinking a glass of shine the
neutrals over here are really nice
especially this orange e shade but I
just use my other shadow so and then
this one is walking the red carpet I hit
pan on this shade last year but I'm
beginning rid of that too this is like a
pretty big breakthrough for me because I
was holding on to these shadows for a
really long time but I'm feeling really
confident in what I have and I'm happy
to let these go okay kind of pulled out
all the makeup that was left in there I
think so I have two lip balms I'm going
to be getting rid of this is the wet and
wild one for my first impressions that I
didn't like this is from my products
buying video people actually were in
that but I just don't like these sound
effects mom I have another little eye
shadow quad this is from Lancome I
believe yeah Lancome really really
pretty I love this shadow this is
actually one of my dupes for something
in the peach palette sweet peach palette
from cute face but I just have other
things and I have a color from makeup
geek that's really similar to it so I'm
gonna pass it on they don't use it that
often to keep it this is another quad
I'm gonna be passing on from Eden
minerals I get a beauty brand spotlight
with this and I just didn't I couldn't
make them work it's a really pretty quad
the quality is really nice but it just
wasn't working for me so I'm gonna pass
it on to my mom I think she'll really
like it this is a single shadow from
Sonia Kashuk I was actually gifted this
from autumn but I just don't use it I
used it and a look once and I do think
it's an I don't know I like it because
it's like a soft black gray charcoal
color but I just have other things in
palette so this color since it's not
something just extravagant I'm gonna get
rid of this is another single shadow I'm
gonna pass on this is from Catrice and
Heather from love Heather and actually
pass this on to me this is a pretty
color in the pan but it doesn't quite I
don't know I just have other things like
it you know and I like it but I'm gonna
get rid of it I don't think I'm gonna
use it and I'd rather someone else use
it I have quite a few different blushes
to show you guys I decided to pass on
these to Rimmel blushes this is a super
old one like a cult classic this is
Santa Rosa it looks like a nothing blush
but it does have a nice color on the
cheeks I just don't use it anymore and I
feel like the only reason I was keeping
it was because it's like this cherished
old favorite but I'm gonna get rid of it
this is what I got a fall cosmetics
wholesale and I've never even used it so
I'm getting rid of it I have two blushes
from Tarte that I'm gonna get rid of
these are both in different sets for
holidays this is the color entertain it
just has hard pan on it so I just don't
to deal with that and then this other
one here is Mirage and it's kind of like
a weird shimmery light highlight blush I
don't know I just didn't want it
pass it on to more blushes this one's
from Tarina tarantino now I love
Neapolitan Lane but this is just not my
type of pink it's just too basic pink
for me so I'm gonna pop that on its
really good quality a nice blush just
not my color and then this is one from
babyface I hauled this in a agen Beauty
Hall I think last year a really pretty
color but it's just too white based so
it just comes out to like choppy on my
face and there's just not enough color
payoff but I was so cute that's why I
bought it but it just doesn't work as an
actual blush so it's not worth keeping
I'm getting rid of some pigment sample
jars these are all from gorgeous
cosmetics they have really pretty
pigments I just don't use these and I
wouldn't use these on clients so I'm
gonna pass them this is my benefit high
beam it's like a little mini I'm gonna
be getting rid of this I've had this way
too long it's gonna be thrown in the
garbage
I do actually really like this highlight
color I think it's really pretty on the
skin I just don't use it enough and
since this is old I need to get rid of
it I wouldn't mind having another little
sample just to randomly have or for my
kit or something but but that one needs
to go I have two eyeliners this one's
from Urban Decay perversion you guys
know I don't like this for my products I
regret buying I'm gonna be throwing this
in the trash this is Maybelline's
lasting drama white eyeliner this sucks
and I'm going to be maybe giving it to
my mom if she doesn't want it I'm gonna
throw it away this is a lip product that
was in my products I regret buying it's
the lilac shock lack lip stick I just
don't like the color of this it's too
pink and not as Mafi as it should be
plus it turns hot pink on my lips drop
the day this is an unopened covergirl
lash box but this is so old I don't even
feel comfortable using it even though
it's sealed so this will be thrown away
some tulle items this is a Kevyn Aucoin
brush I was given this from a friend and
it's really soft and nice but I've never
used it since I got it and I'm gonna
pass it on these are two brushes from my
Laura Geller hall that I won't use so my
mom would probably take those and then
last for like tools I believe these are
two of the Beauty Blender sponges the
micro-mini and this is the blush sponge
I just don't feel like there's a need
for small sponges like this I have
another sponge from the Physicians
Formula instant ready concealer like it
came with it I'm also getting rid of
that it's just the Beauty blunder does
it all like the shape of it works for
everything so these are just there's
just no need I'll look this cute little
pin I love my body I'm getting rid of it
it's just water like I feel like so many
brands give you stuff to just like
clutter up your life oh my gosh we're
getting close okay I have some nail
polish things here so these are a couple
more of those gel nail polishes that go
with that kit so I'm going to be getting
rid of those these are two polishes from
my polish picks that I didn't like
something to be getting rid of those if
my mom wants her this is just a random
polish I had that I don't want to
mooning rid of that too and then last
for polishes oh my gosh my hands look
crazy these are not quite polishes but
they're from ciaté they're like little
mini caviar beads I got these in a set
like one of the holiday sets and I'm
never used in once and I know I got that
set like over three years ago so you
know I think it's it's safe to say I'm
not gonna miss them this is like the
little spout that comes with it getting
rid of all that my mom just texts me she
says she's going to the airport right
now I am so excited
whew I've cleared out the rest of what
was in that bag so let's just finish it
off this is a body scrub from toca I
hate this I don't know why I hate it so
much but it's just oily and gross I just
don't like it I don't want to finish it
look I don't so I'm gonna get rid of it
these are two bath and Bodyworks hand
sanitizers the reason I'm getting rid of
these is because they have glitter in
them so I mean that's irritating I
cannot use these on set even if the
smell is filed
I cannot just have random glitter
particles on my hands or like an
interview
people are gonna have glitter on their
face while they're talking and that does
not work this is a little mini candle I
have something put my fingers in it like
seven times while digging in that bag
it's really small and I just don't want
to burn a small candle it just seems
like a way so I'll let someone else burn
that this is a nail strip set Sam works
for a hotel he does like audio-visual in
the hotel and the one he
that is really close to the Fox building
so he's able to see like celebrities and
host things that have a lot of goodie
bags and like top chefs and just a lot
of really cool events go there so I'm
this is in one of the goodie bags and he
was like oh I got this for you but I
don't want that thanks Sam I love you
but now and then this is top brass from
benefit it's a cream shadow this is so
old I wanted to use it up by last year
and I didn't and I like these shadows so
much but it's just too old and I know
that I'm not going to be able to finish
it anytime soon so I'm gonna get rid of
it okay the last items here are things
that were in my makeup kit so for school
I had to buy we didn't have to but I
chose to buy a makeup kit and these are
some of the products that were in there
these are the La Femme these are like
water activated eyeliners yeah no well a
sealer use like it's a cake eyeliner so
use like a sealer to start it up no one
uses that that's like old-school and
then I have some foundations these are
the picture-perfect foundations honestly
I think it's a shame that they even give
these to us because these are not very
good quality and that kit is expensive I
did already scoop out some of this
product though just in case like this is
a super dark color which is handy to
have because you just never know if you
might need to mix it in with something
so I'm gonna be getting rid of those I
just don't want to keep the extra
clutter around and the more I upgrade my
kit I know I'm not gonna need these
okay that is everything guys I hope that
this declutter wasn't too horrible with
like you know everything being out of
focus or anything like that I just
wanted to rush through this because
again she's coming this because my mom's
coming tonight and I didn't know how to
like pick through things and then not be
able to show you a good declutter so I
hope you guys are having a great day and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
