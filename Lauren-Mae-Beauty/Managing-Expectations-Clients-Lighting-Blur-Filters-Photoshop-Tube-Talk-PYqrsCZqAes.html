insolent thank you so much for watching
this is going to be another tube top
video I have a whole series on my
channel dedicated to just talking about
different subjects different things
mostly in the beauty community but just
kind of a place for me to talk about
topics that might be a little bit more
controversial or just you know ignite a
discussion so that's what I try to do
with these I want this to be a place
where we can just have genuine
discussions so even if you don't agree
with me or don't agree with someone else
in the comments it's totally fine to
express your opinion as long as it's
respectful I feel like we should all be
open to other people sides into
listening and the way that you talk to
someone is nicely so that's it I will
leave the other videos linked down below
if you want to check them out I wrote a
few notes out just so that I wouldn't
forget anything but we're going to be
talking about managing expectations and
to me this relates not only as a makeup
artist in managing other people's
expectations of me doing their makeup
but also managing expectations as a
consumer there is a lot of photoshopping
and filtering and blurring as well as
lighting that goes into these videos and
I think it's important that we're just
aware of it and don't like what we see
on other people and what they present to
us make us think that that is reality
and if we are not meeting up to that and
then then we are either untalented or
the product suck or we're ugly or
whatever it is that can be disappointing
about that I just wish there's more
transparency that's like my favorite
word but when it comes to things like
that that can be deceiving if we know
about it at least we can keep that in
the back of our minds but it's happening
so often and so much that people aren't
thinking constantly like oh that's fake
or oh that's photoshopped or oh that's
not real life because it's not being
presented that way it's being presented
as real life and when you're getting
that from multiple sources on every day
it's hard to not believe it it's just
hard so oh I'm not even in focus if I go
back here sing it I guess I'll have to
not be that relaxes I want to stay in
focus but I want to start off with just
managing expectations when it comes to
being a makeup artist this is something
that Wayne Goss made a video about and I
will leave a link down below I thought
it was just very
very well said and I noticed that this
is just true when you're working on
someone or going to work with someone
just managing what they're expecting
from you
makeup is so widely available tutorials
are online we're all kind of these mini
beauty experts it's how I got into
makeup is because of YouTube so I love
it I make content I'm a creator but it's
so widely available that people are
getting really good at doing their
makeup they know all the little tips and
tricks and they try different techniques
and they kind of mastered how to do
their own face so sometimes when
someone's really really good at doing
makeup and they come to you and want you
to do their makeup for me it can be a
little bit not intimidating but I can
know up front like they're not going to
be happy with my work on them because
they already are so good at doing their
face and this is the first time I'm
doing it even though I am a pro makeup
artist and I am you know more
experienced in doing other people's
faces I know about corrective contouring
and all of these different things to
work with different people skin tone eye
shape face shape you know finding ways
to bring out the features and kind of
recede features that maybe aren't so
pleasant I know how to do that but it's
still my first time working on you and
if you've already got how you love your
brows done if I do them a different way
you're not going to like it you know and
so managing expectation and letting
people know like hey you already do your
makeup pretty awesome
until managing the expectation at the
beginning of that consultation or
whatever it is can only be a good way to
kind of at least set expectations right
and let them know like hey you're really
freaking good you might be better at
this than me and that by no means is
making the artist seem less of an artist
or as talented as it are it's just the
fact of the matter and don't get me
wrong there are plenty of women in this
world that don't do their makeup on the
other day who aren't obsessed with
YouTube who don't know about tips and
tricks and they just know about
contouring because it looked that big it
finally got to them so a lot of times on
set that's what I'm dealing with too and
a lot of times they want something more
natural they don't want the whole full
glam with the wing
the lashes and the brows and the lips
like they don't want that they want
something more natural now that's just
something I just want to say I just
think it's an important thing to learn
as an artist so that way you can just
you yourself can have a better time
doing someone's makeup but this got me
thinking as well as the reddit subgroup
what does it makeup Beauty chit chatter
Oh Frick I don't even know the name of
it I will leave it link down below if
you want to check it out but it's a
subreddit I think we call it a separate
I don't even know I'm not really like a
blog person or a reddit person I
literally go on reddit to look at this
blog I love it
I think that there are some really
intelligent people on there I find that
I really get along with the different
rule that they have and it's interesting
to see other people's opinions on
different subjects going on so if you're
into more I don't want to call it drama
channel because I really think they do a
better job of being more respectful than
just being straight-up drama but if
you're into more of that type of beauty
world I think you would like this right
so I will leave a link down below anyway
there was a post about people using
filters or something like that it's
crazy how often we see people in these
filters and that a lot of the times even
if we know it even if we know like Oh at
the shelter we can still be totally
still almost desiring that look and
desiring the way that they look and
thinking that they look so pretty and
how do they do that when it's like a
snot skin that's not even skin and now
I'm talking about a lot there are a lot
of things that go into it it can be
filtered and videos it can be like
photoshopping photos for Instagram or
just putting the blur on which I'm not
saying is bad I think that they can do
whatever they want in some regards there
are some cases I think that I've just
totally messed up especially for photos
it's like all photos that you see in
magazines maybelline ads all of that
it's touched up and they're selling me
makeup and I don't think that it's right
and we talk about all the time how this
photoshopping and all of that is kind of
adding to us having a low self-esteem a
low body image because we're seeing
things that we can't
even emulate even the people in the
photos can emulate it because it's fake
they've manipulated the photo to look a
certain way
whether that's clearing up pimples on
the skin or making lines with sharper
than they are or making someone look
thinner than they are it's just not real
life and we're trying to strive for
something that just isn't even real but
when it comes to the beauty gurus on
YouTube doing it or even on their
Instagram I I just think that it's
important to kind of again in a similar
vein using that manage your expectations
just being more aware of the fact like
these photos are fake now I'm not trying
to call people out like Mac Daddy I
think that's his name I don't follow him
but I do see his photos because other
brands will post his photo I'm not
saying that he has bad skin in person or
that it looks bad but I'm saying in his
photos it is so photoshopped I don't
even know how people can post that up on
their site and be like look at their
flawless skin or look at his awesome
makeup again not thing is make it been
than great it is like it looks nice but
it is so filtered and so photoshopped
and blurred out that there isn't
absolutely no texture on the skin it
just it's just blur it's just it's just
smooth that's not real life you know and
I think it's kind of sad that brands are
promoting that when it's like it's too
much like when you can I can tell it
just screams up all I can see when I
look at is a screaming
Photoshop to me I just wish it wasn't
like that
so much and that's like a very extreme
example but so many people are
constantly trying to meet this level of
perfection that they that isn't possible
and then they're promoting that to their
number followers and promoting that to
their audience and it's not even
attainable and there's no disclaimer
about it it's not saying like hey my
skin was enhanced doing this they're
just doing it and so when you watch
their videos you're sitting there
thinking like oh how is their skin look
that great how how come my skin doesn't
look that great and it's like your skin
could never look that great because it's
not true
and that is something that I have a hard
time with just in general and a very
very honest
I'm honest to a fault I really like
transparency and I just can't I can't
stand that so many people are watching
these videos or looking at these
Instagram photos and thinking that that
is what they look like in real life
again I don't want to like shade any
beauty gurus I think that they have a
lot of pressure on themselves also to
look perfect and that can drive them to
maybe make this decision and I think
that that sucks and is super sad for
them like if they feel like this is
something they have to do to please
their audience or you know to continue
the status of being this beauty guru I
think that also is just like so sad and
horrible now part of the reason that
this comes up is because in that reddit
now that I'm remembering it was a video
of someone doing a full face of makeup
and it was heavier makeup but it still
was like nowhere near what some people
used to do like a full face glam and she
had quite a bit of highlighter on and
all that which is what a lot of people
do and what a lot of people like but it
wasn't blurred it was in HD and she
showed it and it still looks really good
for as much makeup as you put on it
looked really good
it just looked real it looked like skin
it wasn't overly edited it wasn't you
know put any blurs or too much lighting
or anything where you couldn't quite
make out those details and she got a lot
of backlash for it in the comments
section and that's so sat and to me
that's like showing potentially why
these beauty gurus do it so I don't
think it's just necessarily to be evil
that they do it it's like they're also
in a huge public eye and are expected to
look perfect all the time it's six
cycles that's all I got to say you know
it's like we want them to be perfect and
we hold them on this pedestal so then
when they don't we bash them down
there's a little done did then when they
don't we bash them down but then we're
off to bashing them if they do it
because they're like that's not true
especially Instagram the images look
beautiful a lot of the time so I get it
like just the beauty of the image but I
wish that it was disclosed in some way
just so that so that people who are
younger or people who aren't aware can
become aware and just know when they
look at it like oh it's kind of like
think of this
you get for school it's like it'll be
the planet like some type of solar
system and then they'll be like a whale
you know like it's a cool image
it's like sick whatever like we all know
whales aren't out in space swimming
around you know similar to that to me I
don't know why that like came to me but
that's the comparison that I asked you
guys I think this also ties in a bit
with like lip injections and body
modification in any way when it comes to
plastic surgery or even hair extensions
something as simple as that I'm not
trying to hate on anyone who does any of
that I I think people should do what
they want to do if they want to change
their body and they are of sound mind to
do that I think that they should do
whatever they want to make them happy
that being said I think that is also
important to manage your own
expectations when you are trying to
maybe recreate a tutorial or a look or
buy a lipstick
everyone has lip filler in their lips
and they have beautiful applet it look
great a lot of them especially if they
haven't been overdone they just look so
good you know and a lot of people don't
have those lips naturally so you have to
manage your expectations that like
you're you're not going to look like
them and and just so you know to they
look like that because they chose to
look like that and you could choose to
look like that if you want to but do not
let that get you down about yourself or
yeah I think like on your own body
positivity because these things aren't
natural they've changed themselves to
make them look that way which again no
hey do what you want
it looks beautiful there's no denying
that a lot of these people I don't want
if they look better because I think that
everyone can be beautiful and natural is
not necessarily bad but I think that
like yeah your lips look great for a lip
swatch I just I just wish that some of
these things that go along with the
beauty community weren't perpetuating
these like thoughts of like lesser than
in regular regular people I don't even
know what that means but in people who
you know are just a normal consumer and
aren't you know on Instagram showing
their their lip swatches and this and
that I know a lot of youtubers are
really open about their lip injection
and I know some of them get a lot of
hate but I don't think that it's as big
as it used to be I don't even know how
much was ties in and how related
everything is I'm just kind of talking
on tangents as they strain along I think
it's just important for us to when we
are bombarded by these images when we're
bombarded by these videos with all these
fake elements to it that we at least
just come back and remind ourselves like
oh this is why that looks like that and
this is why their hair looks perfect
it's because they have a bunch of fake
extensions in and this is why their skin
looks perfect with all of that product
on it because the lights aren't you know
blowing things out and they have a
filter over their video or whatever it
is at least knowing it can help us be
just more aware of like real stuff and
hopefully not let something like their
beauty you know make us feel bad about
ourselves and what we see in the mirror
because I know that it can be like I
feel like sometimes like I have so much
texture my skin and a lot of people in
real life will tell me like your skin so
pretty and in my head I'm like it's so
texture I have so many pores and all
this stuff but so does everyone because
that's what skin looks like so anyway I
hope this was enjoyable
I have one last thing to say I really
wish people weren't using filters on
their videos I already feel like life
alone can make you look so much better
like think about when you're taking a
photo for Instagram or just test photo a
general lighting and everything if you
have up lighting looks horrible if
you have like lighting from the side and
everything's dark it looks like grainy
and crappy so and then when you get
really good lighting you know how you
look you're like damn I look good in
this lighting and so in a video it can
be very very similar even on set
sometimes the makeup I'm like oh gosh I
don't really like like it maybe or
whatever but then on screen and under
license on the green screen it looks
great it looks really nice on camera
because they have the nice light it's
professionally wood I feel like you know
it's meant to make them look the best
that they can but the filters are just
something that I wish people weren't
using I know that a lot of cameras just
come with filters and I'm not saying
I've never used like a tiny bit of blur
on my own camera on some of my photos I
just sucks you know like it just sucks
that their entire video is like a fake
thing like I can
like images on just so much more
forgiving because I'm down for a
beautiful image but for video I feel
like video is trying to replicate real
life you know I just am not very
comfortable with the idea that so many
people are doing that and then on top of
that for me so much of YouTube is a
commercial and I know that again
commercial and it's tough and you know
are fake but we don't like commercials
because of that and YouTube has turned
into a lot of the time you know selling
in a lot of ways and so if you're trying
to do a first impressions or talk about
a foundation and you're constantly using
a filter on your face I just think that
that potentially can be looked at are
like false advertising because I'm not
actually seeing what the foundation
looks like on your skin I'm not even
seeing that so I'm buying a foundation
on false ideas of what it's going to do
my skin because of what you're showing
so I definitely think when it comes to
review videos when it comes to like
first impressions or really anything
that's like showing the foundation
anything more than just like sitting
there talking about products with a face
already done I think it's important to
think about what you're doing by having
that filter on and talking about a
foundation or some type of product and
showing it in the light that isn't
necessarily real life or true because
YouTube has turned into a place that is
selling you know there's no way around
that that's why beauty gurus get PR they
don't just get it for free because it's
to you know make money into selling and
to get their product out there so anyway
those are just on my thoughts let me
know what yours are down below I hope I
touched on everything I hope I made
sense I think I say that in every video
but I just get on can just and start
talking and then I'm like there's no one
here to like I feel like keep it on
track so than I just can kind of go out
into my own world so thank you so much
for watching let me know if you have any
topics down below what you want me to
talk about next in my to talk and I will
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
