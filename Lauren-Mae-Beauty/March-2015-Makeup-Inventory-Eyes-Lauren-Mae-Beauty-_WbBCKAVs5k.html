my makeup inventory for I products I'm
just going to say that I have a lot a
lot a lot of eye products a lot of my
products they are definitely my favorite
thing I love I shadow palettes I'm an
eyeshadow palette junkie if a new pilot
comes out I'm usually like first in line
like ready to go and get that palette
I'm going to be letting you guys know
the numbers that i have again I'm not
going to be showing you the products in
this video letting you know just like
what I have and then what my goals are
again not necessarily for this year but
just in general if I had like you know
my dream number what that would be
obviously I love makeup so it's going to
be a lot so um yeah be prepared and
let's just get straight into it first
thing that I have here our brows so I
have nine brow products and goal lies
I'd like seven or eight I don't think
nine is too crazy I do love my brows and
I just I don't have any browse if I
don't put product on them so I have kind
of recently experimented with things
other than just powder or just Anasazi a
brow Wiz I don't know like I don't want
to get too crazy and have like a million
brow products that I'm trying to work
through like I don't ever have to say
that I'm working through bra products
but I do like to potentially change up
the color the lightness or the darkness
or the town and things like that seven
or eight is my goal in that eye shadow
singles I have 40 eyeshadow singles and
I didn't set a goal for myself only
because I do love I shadow and I just I
don't know I don't want to limit myself
like i said i don't know how much I'm
into like having like a limit
unnecessarily things especially if you
love them like this is what I love so at
the moment I'm not putting a limit on
that I just again want to make sure that
I go through those eyeshadows and if I
haven't used it do I still want it
should i get rid of it should I pass it
on to a friend or should I pull it up on
start using it again or put it in a
project pan I just want to make sure i
love them but I don't have a limit
eyeshadow duos I have four and I i am
putting a little bit on that just at ten
just because they're just not a form
that i usually use like I'm not like oh
let me reach for my duo it's either like
a big palette or single
for me I don't want more than 10 I
really really am thinking about that I'd
like more than ours ones so that's why I
gave myself a little bit of room but
yeah dude was just you know I'd rather
just have singles or a bigger palette
for small pullets now I can't smell
pallets as anything with six or less
shadows in them and I have 38 of those I
put a cap on it at 40 I just don't reach
through little eye shadow palette as
much as I do big ones so I'd rather just
not waste my money on a bunch of little
ones like especially from the drugstore
I don't want to waste ten dollars here
and seven dollars here on little ones
when I know that I'm a big big palate
person I'd rather have the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette and save that
money and had it there I definitely
think it could maybe go through and get
rid of some by that'll be for a
different a different video and and
stuff but I definitely don't want more
than 40 of those four large pallets I
have so that's anything with seven
chatters or more I have 49 large pallets
now I know that's crazy and I'm not even
gonna give excuses except for that I
just love makeup and I shot is my
favorite so we're just gonna stop it
there I just love them they're just
beautiful and I'm in love so I did put a
limit on there if a pallet comes out I
don't want to feel guilty for getting it
I want to enjoy it and feel good that I
got it obviously I want to do my
research make sure it is something I'm
going to love have like kind of
questions put in place to make sure that
it's something i'm actually going to
enjoy but i don't want to just buy like
another neutrals and not love it more
than what I have or something like that
but no limit that's it that's like I've
said cream eyeshadows no I have this
split up between pots and stick so for
pots I have 12 potted ice cream
eyeshadows and I'd like only nine to 10
I also one of the goals it's not like a
number goal I'd like to kind of get rid
of all my Maybelline tattoos and get
different ones if I'm gonna have them I
really love the benefit creaseless cream
eyeshadows those are my favorite formula
I've tried so far and I don't I just
want to buy the Maybelline ones anymore
they just dry out I the texture on room
is at my favorite and I'd rather just
invest in something else that I don't
have to rush through and I know that it
will be my clutch over a long time yeah
but nine to ten
I don't want more than that just because
it's a cream product and it can go bad
and it's hard to get through it be hard
to get through 10 of them anyway I
definitely don't want more than that
cream eyeshadow now in the stick form I
have 13 when I made this and I don't
know more than 15 I think that gives me
enough of a mix between brands that I
want to try out and colors that I want
to try out to have like a variety but
nothing too overboard or anything like
that my goals 15 pigments I have 20 and
I don't have a goal I've been really
into pigments lately and I just think
they're great and you can usually get
pigments in the colors and finishes and
things wait like way cooler and unique
than you can in like a regular eyeshadow
so I just don't wanna limit myself I
don't wanna love myself and since the
powder product it's not going to go back
for quite a while no no i meant glitters
I have 16 and I didn't put a limit here
I don't think I need more than like 30 i
would say but again if i see a really
unique litter or I you know I order five
glitters I'm not going to feel bad about
it it's something like glitter how can
glitter go bad and I think they're just
fun and and glitter or something I guess
this is something to UM to point out
like I don't buy a blood or thinking oh
I better use all that up to get my
money's worth out of it instead of by
the glitter because I just like it and
I'm going to use it and if i use that
glitter handful of times or you know X
amount of times to me that's getting my
money's worth out of it if I make a
beautiful look over and over or
something that is so even if i only used
half of it or however much I've got my
money's worth to me it's not one of
those products like I have to use it up
to get my money's worth I guess for
liquid eye shadow which I'm kind of like
the lorac 3d liquid lustre or like I
have one of the josie maran liquid eye
shadows account those I don't want more
than five I do want more of the josie
maran ones I just they dry out that in
my experience so I don't mean more than
five definitely mascaras now I have 19
currently and I put a distinction in my
goal so I'm my goal is to only have like
three open at a time and I don't want
more than 20 in my collection and the
reason I it's so high is just because
sometimes I might buy like a backup but
I'm not opening it or I might get a
sample free with something else or it's
not like I went
specifically bought that mascara as long
as it's not opened I feel like I'm not
wasting it that's my goal is just make
sure that I'm being really conscious of
like the mascaras I'm opening so that
I'm not wasting them or they're not
drying out when I'm not using them
primers for the eyes I have 11 and my
goal is to only have five or at least
five open again primers the thing that
comes in a lot of stuff so as long as
I'm not like opening those so that they
don't go bad or something like that I'm
fine with that but I mean it'd be
awesome to just have five like you don't
need more than five especially cuz they
use cream eyeshadows as bases a lot I
think that's a good goal eyeliners I
have a sick obsession and problem with I
don't even know when this started or how
but I have and I'm talking about just
pencils I have 43 pencils I'm really
working on getting that down this year
you can tell in my project pans my goal
is to only have 15 and I think 15 pencil
liners gives you the option to have
different colors different brands one
black one brown one nude one electric
purple or whatever you need without
having duplicates and without them going
to waste my goal is 15 I don't think I'm
going to get to that obviously this year
unless I just throw away a ton but don't
something I want to work toward
indefinitely I don't want to buy any
eyeliners pencil eyeliners for liquid I
have nine liquid eyeliners and I would
like to go down to six I think six gives
me the option to have just a couple
black ones if I'm trying out different
brands like a brown and then you know if
I have a couple color I don't know I
just definitely don't need more than six
gel eyeliners I just want one but i have
three right now I need to either work
through them or just get rid of them
which is probably what I'll do just get
rid of I don't use gel liner I think it
looks really nice I just haven't
mastered it myself and I just like the
liquid pen if I'm gonna do like a wing
or something she's not a necessity I'd
like to have it in case i want to but
just 111 only now I have another section
for eyeliner and this is glitter
eyeliner I have six currently and I
don't have a limit for the this item
glitter eyeliner to me is something that
I have because it's fun and because it
is beautiful so I don't want to like
have a million but not again trying to
use the whole glitter liner
like I'm not expecting that when I buy
it I want to be obviously in the buying
process making sure I'm gonna love it
but I'm not going to be upset if it
dries out or something if I used it a
handful of times or a good amount of
times lashes I have two pairs lashes I
don't have a limit on that I don't love
lashes are not worried that I'm gonna go
crazy glitter adhesives or seals like to
make liners I have three right now I'd
like to only have really one I just I
have the glitter glue like I just need
the glitter glue and maybe mac fix+ I
don't really need anything else last but
not least i have colored mascaras as a
thing i have to right now and I wouldn't
like more than six ever in my collection
I think that'd be crazy again with this
and I don't see myself running into that
problem and it's also not something that
I'm expecting to use up I'm just using
it for the look to enhance a look a
couple of times but it's never like i'm
gonna wear pink mascara so i use it up
in three months or something like those
are Michael's so I know these might be
different than a lot of other people
schools but I don't care these are mine
so in total i have 301 products which is
crazy but kind of like cool I don't know
that's so sick I really enjoy doing this
project because it really does let me
see what what products am passionate
about and love like the ones they don't
set a goal on and then what products
like what can I live without what can I
pare down and what can I got waste my
money on from now on like don't buy a
liner don't spend twenty dollars on a
liner at sephora like ever Lauren don't
do it I think you don't love liners and
only do that if you really need a black
one and you don't have a black one I
will have two more sections for my
inventory so I'm going to do face
products and then I'm also going to do
like nail polish and perfume in one
video be looking for those and I hope
