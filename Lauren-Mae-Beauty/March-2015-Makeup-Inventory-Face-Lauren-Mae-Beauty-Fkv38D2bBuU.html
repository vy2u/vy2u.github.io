this video series and we are going to be
inventory with my face products this is
very eye-opening to see what I have and
really where I feel like I can cut down
so I'm just gonna get into it again I'm
not showing you the products and I'm
gonna give you guys what I have and then
my goals for where I want to be at some
point in my collection at least at this
point of my life for number one
foundations I have 11 foundations and
these aren't counting like to do boys
risers BB creams ups our own category I
think that's crazy so for me I only want
five I think that's a good amount I
could use five up I feel like in a year
and they're not going to go bad so I
don't want more than five foundations at
a time in my collection I don't care if
they're open or anything I just don't
need more than five and if I don't like
something I can just get rid of it and
get another one instead of trying to
work through it so I just feel like five
definitely is more than enough for me
beauty cream sent in to moisturize just
half three and I think three is great so
I feel go Lauren I feel like that's
definitely more than enough it gives you
one tinted moisturizer one BB cream and
then I don't know one Matt baby Kramer
you know something else to try powders
now I count sample sizes and regular
sizes all the same so maybe that's why
some of these numbers i guess i didn't
mention that my other videos powders
have 17 powders now a lot of these are
gifts with purchases or loose powders or
the Cayman sets or things like that but
I have 17 nonetheless and I would like
only five I am oily so having powders is
good for me but I got just psycho like
17 is crazy i don't care how it doesn't
go bad I just don't that's not where I
want to be spending money my collection
or where I want like my collection to
take up space I don't want five
concealers I have seven now this is
including to like unopened backups and I
would only just like five and I'm kind
of okay with having backups as long as
they're open but definitely no more than
five open at a time because it's there's
just no reason like just finish stuff up
stop having a DD and then if you really
hate something how much that you can't
finish it then why do you eat why are
you using it you know life's too short
to be hating a concealer for six months
that's how I look at it anyway for
primers I have 16 primers and that
including minis and everything that's I
I mean I love primers that's like
something i really do like but i really
don't need more than seven I thought
primer is not working for me and i
bought it i should try to return it or
try to get rid of it so I feel like
seven is a good amount to to keeping
that and to keep me out you know I can
still be experimenting but I just don't
need more than seven blushes I have 46
blushes and I don't know I don't feel
guilty about that number I love all my
blushes I don't have a goal obviously
for that when I'm sure you saw that one
coming I just want to make sure i'm
going through my collection pairing it
through it and making sure that if I
don't like a blush or I haven't used to
blush do I really need it and and kind
of keeping my collection under control
that way I just love blushes I love
trying new blushes cream blushes I have
20 and I'd like to get down to only five
I used to be really into cream blush and
now I'm not there's just a reason to
have that many and I feel like they go
bad and I just don't reach for them a
lot of the ones that i have that our
like cream are those tarts tix i bought
the entire set like the big set of them
I regret that so much I'm I never really
reach for them and I just don't I don't
use cream blush so I'm gonna try to work
through as many of them as I can but I
definitely am NOT looking to repurchase
anything or buy any more cream blushes
in the near future or in late future I'm
just going to work through what I have
and just only have five I want only fine
I have 15 bronzers and that's kind of
crazy too i would like to only have 10
at the max i'd like to have less than
that but definitely no more than 10 i
really only use matte bronzers kind of
want to stay away from shimmery ones as
best I can because I don't use them i
don't use them to warm my skin up so
this summer in Ellen I'm in California I
might get a tan who knows what will
happen so maybe I can start using some
of those shimmering ones I don't know I
kind of want to work on some of those
finding ways to use those in and then if
I can't or I don't like them enough i
want it i want to kind of clean it out
of my collection and only have 10
bronzers i have three cream bronzers and
i'd like to only have one there's no
reason to have
more than one I don't use cream bronzers
I don't use cream products that the
often for my face I'd like to get that
down to one and I really want to do have
the Chanel one but i need to actually
use at least one out before I get you
know buy that expensive of a product for
highlighters I have 12 highlighters
these are powders I'm okay with that I'm
okay with having up to 20 like powder
ones as long as I'm going through again
and cleaning out like old ones ones they
don't like Highlander when I by
highlighter I'm not expecting to use up
that highlighter a hundred percent
honestly I could use half of it or if I
used it for three years or something to
me that's getting my money's worth as
long as I have 20 and I like all those
20 I don't want to go too much over that
but I put put 20th element cream
highlighters I have seven and I only
like about three I don't even need three
but I feel like out of cream products
for like blushes highlighters and
bronzers cream highlights make the most
sense that's the whole reason you're
using a highlight is to look like Dewey
or glowy and I think creams can
definitely or liquids can do that for
you really well I can see having a
higher number of those because I think
they work better but I only want three I
just don't go through them you get those
huge illuminator tubes or whatever how
does anyone go through them I could
never go through that much products to
more categories face palette which these
are three or more products in them I
have 15 face palettes I'm okay with that
number at the moment I don't want to go
too crazy and get a ton more but I
really do like the palette for more like
blush palette or most of what I have it
or blush palette so I really like them
and again I'm not going to feel bad
about having them if I really like them
last but not least our face duos so
these are like bronzer highlighter duos
or blush and bronzer duo's and I have
three of those and honestly I don't like
to buy my stefan tues just because I
feel like rarely do I actually use both
products the only one I can think of
ASEA cosmetics one I do like both those
products the bronzer and highlighter but
everything else I don't see myself
buying or really
investing into any duo so for my face
those are my goals I have 175 products
in total it's just so much so many
products so I don't know like I was
saying I'm not a hundred percent like
with the inventory thing and a sense of
having bowls for everything but then I
read that final total and I just feel
like oh that's so many I'm just kind of
seeing what works for me and doing the
best I can at least at this point and
then potentially by doing this and
project panning maybe even though I'll
have a clear a sense of where i want to
be i think the bullseye sent are good
and then the ones that don't have goals
just making sure that those products are
tightly looked at consistently and
making sure that I'm only keeping stuff
I love I think that will that's good for
me at this point in my life I have one
more video that I'm going to be filming
like this bye guys have a wonderful day
and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
