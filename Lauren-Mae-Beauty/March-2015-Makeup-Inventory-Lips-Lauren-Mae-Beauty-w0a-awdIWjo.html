is going to be my makeup inventory so i
apologize for a couple things first off
if you hear any noises stupid
contractors are working on the building
above me and they have been something
I've den so you can feel my pain when
you hear noises or rumbling or footsteps
or like they're tackling each other up
there so sorry about that i can't help
it and also you can see the glare of my
glasses I just don't care I don't I
don't be squinting McGee today maybe
next time I just want to wear glasses
today so we're just gonna deal with it
and I think that's all the disclaimer i
have but um yeah this is gonna be my
makeup inventory I'm gonna break this in
two different parts just because I don't
want it to be like an 80 minute long
video so i am going to be doing my lips
first and i'm gonna be giving you guys
my current counts of my items and then
also my goals of where i want to be I'm
not a hundred percent on board with like
the whole makeup inventory and like
limiting your stuff yet like I don't
know if I'm just like so sick I can't
limit myself or I just don't know why
I'm just not one hundred percent
convinced on like I have to have only
this many products like this is
something I love so I just want to have
realistic goals for myself so obviously
this is like a personal thing so
everyone's different you know everyone
has their own taste in and what they
want to do anything that's great so this
is just like my take on room a
commitment or let's just get straight in
the lips I'm not going to like show you
products i'm going to do like some
collection videos later like on specific
things instead of like showing them in
this video I'm going to start off again
like I said with lips so don't judge
don't judge I broke these down into
quite a few categories so first category
is colored lipstick so that means
anything that's not like a normal
colored lipstick I have 13 of those i
did recently just by like I think it
came in a 12-pack I only had one before
and then had that 12 pack so a goal that
I have for that is 20 I don't buy a ton
but I would like to maybe you know get a
gray one or you know
different brands come out or whatever I
just kind of love it myself at 20 I'm
okay with it's like potentially getting
rid of summer i don't know i don't so
passionate about those so that i don't
know that's my goal lipsticks i have 55
I don't have a problem with that I'm not
super big with lipsticks I did by other
right in front of me but I did just by
quite a few more so I know that
potentially this could be an issue
because I have gotten into lips a lot
more recently but right now I'm okay 55
and will k with growing a little bit I
want different lipsticks and different
formulas of different brands and all
that so um yeah I 55 right now lip
crayons now these are anything that are
like not like the Jumbo ones are like
more small so I have 18 right now and
I'm sure it have will have more already
by the end of this video I don't have a
lemon on those either those are the form
of lip product I'm super into right now
I don't want to like limit myself
because I'm like kind of going crazy and
I'm enjoying going crazy so 18 no limit
at the at the moment or no gold jumbo
lip crayons I have 12 of those now those
are like the Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain or the tart like lipsurgence
once I have 12 I want to get down to 10
those used to be like the big thing and
those are like my favorite thing ever
and they're just not as much anymore so
I'd like to work through a couple I have
some in my project pan and I don't want
to really buy anymore I guess either I
don't know I'm kind of over them I don't
want more than 10 but I can see myself
trying to work through more of them as
the years go as long lip liners I have
one when i did this count I don't want
more than 15 lip liners I just don't
think it's something that I necessarily
always use I've gone this far without
having any except for one and think 15
is enough to have one that will match
the lipsticks you'll need them for lip
paints I have four and I count those
like two faced liquid lipstick type
things as paints because they're in that
kind of like to I don't have a limit on
this either I I'm not super worried
about myself buying a bunch of those
because they are more difficult to apply
am talking about the occ ones and i
bought a couple Jake at once but I don't
really want any more I wonder if I'm so
squinting um I don't really want any
more of those
necessarily I'm not putting a limit but
if I get a couple I'm not gonna feel
like guilty or something lip glosses I
have 21 and I don't want more than 27 I
don't like lip gloss very much i love
the buxom ones like if i had to pick a
gloss or like the NYX butter glosses but
other than that I just I don't want I
don't want a lot so I have 21 right now
and so if I can work through some i can
buy like a couple if like something's
different but i feel good about where
I'm at I would be fine with staying at
21 lip balms I have 12 I think that's
kind of crazy so i wanna i just don't
want more than five in my life that's
like my ultimate goal I want to have
just like even if they're more expensive
at least you know they're nicer but i
only have five so it's not a big deal
just having that many lip balms is just
kind of crazy and you know just be more
responsible or keep them in the right
places or you know stop wasting your
money on the lip balms tinted lip balms
i have 28 right now when i'd only like
10 i know i have a lot because i bought
like a pack and stuff so i just really
need to work through those before i buy
any new ones i really want to try like
the benefit Benetton's um but i can't i
can't yet until i work through stuff i'd
have liked to have to get rid of 18 like
crazy crazy to get to Michael lip stains
i have three and i'd like to only really
have I put one to two but I don't really
care about lip stains like i said i'm at
the video i just feel like they look the
same on your lips like very rarely are
they gonna look that different it's like
a berry and a light pink but a lot of
lipstick stain I don't know I just don't
I don't see a need for them in my
collection personally I'd be fine with
none but I put one to two I don't want
more than that for sure lip treatments
and scrubs I have three and I'm okay
with having two to three to feel good in
there I just don't think you need a ton
and I don't have a ton so go me and then
lip palette I have one lip palette it's
that Bobby Brown when I'm trying to work
through this year and then after that I
okay with just having one or none really
I just you know who uses a lip palette
just not a practical thing you carry
around with you or will use up so I
don't it's not a necessity definitely in
my collection liquid lipstick I have
three liquid lipsticks at the moment and
I don't have a limit on that either
that's kind of like a huge trend this
year so far is liquid lipstick so I
don't want to like say can only have
five and you know I want to buy some of
the Anasazi ones or or you know
different ones so that's that's kind of
my goals in total I have a hundred and
seventy four products you think that's
really psycho and that's just for lips
obviously so I don't know I just um the
biggest thing with these collections
like anything that I have a limit for I
just really want to love everything that
I do have so you know constantly be
going through my collection and just
making sure that like okay yeah I have a
hundred lipstick let's say but I love
every single one of them or I really do
truly want to use them and if I don't
then finding another home or trying to
use it up and just being proud of my
collection and not just collecting to
collect but instead collecting I don't
you want to call collecting but having
them because you really do truly you
know enjoy the formula or the color or
whatever I think I just want to have a
collection that represents myself and
like things I really enjoy instead of
just having a collection to have a
collection like making that distinction
this year and obviously these goals to
they aren't something I'm going to
necessarily hit this year but they're
just something I do want to work toward
it just kind of keep in mind as I'm at
the store or while I'm going through my
collection and purging and so I just
don't go kind of two crazy at least in
the categories that I don't want to go
too crazy on so that's anything for lips
I don't know it's kind of a lot yeah
that's a lot but I think this is just a
great way to stay focused on your goals
and kind of know where you're at you
know you don't know how many lipsticks
you have until you count them and then
you feel like a crazy person that's
everything for this one I will have my
other parts up um after this so yeah
talk to you in my next video see you
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
