video for my inventory so I'm going to
be doing my nail polishes and then also
my perfumes for this specifically it's
gonna work a little bit different than
my makeup I don't have specific goals on
these ones it's more just overall goals
considering the entire collection for
nail polishes I broke it up a brand I
have 51 OPI nail polishes the reason I
have a lot of OPI and i also have quite
a bit of SE and even tryna blaze as my
mom is a hairdresser so i'm going to go
to cosmoprof and a lot of places like
that and i get nail polish at their rate
so basically half off I get all my nail
polishes I guess just a little
disclaimer or a little reason I guess
why it's easier for me to have that many
I didn't spend ten dollars or nine
something on them butter london i have
41 nail polishes SE i have 67 julep i
have 17 china glaze i have 64 sally
hansen i have 17 deborah lippmann i have
five lime crime i have four illamasqua i
have to i have two of the sephora
formula x brand color club I have three
rimmel out of the 60 second ones i have
two and then brands that only i only
have one of I didn't list those
individually and I have 11 of those
single ones so in total i have 286
polishes that's a lot of nail polish and
I didn't send myself goals in the sense
of life I only want this mini OPI or I
want this much se instead I just said
some like overall goals for my
collection so one I want to make sure
i'm painting my nails more often this
year so i would like to be painting them
two to three times a week actually
filming videos has been helping me
because i have been I want my nails to
look good for video and I don't want to
look like i've been wearing same nail
polish or chipped nail polish for like
eight weeks straight that's been helping
me but i really want to make sure that
i'm working through my nail polishes
actually using my collection that
they're not just sitting there bottles i
also want to be using either more colors
or the colors I love or trying out
different onto my collections everyone's
I've never used before and if I don't
like them then I'm getting rid of them
like painted on my nails and I didn't
like it then why do I have it let's pass
it on or maybe looking at duplicates do
I have shades in there that are super
similar to each other and I can i get
rid of one of those and keep one in a
formula i like better and get rid of
another one i kind of want to take the
time to do that this year or two so am i
do a video on that at some point not
necessarily in the future or the near
future and then another point i don't
want to buy over 20 nail polishes this
year i haven't been on a nail polish
kick in a long time so I feel like
that's definitely doable I'd like to
ultimately by lesson 20 but I did give
myself 20 because i really like limited
edition collection type stuff like OPI
or se or try to glaze when they come out
with their limited edition stuff I kind
of go crazy especially because I can get
them cheaper with my mom those are just
some cool to have for the year with my
nail polish I would like to do to
clutter video maybe like halfway through
the year and just see what have I used
what haven't I gravitated toward why
haven't I should i get rid of it and
just kind of declutter and see what i
can get rid of but before we moved I did
declutter I mean a lot of nail polish
like I gave my cousin like a huge bag
that held sheets in it a hundred percent
full of nail polishes for her birthday
like I I've done a good job like at one
point i'm sure i had well over like 350
nail polishes so those are my nail
polishes okay so last then i'm gonna be
in ventura in this way are gonna be
perfumes i don't think i have a problem
with perfume so i just wrote these down
just to kind of know about it but these
there's four five different like
categories in the perfume section 1i
have vile samples to these or any of
those just like many little vials I'm 92
of those I know that sounds like a lot
but I don't ever pay for these so
whenever so for you can pick out your
samples or an ulta I usually always pick
perfume samples because I feel like I'm
getting my money's worth they're like
the most expensive when I get them I
don't expect to use them I kind of am
just collecting those like I think
they'd be really cool to just have a ton
of them especially I want their vintage
like is that crazy i don't know so I'm
not worried about the number because i'm
not trying to work through those but i'm
okay with having a lot because i like
just like i like just having them and
collecting them like just straight up
collecting them nothing to use them with
and since i'm not paying for him i don't
feel like it's a waste of money same
with like the deluxe ice samples so
these are the ones that maybe look like
a miniature of the bottle they're
usually like point 13 ounces i have 17
of those and i do collect those as well
so i don't expect to use those up I just
love collecting the mini bottles I think
they're so adorable I love mini stuff if
anything I hope it grows you know um I
hope I get more by the end of the year
roller balls I have 16 roller balls now
this is counting full sizes half sizes
you know everything in between there are
anything with the rollerball on it and
this is something I want to cut back on
I only want five I don't use roller
balls they don't reach for them so that
perfume even if it is something i like
I'm not I'm not getting my use out of it
so I'd like to use those up I do have
one roller ball in one of my project
pans and I kind of think I'm gonna put
one in every single like big one I do
like every freestyle I guess project pan
that I have I'm going to put one in
there and I'm just trying trying to work
through them and try to get down to five
sometimes soon and when I say soon and a
couple of years and then bottles of
perfume I have 11 different bottles of
perfume and I'm fine with that number I
feel like I have perfumes my collection
everything is something I like and I
wouldn't want to get rid of I want to
work through them on a regular basis but
nothing like I hate this perfume I'm
going to spray it all the time to get
rid of it I just you know I just want to
make sure that whatever perfumes I do
get I love I don't have a goal on that
but I also I'm not really big on mine
perfume like maybe three a year if that
I didn't include body splashes as well I
have 16 in here I put my goal is 12 or
14 but I was watching an old video and I
really don't need even that many so I
think I'm gonna even bring it down to 10
and I just don't use body splashes I
think they're great for summer but they
just don't stay on I don't want my money
to be going there so if i get like the
free ones from Bath and Body Works
that's okay or something
but I just don't need full sizes and I
definitely don't need that many do you
have overall goals for my perfume
collection so one of those goals is to
make sure that i'm only buying travel
sizes of body splashes unless obviously
it's more cost effective to get the
bigger one but even then i really should
be in the market for them I don't want
to be purchasing that many but if i do
say I really loved something I want the
travel size because it just takes so
long to go through them and I feel like
I get tired of sense before I use up a
full one I think it'll be really rare
for me to want to buy another one in
full size after using a full size that's
just the way I'm going to cut down on
having so many at least in ounces even
if it's a bunch of the front sense it's
less ounces in my collection I want to
make sure to that I'm only buying the
small bottles of perfume so if i buy it
perfume just get the small one and then
if you really like it you can always
repurchase the big one I just think
that's a good rule it's kind of like
with makeup once you have so many if you
just went through all of them and like
one spray sprayed one each day it would
take you so long to use it up I don't
need a big one and if I did make through
a small one then I feel like there's
reason to buy the big one but try the
small one make sure you like it maybe
you'll get tired of the scent and if you
do you didn't waste you know an extra
thirty dollars on the big size and then
the last one is I'm not letting myself
get n roller balls I will not use them
there's just no reason if I want to
sample it I'd rather have a little vial
or just smell it like smell at 80
million times we're on your skin sprayed
every time you go to Sephora and if you
like it then after great consideration
purchase it in the small bottle roller
balls I just don't like that I can't
spray them so i guess a spray rollerball
some of the companies have been coming
out those might be okay but just
definitely not actual like roll on i
just i don't like how they apply I don't
feel like they make you smell like
perfume very well and they're just not
something I want in my collection I know
I won't use them those are all my goals
