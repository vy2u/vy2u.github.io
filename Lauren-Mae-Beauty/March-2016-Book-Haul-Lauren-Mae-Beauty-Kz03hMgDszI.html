it's Lauren this is going to be a video
I've been done on my channel ever this
is a book haul I have been really into
watching people on booktube and I've
just been inspired myself to read more
that's one of my goals for this year I
originally wanted to only read six books
this year and now I'm going 4-12 haha I
am just in total of people who can read
so many books in just one month and so I
always had the thirst store with my mom
when she was in town and they were
having an amazing deal on books I got
all these books for fifty cents each I
couldn't pass up the deal and I thought
this is a great way for me to get some
fresh books in my collection that I'm
excited to read and not have the risk of
paying it to the money you can't beat
the price I seriously spent less than
five dollars for all of these books some
of these I'm really excited about some
of these I really didn't know much but
the like book intrigued me just from the
outside cover I'm just going to show you
guys what I got if you have read any of
these before and you have any opinions
let me know down below and if I put your
anyone's name from the authors please
forgive me my ignorance is not
intentional we'll start off with this
one this is Barbara Ehrenreich
Fahrenheit I don't know starting off for
the hardest one this is this land is
their land from Barbara Ehrenreich I
believe that's how you would say that
this one I just picked up because of the
way it looked I kind of originally
thought that this is going to be like
about Native Americans and like America
but I just read a tiny synopsis on it
before I started filming and it's
actually more about the rich getting
richer the poor getting poorer and that
type of stuff so like medical bills I
feel like big corporations against you
know the smaller middle class lower
class as well as undocumented immigrants
and things like that so I think this is
like a work of essays like a bunch of
different essays and stories so I'm
excited to read this and kind of delve
into it sometimes it's kind of
interesting and fun to not know what
you're reading plus I am new to reading
books like at least on hopefully a
larger scale than I ever have in my life
and so I
don't really know what I like I don't
know what kind of books I like if I like
fantasy non fiction fiction just
anything like that so um I'm kind of
trying to just branch out see you know
put my fingers out there and then I can
kind of from there edit down what I
actually like and kind of be able to
pick better books for myself anyway I'm
starting off with the other book that I
didn't really know much about but just
kind of wanted to pick up because it
seemed interesting this is jay Reiner's
the man who ate the world in search of
the perfect dinner he is a really
renowned food taste tester and really
fine dining establishments and this is
kind of a mix of memoir as well as rants
and raves and his view of seeing the
world through food his opinions on it
and I'm kind of interested in it it
seems kind of interesting another kind
of very specific outlook on the world
because his job is they're very
different I don't know I'm excited to
see it i really don't know much about
this so we shall see how this goes the
next book I picked up is waiter rant and
this is by Steve de Blanc de Blancs ya
de blanca de blanca dude I don't know oh
my gosh I feel so so stupid but this is
a book I actually picked up for my mom
and she read it and then when I was in
town I was like I'm gonna get it too
because she really did enjoyed it it's
all about just like this waiters
experience waiting on tables and being
in the restaurant industry and I I think
those are fun I think that is something
I'm really into are like personal
stories memoirs autobiographies
biographies that type of stuff I think
that I will really enjoy this plus my
mom really liked it so I'm excited to
you know have something to talk to with
her about that we both have in common
and have read this is something I was
really excited to find this is david
sedaris is when you are engulfed in
flames I really like David Sedaris me
and Sam have listened to let's explore
diabetes with owls when we were on a
road trip and then we also had audiobook
of the holiday on ice
think is what it was yeah holidays on
ice and they make me crack up and I
think he's just really talented and
funny and so I'm excited to read this
book as well from him and yeah I just I
already know I like him so I'm excited
to read this one this is a book called
stoop by Sam Gosling it says PhD and
this is a book that says this is why I
wanted this it says what your stuff says
about you and being in the project panic
community where I am very focused on
just kind of minimizing decluttering and
I'm very interested in like why I want
this stuff and I'm excited to kind of
read this and maybe it'll have some
answers or just like you know keep me
thinking and keep me on track for
minimizing or just like realizing why I
want things or what the things i have
say about me and if I want to change
that or whatnot so I thought this was
really exciting I think this will be the
next one I read after I finish the book
i'm reading now but once i am reading
this i'll let you guys know if you want
to about this and if it's good or what
not so i am really excited for this one
this is little children by tom perrotta
this one I picked up because I really
like the movie I know a lot of people
like to read the books before they see
the movie I'm not a big reader at least
not before now hopefully he'll read more
read this is why I'm making this video
to cuz when you guys are like hey you've
never read any of those books i can do
like you're right but anyway I thought
that since I love the movie so much it
has kate winslet in it um it's just
really good it's like dark it's totally
my type of movie it's like dark and sexy
and all that so anyway I thought I would
enjoy reading the book too and it to be
different I haven't watched the movie in
a while so I thought that it would still
be fresh and a lot of the times the book
does differ from the movie at least in a
few ways so I thought this would be an
interesting one something a little
different from the other books I've
picked out so far I didn't know it was a
book before movie so I'm excited to read
this one I'm excited to read them all
duh but I am excited for this one this
is a book called factory girls from
village to city and a changing China
this is by Leslie teach aang and I got
this because I thought that it would be
a very interesting story something a
little more heavy from just reading that
title i think it'll it'll be something
that just kind of wakes you up two
things going on outside of your world
and i'm interested to just hear someone
else's story that i don't really know
much about so yeah again i'm excited for
this book my mom really wants to read
this one after i finish it so i need to
get on this one two more books left the
next book that I picked up this is from
Agustin burrows a wolf at the table this
is a memoir of my father I picked this
up because I'm currently reading an
Agustin burrows a book I'm reading
possible side effects and I also really
love the movie running with scissors
which is based off one of his books as
well so I thought why not get another
one of his books I do really like his
writing he's also super hilarious I have
found myself laughing so much like
laughing out loud literally LOL Aang
from his book possible side effects I
definitely recommended it's just funny
he's just so funny I feel like we would
be really good friends anyway I am
excited to read this I do think this is
gonna be a little bit more serious but
I'm sure he will be still his witty self
throughout it and be like snarky and
stuff so I am excited to read this book
as well last I picked up the help this
is something I picked up because the
movie has been raved about this book has
been raved about and I just thought this
is going to be kind of one of those not
feel good because it is dealing with
issues but I just one of something
different I feel like then the other
books I picked out something that's just
more contemporary and like a lot of
people on a large scale have read and
enjoyed and I thought why not be one of
those people who have read it so again
for fifty cents i thought this might be
a good one to to read or to have when
I'm when I'm feeling a book like this
those are all the books I picked up I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I know
it's something different i know this is
mostly like beauty but i hope you guys
