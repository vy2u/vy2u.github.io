my last video I promise this is going to
be my March empties I have quite a few
empties here although not a ton of I
feel like normal products I don't know a
lot of hair stuff so let's just get into
it I'm gonna start off with the makeup
items first just cuz they're the most
fun I have about five makeup related
items here so the first one here is an
eyeliner this is from Makeup Forever
there aqua eyes eyeliner it's just in a
brown color it was only a deluxe eyes
mini so it wasn't like full-size I did
enjoy this I thought it stayed in the
waterline pretty well and I don't know
if I'd repurchase but I did like the
brown color I think it really like set
off my blue-eyes nicely so glad to
finish up another liner when I went
through my eyeliners to declutter I was
really surprised at how many black and
brown ones I have it's not much it's
definitely under five each which I know
is still crazy but not as insane as it
was so happy to be done with another
eyeliner another one I'm really proud of
this is my bare minerals powder
foundation in the shade fairly light and
it's completely done i took the stopper
out someone asked me in one of the
videos and i didn't comment back so i'm
sorry but you can just pop out the
stopper with like a tweezer that's what
I did it was super easy and simple just
a way to get basically like one more use
out of this or if you don't want to like
just shake shake shake so much you can
just do that first I'm gonna stop
filming while he cuts everything great
okay hopefully we're better now that
they're gone so let's just keep going
another makeup item I used up was this
mascara I was declutter and I was just
looking through the mascaras I had and
this one I knew I'd have been open but
like there is no product in here I don't
know why I put it back in the drawer
it's totally done so definitely all used
up I'm not just getting rid of it cuz
it's old it's like there's nothing in
here I don't know I'm not usually like
that so it's weird that I did that
makeup related i have a beauty blender
here sorry it's super dirty but i'm not
going to clean it to throw it away this
is just the pink one and i did switch to
the black one and for whatever reason I
just like the pink one better i don't i
don't know what it is I feel like it's
like skinny or something I don't know to
me it feels different but I could just
be crazy it was just time to change it I
have quite a few beauty blenders in
backup so it's not like there's a reason
like I don't have to go purchase one or
something
there there I might as well use them and
actually change this out in a reasonable
amount of time I have a pair of lashes
in here as well and although the lashes
aren't in there these ones are really
intense I don't think I actually even I
think I might have tried to wear them
and I didn't like them or cut them up or
I don't know it didn't really work out
but i did use these kind of or try to i
used up a hand soap from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this scent is okay it's nothing
that special to me which is weird
because peach scents are like my
favorite I don't know it's just okay but
what I do love is like there is no
product left because it's a foaming one
that's something I love about the
foaming ones for Bath &amp;amp; Body Works you
can use every last drop and I just feel
like it's less wasteful although I do
feel like you go through these faster so
it's a give and take this is another
hand soap we went through this is the
apple mango hand soap this melt really
nice again as much as I love apples and
mangoes it wasn't that great i don't
know it just was not as fresh it just
smells really really sweet and kind of
fake almost so like a apple mango drink
it's like something like syrupy it was
okay I'm not saying I would never
repurchase said but I definitely would
look into different sense you guys know
again I love the bathroom anywhere
chance opes I think I only have like
four left and I haven't bought one in
like over a year that's how big my back
stockpile was and that's crazy Sam's
like you literally had that much hands
up like a year's worth hand soap on hand
I was like yeah so I'm excited to
potentially be able to buy a new hand
soaps this year and actually be like
justified in it and yet another hand
soap this is a huge hand soap let me
pull it back for you guys I'm really
zoomed in right now i don't i don't know
why i wanted to be that close but here I
am it look so dark to it all why that is
huh
hopefully it doesn't look dark to you
guys this is like a rosemary and
lavender essential oil hand soap this
won't really nice i had a lot of
compliments on people and i liked how
big it was it was in my kitchen it took
forever to use up so i did really enjoy
this and i would potentially repurchases
this was from marshalls and it was like
seven ninety-nine I think it was worth
799 for how long it lasted I will say
though that when you're washing your
hands it kind of slipped off the hand
didn't like stick to the hands where you
could wash him really well I mean I
still liked it I wouldn't like not
purchase it because of it but it's just
definitely a different hand soap texture
I have to con round packs here and these
are definitely different these ones are
from walgreens there the studio 35
beauty and these ones are encapsulated
and we're good i like these but they are
more expensive than a dollar which you
guys all know my team with that these
have a hundred in them they're from big
lots they were a dollar twenty these are
not encapsulated so little fibers are
going everywhere I hate these I hate
these um I did just go to bed locks
today and I got an 80 pack for I think a
dollar twenty so it's 20 less for the
same price but they are believe
encapsulated so I'm gonna try those out
but I have quite a few of these to get
through they just like it gets in your
eyes it's touch your eyelashes it's
stuck in your eyebrows irritated I do
not recommend those at all I have a few
makeup wipes these are from a pill fpl
um this is the cucumber ones and these
are the green tea green tea I just got
these I got even more of these from big
lots today I'm about like six packs of
the aloe ones those are my favorite ones
these are really nice for a dollar I
think they're really like really good
for a dollar you can't be 30 wipes for a
doll hair come on it's like six dollars
for six months worth of wipes if used
one today please girl that's too good of
a deal so I definitely will continue to
repurchase these and I like having them
in my kit because people love to use
makeup wipes and some people use like
seven on their face and if i had spent
like seven dollars on one pack i would
be like pissed but girl have the whole
pack take it home with you so I feel
about it I have two josie maran things
and these are not used but I'm getting
rid of them um as you guys saw in my
march mini madness please go bad
so just be careful I do have one mini 1
and then 1 i'm using now that aren't
guide so I'm going to keep those but
these two were bad when was the milk and
one was the original so getting rid of
those I have a body wash in here this is
from sebamed they did send me five
products to try out about the line I was
thinking about doing a review on them
but i think i might just as I use them
up just do reviews in my empties this
took quite a long time to use up I
really liked that it had a pump on it
sebamed is like it reminds me of like
Sarah V or those like more drug store
but like more medical brands um this is
like more affordable I feel like the big
thing about this one is it's like for
sensitive skin it's paraben free it also
is supposed to like regulate your pH and
balance your ph this was okay i thought
it filmed up nicely I just you know it's
not a fun product I'll just if I'm being
real I thought it was weird that the
color of it was so green I feel like for
something that's supposed to be so
natural that's such an unnatural color
I'm not hating I just I just thought
that was interesting it kind of had like
a shimmer running through it and then
this smelt like medical but like the
ocean like an ocean breeze sent but like
clean just kind of basic not I don't
know it works well if you have a like a
lot of issues skin issues and things
break you out or you're sensitive to
like bath and body works stuff then this
might be an option for you I'm not and
so I just prefer about the body work
stuff because it's fun and it's
different sense and just makes my shower
experience more fun so um it wasn't a
bad product it's just a little boring
this little boring but it's medicated so
or like you know it's more of a medical
thing so if that's what you need then
you might have to just go with this now
let's get into some hair products I have
a couple that Sam used up I thought I'd
just show you these are Bosley products
these are the nourishing shampoo for
visibly thinning hair we don't want him
to lose his hair I mean if he does he
does and he'll be bald like John
Malkovich but if he could not lose his
hair I know he would appreciate that so
we just use I'm kind of like hair
thinning hair shampoos now just to kind
of be preventative and so we got these
in a pack
he was using those those are things you
can't like I can't tell you yeah work
she has all his hair because you know
you don't know how much you would have
lost or whatever another thing that Sam
for the most part used up was the unite
texturizer spray this is a dry finishing
spray you can use it to texturize the
hair I really really like this product
it works really well definitely add some
texture if you're someone who has really
limp or fine thin hair who you can't get
body unless it's like old like second
day hair this can give you it on first
day I really really like it Sam uses it
to like kind of do his little like poof
thing he does we we both really like it
it works really well it's expensive this
is like a thirty dollar product but I've
repurchased it because it's like what he
uses and it's worth it you know if you
feel confident about your hair if this
is the only product he uses and he goes
through it in like two months I think
it's worth it so yeah we both really
like this I got this from work as gratis
originally and then I've repurchase
distance to more hair products this is
the conditioner of the pureology
strength cure shampoo set I use the
shampoo up last empties finally use this
up you guys know how I feel about this
it smells gross I don't really like it
I'm not saying it's a bad product I just
didn't notice anything amazing and the
smell alone is enough to make me want to
like throw it out the window and then
this is another shampoo actually this is
the conditioner this came in influenster
voxbox to my house this is the kerastase
resist almonds so I'm premier therapist
this came in with a shampoo and
conditioner but you used them opposite
so you use the conditioner first and
then use the shampoo it's like a reverse
care system I actually really like that
about it because again i have fine thin
hair so sometimes when you use the
conditioner they just way my hair down
at the end but I found that I could use
the conditioner in my entire head you
know rub it into my roots rub it into my
ends and then go with the shampoo and my
hair felt brushable and soft but still
was light so i probably would never
spend this much money for this product
I'd rather buy like the bumble humble
serf shampoo and conditioner but knows
as it should but I did really like them
I am currently still using the shampoo
it's in the shower but I have I did
enjoy this I thought
smelt really really good that was
something that was a super big plus to
me it was really good I don't think I'd
repurchase just because of price last
thing this is a floss I used some flaw
sup we always use philosophy wait that's
everything for my empties thank you so
much for watching guys I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day I can't wait
to come back after being on set and into
