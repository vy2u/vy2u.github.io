channel it's Lauren this is going to be
yet another de-clutter on my channel I
am super happy I don't know what what
got into me today I just felt like
decluttering and when you feel the urge
you just go with it I kind of kept in
mind that I'm going to Vegas for my
brother's 21st birthday in the next and
only a couple days actually not even
five days and I thought this would be a
great opportunity for me to pass on some
makeup to my mom
and to people who could use it so I kept
that in the back of my mind as
motivation to like get rid of stuff and
I'm really happy I really focused on my
single shadows and my like depotted
shadows those who that is where this
whole thing started and then I was just
in the groove and kept going so I also
did a bunch of nail polishes that'll
probably be a separate video just
because it's gonna be a long one anyway
I'm gonna show all these products to you
just like holding them up I think it'll
be easier that way I don't know about
the nail polishes though I might just
throw them in the end I'm not really
sure let's get into what I got rid of so
if you guys have seen any of my to
clutter videos in the past I will link
some down below just as a reference of
what I got rid of so I'm getting rid of
to completely empty Coastal Scents
palettes I did take out the like foam
insert on these so it's just like a
magnet there and I'm getting rid of two
of these and then I'm getting rid of I
believe two more filled with shadows so
I know it's crazy and so I got rid of
all of those from my collection now I
only have Z palette filled with Coastal
Scents makeup geek Mac whatever I have
but I told myself like I don't want any
of these palettes left I only want my Z
palettes because I have three large Z
pellets and three like little square
ones and I'm like that's enough because
you have a million palettes this is the
first palette that I'm going to show you
guys so I'm getting rid of all of those
shadows it's a ton I'm not gonna go
through and name them all most of these
I believe it's not all of them are
Coastal Scents nothing's wrong with the
shadows it's not that they're bad
quality it's just that I have a million
all linked by a thousand I shot a video
down below and you all know but I just
have way too many shadows and I just was
trying to be as real advice
it's possible that although I could put
these in my kid freelance with them and
everything it's just I'd rather use the
stuff that I already know works and I
already use so I'm not gonna keep around
shades just to have or that they're
neutral or whatever so I'm really really
proud of myself and I'm getting rid of
all of these it's a breakthrough today
that's all you gotta say I also got rid
of I had some of these pallets most of
these were empty but I did fill them oh
no this one's empty still some of them I
think I did fill with shadows we'll see
this one's also empty I must have moved
them these are all empty so I'm just
getting rid of the bulk of those out of
my collection and this was the other big
shadow-like palette that I'm getting rid
of I went through all my palettes I went
through all of my shadows and just
decided to get rid of stuff so like all
of these big shadows here are from Stila
these are all like urban decay from like
the ammo palette the Mariposa palette
and stuff like that all of these are
Medusa's makeup I really don't think the
quality is that great and there's so
much glitter in all of these shadows so
I just was like get rid of them Lauren
these are more urban decay that's a Mary
Kay shadow this is a duo from NARS and
belissima or something and then these
are some Too Faced shadows so I wasn't
trying to pay attention to brand I
really was paying attention to like what
grab me what I actually like wanted to
use and then I tried my best to really
narrow down if shadows looked really
similar to just like keep one or two
instead of all five so another really
big big moment for me getting rid of all
these and there was one more of these
down in the bottom of this huge bin and
it did have shadows in it so I'm getting
rid of all those Coastal Scents shadows
as well and I'm so happy guys that's
like a ton of eye shadow this was
something in my collection it was just
like an empty little guy I'm getting rid
of it it just holds shadows I got it
from if see a long time ago I am getting
rid of my Smashbox blue eyes palette I
was gonna keep this just so at the end
of the year I could like show it but I
don't want to do that I don't want to
keep it around for that long so I'm
gonna get rid of it
is a little trio from Becca I got this
off of all cosmetics wholesale really
pretty colors never used this was
something that was really hard this is a
Bare Minerals quad and it's in the color
or the type the soundtrack really pretty
colors I kept it mostly for that rose
gold I got it for free from work and I
have so many colors like that it's not
worth keeping the whole quad over I
would just rather someone else enjoy it
I got rid of a wet and wild trio this is
in the silent treatment super pretty
colors great pigmentation I just have
other things like it everything else is
gonna be kind of random so we're just
gonna go for it this is the Too Faced
lash and better than false lashes like
system I got this in a Sephora favorites
kit a long time ago never used it I'm
gonna pass it on this is a Rimmel blush
in the color tickle me pink I just
decided that I have other colors like it
I'm just gonna get rid of it another
blush I'm getting rid of this is
embellished from Tarte it's one of their
ones that's in the small kits for the
holidays and it's a pretty color but it
has gold glitter throughout it and it's
just not worth it keeping it from me and
one other blush or countless color
pigment this is from Stila this is in
the color lyric and I just decided I'm
just gonna get rid of it I don't want to
try to use it as an eyeshadow so I'm
just gonna get rid of it some more face
products this is the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil this is a medium deep and it's
just like a tester or sample size I went
through one of these already last year
it took me forever and I have so many
bronzers I really don't feel like going
through another one of these I don't
like hate it I have like a love-hate
relationship with it and it's just not
something that I'm really wanting to use
so if I ever want this again I'll just
either get a sample of it or buy it but
that will be like in years so I'm
getting rid of it this is something I
you feel like I recently got but I'm
just getting rid of it this is the
Sephora highlighter and light beam this
has so much glitter in it it is really
pretty but it's just so glittery it's
not shimmery it's glittery and I love
glitter but I don't feel like I'll use
this I just have other highlighters I've
used over this if I want glitter like
I'll pour glitter on myself
this is
a cheek stain from Tarte this is in the
color fantasy it's a really pretty
highlighting color it's a little deep
for my skin tone and I could make it
work but I just don't want to I barely
want to use this as it is I don't have
to work to use it I have a couple
foundation type products this is
something I just hauled from generation
Beauty this is the Juice Beauty stem
cellular repair CC cream it has no
coverage I don't want to go through this
so I'd rather pass it on this is
something I got a long time ago this is
the Maybelline Dream wonder fluid touch
foundation this just makes me really
oily really fast I just don't want to
use it up I have a lot of other
foundations I'd rather to use over this
and so I'm just gonna get rid of it and
then this is a little sample I got this
is a to shake lot leave latent latent I
don't know it's a foundation it's in a
color obviously way too dark for me I
was gonna just use it as a mixer but
it's like this would take forever it's
just not worth it I don't know what I
was thinking so I'm passing it on I
think I got it as a free sample on
Sephora proof that you don't always need
the free samples guys get rid of them
this is a highlighting product it's
liquid highlighter it's really pretty a
peachy glowy color I was gonna keep it
to use it at my kid but I've just
decided to just pass it on get rid of it
I just I don't need it well this
eyeshadow must've cracked um this is
nude swing I think from Too Faced it's
in the old packaging super old I'm gonna
actually throw it away now that it's
cracked but I I just don't need it once
again all of these I just don't need I'd
rather use so many other things in my
collection and I just really felt that
way today so I went for it and got rid
of stuff I have two of the Too Faced
primer not primary potions shadow
insurance
that's what theirs is called I'm getting
rid of both of these I have a small one
I have other ones that I have I just
don't need this much and someone else
should put this to good use before they
go bad I am getting rid of a ton of
color pop shadows I just don't really
like them they're not that they're bad
quality you put my basket down it's not
that they're bad quality I just don't
reach for them and so they're just not
worth even five dollars for me
personally because I don't use them I'd
rather if I'm gonna go super metallic or
super sparkly use a pigment because I
like a more blown out look and I like to
do different things and I just sometimes
it's hard to blend these for me
personally or I just don't want to work
with this type of texture I'd rather
work with powder so I'm getting rid of
the color hammered sequin cricket summer
lovin chipper and the last one here is
crinkle I'm getting rid of all of them I
think I only have three left in my
collection now and who knows what I'll
get rid of those but I only kept the
couple that I felt like I could use his
bases or are more unique these ones I
just I'm not going to use and I haven't
used I'm getting rid of a couple
pigments I do really like pigments but
these ones were just ones that I wasn't
just loving when I looked at them I just
could definitely could do without them
so I'm going to this one um most of them
are from bare minerals one is from
Jessie's Girl this is in the color dove
it's like a matte like gray purple color
this one's Jessie's girls in Penny
Arcade really really pretty I have a
similar shade though in a Ben Nye color
and it's not as glittery it's more just
metallic and I liked it better this one
is a mint color in the color mint from
bareMinerals and last this is the color
princess and it's like a really light
purple color which is something I
usually really love but I am just I have
other ones and I like better and this
one kind of turns more white and not as
purple once you actually blend it out so
I'm just gonna get rid of it
I have a few more I'd products this is a
cream shadow from Tarte in the color
slate I just don't need this product and
it's a little dark for me I just don't
use these as bases very often so I'm
just gonna get rid of them I used to
love cream shadows as bases and now I
just don't love it as much so I don't
need it I have a couple cream shadow
sticks this one is from normal this is
the scandalize and it's like a taupe
color in the color tresspassing toe
really pretty never used it and so I'm
just gonna get rid of it I do think it'd
look really pretty like smudge under the
lash line but I have so many other like
other things I could use to do that and
I just haven't used it yet so it's not a
reason to keep it I have two of the NYX
jumbo eye pencils and one is in the
color iced mocha and the other one
in the color cottage cheese both of
these are shimmery both of these I don't
think I've ever used I've never even had
to sharpen them and I've had them since
before I moved out to California like
years before that so I mean it needs to
go and then one more single shadow I
think this one is from Michael Todd and
it's in the color pleasure it's a really
pretty taupey color and that's why I've
kept it but I have other taupe like I
have a million chumps and I don't wear
taupe I only wear really warm colors
usually so there's no reason to have
this I have a few mascaras that I'm
gonna get rid of and these are just
because I just don't need them and I
have a lot of unused unopened mascaras
waiting to go and these are ones I just
don't want to use so this one is
benefits they're real I've used this
before so I've already kind of tried it
I know it works well but it's so hard to
get off that I don't really want to deal
with it I'm gonna get rid of it this is
makeup forever and it's like they're
smoky extravagant lash it's that crazy
brush with like it looks like Christmas
tree I don't even want to try it I don't
think I'll like it I don't even a I
don't care I don't want it unless this
one's from the balm I believe and it's
what's your type it's just a mascara I
don't want it again it's going going
away this is another one too I'm getting
rid of this is the falsies volum Express
it's the waterproof one I just have had
this a long time and I don't want to get
back into it so I'm getting rid of it I
actually have a few eyeliners in here
too I'm really proud of that because
eyeliners are like an issue for me I
have Rockstar by Urban Decay I have a
bigger pencil of this so I didn't need
to and so I got rid of it the smaller
one the other liner that I have from
Urban Decay is twice baked I also have
hustle and I have a couple of they're
brown ones this one I just didn't like
as much it was a little more cool toned
but still shimmery and I figured I'd
like the warmer ones better so I'm just
getting rid of it and then I have to
smudge shakes from Stila one is in the
color starfish the other one is in the
color tetra ones purple ones like an
olive green I don't wear olive green and
I already have one from Urban Decay so I
could clutter it the other one and then
the other purple one I just had other
Purple's I didn't want it and then
everything I have left in the basket are
all lip products once again lip products
are not my thing
so I was even more harsh on my
self and got rid of even more stuff I
have to lime cream lipsticks here ones
in bay bet in Allen's in cokehead I
don't really like the formula of these
regardless of the whole lime crime
situation so I am getting rid of these I
don't need them and I definitely am not
gonna use them so someone else should
use them not me I got rid of two glosses
these are both by buxom one is in the
color Leslie I think this wasn't a
project at some point but I'm getting
rid of it and then this one's in Dali I
already had another one in the color
golly I do like this color and it's the
color of like the like the lip crayon
that I love but I don't need two of them
if I really go through all of that one
and want it again I will just purchase
it to me that is worth it than keeping
this guy around and in four years still
having it out of some traditional
lipsticks I decided to just get rid of
this one and from Maybelline this is
shocking Coral it's a cream finish it's
not gonna stay on my lips the way I want
it to so I'm just gonna get rid of it
this is a matte color from Revlon in the
color fabulous fig I just don't really
want this color it's not dark it's not
light I don't really want it and then I
also getting rid of this NARS one and I
was kind of surprised because this is
totally my color but I have the one from
butter LONDON yeah from butter LONDON in
Lady Bird and then I also have one from
NARS and a pencil so I really just don't
another one in ours like in an actual
pencil so I don't need this and this is
a cream finish so I know that I'll reach
for the matte ones over this anyway and
it's not going to get you so I'm going
to pass it on only three more things I
think I went through this in like record
time sorry if I'm talking insanely fast
this is a it's like a pen matte cream
thing from what's the brand nude Stix
it's pretty but it's one of those ones
that when you go to dark and you're not
gonna have really even pigmentation it
just looks patchy and I feel like that's
what's gonna happen with this I've never
used it since I got it and I just don't
want it anymore so I'm getting rid of it
this is a NARS lip pencil in the color
Cruella I have two of them so I'm giving
one away I will not go through two of
them so I just need one and last this is
a lip surgence by Tarte and it's in
like orange color it's not that it's not
pretty I just know I won't use it
because I haven't used it and I'm just
I'm ready to get rid of it so that is
everything I'm getting rid of tons of
stuff I feel so so happy about where I'm
at I might just throw in the nail polish
is really fast since it's not too too
long I just don't really want to like go
through help like every color of this
because it's just so boring to me but
like literally this entire thing is full
of nail polish I'm getting rid of all
the rest of my julep polishes a ton of
my China Glaze because I don't really
use China Glaze
I choose my other polishes over that
some of these Sally Hansen ones from
like a collection from a summer or two
ago I've just never really worn I
focused on getting rid of a lot of the
nail polishes that are really really
dark that basically all look black and
maybe have like a sheen or something I
just like fun colors and so if you know
I can have a couple like dark ones but
mostly I use like pastels and like
glitters and like fun bright colors so I
don't really need like 700 of the dark
ones I think a lot of those I bought
because other people really like them so
then like I would hear them recommend it
and then I just go and purchase it and
be like oh this is the one they talked
about in that video alright bye and that
was stupid I don't know this is like a
little top coat or base coat on we know
what it is I got it from Sephora I was a
hundred point crack and I don't want it
I have a lot of SC in here - just like
boring colors I don't want so I'm
passing those on I don't know what else
to say about this stuff I think that's
kind of it I don't know I know now
looking at the camera and you can hear
all the bottles clinking but really
happy I mean that feels really good and
it's just like there's no way I'm gonna
go through all these polishes and I have
like 700 it's too much guys too much I
think what triggered this declutter when
I was just in the mood to I wanted to
like give stuff to my mom and to my
brother's girlfriend when I meet them in
Vegas I just thought that would be like
a fun way to like give them stuff and
also you know give me a reason to
declutter but I watched some people's
really big makeup collections and they
just got to me and I just don't want
that much
like I just don't I just want more of an
edited collection I want anything that's
in my drawers to be something that I
actually enjoy using I just felt that
way a lot today so I made really good
progress in my collection also something
I was thinking is just like I can't even
justify getting one new thing but of
course I'm going to want new things so I
need to get rid the only way I can get
my collection down is to get rid of
stuff and as much as that hurts I just
have to get rid of things I don't use if
I want to bring in things that I feel
like I will use or then we're just back
to the same situation of having a
million things so I definitely feel
better anyway that was just like a
really big inspiration for me and just
like a motivator for me and I just feel
really good about this I want to
continue to just really hold myself up
to a standard of where I want to be like
I want to not have like no makeup I just
want to have stuff I really really love
and not have a bunch of stuff I don't
use at all so I feel really good I hope
this inspires you guys to maybe take a
second look at your collection and I
hope too that you guys realize I have
declutter so many times it is such a
process seriously because like I just
did a clutter I think at the beginning
of the year and you know that three
months ago I wouldn't have gotten rid of
any of this stuff but then now I am so
you know if you're just starting out or
you know you feel like oh you could do
better do what you can then come back to
it and when you feel better or when you
feel like you can really tackle some
stuff and I think just don't get
discouraged because trust me if you go
back again to the videos I'll leave down
below so you can reference some of this
stuff you will realize that like I
didn't want to get rid of like anything
actually back then but you know any
progress is some progress and look at
where I'm at today because I kept going
so anyway I feel really happy I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
