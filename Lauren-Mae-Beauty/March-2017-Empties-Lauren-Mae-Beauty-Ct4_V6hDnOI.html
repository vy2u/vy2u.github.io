Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be another empties video
sadly I have no makeup this month I'm
really trying to like get my button gear
though because I really want to have a
good makeup empties video if you guys
haven't seen my 2016 makeup empties I
finally film that so I will leave a link
down below if you haven't checked it out
but anyway let's just get into these
products I'm gonna go over and them
since we don't have makeup to start with
lots of your stuff though I don't I
don't know what it is about the hair
stuff the first thing I have here is
from Rusk and this is a texture dry
finishing spray dry like texturizing
volumizing sprays are some of my
favorite things to use I have very fine
thin hair y'all know I just like using
these to help give some texture and
volume and a little bit of grit to my
hair I mostly do a bun like this is what
I look like every day I'm alive guys I
don't like put a bun for the videos and
I don't change my hair for videos
because this is me this is 100% me
anyway I love using these but this one
is not my favorite out of all the ones
they use I probably suggest the Moroccan
oil one probably though because of the
smell I don't know I haven't found one
that I just think is the best actually I
really like the unite one that's
probably my favorite um anyway I did not
enjoy this one the smell was a little I
don't know weird it was sweet but a
little too sweet for me and it kind of
spritzed out sporadically like no matter
how much you shook it I feel like it
wasn't spraying evenly anyway it's not
my favorite but it was pretty cheap it's
a mint product it wasn't the worst it's
not the best speaking of the Moroccan
oil dry texturizing spray this is the
Moroccan oil one I love the smell of
Moroccan oil it just is so good I used
this in my kit and also on myself and I
do enjoy this I would repurchase this it
was nice
more Moroccan oil stuff this is the
volumizing conditioner I used up the
shampoo in my last empties and I'm
really proud of myself for finishing
this so close to when I finished up the
shampoo like you guys know I finished
shampoos faster than conditioners this
smells so good and I feel like this
actually worked with my hair I don't
feel like this left my hair overly
greasy and I really I just really
enjoyed it this is what made my hair
smell so good though this smells way
stronger than the
Jambu does I definitely want to
repurchase this I will definitely
repurchase this at some point in the
future it smells so good
and it works but it smells so good I
have more hair stuff here this is a hair
spray I could not think of hair spray
for like the longest time I had to
refill not like 7 times this is from
Sebastian and this is the shaper plus I
like this ok this doesn't give too hard
of a hold which is nice
depending on what you want though I
switched up and use the Kenner one but I
would definitely buy this again I
thought it was nice and it's not too
expensive but it's a good product I have
two different micellar waters here this
is the regular Garnier micellar water I
feel like this is my favourite micellar
water out of everything I've tried I
feel like I like the Bioderma better but
it's just more expensive so it's not
worth it to me this is really nice I
really like it this one on the other
hand I don't like as much this is the
one that has like the dual phase and you
shake it out I just don't like the
feeling the sleeves on my eyes I do
think it removes makeup easier but the
greasy feeling is not worth it to me I'd
rather take longer and use this one so
you just have to decide what what works
for you but I just absolutely I just
hate that feeling in your eyes whether
it's like a film it drives me nuts it
took every ounce of strength in my body
to finish this seriously oh my gosh
seriously there is just like so much
hair stuff in here I have a batiste
y'all know I love it so good me and Sam
use that now this is something I
absolutely love and I finished it up
this is the puff me volumizing cloud
mist now out of all the volumizing
products that I suggest this is number
one I love this this you likes you do
this and it puts a cloud in it's like
those texturizing powders but instead of
having to like put it in your hair or
like tap it into your head you can just
spray it so it just makes it so much
easier I do believe that big sexy hair
is coming out with a similar product I
saw it on octoly and part of me wanted
to get it or asked if I could like try
it out anyway I don't know more brands
are coming out with it so they're not
like the only one anymore but it's so
good I had my mom buy two of them for me
so I am stopped I have two packages of
cut
I did not like these ones they just fell
apart really easily I did get the Swiss
burrs from Costco they were finally in
stock with them so I'm gonna be trying
those out I'll let you guys know if I
like them or not I have a bad memory of
using Swiss pers but I feel like they
were the ones that weren't like
encapsulated and the ones from Costco
would look like they are so I'm gonna
use them tonight we'll see how they work
I have some hand soaps here these are
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the
sunrise mimosa and this is the white
peach Chardonnay they were both in the
foaming which I don't know I just have a
love-hate relationship with the foaming
I love that you can use them to like the
last drop because they I don't know you
can just use them the whole way through
but they go so fast I feel like I go
through soaps so much faster when it's
in this form scent wise neither of these
were my favorite so I probably won't
repurchase these scents again but they
were okay well while they lasted but in
general again you guys know I love Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works soaps this is something
that's basically used up but I kind of
just had to give up on it because I was
gonna like freak out in the shower every
time I use this this is from nooks and
this is their shower oil I got this for
gratis when I worked at my old beauty
job I was so excited to try this out I
wanted this to be like the L'Occitane
shower oil you know thing definitely not
this is just normal shower gel like
nothing moisturizing about it at all if
anything I feel like it's like less
moisturizing than other shower gels I
have that don't even claim to be
moisturizing the smell on this smells
horrible I hate the smell so much I know
a lot of people like the scents in this
range like the oil people love know this
smells like Grandma this smells like
well every time I use this every every
time I use this the more you use it the
more I was just like couldn't stand it
okay but anyway besides that I could
have handled it I could have finished it
up this is so hard to squeeze out it
hurt my hand to squeeze out this product
so I just gave up like eventually I was
like it's not worth it like it's getting
so low it's harder and harder the last
product there is in this to squeeze out
so I gave up on it imma throw it away
I'm probably down here though I mean I
used most of it it's just like who has
time like if I'm taking a shower like
let's go we gotta go we got some
variations on toothpaste this
this is the optic white Colgate this is
our favorite one but I had to these
little Sensodyne when my mom was in town
she left these so they had like barely a
nice left I just wanted to finish them
up I actually really like the way this
tastes and feels in my mouth so I
wouldn't mind buying this this is the
fresh breath scent it's nice I really
liked these actually I'm considering you
know trying them out again this wouldn't
be an empties video if I didn't have
some makeup wipes in here these are the
FPL whites and these are actually
different than my normal ones I don't
know these just say facial cloths I
don't really like this white package and
all these are my least favorite I've
ever tried they're not as like wet as
the normal ones they also have a very
perfumed scent so I don't really like
them I don't suggest those out of like
all the different versions and then
these ones were just like a little wet
and wild pack these have ten makeup
wipes in it I got this at the dollar
store this was okay these were really
big compared to like the FEL ones I
don't know I wouldn't repurchase them
they're nice to have maybe for like a
travel kit I would keep them or
something but I wouldn't like to seek
them out I have some baby shampoo here
this is so old I bought this a very very
long time ago to clean my brushes with I
personally don't like using baby shampoo
to clean my brushes I don't think it
gets the product out as well as it
should I really need something to break
down like creams and foundations and so
I use these on my personal brushes to
use it up I really love the beauty
blender cleanser or castile soap whether
it's in liquid form or in the like bar
soap over this so that's what I will
repurchase but I know everyone has like
their method of cleaning brushes I have
a few little skincare samples that I
used up from Bioderma this is the
corrective care for enlarged pores it
was like kind of a moisturizer
definitely made me feel a little matte
but I don't think it kept me matte
throughout the day I really feel like I
just need a bigger size to really know
how I feel about both of these products
this is a serum and it's for
moisturizing it's felt nice on the skin
but again I really want a bigger size to
know if it'd be worth it or not so I
feel like I just would have to bite the
bullet on either one of those - no but
I'm not opposed to it I kind of want to
explore it a little bit more mostly I
would need to look into the price to
kind of see how I felt about it but I
think these would be nice in my kit just
a couple more things this is something
I'm really happy
have in here this is something I'm
really happy to have in here it's from
Bath and Body Works it's one of the wall
flowers this was in the like eucalyptus
lemon or mint lemon scent it was really
nice to have this in my kitchen I have
Tiki Beach going I have so many of these
to use up and I'm just trying to work
through them we have kind of a small
apartment rent is really expensive in LA
so if you have a big apartment good for
you and just enjoy it if you love other
places in the country because my
goodness it's crazy here anyway that
being said sometimes I feel like this
can take over my entire apartment if I
haven't plugged in and I don't want that
or I want to like burn a candle that's
like a total different scent so that's
why it's kind of hard for me to you see
stuff but I just decided like to just do
it and I've really been enjoying it
actually so I used up one of those and
I'm gonna try to like continue to switch
those out and use those up I have a
floss here we're really going out of
order this is my favorite one from reach
I suggest getting them at the dollar
store they have the best price they're a
dollar is what you should pay for that
something I guess that's kind of makeup
related this is a little sponge I got
this with the Physicians Formula
ready set Instagram I don't know
whatever that concealer is this just
sucks and I already mentioned in my
makeup declutter that I don't like
little sponges like this I just don't
think that there's any value to them
because the Beauty Blender or even the
Real Techniques sponge really can get
into all those places I don't think that
you need a smaller sponge I think it's
just kind of gimmicky and just a way for
you to buy more product anyway last item
here this is kind of a random one but I
wanted to bring it up this is the hair
skin and nail gummies from nature's
bounty I got this from Costco and I got
this because I have fine thin hair and
I'm really scared that at some point in
my life I'm just going to go bald just
when I am bald mostly refer back to this
video and know that I called it so this
is like my attempt to kind of like try
to fight that maybe not lose as much
hair in the shower all the time I did
enjoy this I definitely want to
repurchase them I think these were like
$11 and change which i think is very
much worth it me and Sam had two of
these a day for the most part we tried
to stay really consistent with it I
didn't
anything like amazing but I also didn't
see anything negative so that's a
positive
I have heard someone else in the
community talk about those two so I do
think that they're really nice if you're
looking for something that's affordable
but you can actually add to your routine
to hopefully just like help give you a
little bit extra benefit that's
everything from my empties video I hope
you guys are having a great rest of your
day I want to say really fast thanks to
all the new subscribers hi guys thanks
so much for like you know come in and
join in the community I really
appreciate it and I see all your guys's
comments I'm trying really hard to
respond back to everyone that I can
right now it's not my forte but I'm
going I'm trying anyway that's
everything guys thanks so much for

video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
