video is gonna be my March favorites I
don't have a ton of March favorites not
that I wasn't loving stuff but I've just
been using a lot of the same stuff and I
also haven't been purchasing a ton of
stuff which pat on the back overall
except to have a haul video which I'll
link down below so some of that stuff
it's just kind of relatively new so I
can't like include all of that or
something in March favorites cuz I
didn't I didn't get it until like really
recently but I thought I would share
with you what I did love and just let
you know kind of what's been what's been
capturing my heart lately so I'm just
gonna go into this first these are at
the lorac Pro palette I have the 1 and
the 2 I also have the lorac mega Pro but
I have that in my kit for school these
are just amazing palettes if you guys
have never seen them mine are altura but
I absolutely love these I hit pan on the
nude shade and they're just great you
can make any look with these palettes
and they're just beautiful I especially
love the colors
nectar Rose a mocha on the buff color
light brown basically like this half of
the palette I especially love but I just
think they're great I also love that if
I'm trying to use a different I don't
know I shadow or something I can just
pull in some of the matte colors from
this or the shimmer shade for a
highlight or whatever and it gets the
job done I think they're perfect if
you're looking for a palette these
really are I feel like the most
inclusive ones they have everything
you're gonna need matte wise everything
you're gonna need shimmer wise and then
some fun pops of color I definitely
think you should invest in those ones
before any palettes especially if you're
starting out so love love love so much
love for these and I've especially
brought them out I did a tutorial using
this one which I'll link down below as
well and I love them there's nothing
else to say really some other shadows I
have been loving are these lines by
Steeler Aussie I just hauled these I
know but I've been using them every
single day since I got them and they're
just they're so beautiful I love how big
the pans are and I'm just I
really I'm impressed with these I bought
these for really cheap they were like a
dollar ad and like 250 are already
formats 254 shimmers with my discount
and I kind of expected them to be like
rare okay but not like super great but
they've been so amazing I have
especially loved these three colors here
I've used them every single day
since I caught them and they're just
beautiful I feel like they blend really
nicely I don't know what the quality for
the price just blows my mind so I've
been really really liking these ones so
much so much I also wanted to talk about
this foundation this is the number seven
beautifully matte foundation in the
color cool vanilla this is my absolute
favorite full coverage foundation
drugstore or high-end I haven't really
tried that many high-end foundations but
I just love this I think it's like right
around thirteen ninety nine and I get
mine at Walgreens but I just think it's
so beautiful I usually mix this with
another like lighter shade since this is
quite cool toned and dark though I don't
know I always mix it with just a little
bit of a lighter foundation and it just
is so beautiful it covers so well and
I've been doing a lot more tinted
moisturizers and then I came back to
this and I just thought man this is what
I'm talking about so I've really been
liking like a full done up face lately I
just think I look so glamorous and
pretty not to be conceited or anything I
just really I like when I look in the
mirror halfway throughout the day I look
at myself like girl you look good okay
like didn't realize you were looking
that good today so this helps me feel
that way and I just think it's a great
value for money too on this one and then
with that I have been using the beauty
Wonder this is puffed up because I just
washed it I never liked the Beauty
Blender before I tried it once I got it
in a pop sugar bag or box like so long
ago like so long and it just sat there
never used for I want to say like a year
year and a half
because I just didn't care like I didn't
care about this I thought it was kind of
stupid and everyone loves it and I just
like it's a sponge it's a freaking
sponge but I really do like it and I've
realized lately I think why I like this
so much is my skin I've noticed I don't
like when I apply my foundation with a
brush or my concealer with a brush
especially when I was using that really
thick stick concealer it just it just
doesn't look right it looks cakey and
patchy and it picks up product from
before and puts it somewhere else it
just doesn't look good I'm just not
happy with it right now and so I've been
using my fingers to blend stuff in like
the warmth of my fingers to help like
just let it sink into the skin and this
gives me that but it's like faster and I
don't like using my fingers I feel gross
when I'm like touching my foundation and
all that so I've really just been loving
this it's been working for me and I it
is kind of dirty but I feel like the
cleanser which is another favorite I
also got this in one of those pop sugar
boxes this cleanser got out the color in
the foundation and this so well I'm
really happy with it
and I'm not saying it's the best
cleanser for like brushes and stuff but
I feel like for the Beauty Blender it
really it did a decent job like this
looks way nicer than it did that's for
dang sure so I've really been liking
those and those were like a surprise
favorite I was not expecting to like
these I mean I was just ready to just
give up on this guy forever but I love
her now which is so cute and she works
so well I don't think that I would use
these on clients because sometimes I
feel weird about sanitation with this
but then I just forget about it and use
it and then I love it anyway I love that
in the cleanser so if you haven't tried
it and you want to spend a lot of money
on a sponge you can try it I haven't
tried any other sponges so once that
one's just kind of like done for I'm
going to try other sponges and see if I
like them better because I don't know if
it's just this beauty blender or if it's
just sponges I know everyone
there's nothing like it but I'm gonna
try to find some last make up item yeah
this is really short sorry this is a
really short one guys um this blush this
blush it was in my Hall and it's
absolutely beautiful it's Neapolitan
lane by girona Tarantino and I loved it
I loved it so much I think you should
get it
find it hunt it down and get 80 of them
there's it's just so pretty it looks so
good on my skin and it just gives me
that tiny bit of color I mean it barely
gives me any actual like pink color
because it is quite nude but ooh I'm
like so in love I've used this every
single day except today because I was
like Lauren you can't use it again you
can't use it again but I will always
have this in my makeup drawer I love it
I love it love it love it and it's great
it's great quality it feels so silky
smooth I've never heard about it why
it's amazing it's great get it get it
just trust me
but John spent a lot of money on it I
would spend a lot of money on it
I just got it for so cheap but even if I
paid full price like I feel like this
blush would be worth full praise it's so
good I'm gonna stop talking about it
okay and then this is the last thing
it's so short like item I guess I can
maybe think of some other brand Oh
things um but this is another hand cream
I had a hand cream last month I have a
hand cream this month I'm telling you
lotions have become one of my favorite
things lately but this is the Codel e
hand and nail cream and this just works
really nicely but I will tell you that I
love the smell the smell of this it
smells like mac fix+
meets your on Soarin over California and
you're going through the oranges put
those sins together and it is this
beautiful creature it smells so good
it's like this citrusy but still light
oh I can't even handle it Sam it's like
okay freak Oh like no it's also good so
I will definitely be repurchasing this
so this one and the lots of time which
was a matter one those are
like in my two favorites I don't know
maybe I have so many hand creams so who
knows maybe I'll I love every single one
but just the smell of this it's
beautiful it is so beautiful and I love
it
definitely if you can somehow sample
this I don't even know I got this in
France so I haven't like seen it here
but it's not like I've been looking for
it I love it though so good so so good
other than that I can't think of any
favorites I love school still I really
love it and I feel so much better about
like bass mixing foundations I was
struggling with that a lot and now boom
baby I can get your color any time of
the day and that feels really good
and I'm just excited to move on I'm
halfway done
and I have my midterm tomorrow so have
one with this class I guess is what I
mean to say there's six classes but
anyway I'm really loving school still I
also wanted to just mention like I
finished Dexter
and this isn't unfavorite I did not like
the season finale or like the series
finale like the end of the frickin show
I don't know I mean I'm not gonna spoil
anything for anyone if you haven't
watched it even though it is an older
show but I would be so mad if someone
spoiled it for me um but it's just on my
favorite so that's all I'm going to say
about that I was like please help me
please and I think that's it that's all
I'm gonna talk about in this one I don't
want to force anything
be natural au naturale and that's
everything guys I will see you in my
next video which I'm gonna film another
one I'm feeling three videos yeah girl
go girl and I'll see you in my next one
I'm so creepy okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
