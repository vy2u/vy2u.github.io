Lauren today I have a ton of videos to
film for you guys I am going to be on
set this next weekend starting tomorrow
and I just will not be able to film for
a while so I thought I might as well
just get them all of the way and there
are a lot of like updates and things
that I need to get done for the month of
March and things like that so first off
I know March mini madness that happened
last month I was sick for a good week
and a half it was one of those
sicknesses that just like clings on to
your soul and will not leave so it took
a long time for me to get better but I
am better now and I wasn't able to do a
halfway update point for you guys from
our 20 madness so I apologize but I just
I was too sick I I really could not be
bothered and I just felt so ill and it
wasn't worth it so I have a finale for
you guys a couple days late but at least
it's happening right so let's get into
what I finished first and then I'll show
you the rest
I believe I did finish 24 items out of
32 so not a hundred percent but I still
feel pretty content with that progress
these are things I probably wouldn't
have used at all in March if I hadn't
had joined this project so I'm really
happy about that
Lindsey as you started this project I
will have her channel link down below so
you guys can check her out and I'm very
thankful to her for like creating this
awesome project for us to just use up
our stuff and be excited about using up
extra products we have lying around the
first thing I used up was the glam glow
super mud clearing treatment this is
something I have had in the past and a
full-size and I use this as a spot
treatment and that's how I used it for
the month I really like it that way it
was just a way to get another one out of
my collection because I do have quite a
few of these the other flammable mask I
had was a thirsty mud
I enjoyed this but sadly I put this on
when I was sick so I really didn't get
the full experience of the coconut coz I
could not taste or smell anything for
about three days like at all like 100%
and then the rest of it was still kind
of you know in and out for the days
after that so I enjoyed this I would not
purchase this in the full-size I'd
rather have the other one but it was
nice for a one-time use in the last mask
I used
this is the cucumber gel mask from Peter
Thomas Roth I kind of don't remember
this one so to me it's nothing special I
would not repurchase but I am glad that
I used it since I saved this for so long
I had to deborah lippmann the stripper
to go pads in here I only have one to
show you because my mom used one and
threw it away when she was here for my
graduation so this got done I enjoy this
I think these are really nice I think
they're pricey for what they are but
there is a convenience about this if you
were to travel or if you just can't have
all the supplies to take off your
nail-polish this is all in one package
ready to go it's saturated enough for
all of your nails so potentially I would
think about purchasing this or I would
suggest these to someone who is looking
for something that's easy for traveling
if they want to change their nail polish
out but I am glad they're out of my
collection if I wanted them I'd rather
just go buy them than have them sitting
around cluttering up my stuff
I had a few like foundation concealer
products so first I had the YSL Touche
cloth this is a number two I really did
enjoy this I don't know if it's worth
the money but for the sample I thought
it looked really nice it was this nice
like sheer skin like coverage but it
still did something it wasn't like it
was so sure I didn't notice it I really
did enjoy this and if I had extra money
and was looking for something I might
get a sample of this again to then maybe
get it and then I had three like
foundation products these are just
really gross so I'm sorry I did not use
all the product in these every single
one of these is way too dark for me so I
had to mix it with my foundations I
already had that her lighter and so I
did that with each of these one time and
then I just realized like it would take
so long just to get through a sample
packet because of how dark they are that
it's just not worth it and so I was like
I'm just gonna throw them away I'm not
gonna use them I'd rather be using up
other things in my collection so these
are gonna be gone this is the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer I honestly don't have an
opinion on it I think it's hard to give
an opinion on a foundation if you have
to mix it you don't really know how that
foundation performs by itself so I
really don't have an opinion on any of
these the Dior hydro life
BB cream this one was really pigmented
for a BB cream I can tell you that much
and
the most disgusting ones I'm so sorry
this is the girl on lingerie - PO I
honestly just didn't think any of these
were that special but again I was mixing
them so I feel like it's not a good
judge hold on my phone's ringing another
foil packet I used up this is the pneuma
scalp therapy exfoliator this is an
exfoliator for your scalp you use it in
the shower when you have shampoo on then
you put this on so you have that like
matrix to move around in and it's
supposed to scrub your scalp I was so
excited for this you guys know I was
like I don't know why I'm so pumped
about this but I was I wear a lot of dry
shampoo and I don't wash my hair every
day so I thought this would be kind of a
nice way to almost like you're
exploiting your skin on your face but
instead on your scalp and just get all
that junk out of my hair
disappointing I don't think there were
enough scrubby particles in this which I
mean I guess it's supposed to be gentle
and it's not like I want to put sand in
my hair but I would not purchase this I
was definitely disappointed which is so
sad I probably just had really high
hopes for it but I really wish it lived
up to him this is the Clarkes botanicals
anti puff eye cream I really did enjoy
this this felt like the rody al dragon's
blood hyaluronic night cream it felt
like a very similar consistency it also
felt like another product I used which
was from belief one of the I don't know
if it was the aqua balm or the other one
but it just has a very just like thick
but not but still gel like consistency I
really liked this I definitely thought
it was good if I had just like tons of
money I think this is like 70 or $80 for
the eye cream I would buy it I think
it's really nice I use it these skin
Iceland iPods these are really nice you
guys know I already like them I just
throw them in here to get rid of them I
think that's all the foil packets that I
finished let's go into the bigger items
I was able to use it both of the belief
products this is the moisturizing balm
and this is the aqua balm I cleaned him
out pretty good so I'm not sure if I'm
gonna be able to tell which one I liked
the most the moisturizing balm I think
is the one that has that really nice
consistency it's kind of like a gel but
it's really thick I really like this it
was very similar to again rody Al's
Dragon's Blood at night cream and then
the moisturizing balm was a little bit
thinner I felt like it spread easier on
the skin and I didn't need as much but
it wasn't as
raising so I really did like both of
these products I don't know what these
sell for but I thought they were nice if
I got another sample I would definitely
use it I don't know if I could purchase
or I don't know if I purchase but I did
think they were nice this is the bumble
and bumble full potential hair
preserving booster spray I have a few of
these samples just hanging around so I
want to use them up again I've reviewed
this a million times but it smells like
immense like Cologne or deodorant it's
okay I don't notice anything big
sometimes it burns my scalp if I feel
like I have like a cut on my scalp which
I know is weird but yeah anyway
there's that one I finished my UB
moisturizing cream I like this I would
definitely think about purchasing a
full-size because I use this on like my
inside because I use this in like my
nose crease I know that's another weird
thing but it gets really dry there for
whatever reason doesn't matter how much
I exfoliate so I do like to use this on
that area when I go to bed just to give
it extra moisture but right now I'm kind
of using lip balms and just different
things but once I run out of those
options I want to get this again this
was a Murad product this is the rapid
collagen infusion 8 reform I did really
like this this smelt though like kind of
like bleach or something it definitely
had a strange smell to me like it was
like a clean bleaching ish smell so I
mean I wouldn't purchase it but I'm glad
I got through the sample I finished up
the Bath and Body Works candle this was
a drenched apple flower surprisingly I
could kind of smell this but I really I
don't think you can smell something this
small it's just so tiny unless you had
it in like a really small bathroom or
somewhere in a really contained area
other than that I feel like it'll just
get lost in a big room I was able to
finish up both of the primers from ziwei
so one was the anti-aging moisture
primer and the other one was the anti
blemish matte primer
I didn't notice saying especially matte
with this it was okay
I wouldn't purchase it and then for the
anti-aging one I thought this is nice
for like a moisturizing primer so affect
something you're looking for it was nice
but you could always probably use lotion
I feel like so anyway I'm glad I got
through them and got them out of my
collection because they are relatively
new so they were like in an
really fast but they're not like star
products I would repurchase or go out
and try to find two more makeup items I
finished I know y'all
I finished the Kat Von D celebutard
lipstick this took me a really long time
to finish it's been in many of projects
I'm so happy to see it gone
the little nub there that's just the
plastic and I can't apply this on my
lips anymore I am NOT digging in it's
done it's over with so happy to have a
little lipstick out I've never finished
a lipstick whether wait maybe I have I
don't know if I finish the lipstick but
I don't care I'm still really happy and
the other product I finished was the
lash domination from bareMinerals
I did enjoy this this did smudge though
on my bottom lashes which is kind of a
bummer just that I don't want to have to
use two mascaras if I got another sample
of this I'd probably use it but I don't
know if I purchased I just really like
the Urban Decay perversion if I'm gonna
go with a high-end mascara at the moment
so it still was nice but it wasn't I
wouldn't buy it I think that is
everything for what I like 100% used up
now are things where I'll just show you
the progress I made this is the joy Co
instant refresh dry shampoo I am so
close I'm probably like here that's
where it feels in the container I tried
really hard on this this does not help
actually make your hair look clean so
that makes it really difficult to use
when I reach for a dry shampoo I need it
I need it that's why I'm using it so
this one I tried using just as texture
and other things and just kind of like
sprayed it in my hair plus braid my
batiste so I'm so close I'm almost done
and I'll finish this later but it didn't
quite make this is a Jew aura candle net
body cream I really really really like
this I actually only used it as a hand
cream so I still have a good bit in
there especially if I continue to use it
as a hand cream this smells so so good
if you ever have the chance to smell it
I definitely suggested it almost all's
like coconut but it's not it's a total
different scent it just smells so good I
love it this body cream just feels so
luxurious at least on the hand so I can
only imagine on the body a little bit
goes a long way and it just it just
smooths
the skin so nicely but doesn't feel
greasy it's really really nice I really
liked this and I noticed that even on my
hands like the next day my hands were
softer and I was like gosh my hands feel
so soft and I was like it was the first
night I use this as a hand cream so I
really like this I would definitely
consider purchasing this if I had no
lotions this is the hand cream in sugary
from malicious it's just a little sample
I'm about halfway I've only used it once
but there's really not a lot of product
in here so I just didn't use it it was
in my purse and just got lost in the
mess to Justin I didn't use it except
for that one time this is the hand
sanitizer from Bath and Body Works an
apricot mango I got about halfway done I
believe this was full-size or 100% full
when I started so it's some progress not
the most I tried again sometimes it just
gets lost in your person it's not
something I use this as needed so if I
don't need it I'm not going to use it
these are the eye pads from all check em
D I'm throwing these away I think I
didn't use these because I'm scared to
use them because I've had them for a
really long time so I'm just throwing
them away they're really old and I just
don't even want to put them by my eyes
so I've realized that why not using them
this whole time
so I'm just going to be throwing these
away this is my DKNY rollerball this is
in my NY I basically got half way with
it this I could have easily finished but
I just kind of started it late and again
I feel like this month with me being
sick there were just I was like a good
week and a half I didn't want to make up
I didn't film I didn't go out like I
literally for a while was in the house
like four days straight like I didn't
even leave one time so I just feel like
that's why I didn't use this plus I'm
trying to use a different perfume so I
need to finish this it won't take long
but it did not finish it in the timeline
two more items and then we'll be done
with this this is a product from Josie
Maran the argan oil I have quite a few
samples of this now I started with that
line and I got to about here so I didn't
get very far and the reason I stopped
using this this is gonna be gross
tonight I don't want you to judge me
I just realized there was like this
stuff I don't even know how I found this
out and how I didn't realize it
there but I think that this is like bad
and I almost want to say like there was
just stuff in this like around the
outside edges or not the outside I just
like inside around the rim I didn't even
notice that to the day I notice that I
went into my backups and realized that
this is a darker color than those ones
other ones are like clear and this one
is like tinted and I just didn't even
realize that that was bad I couldn't
smell most the month and I didn't notice
like a really off scent really like it
doesn't smell off to me so I don't
really know freaked me out I didn't
break out at all but I definitely don't
think it's just like oh it's just
colored I think like this is someone
else's home now hmm
anyway I'm done talking about this I'm
throwing this in the trash and I am
really grossed out by it so make sure
you check these because that is kind of
gross and this is a hundred percent
organic so it can definitely go bad oh
yeah the last item here this is my pur
Lisse a pre-release I don't know BB
cream and this is in the color medium
this is too dark for me but I have been
using this with my Revlon Colorstay
whipped foundation and that's really
been helping me use up both of them at
the same time so I'm about like halfway
here I just had so many foundations I
feel like I was using plus I really
liked using a powder foundation that's
why I didn't finish this I just found
that winning combination kind of at the
like last week of the month so it just
didn't work out to finish it I forgot to
film this with the rest of my video
because it fell on the floor but this
was another thing used up for March mini
madness this is the Marc Anthony
hydrating coconut oil shea butter deep
nourishing conditioning treatment this
lasted me for a really long time I think
I got a good like eight uses out of this
minimum I did really enjoy it I thought
it worked really well it's not really
nice and it didn't weigh my hair down so
I will be continuing to use with the
other masks I have and I'm glad that I
actually used one again from generation
Beauty which was pretty recent
so another item kind of in and out
pretty fast those are all the products
that's on my progress I felt really
great about this project I am so glad to
be getting rid of so many of those
stupid little samples and I
just learned like I always say just to
not get the foil samples I don't want
them I almost don't even care what it is
like unless it's the YSL Touche clot
maybe I'll get it but other than that I
don't really want them I don't need them
I'd rather have like one deluxe sized
mini for every like hundred packet
samples like I don't even want them so I
hope that you guys did well in your
March 20 madness and I hope you're just
doing well in life and I will see you in
the next video so many videos bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
