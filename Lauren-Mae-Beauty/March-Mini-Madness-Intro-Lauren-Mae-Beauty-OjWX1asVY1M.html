Lauren I just filmed this whole video
and I didn't even record it so we're
gonna try this again hopefully I'm just
better at it this time right so this is
going to be a month challenge this is
March mini madness this was started by
lindsay's al I think is how you're gonna
how you say her last name I don't know
for sure but i will leave her channel
link down below she came up with this I
thought it was really fun as soon as I
watched that video I was like that
sounds like something I'd really enjoy
doing it's a shorter project only a
month just kind of like a blitzkrieg all
your samples or as many samples as you
can she's doing 32 i'm also going to
continue that 32 number but you can do
however many you want to she got this
idea because she watches basketball I
don't watch basketball or her husband
does basketball and there's like a march
madness thing I don't really know about
that and I just thought why not try to
use up some samples so I'm going along
with it I definitely think that any of
you guys who want to I and definitely do
again her original like intro to this
whole idea is linked down below
definitely check it out and see if
something you want to do I am
pre-recording this so all of these items
that i picked i am going to be starting
on the first of march and i'm gonna go
until the end of march and see what I
can get done i picked a mix of foil
sample packets as well as many sizes i
did a great job last year on using up a
lot of minis but since jen beauty I feel
like I have so many more than before so
these are not all makeup but I just I'm
excited to try to like just really just
in and out get these done as fast as I
possibly can and just move some clutter
out of my collection in a really short
amount of time doing this all over again
is such it takes a lot of work I just
talked about 32 prick and staples again
so I'll just I'm going in no particular
order just so I can get them done you
guys know I've been working really hard
to get rid of my foil packets and to not
keep them but there are a few that I've
lingered on because I really have been
wanting to try them so i'm using this
month a month of march to really focus
in and use these things up find out if I
like them and just get rid of everything
that I can so I have three different
foundation type things here this is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer I've heard a lot of really
good things about this so I really want
to try
out this is the girl on lingerie depoe I
don't know if that's how you say it um
but I'm excited to try this this is a
super high-end foundation so why not try
to see if I like it before potentially
buying it not that I've been looking
into it but you know this is D or hide
your life BB cream I don't know the
color on this I cannot find it but I do
enjoy BB creams and lately I've been
going for a lighter look for my
foundation so I thought this would be
fun to try these are the skin iceland
hydro cool firming eye gels i really
like these I've used up two of these
single packs before and I think this is
my last one I definitely would
repurchase these already I know that so
I just want to get through my last like
single use one and then know that I use
them they feel so good under the eye if
you're crying the night before you had a
late night or you just feel like raw and
read sometimes my eyes are really
sensitive these just feel so amazing i
really like these i have another ipad
type of thing these are the owl check
MDD puff iPads I've had these for a
really long time so I don't know if
they're still good we'll see but I
thought it'd be fun to compare them
against the skin Iceland ones and see
which ones I like better this is more of
a deluxe sized sample item this is the
Murad rapid collagen infusion I believe
it's like a serum so that's what I'm
going to use it as and I'm excited i
really do like me right products
everything i've tried for them i really
liked some more sample packets this is
the glam glow thirsty mud mask I've
never tried this though it does smell
super delicious so I thought why not try
this out another glam glow mass this is
the super mud clearing treatment I uses
as a spot treatment so I thought why not
in the month of March just use this on
any blemishes I get and just use it up
that way i do prefer it as a treatment
like that because it's so expensive i
feel like you're getting your money's
worth out a bit more and the last mask
for my face this is the Q covered gel
mask from peter thomas roth I've wanted
to try this for a long time so this
month is the month to try everything
I've ever wanted to try in a foil packet
I have two of the deborah lippmann
stripper on the go these are nail polish
remover pads that are saturated in these
packets I always held on to these
thinking I'm gonna you know paint my
nails on vacation and I'm not going to
ever do
I don't even paint them at home when I
have a ton of time so I'm just going to
use these up this month instead of using
regular acetone and just get them get
them gone I have an eye cream cheese up
this is the clarks botanicals aunty puff
eye cream I've only heard really good
things about this and I thought why not
i've been using eye creams in the
daytime when I put my moisturizer on my
face I'll put an eye cream on just so my
makeup goes on better so I'm going to
switch out the origins one i have been
using and use this one up for however
long it lasts this is a YSL to shake lot
in number two I don't know if I've tried
this before I feel like I've had the
sample in the past but I'm excited to
try it it's a super raved about product
and i don't know i don't think i'd
purchase it but we'll see maybe i'll be
super convinced after using this I think
this is the last like packet type of
thing this is the marc anthony hydrating
coconut oil shea butter conditioning
treatment who i want to try this out
because i did get a couple different
masks from generation beauty and i just
want to see if that's even something i
like this will probably seriously give
me like three or four uses because i
have like two hairs on my whole head so
i am excited to try it and i hope it
smells really good that's the thing i'm
like most looking forward to i have a
tiny candle here from Bath and Body
Works this is in the scent drenched
apple flower this is one my favorite
sense ever it smells so good but they
have not brought it back in like two
summers at least not that I know of so
I've been saving it because of that but
I just want to get the mini gone I do
have a three wick so yeah but I'm just
gonna use this little gap it's the only
one I have and the scent throw on these
things suck I have two of the belief
products that i got from jen beauty this
is the moisturizing balm and this is the
Aqua bomb I thought why not try these
out this month and see if I like them
sooner rather than later I have a joico
instant refresher dry shampoo this is
like a travel size I don't really like
this dry shampoo so I know it's one of
those ones that will stick around and
I'll have for a long time so I'm using
this month as a way to force me to use
it up this is a body cream from jawara I
I don't know how you say it but this
smells so good it's in there candlenut
sent I really like this time I really
want to get the two different rollerball
oil perfumes that they have they smell
so good when you mix them together but
yeah I want to use this up and I might
his hand cream I might use it as a body
cream who knows we'll see as we go I'm
throwing in the 2g way primers that i
got from jen beauty this is the anti
blemish primer it's like the more
mattifying one and this is the
anti-aging moisturizing primer so we'll
see which one I like better i think i
like the mat one but i'm excited to try
them i'm a primer junkie i love primers
but I know if I don't like force myself
to use these up they will sit in my
primer door for a long time this is a
little hand cream from malicious and it
is in the scent sugar reef I love the
formulation of this hand cream so this
will be no big deal maybe I won't use
that other one as a hand crimson to have
this though good one Lauren this is a
mini mascara from bare minerals in the
lash domination I had this in a previous
project pan and I didn't get the chance
to use it in that one and I've been
opening other mascara since then so I
just want to use it up that's what the
brush looks like it's kind of hard I
don't think that the packaging on this
very very tiny mini is very good so I
just want to get it gone this is a
booster spray from Bumble and Bumble
this is supposed to like help keep your
hair longer I have a ton of these
because I took him for Sam and Sam will
never do some he doesn't keep up
anything he doesn't do any type of
maintenance stuff so I'm just going to
use them because they don't want them
sitting around and I know I won't use it
any other way if I don't force myself to
so that's why it's in this project this
is a BB cream from pur Lisse it is in
the shade medium I'm probably going to
have to mix it with another lighter
foundation but I'm excited to try it I
do again love BB creams this is a mini
rollerball from DKNY it's called my NY
yes and I thought why not get a little
tiny guy out um and get one of my roller
balls down for the year this is a mini
lipstick from kat von d this is the
celebutard one i have had this in a
previous project i think even two
projects I barely have any left so I
know I can do it I just want to power
through it this month and get this gone
this is the event d pigment this one I
might not be able to finish it just
depends on how you're supposed to use it
if you're supposed to use it as a spot
treatment for pigmentation it might be
hard but if it is one that you put all
over the face it won't be a big deal at
all so we'll see this is the UV
moisturizing cream
this is this is like kind of a give me
product you don't have much left I put
this on my nose in that area cuz I get
super dry and I do really like it for
that I would definitely think about
purchasing the full size of this but I'm
just gonna use this guy up and I know
for sure I can do this one this is a
josie maran argan oil it's the original
argan oil not like the lite version I'm
about here on it I have so many of these
little deluxe ice samples that I just
want to use them up I know that I don't
really like oils even though they feel
nice you're just not my preferred way to
moisturize my skin so I want to get as
many of these gone as it can and again I
kind of have to force myself to use
these up and I believe this is the 32nd
item in this whole thing this is the
bath and body works one of little Annie
backs in the scent apricot mango I have
so many of these hanging around and I
just want to use them up I don't think
I'm not picky when it comes to you
Hanson atty zur and some of these scents
are very strong and they're not exactly
what you want so I just want to use this
up this month I definitely think using
up a hand sanitizer in a month isn't a
big deal oh my gosh so many things I'm
excited that hopefully by the end of
march i'll have this will be just be a
bunch of trash instead of things to go
back in my collection i really hope that
you guys will join in on this definitely
check out Lindsey's channel and I will
see you guys on my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
