Lauren this is going to be my March top
five favorite I actually only picked
five this month I'm so proud of myself
for keeping it together and only picking
five let's just get into it these are
supposed to be like really short video
so let's get into my top 5 favorites for
March I'm sorry I'm so sorry but I love
this so it's been in like so many videos
I feel like we're I've talked about it
in every video but i love the peanut
butter and jelly palette from Too Faced
I don't think this palette is a
must-have palette like you don't have to
have it and I'm not saying I don't have
shadows that I could potentially dupe
from this palette but that doesn't mean
that I don't love it I love this palette
it is so beautiful it's so warm toned
which is my style hello I my eyes today
are very warm I just love this palette
and honestly my favorite shades from it
if I'm just being honest the ones that I
use all the time I really like that they
have a matte white shade in here called
extra creamy that 1i use just on the
base of my eyes to set my primer I can
also use it as a brow bone highlight I
just really like it and it is packed
really really hard which is nice like I
can still get on my brush but it's not
like flying everywhere which I enjoy a
surprise shade that i've been using a
ton of is bananas and it's like this
really pretty gold it's like a light
gold color it's not too yellow but it
still is a yellow gold but it's light
anyway it does have glitter in it but I
find if I tap my brush off that I don't
really get any fallout which I really
really appreciate because that was
something I was really scared about with
that shade but I've really been enjoying
that and I just use a flat shader brush
to pack it on the lid and then I do top
it off with a little bit of it put on my
finger and then spread on the lid peanut
butter the entire like reason this
palette was created is one of my
favorite shades i use that as a
transition color i can use it by itself
it gives enough definition by itself but
i just love that shade it's a matte
shade peanut brittle is really pretty
it's super pigmented very metallic i
guess i can swatch some of these that's
peanut brittle they're really pretty
color I've used it on the lid all over
the lid one time it is a darker look for
me I do usually like something
a brighter at least for every single day
but it's still a beautiful shade and I
do really like it I like it on the lash
line as well jelly is so pretty and I
will say this isn't the most pigmented
color as in its not like super opaque
but I feel like that's what it's
supposed to be it's kind of like a sheer
really pretty metallic purple that kind
of shines like pink and blue and
different lights so I'm okay with that
and I really enjoy that shame and
basically the lash it that I've been
loving from this is nuts about you and
it is a really pretty just dark brown
warm shade it's really really pretty it
is different than Sienna from my Anasazi
Beverly Hills but if you have Sienna I
would and you don't want to get this or
you're trying not to get this you can
use that color as well so I've really
been liking this I'll stop talking your
ear off about it but I am really happy
that I like this palette so much and
that I've already been using it so much
because it's the only palette i bought
this year so far and I'm just really
happy with this purchase I told you guys
I wanted to buy this one and the sweet
peach palette and I really don't think i
will buy the sweet peach palette a part
of me still really wants it but a part
of me is just kind of like there aren't
that many peach shades in it and there
are other things i can use and there's a
lot of brown shades and i already have a
million brown shade so this one i'm
really happy with because although
there's brown shades in it the brown
shades the most of the brown shades in
here are something that i really like to
use every single day anyway enough about
that one right but I just have been
loving it the next thing I wanted to
mention was a white eyeliner I just had
this in my travel makeup bag it's
something i've been using every single
day probably for the whole year so far
and it's just a white eyeliner this one
is a really creamy Kajal eyeliner from
stila in the color pearl it's just like
a creamy white color and I just really
been enjoying putting this on my
waterline um this is a nice one I'm not
saying I'll repurchase this one when
it's over I'll probably trying to get a
more inexpensive option but I do like
how creamy this one is a glide
really easily I don't have to tug at my
under eye and I just barely run it
across and it does a really good job of
just kind of brightening my eyes I also
sometimes I like to do a more rounded I
look I do have like kind of almond d I
shape like hooded eyes so sometimes if I
want to make them look like a little
more round instead of like long i can
use this and this really helps it also
helps just brighten and make them not
look as red when I want to use red
shadows around my eyes and I just have
found that I really like the difference
this makes it subtle but I can totally
tell and I really have been liking it so
that I just wanted to give a little
shout out to I've really been liking it
the next favorite number three our
myspace buns I think that's what people
call these right i don't know i call
them like double buns or space buns i
just love it this is such an easy look
and you probably have seen it a couple
times now but I just have been loving it
so it's easy and what I love about the
most is on third day hair where I feel
like I usually can't do anything with my
hair because it just looks so hideous I
can just put it in this and it's kind of
messy which is totally my style I am
totally fine with the messy hairstyle
and I just really have been liking it I
haven't been doing glitter roots with it
just because that is kind of more of a
production but I just have really been
liking it and I really like how it
almost looks well these are a little
uneven but even that I'm okay with but
it kind of looks like i have my hair and
like boxer braids and i just kind of
like that style and it's phil little
sassy I feel like fun and sassy and
flirty and cute in it and it's really
easy so I've just really been enjoying
it and I thought I'd give it a shout out
in this video as well two more things
the next thing I've really been loving
is a book this is possible side effects
by augusten burroughs and this is just a
hilarious book as you can see well I
don't know if you can see this is my
bookmark here so I only have that much
left so I've really been enjoying
reading this and it's just a bunch of
like I don't know if I can call them
essays but just little stories from his
life and he's just hilarious and I've
just really been enjoying it I also
really liked the format of this book
because they are little story so if you
only have a couple minutes you can just
10 pages and you don't have to feel like
you're you're forgetting this story
because they're all just little separate
stories and I like that and it kind of
like pushes me like okay how much is the
next one okay 10 pages I'll read the
next one too so I don't know for me as
I'm trying to read that something that's
important this isn't a new book by any
means um I don't one of the things I've
noticed on booktube is like everyone
reads and someone commented too but like
everyone reads like a lot of fantasy and
like young adult and although i do like
young at all as well I don't think young
adult is necessarily my style as nearly
as much or as it seems everyone else's
style is that so um anyway I really been
liking this and on Easter me and sam
went to the beach and we just went to
read and I actually ended up reading
this allowed to us because that's how we
are we like to like I think that's the
reason we're like movies so much is
because although we aren't like talking
to each other we're having like a shared
moment and then we can talk about that
film or how he felt about it all he
sings like a shared experience where is
if we're reading separate books it's not
a shared experience we're totally
different worlds and so when we were
laying there he was just like laying and
getting a tan and then I was reading
this aloud and that was just like a nice
fun moment for us it was funny and what
am I was kind of sad but um it was just
like a good moment and again just
enjoying this book he really enjoyed it
too I feel like this is very similar to
David Sedaris I'm not saying it's the
same but it's definitely a similar vein
I think they're both hilarious and okay
just been enjoying this the last
favorite is a fashion favorite and this
is a dress and I'm really close up so
you can't really tell but this goes
probably right mid thigh so I don't wear
it is just a straight up dress because I
am NOT trying to flash everyone and I
probably would flash everyone I wear it
with leggings if I'm wearing it out if
I'm at home I wear without a you know
leggings but I really like my gosh okay
I really like the cut of this dress it's
very high cut I was wearing this in the
video with my red lipstick on and I
basically want to wear it in every
single video because I just like the way
it looks and its sleep
like you know I like and I just have
really been loving this it's such a
simple piece and I even was considering
not getting it when i was at forever 21
which is where it's from because it was
like 1799 which isn't that expensive I'm
just cheap and I just was like am I
actually gonna wear it because that's
something I've noticed with myself as
like I just wear the same crap I do
honestly well I tried to print out today
and wear something I've had in my closet
for a long time but I where'd the same
stuff over and over and over and I just
was hoping if I was going to spend
almost twenty dollars on it especially
when I it's not like I had a ton of
money to spend on clothes that I would
actually wear it and I really been
enjoying it I really like the cut and
I'm kind of surprising like the tight as
much as I do because my boobs are
massive and sometimes with a cut so high
with big boobs it looks like you just
have one big boob going on and it can
just get a little dicey so I don't know
I've really been liking that and I like
it with myspace buns too it just looks
really cute and Sam agrees so um yeah
those are my five favorites for the
month I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you in the next one I
hope you're having a wonderful day bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
