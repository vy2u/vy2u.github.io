on a look I was wearing in my previous
chronic Sony's up in 2015 and also my
Sephora likes watch video a lot of
people like that look and i thought i
would do tutorial for you in the video i
mean i'm glad you guys liked it but my
eyeshadow looked really off i hope it
doesn't in this one but in real life it
was fine but i'm glad so many of you
guys liked it and i thought i would show
you how i got that look so if you want
to get this marsala rose gold luck then
just keep watching okay so how's your
guys can already tell i've already
primed my eyes i used my tart emphasize
cream shadow and shimmering golden beige
because i'm trying to use it up the
first thing i'm going to do is put this
dalasi steel aussie i'll put it down
below this eyeshadow in my crease just
to give us a little bit of definition
i'll be using this sigma e40 brush and
just loosely kind of padding that
padding loosely kind of crazy putting
that in the crease of my eye and this is
just going to give us a slight bit of
definition we're going to definitely be
built in colors up since we want it kind
of this blown out look and you guys can
kind of do whatever you want you talk to
you say my shadows i use but i'm just
kind of giving you an idea and you guys
can switch up the colors to and use like
the same technique but do you purples or
more rusty browns instead of more
actually am using kind of a rescue brown
um but yeah you could use like anything
like that you guys have in your
collection i think that you know you can
always make something work so yeah as
you can see it's just super light on my
eyes right now then i'm gonna go out go
in and kind of build that color up using
this shade here this is kind of like a
peachy creamy a little bit darker color
than the last one and if it not also the
same way in my crease and we're just
layering these colors so that it'll be a
more blended look and just
that in the same places see how already
it's warming up that crease so much i
love it again these shadows are good
guys I really like them now that I have
that I'm gonna go on with this a liquid
eye shadow this is josie maran Marin's i
don't want to say that I don't know
coconut water color eyeshadow this is in
the Rio de rose gold color and I'm going
to be putting that on my lids and then
kind of just blending it out with my
finger I like a pretty saturated thing
but sometimes this can like you have to
shake it up because it gets stuck to the
sides especially if it's like cool in
your house or something it can kind of
turn a little bit into solid the pigment
kind of collects but yeah just shaking
it up and then we'll be putting this on
our eyes I love these I really want to
get a couple other shapes because I
think they're super great but I got this
in a kid that's why I happen cuz they're
kind of expensive so I'm just gonna put
that straight from the thing onto my eye
and then I'm just going to kind of blend
it out with my finger and you can always
go in and like build this up two if it's
lost any of its metallic sheen or you
want it a little bit more metallic okay
that's what it looks like what it's all
blended out I really like that and so
I'm just going to do that to the other
eye
and now as you're patting this out make
sure you try to keep it as low in the
lid as possible while still being
blended into the crease a little I know
that sounds really confusing but you
don't want to get the shimmer too high
up in the crease but um ok so that's
that and now we are on to my back hurts
I have to stand up straight for this
angle to work and it's a lot of work and
i'm so lazy so the second start the show
is going to be this palette and this is
actually a blush palette i'm going to be
using this color up here it is called
marsala and um sorry this color appear
which is called marcel and i'm going to
be putting that in the crease again
blowing it out i'm going to keep it
really concentrated and then blow it out
as I go just so we can get a really nice
blended look and if you don't have
something like this you can use any red
brown color you have I mean maybe even
more of like an orange red whatever you
have this is just what i use and what i
like to have in my crease for this look
I've done this like a couple times and
not that I have but this is limited
edition if you don't have it then just
make something you have work and I'm
going to be using a brush like this like
fluffy blending but not too fluffy and
we're going to put that in our crease
and just kind of build it up so
and I'm keeping the most of the product
on that outer corner and then bringing
it into the crease and we're going to go
back and blend so I like that me and Sam
to a lot of fun things this weekend and
one of the things that we did was go
shopping in Beverly Hills not that we
bought that much or anything really but
we did get our mom's a Mother's Day gift
already which I'm super-excited to send
off to them I know they're going to
probably be watching this video so be
prepared I mean I don't want to hype it
up too much but definitely it's gonna be
hard for me and Sam not to get in there
ourselves okay yes I like it I like it
so far this is definitely a very red
warm look you can you know of course
tone it down and maybe put more Browns
in it instead of just the straight-up
marsala color but I like it now that
that's done I'm just going to go in with
that efore Tino product on the brush and
just blend out that outer edge just to
make sure it's as blended as we can get
it okay now that that is blended out we
are going to go in with a matte under I
highlight so any cream color will do i
will be using this color right here from
the steelo's the Stila mind palette
amazing this color and just putting that
right underneath the brow bone and then
again we're going to blend it out to
with that say v40 so just that's what
we're doing I don't want to do a shimmer
highlight one because I just don't
prefer them but two I feel like the look
has a lot going on and again shimmer
would just kind of distract from it
instead of AD and we're blending
so that's that part of the look so far
now we're going to go on to the lower
lash line i will be using you guessed it
this is the Stila oscar fish liner on
the bottom lash line i'm going to be
smudging it out what I do like every day
every look you know so putting this on
there and then we're going to add some
like ready brown colors down there
so I know some people are really
cautious about using Reds really close
to the eye and you should be but I'm
gonna go in with some that same red
color that marsala color from the blush
palette and put that down there I'm
going to be using this brush right here
it's just an angled eyeliner brow brush
but it's quite thick so be using this
brush and adding some product down there
on top of that brown liner okay so
because we added that brown liner I
think this red marsala brownish color
doesn't look to read on the eyes I
really like it and so that's going to be
that i'm going to type line using this
make up for ever aqua eyes pencil in the
color black and i'll be back so that's
the look with a tight line and now i'm
going to go put in some put on I'm gonna
go put on some mascara and I'll be right
back in the mold of the inner corner and
i'll let you guys see the final look for
the last little step for this look I'm
gonna be taking this Elizabeth Mont
shadow stick and i just realized in my
update for cinco de mayo i put a
different liner in there than this one
so I don't know how I got that confused
I don't know what I did this is the one
that I'm actually trying to finish up by
Cinco de Mayo so I am trying to get as
much use out of this as possible even
though it is not my favorite so i'll be
putting this on my inner corner and then
kind of bringing it just a little bit
down the lash line to brighten that
inner corner and just add some more
Sparkle
so this is the final luck guys
they hope you guys enjoyed this video I
know a lot of you were wanting to see it
and this is how I created that look
hopefully it's something I thought this
is a really easy look so I definitely
think it'll be easy for you guys to do
even if you don't really know anything
about makeup and if you do then you got
this covered girl and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
