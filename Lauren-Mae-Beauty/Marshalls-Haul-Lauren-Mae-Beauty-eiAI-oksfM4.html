oh my gosh my voice all crabby um this
is gonna be a marshalls hall I don't
know what it is I've just been wanting
to go to marshalls end by like just look
at their bath and body and makeup and
all that type of stuff and buy stuff and
it's weird because I've gotten so much
free stuff from work that it's like I
really don't need this stuff but
something has compelled me i just
subscribed to holly eats lipstick and i
watched a marshalls hall from her like
from a long time ago and then she just
posted a new one and i don't know it
just got me wanting to go wanting to
shop and i honestly haven't bought
anything in so long I've done so well
and I just finally got the urge to buy I
haven't been wanting necessarily like
makeup items I haven't even been tempted
to go on like safaris website or
anything which is like insane for me
like super crazy which sometimes I go in
these types of like roller coaster
stages but I don't know what it is but
this I just had to do so let me show you
the things i got i went a little crazy I
didn't need any of this stuff like any
of this stuff but i thought i would show
you anyway and let's get into all the
crap i bought at marshalls oh so one of
the first things that I found there this
is the garrison and home body co Los
Angeles hand soap this is in the scent
01 lavender rosemary I like this it's a
glass bottle which I totally love I just
really like the packaging honestly I
didn't need in that hand soap i have
like mmm I don't know maybe 25 hand
soaps from Bath and Body Works but the
size of this was so nice this was 799
compared at $16 and I thought it'd be
great for the kitchen like a good
kitchen hand soap scent and I thought it
would last for forever yeah it's very
herbal i don't know like very calming i
really like this like if you're doing
dishes like calming I don't know and
it's supposed to have um oils and stuff
in it so I thought if you're doing
dishes and stuffs your hair's don't get
dry it out it might be nice mostly the
other packaging it was really just the
baggage thing it's so cute i love that
civic last bottle and like i'd love to
reuse it for something what I don't know
but it's like it's kind of hard to see
this one but this is flower farms why
Rose body wash and this smelt really
nice yeah smells like roses it kind of
smells like the L'Occitane Rose hand
cream and I really liked that product so
this is only 299 compared to six dollars
I don't know I thought it would just be
nice the packaging was so cute on it to
you and I like rose sons and
specifically this Rose scent was nice so
I got that I decided that while i was at
marshalls if I saw any Battiste i would
get quite a bit because it's been really
hard to find here and I got these for
599 a piece which usually they retail
for about like eight dollars or so some
people solve for like 12 it just depends
so I got three of them I've tried these
two before this is the blush sent this
is just a regular one they're not tinted
or anything um I really I like this
scent okay it's better than the fresh
and clean one I don't really like that
smell and then I had never seen this one
the packaging so cute this is in the
sense bright and lively floral essence
so I wanted to give this one a try it
and sprayed in the store or anything so
we'll see how I like that scent but i
just love but easter egg shampoo it's
like my holy grail i absolutely love it
it's best it's the best so I wanted to
stock up while I was there so I could
get it out of good price because that's
what fifteen dollars plus three like 18
to eighteen dollars for three instead of
more than that do math I got another
like shower gel this is the UM what's
their brand philosophy philosophy almond
and cream body wash but you can also use
it as a shampoo and a bubble bath this
melt really nice um I'm not usually an
almond type of person I think almond
smell like cherries and I don't
necessarily like that scent but this was
more like bakery stop smelling I thought
this would be nice for like going into
fall and stuff especially here like a
feel-good sent so this was seven dollars
as opposed to 17 so I thought I would
give it a try and I've never used these
before and everyone seems to really love
them i'm excited to see how fragrant
they are in the bath and i got this this
item was kind of a splurge this is the
oka I think is how you see it we sell
candles like this at work from this
brand as well as the perfumes I've seen
me like the perfumes and stuff at
sephora too but this is a sugar based
body scrub in grapefruit and cucumber
the scent that was Cleopatra I just
wanted to try this I thought oh this is
like a good brand I want to try this
product so I did it's usually $32 but it
was only 16 99 it was kind of a splurge
for a body scrub especially since I
don't need about I don't need it but I
just wanted to try it I just wanted to
have fun and buy things to try whether I
needed them or not and it felt good it
felt fun I haven't done it in so long so
um I'm excited to use this I really like
the packaging it looks really classy and
yeah I think this will be good oh it's
kind of hard to see I'm sorry guys it's
a little washed out this is dr.
bronner's magic soaps this is pure
castile soap my beauty teacher from
school told me that one of the best ways
to wash your brushes as with castile
soap so I've been wanting to buy some
but I just haven't seen any and I do
want to get the mint one because they
have that at costco because it's on face
brushes and i just don't want like meant
to get into someone's eyes what i was
thinking like it might be a little
tingly which some people might like
something like not like especially if it
brings them so i just didn't want to
risk it but i got this and this is in
the lavender scent i thought this would
be really nice and I'm excited to try
this and see how well it like breaks
down all the makeup right now we're
using cream makeup in theater and it's
very thick and it definitely needs
something more than just like a normal
soap to wash it out I need to move to
actually break down that product so that
one I'm not sitting there watching my
brushes for seven years and into that
they're just really clean and all that
like residue is actually out of the
brush so I'm excited to try this off her
recommendation it felt like I bought
more than this I mean this is a lot of
stuff but oh it's cuz I got a lot of
lashes why
I got some lashes and I got things for
my kit at school two of them are the
same yeah I got two of the Betty's
that's what they look like I thought
they looked really pretty really wispy
the band seemed really nice and thin and
they reminded me of the ones that the
school cells they were 299 which I
believe the school sells them for like
either 299 of three so I thought might
as well get these ones the packaging is
really cute it's by the brand um I don't
know the cream shop the creme shop I
don't know but I got Betty ones I got
two of those ones and then i also got
one of Katy so I thought this would be
really nice I think they look really
full and wispy I really like fluffy
lashes not to like like really thick I
like them more like fluffy I got
suckered at the checkout for these these
are by the vintage cosmetic company they
are so cute once a toenail clipper one's
a fingernail clipper the big 12 toenail
the small ones the fingernail and
they're just so cute um they're like a
floral print on them i absolutely love
them they're 299 apiece and I thought I
could have these ones and Sam can use
other ones not that we don't need to
share cuz you know we're husband and
wife and it's fine but I just really
wanted them i just thought they were fun
and I'd rather have these cute ones and
like normal ones so I went for it two
more items I decided to get these hydros
soothing cooling iPads they look like
little like Kiwis and I just really
wanted to try these out they have a year
life like span on them I don't know how
many are in here but you put them on and
they're just most do they already
pre-moistened in this pack there's like
liquid in there and they're like
closable so you can put them in the
fridge or whatever and yeah you just set
them on your I they're supposed to do
puff and help make your eyes look more
refreshed I'm excited to use these
working where I work I feel like I'm
more not self-conscious I'm definitely
coming into myself more in this job it
was definitely a hard transition I
worked for the same company before I
moved here for five years and so
kind of a deal switching to whole new
everything on top of moving to a whole
new state with no family but um I'm a
little bit more concerned about like
puffiness and just the way my skin looks
because that's the industry man i'm in
the beauty industry so i thought these
would be great for times like maybe I
watched I don't know the series finale
of sons of anarchy because when i watch
that I bawled my eyes out and so the
next morning these would have been
perfect to you so that I didn't look
like such a crazy person but that's what
I'm gonna use it for just times like
that where maybe I don't get much sleep
or I really just need to New it's gonna
do puffs and really help call my my eyes
my eyes are really sensitive to anything
like if I cry at ear I will see it the
next day it'll be swollen so um yeah now
that I cry oh haha usually it's just
because I emotionally attached myself to
fall like fictional characters really
that's my life the last item is not a
beauty item but I just thought it was so
cute sorry I'm unwrapping it I got this
mug and it says hello darling and I just
thought it was so cute it was 299 in the
bottom it has like a pair of lips I
don't know I just really liked it I it's
something about it i thought was just so
cute and so I don't know just cute I
really liked it I liked the color just
everything about it was really cute so
that's everything I got at Marshall let
me know if you guys like what your best
finds you've ever found at marshalls are
I really want to get some like skin care
stuff if it's a good enough price and
something I'm really willing to try
there was some 80 there was some
ole henriksen but there's only one and I
didn't want that item specifically so
anyway tell me what your best find was
at marshalls or you know what you like
to buy it marshals in the comments down
below and I will see you in my next
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
