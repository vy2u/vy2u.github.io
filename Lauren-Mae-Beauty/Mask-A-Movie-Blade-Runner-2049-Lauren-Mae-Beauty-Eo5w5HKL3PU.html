Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing a new kind
of series on my channel I don't know how
often I'm gonna do these but I'm gonna
be putting a mask on my face and we're
gonna talk about a movie if you guys
don't know I love movies me and Sam go
to movies all of the time and yeah it's
like a big part of our lives so I
thought it would be fun to kind of
incorporate something like that into my
channel I try to add them into my
favorites videos and I thought this
would just be another fun way to do that
on top of making me do a mask so as you
can tell I'm bare face right now I don't
know what is going on with this you guys
this has been plaguing me now for like I
don't even know at least four or five
days and it's like one of those ones I
just couldn't pop it but I'm a picker
and anyway I thought that this would be
a good time to actually do a mask so
today's mask is going to be the
cosmetics detox activated charcoal mask
this is a more purifying and detoxifying
mask so I thought it'd be perfect for
this because it's disgusting it says
your talks about your skin with magnet
like charcoal why can't it talk do you
toxify your skin with magnet like
charcoal and absorbent clay that draws
out impurities in excess oil and cleanse
away at pollutants from congested pores
for a visibly brighter more radiant
complexion now I have used this before I
just thought I would read that since
it's like you know we're talking about
the mask I do really like it it dries
really nice and kind of feels like this
a velvet latex finish what you guys will
actually get to see which i think is
cool and before I forget I wanted to
mention that this was inspired by
Jacqueline Levine here on YouTube I'll
leave her linked she does a jack chat
type of series but she did one where she
was doing masks and I liked it a lot and
I thought it was a really awesome idea
so that's why I wanted to do this but
the thing I'm realizing is like oh you
have to talk with this thing on my face
the whole time and also be bare face
which I don't know is a little bit like
it's kind of ugly so sorry you're gonna
have to you know watch me talking about
a movie with this thing on my face but
you know that's real light so I'm gonna
apply this the brush
using is just one from Michaels it's the
craft smart 3/4 brush I got business
that had like a bunch of brushes for
five dollars and I really like the way
that masks apply with a brush like I
highly suggest it if you don't have a
brush just go get a little cheap one or
use a foundation paddle brush and clean
it because it just feels like so much
more soothing and relaxing to me and I
just put some out on my hand some kind
of a lot but and we're gonna start
putting this on the movie we're talking
about today is a new one it is Blade
Runner
20:49 is that what it's called it's at
the year it is on the title I think
that's it I was thinking about it and I
think I am going to do spoilers so I'm
sorry um but hopefully if you guys have
already seen it I saw this on Thursday
night like I saw it right when it
released because all of my director
friends really wanted to see it so yeah
we went and saw it in IMAX at like 7:00
p.m. on Thursday I'm just using the
monitor to to put this on so if it's not
perfect that is why I do have some
information on it because I thought it'd
be fun to just talk about I don't know
not like I'm reviewing it I'm not like a
critic I mean okay I love to critique
movies but you know I'm just a little
old me so keep that in mind and I
definitely have certain tastes I guess
you could say oh wow I'm gonna need even
more I don't know if I just put way too
much on this side of my face or what but
we're definitely gonna need more because
we need those pores detoxified on my
nose I'm gonna finish putting this on
then we'll start talking because this is
gonna take forever
alright guys I have the mask on we are
in business we're gonna let this dry
while we talk about the movie so like I
said we're talking about Blade Runner I
don't know if there's going to be
spoilers in this so if you haven't seen
it and you really want to see it and you
don't want spoilers maybe you don't
watch this I'm really sorry but I can't
promise anything ok so just a few little
facts out of the way this was directed
by Dennis it's really hard to say his
last name
I will leave his name down below I'll
leave all this information the cast some
of the like main I'm just gonna say like
the main forage people I don't know I'm
Harrison Ford obviously Ryan Gosling Ana
de Armas and then also Jared Leto's in
it the runtime on this movie is 2 hours
and 44 minutes I mean I wasn't expecting
any less if you've seen the original but
yeah it's a long long movie and then I
thought budget would just be fun to talk
about too the budget for this was a
hundred and fifty million dollars I'm
gonna start off by saying something a
bit controversial about the whole Blade
Runner situation I was not really a fan
of the first one
me and Sam actually watched it pretty
recently and it's just not my thing um
the entire original movie I was so
confused didn't know what the heck was
going on I wouldn't say that I'm like
the biggest fan of like sci-fi type of
movies but the fifth element is one of
my all-time favorite movies ever so I
kind of am like I can get into it but
the original is just very confusing for
me it was super long it felt as long as
it was I I felt like at the end I was
just like what and you know so um going
into this movie the only reason I really
saw it honestly was because some of my
friends wanted to see it and we're like
okay yeah we'll go I'm just gonna say it
I liked this one better than the
original
I know that a lot of people aren't gonna
feel that way because a lot of people
love Blade Runner but this one for me
was just so much easier to follow this
the story if you guys don't know is
about this futuristic society it's set
in Los Angeles and the new one is set in
20 49 and we're following the Ryan
Gosling
who plays agent Kay it's like Kay and
like a long number
since then anyway he hunts down
replicants which are these artificially
made beings who look like humans and are
very similar to humans but he hunts them
down to basically like kill them if you
can say killing about an artificial
being I don't know if you guys can hear
the dog toy but if you can I'm really
sorry but the neighbors have a cute
little dog and I'm guessing it's playing
with toy at the moment so we find Ryan
Gosling hunting down all of these
different replicants and while he's
doing that he finds out that spoiler
alert one of the replicants actually
like birds a baby and that's kind of
like the callus for the rest of the
movie of him like finding out who he is
and you know the humans wanted to stop
anyone from finding that out and also
kill all the replicants who potentially
could have a baby and all the
information on how to do this has been
lost in a big blackout between the first
movie and this movie so there is no
information on how to do that it's kind
of like the humans versus the people
that are making replicant which is Jared
Leto's character they want to find the
the baby the child that was born so they
can figure out how to recreate that and
so that replicants can kind of you know
start populating themselves and can kind
of like have their own spot in the world
and kind of like take over essentially
story wise I'm not saying this is my
favorite story but for dealing with the
whole Blade Runner situation I did enjoy
it
it has Ryan Gosling in it so you know I
already love it plus an Adonis is like
so so beautiful as well so just visually
looking at them the entire
two-and-a-half hours is really nothing
the sound in this movie is just so
insane and so is it it's it's very
similar to the first one but I mean this
soundtrack if you can call it that it
doesn't even quite have like music in
the traditional sense it uses like
motorcycle sounds and like all these
different sounds to create feeling and
since we saw it in IMAX I mean this
sound and there was literally like
shaking the walls it was so cool
visually this movie is super stunning as
well if you look at the poster for this
movie
it has like that kind of like greeny
blue and then that orange II red on
either side it's so pretty and so like
contrasting and that kind of goes
throughout the movies either scenes are
soup or orange or they're super blue I
thought that was really well done and
just if you took still shots of the
different scenes it's just so cool one
of my favorite scenes is when he goes to
I think it's like Wallace Incorporated
or something like that Jared Leto's like
big Factory and he has like an office in
there and there's like water everywhere
but there's like all of this like crazy
orange light like reflecting onto the
wall and it's just such a beautiful like
it just looks so so beautiful it's one
of my favorite like kind of like shot
slash scenes in the whole movie I
thought they did a good job like
harkening back to the first one while
still making this one its own and not
like copying it to too much which I
enjoyed because I didn't really like the
first one so I'm glad it was different
enough for me to get I also like that
this story line was easier to follow I
kind of like knew what was going on
sometimes it was a little too like
in-your-face but compared to the first
one this one was like okay I get it I
think I can follow along with what's
happening and that was enjoyable for me
as a viewer another scene that I really
really liked in this movie or I don't
wanna say that I really liked it but
that was just so interesting and
something I've never seen on screen
before was okay so Ryan Gosling has his
like a girlfriend I guess you could say
but she is like a holograph a hologram
oh my gosh guys seriously I can't I'm
gonna die Sam's not even home I have to
handle the situation on I know how did
that even get in here guys I hope I'm
still in focus I have no idea where that
bug went if you guys saw that or I don't
know if I cut that all out because like
I was scared to death so I might have to
you know go kill that and find it
what is happening this whole um Indiana
mask it's kind of falling apart so I
might have to like leave and go kill a
bug and be an exterminator for like a
second I'm very paranoid at the moment
if you guys you know didn't hear all the
squealing I don't really like bugs okay
so anyway what was I saying oh yeah
there's a scene with Ryan Gosling and he
has like his girlfriend who's a hologram
and she really wants to be like a real
person but obviously she can't because
she's not she's like artificial
intelligence and that's like the big
thing underneath this whole movie which
we'll get to in a second because I need
to hurry because this is basically dry
she asks one of these replicants he's
like kind of like this prostitute and
we've met her like very briefly earlier
in the movie to basically sleep with
Ryan Gosling and she wants to kind of
like be like in her body even though
she's not she just like kind of like
clones over and like follows her
movement so it's like they're together
even though they're not and so there's
like this scene or she gets undressed
and they like kiss and you like see the
hands and sometimes they're in perfect
sync and sometimes they're not where you
can see that it's like the hologram and
the girl and so they like our kissing
and then her hands go behind his head
and you can see like the different like
the hands it's like very it's a very
strange scene and very interesting it's
just something I've never seen done on
camera and it just made me feel I don't
know what it made me feel but it was
just definitely different you know so
yeah that was like another scene that I
I don't wanna say enjoyed cuz it's not
like I don't even know if I enjoyed it
it was just something so different I've
never visually seen then so that was
really interesting to see on-screen
overall what I really liked about this
movie for me is that it really makes me
question as we get you know more
technological in our society and we
start having artificial intelligence you
know when they get to the point in this
movie where they feel like Hume I mean
they're humans it feels like where do we
draw the line when do they start feeling
feelings and emotion
and things like that how are we going to
navigate that future and I think that's
something really interesting and that
this movie shows you a side of these
replicants who you know are artificial
but in the movie they're very much human
I mean they bleed and they have feelings
and they don't obviously want to get
killed and all of these things but they
aren't human they were made
is it slavery is it not is it cruel is
it not I think these are really good
questions to bring up and as much as
this is like sci-fi and you know not
happening on this world it definitely is
a good question because we have a future
that this potentially you know at some
point could happen in at least at some
level so yeah
anyway those are my thoughts on Blade
Runner I don't know how good this review
is gonna be I don't know how this is
gonna go definitely let me know if you
want me to continue doing these I might
even do masks and chats but let me go
take this off or see you like I don't
even know format yeah actually I'm gonna
go take this off and then we'll do the
outro this mask is different from a lot
of other like more clay mess because it
doesn't get dry like if you can't tell
it's not cracking at all like I said it
feels very like almost like a latex like
a thin layer of latex that's like
powdered or something over your face but
anyway I'm gonna go take this up and
I'll be right back so I am back
the mask is off this is a really easy
mask to remove since it doesn't dry down
show like cakey I don't feel like I have
to really scrub to get it off my face it
also doesn't add any extra exfoliating
properties which a lot of other like
clay type of masks do which I enjoy
sometimes my skin can feel almost raw at
that point by the time it's all dry and
so it's nice to just have a nice smooth
not irritated skin it is so so smooth I
put a little moisturizer on an eye cream
just so my skin didn't get tight but
really really happy glad I did it let me
know if you want me to continue doing
this if you like this series you know
I'd like to just do different things on
my channel I like to do things I'm
interested in I hope that this even
makes sense because if you haven't seen
the movie I don't know how good of a
review this is I thought it would just
be fun to kind of talk about and Muse
about a movie that is everything
hope you're having an amazing day guys
and I will see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
