Lauren and I am here with my special
guest star as family called Sam my
husband I have done other videos with
Sam in the past I'm gonna leave a link
down below and today we're doing a mask
in a movie so we're gonna be putting on
a mask and we're going to be doing some
movie reviews we're gonna do more than
one today just because we've seen so
many recently because of movie pass it's
amazing we love it so much
and yeah that's it so let's just get
into the masks right sure
okay this is the mask I picked out for
you I chose to get comedic restore and
moisture cosmetic cosmetics restore
moisture is it's a mask who are you in
block linguistic to get your store and I
hand p.m. very good for if you have
sensitive skin if you have a little bit
of redness or dryness or a little bit of
skin on the body
you should probably I could highly
recommend this great yeah first time
I've ever used to highly recommend I am
sponsored by this I have a tattoo of
them on my back hashtag hashtag hashtag
masks um anyway you start sponsored none
of that's true except these were sent to
me through octal II that's the only
thing that potential mister go anyway so
I picked that mask out for Sam because
he's had really dry skin for the winter
and so I thought that I would I was such
a good beauty guru um I thought that I
would do that one for him for me I chose
this one this is D sand and sky I've
never used this before it's a mud mask
rich with vitamin A vitamin E and seal
saliva and kelp no not true but this is
the G toxified in Brighton so I thought
this would be nice for a winter it came
in a cute little box and something that
was kind of nice but kind of sad is it
came with this nice little brush but
then it broke
we're not going to be able to use that
it's just kind of like a cheapy little
brush it didn't really work out so um
we're going to apply these I'm gonna put
mine on first I try the Benny Hill thing
I have this new elf mask brush - we'll
see how it works this is like such a
thick mass okay let me give you a little
bit of a review right now the mask this
mask came very very thick and I don't
know if that's normal or if it was kind
of like dried out but I'm going back to
just my paint brush all it's easier so
I'm gonna put this all over my face Sam
can you put that on your face kind of
smells like um margarita the orange
stuff you when you have paint on your
hands and you have to scrub it off it's
that orange run kind of what's it called
it's just so thick I feel like it should
be mixed with water I have to use um you
can use the dirty one or just use your
hands you're supposed to massage it into
the skin read the directions to everyone
first lay in your filthy faces if you
want to put a mask on that's always
anyone's stuff I didn't only real beauty
gurus know that step Sammy like it's
just really thick I'm not sure I like
this okay read the direction no to
everyone we can't read your brain learn
to apply a generous amount to dry skin
and massage into skin using circular
motions leave on skin for ten to fifteen
minutes and then rinse off or leave on
and blot away excess product with a soft
tissue
yeah choice we don't care we just make
the product you do it you want some
sensitivity please wear sunscreen when
using this product as it uncontained
ingredients that may increase your
skin's sense
the Sun okay I already have it all over
my face we've done nothing listen good
ears look up this is the worst idea to
fill her that like literally the worst
idea okay my this product does contain
vitamin a great job Sam use the only
thing you did right use with caution if
taking dietary supplements or other
products containing vitamin A okay why
are there warning labels on these I'd be
fine okay anyway it says apply only to
freshly out skin using the applicator
brush provided couldn't do it cuz that's
broken
let the mask dry completely
approximately 10 minutes gently remove
with warm water pat dry using a soft
clean towel the time is on we have to do
your that plain moms like it's taking no
it put more on like amethyst I did I put
a whole bunch for me look at my face
because you never have lotion
yours this pain that's altogether
buttons orange and lotion like this is I
think this is definitely too dry I think
mine is like dried out so that kind of
sucks if this was a better texture it
would have gone on really easy okay are
you done misogyny you look in circular
motions here we go okay great I just
don't want to look like the only psycho
one in this video it look like you're a
lifeguard we're gonna do just like speed
reviews because we have to take this off
pretty fast
so um the first movie we're gonna review
is Lady Bird so if you thought Sam let's
start write it and give a few thoughts
later five out of five stars to the
highest rated movie at Rotten Tomatoes
so guys in two weeks ago highly
recommend seeing it what I love about it
most is that it's like real life where
it's at sometimes and it's funny and
it's both at the same time yeah is that
called poignant it's the mid-surface
it's the Midwest of California's or she
lives and it's yeah Sacramento right
yeah I like how you only have a little
bit of time they're like let me give you
the description of where this takes
place very good
to find some really good letting you
guys live on the secret info alright
next we highly recommend definitely
think you should see it I don't care who
you are you should see it burning really
bad okay just keep it together next
brought to you by house your phones on
Lord filming don't you know this is
professional okay number two Murder on
the Orient Express fell asleep I thought
this one alone assimilate was I did not
like it
I give it a three out of five like I
give it two point five stars out of five
stars
yeah it didn't burn as bad as this mask
but it did I give it a how many like
still give it two point six out of five
star just have to ask me would you put
two point five you didn't remember that
I just said it I give it two point five
I thought that it looked beautiful and
it was very fantastical but I just
wasn't under the impression it was gonna
be like that I thought it was gonna be
more Sherlock Holmes II and like I don't
know I haven't seen the original though
so I think that it is kind of catching
him kind of like that's what it's like
but I wasn't feeling it next we're gonna
talk about three billboards outside of
effing Missouri
brought to you by Martin McDonagh author
of pillow man and director and I think
writer of Seven Psychopaths so I suggest
that one over this one I give this movie
3.5 stars I just for me I love the story
of it I thought the performances were
amazing I just didn't like the tone of
it there were some really weird points
when he's like test boiler when he's
like that's his wife I just the whole
the sheriff what Woody Harrelson and his
wife that whole situation is just weird
to me like first off I would like
totally don't believe the age difference
she was like an accent which whatever
people can be formed
places it was just weird if you've seen
it you know but it was like we're all
sitting there being like a little weird
right
but everyone performances were good yeah
that's the thing but I just I think the
story and the tone kind of yeah I would
be like fusses and I had high
expectations Oh
oh my gosh I look so scary that's the
thing about these videos it's like we do
it and it's like here watching look
hideous or a whole video live yeah
Frances McDorman awesome and I had to
give it 75 out of 100 stars next we're
moving on moving on Coco do it yeah this
is a good Pixar movie if you've come to
expect them to be sad and high-quality
than you'll experience pretty good yeah
you see I heard that they've since
removed we saw there was a frozen short
I don't know if you can call it a short
but that's the whole thing that I hate
about the entire thing is like right now
we're talking about the frozen short
instead of Coco it's like why didn't it
was super long like 25 minutes partying
in front of it I think they pulled it
but anyway it's Coco is really good Coco
is great and fun and enjoyable eyeballed
like the whole time yeah I cried so much
do it say mama Coco Oh
oh my gosh you said mama Coco in this
creepy doll voice all the time now we
won't do it for the camera okay next
let's talk about my friend Dahmer this
one's a little bit more indie I guess I
guess some of those other ones were yeah
it's pretty indeed let's see what
haven't heard of it I guess it's pretty
dark okay so what this is about it's
about Jeffrey Dahmer but before he
killed people it's like his experience
in high school and it's based off a book
to a graphic novel that I go graphic now
went to high school with him wrote and
so then he plays a role and not that you
know his he's a character in this story
in a lot of his respect
I guess yeah it's interesting to see
that side you know he's known for all
these infamous things but to see a
potentially different side maybe how he
became that way or how things in his
life have potentially shaped him and who
he is
person behind the monster yeah for sure
I thought it was really well done and if
you have the chance to see it I think
you would enjoy it potentially if you
like that type of stuff oh wait Lee
doesn't give Koko stars five out of five
stars for Koko uh dawn my friend Dahmer
probably like a four point three out of
five I can't kind of five and Dahmer
four out of five okay next let's do the
disaster artist this is a movie based
off of the movie the room
yeah it's based on a book about of the
making of their okay okay yeah it was a
funny yeah also a good time and an
interesting look at a weird and
interesting real-life character I think
that James Franco does a really good job
yeah and almost a similar story you know
as far as seeing the man behind the
legend I guess or the infamy or whatever
was kind of interesting to get some
backstory to it but none no one knows
his backstory what's the apartment
number yeah and it's silly and fun I
give it a four point I give it four
points three
mm I'll give it a four point four one
more than donor but I feel like they're
kind of listening I think they're both
really good six oh wow 500 hi I'm work
okay
next killing of a sacred deer this one
had Nicole Kidman in it they hide a
Colin Farrell in it and two out of five
oh I give it more than that
I've given a 2.7 I think it was better
than Murder on the Orient Express
because I I think that there's more at
play and I'd love to see an interview
honestly about it - maybe like uncover
some things that I do get from just
watching it without explanation but
overall it just like has this level of
intensity and like I'm gonna leave all
the trailers link down below that's a
good way so you guys can like kind of
have an idea if you haven't heard of any
of these what it's about but it has this
like intensity or like what is it it's
like well if you were upset alert the
other movie you'll probably appreciate
this one because yeah it does hold that
same tone throughout however odd and
peculiar and heavy it might be it was
just a very weird it's a very weird
movie I don't know if I suggest the
certified gentleman I don't even know if
I like it or if I don't watch it or pass
us no more the more time I have away
from it the more I like it yeah you can
pass on it's okay I know you have you
want to be artsy and be cool and a cool
kid you'll go see it but don't you like
the kid and Lady Bird smoking and
reading by the pool at the party you
would enjoy this movie reference - all
right next happy deathday now me and Sam
would install this we I told him I'll go
see it again I'll go see it again
because we didn't see it together and
then we got there and I was like I don't
want to see it again so we saw happy
deathday haven't seen it I know I'm
sorry
and then the antsy girl was like oh
you'll love it you're gonna love it she
said you're gonna love it it's better
than it she thought it was better than
it yeah love this this movie I give it a
2 out of 5 it's if you really like
horror movies you might like it
I was fine it was a popcorn movie I feel
like yeah I feel like even same candy
movies like you might enjoy it for two
seconds but you will get cancer also I
want to say right now just as a
disclaimer I love like the things just
because I might not enjoy the movie I
don't
the hard work and time and all these
things that go into it I'm not trying to
like be hateful trust me if I was if I
worked on any of these movies I would be
like go see it it's the best and I think
there's that so I don't want it to be
like you know just cuz I didn't enjoy
the movie and maybe I'm making a you
know hyperbolic statement and to be
funny or or whatever doesn't mean that I
discount the work and time and energy
and all these things that go into movies
how real anyway yeah this is fun it's a
fun that all 2 point 5 out of 5 star pop
oh two point you give it half like
that's what I gave murderer I'm gonna
wear in to express what anyway let's see
next Oh last one and I think we
disclaimer and glad I said that because
next is bad mom's Xmas Christmas
excesses I think would be better for it
I did not see the original bad mom so I
don't know I know a lot of people really
like that movie and I'm kind of
interested to see it to see the
differences or see what worked well and
what they took into this one it just
felt like a bunch of vignettes strung
together in the form of a movie which
was like sketches sketches got a scratch
and I got a sketch yeah just tons of
vulgar sketches and they're like this
will be funny though because it's a
little kids or cuz it's women doing it
about the penises instead of the
opposite way it's usually men or like
flipping the script which sometimes
can't be funny one time but it's like
there's played out so long and it's
definitely not my type of movie I think
you know like this tired or something or
just I don't know I just
it felt forced it felt like these jokes
are written to put into sketches I would
say 0.8 out of 500 I won't give it one
star it was about Christmas and I love
Christmas but then it's also like they
 on Christmas and I love Christmas
that's all the movies I hope you enjoyed
our reviews I'm not even sure how this
video is going to end it out or how it's
gonna be no no no we have to go take it
off first we're gonna go take off our
masks just okay
help me guys help me I'm gonna go take
off my mask Sam's gonna take off his
mask we're gonna come back and give you
reviews and tell you what our faces feel
like and we're gonna close this video up
yeah all right you like that formatting
I'm glad you do Wow
special guest star thank you thank you
all right we'll be back we'll be back
right all right we're back we have our
faces wash so let's give a review can
you ever like try to give an of your
experience with this product I put on
the product
step1 step2 and dry it out and burn but
then step three when I washed it off it
became moisturizing again and so that
was nice because I thought it was just
like gonna be it's not my face yeah but
turns out it gets reconstituted when you
add water back into and it kind of makes
your face a little moisturize how does
your skin feel well I put a little
lotion on it oh yeah I thought I would
tell you guys what we used he used this
one this is the olay regenerist
micro-sculpting cream because it has SPF
in it
oh sorry it has SPF in it and then we
both use this eye cream this is the
Saturday skin eye brightening eye cream
it's the wide-awake one shall we use
that on the under eye and then I used a
different moisturizer I use the elf
daily hydration because I am trying to
test this out I got it from ELF recently
and it's just a really lightweight
moisturizer anyway sorry to bust in
tears okay don't know how frequently you
want to use this you guys don't like
again if you like masks okay watch
movies good Matt all right I'll give my
review so I feel like um boy no you're
so weird that's like the weirdest what
you could review it you're such a freak
I think the packaging and all of that is
really great for this product I do think
that this did some detoxifying and
brightening cuz I mean more than
anything it just kind of burns mine also
burns a little bit
but I wasn't complaining about it the
entire time it wasn't that bad it's kind
of like the glam glow one so I wasn't
like shocked that it was kind of burning
I have a few issues I feel like this
product's pretty tiny I'm gonna put the
prices of these products on the screen I
think both of these are kind of
expensive and I didn't like that this
came kind of dried out like I really do
think mine is more dried out I think
it's usually a bit easier to use so I
felt like I had to use a lot of product
and then I didn't like that the little
brush came broke and that kind of sucked
you know like I probably wouldn't have
used it but I maybe what Evan it's kind
of nice for traveling and you know I
just if you're gonna add the extra thing
it'd be nice if it wasn't broken and I
just probably got unlucky and got a
broken one but it wasn't hard to get off
which I enjoyed sometimes my mask can be
like you've just scrub out your face to
get it off and I was glad that I could
just easily get it off my face feels
super super soft and smooth it's just a
little red and I can definitely feel the
aftershocks of that burning especially
through my cheeks here probably the most
so which is not uncommon I've had that
before so I will update you these are
just kind of like first impressions it's
Sam's first impression guys the squeaky
wheel gets the grease so if someone's
trying to shame you about speaking up if
something hurts don't feel ashamed just
speak up when you need to and you'll get
medical attention
help us I'm gonna end the video I'm
gonna I'm gonna call it I thought this
would be really fun but I'm not sure if
that was a smart idea at the end here
shut up
you can't handle it shut up you're never
seeing invited back to session that is
everything thank you so much for
watching guys I don't know when this
video is gonna go up this morning was
