Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be an empties video if
you're like interested in this video but
I have collected so much stuff this is
kind of a big one I feel like especially
for how recently I've done an empties
I've just been really in the mood to
like finish the products off I also have
a few things from my kit and supplies
from that that has been finishing off so
I'm just going to get straight into it
we're going to do makeup first and I
actually have quite a few makeup empties
which is really exciting
finishing makeup honestly is like the
best feeling I have two powders that I
finished up this one here is the black
opal pressed powder it's a translucent
powder but it can be used on all skin
types I use this in my kit for my likes
on set powder it's just easier to carry
a pressed powder with you when you need
to do touch-ups especially if it's like
on the go then obviously a translucent
like loose powder so I really like this
I repurchase it a couple times I will
continue to repurchase it it's really
good
the other powder that he used up is the
Rimmel stay matte seamless home well
seem just at home but I'm going to keep
filming so if you hear stuff he's in the
kitchen side the other partner was the
Rimmel stay matte I use this up but I
also cracked it put the scoop away I use
this up but I also did crack it at the
beginning since one of the products fell
out originally but I'm still going to
count this as finished because I
repressed it and did my best to use it
up so so this is all gone something
every purchased many many times I think
it's okay I think it's good for the
price so my favorite powder anymore but
I think it stinks I have another one too
in my drawer for whatever reason so I
have to use that it I have to eyebrow
pencils I don't know if I mentioned the
elf pencil on the last one I go through
these all the time this is the color
taupe it's only two dollars I have like
three backups that use these in my kit
even because I like them that much I try
to only use high-end stuff or more
expensive stuff in my case since I do
try to premium rate sludge if I really
do like something and I use it on myself
and it's something that I truly like I
will use it in my kit and this is one of
those products I have two products that
I'm actually getting rid of conveyer
expired this is a steal of stick
foundation it's like a CC cream I know
it looks nasty but this SPF in it has
expired
so it's just time to get rid of it I
really did like that product I think it
was really good I don't know why they
discontinued it but they did you can't
get any more and it's expired and I
don't recommend buying any of you see em
cuz they're probably all expired at this
point the other product that's also
expired is being nearad invisible
perfecting shield kind of sad about this
one it expired at in January of this
year I just wasn't even aware of it I
actually tried to use this recently and
it just was really a weird texture on
the skin and I've used up one of these
little samples before so I knew
something was up
I checked the date and of course it was
gone so kind of sad that I waited too
long to use that because I could have
actually done good use out of it and
what I have some beauty blenders in here
I changed out some of the beauty
blenders that I had in my kit because it
was just time I decided to wash them and
show you guys what they look like on the
inside and it's not gross I was just so
interested myself in seeing what the
beauty blenders would look like on the
inside and I thought for sure there
might be Foundation and I thought was
the case I might question if I should
use Beauty blenders in my kids but there
is no foundation I feel like if you are
using the proper cleanser and you are
cleaning means when you should be they
work I feel totally fine using these in
my kit and I love the way that they
apply foundation on the skin we are
moving on to the big bucket next to me I
feel like there's just so much stuff in
here I'm going to move on to perfumes
actually as to perfumes that I've used
up the first one here is one of my
favorites ever this is a molecule or
eccentric molecule the one I love the
smell of it it smells so good
I will be repurchasing this this is
something I would want in my collection
all the time always it's amazing I get
so many compliments on a scent Samuel I
like this scent it's a unisex scent it's
so good it's expensive but I feel like
it's 100% worth it I cannot wait to
repurchase this the next one is the
Bulgari and this is the omnia coral
scent I do really like this scent as
well it really works with my body
chemistry I also get a ton of
compliments when I wear this I don't
like it as much as I used to
I'm not saying I don't like it now I
still do but it should not like I'm not
obsessive it like I used to
I'm like really chill down this video
Leyna bag my packs like hurting I don't
want to sit up guys I don't want to do
it let me try to sit up and not slouch
but no promises
anyway I do really like this I think see
myself for purchasing it I found it for
a really good price it is really nice I
do really like it it just brought in
like my all-time favorite ever like oh
I'm like crazy about it you know I have
a couple like hand sanitizer type of
thing this is the perfect beach day hand
soap for massive body works this smells
okay it wasn't anything amazing it
wasn't anything bad I liked their hand
soap the next one here this is a hand
sanitizer from assured I just got this
at the dollar store and this is the hand
sanitizer I like to use in my kit you
know as makeup artist you always want to
be washing your hands I feel like I'm
constantly using hand sanitizer to make
sure my hands are clean right before
touch anyone's faces and I really like
to wait this one feels it doesn't leave
any type of residue but I don't feel
dried out wears a lot of them that say
to have aloe and all the other stuff I
just I feel like I wasn't too crap on my
hands and I don't like it so this one's
my favorite and I will continue to
repurchase it I have a big old brush
cleaner in here this is the Bourbon
industry's brush cleaner it get does
that name ease it's fast drying it works
really well I like it a lot every
purchase it now three times it so this
is my second bottle and I already
repurchased it I do like the 10 of the
secrets but this is only $24 for the big
one so it's worth it to me I love you
hair care products this is the batiste
tropical scent in the dry shampoo I love
good this is my favorite scent I
recently went to Marshall and they had
this same sentiment in like unmasked
sizes like literally double the size of
this so I did purchase that and I really
am excited for it but I really like the
tropical I think that's the one I'm
going to continue to purchase I have a
caviar daily densifying so I just got
this from a friend like it wasn't all
the way full and me and Sam used it up
it was nice I don't think I drew
purchases but I didn't hate it this is a
dry texture spray from kenra I enjoyed
this as in it like worked but the smell
was gross Sam really hated the smell so
I wouldn't repurchase that I realized
the Moroccan oil it's probably my
favorite one and also the unite
texturizer spray that was really good as
well and the last year product this is
the puff me volumizing cloud mist I love
this stuff Sam uses this as well we use
it to give texture to the
hair I like on Shorthair that it gives
texture and holes without being
crunching it's still like a fluffy look
it's really great I bought a six pack of
these when I was at Cosmo Prof when I
was in Arizona so yeah I love it I have
a few skincare items this is be simple
micellar water I usually use the Garnier
one instead as a simple but Costco had
an amazing deal on this I originally
bought a set for $12 it had this size
the 6.7 fluid ounces and a travel size
all-in-one but I went to Costco
yesterday and this is what it looks like
you can get this size for six dollars
and ninety seven cents for all three of
those is it an insane deal for the six
point seven so we have that retails at
Ulta for like 647 so I've sucked up and
like four of those so I will be using up
the simple one for a while now I'm
hoping it'll last me throughout the rest
of the year I use this in my kit I use
it on myself to take off my makeup and
my eye makeup every single night I
really like micellar waters because they
just feel I feel clean without the
residue I have an eye pin here this is
from the brand it's good erm and this I
got from optilead I used this all up and
I really did enjoy this I think this
retails for $25 which is an amazing
price you get half a fluid ounce this is
a thicker cream it feels almost like a
lot of those hyaluronic acid type of
like gel cream hybrid I did really enjoy
it I thought it worked really nicely
it's a great one for a night time I
potentially would repurchase this
packaging wise this kept following out
so I didn't like that and it's just like
really bulky packaging I prefer just
like a squeeze tube but product wise I
did think it was really good and I
really liked the price of it I have some
wipes these are both from the brand fel
I have the green tea ones and the aloe
the L is my favorite if I get these at
Big Lots for a dollar for 30 or $2 for
60 I highly recommend either the green
tea or the aloe instead of the other
ones if you're going to get them just
get these with us another skincare
product this is the nukes nukes once a
cloth and this is a daytime moisturizer
I want to say this is like the second
one I've gone through now I just found
through the detox one the night one as
well I got that from work and this one I
got from octiline I really enjoyed this
I was using a day and night
and they were just because I've had it a
while and didn't want it to go bad
because it is more like a natural brand
this just gave my skin a really nice
radiance it moisturized about being too
heavy I definitely think it's a great
day moisturizer if this somehow came my
way again I would not complain I did
enjoy it I thought it was really good
it's a little it's pretty crazy things
like $75 so that's kind of like the
drawback to me but it didn't work and it
was nice answer the shower gel this is
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works in the scent
Rhone honeysuckle amore this is one of
the last ones I have in the old Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works packaging I think I might
have a couple more but I'm really trying
to work through those ones because
they're obviously pretty old they've had
the new packaging for a while now and
I'm really happy to just use up yet
another one of these I feel like I can
usually go through those about one a
month and I really do like the Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works sense I think they just have
nice products and my skin likes them so
okay I got some like plastic or wrapping
type of stuff this is like a sponge pack
I got this from the dollar store there's
the wonderful edges they sucked
I would never refer to them again if
they're afraid I won't want them then I
have some cotton rounds now these are
the slippers ones these ones I bought at
Costco and they're great these are not
like this whispers I've gotten in the
past where they're not in it like in a
capsulated thing these are great I love
them I will continue to repurchase them
from Costco whenever I'm running out
they came like a nine pack for $12 so
it's pretty good it's not a dollar piece
for the spray because this is something
I got a big loss there the premium
cleansing pad these are okay if you're
like you don't want to buy and invest
twelve of your dollars into cotton
rounds and you only want to spend a
dollar twenty this was nice but I just
used cotton around so much for myself I
used like quite a few a night on me and
I also use them in my kit so it's
important to have a lot of them so yeah
I wondered purchase those if I was like
being diligent and keeping up on this
whispers one those are my favorite I
have a toothpaste here this is the crest
extra whitening scope I don't like this
as much as the Colgate one
it's like whitening so I wish we didn't
buy that but we did and we have quite a
few to go through so once we finish this
I will be going back to the other one I
have an eye cream here this is your real
is still and it's the micro eye contour
cream I really enjoyed this and since a
very spin formula
nice moisture without feeling heavy it's
a great daytime eye cream I would not
repurchase this again but I do think
it's a little bit more expensive that
you're looking for an inexpensive eye
cream that's maybe not going to do a
million things for you but at least
we'll give you some hydration I
definitely suggest like the Bioderma one
they have a really nice one I just
bought that for my kit I also like the
and really say one that was like 35
which if you get an item for under $50
it's pretty good so anyway it was nice
but I probably would repurchase I
haven't many of an eye cream I was using
this in my kit until again I got a new
one this is the Clinique pep start eye
cream this kind of helped with like
speed puffing and stuff and it was nice
again it just gives nice moisture I
really like using an eye cream to just
make sure my makeup application looks
the best it possibly can to mark things
this is a Wallflower so this one was
ocean driftwood or no I think it's
mahogany teak wood and then right now I
have in the nectarine green cheese it's
okay it's not my favorite I prefer the
manly scent and last I have a dealer in
here this is the dub clinical protection
and I'd really been liking this I bought
two more because they were had a deal
going on I really do think this helps
keep the stink away which is important
the natural deodorants just don't do it
for me I wish they did but they don't
and if I'm going to be working on
someone and my arms like up it can't be
like stinky girl can't do it okay guys
that is everything I hope you enjoyed
this empties video I think next month is
also going to be pretty big so I'm
excited about that I'm excited to be
moving things out just keeping my
collection fresh with like newer
products instead of really really old
one so I'm really trying to work on that
ok that's everything guys thank you so
much for watching I will see you in my
next video Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
