video for the month of may as well I
feel like I just filmed it empties video
but I have a few things here and then I
can just kind of start over for this
month so let's just get into it i'm
going to do makeup first the first thing
is a foundation this is from number
seven and this is the beautifully matte
foundation i have the color cool vanilla
which i believe is the lightest and i
love this foundation this has been one
of my absolute favorite matt full
coverage foundations for years I
definitely want to repurchase this I
wish the color was a little bit lighter
and not too cool tone just because I am
pretty fair and I do feel like I have to
mix this to get like my actual perfect
shape I have repurchased I think this is
my third tube and I would repurchase
again I really like this I finished up
an eyeliner this is from mary kay it's
the bronze eyeliner and it's gone
there's nothing in there it actually the
tiniest piece i'm talking like this much
actually fell out onto the floor and it
wasn't even like something i could
salvage so this is done i use this a lot
of this year and i'm really glad it's
gone it was kind of dry and I wouldn't
repurchase this the color was nice if
you like Mary Kay but I do not have
enough love for it to want to repurchase
it out of other things or trying other
things another makeup item this is the
bare minerals mineral veil I took out
whatever I could to try to get as much
out of here as possible but that I
really wish I could just pop that out
but there's no way to pop this part out
this is like an uber packaging but I did
enjoy this enough to like get through it
i wouldn't repurchase it though i don't
think it's a must-have I like the
foundation better than this but they're
obviously not comparable in a lot of
ways but i did move this out of my
collection and my last makeup empty this
is a brow pencil from maybelline this is
the definer brow in dark blonde i really
like these pencils and now that they're
both gone already which i bought these
at the end of februari how am I ready
done with them I definitely would
repurchase these especially because
they're pretty dang cheap and they do
have a nice fine point and I miss having
my eyebrows done with these I didn't
know k job today but it's difficult
without these I do really like these i
suggest them I like the color of them
too they're not too warm I just like
these will get the face white
out of the way these are the face wipes
that I use all the time now this is the
Appel at the mo wipes there from big
lots they are one dollar piece you get
30 wipes in them I use these on my face
to take off my makeup before technically
you would go in and use a face cleanser
but if I'm being honest with you most
nights I do not like actually wash wash
my face and I know that's bad and i know
i should but that's just real life so
that's what i use these on my face i use
these to take out swatches i use these
in my kit to just have makeup wipes if
other people want to take off their
makeup that's why i've gone through so
many of these i had like a couple of
them open in different areas and whatnot
but i absolutely love these you cannot
beat the price I just went to fig Watson
I bought just like the pack that they
put out on the thing cuz I'm obsessed
and I just like having them on hand and
i love that i don't have to be like oh I
don't use a wipe like no I need to use a
wipe and actually take my swatches off
or whatever the case may be so I'm in
love with these thank you thank you so
much to Jenna glitter for telling me
about these I have a Battiste in here
Batista's my favorite dry shampoo I will
repurchase always I actually don't have
any more right now so as you can tell my
hair is needing it even with that other
dry shampoo i bought in the full-size
i'm telling you this is just the best
one this is number one always my ride or
die i did finish up this small jawara i
don't know how you say it it's jay you
ara this is the candle at body cream
this is amazing this smells so good its
kind of coconutty but it's not it's not
coconut it's some different tropical
type of smell I love this I want to buy
the two fragrance oils that they have I
really want to buy both of those they
smell so good mixed together so alone
the scent of this is just like has my
heart but this body cream feels so silky
on the skin and it feels moisturizing
without being greasy but it also doesn't
feel like when you rub it in and then
like you go like this it's like kind of
tight I don't know some things are like
that this is absolutely beautiful if I
ever use up all my body lotions and body
creams this is one that I would actually
consider having on hand and using
because I like it that much and just
having just this one it smells so good
it's so good so if you I don't know if
sephora carries this brand but if you're
in there and you see it smell this it
just also feels so good i wanna throw it
at you guys but it smells really really
still rolling oh my god I have to hand
soaps this month but if you can tell one
is different this one here is from
kroger so i bought it out my rouse pika
buy it at frys or kroger stores i
believe they have four different sense
that i saw and i bought all four of them
because i'm running low on hand soap i
only have I think three more Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works left and they're my all-time
favorite sons so I'm not like in a hurry
to use them up I kind of want to use
them when I really want to use them so
anyway I got the guava lime right now
i'm using like jasmine teakwood there's
two other sounds like a lemon one and a
mango one they were two for three
dollars 150 for this bottle I felt like
we went through this slower then we do
the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works hand soaps which I
appreciate because as much as I love
hand soaps and having fun ones and good
smelling ones I also don't want to be
purchasing like to a month or whatever
the color of this was like this nice
green blue I thought the packaging was
really cute I just thought they stepped
it up i love the pump and I I just
really liked this so I definitely think
I'm gonna be repurchasing this scent for
sure but these soaps from now on and
then only going to bath and body works
for like really specific since I really
really love but not every single hand
soap I ever buy and that's kind of crazy
for me because I'm like I really like
the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works hand soaps i love
how they feel on the hands i love when
they had the little beads in them to
scrub so anyway i love this so and i'm
definitely gonna repurchase this sent
you one from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works that I
used up was the foaming hand soap in
caribbean escape I don't really like
this scent and I just bought it to like
do a deal and that's what I'm talking
about like I don't want to have filler
sense like this in my house I don't know
I just I'm not that big of a fan of this
it smells okay but it's not like the
best smell another bath and body works
item this is the wild peach papi shower
gel I finished this up and I'm almost
done with another one I'm trying to
really move through some of these
because as you can tell this is like old
packaging I think they've changed the
packaging like once and then changed it
again since this packaging so I got a
lot of these from the semi annual sales
and they still sell stuff in this
packaging during those times but
personally I just want to update my
collection more and I just don't want to
have just such a huge back stock this is
a face scrub it's all beat up because we
get every last drop out this is the st.
Ives blemish control apricot scrub me
and Sam really like
this has like I think pieces of walnut
shell it really is a really nice scrub
if you like a pretty intense scrub you
definitely like this I did not
repurchase this one but I have in the
past instead I got the green tea one and
it is like definitely finer particles
I'm still determining if I like that one
better or if I like this one better I'm
just used to this one and sams used to
it too I'm like asking him what he
thinks I think that I'll probably
repurchase this one next time but I love
this for the price I think it's really
good this is something I got a
generation beauty this is the e salon
tinted love color enhancing treatment
you were supposed to like put this in
with your shampoo oh I just put it in
I'm in my hands and put it in my hair
because I wanted the most color
pigmentation I didn't really like this
for the times when my hair was fading I
could kind of like keep a little more
tint in it than if I had to put this in
I would not go out and like repurchase
this I don't believe because they don't
have a bunch of like fun colors they
only have like natural colors except for
this purple and I like my hair to be
pink so I would repurchase it but I'm
glad I used it up and I do think it
works really nice for keeping your hair
more vibrant I definitely think it would
work for that because it worked for me
like if I use this in my hair straight
like I was it would definitely like dye
my hair I have three hand creams this is
like an ultra mini this is from
malicious and this is the sugar reef
weightless hand cream this did not smell
good to me and ice melt the sugar reef
before in the sugar scrub and I like
that smell so I don't know why this was
just smell a little it wasn't off it
just didn't smell good to me so I would
repurchase this scent but I do think
this is a good hand cream I really like
the coconut scent from them this is the
code early hand cream and this is I
don't know what scent I'll have it
listed down below I love code alize hand
and nail cream they have my absolute
favorite just their regular hand and
nail cream is my favorite scent and just
texture really like that hand cream and
this was no different it just was a
different scent so I still prefer the
original sent over this and even Sam
likes that because sometimes I'll be
like oh here's a hand cream you said you
just have like a coda liwan and snow
that one so I do think it's a really
good formula and this hand cream is one
Sam used up because i did not like it
this is the skin fix hand repair cream
and it's i think just the regular one I
don't
like the intense I do not like the way
this feels it is too heavy and sticky
and nasty and groves and I don't like it
Sam gets really dry hands and I mean he
did it and he said it was fine I don't
think he'd like repurchase it or want me
to go get it for him but I'm not a fan
of this I will only be holding this up
for a brief moment that is a pumice
stone that you just saw and I've had
this since before we moved to California
which is disgusting and it's been a long
time but I got my money's worth out of
this thing i just purchased a new and i
don't like it as much it's from the
dollar store and this one I think is
from like a Sally's I definitely would
repurchase this one again but yeah yeah
I really like that and I really need
pumice stones for my nasty feet this is
a shampoo and conditioner set and it's
just the mini sizes this is the bumble
and bumble full potential shampoo and
conditioner Sam use this this is
supposed to be a like kind of hair
growth system so it's supposed to keep
your hair and help promote hair growth
as well these smell just like the little
booster sprays that I've been using in
different project pans it's a very manly
scent I definitely feel like this is a
range that's targeted toward men because
men usually have horn like you know hair
loss you guys know how I feel about hair
loss stuff I think that they're good and
if you're not having adverse reactions
and you are losing hair you're scared
you're going to I think you should use
one but you're not necessarily going to
see a ton of results necessarily because
you don't know how much hair you would
have lost plus I feel like if you're not
using it with like a serum and making it
like a crazy system you probably aren't
going to see amazing results like new
growth we have a little toothpaste here
this is the Colgate baking soda and
peroxide whitening toothpaste we have a
different one now it was ok it's not a
big deal this is an eye cream I'm really
happy about this this is from origins
and it's the ginseng eye cream I've
moved on to the other one I have but it
is all the way cleared out I do really
enjoy this eye cream but I think I need
something more moisturizing I just feel
like I can tell that this area is just
drier than normal and just starting to
wrinkle and just getting old haha no I
just I don't know I'm just noticing more
that I just need more moisture under
there so as much as I like this I
probably would do something more
moisturizing although this is a daytime
one I don't know maybe if I just did a
nighttime moisturizing one maybe that
would help it's good though I do
think it's nice and the full size is
pretty dang big this is another glam
glow sample pack I do like this ease as
a spot treatment you guys know it's
quite expensive i'm not sure if i'm
going to repurchase p full size but i
have had the full times in the past i
have some cotton rounds from the dollar
store these are the brand i don't know
just cotton sound body I don't like
these these aren't encapsulated so
little fibers go everywhere you're
trading I can't even use them on set
because then they get everywhere and I'm
like constantly trying to like pick them
off someone's face which it's like yeah
they're gonna have a close-up prison
they like that doesn't work out and last
my best friend this is ninety-one
percent isopropyl alcohol I use this in
my kit and I had some uncommon um but I
use ninety-one percent alcohol because
it's higher grade it dries faster but i
also have alcohol pallets in my kit
which are activated by alcohol and you
have to have a minimum of ninety-one
percent preferably ninety-nine percent
alcohol to activate those and use them
so i just like to use the ninety
one-percent because it does both it
sanitizes and does what i need that way
but it also activates the pallet so i
just prefer 91% because i don't know the
higher precise the cleaner right I like
that and it gets go away faster I really
like this this is like a makeup artist
best friends okay guys that's everything
I hope you're having a wonderful day and
enjoyed this empties video yeah I wasn't
planning on filming today but it was
nice to just get a couple videos knocked
out in this fun makeup that I were to
Phoenix though anyway I hope that you're
having a wonderful day i'll stop
rambling and i'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
