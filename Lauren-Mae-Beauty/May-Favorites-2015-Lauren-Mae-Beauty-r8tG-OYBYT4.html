I am going to be doing a very kind of
late may favorites I didn't have a ton
of favorites for me my voice sound crazy
right now Wow I don't know if I'm
getting sick or what that's about mm I
haven't spoken at all today until this
video but anyway i'm doing a may
favorites I don't have a ton of products
makeup-wise to show you guys but it's
don't wanted to do this video to show
you what i have been loving it's been a
little different this is the first month
that I've had like my job basically the
whole month and so my makeup routine and
just my whole routine my life routine is
just totally different than it was two
months ago so I'm still kind of
adjusting to that and you know deciding
what products i'm going to be using when
i get ready in the morning like I
haven't filmed a biweekly make a basket
because I honestly haven't been changing
my makeup up at all so hopefully I'm
gonna try to you know switch stuff up
now that it's been about a month just
because I'm getting a little bored but
anyway i ramble so much let's get into
the products I've been loving and then I
do have a couple like random favourites
at the end so let's do this the first
thing I have to show you guys this is
Battiste now I did just get this from my
marshals hall and I love Battiste
there's no denying that and you probably
already know that if you watch them my
videos but it's specifically this scent
this is my favorite scent that I've ever
smelled from Battiste this one is the
bright and lively floral essences and it
just smells so so nice and yeah I wish I
bought a couple more of this sex
specifically instead of my other one
which is like the blush one but I really
like this scent if you see this I got it
again at marshalls definitely pick it up
or try to smell it or something because
this scent is so good i really like it i
have for makeup products and seriously
that's all the products they have left
to show you so this is a highlighter by
bare minerals this is called the love
affair now I did get this at Christmas
time or at their outlet to so that's
what it looks like I was going to get
rid of this in one of my to clutter
videos and so glad I didn't this
highlighter is just so pretty it's kind
of subtle looking I don't know if you
can see it there on my hand it's kind of
subtle
and usually I like more of a lighter
highlight than this but I've really been
enjoying this on the skin I really like
the way it looks down the bridge of the
nose it almost has like a golden bronzer
you type of color but it's still a
little pink toned to it and I just
really like the color on my skin it
looks more natural I feel like it's
perfect for summer so I will definitely
continue using this I'm just glad that
I'm actually getting use out of it and
enjoying it instead of be getting rid of
it so I've really been loving that
highlighter it's like the only thing
i've been using I haven't been switching
it up at all so and then last all these
makeup products are all I shadows that I
have left and I just have really been
liking a one shadow basically type of
look that's what I've been enjoying this
one here I've worn a couple times this
is all I guess I'll show you it's from
this Maybelline quad this is all of
martini and it is the duochrome shade
right here that's what I have all over
the lid and then I have blended that out
with just some like bronzer yeah that's
all over the lid really nothing else
just super simple I do have more time to
get ready so it's a little more glion
than normal but I mean you really could
even just blend that color out into the
crease and it would look so good I've
really been loving this quad I also have
the blue shade that's down here it's
like a light blue on the inner corners
and I really like the way that looks to
it kind of gives it a pop of color
something interesting but it's still
very neutral you don't want to feel like
oh my gosh you have blue eyeshadow on my
face another bare minerals product and i
know i have so many of those is this one
here this is silk rose this was in my
makeup basket video which i'll link down
below and i really just enjoy using this
all over the eye it isn't very pigmented
I'm sorry I'm opening it it's not super
pigmented it just that's it there I just
really like these like ready tones or
tones that are going to bring out my
eyes I feel like they make my eyes look
really intense without doing really any
work and it gives me the definition I
need but it's just super fast look
usually I'm the type of person that'll
go with just like only a light shade on
the lid and maybe something really like
you know faint in the crease but going
with these darker shades I find that I
look more put together um my eyes look
more defined but I'd still did the same
amount of work as the other
with the lighter shade if that makes
sense and then the last one I have here
this is a two-faced like duo with also a
bronzer in it again these were all in my
makeup basket because this is all I've
been using and this shade here which i
believe is silk teddy yeah silk teddy I
just absolutely been loving I don't know
why I haven't used this before it's very
similar to me to sin from urban decay
but this one is just a little more
golden tones it's just so pigmented and
bright I know you can barely see it so I
apologize but I just absolutely love
that shade I've been using that when I
do want to do like a lighter shade all
over the lid just that and then
something small on the crease usually
though if I do that I'll do like a dark
liquid eyeliner just to kind of ground
to look a little bit more but those are
all makeup products they've been loving
honestly I've been being very basic
there hasn't been anything new I haven't
been buying any makeup I had that
Marshall tall but really there was no
makeup in there it's just like bath and
body and that type of stuff those are
all product wise I'm just not gonna fake
products or tell you something about
like tell you out something that I just
kind of liked I'm not going to do that
so yeah now I'm to kind of random
favourites we did finish white no no
first first favorite I had a thousand
subscribers this month which is
absolutely amazing I've only been
posting videos for three months now and
it's just so absolutely amazing to see
so much support from you guys I just
didn't blown away by that so thank you
so much to each and every one of you I
really appreciate it it's just an
amazing feeling especially because i
wanted to do youtube for so long before
it actually uploaded a video and i just
can't believe how much fun and how far
I've gone in just the short time I have
so again just thanks to each and every
one of you I really appreciate it beyond
what you could imagine that is like
absolutely number one I also getting
into shows me and Sam are show people we
finished sons of anarchy because the
last season is on netflix now so i think
they have the whole show on there now
and I really enjoyed that show it's not
for everyone it's very hmm it's kind of
intense and dig also his gory and
just a heavy show but I really liked it
and I'm glad that not glad that it's
over but I'm glad I finished it there's
something like that so you feel so
accomplished when you finish the show so
I'm glad that we got to finish that out
and know the ending and everything again
I really just I really like the show
what else we're watching this like
Borneo oh I don't know what it's called
I can't even remember so I guess I
shouldn't mention it but it's like on
netflix it's like a nature show but
instead of them just filming nature
they're kind of like filming themselves
it's almost like a behind the scenes of
people who film nature shows so it's
filming the people and what they're
doing and their thoughts and like just
kind of their overall time while they're
filming for these nature shows it was
really just a fun show to watch has like
five episodes and me and Sam are geeks
and like that type of stuff so we
enjoyed watching that we just finished
it last night two more things I guess
one of my friends came into town she
just left yesterday so some of the stuff
is getting into June but I don't care um
and she just came into town and it was
just such a good time it was nice to
kind of get away from work since I work
every single day or have school every
single day it was nice to have one
Saturday off why got to just have fun we
went to santa monica pier and beach and
just enjoy ourselves it was just a great
time so i really enjoyed having that
time with her and just that time to
relax and renew and refresh and then
last me and Sam are going to be going to
Peru he put in for a job through his
company to go to Peru and do work so he
will be there for two weeks and then me
and my mom are going to fly out after
his work is done and we're going to be
out there for a week so we're going to
do Machu Picchu which will be super
exciting and I'm just so excited we
haven't been traveling we haven't
traveled internationally since we went
to Paris um in january of last year so
i'm just excited to go on another trip
and it'll be so fun i've always wanted
to go to Machu Picchu um like so bad so
