this is going to be a gratis hull so
because I work in the beauty industry
when people tell you that they get a lot
of free stuff they are not lying get a
lot of free stuff I didn't realize how
much stuff I would get really until I
started working where I work if someone
asked me I'm just sorry to ramble but
someone asked me in the comments where I
work I just feel a little weird telling
you guys where I work only cuz um there
aren't that many locations and you could
find me is that weird I know I don't
think any of you guys are like creepy
but um I just don't feel one hundred
percent comfortable telling you guys but
it's not like Sephora alta or anything
like that so um anyway I just wanted to
throw that out that I saw that comment I
just um let's just keep it at the beauty
I work in the beauty industry let's keep
it there for now so back to this video
this is all stuff i'm calling it a halt
although i didn't pay for any of this
stuff this is all stuff that i got for
free from trainings when brands came in
um or from different things or
situations like that so it's all free
stuff I didn't get it sent to me it's
not like someone sent me this stuff to
my house cuz i do youtube but it was
because of where i work so my whole life
basically revolves around makeup i go to
makeup school right now I work full-time
in a beauty store and then i do youtube
and film beauty videos so it kind of
works out for me i'm gonna get into the
stuff that i got some of this stuff i've
used some of it I haven't used just a
ton of stuff I decided to only show full
size products just because if I showed
everything we'd seriously be here for
forever like little sample packets or
different things like that so um if I
can give you a small review I will if
you want a more in-depth review of
anything in this video just let me know
down below in the comments and I think
that's everything I mean thing let me
make sure that's everything I'm gonna
start off with the makeup first because
I think that'll be the most interesting
for you guys and then you guys can keep
watching if you want for like hair care
skin care that type of stuff let's do it
let's get into it so we carry gorgeous
cosmetics at our store and they decided
to send us some stuff i won this in a
contest like a spife contest which is
like we do monthly spiffs of like things
we sell or whatever so I won this
dust I shadow let me show you it oh my
gosh it's like impossible to get out of
this box gorgeous cosmetics is an
australian brand just to give you at
least a little bit of information that's
it there it is higher priced ticket
point to believe these are twenty
dollars apiece this one is in the color
moose mo usse and it's again called
their shimmer dust it's a loose pigment
eyeshadow I could have picked anything
from their line this is just what I
decided to go with I don't know I
thought I'd get the most use out of it i
just opened it so sorry i just got it
today that's a swatch of it there it's
kind of like this mavi warmer moth taupe
color it's really pretty I wanted to do
something a little bit different I
thought it'd be really pretty one
eyeshadow look which I have been liking
to do lately and it's something that I
probably wouldn't buy for myself but I
wanted to try out since it was free so
that's one of the things that I got and
then the other thing we each got to pick
something that we could have from
gorgeous cosmetics I think because
they're going to come in and train us
really soon so I first picked a
foundation like their base perfect
foundation i think is what it's called
they have a couple different types of
like coverage ones it was like the full
coverage one but they didn't have my
color and stock so instead I decided to
get a pressed powder this is what the
compact looks like I haven't opened this
yet either I just got it today and
that's what the powder looks like on it
you can't tell but it does have an
embossed like gorgeous on it this is in
the color Oh 3 PP pressed powder I'm
really excited for that I think it'll be
really nice and again I just thought I
go through powders so I didn't feel like
this is something that I was gonna sit
around in my drawer um today I'm excited
to use that up my Rimmel stay matte to
almost out I also have this lorac baked
matte satin blush in the color Hollywood
I got this because we were getting rid
of it for tester so I just sanitized it
and it's good to go they're really
pretty like it's the bottom one here
really pretty rusty kind of rose gold
but more uh golden like a peachy coral
eros go oh that was so hard to say um
it's really pretty it's very shimmery so
I don't have a shimmery blush but i
thought i will try this one out i think
it's really pretty for summer
have been kind of experimenting with
this I just need a little bit though a
light hand with this blush for sure
Smashbox and some stuff over to the
managers so I haven't done a training
with them or anything but they just I
just got stuff because I'm a manager I
guess I didn't question it I just said
awesome I'm sorry if you can see my bra
in this video i just got this new shirt
I'll show you got this from ASOS and it
says she'll yeah baby I really like it I
have huge fields if you guys don't know
that about me I know you could always
see me from like the neck up but I have
huge boobs and I think it's hilarious so
yeah anyway TMI but uh that's my life so
this is a smashbox primer this is just
their photo finish primer I got this for
free they sent this over and I have
tried this primer before I think it's
okay and I haven't opened it or anything
it's just in the box still I'm going to
keep it in the box until I use up more
primers I might just put this in my kid
or I don't know I kind of happen in the
box where I keep things that I haven't
used yet or touched so like someone like
let's say if someone really needed
something or I decide later on I don't
want it I haven't liked tested it out
like even just once and ruined it so I'm
trying really hard to get better at that
especially now that I'm getting so many
products in I need to be very cautious
about just wasting products and things
like that the other thing that Smashbox
sent over was the contour palette which
I was really excited about I know Emily
Noel I'm here on youtube like loves this
palette and I really haven't bought in
any of the contouring palette so it has
a matte highlighter it has a bronzer
color and then a contour shade i have
been using this I think it's really nice
i think the powders they're very silky I
think they're really nice or the lighter
ones up here you can't really see it
because I'm very fair the bronzer in the
middle and the contour at the bottom it
has been really nice I think they're
really pigmented but they blend out
really nicely and I have been enjoying
this I also put it in my kit for a
school and I enjoyed it using it that
way used it on the drag day so um again
I will be putting up a video once I
finished school which I only have two
more classes left for the theater
portion of the class then we're on a
high fashion but I
posting a video with like pictures of
all the different projects I did
throughout the course kind of like in a
montage you guys can see I thought it'd
be fun and someone said they'd like to
see it so I thought why not and then my
mom can see it too so anyway that's what
smashbox and through so i mean super
amazing and awesome almost done with the
makeup most recently i just had a
training with newt sticks which was so
exciting when i first started i was like
so excited that we carry dude sticks
because i had seen it on safaris website
and i was really interested in trying
the brand but i really had it so i've
been squatching them and playing with
them like every day since I've been
working and we finally got our training
with them and they were absolutely so
generous so for the training they gave
us this little upside down this little
tin which all the products come in tins
like this so it'll be like a tin with
one of their little nude sticks in it
inside like foam it's really cute
packaging and then the tin also has like
a mirror on the inside and how they
market this is kind of like this is your
new urban makeup bag so this little case
holds six pencils of theirs which you
could potentially do your whole face
with six different pencils because they
do pencils for the face in the lips and
the eyes and so this one came with five
products and I think a sharpener in it
and then we also were winning products
by answering questions about the line as
she was teaching it to us so I ended up
coming away with I'm not joking i
believe nine products and a sharpener
like I my mind my heart was like it it
was the best day it was my best day at
the job so far I was so excited I'll
start with their lip pencils which i
think i'm going to do a whole video just
dedicated to these so i might not swatch
them let me know if you want to see that
so i got three different lip and cheek
pencils this one is in the color mystic
this one here is mystic i also got the
color love and then this one is the
color sold now these can be used on the
lips or the cheeks you can also use them
as lip liner and they're really nice
they are in like a wood pencil form and
you just sharpen them like you would a
normal pencil so I got three of those
and to throw it out there to everything
in this line
details for 24 so it doesn't matter if
it's an eye product to lip product every
pencils $24 this is one of their like
skin portions of the line this is the
cleanup pencil now some of their eye
pencils they have two different
formulations one is like a super long
wearing one and one is like a sheer wash
of color so the ones that are super long
wearing they do not budge once you put
them on the skin so this is like a clean
up pencil and you can use it has hobo
oil in it to kind of clean up an area
maybe you made a mistake and you don't
want to redo your whole makeup you can
use this as kind of like a touch up and
then like clean it up with like a q-tip
or something it's really nice I think
it's really handy I'm I put that in my
kit this is another face product this is
the highlight and contour now I have
this in the light and medium so one side
is the highlighter and then the other
side is a contour now this contour is
very light so to me it's just like two
different shades of concealer or
something but I should have gone with
like a darker I should have gone with
probably a darker shade but this is the
one I got and the highlighter is nice I
got two shades and their long wearing
eye pencils this one's in the color moon
it's like a cream mat and then I also
have one called spirit which is like
kind of really similar actually to that
color there I can't find it I don't know
where it went and all my stuff here but
I did get two of those and those are the
ones that stay on your eyelids like all
day long last for like products I got
two of their twist up matte lip pencils
so what's interesting about these is
they're like a brush tip but they're
matte cream I have the color hypnotic
which is like a darker purple color and
then I also have the color bear which is
kind of like that darker mavi nude so
yeah I mean just absolutely blown away
by how like I just I think the whole
brand just everything I really liked it
so I'm gonna do a video on it just to go
more in depth because I know this is
going to be really long I already talked
too much but this is the sharpener that
came with it now the sharpener is like
that and then you can also use it as a
cap which is awesome okay I think that
is it for vision makeup items except for
like one more thing but it's also a
skincare brand so let's get into that I
was trained by a woman from realist
allora last still on this
an Italian pretty sure it's a talent
yeah it's an Italian brand I got a few
products one of the products i got was
the volumizing no I got the long lash
mascara now this is a just a regular
mascara that's what the wand looks like
it's a really basic one it's basically
just formulated to tint the eyes tint
the lashes and also it's opthamologist
tested so it's not going to hurt your
eyes it's just an overall really basic
good mascara if you have really
sensitive eyes this would be a good one
i am using it now i don't have any
problems with it like really smudging or
flaking or anything that at least other
mascaras it's it's not like amazing but
it's not bad it's a good basic one which
is really what it's marketed as it's not
marketed as anything more than that to
me now on to skincare this is real
Estelle's aqua face cleanser this smells
like roses it smells absolutely amazing
it is the face wash but you can also use
it as a body wash which is what I will
probably be doing because I love the
smell so much it's just a great overall
one it says moisturizing and rebalancing
with hyaluronic acid I'm excited to use
that once I get through some stuff
another full-size product that she gave
me was this micro eye contour cream this
is just a basic eye cream that helps
moisturize it's kind of like a pre
wrinkle one it doesn't have a time
anti-aging but it will obviously help
just because it's moisturizing with
anti-aging so kind of perfect for the
stage i'm at i'm only 23 so it's kind of
nice i haven't noticed that that one
really gets into my eyes too badly which
is an issue I have with like basically
any eye cream ever but I haven't noticed
it a ton of that but honestly I'm not a
loyal eye cream person oh I should be
but I'm not kill me I know this i've
used a lot of this is real Estelle's
micellar solution it's like a micellar
face water it's kind of basically like
bioderma or the simple one that I love I
also love this one it's nice it works
really well and the whole thing behind
in micellar water is that it's going to
kind of encapsulate whatever products on
your eye so you don't really have to rub
as much and I do find that this works
when I do that usually I don't have time
to just sit there and soak my I'll still
rub it a little bit man i suck I keep
telling you all the horrible things I do
but yeah I've really been enjoying this
you
and i use it basically every day i think
that this was really nice i believe this
bottle is twenty nine dollars i wouldn't
pay probably that much because i want to
try other ones and i just like the
simple one but you do get quite a bit of
product and it is a nice product it
works well not too too many more things
but kind of I have this peter thomas
roth sunscreen this is the anti age
defense SPF 30 uber dry sunscreen this
is just a really fast drying lightweight
sunscreen it goes on really nicely um I
have enjoyed this you can use it for the
face and body and like with any
sunscreen you're going to want to put it
on and then you reapply it every like
two hours or so this is a gold fat in md
dr. scrub advanced now this was the
first product I got for free ever
because I it's my first day working and
I have the training on them they let us
pick any product that we wanted after
the training and this is the one I chose
now this is I'm not going to open it
because it's basically loose little tiny
tiny little scrubbing particles in here
there's really no cream or anything to
hold them together it's just loose
particles and you use this and you will
put it with like a cleanser that you use
I like to put a little bit more cleanser
per product because I find it is like a
microdermabrasion this is a very intense
scrub I only do it once a week if that
because it definitely it doesn't hurts
like I'm not crying but it definitely is
an intense scrub and I just don't feel
comfortable doing it more than that for
my skin it's a great scrub though if you
really love that exfoliating feeling if
you like that physical exfoliant this is
totally your thing it's a great one they
also have the one before this is just
the doctor scrub and it is a creamy one
so it has actual like liquid and product
besides just the exfoliating beads to
scrub your skin with so if you want
something more like that that's what I
would check out but these are expensive
this was ninety-eight dollars that's
where it retails for i'm glad i got it
for free and this product will last me
like a whole year like a minimum like
you need the slightest amount usually
what I'll do is I'll just have my finger
and I'll just dip it in there like and
whatever is on it that's what I'll use
to scrub my face like you need nothing
this will last me for decades not really
but you know last for skincare these are
actually just
oxide samples but I thought it would
Chum to you because they gave me I
believe this is the whole line there's
only four products in the line and this
is stevie skin laps so these are
products that are going to be perfect
for any sensitive skin any type of skin
ailments that you want to correct first
thing here this is the calm moisture
this is advanced air for dry sensitive
face neck and scalp you can use these
products basically anywhere in the body
you can use them for babies you can use
them to breastfeed you can use them for
anything so this is kind of like a
lotion version of it you can use it for
diaper rash you can use it for bug bites
you can use it for sunburns you can use
it for anything like it's crazy you
basically use this for everything this
next little product this is the skin
bomb it's a restorative skin bomb it's
kind of like a petroleum jelly but it
doesn't have petroleum jelly in it but
it's that kind of texture if you've ever
tried the product you be it's kind of
like that and again these all fight
against the same thing this would be
great for like cuticles I'm chapped lips
chapped knees I mean anywhere you'd want
to put a more intense cream like that I
mean not to be graphic but if you're
breastfeeding in your nipples are
cracking you could use this on it so
it's just a great overall line this is
the body repair lotion this is going to
be a little bit less um moisturizing
than the cream but again same properties
same things that's fighting and then
last my favorite product in the line
this is the rescue and relief spray and
I really like this because you can use
this you can put it in the fridge and
use it for basically like as an aloe
vera it's a spray it feels like water
there is no greasy residue which is
something that I have a huge problem
with with any type of lotion I can't
handle it so I really like this product
because it just is it doesn't feel like
anything if you have someone who's bald
in your family they get summer and a lot
on their head you can spray this on the
scalp and it's not going to turn greasy
which I absolutely love maybe you have
eczema maybe you have a psoriasis that's
on your scalp or something like that I
really like that this product can go on
the scalp and not get it greasy you can
use it again for all the things i
mentioned rashes burns anything it's
like a miracle product and i'm really
excited about this line okay we only
have hair products left guys I'm really
so
I'll try to do these more often because
it kind of got built up but you know
okay hard I have two pro two products
from Renee Fortier because they came in
this is the me and Sam we've already
been using this this is an etcher iya
frequent use shampoo it's just a very
everyday type of shampoo it's okay it's
a very liquidy and runny so that's a
little different for me texture-wise it
also smells really fragrant like herbs
tho like a literal garden it smells nice
though I do like it it's just a everyday
shampoo it's not meant to volumize or do
anything special it's just very your
general shampoo this is a tenishia
anti-age toning and densifying
conditioning treatment so you put this
on your hair and you're gonna do it I
believe before I get in the shower maybe
after anyway this is going to help grow
your hair and make it thicker so I'm not
talking about like I'm volumizing it in
the sense of like making the cuticle
blown out and and then when you wash
your hair that cuticle get small again
and so it's not volumize anymore this is
supposed to be helping actually grow the
width of your hair and make your hair
thicker long term so this is a long-term
product you'd use it multiple times you
continue to use this product to see the
results of it I have not even busted it
out because I'm not ready to commit
myself and I don't to waste it yet so
you know this is kind of another
treatment product but it is a shampoo
this is from DS laboratories now I know
Stevie lab now this DS laboratories this
is a shampoo that's going to help grow
your hair so um it has basically two
things and it's all just say it there's
an apple a polymer in here that's going
to help stimulate the scalp and help
grow hair and there's also a copper
peptide that's going to help break down
THC I don't know there's something that
cause is caused by testosterone that
kind of blocks your scalp or so the
woman said and copper is going to help
break down that layer so that you can
unsuck ate those follicles and have hair
growth so it's supposed to help promote
hair growth for women and men
so like hair growth here at the crown
and also at the back viens ever been
using it and I mean this is something
again you're going to want to use
products like this long term especially
if it's not stress related hair loss and
it is something like aging um you're
going to want to do it you're gonna have
to fight aging hair loss always I mean
you're going to just especially if its
genetic like you're just going to have
to fight it if you want to keep your
hair so or you can just go john
malkovich on it and go bald and awesome
but or billy corgan but anyway oh yeah
that's what we're using right now me and
Sam and um it's a nice shampoo it smells
nice it doesn't have sulfates in it you
can use it on as a body wash as well if
you wanted this one I just got today
it's hard to see it I'm sorry it's jf
lazar tEEX soy serum soy milk
strengthening serum so this is for dry
and delicate hair which is what I have
although my head I have like an oily
scalp but the hair down at the bottom is
definitely dry I feel like half the
reason I have oily scalp is only because
I have barely any hair so if I produce a
normal amount of oil I don't have as
much hair to soak it up so it looks oily
or faster these are all things i just
have thought of my hair i don't know i'm
not an expert this is like a serum for
your hair so you put it on when it's dry
and i don't know i'm really excited to
try this because you guys see my hair in
these videos my hair is crazy and
honestly I just don't I can't be
bothered I don't want to deal with it
but I feel a little self-conscious about
it more so lately than I have before in
my life but I kind of wanted to try this
and do my hair a little bit more and
kind of see if I can you know fix fix
the problems and I feel like I have with
my hair and see if this works one she
did a whole presentation we got to pick
one item we wanted so I picked this
instead of like a shampoo to see how it
works oh my gosh thank you so much for
hanging through with me on this video
again if you want something in more
depth i did talk a lot about these
products but if you want something more
in depth or if you want something maybe
there's a line here and you want a
different product just leave it in the
comments and I will try to do those
videos for you I hope you guys are all
having a wonderful day and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
