it's Lauren I thought we could start off
this coupling of videos in a favorites
video I do like a top five favorites so
just five things I've been loving
throughout the month nothing too much I
think too crazy because I'm a project
panner I don't have a ton of new
products coming in so I don't have a ton
of like new items to show you but I do
have some things and it's nice to share
things you really been liking and I like
looking back and trying to reflect on
things I actually loved because
sometimes you get caught up and you
don't remember everything you like or
love that month and it's fun to go back
and be like oh yeah that was awesome oh
yeah that was awesome so if you're
feeling down you can go back and look at
your favorite and first and foremost um
this is beauty related because I am a
makeup artist but I have been doing more
gigs than I ever have before and more
legit gigs I guess you could say which
is really really awesome I recently
worked on a reality TV show I don't want
to tease you but I'm not sure a hundred
percent if I can say what show it is I
know I had to sign some some things
where I can't like say I know I can't
say something not exactly sure so I'm
just playing it safe and not saying
anything I am working on it again so i
might get confirmation on that if you
guys want to know but that is really
exciting I mean it's a legit gig it's a
legit show you guys have probably heard
of it and it's just really cool to be
working on like a real show and get like
a real day right that's really cool I've
never actually got a day right before so
that's been really amazing i also worked
on a parody music video if you guys
follow me on instagram you probably saw
pictures of the beards i did for it i
was brought on as just an assistant
someone else was heading it and brought
me on and it's just a parody music video
but I thought it turned out really well
and it was just fun to work on something
like that so i actually will leave that
linked down below kind of a little plug
here they don't like no I have a channel
or anything but I just thought it'd be
nice to like send some views their way
and I am really proud of it i think it
turned out really well it's a parody of
like a rap song so i know not all of you
guys like love it but if you're
interested even in the slightest
definitely go check it out i'll leave it
linked down below also my name is
spelled wrong in the credits so if you
see that I'm only telling you this just
so that you don't point it out or
you don't need to tell me because I
already know yeah my name is Laurel
mm-hmm but definitely go check it out
i'm not like upset I mean it's things
happen and it sucks but it's not like a
big deal I'm literally just telling you
guys that so no one brings it to my
attention like if as if I didn't know
but yeah please go check it out if you
want to again if you want to see what
work I did specifically on it my
Instagram shows a picture of the three
different like beards that I late for
that music video ok so those those are
just like to stand out times and things
i did this month but overall it's just
been an exciting month to have those
gigs and to just continue getting gigs
and working as a makeup artist I really
didn't think that I wanted to do gigs
and the more I do the more I realize
like man I am confident and I am
comfortable and I can do this and I
think a lot of what was holding me back
in making me not want to do gigs was
just anxiety and fear and a little bit
of doubt in myself it's just been nice
to be on set and feel comfortable and
feel like I got this and I think that it
just takes time and you just have like
exposure therapy but um I think if you
really want something if you get scared
a couple of times just like keep going
for it and if you're meant to do it i
really think that it will just come
naturally to you eventually and you
won't feel nervous and if you don't want
to feel nervous you just have to keep
like chipping away any anxiety you have
and also just kind of like let it go if
you feel like nervous about something or
something didn't go exactly right just
take it as a learning experience it's
not the end of the world like the worst
that could happen is what you know so
anyway that's a favorite of mine will
keep going we'll keep moving on if you
guys want me to talk more about this
type of stuff I'm thinking about doing I
don't know if I mentioned this in a
video yet but I think I'm gonna do like
a makeup artist type of series like my
favorite things or like must-haves in my
kit things i use on set every single
time my favorite products for this
someone saw my tattoo thing that i did
which I also did the tattoos like if you
see my tattoo sheet on my Instagram I
made I printed out a bunch of tattoos
and we use this on set as part of it as
well so someone asked me about like
doing a video on fake tattoos which i
might do as well i thought that would be
a good one so I'm thinking about doing a
series like that if you're interested
let me know I think I might I might just
sneak them in every now and then I just
feel like there are so many videos I
always have to film it's crazy so hope I
can get those in here pretty soon I have
like a million things I need to get in
pretty soon so next favorite let's move
on these are like three makeup items the
first one is this powder from what and
while this is the cover all pressed
powder I have the shade light which I
believe is the lightest color i bought
this in Arizona we went back to Arizona
for a weekend this month and I was like
I need a powder I haven't been liking
the way my foundation has been looking
I'm still working on it there's just
more texture of my skin than I'm used to
especially on my nose like when I blend
stuff on my nose it'll like blend off my
base makeup which is super frustrating
and I really haven't had that many
issues with that before so frustrating
but anyway all my powders are too dark
for me and I just needed a lighter
powder I didn't want to spend a lot of
money personally I don't have a ton of
money right now that's part of the
reason I haven't been spending much on
make it because I don't even have much
to spend but I wanted something cheap
and I wanted just to see if it would
work and you know I just thought
something is better than what I have i
bought this powder and i feel like i can
already see the honeycomb pattern like
i'm gonna hit pan on this in like 4
seconds because i like am a powder
powder hungry i was going to say powder
whore but oh yeah a powder heart let's
just say it i love powder i like matte
skin I like I just I like to powder
really heavily and then throughout the
day kind of be fine as I blot away oil
and this powder is really nice I feel
like this is 318 I think it has really
good coverage it feels really soft I
feel like it doesn't look powder on the
skin but it's also not one of those
powders that makes me oily throughout
the day like the maybelline fit me I'm
just really happy with this I definitely
think I had to purchase this and
something I love about it is because i
use a lot of powder i don't feel guilty
or like oh no I shouldn't use as much as
I actually want to because I'm trying to
like save money our safe product I can
just I don't feel guilty using as much
as I want of this on my face so if
you're looking for something cheap
something to switch it up I don't know
this one's just really good i'm just
really enjoying it and i love that it's
really cheap and this is a little bit
creamier I feel like
the Rimmel stay matte to me they're
almost a matt is a dryer powder than
this these are like a beauty related
item it's not actual makeup but I posted
about this on my Instagram and I'm just
like plugging away no but I post about
these on my Instagram I think I solved
the link so i will link it down below as
well about these off of ebay for 99
cents and then i'm not talking about
like nine tons of peace all five four
ninety-nine cents and if you can't tell
these look a lot like the Real
Techniques one Real Techniques ones Oh
Real Techniques ones that is so freaky
to say it's freaking my brain anyway I
really like these brushes they are super
duper soft I word a bunch of stuff off
ebay recently and I want to do like a
babe Russians dupes thing or just like
an ebay holla got a bunch of eyelashes
as well because eyelashes are expensive
and i don't want to pay that much so i'm
excited to get what i got cuz I spent
quite a bit of money but I got so much
for what I spent and haven't been on
ebay in the longest time this is like a
stinking great deal they did raise the
price to 299 because they probably
realized like oh wow it's too good of a
deal like I don't understand it blows my
mind that they can send these from China
to me for ninety-nine cents free
shipping and still make money like my
mind cannot wrap itself around how cheap
it must cost to manufacture these or how
many they're sending in their big huge
like cards across the ocean anyway
getting into my brain will stop um but I
really like these let's get into them
really fast this is just like the flat
one a flat kabuki brush the cut isn't
amazing on this cuz I kind of thought
maybe it was the angled one but I mean
it's super soft for the price again you
can't beat it I use this to blend in my
I think I use this for powder foundation
and it works really well for that this
is another like buffing brush this looks
like the one in the orange packaging and
this is really soft it's domed I use
this for my actual life liquid
foundation today I really liked it this
is another buffing brush but it's a
flattop angled brush really like the
super soft this is what I don't quite
know how I'm gonna use I thought oh I
could blend out concealer under my eyes
but it didn't quite work that way for me
so I'm still working on trying to figure
out the best way for this it's
really dense it feels nice though I'm
soft I do like it i'm just working with
it and then probably my favorite brush
from this set which this one looks like
really really close to one that they
have and i know a lot of people won't
like it because i feel like people don't
like duo fiber brushes but i love them
because for HD makeup you need something
very very light i do my makeup way
differently than necessarily what I do
to people on set and I like that this
has a lot of give it's not super dense
and you can just buff on foundation just
very lightly if you want i just really
like this brush i will say it has shed a
little bit nothing like insane and I'm
hoping it will stop now I still love it
and for the price again 99 cents four or
five brushes like that's like less than
25 cents for this brush like I said they
raised the price to 299 for the set but
that's still an amazing deal I will have
it linked down below if you want to
check it out pretty awesome I'm really
happy with these I couldn't be happier I
i bought these thinking they were gonna
be like this big or something cuz it was
so cheap and for them to come and be
like proper size and actually work well
and be amazing dupes it my mind
obviously is blown into pieces i'll try
to hurry it up I'm so sorry guys I'm
talking a lot in this video next I have
a shadow here and this is a shadow by
Mac called antiqued I had this in my
haul video i will leave a link down
below and i feel like i threw a little
bit of shade at this guy kind of was
like I bought it because a lot of people
said they really liked it blah blah blah
I don't know I just felt like when I got
this I was just a little disappointed
it's just kind of basic and boring as
you can see I've definitely been using
it has a little bit of a dent going on
in there I love this in the outer corner
just like in the outer portion of the
eye to just deepen it up and give a
little bit more contrast to the eye it
is a shimmer finish that's its watch
there it's not like super metallic or
anything so I feel like if I bring it
into the crease a little bit it's not a
big deal I just really have been
enjoying this way more than I thought I
would have and I love that it's not too
dark i am quite fair so something like
black or really really dark brown can
just get a little too heavy for me this
gives me the
moved amount of contrast just for an
everyday look I can deepen it up it's
pretty deep today usually go a little
lighter than this but I went a little
heavier handed I guess I just really
have been liking this color I think it's
really great and I kind of wanted to
just like apologize to it because again
I threw a little shade on it when I was
hauling it and my last favorite are just
a music favorites I've really been
liking drinks and album views if you
guys don't know I don't talk about it a
lot but I'm like number one drink van
like I'm his number one fan musically
I'm not saying I like know everything
about his life but like music wise
obsessed so I really been liking one
dance obviously but I have been
listening to that before the like album
came out so I'm not like over it I'm
just saying you know that's like a basic
song from the album like you got to know
more than that I like controla a lot and
I really like child's play I just like
that song I you know I think people can
relate like who wants to fight a
cheesecake no one wants to fight at
cheesecake anyway I really been lying
that album and it's been a little
different for me all his other albums i
have on a CD so i like listening to them
in order and all of them and not just
like skipping through but this one i
have been listening to on spotify so i
don't know like all the songs yet and I
don't know the order which is like just
weird for me I'm pretty old school when
it comes to CDs but that has been a
favorite I'm sorry if you can hear the
construction I don't know what's going
on another song that I've really been
liking I've really been enjoying Weezer
when we went on a road trip we were
listening to weezer I really love the
song only in dreams I'm just like
obsessive that song you think it's so so
good just really obsessed with it and
then another band to the smashing
pumpkins I've just really been enjoying
their music lately and I just think the
leak organs voice is just sexy and I
just been in doing that hello those are
all my favorites I hope you guys enjoyed
a little different but that's how life
is these are just my life favorites kind
of revolving around make a fish kind of
i hope you guys enjoyed and I will see
you on my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
