is it so frustrating so I decided to
film my haul video and I think that's
only I know I said I was gonna feel a
million videos but that's a lie I'm only
gonna film this one this is like a
random pink bag and it is from an asian
beauty store I had I'm rosetta stone I
had friends here from Arizona and we
went to Koreatown and it was really fun
and so I picked up some beauty stuff I
haven't used any of it yet I just
thought it'd be fun I'll bring my
spirits up because this is super
frustrating frustrating especially the
first thing that I got was this cute
cute little eye patch this is my little
pet from tony moly and yeah i think it's
just a gel thing you put on to type d
puffs not much of it is in English it
was four dollars so i thought that was a
pretty good price for what it is i got
two sets of lashes these say they're
from the brand darkness I don't really
know I chose these ones because they
have the clear band and those are my
favorite types of lashes to deal with so
they're really similar this one's just a
little bit these ones are longer and
these ones are a little bit shorter but
they're more wispy I feel like they're
good for like every day they don't
really have too much of a characteristic
to make them like cartoony or lookie or
something I'm not a super last person
but I thought these were nice and those
were two 45 so there were 250 apiece
this was something I was really excited
about so excited I opened it this is the
dolly wink eyeliner when I first started
YouTube this is so popular this is a
black eyeliner but it's like a brush tip
instead of like a felt tip and it is
quite nice nice and black that's what I
use to do my wing today and I forgot how
nice these were the kat von d ones also
like a brush tip and you really can just
get that point so much easier than with
the felt tip so I super like this so far
it's 17 something which is cheaper than
the kat von d 1 so that works for me and
i'm really glad i tried this out I've
heard so much and I finally got it and
tried it for myself I got a few things
from the brand baby face because it's
like a drug store asian brand and it was
cheap a lot of the stuff was expensive
so I didn't want to like go too crazy
this is a brow pencil in the color
blonde 03 I'll open it up
camera is about to die story of my life
today I'm even filming on like a
different camera now that is the stroke
this is the one end and it kind of has
that like you know hourglass one where
it's like a rectangle that is a swatch
of it there i'm excited to try it it was
499 so it wasn't that bad of a price and
then that's a little spooley on it so I
thought it'd be nice I like I go through
brow pencil so I didn't feel like it be
wasteful I got another Tony Tony gosh
another tony moly product i believe this
is the peach hand cream I have wanted
this a long time I've seen it a lot of
different places it smells so good like
peaches I love the smell of peach and
it's so adorable I couldn't resist this
is ten dollars oh it's so cute it looks
like a little peach Sam thought it
looked like an onion I think it looks
like a peach I got this little blush
from baby faces wow this is in the color
I don't know but okay it's so cute it
has like a little baby on it so cute and
then it comes with this little powder
puff with like a little bow hopefully
you guys can see that hopefully that's a
little better but it's just like a
little boat puff and it's like a while a
key color I'm excited to try this out it
is quite white lilac it's up here I
don't know if you can see this was only
I think 499 to word or something it
wasn't too expensive the powder feels
really nice quality like silky so that
is something else I got and then so
there's really only two more things in
here I got two little little brushes so
this one here it's so hard to see is
this tiny tiny detail brush I thought to
be perfect for my kit it says precision
liner brush for a mystique and this is
this is 399 and then this one's very
similar but it's a little bit longer and
it's angled and this one is the small
angle from mystique so I thought these
would be great for detail work sometimes
you just need the tiniest little brush
to get in there and do the job for you
and I thought this would be really nice
they gave me some serums I think it's
all the same serum yet the X 2 D 2
original Hydra serum so I don't even
know the brand but that's everything I
got at the Asian like an asian beauty
store at the korean like market where we
were in Koreatown i hope you guys enjoy
this and I will
my next videos hopefully it'll be about
our situation with the battery but um I
hope you guys are all doing well have a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
