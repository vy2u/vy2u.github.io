thought I would take this time really
fast to just kind of give you guys a
little mini life update I know a lot of
you guys follow me on Instagram and I
had posted saying that Sam had an
accident at work and that he had
basically chopped his thumb off um yeah
so I thought I would just kind of update
you guys on that I also wanted to thank
you guys so so much for all of your kind
words all of your thoughts and prayers
something you don't realize and tell
something serious happens as me and
zoomer alone out here I've made friends
but I can't comment mom up and have her
drive me to the hospital or drive to the
hospital with me or anything like that
like I'm alone you know like I have to
go to this random Hospital I've never
been to by myself and find parking and
the only other person I know is the
person in the hospital sitting on a bed
so if you guys are kind of like my
connection and support group and all
these other things so I just really
appreciate all of your kind words I just
wanted to say thank you I'm here so I
guess I'll tell you guys a little bit
about the situation I don't know I don't
know how much ears want to hear so Sam
was at work he works in a hotel and he
does AV stuff so he works a lot of
different equipment and different things
he was moving a TV that hat that was on
a stand and it was like a telescoping
stand and he was moving it the pin
wasn't all the way clicked it was in it
enough to be moving it around earlier in
the day but for whatever reason it
unlatched and the piece of the
telescoping part of the stand that held
the TV up came and smashed his finger
and because of like just the force and
the weight of it it totally took that
part of his finger off so he luckily
didn't take off his whole thumb or
anything but it took off all of this
part of his sounds like completely
severed they called it an amputation and
it did hit bone a little bit too so he
had like a bone fracture when I was at
the hospital like I had mentioned a part
of his thumb was inside a bag sitting
next to him because Sam when it happened
she told me that he ran I'm telling you
to freaks me out it gives me was like
it's so queasy
he had it happened to him he started
like kind of freaking out
he ran down two flights of stairs to go
tell security and
he made one of the security guards go up
with him to go find the other piece of
his bone because he couldn't find it and
it was like inside the mechanism I know
I'm so sorry like a little TMI right um
but that's how Sam is he so like logical
like oh I've heard that you should try
to like to save the piece so they could
try to reattach it so like he went back
up while his thumb is off to go find the
other piece of his thumb oh my gosh so
that happened he called me I started
freaking out immediately because I
didn't know how bad it was and I know
Sam he was in an accident once before in
a car accident and he tried to act like
it wasn't a big deal and later we find
out that his hands fracture and then the
guy who like saw the car and was giving
us our insurance for it it was like oh
I'm lucky to be talking to you today Sam
just under exaggerates everything like
the opposite of dead grades that's Sam
he just makes it seem like it's not a
big deal so I'm freaking out I meet him
at the hospital and they tell us
different things they first were gonna
do surgery on his hand and then they
were gonna just not put the piece back
on it all and just leave it what they
ended up doing was selling the piece
entirely back on and using it as like a
biological band-aid hoping that it will
take but it's probably not gonna take
it's basically just there to help it
heal and not be so exposed it's a couple
weeks after the incident now luckily I
mean he can still move this whole hand
and it's so nice that it wasn't at like
a joint if he could still bend his thumb
we're hoping that his nerves and all of
that type of stuff will heal but I mean
he's on medical leave for at least a
month if not two months we just kind of
have to see how it heals and how things
go and if he wants to do surgery or how
much of the thumb piece takes it's kind
of just like a waiting game at this
point yeah so that being said I know
it's kind of I kind of had like a
mishmash story so I'm sorry I just
thought I'd give you a little bit of
details I'm gonna ask him if he's okay
with me leaving pictures at the end of
this and if he is I will leave them at
the end of the huge disclaimer
beforehand so if you don't want to see
him you won't be like shocked I'm not
trying to be like The Exorcist amaze
thing on y'all but I might leave those
at the end if I can I'll let you know in
the description if they're there but
it's just kind of a weird situation it's
also weird because
serious injury like it's a really
serious injury in the sense that he
can't work I mean it was an amputation
take a piece of his finger width off of
him but at the same time it's not like
his legs he can still walk around he can
still go to the beach he can still do
stuff so it's kind of this weird mix I'm
used to being home alone by myself
and so now Sam's here and it's just
difficult to be able to like film and to
get stuff done and for both of us to be
productive but also like still hang out
because we love to hang out with each
other so just basically my daily routine
has changed so much in the last probably
like three weeks since the accident it's
probably like two and a half weeks since
the accident so luckily he's okay it
could have been so much worse like so
much worse so I'm really happy that he's
fine and everything's okay but
definitely a bit of us err I thought I
would just update you guys and that's
part of the reason why I didn't post for
a long time and I'm hoping to get back
on track with everything now that Sam
can do a little bit more with his finger
I mean it still hurts he can't really
touch it at all or anything but he can
definitely do more than he could in the
first like a week week and a half
it was so sore and hurts so much so yeah
I thought I'd update you let you know
what's going on in my life and hopefully
I'll be having a job soon - I have a few
interviews lined up so hopefully I I can
be working at some point soon things
just are constantly changing that's just
how life is but I just wanted to say
thank you so much that was like really a
big part of why I wanted to do this it's
just to say thank you for all of the
people who were so kind and so
thoughtful and I appreciate it so much
so anyway that's everything I will see
you in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
