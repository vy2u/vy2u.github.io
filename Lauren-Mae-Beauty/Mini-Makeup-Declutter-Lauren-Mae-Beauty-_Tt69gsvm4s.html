of the mess around here you can see back
here on bookshelf there is nothing on it
and that is because we are moving we are
slowly moving into our new apartment
because there's kind of a lapse in our
leases so it's kind of been a little
annoying that it's a slow move but it's
kind of nice at the same time that it's
we're able to kind of take its own it's
not so rushed and crazy but anyway just
bear with me on that this video is going
to be a mini to clutter so since we're
moving I've been going through my makeup
I need to pack it up and I thought hey
why don't I go through all this stuff
that I have and see what I can get rid
of because I don't want to take
something with me or like put it back in
my drawers when I get to this new place
and I reset up my drawers in this new
place I don't want to put stuff back in
my drawers that I don't want so let me
go through the stuff that I decluttered
I got rid of more than I thought I would
since I did just do my decluttering back
in like march or so but that's a good
thing so let's get into it i'll start
with the things that i'm getting rid of
because they're expired i'm getting rid
of this urban decay to joyce riser this
is in the color halo and i did not
realize that this was expired it expired
quite a while ago I'm pretty sure the
reason it expired is because of the SPF
in it because it doesn't smell bad or
anything like that but since it was so
long ago I'm just gonna get rid of it
it's not worth me breaking out I already
I'm dealing with those issues and I
don't want to put this on my face so
even though this was an item I wanted to
use up for the year I'm just going to
toss it it's better to just toss it than
to try to use it up for me this is the
other thing that was expired this is the
juice beauty stem cellular repair CC
cream in warm glow this also has SPF in
it and I think again that's why the
expirations on it it's um it expired
like the end of last year and I didn't
realize it it's just a little deluxe
sized sample so I did have this in my
foundation drawer but I'm going to be
getting rid of that as well so those are
just going to be into the trash those
aren't going to be going into like my
treasure chest of items
and I actually did have one more item
that's expired this is the duo eyelash
adhesive I got this a long time ago and
I was going through it and it's just
kind of separated and nasty and I have
one in my kid if I really needed it I
don't were lashing all the time and it's
just too old so I'm getting rid of it I
have decided to let go of these urban
decay cream blushes now these are older
but there's nothing wrong with them they
don't smell weird they don't look weird
nothing like that I just have decided to
come to terms with the fact that i'm not
going to wear them i'm not going to use
them up there's other cream blushes in
my collection that I would pick before
these I've never used them except for
this one which is in indecent I have
used that one but other than this one I
have not used this bang color it's
called bang that's really hard to say i
have not used this one at all and then
the last one here grade I just haven't
easy there and it's like a purpley color
so I'm just being realistic with myself
and gonna get rid of these I did buy one
of those steel a watercolor blushes and
I would rather use that up then use
these so I just had a real
heart-to-heart with myself and they're
going to go um since since they don't
smell bad I'm fine with giving them to
friends if they want them type of thing
and yeah everyone has their own thing on
that but they don't smell they're not
weird nothing like that they look
exactly how they were when I got them so
yeah if anyone has a problem with that
um this little guy here this is a tard
cream shadow in the color shimmering
moss and it is like a khaki color or
something like that it's like an olive
green I just I'm not going to use up the
whole thing of this so i might as well
well it's still barely use like
basically just watched i might as well
give someone else a chance to use it
before it goes bad so that's going out
of my collection it's already
hard enough for me to use darker colors
and then added make it a grain and it's
like impossible so again just being real
with myself I'd love to use it up but I
know that in my heart that I won't and
again I have so much makeup I'd rather
be using up the stuff that I love than
worrying about a color that I don't even
like and using up a whole little product
of it like not worth it to other cream
shadows that I'm getting rid of this is
a stick one from NYX this is in the colo
colo this is a jumbo pencil from NYX
this is in the color french fries I'm
getting rid of this because I already
have a color basically exactly like it
and I don't need to Plus this formula
does not stay in my eyes all day so it
will crease on me so I'd rather have the
one that doesn't crease and get rid of
this one so that's going out but there's
nothing wrong with that and then this is
a Revlon Colorstay smoky shadow stick I
was a smoky shadow blast in the color
torch and I bought this because we were
on our honeymoon and I'm swatching it
for you guys we're on our honeymoon and
I saw this you can barely see it I'm
kind of washed out your guys sorry um
and I was like oh my gosh I heard so
much about this when they were out it
was really cheap at the store so I got
it and it's just lame to me I have so
many other items in my collection that
do what this does x 10 and they're just
better so I just again I don't want to
use this product up want to have other
things like it so it's gonna go and find
another home for someone else who will
love it I have three eyeliners that I'm
going to get rid of their all liquid
this first one is a liquid liner from
NYX in the color brown it's just like an
inkwell type of liner so yeah I've never
used this it came in some bag that I got
probably an Ipsy bag and I'm just never
going to use a brown liquid liner I
never have and if I did
have a pen of it so yeah I'm getting rid
of that speaking of a pen brown liquid
liner this is Jordana's fab you later
this is just drying out so I'm probably
just going to toss this one um and I
just again I like a black liquid liner
not this one so I'm getting rid of that
and the third line are here this is be a
bombshell and it's a liquid pen liner
now it is just too thick of a line for
me it's decently black but i just don't
like a thick one like this so I'd rather
someone else get to use it and I just
don't I've never used it it's been a
it's been sitting in there and I've
never grabbed for it and I know when I
run out of my e purl 1 i'm gonna go run
and buy out by something that I like
instead of using this one so i might as
well get rid of it now everything else
in my little basket here our lip product
so we'll just get into them i'm getting
rid of two of these Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stings this one is in
romantic it's like a red and then this
one is in cherish and it's like a pink I
will swatch them for you guys this one
I'm getting rid of because it's just not
actually read and I don't need a balm
balm II read I have other things like
this and I don't need this in my
collection this one I'm just getting rid
of because I haven't reached for it
since my last aclarar and I'm really
just not going to it is a very cool tone
pink and I don't really use this type of
color I'd rather go with like a more
fuchsia or something so I just I just am
NOT gonna use them that's seriously what
happened this is either i haven't used
it or i know i'm not going to so the
other lipstick i have in here is this
kate moss one this is the one I actually
got in my influence or box and the
formula is fine I just don't like the
color this is it's just like a pink
color it's in number 33 that's it there
it's just not something I gravitate to
so I'd rather someone else get to use it
and not me I'm gonna turn down the iris
it's too bright hopefully that's a
little bitter this is a lip injection by
2 feet
it's a plumping one but it's in like a
weird brown shiny color and I don't know
it's just I don't know I feel like this
is going to go bad or it smells fine it
smells sweet like they all all the lip
plumpers do from them but I just have
done with it I'm going to throw that one
away and then i have this bareMinerals
Moxie marvelous moxie and daredevil I
got this in an Ipsy bag and this is just
like a shimmery berry color that's its
watched there I just haven't used it i
don't think i'm going to use it i don't
use lip glosses and if i'm going to do a
dark club i'm probably going to go mad
and probably going to go darker than
this and i just don't see myself using
this in my collection so i hope you guys
enjoyed this video it was just like a
mini declutter video i'm probably going
to be doing these more not more often
but i'm not going to be doing like a big
declutter probably for a while because
it haven't really been buying makeup i
hope you enjoyed it again i will see you
in my next video i'm gonna film quite a
few today just so i have stuff up while
we're moving and things like that so i
will see you in the next one hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
