is going to be a really mini mini haul
from sephora i got a couple of things
because they gave a coupon out for i
believe it was just for vib rouge but it
was 25 off a fifty dollar purchase and i
felt like i did really well black friday
and for the vib sale for november and
everything I didn't buy anything I
didn't buy any makeup I didn't buy
anything like that so I was really proud
of myself for sticking to not buying
stuff for that time and I just thought
25 off of fifty dollar purchase was a
really great deal and you could kind of
pick whatever you wanted and i just
thought i was gonna actually use that 1i
told Sam and I was like you know I'm
gonna do him and I get a couple things
and while i was on the site i was really
trying to be really picky I wasn't
trying to get any I shadows I didn't
want to get anything that I was just
buying on a whim because I had a coupon
I really wanted it to be stuff that I
would use up no I've used up or things
that I've liked in the past I just
wanted to really pick out things that
were gonna be good buys in my head so I
got a couple of things i'm going to show
you that here it should be pretty fast
because i didn't want to go too far over
fifty dollars because it's trying to
contain myself trying to keep it cool
two of the big purchases were primers i
am a primer girl i love primers so much
I just don't feel like my skin looks as
good without a primer and there have
been two that I've tried this last year
that I just loved so much and I thought
this is a great time for me to get those
items and really just enjoy them in my
collection and actually use them so the
first one I got is the Clinique super
primer this is the universal face primer
I really like this because it's kind of
a mix between like a silicone feeling
primer and a lotion primer it doesn't
feel quite like either it feels like
they're mixed which would be in between
I just really like it I put this all
over my face and I think it helps with
oil control it's like twenty seven
dollars i believe for this size and this
is the full size but i just i really
like it i really like this primer and I
don't feel like I've liked a primer that
much in a long time so I really wanted
get that one because it was just
something I knew was already on my list
and I thought that's a good by the other
primary got was the Smashbox photo
finish pore minimizing primer I just got
the small one and someone i watch here
on YouTube I think it's Heatherette
Heatherette or someone Heatherette with
numbers or I'm so sorry I don't remember
the name she was talking about how this
is the mini size which is sixteen
dollars but the original size is only
double this and it's 38 so if you got
two of these would be cheaper or
whatever so I just thought I'd go with
the cheaper one because i only use this
in the areas where i have really big
poor so i use it in this area of my face
i put a dot on my nose on my forehead
and just like on my chin this just helps
me smooth out to any texture issues i
might have and I really enjoy this I
think it helps with keeping oil at bay
as well it's just a really good one so I
use these together and i love them i
really like it i'm so happy i got these
all right and really the last full-size
thing i got was a liquid lipstick from
kat von d this is in Lolita I was
between this one and bow and arrow but I
thought Lolita is like the classic one
that everyone wants in the fact that it
was even in stock was like a big deal
because it's like always out of stock
it's always out of stock in store and
online so i thought i would pick this
one up it's what i'm wearing now and I
really really like it I love liquid
lipsticks lately I'm really excited to
try some of the colour-pop ones let me
know what your opinions are down below
because I know that a lot of people are
back and forth or like there's like half
of the people love them half that people
don't like them but they're just such a
good value and I kind of want to try
them so um I've just been loving liquid
lipsticks lately and so I thought I'm
gonna get one of these and I'm glad I
did this is kind of my fun item to get i
think i'm going to count this as one of
my five lipsticks even though it's not
quite 2016 yet i think i'm going to
count it just because it that rule in my
resolution beauty resolutions video is
only going to help me keep my collection
at a minimum and two items i really love
and I'm okay with this being one of the
five if you haven't seen that video just
go watch it you'll enjoy it
this was a deluxe a sample that I was
able to get with like a code or
something so this is the Stila huge
extreme lash mascara this is one of
their newer items I believe that came
out with like the spring collection or
whatever this has an hourglass shaped
brush which is very similar to the
better than sex by Too Faced so I'm
excited to try this out I would sell
this at work whenever we were out of the
two faced one because it was like a
similar concept and I haven't opened it
yet so I'm not going to show you guys
now but I am excited to try this out
it's a nice deluxe I sample mascara is
always a nice one to get for free I
thought since this was a really small
hall I would show you the samples that I
picked out that you get the three free
ones on the website so i thought i'd
show you those i've already used up one
this is the Anthony glycolic exfoliating
and resurfacing wipe this wipe was
actually pretty nice i did like it i
didn't think the smell was too strong a
chemical or something one side had like
kind of a bumpy texture to it and you
were supposed to use that scrub your
face down and then use the other side
which was smoother and kind of wipe away
anything like go over skin one last time
I thought it was nice i didn't notice
anything to amazing but it's just one
wipe as soon as i got them i put them in
my bathroom on my counter like staring
at me every night so that i'd actually
used them up and i've already gotten one
down so you guys know from that beauty
resolutions video i was trying to make
sure i'm using samples within two weeks
of getting them so i'm working on that
currently to this is a sample that I've
gotten in the past and used up this is
the you be moisturizing skin cream I
kind of use this for a specific purpose
I use it on my nose I have really dry
nose creases know what you would call
that but they get really dry and it
doesn't really matter how much i
exfoliate them or anything they just
cake up with makeup they look really dry
all the time it just sucks and this is
something that really does help i put
this on since i got it but i've done it
in the past i put this on every night
like in that area and i find that it
really just helps heal that area keep it
more moisturize so makeup goes on it
better and so that's what i'm going to
use this as and if i really find this to
work i think i might just purchase the
full size and just continue it be
cuz it's something that I feel kind of
self-conscious about and I'd rather just
have it look nice and feel nice and be
moisturized then have it cracked and not
have this and the last sample that I
picked was the foaming milk cleanser
from ole henriksen and this is the
empower foaming milk cleanser so I'm
just going to use this and try it this
isn't something that I would purchase
probably though so I'm just going to use
it one night to clean my face when I'm
washing my makeup off maybe tonight
that's my really short Sephora haul I
hope you guys enjoyed this I don't know
how many halls I'm gonna have in this
next year I'm really just again making
sure that I just love my purchases and I
think everyone really in this community
is like that there's gonna be some
things I'm going to want just cuz i love
makeup but i want to make sure that if i
do that it's not that i did it every
time and I did it a couple times or
whatever so anyway I hope that you're
having a wonderful day I hope you
enjoyed this hall and I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
