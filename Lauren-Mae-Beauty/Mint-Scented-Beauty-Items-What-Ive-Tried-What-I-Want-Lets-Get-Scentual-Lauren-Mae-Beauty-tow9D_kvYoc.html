Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be continuing on my
scent series my first video to kind of
kick this series off was on coconut
because I freaking love coconut so much
so many of you guys in the comments also
launched coconut so it was just like
this great bonding experience I'm gonna
leave that video link down below if you
want to check it out and you missed it
and today we're gonna be going into mint
the scent of mint so how I kind of
structure these videos is I want to show
you guys things that I have or I've
tried that fall into that category and
then things that I want to try that are
on my wish list things that are
intriguing me that I haven't tried and
I'd love to hear what you guys think
down in the comments if you have any
suggestions of course leave those down
below one last thing before we get into
it I did come up with a name for this
series one of you guys suggested in the
last video to do
let's get sensual and I like that one
because I think it encompasses the
passion that I have for these scents so
it's going to be let's get sensual like
since you all you know you get it you
get the pun right right alright so let's
just get into the products again there
are a ton of them I'm gonna give you
many reviews whether like it what I like
about it but these all have a mint smell
to them so let's go I honestly don't
even know where to start because
everything so random so I guess I'll
just start here with the laura mercier
items that I have these are both in the
scent tea mint citron so these have a
minty smell to them but they have this
sweet note as well you can definitely
smell the tea on it I got these not last
Christmas but I believe the Christmas
before and I love them obviously this is
like almost done and like holding on to
the last little bits of it so I would
definitely repurchase this again I'm
gonna leave everything linked down below
so you guys can check it out and then
I'm working on finishing up the body
cream actually right now the formula on
this is really really nice it sinks into
the skin really fast and again I mean
I'm here for the smell of these products
but as a body lotion and someone who
doesn't really love body lotions this
one is a really nice one it's not gonna
leave you greasy which is like my number
one criteria but if you think that this
scent at all sounds intriguing I highly
suggest somehow smelling it like whether
you go to Laura Mercier counter or
however you can get your hands on it I
don't think this was limited edition I
think it is like always scent
also known as a permanent scent but yeah
I would definitely check these out if
you were interested I think that laura
mercier has some really great perfumes I
also have a fig one and I never hear
them talked about so I highly suggest
checking out her fragrances we have
another duo to talk about these I was
sent from skinned Iceland through
octiline and these are the Glacial face
wash and this is the antidote cooling
daily lotion now when I saw this on the
website I was really intrigued I'm
really getting into skincare I've really
been into washing my face as you guys
know so I thought that this would be
nice and I thought they'd paired nicely
together
also from skinned Iceland I've never
tried anything but the eye patches so I
thought it was cool that they had other
products for skin care so I'm gonna
start off with the face wash cuz that's
how you would use it in order this
doesn't have a very strong minty flavor
it mostly smells like a really fresh
soap but it has this cooling effect to
it this isn't nearly as strong as the
lotion I'm about to talk about but it's
really nice and refreshing I think this
is a great one for in the morning
formula wise this reminds me of another
product I'm going to be talking about
but it kind of leaves you with almost
like a squeaky clean feeling you don't
feel stripped but it doesn't feel like
super moisturizes that makes sense it's
also a very creamy a product you need
the tiniest amount because this really
does lather up this feels very like
velvety once it starts lathering up so
just use a tiny amount I feel like every
time I've used this I've used too much I
definitely could use less but it's been
really nice and I've enjoyed it
especially for the mornings I feel like
that cooling feeling that it leaves the
skin really kind of wakens me up awakens
me makes me wake up and I really I
really like that about it so moving on
to the lotion though Oh
when this says it's a cooling daily
lotion my goodness it is this is a
really nice bottle it's glass I really
enjoy that it has a nice pump on it as
well I do about two pumps on my face to
cover my entire face and this is
definitely going to be for someone who
has oily skin because as much as this
feels really nice as it goes on it
definitely like sinks into the skin and
is
gone like there's a matte texture you
don't have like a glow at all it sinks
in really fast oh if you scrub your face
and then you like get out of the shower
and you put this on homie you are gonna
feel the burn this has a minty
refreshing smell to it and this you can
totally feel I especially feel it around
my nose and my cheeks area and around my
mouth that's where the cooling sensation
is the strongest like I said when I
scrub my face and use this it was
definitely more intense if I'm just like
washing my face normally and not
scrubbing it it's still intense but not
nearly as intense if you are sensitive
to stuff like that you will not like
this I'm telling you it is I thought I
think this is pretty intense definitely
gonna wake you up like yeah Europe
you're ready to go it definitely has
like this like menthol cooling sensation
to it it says that you can bring it down
the neck as well which I've done and
again you just you just feel this
overall like a burning cooling sensation
it's kind of like that in-between
feeling I've been enjoying it but it's
definitely not gonna be for everyone and
again if you have dry skin this is going
to not be enough moisture for you so I
think you should pass on it if this
sounds intriguing
I would like maybe do a little research
and try it out but it is pretty intense
it's like a definitely interesting
product it just happen to be perfect for
this video because I knew I wanted to do
this next and I was like holy crap this
is mint next we'll stick to skincare
this is something that I picked up at
t.j.maxx and it's from pearl essence and
it's the mint and bamboo tonic water
this is something I just spray on either
after I take my makeup off before I put
moisturizer on or after I get out of the
shower before I put moisturizer on I
really do like this the spray on this is
really nice it definitely smells like
mint
I can smell like some other scent which
I'm assuming is the bamboo it does
almost have like a cinnamon scent to me
though like I know it's not supposed to
but like I think the way the two scents
mix it has like this underlying like red
hot scent to me I've been enjoying it
though obviously I've used quite a bit
of it I believe I paid $5.99 for it and
I think that's a fair price I did enjoy
it and am enjoying it so I've used a
pearl essence tonic water up before I
think they're really great let's talk
about a hair product this is from Nioxin
we have the number three fine hair
shampoo we do have the conditioner but
we use that one up currently this smells
like mint and the reason that it has
like that minty tingling sensation is
because this is a shampoo that's going
to help with hair growth and promote
hair growth you want that mint and that
tingling sensation to kind of I guess
like activate the scalp and get the
blood circulating and you know hopefully
get those follicles to start growing
personally I don't think that I can give
you any like definitive proof that this
is like helping me or helping Sam I
don't use this all the time Sam as the
one who uses it more than me I do love
that refreshing feeling on the scalp
though like it does feel nice I believe
the conditioner is the one you kind of
like leave on the scalp and you're
definitely feeling this tingling
sensation on your scalp you feel the
blood kind of pumping on your your brain
and yeah I think that honestly not
enough people talk about hair loss in
women I know we know like as men get
older they lose their hair but I think
that a lot of women struggle with hair
loss and so if you do I think you should
try Nioxin or try Bosley I believe
Bosley it's the other one just try
there's Karen eek
I think but if that is something I think
you should try something topically and
see if that can help at least it's
preventative anyway if you're struggling
with that I just don't think it gets
talked about enough and it's kind of
like this tabata thing but like girl I
can already see my hairline receding and
I already have really thin hair so I'm
expecting to be bald by the time I'm 35
I think we're doing okay hopefully on
time next I want to talk about the
origins checks-and-balances facial wash
I did mention this briefly but this is
so great it has a minty scent it feels
so good on the skin again that tingly
sensation I'm gonna say that with a lot
of them ooh I really love the mint smell
on this I have gotten many samples of
this I've purchased the full-size I've
since used that up and now I have too
many so this is my backup mini I'm using
a mini now I really really do love it I
have a lot of different face cleansers
to go through at the moment but this is
one that I can see myself repurchasing
into the future one that I recommend
again it leaves your face really like
squeaky clean so if you don't like that
feeling you might not like this but I
really
joy this Sam really likes it if you're
someone who takes showers in the morning
because that's where I keep it it's
going to really like wake you up and I
really enjoy that about it so highly
suggest this really great cleanser I
have a hand wash here this is from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works and it's the eucalyptus
mint this one happens to be in the
foaming but I've had the regular hand
soap as well I've gone through many of
these and this is just a really nice
classic kind of like herbal e mint smell
to have in a hand soap I think this
would be great for the kitchen I love
lemon mint as well that's a great one
it's great in the candle this is just
like a classic Bath &amp;amp; Body Works scent
that I really enjoy so I thought I would
throw it in here I just went to Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works and Sephora I don't know do
you guys want to see another haul I have
enough stuff that I definitely could do
one it's all things I've purchased so
yeah let me know if you want to see that
I think I want to show you guys what I
bought at the Sephora vib sale it's only
a couple items and then maybe I'll tack
on the other things let me know what you
think in the comments I know I've been
hauling a lot I don't know what's going
on that's why I'm doing my project
payment video tomorrow the next item I
have here is just an essential oil this
one happens to be from Young Living my
mom gave this to me I'm not I think they
might be like a thing where you sign up
I'm not really sure but she left this at
my house quite a while ago and this is
in the spearmint scent but you can get
essential oils all over the place they
have them at t.j.maxx they have them
everywhere and this one's really really
nice ooh spearmint is one of my
favorites we get the Costco pack of the
extra gum and spearmint so we always are
like loaded on the gum we're like
passing it out like her politicians
trying to get elected I really love this
I just thought I would mention this
because I have it and it's something I
kinda want to remind myself to use more
before we got on the plane coming back
from Oregon to LA my friend Amy she like
gave us some oils to put on and stuff so
I was like I should be putting this oil
on it again just has that like calming
refreshing smell to me so I really
really like this and I thought I would
mention it and last before we get into
the lip products because I do have quite
a few of those I feel like that's a very
popular like minty item I want to talk
about a toothpaste and the toothbrush I
guess that kind of goes with it this is
from equip so I originally got this from
clip through octiline and I really
enjoyed it
I've since but Sam one I had my mom get
one she's had some one get one
everyone I know now has equip and I
really really like this one it's just
like a stylish cool toothbrush I love
that it doesn't have like a charging
system but you get the benefits of an
electronic toothbrush my mom just went
to the dentist and she was saying how
the dentist was like any electric
toothbrush is like ten million times
better than just using a regular brush
to brush with so if you were looking
into it I mean there are a ton of
different options on the market you can
do whatever I've had this for over three
months now and I really like it that
being said the mint product I want to
talk about is their mint anti cavity
toothpaste gone through a mini we've
gone through two other full sizes and I
love it so much how quick works is I'll
send you things every three months I
believe and so this is five dollars and
you can have it on renewal and get it
sent to you every three months as you
need it so I love this I just I love the
taste I'm very picky when it comes to
toothpaste and which mint ones I have so
I'm really happy that I've enjoyed this
one and it's just something I haven't
really gone away from since I started
using it and me and Sam use it together
that's why we've been through so many of
these but I know when I went back to
Arizona for Christmas I was using this
so I just had to mention that because I
truly love that mint toothpaste
I feel like this series is just like
showing you how weird I am like that's
what this is all right last let's get
into the mint lip products that I have
here we're gonna start with like the
bombs and treatments I have a lip
exfoliant here from ELF
and this is in the mint scent they have
a ton of different scents but I love
this this is a great easy to use lip
exfoliant I have the pure one in my box
determine I prefer this and this is
three dollars so this is a great
purchase a great value we can get
whatever since you want I think they
even have a coconut one if that one is
more your style but I've enjoyed the
mint I think it works well for the sugar
and it doesn't like crumble down too
fast it also doesn't hurt your lips it's
just it's perfect the next product is
from pathology and this is the lip
service gloss and balm this retails for
$15 but I did get this sent to me
through octiline I really like this this
is something I've been keeping in my
purse and just keeping on me it gives
you a glossy look to the lips but not
like overly shiny but it has that balm
like consistency so I feel like if I
look put together but I want to like
treat my lips this is what I go for it
also has like this sweet mint scent to
it so it's not like a super strong mint
but it has that tingle it kind of plumps
the lips and I really enjoy it so this
is something I do recommend and have
been enjoying something kind of similar
to that is from Clarins again I got this
through octiline this is the instant
light lip comfort oil and this is in the
scent mint I like using this more at
night this is a thinner consistency than
that patch Geology one and I just I I do
really enjoy it I love how big the
paddle is on this it's like massive this
is probably the least minty scent which
is kind of surprising since it's called
mint it's not super in-your-face it does
leave you a little bit tingly on the
lips but nothing intense nothing too
much but this one's really nice again
it's kind of like that in-between of
like a gloss and a balm so you can wear
it whenever you want to as a treatment
like when you're not like being around
other people but you could also wear it
around people and not feel like it's
just like gunky on your lips you know
what I mean so all three of those
treatment products I really enjoy and I
have two more lip products to talk about
and I'm telling you then we're gonna go
into things I want boo the first color
item here this is from Revlon and it's
the plumping lip cream I have mine and
barely blush and I love this I love this
so much it's one of my favorite lip
products at the moment I really don't
hear that many people talking about it
although I did see Emily Noelle talk
about it recently I've only tried this
color so I can't like speak to other
colors but I love the formula I love the
way this looks on the lips it feels
moisturizing but it kind of leaves this
like matte look it plumps it has like a
tingly feeling it has like a smell of
vanilla but again that minty tingle is
coming through really enjoy and highly
suggest and last we have the infamous
buxom products so you guys know my love
for the buxom full-on lipsticks is
strong Dolly's my favorite color
although I feel like they're phasing
these out because I can barely find
these on the website I don't know of
course they would discontinue my
favorite products but I do have a backup
anyway I love these these are very
creamy but they go on kind of matte they
leave a tingle and they kind of have
like a minty vanilla scent so I really
enjoyed that
and then I wanted to bring up my little
baby mini of White Russian I did have a
full-size of this at one point I've just
since had to get rid of it because it's
way too old these have that vanilla and
there is this like mint under note to it
and these kind of plump they are great
I've really been enjoying it I love this
mini like I wish I could buy minis this
small because that's honestly all I need
I really like this though and I've been
enjoying it I highly suggest it White
Russian is like a classic lip color
alright so those are some of the mint
scented beauty items in my collection
currently and some reviews now let's get
into some that I'm intrigued to try
these are things that are kind of on my
wish list I really want to start a
series of like brand specific wish lists
again I don't know what's my problem I
just like I've just been enjoying
looking at like what brands are coming
out with and so I think it'd be cool to
like talk about like in in a world of
make-believe I would get these things
from NYX and I would not get these
things from NYX or whatever the case may
be like that was kind of my premise let
me know if you want that I also want to
do like an Ulta specific wishlist
honestly I just need to like get off of
websites I think okay anyway let's get
into the items that I think look really
awesome with mint in the title or
somehow related to mint the first one is
from nest and it is the moss and mint
candle this retails for $40 so it's
really expensive I did work at stores
that sold this and it smells really
really nice that Moss gives it like this
nice earthy scent and then that mint
comes through its really really nice and
light and fresh I really I really like
that candle I would love to have it and
burn it and see how the scent throw is
next on my list are some lip balms of
course these are the skin fix lip balms
they have a whole range of mint one so
they have like a regular mint one they
have a lemon mint a coconut mint a
watermelon mint so yeah I'm like really
wanting to try them they usually retail
for five dollars but right now on Ulta
they are 350 so I kinda want to try them
out but I think they're like also
without some kind of like irritated by
that but uh everyone's like on it but
anyway all of those sound really good
I'm intrigued by the coconut mint
obviously they'll I mean all of them
sound really really nice so let me know
if you've tried them and how they are
next on my lip is a scalp oil again
because I have like really fine hair I
feel like I'm losing my hair a lot it's
from Earth's nectar and it's a mint
leaves scalp oil it retails for 20
50 I think it'd be really nice for Sam
as well not only for the stimulation
properties of that mint but because it's
an oil just to kind of like nourish the
scalp and not let it be so dry cuz he is
very very dry so that's something that's
on my list to try out oh this one sounds
so nice this is from little barn
apothecary which is something I had
never heard about until my last video
which I talked about the coconut and
mint spray which is still on the list
but this is the coffee and mint
exfoliating scrub it sounds magnificent
but it's $30 so it's kind of expensive
but it looks so nice this brand just
intrigues me I just like their aesthetic
I like the products that they have I'd
really like to try some of their stuff
too more kind of like lines I'm
interested in one is from Herbal Essence
and this is the Renu white grapefruit
and most of mint they have a dry shampoo
as well as a volumizing line and I
believe a shampoo and conditioner those
just sound really nice so I honestly use
a lot of high-end shampoos and
conditioners just because I'm lucky
enough to get them at a discount because
my mom's a hairdresser but this one
sounds really really nice so I'd love to
like smell that like if I see a grocery
store and I see that I'm gonna like
definitely get my little nose in there
the dry shampoo sounds like it would be
amazing
I feel though I have used one of the
directions and it's such so I don't know
let me know if you've tried it and what
you think I would think about that and
the last item here is from grace cole
and it's the grapefruit lime and mint
body mist not a body mist girl there are
more products in the line but this one
just sounds so refreshing and nice and
light I love that they're mixing that
citrus with the mint scent so again it's
something that's just on my list I think
it'd be so nice and refreshing for
summer and just sounds amazing
so yeah that retails for $12 so it's not
too expensive and that's my video about
mint I hope you guys enjoyed this one
again definitely leave your suggestions
for any mint related products down below
so all of us mint lovers can come
together and get some recommendations
from each other I've really been
enjoying this series it's something that
I've just had a lot of fun with so next
I'm going to be doing I don't know I
I don't do Fig next I'm still kind of
like trying to get some things I feel
like fig is so hard like I have things
on my wish list that I want but when I
think of the thick things that I've
tried it's mostly all perfumes like
that's kind of it so anyway figures on
my list but if there's a specific scent
that you want me to do let me know down
below also citrus is when I'm like
playing with as well that's everything
thank you so so much for watching guys
and I will see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
