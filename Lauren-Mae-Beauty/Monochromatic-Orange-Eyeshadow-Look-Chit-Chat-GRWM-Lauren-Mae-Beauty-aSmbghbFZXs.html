Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to do a get ready with me
and my eye look is going to be a
monochromatic like orange look I'm
really excited I did do something
similar to this in a previous video but
I was wearing glasses so you couldn't
really see it and I thought I would kind
of just pump that look up do it again I
just I don't know wearing all orange
it's something kind of fun and I've been
straying away from the oranges a bit
lately and I think it'll be fun so let's
do a few skincare things I do have my
brows on I'm gonna be putting on this
Clarins mission perfection under eye
corrector it's like a eye cream and a
corrector all-in-one but I just I with
the winter I have had a lot of just dry
skin and so anything I can do to help
combat that under my eyes has been
desperately needed I swear to you I
don't know what is going on well I mean
I do it's winter we're gonna let that
sink in while I put on my primer again
I'm using the cookie glow you guys know
I've been using this a lot lately and
I've really been enjoying it I'm going
for a glowy look today with my orange I
just kind of basic I want this look to
be kind of fast
I don't want to be here for forever it's
not super like intensive when it comes
to technique or anything so I feel like
sometimes being monochromatic with your
eye shadow is a great way to like do
something kind of interesting but it
doesn't necessarily need to be like
super technical yeah I don't know I like
the way this feels on my skin I did it
the first time I used it which is so
funny but I do now for a kind of extra
glowy step today I'm going to be using
the one over one sheer light base glow
this is like a luminizing base I don't
know why I'm kind of nervous but I'm
just going to be putting that on
actually with my fingers I have like
swatch this so I don't know if this is
gonna be like too much glow all over the
place but we're gonna try it this is
like a more all-natural brand I think I
have a coupon code to get this sent to
me from octoly so if I have a coupon
code I'll leave it linked down below if
you're on
check it out I don't have any
affiliation with it it's just a code for
you guys to save money and I just
switched to a brush to kind of work that
in I definitely have a bit of a glow
going on I kind of like it though it's
not overly shimmery for me and what I'm
going for especially since I know I'm
putting product over this so we'll see
how things layer on it and how it wears
I went back and forth on the foundation
I wanted to use today but I am gonna go
in with my NARS radiant creamy I am
using this up in my 12 by Christmas or
12 pans of Christmas so I don't know I
mean this is a really pretty finish on
the skin I think this color just kind of
turns pink throughout the day that's
what I don't like about it every time
I've ever talked about this foundation I
feel like the coloring it's like I like
it when I put it on I'm like oh yeah
that does look good and then I feel like
when I take it off in like what the heck
my foundation color was like way off so
I don't know what that's about I want a
really just like light dewy look today
and I mean it this time and I told I
feel like so many times I'm like light
and glowy and then I do a lot of makeup
I think but um I really do want the skin
to show through I just kind of want to
be a little bit more perfected but not
perfect a few things I want to talk
about so I am going away for the
Thanksgiving holiday I had a shoot that
got pushed back I was gonna do a short
film from the like 17th to the 19th and
so we were gonna like leave a little bit
after that and go home to Arizona for
Thanksgiving but since I got pushed back
we're actually gonna go a little bit
earlier one of our friends is having a
party and we're gonna actually be able
to make that so that's kind of exciting
and yeah we're gonna be there like a
whole week so that kind of puts a wrench
in my plans
I feel like it's as soon as I say I want
to daily upload hits the fan and
I'm not able to but if I never said
that I would definitely be able to so
anyway I'm going to try to film a ton of
videos today and at least have them so I
can upload them and like edit them while
I'm there I have a feeling though that
we're gonna most likely go to like every
other day uploads for a little bit
during November just because I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to film there
I don't want to put pressure on myself
too much to film there and I wasn't
expecting to leave and I just have a lot
of things to do and get ready I've been
on set a lot this week I did a music
video on Monday which I did film some
behind the scenes stuff so as soon as
that music video comes out I might do
like the tiniest bit of like an intro
and like a little bit behind the scenes
footage and then just kind of like show
you tiny clip of that and have you guys
go see that music video because I'm
really excited to see what that looks
like and then I also did a gig with Taos
Footwear I don't know if you guys know
about them they do like comfortable
sandals but that's really fine if you
guys follow me on Instagram I have
posted about some of the stuff I tried
to I don't know I've been uh I've been a
little like distant from Instagram
lately just because I don't want to like
I don't know sometimes I get weird are
you guys like that like if I post
everyday I feel fine and then as soon as
I have a couple days away I feel weird
to like get back into reposting a ton
anyway it's weird for me keeping with
glowy and moisturizing I'm going in with
the Eden minerals click pen concealer
and I this gives just a little bit of
coverage not too too much and it's quite
brightening so I'm just going to put the
tiniest bit of that I know it doesn't
look like a tiny amount and I don't have
my sponge with me which is what I would
normally use so I'm just going to kind
of like tap that in off the brush and
then I'll probably tap it in with my
finger um but yeah I just wanted to give
you guys an update and like kind of
heads up me and say we're planning to
maybe go to the Grand Canyon or do a day
trip to like Antelope Canyon or is that
what it's called I don't know whatever
the like really cool Instagram place is
just to like have a moment to ourselves
I feel like sometimes when we go back
for holidays it's like you know it looks
like a vacation because it's like we're
out of town for a whole week but
sometimes it doesn't really feel like a
vacation
as we're driving here driving there
trying to see everyone while we're
thinner which you know of course we want
to but it can just be kind of taxing so
I think it'd be kind of fun to have a
day trip just us to get away see
something fun explore nature get up
early and I'll get there really really
early which won't be better early
because it's kind of a far drive from
Phoenix but yeah that's something we're
gonna be doing and I probably gonna vlog
it's what I'm thinking I don't know I
always say I'm gonna vlog and then I
have like two things of footage I can
put to some music but that's something I
was thinking about as well so I'm gonna
tried my best to get videos up while I'm
gone I'm probably gonna be doing every
other day though I just think I can more
consistently actually do that and I'd
rather do that than like upload for
videos in a row and then not have
content for four days I'd rather have
content for eight days every other day
you know that's it for my face I really
think it looks nice and natural I'll
fill in this for under the eyes to set
my face I'm using my translucent powder
something else I wanted to mention I
know a lot of you guys are new both
Kaylee and Jen loves reviews shouted me
out which is so amazing if you guys
don't know about their channels you
should so I'm gonna leave the link down
below go check them out but they both
did just such sweet videos and it was so
it's always so like shocking and and
just like weird in a good way when
someone mentions your channel and talks
about you and you're just like what the
heck it's like I don't know it's just
such a strange feeling I felt so just
happy and grateful and honored to be
mentioned in those videos and yeah I
don't know it's so exciting so if you're
from their channels and you come and
subscribe to mine thank you so much I
hope you enjoy the channel I hope you
enjoy my content yeah tip 9 hope so I am
excited for the different videos that I
want to film today we'll see if I have
the chance to because Sam's coming home
and he's doing a scene with someone from
his acting class and I still need to
clean this place
it looks disgusting it's not that bad
actually I've been doing a really good
job of keeping the house up but you know
I like to make it look as good as
possible but I'm doing quite a few
videos I guess if you're watching this
I'll give you like a little sneak peek
into what's going to be coming up on
Lauren mate beauty before that though
for bronzer I'm gonna go in with my
Laguna and just this elf brush so today
what I want to try to film I'm I'm
hopeful I'm filming a lot stupid on the
anasazi ffs really hills prism palette
this is something that I had mentioned
in an anti haul that I was not going to
be purchasing and I thought it would be
fun to kind of stupid and someone had
asked me to dupe it on Instagram so that
is going to be coming up
I actually really happy with what I
picked for dupes yeah so that will be
coming up I also have another single
shadow video and it's going to be
inspirational quads like well they're
not even quads okay how do I explain
this they're going to be color
combinations inspired by different
things it's just supposed to give you
guys inspiration with color and to do
something different and - I don't know
enjoy what you have in your collection
so this video is going to be inspired by
fall I went on Pinterest picked a bunch
of different pictures and then created
six pan palettes that are inspired by
those colors inspired by the feelings
and I don't know then I was just musing
off the pictures you know I think that's
gonna be a really cool series I
definitely want to continue it on my
channel with other things as well
it doesn't always have to be with the
seasons or anything it just happened
that I was like you know what I'm gonna
look up some really cool fall pictures
and also do some things that are maybe a
little bit different for fall than just
like burgundy and gold not saying I
don't have any of those in these you
know what's up six pan pellet it's not a
quad it's not a Quinn it's a
fill-in-the-blank I don't know but I am
excited to show that I think it's gonna
be like a fun video I hope you guys like
it I think you will and like I said it's
just all about color inspiration and
maybe putting together some color
combinations
aren't you know your normal and being
inspired and that's what I love about
single shadows is that you can pick them
up and put them by a pink or purple or
green and be inspired in so many
different ways and create different
looks
yeah that's coming up um what else sadly
though I will say I won't have demos for
any of those looks because we're getting
ready right now and I filming them today
so um yeah I hate that I really wish I
could at least have a demo for each of
those but with my time at the moment I
just don't have the time to like take
off all this makeup and redo it and
refill them and all that so I'm sorry I
will try to do demos if I continue to do
that shadow quad thing they're not quads
shadow combo that's a better name for
blush I'm using the Tarte party you guys
have been loving this and since we're
doing a really warm look I thought a
nice like kind of nude warm blush would
look good for a highlighter I'm using a
pure nude by essence yeah I got it right
and just putting that where highlighter
goes it's a glowy look so I thought this
one I was appropriate and then other
videos I'm filming I'm gonna do a tube
talk but this one's not gonna be
necessarily super controversial I feel
like you know I want that series to be
controversial a little bit and like just
what I'm feeling so so whatever it is
I'm feeling that's what I want to film
and today though we're gonna talk about
or when you see that video we're going
to talk about makeup school and whether
you should go to makeup school or not if
you're gonna be a makeup artist I'm
gonna talk to you guys a little bit
about my makeup school my like August
opinions of everything and all that so I
thought that would be kind of good it's
been on my tube top list for a very long
time I just you know if I get really
heated about something I just feel like
I need to film that before that video
but today I thought it was like a good
time I was in a good headspace
I can't believe LAN eyes already I'm
really trying to make this a speed you
get ready with me oh that's a video I
want to film like my 10 minute face
because I like to wear makeup when I go
to gigs because you know I'm there to do
make up I don't want to show up and it
look just crazy and be like oh no I'm
the makeup expert trust me let me let me
make your face beautiful even though
mine isn't and it doesn't matter what my
call time is I want to look presentable
and good for people to trust me
especially if it's a first impression
and you haven't met anyone I'm in the
cast before anyway I thought it would be
good to do like a ten-minute face and
actually do it in ten minutes I know
that was like a challenge a while ago
but I thought it'd be cool to show you
guys like what I do
what's my actual everyday for if I'm
gonna be on set at like 7:00 or 6:00 in
the morning what I do to get rid of fast
but still it presentable I'm just gonna
set my lid with the powder so I don't
have any issues with blending I have
like a million orange shadows that we
can choose from today so I am excited to
kind of like delve into some stuff as
much as this is simple when it comes to
like the actual colors you definitely
don't need to use as many products as I
might use because I'm kind of just
wanting to use a bunch of different
things that maybe I've been neglecting
or that are new or whatever so first off
I want to go into the My Little Pony
palette and I'm gonna be taking this
shade here it's like a light peach and
I'm just gonna be kind of running that
through my crease with my Sigma e-40
brush this is just to work down some of
that orange tone in a nice light shade I
really want this pretty blown out so you
know just blend until your heart's
desire I don't really like blending
things like into the eyebrow especially
in the tail section but I might bring it
up like and touch the brow here like I
do like see for me I would already like
love this and then just like go you know
put some mascara on and I'm good there's
just something so beautiful about simple
looks to me but not today not today
we're gonna go a little more intense
than this I really like this color I've
been using this palette quite a bit I
think it's pretty nice I've been
enjoying it the color combos at first in
kind of like weird but I think you can
get a lot of you know separate
inspiration
the colors the next shadow monies is
this one from Milani and this is the
color of Bella Mandarin you could just
go in with this especially if you had a
medium skin tone you could just go
straight in with this but I just wanted
to mostly use this because I have it
yeah like I've never used this and I
makes me sad and I'm still bringing that
into the brow that didn't honestly do
too much but I do like what it did do
alright now we're going to go in and
really punch some orange in going into
the electric palette y'all and we're
gonna go into the color Slover which is
the orange right there this has a little
bit of glitter in it so I'm just making
sure to tap off and we're gonna keep
that lower than the other colors um but
I kind of want to take it the whole way
around and just blending that into the
crease I feel like these colors are
looking a little bit pink almost alright
and I'm just gonna go back in and blend
out the edges and then just to put a
little bit more depth I'm gonna go in
with the color realgar from the modern
renaissance and just put that kind of on
the outer edge alright I saw two more
shadows like I want to use for sure for
this orange look I know you definitely
don't need this many next I'm going in
with a color pop shadow this is the
color White Rabbit it was from like the
studio 1400 or something like that
collection I'm gonna be putting this all
over my lid I'm just using my fingers I
find that's how these shadows work best
although you can use a like flat shader
and that sometimes it works well as well
okay I'm liking it I'm liking it and now
we're gonna top that with yet another
shadow we're going back to the My Little
Pony and color pop palette and we're
gonna go in with this shade up here it's
like a golden orange I'm going to be
putting that on with a flat shader brush
and then I'm going to be spraying it
though with a setting spray this one's
from Saturdays and the daily do mist and
I'm going to really pack that on
so hopefully we get something really
opaque really metallic to go over that
base we laid down yeah I like that I
think that added some of the dimension
that we needed
I feel like this look also like at any
point you could have stopped and I think
it would have looked really good I
really like how this shadow is
performing and then just to kind of
deepen up the edges again I'm going back
in with realgar I'm just going to make
it have a better fade on that outer edge
for an inner corner and highlight today
I'm just gonna go back in with the
highlighter that we use something that's
just kind of neutral it's not going to
be too much on the everyday I mostly
used my highlighter as my inner corner
highlight as well I'm not gonna do
anything too crazy when it comes to
liner I'm literally just gonna line my
waterline with a white liner just so
that the orange isn't mistaken for any
pink in my waterline and it'll just keep
the look nice and light and bright for
under the eye I'm gonna go in with that
first shade that we use from the My
Little Pony palette and just kind of
sweep that underneath I think I'm just
gonna leave it kind of like lighter and
blown out under here as opposed to like
really making it super orange with all
the shadows we used on the top mimicking
them on the bottom last for the eyes I'm
gonna go in with a mascara this is the
number seven lash impact ultra mascara
and I'm going to coat my lashes quite
heavily since I'm not going to be tight
lining
I haven't been tight lining as much as I
used to lately
there's just something I don't know I
just don't want to put the gunk on my
eyes and mostly but I also have been
enjoying the look without it also I was
just realizing I forgot to mention the
last video that I'm going to film today
because I'm gonna film five technically
or that's the goal anyway I want to film
a Black Friday like shopping resistance
like video don't you can watch if you're
feeling like you're gonna buy stuff and
you don't want to just a video for if
you need some reassurance to not buy
things or you don't want to get caught
up in the hype of
everyone else buying around you I
thought I would make a video like that
because I am not really gonna Black
Friday shop I don't think like not
really I don't well one I don't have a
ton of money to just do that anyway so
that's like already immediately stopping
me but I just don't have the need to
really look and I feel like well I'll
talk about it in that video actually who
I'm being so such a cheese right so
that's the eyes kind of simple they
still look kind of like I don't know
like bright or young or something I
don't know I really like the way they're
looking last we have lips and I'm doing
something kind of simple for that as
well I have another product from one
over one that I'm going to be trying out
this is like a lip oil with a bit of
like a shimmery color in it it's just
just like a lip oil that has a shimmery
like white in it so I thought I would
try it out I have used it once when I
first got it not sure how I feel so I'm
first lining my lips and talking as I do
just so that I have a base of color down
for this to go on top of now that
happened on we're going in with this
it's just like a squeeze tube it reminds
me of like Jane Iredale packaging
honestly um oh yeah well so this has
like a floral situation to it and that
is the thing that throws me off the most
it's not and it's just such a runny
product for this packaging it was like a
piece of my skin that literally felt
like glass it was so like sharp alright
I'll keep you updated on how I like this
as I use it more but that is the final
look guys I hope you enjoyed this just
kind of simple ish monochromatic orange
I am excited to film more videos for you
guys I have some good ideas I'm excited
I hope you are gonna enjoy the videos
that are gonna be coming up and I also
hope that you have a great Thanksgiving
it's not quite there yet and filming
almost like a week before that it's
Friday today but since I probably won't
have a video up and film
video before we get to Thanksgiving I
hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving
with your family or friends or whoever
you spend it with and I will see you my
next videos guys thank you so much for
