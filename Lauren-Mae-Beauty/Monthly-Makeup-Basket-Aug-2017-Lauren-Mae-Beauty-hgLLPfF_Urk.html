Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm doing kind of a new video on
my channel I've done these in the past
like maybe a couple of them early on and
I thought I would start them up again
because I have put my pan that palette
and I just want to make sure that I'm
rotating out my products in my
collection so I know what I really love
what I don't and I'm just giving
everything a fair shot of youth so this
is going to be my monthly makeup basket
these are the items that I've been using
this is my acrylic drawer side I bought
this at smooth G here in Hollywood in
California but you can get these a lot
of places they're extremely common now
so we're just going to get going and get
into this I want to start with the stuff
on the top all the stuff just doesn't
really fit into the drawers at least at
the moment so we'll just go over this
stuff first and move to the doors and
I'll show you guys what I'm going to be
using
I won't go really fast as low I'm going
to be posting these in the middle of the
month I already have so much going on in
the beginning and the end of the month
that I thought making baskets would be a
good mid month video for me so that is
what these will be posted it's kind of
cool too because they have been using
some of this stuff so I can kind of give
you a bit of a review as we're talking
about them and also show you guys what
I'm wanting to use if I haven't so it's
kind of a mixing bowl and then I will
probably switch these out at the
beginning of September because I did put
these in at the beginning of August I'm
just getting around the filming now in
the middle about hopefully that make
sense let's get into it first off here
on the very top this is the honest Anzio
subculture palette you guys have all
seen this from a million videos but I am
trying this out and seeing what my
thoughts are on it the other bigger
palette I decided I wanted in here was
this violet vas horn this is the Holy
Grail palette so there's just a lot of
really pretty warm tones and Browns and
burgandy's and some oranges
and I just want to get more use out of
it I also have this kiss powder this is
the pro touch setting powder and it's a
translucent powder this was in my
favorites video I've really been
enjoying translucent powder especially
to set under the eye and on my t-zone so
this is the one I've been using for that
I have a melt makeup bronzer stick this
is any color based which is the lightest
of the two I really do like this product
I've been using
quite a bit it's beautiful on our skin
so I just want to continue to get some
good use out of that and their last on
the top care this is a primer from hard
candy in the sheer envy shine free
version it's almost done so that's why I
have it in here I want to finish it out
I love this primer though I would
definitely repurchase all right now
let's get into the doors I'm going to
pull out the door and we'll just take a
look at that individually hopefully the
angles not too freaky this is my top
door so I like to keep like face
products in there I kind of organized my
drawers in the way I was like to use
them so the first thing this is my
vivillon compact it's the cream compact
and medium light and I have this in a
project pan I will leave my 13 the
Halloween down below
I'm giving me a little bit of a sneak
peek but this is the foundation or one
of the foundations that I'm trying to
use up so I do have this in there the
other foundation that I'm kind of using
and tend to use a lot is this one from
NARS this is a cream compact and yeah
this is in the color of Mont Blanc and I
really like that as well this was just a
bit creamier it just has a different
formula but I like them both the other
primer that I'm working on is this
Smashbox one this is the photo finish
for minimizing it's just those small
size it's also almost done and I have
this in my projects as well just trying
to use it up this is just a sample from
it cosmetics it's the bye bye redness I
have that in a project pan a lot of this
is red aprox pans would help it's not
too repetitive I feel like when we get
into other products I try to have a bit
more variety but on are not will see
next is a pure product this is d it
pressed for and one powder - powder
foundation I really like it but again
it's so close can't wait to use this guy
up and just you know have another empty
and then last year is a concealer from
Maybelline this is the master conceal
and again in a project so close to being
done with that I have a lot of products
on the birch so I'm trying to use this
make a basket as a better way of
focusing in on things I used to use
yours all the time and then I just kind
of got out of it and then I would just
go into my big doors every day when I'm
getting ready so I would switch around a
lot which is fun but I just have so many
things that are on the blink and I want
them
so I think this will hopefully help me
do that next is a sign drawer this is a
blush at bronzer highlight so first off
for bronzer I have this Milani baked
bronzer and I am doing really great on
that I've made a lot of progress well I
just want to continue to make progress
on that guy I only have one single blush
in here this is the benefit rocket or I
am working on this in a year-long
project but I really just liked it for
everyday I don't have to think about it
it smells good I just I've really been
enjoying this blush I think it's a great
everyday one and just a simple go-to and
then the last little single item in here
is this laura geller
french vanilla baked highlighter that's
what's called I am so close being done
once again and I just want to focus on
it after Palace I have the ultimate
palette by Kat Von D I really like this
palette and it's been really fun to play
around with so I have that in here I use
this on my eyes and my cheeks and just
anywhere I want to another fun thing I
pulled out and decided to try out is
this before and Pantone universe blush
and highlighting palette this just has
three products in it but this is one
marsala with the color of the year has
cleared really pretty blushes and in a
really beautiful highlight so I just
wanted to get some more use out of this
product I feel like I kind of let it sit
in the back and although I love it and
don't want to get rid of it
I just doesn't get used so hopefully I
can get some great use out of that and
then last in here this is something I've
really been liking this is the kids halo
strobing powered and this is also in my
favorites video but it has three
different colors all three of these
highlighters work on my skintone I
really love the middle one but it's nice
to play around and I've really been into
highlight more than normal lately which
is very very surprising let me tell you
next is my eyeshadow drawer so these are
going to be eyeshadows that are
different than the palette I already
showed you I don't have this to fold
because I really do want to actually use
everything in here and not be so
overwhelmed by options that's the whole
reason that I'm doing this mega Pascal
so I just have four kind of little
options so first off I have this
Smashbox little palette these were all
the rage and then you never hear about
them right I feel like this palette is a
great example of that
they were everywhere because I got sent
out and there's so many of them
I never really hear anyone talk about it
but anyway this is the ablaze one and I
do really like it it's not like at all
in one palette to me because it doesn't
have a light matte cream shade this is
just not light enough for my skin tone
to set the whole lid but other than that
it's just super pretty and I don't want
to forget about this in my collection I
really do like it
and I like the quality and everything so
I want to keep this out and be using it
and I have done a couple looks with this
color and I did really like them next in
a drugstore little quad this is from
Physicians Formula and this is the
classic news all matte palette
these are talked about sometimes but not
too much but I just love them I think
the quality is amazing if you're looking
for some different decent maps from the
drugstore this is a great one have a
nice matte same shade I really love this
warm transition and then it has two
different variations of cool ones a
little darker ones a little lighter it's
just perfect for everyday it's perfect
to pair with something that's really
shimmery I've been using this all month
and even a little bit into July and I
truly truly like it too I highly suggest
that palette and I'm getting back into
it I really want to hit pan at least on
one of the shades and just kind of see
some more use in this because this is an
older item in my collection another old
item this is the Too Faced let's see
natural beauty collection it has two
eyeshadows and a bronzer I don't know
what it is about this palette but I just
could not get rid of it I just can't and
it's just so pretty and I just never use
it out anyway even though it is so I've
been you notice on the eyes and it's so
pretty I feel just simple it looks good
when I look in the mirror like oh yeah
that's pretty so basically I put this in
here so that I can get more use out of
it because I just won't get rid of it
but then I never use it so I wanted to
at least have some good experience with
it and I've really been enjoying it all
units bronzer the transition is on the
lid this in the outer corner and it's
just a simple easy look I really like it
and then laughs it just steel.if kitten
I've had this single for a long time and
I do love steel with kitten and everyone
does but I kind of wanted to see how
this compared now that I've had time
away from it that I tried other things
where does it stand in my collection so
I have not used that yet I also have
kind of been think it out because the
color in here is very similar to this
but I do want to kind of use that a
couple times and really see if it's
something that stands up to what
else is in my collection or throwdown
this is going to be all of my I set
beside shadows to like liners primers
eyebrows mascaras and then I have a
couple tools as well for mascara this is
the monster big from Lancome I just get
this from op delay I do really like it
I've been trying it out and I think it's
a pretty damn good mascara so I've been
highly highly surprised with that one
and been enjoying it next I have this
mini Urban Decay perversion which I
really enjoy as well - one of my
favorite mascaras and I feel like those
are kind of comparable when it comes to
brushes I really like a natural bristle
dwande that is kind of like crazy and
chaotic so that way it can separate
lashes but also give some nice coating
it's not like a normal spiral anyway
enough of that I do have two liners in
here one just my steal a white liner I'm
just working on that trying to get
through it and then the other one is my
urban decay one in 1999 again just
trying to work through those I have this
master primed by Maybelline this is the
eye primer I've been using for a long
time now I do really enjoy it it's not
my favorite but I think it works well it
keeps my eyes from creasing which is my
biggest issue with my eyes so I can't
complain this for brows it's my favorite
trio this is the sourcils styler from
Lancome this is a brow gel in the color
blonde I love this it looks great in the
brows I love the way it pushes up and
brushes at my brows I've been selling
that style and I love it next is this
elf brow pencil I'm sure guys haven't
heard about that before in my channel
and then last year this is the
colour-pop brow pencil and joke - it's
nice and thin which is something I
really enjoyed for the tail of my brow
and so yeah
in combination always work really well I
have two different sharpener options and
then this is just like a little facial
razor I don't know how much I've talked
about this on my channel but I do shave
my face I'm a hairy girl I have a lot of
peach fuzz and I really like the way
that foundation and powders sit on my
face when I don't have a ton of hair on
it and it just makes me feel less
self-conscious so I love doing it don't
be ashamed if you also shave your face
because girl who cares and last year
this is lip drawer I know it's really
bare I just don't want too much in here
we want to focus on some of these items
so on the top I have two buxom full-on
lipsticks I have before our Sydney here
and this is something that I really do
want to use that by the end of the year
I've had this a long time it's getting
really really old but I love this
formula lipstick you guys know that and
the color is nice so we don't want much
left I just want to use it up so I'm
hoping to motivate myself by keeping it
in here this is the color San Francisco
which is one I just bought from Sephora
and I like using them together because
sometimes Sydney can be a little bit too
late for me I don't like something too
light on my lips and I can kind of use
this on the outer perimeters to just
make it look a little bit more full and
plump and not as dead and slushing I
also have NARS for cooking because I am
working on that in a project plus it's
just a great everyday lip color I really
do like that color and that formula of
pencil and then last is just a two lip
balm so this is the sugar rose a fresh
lip balm
I love the fresh lip balms there it's my
favorite normal lip balm I love the
smell of that lemon I don't have much
left in it and this is a nice one if you
just don't want too much but you need
something to kind of liven up your face
I do really like this and I just want to
get it gone because it is kind of old
and last is the Revlon kiss in the
coconut tropical coconut scent I haven't
used this in a long time and I know I
talked about it it's part of my channel
and I put it on right now it's so good I
love it so I just want to get more use
out of that and not forget about it in
my collection alright guys that is
everything thank you so much for
watching please let me know if you will
enjoy this series on my channel
I can't wait to kind of switch it up and
come back with some new things in here
and just get more use out of my
collection and that's everything thank
you so much for watching guys I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
