Lauren thank you so much for watching
and this is going to be my makeup basket
for September I am a bit late on this I
like to upload these in the middle of
the month to kind of show you guys what
I have been using what I'm going to be
using plus I just have a lot of stuff
that I upload at the beginning of the
month so it just kind of works out that
way
but this video is quite a bit late so
we're just going to get into it this
acrylic container comes from Muji I will
have it linked and I will have all the
products i talked about linked as well
I'm just gonna go drawer by drawer and
show you guys what I've been using since
it is later in the month most of this
stuff I have like opinions on so I'll
share those with you and let's get to it
I guess first really fast to get this
out of the way this is the kiss
professional Pro touch makeup setting
spray I have been using this a lot
lately I'm sure you've been seeing that
in my get ready with me and different
tutorials and stuff so I'm just
continuing to use this I do like this
product is it the best setting spray
definitely not I kind of want to try
something that's a little bit more in
the middle like not super dewy but not
super mattifying and this one is more
mattifying I'm just kind of getting more
use out of that and using it up this is
the Revlon nearly naked powder this is a
my finish 13 by Halloween so this is the
only powder I have left from that
project so it is the one that I've
really been focusing on and using I have
my vivillon cream foundation here and I
haven't actually used this this much at
all this month I'm working on it I have
it in here though in case I get the urge
to reach for it it's close by I have my
Smashbox pore filling primer here I have
not used a C there I will probably end
up decluttering that too don't be
surprised if you see that it's a clutter
video soon this is one of my favorite
concealers at the moment it is the
Milani retouch and erase and I believe I
have the shade at fair I just like the
consistency of this I like the coverage
it gives it's just like a medium and
it's not too drying so highly recommend
that I do have two stick foundations I'm
gonna put through the name of this but
it's the Lancome tint idol ultra wear
makeup foundation stick I really really
like this it doesn't have SPF in it it's
a little bit light for me
moment and it's pretty cool toned but I
do really really like that and so I've
been mixing it with my hourglass
foundation stick this one I also really
really like but this one's a little bit
yellow for me so I've been mixing those
together and it's a really pretty finish
it's pretty full coverage but it looks
really nice on the skin I have two more
primers here this is the cover FX
blurring primer just a sample size but I
have been enjoying that and then this is
the YSL Touche Club blur primer I have
really really been loving that primer
lately which is super weird since I did
not originally like that and then last
this is the Eden minerals like pen
concealer I have this in my finished 13
by Halloween project as well so I'm just
trying to move through this product all
right this next drawer is what I use for
face products that aren't like
foundation so I have a couple
highlighters that have been trying to
use this month to figure out if I like
them still and whatnot so this one is
from philosophy it's the amazing grace
highlighter this is very old and I was
thinking like putting it in here to try
to get rid of it but I still really do
like it
it's nice and pink and it's still really
subtle which is what I like in a
highlighter so I will be keeping that
and I have been liking it a new
highlighter to me this one is from
Lancome and it is the dual finish
highlighter in shimmering buff this one
is really really pretty I was really
surprised actually for house shimmery
this product is but I do really like it
so I have been testing that out and I've
been enjoying it this is an eyeshadow
that I've been using as a highlighter
again it's in my finish 13 by Halloween
and I am so close so I've just been
using that on days when I haven't been
testing out anything new or you know
when I'm okay with just kind of doing
something basic and I do really like it
on the highlight
I have two of the kiss face palettes in
here this is the halo strobing palette
in light I talked about this in my fall
feels video and I've been using it a ton
this month especially the white shade
I've been having pretty heavy
highlighter on my face lately and I've
really been enjoying it with this
palette and then this one is the almond
bright radiance palette and I do like
this as well the bronzer the blush and
the highlighter all work for me so I
just wanted to get some more use out of
it and have it in here easy to reach for
I only have two blushes in here this
first one is from Clinique and it is the
Clinique cheek pop in the color plum pop
I wore this recently in my last set of
videos where I have like the pink on my
nose and quite a bit on my cheeks I even
have some of my forehead in my chin I
really wanted like a flushed look and I
use this color to get that I really do
like this formula of blushes and that
color is really unique to my collection
and then this is in here last time but
this is the rocket or blush from benefit
and I'm just trying to hit pan on this
for the year so that's why I keep it in
here I do use it probably a good like
third of the month usually so I just
keep that one in here so it's easy to
reach for okay moving on to the next
door this is where I keep my eyeshadows
that I'm gonna be testing out if B
pallets fit in here and the ones that I
was really focusing on or wanting to try
out again this month did so it worked
out first though this is a single shadow
from Milani and I just haven't really
used this since I got it from Heather
and I love it I think it's so pretty I
don't want to like just straight up to
clutter it or anything but I just
haven't gotten use out of it so I put it
in here to use it still haven't used it
so that's on my list it's been kind of
hard because a lot of the items that I
picked to put in this makeup basket were
while I was waiting for some things to
get shipped from me you guys know I just
hauled a few things so those new things
are now here and so if I didn't use
these before they got here it's like I
want to test this things out and trying
to get videos for you guys so I do want
to continue to try to use this but it
probably won't get any love for a little
bit I did use this one though quite a
bit this is the tamanna' palette from
Anastasia and I think this is such a
nice palette I know Stephanie from the
daisy girly like pam does this
and I I don't know I was looking at my
collection and really now things are
just starting to get a little bit older
in my collection and even though I like
this and I like the colors it's getting
old and I just wanted to make sure it
was something that I still actually
liked so I put it in this makeup basket
and I do I think it's so pretty bangle
is so pretty I love using it all over
the lid into the crease like it's a one
shadow look for me I love that there's a
matte cream in here it's just it's just
such a nice mix of colors and neutrals
and warms cool colors like there is just
so much going on in here I also really
love the shade gilded I like putting
this on my eyelid with bangle in the
crease it's just a really pretty smoky
eye so I have really been enjoying this
and I will continue to use this and I
will be keeping it instead of getting
rid of it but that is not the case with
the Kat Von D Lady Bird palette I don't
know why I wanted this about when I
first wanted it but I did and I just
don't like it guys I don't like the
colors in here I tried using it this
month and it just wasn't working for me
I use some of these lighter shades but
this isn't even light enough to really
put on my lid and like set my face it's
not as bright as I usually like this
shade just these didn't even really
blend out well and I don't know if
that's because the formula has just
gotten so much better or if this is
because these are old but it's just not
doing it for me so I will be
decluttering this you will see this in a
future declutter
I'm glad I gave it the opportunity in
this makeup basket and that's one of the
ways I use my makeup baskets to pull up
products that haven't used it a long
time to see if there's something I'm
actually still loving because I find
that when I actually try to make myself
used up that I for some reason have an
attachment to and can't get rid of
through just straight up to cluttering
and if I don't use it or if I do use it
and don't like the way my makeup turns
out I usually can get rid of those items
so yeah that one's going and I think I'm
gonna have to take a deeper look at my
Kat Von D monarch palette as well as the
interstellar palette because I've kept
both of those and again they're getting
older discontinued and I've really never
used them too much especially in
comparison with so many other palettes
in my collection so yeah I guess that's
a little in the future thing
this is my eyebrows eyeliners and
mascaras and eyeshadow primer so I have
a lot of the same things in here because
I tend to not switch these items up to
too much this is the Lancome monster big
mascara I really like that I have been
taking a bit of a step back because I
just love my perversion like if I could
choose anything I always choose this to
use and then the other mascara I've been
trying out is this one from ciate and
it's the Wonder wand mascara I got sent
this in an influence or a box box so
I've just been testing that one out as
well those are the three that have kind
of been rotating around for brows
there's a million products in here I am
throwing a couple things in from that
haul video this is the color pop new
brow pencil in blonde I have been using
that quite a bit
Irie found my old brow pencil from
colour-pop in dope taupe and I've been
using that of course I've been using my
ELF brow pencil and then when it comes
to brow gels I've been switching it up
this one is from Maybelline it's the
brow precise I really do like this the
wand on it is definitely a bit different
it's kind of strange but I do really
like it it doesn't deposit too much
product which is what I really like and
then I've also been trying out this
black of clear brow gel someone actually
left a comment in one of my videos
saying do you know about like the
history of black up and that they have
like a shady past and I didn't know
anything about that I got this from octa
Lee and I've only tried one other
product which was a liner and I didn't
like it and that was also from octa Lee
so I've done a little bit of research
and it seems pretty crappy but I really
would like to do a little bit more so if
you know a little bit about it let me
know down in the comments anyway I just
thought I'd bring that up because I was
doing a little bit of research on it and
stuff I've never bought anything I've
seen their stuff though at Nigel's and I
do think they have some really pretty
products especially for people of color
but if all the things I've read about
are true that is pretty crappy and I
definitely think you should look into
that before you buy their products and
decide what you want to do anyway moving
on this is the eye primer from
Maybelline in the master prime it's just
what I've been using for like ever now I
have a glitter liner in here this is
from hard candy and it's in the color
white night it's glittery and fun but
honestly it's pretty crappy so I don't
suggest it but I have been using it
anyway I think that I'm gonna just like
bite the bullet and get the urban decay
ones because I just love those they've
just been out of stock every time I want
to buy them or I'm making an order so I
haven't picked them up but yeah just
want to mention that don't buy that off
of my recommendation
let's you're brave I have a liner here
from laura geller this is in the color
brown sugar and I believe it's
discontinued I'm just using that up in
my 13 by Halloween and I have my white
Stila liner I also have this brow quad
this is from starlooks this is really
really old I'm mostly switched between
these two colors when I'm feeling like I
need some powder for my brows I also
have this razor to shave my face with
because I've shaved my face and then I
also have two sharpeners we are finally
onto the last drawer guide sorry if this
video took forever
I feel like my lip products don't change
a ton so I don't know how similar these
are to last time but I do have some of
the things that I featured in different
videos and whatnot so I have my three
buxom full-on lip pencils these are my
absolute favorite lipsticks I believe at
the moment like these are my favorite so
dolly specifically is my favorite color
you guys have heard me talk about that a
million times I also have the color San
Francisco which is my least favorite out
of the three and then I have the color
Sydney I also really like the NARS
pencils this one is what I'm trying to
use up in ruku Qian and then this one is
in the color let's go crazy it's like a
hot pink I have a lip liner and working
on from by Terry in Rose contour this is
a newer gloss to my collection from bare
minerals I've done a haul on this I've
done a rehaul on this it's been a
favorite so I do really like it it's in
the color sugar if you were wondering I
threw these in here to try to get some
more use out of them I have not used
them yet though of course not right this
is the color curvy and this is the color
bestie from colour-pop
and I'm going to
I'll try to use them and if I still feel
like I just can't get any good use out
of them I'm just going to pass them on I
have a lip gloss here from Eden minerals
this is the color Josephine I believe I
wore this in a video this last like a
month and I do really like this color
the formula is a little sticky not too
bad but it also smells like roses so
keep that in mind but color wise and
formula I still do like it it's a little
bit of that kind of like medium
Sheerness which is what I prefer in a
blossom I don't want anything too
pigmented and I don't want anything
that's just necessarily clear unless I
want a clear gloss so this one works out
for me I have a lip balm in here I
haven't really used this I'm probably
going to switch this out for the fresh
one soon because that one I really like
it has a little bit of color to it but I
love these lip balms just in general I
really like this peach one and I also
like the tropical coconut scent this is
a liquid lipstick from the brand kiss
it's in the color wicked forest I was
wearing this in my fall feels tagged as
well as quite a few other videos it's a
really dark green I think it's a really
cool take on the dark lip it's something
colorful but if you keep everything
pretty neutral it looks really nice and
it doesn't look too crazy and then I
have this other liquid lipstick here
from kathleenlights collaboration with
Oprah this is just getting old so I
wanted to pull it out and like try to
use it so I could at least use a couple
more times before I feel like it's time
to get rid of it but I have not used it
yet so maybe I'll try wearing that in a
video soon alright guys and that is
everything thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video I
will try to have my October one up in a
decent amount of time so you might see
it sooner rather than later but that's
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I'll see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
