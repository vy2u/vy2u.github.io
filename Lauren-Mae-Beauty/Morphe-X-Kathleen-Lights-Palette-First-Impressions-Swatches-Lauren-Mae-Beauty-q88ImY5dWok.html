Lauren I just got this in the mail and I
wanted to film a video it's actually
filming a different video and I was like
stop I'm gonna fill my first impressions
and swatch video of the kathleenlights
and morphe pallid i bought this
yesterday at 10am and it just got here
it's crazy I do live in California but I
just cannot believe how fast this came
to my house i ordered this as soon as i
could once the second launch of it was
happening at 10am i missed this the
first time and i didn't want to miss it
a second time so i was on the computer
like waiting I haven't done that in
forever I don't know if there are still
palettes available but I wanted to get
this up as soon as possible so that way
if any of you guys were still
contemplating it you guys could know my
thoughts on it obviously I have not used
this on my eyes but I will give you my
first impressions on this palette as
well as morphe I've never used anything
from morphe before it's my first thing
somethin about the price and just the
packaging just everything about the
kathleenlights collaboration just seemed
like the right time to try out some more
v stuff so this is what the box looks
like super cute I was surprised i did
anything special at all because it is
more fee and it is a little bit more
affordable utilitarian makeup artist
whatever on the back is a cute little
picture of her and this is the palette
it's really basic black cardboard with
the morphe and kathleen lights in red
metallic on the front and then inside
this is the pallid i hope it's showing
up true to color my lighting is not the
best i apologize it doesn't have a
mirror I don't really care about that
this palette costs 1499 plus you can use
a discount code to get ten percent off
so i did use that and so i think this
came out to $13 plus tax and then I do
have to pay shipping on the more few
website you do have to pay shipping
unless it's over a hundred dollars i
believe i paid eight dollars in change
for shipping and I live in California I
know that that can kind of be a bummer
but it got to me so fast so I am at
least happy that I wasn't waiting
forever for it to process and then
finally ship out like I really cannot
truly believe I'm holding this right now
so I was really drivin by the colors of
this palette I really liked this color
might be a desert sands from makeup geek
and just in general I thought this was
something a little
different a little bit more interesting
than some of the other palettes coming
out I feel like there are so many
pallets on the market right now that are
really orange and warm and this gives
you a little bit of warmth without being
just too orange and in your face and
just similar to other things out there
so I thought the price the fact that
it's morphine I haven't tried it I
wanted to support her collab everything
about it I was just like down to try
this palette so let's just get into
swatches I've just barely dunked my
finger into this and I have to tell you
that I think it's really nice I mean for
the price I mean it's really good guys
the shadows feel different than I
thought they would obviously i'm not
going to do brush swatches so if you
don't like finger swatches sorry but
that's the first one there really really
pretty if you like that light inner
corner highlight or allocate that'll be
perfect for you it is pretty white
though it doesn't have like peach or
gold undertone it's pretty just like
cool and white the next shade is a matte
and I'm really glad this is in there for
laying down your base and stuff but that
one's really nice it's not like insane
but i'm also really fair so the next
shade here this is mostly matt it does
have a little bit of like glitter in it
but nothing too chunky actually so it
mostly i think will translate as a mat
on the eye that's it I mean you cannot
what I think that's really good guys and
I don't have like a morphy code i'm not
affiliated I mean again this is my first
pallet ever buy them I'm just like more
surprised I thought the texture would be
really similar to the Coastal Scents
ones and these are a little bit heavier
especially the metallics they just feel
like they have more substance like they
don't kick up as much powder I feel like
as the Coastal Scents one so this is the
next shade it's just like a golden
that's it there this next one is almost
like a raspberry chocolate shimmery
shade that's it there that's just like
one swatch you know not really like
trying it all crazy right I mean these
are all colors so far that I feel like
we all might have in our collections but
I just I really like it when I posted my
picture on Instagram
showing you guys that I bought this
palette a lot of you guys were saying
like oh it's super good and you guys
were not lying i highly suggest this if
you were thinking about it and you know
we're kind of wanting it i would just go
for it it is limited edition and it's
not that much money if you think that
these colors are something you'll like I
think you will like this let's move on
to the next row this is a matte kind of
like gray charcoal color trying to make
sure my hands completely dry that's that
one there I feel like it's watches a
little bit less intense than what's up
there but for my own self I personally
don't mind it and as much as it might
not be as dark it's not patchy at all
next ooh this one's really pretty I'm
not usually into these kind of like topi
topi Gray's that's it there has almost
as like pin to purple to it super pretty
the next is like a true bronze shade
nothing too warm that's it on my finger
see that's it's watch there again I
haven't tried these on the eye so I
don't know how they perform on the ice
but I don't think that they're going to
perform badly by the way they feel so
I'm really liking it okay next these two
I have swatch these already so we'll see
if it happens like it did before but
these are both Matt's really pretty
colors I really like these as like
transitioned so that's the first one
it's nice and light I think you could
build it up if you want but I think it'd
be nice like in the crease or to like
kind of warm up a look and then this one
is like a couple shades down from it
also mad but when i swatched it before
they just show up so similar that's the
only thing I feel like you don't need
both of them that's like my only
complaint so far this watch is a little
bit lighter and so I find that swatch
wise it's barely different like it's not
different enough for them to both be in
this palette so other than that though
they're both still nice it's just you
don't need two of them and let's move on
to the last row this one here it almost
looks
it's going to be dual chrome but it's
just like a hunter green and it is a
shimmer metallic I'm trying to dry my
hand off I guess I'll try to do it in
front of you guys so you could see
that's it there it is kind of like a
duochrome actually a little dark for me
but it's still a nice addition the green
one here is really nice it is a little
bit more um crumbly I guess but it's
still super pigmented that's it there it
has a little bit of glitter in it but
nothing too chunky it's just I feel like
it's just less firmly press than the
other pigments that are similar to it in
the palette but I thought I was like a
really fun pop of color this reminded me
of the Jacqueline hill favorites palette
quite a bit let's move on to this next
shade this is a mat that's it sleep boom
nice like it this is a shade that I was
really wanting to try just because i do
have make a peek desert sand and i just
wanted to see how this performed
beautiful I mean for the price guys you
can't you can't beat that and then the
black I know a lot of people have issues
if the black is not like the blackest
black in history um I don't really have
as big of a deal with that that's no
primary know anything um it's not a bad
black I don't maybe with brush swatches
it wouldn't be as much but I kind of
like that in a black where you don't
just have immediately so much
pigmentation you can kind of build it up
and blend it out so as long as it blends
I mean I think that's good overall first
impressions with this watch is that you
saw like I think this is a really great
palette I'm super excited to try it I
will be filming a for looks one palette
with this so stay tuned for that if you
guys have this let me know what you guys
think of it I really think it's good if
you were looking into it and we're
wanting it I think you should go for it
I will leave a link down below if it's
not sold out already it's pretty good
guys I'm greatly impressed my first
morphe thing it gets blown up on social
media I feel like a little too much and
it's nice to know that this palette was
actually quality know there's a lot of
pallets out there that were
collaborations that maybe weren't the
best
or just had definitely some backlash but
this is really nice oh I'm so excited to
use it also this video is probably going
to go up before all these other videos
just so that way you guys can know what
I think about it as soon as possible so
yeah um I really liked it that was super
good I'm so excited to use this on the
eyes boo boo hopefully it performs just
as nicely I have a feeling it well
that's everything guys I hope you're
having a wonderful day I will see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
