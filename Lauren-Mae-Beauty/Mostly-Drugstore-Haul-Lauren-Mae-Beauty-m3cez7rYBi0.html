Lauren I was going to go measure intro
to brunch pigs but I'm just not really
up to it right now so I thought I would
just fill my haul video and then do
other videos in the future about a lot
of products laws in Arizona it's kind of
a lot of stuff I have a few things here
that are high end but most of it is drug
store I was just like on a drugstore
kids and one wild have a lot of new
products I want to do a five first
impressions of their stuff so I thought
I would just share with you guys some of
the new products that I've been testing
in my collection or that I'm going to be
you know featuring on my channel
students I'm just going to start with
the highest ever since it's not that
much the first item here is be kept on
the alchemist palette now I already do
have the moonchild palette from ah
nostalgia but I just wanted to try this
like I just love kat von d I was so
excited for this palette so I really
wanted to try it I bother right when it
came out and I sent it to my mom's
health so that way when we were on her
travels I showed up and it was there
instead of it being here and me not
being able to use it like that's how
strategic I was about this palette
overall I do like it i'm going to do a
video comparing the two not that that's
not been done yet so I'm just kind of
giving my sauce on the palate I think
the packaging is really nice it's very
interesting but I'll give more sauce on
it in a later video something else
high-end that I picked up is the Sephora
airbrush foundation and I picked this
out because I was shopping with Sam
sisters and sephora i heard a lot about
this and when one of the sisters really
likes the dior one so i was like well
this one's supposed to be exactly the
same but it is way cheaper so we all got
this each of us got one of these I got
the lightest shade which is cream I
believe let me see fair actually I don't
know how i feel about this it's kind of
weird figuring out how to use this
product I don't think it's something you
could really do a first impression on I
feel like you really do have to kind of
use it different ways and figure out
what works best to give an actual review
of the product so I'm still kind of
testing it out I don't hate it but I'm
not like in love we'll see if that
changes as I use it more I think this
might be it for the high end this is
just a point perk from that support
order for the cap on these stuff so this
is the Bravo conditioning primer from
benefit now this was
Molina well like least favorite products
of the year so I kind of understand that
just from looking at it like I just
don't feel like it's necessary but it
does feel really nicely to twist them
out and feel it on my hand I'm going to
try to use that up see what that's about
I'm glad to get like a nice deluxe I
sample to try though it's kind of fun to
try something new breaston stuff is all
drugstore so i think i'm going to try to
go in order of like purchasing maybe
we'll see this is the first thing i
purchased anything in san francisco this
is the birth bees flavor crystals lip
balm i solder it was like we need to lip
balm it's cold here and i am not sure
how i feel about this there are three
cents i believe I just did the pineapple
sent it smells honestly to me this
smells like a pineapple sense that's on
the house like obviously I haven't is
brand new but it just has like this
almost cran said to it as well and then
it i didn't know you're at can be we'll
see but it has these crystals in it that
are supposed to be like juice flavored
crystal our flavor crystals they're not
you know this has like the least amount
of flavor of any lip balm it's very
interesting the crystals to me almost
are like exfoliating which is kind of
nice but i don't know if that was their
intention with those i need to use it a
little bit more I don't like absolutely
hate it even though it sounds like I do
it just definitely wasn't what I was
expecting I think that's the biggest
thing another thing I picked up in San
Francisco was this concealer this is the
Milani retouch any race concealer I got
it in fair now if you have the
two-in-one foundation so I was thinking
about using them together in a review /
first impression type of video so I'm
probably going to hold onto this to do
that video and see how i like it i think
this was finally when we're in arizona i
think the residence is all areas on the
stuff but this is the Jordanna sculpting
go creamy contour step i have used this
one and it's a very cool time that's the
reason i got it because it just was so
cool and I was not expecting that I
think this was five dollars since i had
that hard candy one and i really just
like it i thought i would try something
else I feel like you get quite a bit of
product in there and the one time i use
it it was nice just blended out easy so
yeah I'm going to keep using that see
what I sing I went to the drugstore I
don't know why I think to pick up a
powder I'm not really sure so I picked
up a few things this is the Revlon
nearly naked
powder i picked this up because i just
felt like my skin was looking so powdery
I just wanted something a little bit
lighter a little bit different than what
I've tried in the past I'm not entirely
sure how i feel about this powder yet so
i am going to continue using it yeah i'm
not sure how i feel i love the packaging
though it's kind of big but I kind of
like that it's in white I don't know I
just like it and when I was on TV ads
rebel on with buy one get one
seventy-five percent off so I solve it
and it's one of the Revlon lip pencil I
think it's like an HD formula or
something I only like lipstick in this
kind of formula so I try to stick to
that why i buy stuff this is a really
pretty color has a little bit of shine
to it I just really liked it so this is
in the color dawn I believe HD dawn but
I've been enjoying that and glad that I
got this only kind of was in like the
stick form and how I usually like lip
products I don't know how many lipsticks
I bought and I never use because they're
just not in a format that I like and I
just need to be true my own shells man
while he was in CVS i also picked up
some maybelline things so this is any
product i saw and it is the brow precise
fiber volumizer it's supposed to be like
a brow gel but it has fibers the brush
on it it's super strange not really sure
how i like it i've been using it it's in
my brows today so but i'm just going to
keep using that see how I'd like it
definitely interesting I don't hate it
though it works better than you would
expect for that wand I feel like and if
you bought like you I products you got
something so i picked up a white
eyeliner I'm almost done if I'm the long
one and honestly I just don't suggest
this it's pigmented but it just doesn't
stay in my waterline and not my favorite
i'm going to talk the worst but i feel
like the room 01 might be a little bit
better so go with that if you can find
it I look too big lost and I saw this
Revlon set with I still little love
heart near 45 50 for all three of these
so these are all the matte formula of
the color burst bomb stains but instead
of launching their the mat bones anyway
I been wanting to try these for a long
time but I'm not going to spend ten
dollars piece on them like I'm just not
going to do it I thought 550 was a good
price for three of them so I went for it
this first one here is
the color fears it's kind of this
brownie like a brown red but mostly
brown the next color is in the color
passionate and that's is there not as
deep as you would think and then this
last shade probably the most wearable is
elusive and it's like this pinky yeah
like a pinky coral shade so I just
picked this up I couldn't resist the
deal I just mostly wanted to try the
formula and try these they have that
like minty said to them like the balm
stain so I'm happy to try these out I
would help in want a sim sisters with
buying like drugstore makeup and at the
target i was at the browsers and like
everything from physicians formula was
on sale so i decided to pick up the
bronze booster in medium to dark for 923
i thought that was pretty good they're
usually like 14 I think that's what it
looks like if you guys watched my 12
pants with Christmas you know that my
butter bronzer solver floor and broke so
I just needed a new one I like this but
I do think they like the butter browser
better so I'm probably still going to
purchase that once I like see it and
have money for it but this is working
great for now I'm just really into
something that's a little bit more sheer
and workable and buildable and just like
a really pigmented contour or bronzer
I'm just everything I would use a my
mom's house I just wasn't liking so I
was happy to pick this up now to 10 more
or less thank you this is the last
couple of products before i get into the
wet and wild stuff so these are picked
up at walgreens using number seven
beautiful matte foundations now if you
followed me for a really long time you
know that this is one of my favorite
foundations ever i'm wearing it today I
really do truly like this foundation I
use something that cool vanilla with the
lightest shade but it is actually not
then shade called calico so I didn't
know if it would be mine enough or too
late I've been having issues with like
matching my foundation for whatever
reason lately so I just decided to pick
up both of them cuz they were buy one
get one half off I love this foundation
I'm so excited to have it back of my
collection it feels so nice on the skin
it gives you a nice solid medium
coverage on first application you can
build that up if you want to be gives
you a matte finish without looking dry
at least on my skin I'm just super happy
to have this
my collection really am enjoying it and
i highly recommend it if you want to try
it out something i will realize about
that foundation as well as that it
doesn't pull two yellow or two orange or
to paint I feel like they the two colors
especially these two are very neutral so
they're kind of almost like I don't
wanna think gray but just like Daisy
they don't have too much pink they don't
have too much warmth so just kind of
just like I said neutral I don't know
I've kind of been enjoying that it's
just kind of nice not have something to
like orgies pinky weird color delhi's
for my skin tone I just wanted to
mention this while I was here I got this
at marshalls and this is just like a
little like razor let's do even get to
work this is this like a mini little
face razor i thought i was in a cute
little package i think it was like 599
my batteries like already dying but it's
probably just like a cheap one that
comes with it but I've never been
enjoying that I do like shave my face
and a very fuzzy fuzzy girl and I don't
want to live in a fuzzy world so I do
take care of that and i love it it makes
my foundation go on better I just feel
like self-conscious about it too so I've
really been enjoying that and last for
the wet and wild stuff about five
different items because again I'm going
to do these pipers depressions so of
course first I got the foundation this
is the photo focus foundation I've heard
good things bad things I picked up the
shades nude ivory hopefully it works for
me looking like a good match so far
we'll see how that works out I decided
to also pick up the concealer I believe
this is the lightest shade and it is in
the color light ivory and this kind of
looks exactly like the shade of the
foundation so I don't know how much
brightening it will do but we shall see
as I wear it this is really interesting
to me it is a liner and it is get the
skinny skinny pitch eyeliner and it's
just a beautiful liquid one though so I
think this would be really awesome I
don't wear a China liquid liner I don't
wear liner really at all I just do like
my lashes maybe a little bit of shadow
but I thought that might be a nice one
especially for the price hopefully it
works really well that would be amazing
and I just pick up to lip products
there's a ton of things in this
collection these are the things that
were they are still and I gravitated
most so this is a gel lip balm and it is
just the clear transparent one the other
shades just were too loud for me like i
just knew i wouldn't use them so i
thought i would try out this one and i
picked up a lip liner I thought this
would be really awesome it's the first
gel lip liner which I'm like I don't
think that's true but I picked up the
new to shade and this is called bear to
comment are you dare to comment I don't
know it's one of you try this out see if
they were good again if they are the
price on them is amazing so I might pick
up a couple others and that's Matt all
it smells of the stuff that I got i'm
not going to do like what i got for
Christmas haul because a lot of like
home goods and different things but
simply picked up a lot of makeup while I
was there I thought I would just show
you guys so you could see the new stuff
coming in to my collection and also let
me know if you want to see reviews or if
any of these products are interesting to
you or anything like you want to see
videos or anything like that any ideas
you have down below would be amazing but
other than that that's everything I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
