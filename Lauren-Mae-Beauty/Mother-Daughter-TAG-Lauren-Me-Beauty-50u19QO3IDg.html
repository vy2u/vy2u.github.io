I have a special guest here my mom is
here in town so I thought we would film
a video we are gonna do the
mother-daughter tag I found this on
YouTube and I found some questions so
we're just gonna
well she's gonna answer them about me so
let's see number one what what was I
like as a child
um you were just really sweet Aussie
very smart very beautiful gorgeous yes
she's very organized very creative I
love to color she coloured up the store
she loved to color yeah
puzzles another big thing they used to
do is put puzzles together and a great
swimmer she's on the swim team and yeah
we're gonna knit there where she runs
out of things to say I'm just joking
it's okay I love you
okay number two what do you think of me
making youtube videos it's very new to
me but I think it's fun I think if you
need to find out anything about anything
you just go to youtube and you can find
it and if you want to know about Beauty
you just go to Lorne may Beauty know oh
my gosh mom she has never been into
YouTube before and then now that I've
started making them she has to watch
them of course and so she's found a lot
of different channels jenna Marbles she
likes that it's surprising she also
likes Russell Brand eyes channel which
she did not like Russell Brand hated
baby now
she loves Russell Brand
would like feel like you should date him
it's ridiculous I just I do I don't know
who's laughing in the background but Sam
and my girl playing a video game in the
background so if you hear anything
that is why yeah so yeah it's just very
very interesting this YouTube stuff and
yes I've never really and Jimmy Fallon I
love why do it this is a mother-daughter
tag but I guess Jimmy Ellen found his
way into my video okay
number three what's something funny I
did when I was younger
something funny she's very serious child
oh my god I'll either make it three up
in jail or did say it or hopefully
she'll do something number four number
four have you learned anything about
makeup or beauty from me yes a lot that
there's a lot of makeup outfit that you
just can use for everything
mostly your eyebrows oh yeah yeah I
definitely couldn't out it my brows
never have I don't know where I brought
lists only years ago and now we have
eyebrows yeah bye brows she now has
eyebrows I'm spreading eyebrows
throughout the world guys okay number
five what's a weird habit of mine oh my
goodness
the mom you're irritating me also really
funny oh my gosh what's a weird habit of
mine Sam what's a weird mom is running
blanks for every question like she's not
really my mom I just met her I pulled
her out this tree habit is watching
videos and all choice to take it and
find it a different question okay if you
had to rename your daughter what would
you name her I would like to name her
but these are the first days we thought
it's Christmas the answer
she has ready to go I didn't move it
what she would have named me Felicia
which we loved and Felicia with the P
relation with enough but her last name
would not fit with it my last name
starts with a u so so we decided me more
me more they okay hmm that's that one
when you guys go out to eat what does
she order oh the same thing at every
restaurant um boys she likes Mexican
food I do I love it
and pizza if she has too much Mexican
food and Chinese food but feet I mean
Mexican food is definitely her and used
to be bean burrito chicken nuggets when
she was little if it didn't have chicken
nuggets
we really my family obviously a serious
little dictator that would have been
named Felicia yeah but Lauren's much
better our late I do like it definitely
fits her no limits the person she came
out to be okay what is one thing you
wish she would do that Lauren would do
yeah question
Oh help me call me more let's se I do
call her she does that I do okay
I'll have to work on that one um what's
something I do that annoys you
Oh sometimes she can be bossy or my
brother it's my little brother who gets
everything and it's the baby no he's
crying that's it okay and then the last
question what something I obsess over a
makeup that's true there's a reason that
I have a beauty channel yes I love baby
she loves people that's all the
questions this video was quite silly but
it was fun to make and I love my mom and
she loves me I hope you guys enjoyed
this video
um I will have normal Beauty videos
coming soon I promise
so just bear with me on that molière no
one day yeah one more day we'll get back
to regular filming um but thanks for

video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
