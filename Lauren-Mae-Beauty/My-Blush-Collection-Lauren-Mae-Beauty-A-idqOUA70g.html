is going to be the kickoff of my
collection series on my channel I
decided to do a collection series this
year on my channel because I have a
project panner I'm very into using up my
makeup and because I'm trying not to buy
as much stuff and makeup I am really
trying to focus in on my collection and
I thought what a great way to do that by
re going through my collection showing
you guys because I know a lot of people
love collection videos i love collection
videos but also getting excited myself
about my collection and rediscovering
blushes and bronzers and things in my
collection that maybe i don't give
enough love to and that i want to pull
out and start using instead of going and
buying something new and getting excited
over that this is my blush collection i
did go in depth so i hope you guys enjoy
that and definitely stay tuned if you're
wanting to see other parts of my
collection because those videos will be
coming out as we go through the year so
i hope you guys enjoy and let's get in
to my blush collection i'm going to
start with my single blushes first so i
have three blushes from Rimmel I believe
these are discontinuing now but this
first one here is called Santa Rosa that
is a swatch of it there it's a quite
light peachy color next this little one
is called plum there is a swatch of it
and last this one here is called tickle
me pink

blush from Michael Todd in the color
Lilia that's what it looks like there i
have used this one quite a bit i was
trying to finish it last year but i
didn't that's it there another one of
those really natural looking blushes i
really like the tart exposed type of
blush or a peachy blush so that's what i
have a lot of it does have sparkle in it
though this is a countless color pigment
from stila it's actually an eyeshadow
but i have it in my blush door because
that's what I prefer to use it as
swatched all together that's what it
looks like it has a really pretty Sheen
to it definitely like a good like hi
there it is definitely like a good
highlighting blush and this one's in the
color lyric this is a blush from
Maybelline in the color coral burst
that's a swatch of it there I know this
one wants limited edition this is a
blush from girl lactic in the color
Milan this is also one of my favorite
blush as I love this blush it's so soft
and so creamy I'm flipping you off and
that's a swatch of it there it's really
cool toned dusty mauve color I love this

Neapolitan lane this is probably my
all-time favorite blush ever it is so
nice that's a swatch of it there it's
that perfect just natural you don't have
to think about it color this is in my
top five as well and the other color is
in charm and it's just a classic pink
and that's it's watched underneath it I
have two blushes from Milani though they
are from different lines this first one
here is the 0 so popular luminoso and
that's its watch there it's a really
pretty peachy color and this one here is
the color romantic rose that is what it
looks like I also really love this blush

two of the two-faced perfect flush blush
this first one here is in the color
candy glow and swirled all together that
is what it looks like and the next one
is in the color peach beach and swirled
all together that is what it looks like
this is a blush I got in the Sephora in
France on the shanty lycée I don't know
how to pronounce the brand so hopefully
you guys can read that yeah I can't
pronounce it I'm so sorry i'll have it
typed down below that is what the powder
looks like you do get to pick the pan to
put in this compact so i do not know the
color of it i apologize i charge
popping it out and I can't so I'm sorry
about that but it is just like a natural
key color and that's its watch there
this is a blush by the brand baby face
and everything in the back is in Korean
so I cannot read that to you but has
this cute little puff and then that's
the color there it's really pretty lilac
and swatched on the skin that's it there
it has a really like white base so it
comes off really pastel almost like
white though it's like barely lavender I
have two of the full-size blushes from
benefit this first one here sugar bomb
and that is what it looks like swirled
all together that's a swatch of it there
it's like a really peachy shimmery color
it's on my favorite blush but i do own
it and the next one's rocket or rocket
or this is a rose gold rush this one's
really pretty i honestly have not used
it as much as I should and that's a
swatch of it they're super beautiful
Sheen to it I have three blushes from
Laura Geller these are some of my
favorite blushes that I own you guys
have all seen Bora Bora I have this in
my project pan roulette last year it's
such a beautiful color I love using this
that is it's lodged up there just has a
really pretty Sheen to it it's just a
beautiful color I love this one this
one's in the color boysenberry and
that's what it looks like it's one of
like the marble or blush and Brighton
ones and that's a swatch of that one
it's a pretty like Barry moth and last
this one's in the color sun-swept it's a
really bronzy blush color and that's a
swatch of it they're definitely a bronzy
blush we're going to some of the single
blushes that I have the most of these
are all of my clinic cheek pop flushes
so I'll go through
all five of these this first one is in
05 nude pop I love the packaging on
these and the imprint they're beautiful
that is a swatch of it they are these
give just a really nice glow to the skin
with like a slight color especially this
one is very natural the next one is
number seven Cola pop I got this because
of amber F and I need to use it more
it's beautiful it's just such a
different color and that is its watched
their this next one is in ginger pop and
this is 0-1 and that's its watched their
this is the color zero Ford plump off
and that's a swatch of it there and the
last one I have is the color 02 peach
pop
and if you can see it there that is a
swatch at the very bottom next I have
all my tart singles there are a lot of
these so we will try to get through them
this first one is in the color fantastic
and that is what it looks like this one
I am currently trying to hit pan on it's
a really pretty bright pink this next
one is in the color print that is what
it looks like
it is a second swatch there this next
one is in the color ecstatic and that's
what it looks like
sounds beautiful I really liked art
blushes I really like the colors of them
obviously I have a ton this one's in the
color entertain that one's definitely a
lighter color like less pigmented this
one's in the color classic that's it
there he's all kind of look the same
don't they know that's it's watched
there on the third one this isn't the
color epic and that's what it looks like
and thats its watched there it's
slightly deeper than the one before it
slightly this is the color mirage that
is what it looks like it's kind of more
like a pinky highlight it is a very
light blush that's it there next I have
the color magic that is what it looks
like and that's it's watched right there
this next color is in the color
embellish that's what it looks like and
that's a swatch of it and this is the
last mini one this is in the color
daydream that's what it looks like and
the bottom one is a swatch of that one
and then last first single blushes I
have two of the tart full-size blushes
this is the blush and celebrated that's
what it looks like this is a really
light blush on my skin but it's so
pretty that's what it looks like it
doesn't look like much but it's really
beautiful back glitter is from somewhere
else I don't know where that's not from
these blushes and then this one here is
the classic exposed that is what it
looks like
and that is it's lodged right below it
these look like the same color um let's
see if I can get it like a heavier
swatch see let's see that's a heavier
swatch for you guys so this one
definitely is a little deeper we're now
moving on to blush pallets i'm not going
to swatch these because it will take
forever so if you want to see swatches
of any of this stuff just let me know in
the comments and i can do that for you
this is the Beca afterglow palette this
has highlighters and blushes so these
two here are the blushes and then these
are the highlighters I keep these with
my blushes though next this is the tart
off-the-cuff holiday palette I think it
was holiday 2013 2014 I'm not sure
that's it they're there for blushes and
then this last one over here is a
bronzer this is the dull skin cheek
palette you can see my camera in the
background and that is what those look
like definitely wanting you to give more
love to I actually do have another
single blush in here sorry about that
this is the estee lauder blush in
naughty skin and and this one's quite
crazy it's a really bright red color
I'll swatch it for you guys that's its
watched out just so you guys can see
that one it reminds me of Nora's exhibit
a blush this is the Sephora and pantone
universe palette for the year that
marsala was the color of ear and that's
it there has to blush shades and then
this is the highlighting shade I also
have the blush palette from the year
before that one and this was when
radiant orchid I believe was the color
so it has the radiant orchid this is
like another blush shade and this is the
same highlighting shade that was in the
last palette I just showed you and
that's that one I love this one this is
the NARS virtual domination palette this
one has three blushes a highlighter and
a bronzer in it this is Lagoona um I
don't know all the names of blushes I
think that's orgasm think something in
here is called new order I'm not sure
those are them again if you have any
questions on any of these just let me
know in the comments I also have the
NARS guy Borden or
I don't really know how to say it um
blush palette and that's what that looks
like it has a highlighter of bronzer and
for blushes and i even have another
blush palette from NARS you can tell I
like their blush palette this is the
Steven Klein blessed palette that just
came out like more recently last year
and that's it there it has a
highlighting and contouring powder a
bronzer and for blushes this is my eve
pearl blush 300 sorry about that this is
in the color sweet cheeks light I really
like this blush trio I like to use them
all together but you can definitely get
some different looks if you wanted to
use this as a contouring type of blush i
think i'd be really pretty this is the
hourglass ambient lighting blush palette
that's what it looks like I know this
one's mood exposure this one is luminous
flush and this is incandescent Electra
these are really beautiful blushes but
something again I need to give more love
to last for blush palette I hope this is
in focus because it's quite big I mean
it takes up the entire screen this is
one of my like deposit blushes um that's
it there I'm not gonna go to into detail
if you have a question about any of
these just again let me down in the
comments but this one I believe is Estee
Lauder's I'll just say I'm geez why
don't I just actually tell you guys out
there this is a bronzer from benefit
this is benefit hoola bronzer this blush
here is sa waters peach nuance this one
is benefits corley studs and mini this
is to face Papa don't peach these are
three blushes from Playboy brand I got
this off of all cosmetics wholesale
surprisingly they're pretty good this
one's in peach bunny this one's called
between the sheets and that one is
called pink pussycat these are two
blushes from bareMinerals I do not have
the names on the back so I don't know
what they are I think they might be in
like something wish and my secret or
something I'm not sure and this is like
an ombre type of blush highlighter in
the color tuxedo plum from Estee Lauder
this
bronze are not a blush but this is sunny
bunny I believe from Too Faced and down
here this estee lauder is little
highlighter and it doesn't have a name
on it so I don't know what it's called I
got these three from all cosmetics
wholesale so that is this palette so i'm
not going to show it in any other videos
in the last blush i have to show you
