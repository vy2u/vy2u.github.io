it's gonna be my candle collection in
this video I'm gonna be showing you guys
every candle I'm gonna go individually
through which candles I have I hope this
will be enjoyable I love watching these
I actually was like on a kick watching
I'm a couple days ago so hopefully you
guys will enjoy this I am gonna split it
up between like spring candles and the
spring in summer and then my fall in
winter ones let me know if you guys have
candle collections so that I can go
check them out in the comments yeah
let's get straight into the video
this is watermelon lemonade as you can
see it's not been burned this is from
Bath and Body Works
it says clench your thirst for long
summer days with this refreshing mixture
of watermelon ice sparkling water and
freshly squeezed Meyer lemons it smells
really good it's quite sweet it's not
something I would always go for but it
does smell just like summer I'm excited
to get through this one I'm gonna say
that to every freakin candle the next
candle I have is pomelo grapefruit this
one I have started burning this is just
since I've been here in this apartment
this one's description is the ultimate
citrus lover's delight a blend of tart
grapefruit sweet pomelo and juicy orange
it's super citrusy I love this scent
it's not necessarily something I would
repurchase like backup stuff but it's
something that I do enjoy having in my
collection it's just very citrusy the
grapefruit is like the biggest thing you
smell in it I would say and it's a good
one I like this one a lot this channel
is Tuscan herbs by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is a Romek herbs from the
sun-drenched Aloia Love Tuscany inspired
this fragrance that blends fresh basil
parsley in green gardens this candle is
a very fresh smelling candle it's kind
of sweet and then at the very end it has
it like herbal e scent to it so I can
definitely smell the basil at the end
and the parsley I do enjoy this candle I
have yet to burn it as you can tell I
just don't know when to burn it and like
where but I do enjoy the scent so I
definitely will work through this it's
not something I want to get right now if
I enjoy this one or you know I want to
enjoy this one up this year for sure
the next candle I have is coconut leaves
this one smells so good mmm it's coconut
coconut and apple are my favorite type
of smelt so this one is perfect for me
it says be transported to the tropics
with this fusion of juicy tangerine and
papaya that gives way to soothing
coconut notes I've had this candle
before and I'm pretty sure I've burned
through it and this is the second one of
it I would definitely repurchase this
this is why I think they come out with
like every single summer and it's just a
great staple for me in my house I love
it I would bring this all your
honestly I just I love it so much the
next camel I have is heirloom pear this
one says enjoy a beautiful blend of
heirloom pears and apples finished with
an elegant touch of vanilla this one
just smells really fruity it's just a
nice scent I wouldn't repurchase this
one again honestly not because it
doesn't smell good just it's not like
something I just love or I'm super
passionate about so I'm definitely gonna
use it up and enjoy it but I'm not you
know I'm not gonna probably repurchase
it it's not something I would like go
into the store looking for like on a
mission so this candle is pineapple
mango now this one it smells really good
and it's just exactly what it says it
smells like pineapple and it smells like
mango nothing like fancy about it it's
just a sweet fruity scent says luscious
true ripened mango and tropical
pineapple are complemented by crisp
Lotus and a hint of warm vanilla this
one's really nice I do really like
pineapple cents but I'll show you the
next Kendall I have and it's also
pineapple so I don't know between the
two which one I would you know
repurchase I would repurchase a
pineapple scent I just don't know
they're really similar so this is the
other scent I have this is pineapple
palm grass the description on this says
a fresh tropical fragrance inspired by
the beautiful pineapple fields and
exotic green foliage of the Hawaiian
Islands this one I think came out was
like their Hawaii collection last year I
still can't decide between the two of
them so I wouldn't say one or the other
you just have to smell them the
difference in them is seriously so
slight um this looks like more vanilla
pineapple that one's more mango
pineapple I do like this scent again I
just want to get through it and then
I'll just have one pineapple in my
collection instead of like two that
smell basically the same I mean you guys
can tell like not for so many of these
are not even burnt I usually like I'm
the type of person that goes with one
candle and I'll stick to the candle like
that candle finish and then I'll move on
to the new one or maybe I'll have two I
do like to keep it pretty one at a time
so yeah that's why I like banana visa
burn this candle here is Oceanside bath
and Bodyworks this smells like suntan
lotion and really like a clean Beach Sun
it's refreshing as a long getaway to the
ocean water eat greens and cucumber
blend deliciously
juicy melon and peony petals I do really
like this scent this is quite old I've
had this probably for two or three years
now
so this is on my list to burn up
probably by the end of February or
definitely the middle of March I do like
this and I probably would repurchase
something like it but I don't know if I
would just like have to have this one
but it does smell it smells quite nice
and fresh this cable here is drenched
Applewood drench apple flower actually
it's my favorite one that's sad this is
my favorite spring and summertime candle
to walk through the orchard after a
spring shower crispy Fuji apples blend
deliciously with rain-soaked greens and
pink lotus blossoms oh I just love this
it smells so floral but then it has that
Apple in it to make it sweet I just I
love this scent I had two backups I feel
like I gave someone one which I kind of
regret now but I probably will not burn
this until I know that they're coming
out with it again because he didn't come
out with it last spring so I really hope
they do I just this candle just smells
so good to me it's fresh and clean and
sweet and light I love love love this
candle and would definitely repurchase
and if they come out with it I'm
probably gonna put like three minimum as
backups in my collection this is the
only mini candle I have this is the
drenched apple flower but in the mini
version I have this just because again
they were like they didn't have many
left at the end of the season so I got
that but I don't usually purchase those
I don't I don't like the scent throw
they give so why waste my money on them
this one year is lemon mint leaf this
description is an organic cultivation of
bright lemon balm and farm fresh green
spearmint that's exactly what smells
like lemon and spearmint I really like
this scent but I'm definitely glad to
get it out of my collection I can't wait
to finish using this one up I only have
a little bit left it's a very
overpowering scent it can relax me but
then at the same time sometimes it just
gets too strong and I feel like it can
give me a headache too just with that
mint and the lemon I do really enjoy it
but it's also it's just like a whole lot
of hate ones so right now I'm excited to
get through it but I can see myself for
purchasing this in the future
these two are the same candle this is
Sunset Beach this came out with their
like summer collection last year
supposed to smell like fruit pops sugar
cane and sunrise it's just a nice sweet
beachy scent there's nothing super
special about it so I'm not like gunning
to get this one but just this the sense
in this category just reminds me of the
beach they remind me of summer so
they're just fun you know flirty
fragrances to have around the house and
I do really enjoy this so I'll enjoy
using these two up but whatever summer
collection they come out with this year
I would just be probably just as
satisfied with if it's in the similar
thing you know another one from that
same collection
this one's ocean driftwood this one says
an early morning walk along the coast
inspired this blood of beachside oak
mahogany and fresh air this is
definitely like a clean scent or like a
man scent but it's more of like a
summery one if that makes sense
I really enjoyed these types of scents
not all the time so I don't have like a
ton of them in my collection but I do
think they smell so nice I really liked
this one I thought they smelled really
similar to mango beechwood that came out
a long time ago like three years ago but
it didn't I just was like confused in
the store and then when I brought them
home I smelt that one and it's not the
same but this one still is really good
it's just more of a man scent that one
was fruity and mani this is just man oh
man this is the last candle I have from
that same collection this is endless
weekend this is a blend of fresh summer
Mandarin Sunkist Magnolia and blue
coconut water that evokes days of
sunshine and Happiness you wish would
never end it just it does that all for
you guys um this is a great scent this
is actually I think a part of their
permanent collection from that
collection if that makes sense
I like it I have hand soaps I have like
body sprays and this scent it's just a
nice you know again summery carefree
scent and I don't know if I ever
purchased the candle again but I will
enjoy it while I have it only two more
in the spring ones this is the red guava
lava like to say that Hawaii's
spectacular lava landscape is celebrated
enix
in an explosively fresh and fruity blend
of red guava and passionfruit
this is just a very fruity scent I don't
know what passionfruit and guava smell
like so I guess this is it
this scent and it's fruity and I'll use
it but I think what I'm learning as I
smell on these is that I really want to
make sure that I'm getting a scent that
not only do I like and oh yeah that's a
nice sight but that I really like think
oh no that's so good not just like oh
that's nice I have a lot of those and I
want to get work through those and just
have the ones I really really love in my
collection that's what I'm learning from
all these fruity ones I also I mean I
kind of know what I like I know I like a
lot of super fruity also really florally
ones I think just focusing on that when
I go to the store not getting
overwhelmed by every new scent is gonna
be my new goal last candle here this is
sundress now this one is definitely more
floral like out of everything I have it
says easy and breezy as a sunny day in
the garden
this one of bright day lilies tonka
beans in bergamot is a beautiful new
style of fragrance I like this thing
it's very clean and floral it's not
something I would repurchase I haven't
burnt it like what I smelled it I was
like oh I'm gonna love this one
so much like that smells so different
but also like totally me and I think
it's maybe just a little too clean for
me so it's not something like I just
like absolute love but I think I can you
know once they start burning this I
think I might really like it I don't
know if I repurchase this one exactly I
think I'll be happy to get get done with
this one personally
okay so now we're gonna go into my fall
and winter sense I feel like I have less
of these I think I have less of these
ones just because fall and winter Suns I
like them but I just love fruity and
floral so I still have a lot don't get
me wrong but it's just not as many
they're not I don't know I love them
when they come out and fall but I really
only like burning fall and winter sounds
like in fall like before Christmas once
Christmas hit it's like summer and
spring already in my head I lived in
Arizona and I live in California so
that's probably why there's no snow
nothing to remind me that oh yeah it's
wintertime this one is a three layered
candle by bath and Bodyworks this one is
called we love fall three layer candle
it has sweater weather sweet cinnamon
pumpkin and pumpkin apple in it honestly
I bought this because I had never seen
one like this from bath water works like
that's the reason I bought it never
granted it was like gimmicky so that's
why I bought it
this candle here is autumn this is my
absolute favorite favorite favorite fall
scent it smells so good I just I love
the scent I've been burning it for like
the last two or three years this one is
a Kris fall fragrance that blends dark
pomegranate and Red Delicious apple with
notes of fir balsam and rich cedar wood
oh I just this is like so good again
it's Apple I mean my two cents or have
Apple like in them so much Apple I just
love this scent when I smell it now it
reminds me of fall and it's just so good
they do come out with this like every
year so it must be a hit with a lot of
people and it doesn't have any cinnamon
in it that's something I love about it a
lot of Apple scents around fall have
cinnamon this one doesn't and it's just
mm-hmm so good I love that candle love
love love love would repurchase a
billion of those this candle right here
is caramel pumpkin swirl and it's a
boots and enjoy a marvelous mixture of
two O Falls most delicious scents as
sweet smooth caramel swirls fresh
pumpkin I like this one I have started
burning it a little bit it smells good
it's just a sin to have to be like in
the mood for I'm not into food scents I
think they're just too sweet for me I
like smelling them like once but to like
drench my whole house and them is kind
of a lot for me I just I like the
days were like the mood set maybe it's
overcast and it's cold out and you want
to watch Netflix with a blanket or
something then that's when I bust this
candle out and burn it other than that
it's it's harder for me to burn so I
just don't have a lot of these but I'm
glad I have this one I just wouldn't
have a ton of my collection this candle
is the ever-so-popular
leaves everyone loves this kind of like
freaks out about the scandal I like this
candle it definitely smells like the
holidays to me it's very cinnamony Apple
it says celebrate the brilliant colors
of autumn with this rich blood of golden
nectar red apples and berries it smells
really good it's just that cinnamon is
not my favorite scent I wish it was just
like the apples and berries and stuff
without the cinnamon but it does still
remind me of like winter so I do like it
I've never burnt it though I bought it
because everyone loves it and I thought
oh one day I'll be in the mood for this
and I just haven't yet I probably
wouldn't repurchase I would just rather
purchase autumn personally for my fall
candle is autumn not leaves this is just
another autumn it's just in the new
packaging from this year this candle
here is pumpkin Apple I bought this
because they had like a whole pumpkin
line this last fall this is experience a
blend of your two favorite fall cents
apple and pumpkin enhanced by notes of
cinnamon and clove yeah this one I like
this even I think better than leaves
it's a little more sweet with cinnamon
instead of spicy I think that's the
reason I don't like leaves it's just
because it's too spicy it's a little too
spicy no but I don't like it but I don't
love it I guess I probably wouldn't
repurchase this again I would just
rather have autumn so it's gonna be nice
to go through but I probably won't go
through this till next fall look a
different brand not just a new Body
Works this is a wood wick candle I got
it at t.j.maxx so this one is in the in
the scent vineyard and it smells like
berries it smells odd me to me so that's
why it's in this section I'm not happy
with how this scent at my house
personally I love the wick it's like a
force like it's like a star like a cross
wick and it crackles like a fireplace
and I do like that sometimes it freaks
me out like what's going on if I'm home
alone
I do like the style of this camel I just
personally probably would not repurchase
the scent I'm almost done with it so I'm
gonna try to finish it up this month and
just get it out of my life but I think
would like as a brand it has really nice
candles this is another candle that is
not bath and Bodyworks
this candle is from a loom this one's
called gilded amber leaf it doesn't give
me like a scent on here this is just a
very warm scent you can definitely smell
the amber I think of like amber
something at Bath Body Works like to
highlight woods like there's really warm
musky scent that's what this smells like
I did not pick this candle out myself
this came in a pop sugar box for
Christmas me and Sam got each other this
boxes for Christmas as our gift and this
came in there it's not my favorite type
of scent I don't dislike it but I
definitely would not repurchase this
scent and I don't know how this candle
will burn so hopefully it burns nicely I
probably won't be using this until next
winter it's just not even like it's hot
outside today like I cannot burn this
I'll feel like a mugging and nasty so
probably not tell winter this year like
the end of this year this candle here is
my mouth and body works and this is
sweater weather this is described as
cuddle up with an aerobic blend of
eucalyptus jus juniper berry and fresh
sage that celebrates the arrival of
sweater weather this one smells really
nice this is like mahogany teak wood
meets autumn it's like sweet but it also
has that manly scent in there I really
like this one I would repurchase this
one definitely but my favorites still
autumn I still love that one in case you
didn't know case you didn't understand I
have just like smaller ones now so this
one here is like the kind of small
candle not the mini but the small one
from Bath and Body Works in mahogany
teak woods I've had a full-size of this
I think I've had like two full-size of
this then I've gone through I love this
scent it just smells so good it smells
like a man and it's perfect for fall and
winter
my last three candles my last three
candles here are all Christmas scents
and I have them in the mason jars when I
bought these they were six dollars
apiece and then I had my 10 out of 30 so
I got six cents for I want to say like
they were so so cheap like for $20 and
that's how I'm just gonna buy the
Christmas sense just because I don't
burn through them fast enough like I
don't want to burn a Christmas sound
before Thanksgiving so you only have
like a month to burn em so if you have
them in the small ones you don't have
like this huge candle and you don't have
to go through as much the first one is
tis the season
I've never even burnt this one I'm
telling you it's taken me two years to
go through the six I have three left of
them like it's crazy this one smells
really good it's cinnamon II but it's
still very sweet she says rich red
apples green pine and attention and a
touch of golden cider combined to
capture all the joy and activities of
the holidays I would repurchase that one
but again probably just in a small one
this one is marshmallow fireside
everyone really likes this one so I
bought it it's good but again it's like
a foodie scent so it is quite sweet even
though it has that burnt smell in there
I don't know it smells good it's just
not one of my favorites so hopefully I
can go through that this winter and just
get it on my collection I probably would
not repurchase it though and last is
fresh balsam I love this scent it's so
funny because I used to hate this scent
like hate it it just sounds like a
Christmas tree it smells really good to
me it's just delicious they have another
one that smells like a Christmas tree
called Merry mistletoe and I do like
that one better it's sweeter so I
probably I mean I repurchase this one
but I probably would repurchase either
that one as well with it or just that
one if I had to choose between the two
so that is my collection I know that's a
lot of candles my goal this year is to
really work through a lot of them and
just pare it down make sure that their
candles that I love
none of those lackluster ones I wouldn't
recommend you guys do I have those in my
collection as I went through there were
none that I really want to like get rid
of so I feel good about that it's now
it's just down to actually burning them
and using them I'm definitely to make
sure that whenever I'm home for a
substantial amount of time I'm going to
be burning a candle and just working and
chugging through these so you'll
probably be seeing a lot of these in my
empties videos I hope you guys enjoy the
video and I will see you in my next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
