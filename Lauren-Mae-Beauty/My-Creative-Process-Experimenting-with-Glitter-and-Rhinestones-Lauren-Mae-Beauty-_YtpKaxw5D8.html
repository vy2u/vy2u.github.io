Lauren thank you so much for watching I
guess first things first this is fake
just so you guys know I'm going to be
doing a tutorial today and I've been
inspired by just like again the dual
Crohn's and the Glitter so this is gonna
be super heavily glitter based I don't
really know where I'm going I basically
just picked all the pretty products in
my collection that I'm like I want to
use that I want to use that and I'm
gonna come up with some type of like a
cereal ish look with glitter we're gonna
see how it goes
I'm gonna see you guys along with me
it's gonna be like a full face thing and
we'll see what we come up with so with
that let's just get started because I
don't want this to be a forever tutorial
first I'm going to be priming my face
this is the over cool as a cucumber
moisturizing primer I'm going to be
using a lot of products that are going
to be just hydrating and give me some
radiance so I think there will be
multiple layers when it comes to the
skin and the glow we're gonna try to
give this is just going to give like a
moisturizing base and that's what I want
from it I feel like my skin isn't so
freakin dry lately it doesn't matter
what I do it's so weird I really I mean
I have such oily skin but lately you
would not believe me if I said that for
even more of a glow I'm going in with
the one over one base glow sheer glowy
kind of highlighter I use this mostly as
like a second primer type of step and I
do like it for that it's quite shimmery
so I'm gonna go pretty heavy usually
I'll just add a little bit but I'm doing
a full pump on my face today before we
go in with the foundation I want to go
in with my Becca corrector this is an
under-eye corrector and I'm just going
to be taking a little bit on my finger
and putting this on the under eye area
just in the darkest area which is in the
most inner corner for me I've tried
using a brush with this but I find that
using your finger is the best way to
just get the thinnest amount of product
and it just kind of melts the product
into the skin better so you don't need a
lot with this I like to just do a little
because we are gonna still conceal but I
do find that it helps just kind of
bright in that area and now for
foundation this is not the original
packaging of the foundation this is
the Lancome tinted ol foundation like
the stick one I've used everything up in
the front part of the stick so I dug
everything out put it in this pot and
I'm still using it because I love it
it's so good I think I'm gonna
repurchase this I can bring it with me
to Italy cuz it's that good I'm just
gonna be putting this on my face with a
brush and I wanted to say a few things
here first off I wanted to say thank you
so much for all of the love on my last
video with Sam like the two that I did I
did like a-tryin weird product from
Daiso video and then we did a weird
Costco haul and I just wanted to do this
cuz it sounded so fun and I honestly
didn't think that they would get that
many views or like I don't know I'm just
like this will be fun I just want to do
it but so many of you guys like loved it
so that felt really awesome and I'm glad
you guys enjoyed it and yeah I'll try to
have Sam on more often he's not like
super into being on my channel but uh if
I can coax him into being on it
sometimes I definitely will I also
wanted to say that I am going to do a
Q&amp;amp;A so if you have any questions please
leave them in this video I might mention
it in like one other video and then in
my next group of videos where I have
those videos posted I will do a Q&amp;amp;A so
yeah if you have any questions for me a
lot of the questions that I've been
getting have been about being a makeup
artist and also about me and Sam's
relationship so if you have anything
that you want me to talk about or answer
please leave a question down below and I
will do my best to try to answer as many
questions as possible in that video I
will say if being in a stick is so much
easier than it being in a pot but I'll
make it work I didn't want to waste the
product in the container so that's all
I'm going to do for foundation I feel
like it's pretty light I'm not trying to
really cover everything in the skin plus
we're gonna just have so many
highlighting elements that I feel like
that's gonna distract from anything
anyway I don't want it to look too heavy
so I'm gonna go on with concealer next
this one is the Milani one this is
probably my favorite one now I used to
love the Maybelline fit me but I don't
know what it is like it's just different
to me and I don't know if it's actually
different or if it's just me feeling
like it's different or what but yeah I
just enjoy the formula of this so much
more like I'm
thinking about getting it for my kit and
just taking the sponges off so I can
like apply it on my skin cuz I love it
that much and I use it so much and
sometimes I just want the tiniest amount
of coverage like I don't want something
too concealing I just want it to look a
little bit more perfected just a little
more put together anyway I really love
that concealer I know it I don't think
it gets that much loved in the community
but it's one of my favorites and I'm
just gonna blend this in with my Beauty
Blender I really enjoy blending and
concealer with a sponge so we're done
with that now normally I would go in
with a powder next but we're gonna use
some liquid highlighters I'm gonna be
using a mix of two different ones this
is the tardis Pro glow highlighter this
is super metallic and super shimmery
definitely not a natural look with a
highlighter and then how could I do a
glitter like base tutorial without the
cover effects of glitter drop so I'm
gonna be using these ones these are in
the shade Mirage which is like the light
golden white ones I'm gonna go in with
the Tarte first and I'm gonna just put a
little bit on the back of my hand and
I'm just going to use my fingers to tap
this into the highest point of the
cheekbone so just so you guys know kind
of what I'm trying to do with this look
I want to have like really highlighted
glittery cheekbones and then I think I'm
gonna do something kind of like glittery
up from the brows that's kind of what
I'm thinking that's just kind of where
my brains been going I even have like
rhinestones out I have my milk glitter
stick honestly that was kind of the
entire inspiration for this because I'm
doing a haul in retrospect I realized I
have not used it so I was like you know
what I'm gonna freakin use it before
that's part of the reason I do whole and
retro specks is to kind of remember that
I have stuff so yeah that's what we're
gonna do I'm gonna put a tiny bit of
this on my nose I'm gonna just start
laying the foundation to above my
eyebrow with this I'm gonna put a little
on my Cupid's bow and then a little bit
on the chin as well and that basically
used up all that product now this is
gonna be so much layering obviously I
don't even know if you guys are gonna
like recreate this or just more of an
entertainment factor but if you are
gonna recreate this you definitely don't
need to use all of these products I'm
just being super extra and just using
what I have so
I just suggest like pulling out all your
butter and like trying to come up with
some type of cohesive look to make all
that work so oh here we go I'm going in
with the glitter drops these are very
glittery if you want glitter my friend
these will get you it and I'm just using
my finger mostly because I don't want to
dirty up my beauty sponge if I'm being
just honest and this I'm kind of like
making go a little bit more than just
like the very center of the cheekbone
because I'm gonna be adding that milk
glitter so I want to have like a
gradient of glitters and this one
although it's a lot of glitter it's very
finely milled so I'm hoping that I can
like have this kind of be out and then
the other glitter more centralized and
dense again that's the plan anyway and I
don't think I'm gonna be putting these
glitter drops anywhere else so I'm not
gonna be putting these on the Cupid's
bow or anything like that I want to keep
the glitter areas still kind of
something special I guess I'll connect
them here in this like C shape as well
now I'm gonna set my face with powder
this is the Becca soft light blurring
powder this does have a tiny bit of
shimmer to it so it works really well
with this look although I have been
wearing this every day since I got it
and it's been probably a good two weeks
and I really really enjoy it so I'm
gonna lightly set the center of my face
as well as the perimeter and I'm just
trying to kind of make sure none of that
is gonna move around and it's just going
to help us layer products so I haven't
filmed in a while guys I was I was able
to actually proof um quite a few videos
which has been nice because I went to
Arizona if you guys follow me on
Instagram you saw that I went to
Hamilton and it was so good I really
enjoyed it
I've been singing Alexander Hamilton so
much it's like ridiculous who knew that
we would all be singing rap songs about
Alexander Hamilton right like what the
heck but I've really been enjoying it
was so good and it was nice to have a
little bit of a break like that's the
biggest break I've had because I got a
new computer he's been wanting a new
computer for awhile I think the computer
we have is from 2008 it's like an old
old Mac it's so old let's move on for a
second I am gonna add a little
bronzor today so I'm just taking this
number seven one but I've got a new
computer and it's a Mac like an iMac and
it's like frickin crazy strong I want to
let you guys know how much time I would
spend like you guys know I upload every
single day but it would take me so long
to export and render and do all the
stuff it would take me an hour just to
import footage onto my computer if I had
like a full card of like 32 gigs of
footage it would take at least an hour
to upload that onto my computer now that
takes less than five minutes
I also if it was like a twenty to thirty
minute video it would take you know just
as many hours or however long to edit
but then it would take like at least a
good hour hour and a half to render and
then after that you have to export it
and that would take me probably a good
three ish hours her to export so I
always had to be like so ahead and with
my new computer it literally takes five
minutes to just like export I don't have
to render any more for whatever reason
although I will say it takes a little
bit longer to upload to YouTube but I
mean nowhere near you know as long as it
took me to do all the other stuff so
I've just like had this renewed love of
life getting things done and editing
because it just doesn't take as much
time anymore and like I appreciate the
machine that I had and I mean it allowed
me to do all of the YouTube work that I
did thus far and that was amazing and I
made it work you know but it's so nice
to have so many hours of my week cut out
from like doing YouTube behind the
scenes work and it's just exciting to do
some normal things and not only have
like YouTube constantly on the brain I
was able to do so much pretty stuff that
I haven't normally been able to do and
it allowed me to actually take a break
which is so great all right so we're
looking pretty dang good I think we're
gonna move on to eyebrows now no I'll do
blush I'll do a little bit of blush
today we're using one of my favorites
this is a bora bora from laura geller
and this has just a light sheen to it I
didn't want anything taking away from
everything else and I didn't want to
strangle color so it's just a light
peachy pink I thought it was like a nice
ethereal a little flush going on on the
cheeks I guess we'll just go in with a
bit of a highlighter now I don't
I don't know what I want to do I'm gonna
add a little bit of a base for my
highlight I'm gonna go in with the shade
illusion here this has a bit of a purple
reflect to it so I want to go kind of
lightly with that and then this is the
shade on point from the palette it's
another like pink I just want to go so
gently I'm just these powders are like
crazy so I'm gonna like really scared
like tap like you're really scared of
the product and then I'm gonna go into
my cheekbones and just kind of put this
exactly where we put all the other
products and we're gonna be layering
about 700 highlighters today again we're
just trying to build up some fun color
and just something different I just want
this to be a fun look is ultimately what
I am trying to get from it and I'm
keeping my eye look pretty neutral
because I really wanted to stand out to
be the glitter and rhinestones and
whatever else ends up going on my face
and I am gonna take this one on the tip
of my nose so that gives like a nice
pinky sheen and then I'm gonna go in
with my new highlighter from Dior this
one is the shade 0-2 pink nude something
pink this is actually very similar to
the wet and wild highlighter I actually
just bought but I don't know I feel like
I kind of like this one more and I don't
know why I'm gonna be highlighting all
the same areas I think we have enough
highlighter for the moment we will of
course be probably out any more but I'm
gonna zoom us in we're gonna do my
eyebrows and I'm gonna show you the way
I've been doing them the last couple
days and I've really been enjoying it's
like super bushy super like messy but
I've been loving it so let me zoom in
and we'll get started on the eyes
alright so resumed in nice and close I'm
gonna go in with my spoolie on my brow
pencil and I'm just going to be brushing
my brow hairs and mostly just up and
just kind of getting out any product
that may be got in them from doing my
face and I'm just going to be kind of
defining this bottom part of my brow
again pretty gently this one from
colour-pop is really good about not
depositing too much color and again I'm
just kind of defining the like bottom
portion of the tail
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going
in with a tinted brow gel this one
happens to be from Lancome I've also
been using the Maybelline one just
whatever you have and we're going to
start by depositing most of the color in
this back portion of the brow because
these tend to like deposit a lot so if
you start at the back where you kind of
can handle more color you can then
feather it in in the front and we're
just brushing them up and out and just
kind of letting them be their crazy
little selves and I'm just adding a
little bit more to the tail because I do
want that to be more defined than it is
but there's just really no precision to
it and I'm just gonna do that to the
other side as well alright so those are
what the brows look like super messy
super just like fun I've honestly been
doing them this way because I've just
been lazy and haven't wanted to like
really fill them in so I just
experimented and was like hey I'm like
that so I'm gonna go in and prime my
eyelids we already have some creasing
going on and something I'm not gonna do
today is I'm not gonna set my eyelid
primer because the palette I'm gonna use
it just you know it was not a good first
impression so I'm hoping that this will
be a solution she was a problems I were
I was finding the problems I were
finding the problems I was finding so
we'll see if this helps with a little
bit more of like a sticky base the
palette I'm gonna be using today is this
one from Velvet 59 it's the rose metals
palette and I did get this from actually
so this is what it looks like so pretty
I'm gonna be focusing on these two
colors today just because I want some
things still kind of light I don't want
anything to take over too much so I'm
gonna be using this as kind of like a
soft transition it does have a bit of
glitter in it so we'll see how that
works out and translates I just want to
keep this as soft as possible while
still having obviously some definition
on the eyelids so I'm just blending this
with a fluffy brush into the crease so
that color seems to work out pretty fine
I don't think I got too much glitter
fallout from the little specks but even
if I did I mean I have glitter all over
my face at the moment so it kind of
worked out for this look next I'm gonna
be taking this
light metallic color this is called 22k
the thing I found is that these are just
so powdery but then there's not like a
ton of pigmentation like I just I don't
know I'm not so far a fan of this I do
have a coupon code that optionally
supplied it's not like an affiliate so
if you really want to try this out for
yourself you can use that code it's like
50% off so you are saving a lot but I
don't know so far I don't I just don't
think it's worth that so anyway I'm
going to be putting this on the lid
trying to build this up seeing what I
can kind of make happen with it like it
looks pretty and fine I just don't think
it's anything super special I do think
that having a bit more of a sticky base
has helped with the color though
sticking and I'm gonna bring this into
where we blended that other shadow just
because it doesn't matter if shimmers in
the crease for me today because I want
shimmer everywhere I'm gonna go back in
with my knee 40 and just kind of blend
it out I mean this looks really pretty
don't get me wrong
I just there's just something about
these shadows that I can't put my finger
on why I don't like them I'm liking the
way that look so next I'm gonna go in
and take that same brown shade and just
kind of run it under the eye and I'm
gonna run it pretty heavily I really
like the way that's looking so far I
think next I'm just gonna go in with the
glitter stick just you're gonna get a
base of what's going on I just have a
mini guy from milk and I'm going to be
putting this in all the areas that I've
already put on and I'm going to be just
going straight from this stick and
seeing what happens this has a bunch of
different glitters in it but I find that
the purple kind of like shows up the
most I'm having to like there's like a
film building up so I'll just like every
now and then kind of rub it on my hand
and then go back in with like fresh
product and that seems to help I think
that looks nice I don't think it added
as much as I thought because I added all
the other stuff so that's something I
think to spice up the eye I'm gonna go
in with this from colour-pop this is the
Lucky Penny shade and I think this is so
and I just want to like tap this in the
center of the eyelid this one is just so
beautiful I love it
definitely best use though like topper
and not necessarily like trying to get
an opaque situation going on cuz I tried
doing that with another shade and oh my
gosh it was the scariest situation so
even my mom was like please take that
off I was like I know you're right I'm
so pretty I definitely think you could
use these as a highlighter too they just
set so you have to be kind of careful
I'm gonna go in and tight line using a
white liner on the lower lash line in
the waterline I'm also gonna take this
glitter liner from Urban Decay and I'm
gonna be putting that on actually I'm
gonna put a really bright highlight
there right so I'm gonna go in with the
Dior highlighter I'm going to put this
on the inner corner and just you know
put it pretty heavily to highlight and
now I'm gonna go in with the Urban Decay
clitter liner and just kind of go on top
of that and bring it down on the lower
lash line a little and I'm bringing it
kind of low I don't know I'm just kind
of trying to make the most impact that I
can next I'm gonna go in with some
rhinestones I want to mention here like
please only use like I save glitters I
mean I'm using everything that's
prepared and like able to be on the eyes
these rhinestones I'm going to be
putting on like this area of the face
because they're a little bit smaller and
I have some like really pretty colors in
here and then these are a bit bigger and
I'm gonna be going in with some bigger
ones and I'm gonna put them like one
here and one here I really love that dot
look I really loved it when I did the
red and I might I might do some type of
like crystal thing on my eyebrow so I'm
just going to be doing that oh shoot
this opened wow I just like spilled a
million of them okay I'm gonna be doing
that I'm gonna stick them on with the
next glitter glue don't know if that's
gonna work but I think I'm gonna zoom
this out just a little bit and you guys
can see me do that in fast motion
all right so I have all of the glitter I
guess that I really want to do I like it
I think it looks pretty cool I think the
next step is basically just mascara to
finish off the eyes probably shouldn't
have done these until I did the mascara
but you know you love any learn I'm
gonna be putting on some of the benefit
roller lash and then I will get back and
we'll finish up the lip so I'll show you
guys the final look just something fun I
don't know let me know what you guys
think about it but I'll get back we'll
do lips my eyelashes are coated I'm
gonna be going in with two different lip
products this is buxom dolly which is
one of my favorite lip products it's
just gonna give me a nice all-over base
and then I'm gonna be using one of my
nude lip glosses from colour-pop this is
the shade finesse which is just like a
really pretty duochrome ish glittery top
coat and I think it'll complement to
look really well I'm super into it I'm
getting like some like Gwen Stefani
vibes and I love it so I'm gonna put
this on and I'll be back I just spent a
little bit of the gloss on because I
didn't wanted to over take too much so I
kind of centered it in the center of the
lips I'm gonna zoom out and show you
guys to find a look and we'll see what
we think
alright so this is a final look guys I
hope you guys enjoy it I really love it
I think if you wanted to make this more
wearable you could just do the eye look
I think it would be so pretty with or
without the rhinestones on the eye I
just think it's so beautiful it's
neutral and just light it's so pretty I
probably will be wearing that again just
that portion I think it's so nice the
rhinestones on the forehead definitely
make this more of like a character look
I just wanted to do something fun with
rhinestones means glitter today so I
hope you guys enjoy it I hope it
inspired you to be a little bit creative
do something fun to pull out some of
those products that never get loved but
you bought because they're so pretty or
because you could do this look with it
like just do it it doesn't have to be
Halloween just you know take some time
on a weekend or whenever you don't have
anything to do and just be experimental
and have some fun I really do feel very
like kind of Gwen Stefani and also kind
of like the neverending story like the
princess in it but she has like more of
like a red eye look but anyway that's
everything guys I hope you enjoyed and I
will see you my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
