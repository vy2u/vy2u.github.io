learn thanks so much for watching this
is gonna be a video all about lip
products that are for lazy girls or
girls who just don't like wearing like
lip products over my time over YouTube
and just in my life I realized that I
don't love like liquid lips I don't like
really intense lips I'm the tech person
that could put a lip balm on and go or
just like nothing I don't know what it
is I just don't really care for really
pigmented lips on me I realized they
don't really like really defined lips on
me so this is going to be some of my
favorite products that I've found that I
actually like wearing that I actually
get you sad about in my collection I
know a lot of people love lip products
but I wanted to make a video for the
other girls out there like me who were
just you know yeah you want something to
give color to your face but you're just
you're not that into it so anyway I have
a couple different products in here I
want to start off first with lip balms
because as someone who doesn't really
enjoy wearing a ton of lip products lip
balms are awesome the first product I
have here to mention are newer to my
collection these are from Revlon and
they are called the Revlon kiss and
they're just balms they have a bunch of
different colors and smells in the
collection my absolute two favorite are
the peach and the coconut the coconut is
completely clear and it smells so good I
just washed mine these live in my purse
see that it's just basically a balm like
Sam my husband can use this too it
smells so good it's this is my favorite
one it's easy it feels nice on the lips
it doesn't feel too greasy it's not too
waxy it's just that perfect in-between
lip balm easy to wear easy to put on you
don't have to think about it the second
color the peach one here it smells so
good again like peaches I assume this is
what like the Too Faced sweet peach
palette smells like mmm it smells so
good I love peach scents this has the
absolute tiniest amount of color right
there it just gives my lips a little bit
of something nothing too much it's
perfect for all the time again you don't
need like a mirror to put this on it's
perfect I do have one other one I don't
use this one nearly as much this one has
never been in my purse which to me is
like a big test to like if I actually
use it if it goes in my purse I probably
actually use that product this is the
Apple scented one this one has the most
color payoff out of every
and it has a little bit of a red tint to
it it has the same formula smells great
I just tend not to reach for red lips so
that's why I haven't used it as much but
I think this is still a really pretty
color and I think a ton of people would
love this again there are more colors
and scents I believe there's at least
three more so I would check them out if
you want some low maintenance lip colors
that are easy to use hydrating and just
perfect for everyday next for lip balms
I wanted to bring up the fresh sugar lip
balms my absolute favorite lip balm ever
on this entire planet is the fresh sugar
lip balm and just the regular red
packaging it smells like lemons it feels
so nice on the lips it is an expensive
lip balm I think the price has gone up
from 2250 to like $24 but honestly it's
like the one lip product that I think is
worth it to me it feels just as
luxurious as the price point would
suggest so it's worth it to me the only
one I have here in person to show you
guys is the sugar rosy lip tint this is
my next favorite one I just don't have
that one right now I've used it all up
this is very similar to the other
products I was showing you from Revlon
but just more expensive it feels so nice
on the lips this gives you the tiniest
rose tint I highly suggest this or the
original lip balm the honey one's also
really nice if you're looking for
something a little more nude and not so
rose these just moisturize and feel so
good these are just a bit higher price
point so but still amazing love these I
wanted to mention a lip balm that I
don't bring with me coz it's in a jar
but that I absolutely love using ever
since I bought this I've been using it
every single night and this is from
nooks it's the breathe DeMille I think
that's how you say it it smells like
citrus and honey it's it's just great
this hydrates the lips so well and I
highly suggest this this costs $15 which
is a bit pricey but you get so much in
here and even if you're using it
everyday it's gonna take forever to go
through so I highly suggest this if
you're just wanting like a nighttime lip
balm or something to keep by your desk
or anywhere where you can easily put
your fingers into it and not get it
really contaminated and while I'm
mentioning like a pot lip balm I want to
mention the Korres lip butters I
remember those being so popular on
YouTube a couple years back but I really
love the Jasmine one the smell of it is
absolutely amazing and I really love the
color it gives my lips but again because
that's in a pot it's not something
like to bring with me so that's
something I like to wear either at night
or like to put on in the morning right
before I leave out the door or something
but I don't bring it with me because I
don't want to contaminate it it's just
so hard to deal with like making sure
your fingers are clean while you're on
the go but I highly suggest those and
those I believe are $12 which is a
reasonable price let's move on to some
other products these are more of your
traditional type of lipsticks I guess
you could say but you will notice one
thing I don't have anything in a bullet
form I love sticks I love easy more
precise lipsticks something that's kind
of in between a lip liner and the
traditional bullet yeah so that's what I
mostly have here I'll start off with my
absolute favorite ones these are from
buxom and these are called the full-on
lip sticks yeah full-on lipsticks my
absolute favorite color is dolly you
guys know that if you watch my channel
I've actually gone through a full one of
these and repurchase because I love it
that much this is the perfect everyday
shade for me I love the formula of these
these have like a minty scent they look
matte on the lips and they stay on for
quite a while I feel like I can feel
that minty tingling sensation for a long
time after putting these on I just
highly suggest them I think they're
worth twenty dollars I want to get a
couple more shades the other color
though that I actually have is called
Sydney this one is a little bit more of
like a traditional nude I definitely
don't like it as much as dolly because
it doesn't give my face as much color as
I like this just gives the perfect
amount of color you know when you do
your foundation so foundation gets on
your lips you just need something to
kind of bring you back from the dead and
Dolly does that for me
I just love it and I highly suggest
these anyone that's ever like commented
in the comments about these has loved
them just as much as me so of course all
these products are gonna be linked if I
can find them but these are the ones
that I suggest the most and absolutely
love specifically dolly is like the shiz
it's so good I have a few products here
from nude Stix now I'm not suggesting
you a specific color I think you should
find the one that matches for you but I
just like this formula and I just like
the format just everything about this
most of these are the lip and cheek
pencils and then I do have one that's
like the matte version of those but
these are just so good I got these when
I was working at my old beauty store
I think the formula is really nice and I
just love the whole idea of them they're
easy to go this one right here is called
blush another trend you're gonna see is
I don't like anything that's super
opaque like I was mentioning before
I'm just not someone who really likes
like a defined lip I like something
that's just a little bit more soft a
little bit more natural that has a
little bit of transparency to it and
kind of lets your natural lips shine
through this color here is Sol I promise
it's different than the other one the
one color that I suggest to everyone
that I actually don't have here with me
is called mystic I keep it in my kit and
I'm almost done with it like I need to
repurchase it because I use it on
everyone that color just looks good on a
range of skin tones if you're really
fair it's like a darker nude if you have
a little bit more pigment to your skin
it just looks like a nice soft nude so i
really suggest that to everyone like if
you need a place to start start with
mystic and i promise you'll love it let
me finish watching these though for you
whisper is a really pretty one samantha
from battle ash really likes this color
it's beautiful it's just a really pretty
nude color this next one is very very
nude this is flesh i like to use that to
kind of like highlight in the center of
lips or just lightly put over something
if it's a little bit dark i can lighten
it up with that color it's still really
transparent though so it kind of gives
it more like a milky look than just like
complete whiteout and then the last one
here is the matte version and this is in
the color belle and that's it there so I
just think they'd have a great range of
colors they have some like brighter
colours I know one's called ripe that's
really pretty it's kind of this
in-between red orange coral but again it
has that transparency to it so it's
nothing too intense but I just really
like everything about these pencils the
only negative to me is the fact that
these aren't like easy to twist up you
do have to sharpen them and sometimes
that's not the most convenient when
you're on the go regardless I still like
them so I still suggest them like I just
think they're great next I have very
similar products in the last one these
are from NARS though and these are their
lip pencils I have some satin ones I
have some velvet matte ones so I think
everyone's pretty familiar with rakubian
because we all got this as a birthday
gift at some point in our lives from
Sephora it just has a nice Sheen to it
nothing too matte it's comfortable on
the lips you can apply this without a
like mirror if you had to I just think
this is such a natural pretty color this
one came in a set so
don't know how accessible it is this has
a little bit more color to it because
it's not that sharp and it's kind of
scratching it off but this isn't the
color Torres De Panne I'm sure I'm
butchering that again just giving you an
idea of the consistency of them these
two swatches are both from satin lip
pencils so we do have that Sheen to them
and then this one here is the color
patina and this is a velvet mat so this
has a matte texture on the lips but it's
still so comfortable I really like this
color but it definitely doesn't give me
a ton of like vibrancy this is more of
like a nude on me I do really like it
though and I think this color is really
nice this is something I bought in the
full-size so I really do like them they
have a ton of shade so you can
definitely find something that you like
and I just think they're they're just
nice like I just I love pencils in that
form I don't know what it is I just
think they're so much easier to apply
than like a regular bullet lipstick and
I will mention again with those you do
have to sharpen them so hopefully that's
not like a deal-breaker but let's move
on to some products that are very
similar to those but in a more
affordable price range the first one I
want to mention here is from Revlon I
believe these are new from their line or
newer and this is the color HD dawn and
it's part of their like HD lipstick
collection this is so pretty the more I
wear this the more I like it do you guys
see a trend going on I just really like
the color of this I love that it's
transparent
this one has a tiny tiny bit of like a
sparkle to it it's not glitter and it's
not gonna like leave your lips gross
with like nothing on them but the
glitter stuck around it just makes them
look healthy and I just I love it I'm
gonna swatch dolly next to it just to
see how similar they are because I feel
like they look really close yeah they're
pretty similar not exact but if you want
something that's very similar to dolly
just to kind of dip your toe this isn't
going to be nearly as matte but it's
gonna be a very similar color I love
that it doesn't leave like a pink tint
to my lips as I wear it it's just really
soft really pretty and it has a nice
like fruity scent to it and the last one
in a stick form like that is going to be
color pops Lumiere this is a swatch of
Lumiere here this is one of their matte
formulas but I definitely think
a little bit of a sheen to it this is
basically the darkest I'll go on like an
everyday lip this gives my lips more
definition than the other lip colors
here so if I really want them to look
fuller or just want to look more put
together this is the lip color I will go
for it's really just such a pretty color
I think that kathleenlights did such a
great job like creating this color I
know that Lumiere comes in a bunch of
different forms
I believe so if you're looking for a
different type of formula but want a
similar color I would check those out on
the website okay guys we have two more
lip products to talk about now I know
glasses aren't for everyone but I do
have two glosses that I really do enjoy
and then I wanted to mention the first
one here is from buxom this is the
classic color White Russian this is like
everyone's favorite gloss from them this
is the perfect everyday lip color you
can put this on over something if you
want you can put this on by itself
I love the Minji jingle this gives to my
lips it does definitely feel like it's
plumping a bit I also really like the
buxom lip gloss and dolly imagine that I
just think these are really nice lip
glosses if you want something that's
gonna stick around on your lips a little
bit longer and you're into glosses these
are really good ones they have like a
hundred different colors too so if you
need to find a lip gloss or you know are
really picky they have definitely a
shade for you somewhere in their line
and the last lip gloss I wanted to
mention was this one from colour-pop now
I I didn't even order this they sent
this to me to say sorry for my order
being late which I didn't even realize
it was late so you know they didn't have
to do that but this is what I've been
wearing throughout the whole video and
this is something I've just been loving
lately I've been wearing this in so many
videos and just in everyday life it's
just so easy to put on this is a lip
gloss that's actually not sticky like
nothing about this is sticky I love that
these have pigmentation but they're not
like overly like sticky so I don't feel
like they're getting everywhere I just I
love this formula I definitely want to
pick up a couple more of these in
different shades let me tell you the
shade of this one this one is in Finders
Keepers and it's just beautiful it's
just a straight-up cream there's no
glitter in it there's no weird you know
stuff in it I just love this and for the
price you really can't beat it I hope
you guys enjoyed this video this is
something that just came to my mind was
like I want to show everyone my favorite
lip products I have to like force myself
to use other things
other than these in my collection I feel
like I could get rid of everything else
in my personal lip drawer and I'd be
totally fine because these are what I
actually wear every single day please
please leave any suggestions down below
if there's some products out there you
think I would absolutely love and really
wanted to try the color pop like satin
lip colors I don't even know what are
they called satin liquid lipsticks the
ones that don't dry down matte all the
way and I do want to try the bare
minerals ones and also the buxom ones
I've heard that those don't dry down
they kind of stay just moosie and matte
and that sounds like so much more
enjoyable to me than those just really
dry and matte liquid lipsticks I know so
many people love them and if you do
that's awesome it's just I I don't know
I just don't I don't put my lips through
torture and it's just not worth it to me
so and again I just don't like having
that really defined lip line like I want
something that's a little bit softer you
know anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
and again let me know your favorites
down below or if any of these are your
favorites just any suggestions I will
take them because I do want to have like
a little bit of different colors and I
enjoy finding lip colors I love to use I
just want to make sure there are things
I actually love because I don't I just
don't need the rest I just want the
love's I don't know where this ultra is
going so I'm gonna end it here I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day
thanks so much for watching and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
