Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be talking to you
guys all about my favorite brushes my
favorite brush Styles what I use them
for what I use on myself and then also
what I use in my kit and use on other
people because it is a little bit
different I tend to go for different
brushes for different things so up front
this video is going to be a long one so
strap in I'm gonna have time stamps down
below and I thought the best way to
organize this video was to go by step in
the routine of doing your face so I'm
going to go from primer all the way down
to lips and I'm going to show you guys
the brushes that I use my favorite ones
some of these are in kits so you can
only get them that way but I'll let you
guys know everything will be linked down
below and I'll have it broken up by
category so you guys can easily find the
brush you're looking for and then the
only other thing I think I want to say
before I get into it is that I tend to
have really affordable brushes I just am
NOT at a place right now where I really
want to spend a ton of money on brushes
so most of these are pretty affordable
like really cheap or it's like one I
invested in because I wanted a specific
purpose but I would say most of these
are in the very affordable range so if
you were looking for affordable brushes
that are awesome I think you'll really
like this when it comes to high-end
brushes I just haven't had the
experience yet it's not that I don't
want to try them I just haven't ever
been in a position to be able to buy
them and yeah I just I enjoy it a good
cheap brush so I think that's everything
so let's get into the brushes and we'll
start with the ones I use for primer you
might be wondering primer we always see
you apply your primer with your fingers
and I do for myself I always apply my
primer with my fingers but on my clients
I'd use a paddle brush or a foundation
brush so I have one here from Sigma this
is the Sigma foundation f60 brush this
is what I use in my kit currently and I
use this to apply any lotions any
primers on the skin anything that isn't
foundation this just you know applies it
really nicely I don't have to touch
their face I will say though as a makeup
artist sometimes you do touch their face
depending on the look that you want from
a product or whatever I mean we're
working with sanitized products in Santa
hands and sanitized brushes so it's not
uncommon for makeup artists to use their
fingers or hands on people's skin I just
prefer not to do it unless I have to and
then the other one that I have here is
slightly different so this one is a bit
shorter and this one came in a Coastal
Scents set so I'm gonna leave that link
down below it's a very very affordable
set they did send this out to me though
and this one I bought I'll try to tell
you which ones I bought and which one
are sent even though it doesn't matter I
like what I like I like what I like a
good brushes is the only thing that I
like anyway I really enjoyed this one I
really like the shape of it that it's a
little bit I'm just stubbier there's
something about it that I really enjoy I
also think these are great brushes for
any type of a mask that you're gonna do
like a mud mask or anything if you want
to apply it you can get nice even coats
and everything so those are my preferred
primer brushes obviously it's kind of
like a type a lot of the times you get
that type of brush of the kit so that's
just an idea of what you could do with
it and that's what you're gonna see
there's kind of a trend I feel like in a
lot of cases you don't have to have the
exact same brush you can just go with a
similar style so if it's shaped
similarly and if it has a similar
density it's probably gonna work in a
very similar way obviously some brushes
are just extraordinary or way better or
whatever we prefer them and since most
of these are affordable if you really
wanted to get them you could but I just
think that's something to keep in mind I
think something on YouTube is like it's
all about like this product does this
and this brush does this and I feel like
with brushes that's way more true but I
do think that it's all about technique
and using brushes and again working with
the density and the shape and stuff it
doesn't have to be the exact same brush
if that makes sense so next let's move
on to foundation brushes I have a lot
here I did not like wash all my brushes
just to show you guys so I'm really
sorry if you don't like that but yeah I
just I didn't I'm gonna start with two
classics these are from Sigma I feel
like they're kabuki brushes you just
can't go wrong I know they are a bit
pricey but I know these are gonna last
you I mean they're tried-and-true
favorites in the community for a reason
so this is the f80 brush it's a flat top
kabuki brush that you can use to buff on
foundation to the skin I really enjoyed
this brush I think it works very nicely
if I had to suggest one of these brushes
out of the two from Sigma I do suggest
the 3d HD max
Buki brush which is not something that I
thought I would say as you can tell the
shape of this is definitely just
different you know it has a strange cut
but what I love about this that I didn't
know I would is that I can get into my
nose area I can get under the eye a bit
I just can kind of get into the grooves
of the face a little bit better this is
also quite a bit bigger so you can kind
of get it done faster this also seems to
have a little bit more give to it
especially on the ends and I just enjoy
that as well so this is one of my
absolute favorite foundation brushes
this next brush is very similar to those
like kabuki brushes this is from RC
cosmetics I was sent this from Heather
from Love Heatherette she had like a
double of it and was getting rid of it
so she sent it over to me and I think
this is pretty inexpensive so I think
it's like a good dupe this has a rounded
angled edge to it and I really like the
way this applies I feel like this is
very similar in application it's not
quite as heavy of a brush but it
performs very nicely I do like the angle
of this as well I just I really do like
angled brushes and how they sit on the
skin because they get rid of the sharp
like unnatural angles of some brushes
because they lay flat to the skin so I
really enjoyed this brush for foundation
as well and the last type of brush that
I want to mention for applying
foundation is a stippling brush this one
happens to be from Eden minerals and I
really do like this specific one but I
do just in general like the idea of a
stippling brush this is going to be a
duo fiber brush it's not as dense as
those kabuki brushes so it's not going
to give you us full of coverage but
sometimes I really like that if you're
looking for a nice light coverage to the
skin you don't want too much buildup of
product I really enjoy a stippling brush
for that this one's a really nice one
but I know there are some from ELF that
one's a little bit more flimsy for sure
this one's a little bit more dense than
that one but I do really enjoy a
stippling brush for a more medium
coverage foundation or if you're wanting
to kind of share something out or not
have a lot of buildup of product on the
skin
and last is one you're like wait that's
a foundation brush compared to the other
ones I believe this is for real
techniques and I think it's just like a
setting powder brush or maybe you could
use it as a highlight or two that's
something with brushes like you can use
them for whatever you want to use them
for you do not have to use them for
whatever they say however it works for
you and it's how I think you should use
them and that's how what I do like I
need to create a certain look and that's
how I play around with my brushes I
don't care what you say you are but
anyway this is what I like to apply
foundation on to my clients so I know
this is very tiny so there's a part of
that that it's gonna take just a little
bit more time to just apply product on
the skin but I love just kind of buffing
really lightly with this especially for
men's grooming a lot of the work that I
do is for like film so it doesn't need
to look really heavy makeup and I just
like how like light and you know easy I
can get into different areas with this
little brush so this is what I mostly
use on people for foundation in my kit
and I highly suggest that brush I really
really enjoy it I think it works great
and it could have multiple uses in your
collection as well but for applying on
other people I especially love it for
foundation all right so we are moving on
to concealer brushes and for myself
personally I do not use brushes I use a
Beauty Blender so this is my dirty
Beauty Blender any type of nice sponge I
just enjoy how that makes the under eye
look so that's what I do on myself but
on my clients I do tend to use brushes
and I use fluffy blending brushes I'm
sorry for any crazy noises outside this
is something that I also like to use in
the crease of the eye on myself
personally what you'll see later on but
on people for the under eye and just any
real area unless it's like a super
targeted one then I'll use something
like a lip brush I just like something
that's going to again be kind of
airbrushed and light a lot of the work
that I'm doing I'm not necessarily
applying a ton of product especially
with men's grooming I want it to be as
light and natural as possible I am just
refining the skin I'm basically being a
version of like airbrush or Photoshop
for them like trying to just get rid of
any little imperfections but they still
look like them you know so I do like
using these this is just some eBay brush
honestly guys like any fluffy blending
brush that you see people using the
crease you could totally use
then this it's like a Coastal Scents
2:17 doop I've had this for ever I've
had this for like five plus years so um
yeah that's what I like to use for
concealer on my clients all right next
we're moving on to powder brushes and
I'm basically on this side or this side
there's like no in between for me so for
me a classic powder brush that I like to
use is something like this
I don't really prefer the bigger rounded
brushes instead I prefer something that
has a pinched ferrule so this almost
looks like a big old paddle super soft
super fluffy this is the Sigma F 20
brush and then this is a very similar
brush it's just a bit smaller in size
and this is the elf complexion brush and
these are just really nice powder
brushes I enjoy both of them obviously
there's a bit of a price difference with
them so maybe you could try this one see
if you like it and then this one is
definitely gonna last you a bit longer
like this one the ferrule is coming and
done and whatnot but I do enjoy elf
brushes for what they are so that is the
first type of powder brush that I like
this is kind of more of a classic style
I also like a tapered powder brush so
this is from Kat Von D this is the
number 20 brush I got this sent to me
from Influenster and it's really nice
this is so soft I love using this on my
clients this isn't my kit it's so very
soft it's the softest brush in this
style you'll see more because I also
like to use this brush for bronzer but
this is a great one for powder I love
that you can kind of get targeted areas
but you can also get bigger areas
because it is still a big fluffy brush
so this is another one that's a great
option for powder and then we have
smaller brushes so these ones I like to
use to powder under the eye but also
again for the whole face if I'm working
on a client or even myself this is the
powder brush I use every single day from
ELF this is actually their blush brush
but I use it for powder it works so
nicely under the eyes and then it works
nice just to like kind of lightly set
the rest of my face and then this one is
very similar it's pretty dense but this
is the contour brush from Real
Techniques I think this might be like a
dupe version of it though I don't know
if this is the actual version of that
brush and I use this in a very similar
way on clients for under the eye as well
as the rest of the face if I really want
to target certain areas or make sure I'm
really setting the face well with powder
all over now
let's move on to bronzer so I kind of
give you a spoiler with that Kat Von D
brush in my kit I use that for powder
but also bronzer I love the way that
tapered brushes apply bronzer there's
something about the way that they can
get on the hairline they can also kind
of like give you some precision blending
onto the cheek and under the jawline but
they still can blend at the same time so
I really love that about them this is my
next favorite when it comes to the
tapered brushes that I've tried
obviously the Kat Von D one is amazing
but it is a bit expensive this one is
from that Coastal Scents set and I think
that it's like I think it's like
nineteen dollars at the max unless it's
on like a sale you can even get it
cheaper but it's $19 for a set of like
eight or ten or something and this is
one of them in there I love this I think
it's worth the price for this brush and
a couple other ones that you get in
there even if you don't like the other
ones so I really enjoy this brush and if
you want another option this one is from
ELF and this is the pointed powder brush
very very similar
this one isn't quite as floppy as the
other two and that's something I like
about those ones but this one's still
really great it's not too dense but it
just has a little bit of something
different to it I like that one as well
for contouring I honestly don't contour
a ton in my kit or even here I mean I
just do light sculpting of the face I
don't ever go in with a harsh line or
anything like that but some brushes you
can do that with this is an angled brush
this one looks like it might be a little
bit fat but I think it's nice definitely
from like back here you can just kind of
Pat product on and then blend it out so
that's what I like to use that for just
kind of building up a base at the back
of the ear and then slowly blending it
out as you have less product on your
cheek this one is from that Coastal
Scents set and then this is one of the
brushes that I use for powder but again
you can use this for contour as well
next let's talk about blush brushes I'm
I'm a simple girl I just like an angled
freaking brush for blushes this is what
I've been doing forever I mean I always
have applied my blush with a angled
brush so the first one here is the one
I've had the while I've had both of
these a really long time but I would say
maybe this one the longest this is from
Coastal Scents
I bought this years years years years
ago this is the one that's in my kit
I love how an angled brush applies blush
I like that angle on the cheek I think
it just helps blend the product really
well it's not too big it's not too small
I really enjoy this one and then this
one is basically the same thing it's
maybe a little bit wider but I mean it's
an angled blush brush but this one's
technically called the Sigma large
angled contour f40 so that's what I like
to do for my blush I keep it pretty
simple when it comes to that
for highlighter I honestly almost never
apply highlighter in my actual like
makeup gigs unless I'm doing something
for like a glam shoot I I mean I just
never apply highlighter with what I'm
doing like you would just see that on
the skin it just would look so bad in
movies and just different things that I
work on so I really only have options
that I use on myself but I like a small
tapered dense brush for that this is my
favorite this is the actual contour
brush from Real Techniques and this is
what I use on my highlight every single
day I love it so so much this is a very
similar brush and it's a little bit
bigger but you can do the exact same
thing with it this is a brush that again
that's really cheap from doe color
I believe they sent some brushes out to
me and I think they're pretty nice I
think this like brush set is $12 for a
bunch of different brushes so I
definitely like that but I I do prefer
like a tapered brush for that I really
like a brush I want to try so bad as to
Anastacio a highlighting brush that's
like on my list of like high-end brushes
I'd want to try but yeah I don't really
prefer a fan brush those are not my
favorite unless it's like a bigger
thicker one those can be nice to
highlight with and those can be nice to
actually like kind of contour and sculpt
with as well with bronzer we've gone to
the eyes and this is a lot of freaking
brushes to talk about a lot of these are
in a very similar category but I just
want to give you guys options about
different ones that I like all of these
brushes I suggest so yeah let's get into
the eye brushes I'm gonna break it down
by how I apply eyeshadow so we have a
little bit of order to this part of the
video but we'll see all right so the
first brushes that I like to use for my
eyes is something to basically set my
primer for me this is a brush that
basically never sees any other color but
a light matte cream shade or whatever's
close to over skin tone I'm working on
so I have the
when you're from Coastal Scents it's
like I don't even know if they have this
brush anymore it's just it's massive
when you think of how big this is on the
eye it just sets the area and does it
fast this is also from Coastal Scents
again from that kit and this is a bit
more dense but it's still very big I
could never apply like eyeshadow or
anything like that with it and so these
are the type of brushes I like there are
so many different brushes you could do
this with I do like something that's in
between fluffy though and not something
that's too stiff next on the list we're
talking about the fluffy blending
brushes these are brushes that you
always hear us talking about people on
YouTube you see them like blending
things out into the crease these are one
of my favorite products I could do
almost a whole I look like a simple I
look with just these types of products
so first off my number one favorite the
e-40 from Sigma I've had this brush for
years and years and years and years and
years and years and years and I love it
so so much I do not like to use this on
clients I like to use smaller brushes on
clients that seems to be the trend that
I've noticed is that when I work on
other people I like more detailed and
precision brushes whereas when I work on
myself I do like a bigger brush or I
just you know have a little bit more
freedom to be a little bit more wild and
crazy' so I love using blending brushes
fluffy blending brushes so I have three
of the e 40's this is the e 40 that you
would get if you just bought it alone
and this is the e 40 I bought in a kit
so highly suggest this brush you will
love it you will use it forever next
though I do have some other options this
one's from colour-pop this is pretty
inexpensive I think it retails for $5
and this is nice I do like this I kind
of use this as a secondary crease brush
because it is a little bit more dense
than the f40 which is what I'm used to
but you definitely could just use this
you don't have to that's just you know
my routine and what I've become
accustomed to but this is a really nice
brush especially for the price these
ones are very similar one is from Soho I
don't even know if you can buy this
I got it sent to me in like an Ipsy a
long time ago and then I bought one like
on clearance at Walgreens like forever
ago so this is a nice one as well it has
like an ergonomic alhamdulillah
not but again that nice fluffy blending
brush shape
it's like tapered at the bottom and then
just like flutes out and then the last
one I have here is from Wet n Wild and
this is the p20 this is part of their
like newer brushes and I really enjoy
this I think this is a very very nice
brush I don't know why mine's like
turning gray I need to wash it and see
if it's just shadow or what but I do
really like this this tends to be a
little bit more tapered than the other
ones it's not so like fanned out but I
still enjoy this I think it works very
very well so this one is probably the
easiest and most readily available if
you were just gonna like pop in
somewhere I think you could get this at
like wherever they sell wet and wild I
think but I did get mine from online now
moving on from that we have the smaller
blending brush these are very very
similar
but they're just a teensy bit tinier and
these are gonna give you a little bit
more precision to blend like a second
color into the crease to deepen up your
outer corner or whatever you want to do
without blending your color all the way
into where you originally set your first
transition or whatever you did so I
really like all of these this one from
elf is great this is the crease brush
and this is great for getting like in
the inner corner and blending again
adding some color on the outer corner so
I love that brush I have one here that
I've had for a long time this came with
my naked 2 palette and I love the brush
on the end again for those exact same
reasons it's just a smaller blending
brush I have a more pointed one although
the cut on this is pretty bad this is
from Coastal Scents again a long time
ago I made a pretty big order like
little I would say five years ago and
again another one from that dough color
set and this is very nice and small and
can get into the crease how it's just
having like a secondary smaller blending
crease brush next we're still blending
but these are a bit different I like to
call these my Mac 217 or similar brushes
so this is that Coastal Scents one that
I talked about earlier that's a dupe for
it this is I don't have the number but
again oh the 250 I'll have everything
linked though and this is great for
applying shadow and having precision but
again you can blend out so I've
we really like this especially for like
any outer corner work you want to do I
have two that are kind of similar from
colour-pop these ones don't taper in as
much at the bottom and they don't taper
in as much at the top but I do find that
they work very similarly I got these
when they first released their brushes
and I don't know if they have these
available but that's a similar shape in
case you have that this is another brush
very similar to those shapes from Real
Techniques I don't know I think it's
just the crease brush blending crease
brush something like that and then this
one is very similar to the two here from
colour-pop but this is from that Coastal
Scents again kit so these I mean they
look like identical brushes to me I love
those again just for a little bit more
precision for applying color but you can
still blend it out really easily I'm all
about keeping it pretty simple when it
comes to eye looks and brushes like I
don't usually use a ton of different
brushes on myself or even on other
people so those three brushes can get
you so far
next I want to talk about some brushes
you can use for the lid I use my fingers
for a lot of shimmery colors on the lid
that's just my preference but on other
people I like to use a flat stiff shader
brush this is from colour-pop but you
could use any one that's like this even
the other end of this Urban Decay brush
it's gonna give you a very similar look
and you can let this and then apply your
shadow and just doing that with a stiff
brush is going to give you a denser
pigmentation on the lid so that's what I
suggest I'm not sure if you can get that
one from colour-pop but again I will try
to link everything I can I feel like it
looks a lot more pink I had to like read
I had to change out my card so if it
looks different that's why but if you
want a softer look to your lid this is a
really nice one this is the elf
eyeshadow brush this is I think a dollar
and I really like it
I mean it's not like the best but I
think for a dollar it's really really
awesome I also really like using this on
the bottom lash line to really like
smudge out and put down your base shadow
for blending out the lower lash line so
this is an amazing brush for a dollar
it's an other random like eyeshadow
brushes for your top lid that I thought
I would just mention I have two that are
very similar this is like what I
consider a Stamper brush so if you want
to like just stamp on some product it
has an angle but it's really fat and
that's how I use these product so if I'm
really trying to punch in some color and
then I'll go in with one of those other
brushes and kind of blend out the edges
that's how I like to use these I don't
use them all the time but I do find them
handy and useful one of them again it's
from Coastal Scents some of these
brushes I swear to have had so long and
I've just used on forever but the other
ones from royal and langnickel and it's
the angled blender bmp-1 57 so I really
do think you could find some of these
brushes though either in your collection
or from other brands and then the last
brush for kind of like shadow on the
upper eyelid this is the medium angled
shading brush from Sigma the e 70 and
this is newer to me but I really do like
applying product with this if you're
trying to do a wing and you just want to
be able to place product this does it
for you because it's angled and long
like that so I just think that's like a
really helpful handy thing you can also
blend out the bottom lashline with this
as well but I do think that's something
that's really handy for it I think we
got something similar to this in our
boxycharm this one is the vintage
cosmetic company so you could definitely
do something similar with this one it's
a little bit fatter but I mean it's a
very similar similar situation now to me
this next category is the most important
and this is liner brushes it is
difficult to get a good wing liner
unless you have a good liner brush so I
suggest you invest especially if you're
working on other people that's something
that I didn't realize I even needed as
much as I did until I started it's like
you can't get a really nice flick unless
you've got a good brush so the first one
here and the most affordable one I
believe is from colour-pop this is the
angled liner brush J kissa talks about
this all the time so that's why I wanted
to pick it up and it's great it's so
just thin and precise you really can get
a nice line with it and I love that it's
so affordable next I have a very small
winged liner brush from Sigma this is
the winged liner o six I love this if
you have really hooded eyes really small
eyes this is going to be great you can
just you know do very fine lines with
this and I love that about it and then
the one that I have in my kit is from
deleon to land it's the 762 brush again
it's just an angled liner brush you
could use these for the brows but I do
have a specific brow brush that I liked
I do truly like these just for like
liner application whether it's with a
shadow or with a gel liner I
accidentally forgot to mention this
brush but this is from Coastal Scents
again from that kit but this is a really
really nice one for getting a shadow on
your lid so if you aren't doing
something that's super like stiff and
long when it comes to shadow this is a
nice one I love for my hooded eyes how
small and tiny this is I can take my
time really packing on shadow whether
it's on a sticky base or whatever I'm
doing so I really like that I think
sometimes you know we get a lot of big
brushes which I do I love the fluffy
blending but when you're doing more
detailed work it's nice to have a
detailed brush I guess I'll talk about
the brow brush that I have this is from
Coastal Scents and it's super old so old
I'm telling you all my brushes are like
just these chibi brushes that's what I
like guys that's what I use so this one
is pretty old I hope they have it on the
site still I don't have a number on it
like I've had this so long when I used
to fill in my eyebrows with powder this
is what I used and I loved it because
it's a very stiff short brush it's not a
really fluffy to thin of an angle and I
liked that because I could just it was
just faster I felt like the regular
angled brushes that are great for a
liner they just don't work well to me
for powder unless you're doing something
very specific so I love this brush I do
suggest just something with just a
little bit more of a grit this is like a
very coarse hair compared to the other
brushes that I showed with an angle so I
love that brush for the inner corner I
love a good pencil brush I just love
them I think they work so so well so
that's what I suggest these are both
from Sigma they have a pencil e30 but
any pencil brush will do I love that you
can get them on the inner corner and
kind of blend out as well so that's what
I use a pencil brush for and I use that
like every day on myself I wanted to go
back and visit the lower lash line
before we move on to lips and then we'll
be done guys we're so close I have two
different types of brushes here this one
is from Real Techniques and it's the
brow brush this is way too big for brows
you would it would be so not good if you
use this in your brows but for
underneath the lash line I like it
because you can apply product and also
blend it out pretty nicely this isn't
going to give you a really precise line
but I do like it for
blending and applying and then for my
more precise type of line underneath
this is a Coastal Scents 253 brush again
I've had this for forever and I like to
apply this right next to the lash line
and you know you can't blend out too
much and it's a little scratchy probably
not the best brush but it's what I have
it's what I use so anything like this
even the ones that have like that aren't
curved and are just like straight out
those would work well too but I do like
the curve it just helps with blending a
little bit better and last we have lip
brushes which I don't use lip brushes on
myself I don't need to but in my kit
these are the two I use the most
I love the Real Techniques one this is
their detail brush so you can use it for
a bunch of things but I find it works
just so nicely for the lips you could
use it on the eyes though since it is a
kind of like flat shader brush type of
style but again lips so great I have two
and then the other one I have here is
the Sigma shader lid brush it's the e 56
it's just a sample I think I got this as
a sample from IMAX like a couple years
ago and I love this for the lips as well
it has a you know rounded edge which I
think is nice just to you know have some
nice precision and get some nice lining
of the lips without like going over so I
love this for lips and that's what I use
it for and I think those are all the
brushes guys I know it was a lot I hope
you guys enjoyed I hope you guys got to
see the detail but I think it's not only
about having these exact brushes or you
know someone else's exact brushes it's
about learning what you prefer and what
kind of eye shapes you like playing with
different densities and shapes and sizes
and really honing in on what you can
create with different shapes and the
only way you can do that is with testing
out brushes and doing different I looks
and different things like that so I hope
this helped you I hope you enjoyed I
know that a lot of these were coastal
signs but like that's just me man I'm
just a cheap girl I like some cheap
brushes alright guys let me know if you
have any brushes you think I would love
in the comments that would be amazing
and that's everything thank you so so
much for watching guys I'll see you in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
