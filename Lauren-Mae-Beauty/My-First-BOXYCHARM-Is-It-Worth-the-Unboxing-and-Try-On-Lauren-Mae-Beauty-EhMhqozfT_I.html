Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going a little chill I have
no makeup on my face because we're gonna
be putting on some makeup in this video
my hair is doing its own little thing
it's having a moment but I just wanted
to be chill today and hang out with you
guys and I'm super excited for this
video because it's going to be an
unboxing and Tryon because I did it I
bought boxycharm guys so yeah I have my
first boxycharm that I've ever received
ever here just you guys know I paid for
this myself if you guys have watched my
makeup wishlist videos I mentioned in my
most recent one that I was looking into
getting a subscription box and I was
pretty sure box t-turn was the one I
wanted to go with because you do get
four to five full-size products for
twenty $1.99 a month
it was between this and basically this
is a 401 but I just don't want to get
like foil samples or anything like that
so I thought it would just double the
amount of money I'm spending try out
boxycharm see how it goes I haven't
gotten a subscription box in a very long
time I used to get birch box I used to
get Beauty army do you guys remember
that I remember Elle Fowler talked about
that so I had Beauty Army for a while I
did it see for a little bit and then I
even did PopSugar for a while so I've
had and I got a wantable box once too so
I used to be really into them and then I
kind of stopped when I was trying to not
bring makeup into my collection so if
you're someone who's trying to cut down
on your collection definitely cutting
out a subscription box is going to help
you're spending money every single month
and you are also bringing in new
products every single money no matter if
you want them or not so if that's
something that's a goal of yours I would
stop doing that but I'm at the point
right now where I just wanted to have
something fun and this is definitely a
fun way to get surprised makeup in the
mail for me what's important in the
subscription box is the value so I
picked boxycharm based off the value the
fact that I was getting full-size
products for basically like $20 a month
I thought was really awesome and there's
something so fun about the surprise of
not knowing what you're gonna get so I
don't know how long I'm gonna skate with
boxycharm or how long I'm gonna do this
we'll see as the boxes go but I want to
unbox this with you I have not opened it
yet my sticker is still nice and sealed
but I just realized that I have two
stickers on one sticker and then I was
cut
and then another sticker put on top of
it so I don't know what that's about I
also don't know what month this is for I
don't know if this is for February or if
this is for March I have been watching
some unboxings and I'm sure the paper in
here will tell me if one month this is
for I was on a wait list for about a
week and then I got an email saying I'm
not on the wait list anymore so they
sent this out and I'm gonna stop talking
about it because I'm so excited to open
it up and show you guys what I got I'm
gonna be doing a full face using the
products that I have in here and then
going forward from here I'm going to be
doing a recap of the products I got the
month before in my next videos as we go
on so I can give you guys some reviews
talk about the new products show you the
new products and so on and have that
kind of be the cycle at least where as
long as I do this enough of the boring
stuff let's just get into the freaking
box I really hope I didn't show you guys
my freaking address I'm kind of like
wondering why it was open so okay I got
February I can already tell cuz I know
what everyone got okay so this is a
little card whatever I honestly don't
care if you've seen a million and
boxing's already for this month you
already know what we got the first thing
here are brushes which i think is super
exciting these are from crown it's the
3-piece pro brush trio I think these are
really cute I love the pink with the
white I do have a few crown brushes in
my collection off the bat these are
really soft
I just don't particularly love the shape
of these two like I think this one's
nice and I'm gonna definitely use that I
think it'd be great for like a little
bit of contour or even like a powder
brush or something this is just such a
basic brush we all have this the shape
is just like whatever mine are all like
a little bit deformed to which I don't
know if that's because of shipping and
then this one it's just like okay for
the shape but they're all soft I just
wonder how I'm gonna be able to work
these into my routine so I'm excited for
this I think this is a nice value they
say that that brush that retails for
$29.99 which is way too much running
next we have a product from cover
effects which is really exciting I know
this brand is crazy expensive if you
guys watching my video
talking about making prices I usually
always mention cover effects this is
their shimmervale which you can use I
think anywhere you want to let's see a
pearlescent cream perfect for eyelids
but can be used anywhere you want a veil
of shimmer this unparalleled buildable
formula feels weightless lasts all day
and won't crease or transfer I really
like the color that I got this is the
shade amethyst and it's beautiful a
little swatch of it it's definitely
sheer we'll see how buildable it is you
guys know I've been really into the
moonlight magic collection from
colour-pop and their supernova shadows I
also have the wet and wild ones so we'll
see how this compares to those because I
feel like it's kind of their version of
that but yeah that's an exciting one and
that product retails for $28 I think
that one is the best value so far out of
everything we've got in which I've only
showed you two things so you know next
is a product from pure I kind of thing
it's weird it's not in like a box or
anything but maybe they did that for
shipping because honestly this box was
really tiny when I got in the mail I was
like hey 5 or 4 full-size products
you're supposed to fit in there
but I guess all these were a little bit
tinier this month I feel like I've just
seen them bigger like the boxes are
bigger but I wonder if every month
depending on the products the box size
changes this is a product from shore
it's the EXIF oh oh I get an X fo lips
plumping lip exfoliator really exciting
you guys know I love lip balms and
treatments and scrubs so this is really
cool oh I'm just putting it on the back
of my hand currently oh yeah it
definitely has some grit to it I'm
excited to try that out this retails for
seventeen dollars which i think is a
pretty decent price for pure we have a
liner here this is vintage Cosmetics
smokey eye pencil it's supposedly
retails for 21 dollars
I like how I said I didn't care about
this which I didn't but I do want to
tell you this prices though I guess it
is nice this is in the shade jet-black
and yeah just like a black liner I
wouldn't say that jet-black is the best
term for it it's not as like creamy
pigmented as a lot of other brands
especially for the price point of $21
based off my initial swatches so we'll
see how that works into the routine
today and last year this is something
I'm actually really excited about from
the other video
I've seen this is from naked cosmetics
which is not a brand that gets a lot of
love but I do think people who have
gotten boxycharm in the past have gotten
products from them before this always
reminds me of the naked stacks like
those loose pigments anyway this is a
highlighting palette and it has just
some fun
iridescent colors which i think is so
cool this is their holographic
highlighter palette it retails for 39.99
which i think is very expensive it says
with six stunning holographic shades
this highlighting palette is essential
for any makeup enthusiasts each ear
doesn't shade is perfect for
highlighting and layering to transform
any look see I've just got one for like
two seconds
yeah it's right here literally at the
door I'm a great one what did you bring
in germ you little nasty there's another
one all right and he's already done so
that's the final product in the box for
this month to see you guys know the
theme was galaxy glow which I think that
some of these things work I feel like
basically two of these things are galaxy
glow the rest were just like random
products but that being said I'm excited
to try these out see how they work so
far first impressions like we're not at
this very moment with this box I'm
excited I think this is really nice for
me all this for $20 I still think is a
really good deal what I've purchased
anything in here probably not but I
still think it's fun and to me that's
where the value of this is to get like a
grab bag of fun things for a really good
price but other than that I'm gonna go
pick out some other products in my
collection so that I can do a face and
we will get into trying some of these
products out alright hi guys Henderson
really nice and close you can't even see
some of my chin I'm gonna be running
through my entire face in this portion
of it I want to keep this short and
simple but I also want to show you guys
what I'm doing so I'm going to just
speed up the parts where it's not like a
new product we're using and then I will
show you like in depth what we're
actually using from the box
we're finally onto the eyes I'm going to
be using the Smashbox ablaze palette
because I'm trying to use this quite a
bit the next two months I'm going in
with one of the brushes that crown
this is just like a flat fluffy shader
I'm going to take this shade here and
I'm going to be setting this all over
the lid and into the crease I'm just
kind of laying down a face shade to work
with so far it's it's fine it's just
like soft and whatever it's more my
issue with this brush is just this shape
I don't need anything quite like this
and this isn't a shape that I use really
in my everyday routine I'm more into
fluffy blending brushes or an actual
like flat shader brush like for
concealer or to lay down like a metallic
shade on the lid but it definitely is
nice and soft it's not scratchy at all
on the eyeball now that I have that down
as much - a fluffy blending brush just
to get some crease work in I am going to
be switching between this shade here and
the one I laid all over the lid I find
that this orange shade is just a little
too dark by itself so mixing them I'm
kind of creating my own custom
transition and I'm going to be putting
that all in the socket of the eye I did
this look actually yesterday for the
Oscars a very similar look at least and
I think it's gonna be really pretty with
that cream shadow on a lid and then to
pump up the darkness on the outer corner
I'm gonna be going in with just the warm
brown shade and the crown brush and I'm
gonna be just keeping this very close to
the outer edge and kind of close to the
lash line and blending out as we go up
I'm just building up some of that depth
on the outer corner
and then to deepen it up just a little
bit more I'm gonna take the darkest Matt
Brown in here just the tiniest bit and
I'm going to be adding this to the very
outer part of the eye
while I'm here I'm also going to run
some of this brown down on the lower
lash line with this brush
so my thoughts on this brush blended out
really nice I think it worked well I
used it for a lot of different things
and I can see myself using it again it's
definitely not a brush that I would
purchase the shape of this for but it
does make me interested in other crumb
brushes and like looking into brushes
that do suit what I want or what I'm
interested in because the quality was
nice next for the eyes we're gonna go in
with the cover effects I wanted to show
you guys though what the supernovae
shadow in over again looks like compared
to it so that's over again and then
that's the cover effects amethyst next
to it so it's basically like it's a very
similar shade I think but I feel like
the cover of x1 is a lot umm just more
Tang I guess it doesn't have like a
really like hot pink flash to it so
alright anyway we're gonna use this on
the eyes today I'm excited I've really
been enjoying the cream shadows and
we're gonna be putting this on the inner
corner and I'm gonna Pat out the edge
with my finger and I'm just going in
with the DOE foot beautiful okay I'm
obsessed already I'm super excited
all right so that is one layer of this
on the I'm gonna let it dry and I'm
going to do the other side and we will
come back and do a second layer because
I do want to see how this looks I will
say that this does go on more opaque
than I thought it was going to based off
the swatch like this watch makes it look
like okay it's kind of sheer but on the
eye I think it looks really beautiful
and I'm very happy with it so far
isn't that pretty I really really like
this I'm super surprised with this and
I'm really happy okay so that's two
layers of it on the eye
I'm just gonna let this dry I will say I
find that I enjoy one layer of these
types of products although I definitely
built up a little bit more opacity
definitely more in your face first
impressions I really like this product
this is a $28 product and it's something
that I probably wouldn't have bought
myself because I do have so many lower
cost affordable options to me but I love
it I'm really excited for it and I'm
glad that I can kind of compare it to
the other products and this makes up for
the price of the Box already on its own
so that's really exciting to me liner
we're gonna try out is the one we got in
the box this is the vintage one from
Jessica Libeskind and again it's in
black I'm just going to be tightlining
with this I'm gonna run this under my
lash line and I'm just kind of thicken
up the base of my lashes I don't usually
do a liner really so that's how I use
pencil liner so I'm glad it's a pencil
as opposed to a liquid but this is
definitely something I'm gonna have to
come back to you and let you know
basically like how it actually stays
here if it like gets in the inner corner
outer corner and all that stuff so I'll
be right back so you guys don't have to
see me be a demon so that is me with my
tight line done first impressions I will
say this is not the creamiest liner I've
ever used it's definitely not as like
slick as the urban decay and it doesn't
have as much pigmentation but I actually
do like it in its first application
because it actually like clings and I
don't know I just feel like I have a
little bit more control where sometimes
the really really soft liners can just
kind of go everywhere or feel messy so I
am excited to actually try this out I
will let you guys know my thoughts on it
in the next boxycharm video so this is
the aisle exhumed out super pretty super
fun really really happy with it I will
say I have a little bit of glitter
fallout from my eyelids but nothing too
much nothing that causes me too much
concern I'm gonna be going in with one
of the crown brushes and my butter
bronzer and I'm just going to be
bronzing my face like I normally would I
like kind of tapered brushes for
bronzing because you can kind of have
some more precise application but some
still blend ability my first thought
when I saw this in the package was to
use it as like a kind of contour type of
situation once again it's super soft and
it's like blending the product on nicely
um I prefer my ELF brush so far over
this as well as my Kat Von D one which
is similar those one's more expensive
than this one's less expensive than this
I just like the fluffiness this doesn't
quite have the fluffiness I think I'm
gonna just apply my blush with this as
well I'm using the part a blush from
Tarte and I wanted something matte
because we're gonna be going in with
those duo Crone's and I just didn't
clean my brush off at all I'm just
lightly going over at the cheeks with my
blush and now we're gonna highlight I'm
excited I feel like the to galaxy glow
products in here the ones I'm the most
excited for like the ones that actually
go with the theme so we're going in with
the Naked cosmetics highlighter palette
and the last brush we have to use the
only thing I could think to do with this
brush is do some highlighter with it
although it's not something I think is
gonna look that great first off these
are really pretty and although I have a
lot of duochrome metallic highlights I
think that these ones definitely have a
bit of a difference to it I will
definitely be testing that out with the
other ones in my collection and when we
come back I'll do some comparisons I
might even make that a separate video
than the other one because I feel like
these are just gonna get so long let me
know if you have a preference so for
today because my look is pretty pink and
purple I'm probably gonna be sticking to
this half of the palette this one is
someone calling my name although it is
the darkest it has the biggest I feel
like shift um first off I thought that
this is gonna kick up way more powder
than it does but it didn't so I'm going
to be using that on the cheekbone and
you immediately saw that purple shift
show through I don't think you can see
it until it hits the light
which is nice I think this would have
even been a nice color to put underneath
that cover effect shadow and then put
that one on top of it I think that would
have been nice I don't really like this
brush for highlighting but we're going
with it next I'm gonna take the other
purple and just kind of go over that one
I will say I think that one will be best
for like darker skin tones since it has
a little bit of a darker base to it
and it's not like horrible but I just
wanted something I think just something
a little bit lighter and brighter for me
personally and my skin tone is better
and then I decided I want to go in with
the lightest pink highlight from here
and just highlight my inner corner of my
eyes that was my favorite one so far I
feel like it has the pink but it's still
a little bright and the last thing we
have to do our lips so I already took
off my lip balm a while ago I'm gonna go
in with the pure product this is the
last product we have to use my voice is
cracking and I'm just gonna use this to
exfoliate it's leaving pretty big
granules like the granules are kind of
really scratching my lips I just licked
it a little it's very sweet has a like
vanilla taste to it I don't know if you
can eat this one so I'm not going to cuz
it's kind of suspended in like a balm
and I don't want to eat that that's for
the plumping claim on this I don't know
if it actually has anything to plump but
they do feel but my lips do feel a
little more plump but I feel like I feel
like that after I scrub them no matter
what so I'm like you know bringing blood
flow and kind of like you know hurting
them a little bit so there's like its
reaction I think this is nice but I
wouldn't buy it some of the the granules
are really hurting my lips like almost
scratching them and I don't know if
that's because it's in a very pointy
shape right now and as you wear it down
it'll be better I just think that the
elf one is very similar to this and I
like it better I will say I feel a
little bit of a minty tingling now hmm
okay a little interesting I'm also going
to spray my face with the setting spray
just to see how the highlighter looks
with this on it got something I've been
doing recently and I feel like it does
change the look of a highlighter so
we'll see if that had any effect so now
that we have a face done I want to go
over and just give you like a quick yes
or no an over review of the books when
it comes to the brushes I
like these two this is probably my
favorite one I think I'll get use out of
it this one is fine I just don't like
the shape and then this one I don't like
really at all I don't like the shape I
didn't like it for highlighting I'm
gonna try other ways but it's definitely
one I can see myself decluttering my
absolute favorite product in this box
something that I'm excited to have in my
collection potentially makes me want to
look at these products as they come out
in the future is the cover FX one I just
love it it does say not for resale on
the back I don't know if that means this
isn't a full size but I'm pretty sure it
is anyway I think it looks great on the
eyes it's so fun it actually falls in
line with the theme of the box which i
think is cool just really great great
quality to brand I know and a brand that
I'm interested in trying the naked
Cosmetics palette I think this is nice
there's no way that this should be
priced at $40 for how much product
you're getting you can get the moonchild
palette for that price and you get so
much more product I just like those
better out of the three that I tried
today the lighter pink ones my favorite
it has the least amount of shift to it
and I think that's why I like it I love
a dual chrome highlight but sometimes if
they flash too intensely I feel like it
can kind of like ruin your look or look
very over-the-top I like to try to wear
these types of products in an
interesting way that makes them look
fresh and fun but still beautiful and
these can look a little bit charactery
to me I'm gonna play around though I'm
excited to try out the other colors I
think they will work nicely as I shadow
so I'm gonna try that too not something
I would purchase it's a fun item but
it's okay yeah the pure product is
something I'm gonna try out and continue
using so I can give you guys a full-on
review of it it's not something I would
purchase especially for seventeen
dollars I think there are more
inexpensive things on the market and
it's just not like fun enough for me it
doesn't have a fun flavor it doesn't
have anything like cool about it Plus
this one kind of hurt a little bit so I
will continue to test it out it's not
something that I love and then this is
actually something I'm more excited
about than I thought it would be this
eyeliner is just a black whatever a
regular eyeliner but I like the
consistency of it way more than I
thought I would when it actually applies
on the eye again this is something I'll
have to test out longer though it's just
not worth the price I already know that
for sure but these two together make it
really worth it for me I can see myself
using these outside of the box outside
of ever
thing overall for my first boxycharm I'm
really excited about these products I
wish I hadn't seen other unboxings
because I already knew what I was kind
of getting once I saw initially what was
in there so I'm so excited for next
month to see what we get I feel like the
value and the Express and the products I
got this month definitely make it worth
it not all of them are winners but I'm
only spending $20.00 which is very
inexpensive compared to like one product
you could buy on the market and I want
that fun exciting you know newness
coming to my collection so I hope you
guys enjoy thank you so so much for
watching let me know if you guys enjoyed
this month's boxycharm box if you guys
have boxycharm and what's your favorite
thing you've ever gotten from the
boxycharm I'm excited to kind of feel
out what new brands I can try out and
what brands that maybe I know but I
would have never bought those products
I'm excited to see what comes in the
next couple of months so anyway that's
everything I'll stop rambling thank you
so so much for watching guys and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
