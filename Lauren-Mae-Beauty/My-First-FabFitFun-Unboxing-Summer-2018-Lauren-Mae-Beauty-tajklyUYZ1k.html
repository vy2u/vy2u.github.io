Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is a super exciting video for me
because I have actually partnered with a
fabfitfun
to open up at their summer box this is
the Summer 2018 box this is actually my
first sponsored video ever on the
channel so I want to say thank you guys
so much in advance for supporting me and
just supporting the channel I know that
without you guys I wouldn't get awesome
opportunities like this and I appreciate
you guys so as you guys are actually
seeing this video I am on my way to
Italy I know I talk about it all the
time I'm sorry guys but I'm hoping that
since this is a summer box I maybe can
find some items in here I haven't opened
this yet it's a complete just like
normal unboxing video if you guys are
new to fabfitfun it is a subscription
service that costs $49.99 a season but
every single box has at least 250
dollars worth of product in it so it is
a bit more expensive but you're getting
a lot of stuff they're all full-size
products and the box isn't just makeup
it is beauty lifestyle home goods like
it runs the gamut so I'm excited to see
what we get in here they also gave me a
code so you guys can save $10 off if you
want to sign up for the box so the code
is LMB it is not affiliated in the sense
that I don't make any money off of that
code I don't make a commission off of
each box if you guys sign up but if you
do want to say if you can use lmv to
save $10 off your first box I feel like
fabfitfun is one of those boxes that you
see a lot on social media and so when
they reached out I was really excited
cuz I had definitely heard of the brand
before I had seen a ton of unboxings and
since I have been really into
subscription boxes and just kind of the
mystery and fun of opening a box that's
been curated I was really excited to see
what was specifically in the summer box
so I'm going to just get into it let's
just open it up I've tried so hard to
not look at spoilers but I feel like
basically since I was like you know
looking at fabfitfun I did a little bit
of research before I agreed and
everything um yeah you know the cookies
on your computer like there every single
sponsored post on my Instagram was like
the fabfitfun box I'm like stop it I'm
like hurrying and scrolling so I don't
know what's in here and I've had to
avoid people in my subscription box too
like it's been a struggle I think I do
know a few things but something that's
new actually to faff is fun you should
just be one box that they sent out but
now they do let you customize some of
the things that are in your box so my
box could potentially
can be different than other people's
which would be kind of cool and
hopefully I get the good stuff I finally
got the tape open it kind of took a
while because I don't have scissors so I
had to be crafty this is huge this is
really really really big and the box is
so cute on the outside and then this is
what it looks like on the inside on the
top here we have a little magazine says
faff at fun I think this might be kind
of what it tells you each thing is yeah
it is so I'm gonna like put this inside
so we can keep the magic alive and then
we'll reference back to it as we open
things up after that's off you have this
nice tissue paper and there's this cute
freaking strawberry little sticker
holding it together okay so the first
thing is the biggest thing so the first
thing that I see in here is something
that says summer and rose and I was
literally at first being like oh my gosh
they send a blanket but I think this
might actually be a towel which makes
sense for summer that's something that I
really want to pay attention to with
this box is like how much of it's
actually summer themed because I think
that's really unique about this box is
that it is quarterly or like seasonally
sent out and it's kind of cool to like
potentially get some like new hot items
in your house for a certain season and
kind of like revamp stuff so this is it
I just like ripped off I'm just like
going for it they said something about
pineapple on the outside yeah it's a
towel okay so this is what it looks like
it has little pineapples and palm leaves
on it it's super cute and I'm pretty
sure I'm bringing this to Italy with me
as my towel which is awesome I will say
it's not like the thickest towel ever
like some beach towels are like thick
this is not like that but it's super
cute so we'll see how it does with the
water but I am excited it's it's really
really cute I love the pineapples let's
look at how much that cost so we can
kind of know the value as we go alright
the summer
Andros beach towel there were two
different options I kind of like the
other option better let me show you so
those are the two different options I
got the pineapple one but the other one
so cute so I'm so happy for everyone who
got that one but I still like mine I
just if I had to choose the other one
has pink in it death this retails for
$55 which is pretty expensive
never would have bought that so it's
kind of cool to get it in the box it
says that it is a microfiber towel so
the sand won't stick to it and that it's
not just for the beach you could also
use it for a picnic and stuff so I am
excited I feel like this box is gonna be
all the things that I want to buy for
myself but probably wouldn't have bought
for myself so we're already a fifth of
the way into the value for our box next
is a little box that says Pier one
Imports on it so I'm excited to see
what's in here oh it's so cute
okay so inside the box it's bubble
wrapped but it is this really cute
little marble jewelry tray so this is
something that would be great to have by
your bedside table I actually have
something like this by my bedside table
so I take off my earrings every single
night and my wedding ring and I put it
next to my bed so this is really cute
I'm gonna probably switch that one out
and try this one out I think the marble
is super trendy right now and it's cute
it's little as well you could probably
also put like a candle on this so let's
see what they actually say this thing is
alright so it says the Pier one Imports
marble ring dish I was I was on it on
the first one you can use it as a
catch-all for keys rings lives change
it's timeless marble design and golden
trim we'll glam up any part of your home
it retails for $14.99 which I actually
think is a fair price like $15 it's not
too expensive but it's not like super
cheap because it is still pure one so
I'm really happy with that I think it's
also another useful thing that I can
kind of use to upgrade something that I
already do in my home so far we're - / -
oh I like that
next is something that I did see the
sneak peek on and I was like what the
heck are you kidding me so this is the
luna foreo and I believe this is like a
face thing I don't know what ton about
this okay but I just knew that this was
exciting and it was an expensive little
tool that you use to clean your face I'm
definitely bringing this to Italy with
me and I'm definitely making my mom try
it as well
we're gonna read off the paper because I
don't know enough about it on its own I
need them to tell me what this is
because it's exciting yes but you're one
of the first to get your hands on four
iou's newest revolutionary advice oh
maybe it's different it's like tinier
but I feel like I've seen this before it
is powered by Bluetooth technology and
advanced skin sensors to create a
totally person I personalized profile
just sent straight to the newly-launched
foreo luna this retails for $89 avoid
clay or grainy cleansers as they may
damage the silicone touch points like I
said I feel like I've definitely seen
this before I cannot get it open for the
life of me I love how shiny it is and
I'm someone who probably would never
invest in something like this like ever
so it's really cool to get it in here
and just see if it's something that'll
like fit my routine or not so it came
with this little thing I'm not exactly
sure what that's for and then this is it
you guys okay how cool is this
so this is it and the silicone parts are
what you clean your face with it's super
soft oh it's it's on so it just like
vibrates and you clean your face it's so
cool I'm really really excited for this
I am going to turn this off so I can
talk to you guys I will definitely keep
you guys updated on how this goes
so definitely follow me on instagram
because i'm gonna be bringing this with
me to Italy and I'm going to be posting
on Instagram stories and I can keep you
guys updated that way in more live time
I am pre filming so I have videos going
up even while I'm gone but if you want
to be like more caught up with me in
real time definitely hit up my Instagram
this honestly is something I'm pretty
excited to try out and kind of like
figure out it feels like Christmas you
know when you get like electronics on
Christmas and you have to like charge em
and like read all the instructions and
you really just want to dig in but like
it really behooves you to like actually
do it right that's what I need to do
with this so $89 that's a huge value
let's keep going into the boxes there's
still a ton of stuff oh I'm so happy
let's get into the beauty hello this is
a beauty channel this is the Tartar
deist pro globe palette I'm so happy I
got this I did see this as spoilers
because you know my eyes like no makeup
so well so like I see a picture I'm like
well Zone in on the makeup like
immediately
oh no okay I'm a little scared mine has
like some powder on the outside
hopefully nothing is cracked please
don't be cracked oh I did have a bit of
a crack it's not too bad it's not not
nearly as bad as I thought it might be
this is the palette as you can see my
like second one down is a little bit
busted I'm a little bit sad about that
I'll have to go back now and like watch
other people's unboxings to see if that
was like a common thing or if I just
got unlucky this is a beauty item that I
would not purchase it's not a newer item
from Tarte they came out with this I
think last summer they did like a whole
trip and everything and they came out
with this as well as the pro palette for
the eyes so there was a lot of buzz
about it when it first came out and I'm
actually really excited to try it out
now since it's in the box I probably
would have never purchased this or gone
out of my way to get it other other than
getting it like randomly kind of like
this so it'll be cool to kind of like
see the formula I've wanted to try Tarte
highlighters that are like powder form
for a while so yeah this is an exciting
one and this is like a big palette it's
not just like something kind of dinky so
let's look I can't remember exactly how
much of that retails for it says it
retails for $45 and then just you guys
know the other thing you could have got
is the eyeshadow palette and I'm so glad
i got the contour there is just like so
much in here okay next i pulled out
something from Elemis it says it's the
papaya enzyme peel it's a cream
exfoliator I actually know about Elemis
because I used to work at a store that
we sold LMS products and I guess just a
little fun fact Elemis is on a lot of
like cruise ships I guess I know
interesting thing they're like in the
spas on cruise ships anyway
this retails for $45 it's a rinse off
cream to exfoliate using papaya and milk
proteins and moisturizing vitamin E to
leave your skin soft I am super excited
for this I will probably bring this on
my trip too and try it out with my mom
this would be a really fun box to like
either share with someone I feel like
and you guys can split up the products
or get together and you guys can like
try them out and it'd be like a fun
thing anyway the other thing that you
could get is a hair protectant treatment
spray so again I feel like I got really
lucky on this one about getting this
this is what I would prefer over the two
you get to select which one you want so
that is so awesome so I'm really happy
with this an LMS is a really expensive
branch so $45 is I know expensive but
definitely on point for their price
points I still have 3 things in here so
the next thing is a little like it
almost looks like jewelry or something
so let's check out what this even is
this is another one of the things that
you can pick like one or another thing
or another thing this is the earth to yl
ring I don't know if that's how you say
that it's a 14-karat gold plated ring
with to naturally cultured freshwater
pearl set in a classic and modern design
let's open it up I'm plus size so we'll
see if this little guy will fit my
fingers although it does have like an
open front so you know I feel like we
can we can make it work let's put it on
my pointer finger oh my gosh yeah I
definitely need to like expand this guy
in a second so this is something that
for me personally does not work out
because I just I have to like open it so
much guys I'm like a size 9 when it
comes to my ring like my wedding ring so
this is it I'm gonna pass that one on
for sure but I think it's cool that it's
actually like 14 karat gold and real
pearls so the next product in here
second to last this is a Vasanti
brighten up ends Maddock face
rejuvenator it's another exfoliating
cleanser so I got two in this box but if
you were actually selecting this
yourself because I didn't select this
they sent this out to me you would be
able to pick not this and like you could
choose if you wanted to pick one or both
of them it's essentially the same thing
so maybe I'll do like a battle between
them in Italy this retails for $29
though and it removes dead skin cells to
reveal as smooth even complexion and I'm
gonna have no skin on my face in Italy
I'm just gonna be exfoliating it away
alright and the last like product in
here is a sunscreen I got a little bit
beat up in there but this is something I
think is really important in a summer
box like it makes sense that a summer
box would have a sunscreen in it because
you're gonna be out in the Sun more and
this is a great way to try out like a
really expensive one this one's from
Kula it's SPF 50 and it's the sport one
and this is specifically for the face
which is so great it says this SPF 50
sunscreen doubles as a moisturizer it's
80 minute water resistant formula is
made with 70% organic ingredients so you
can splash swim and soak up the Sun
worryfree this retails for $32 and
you're supposed to apply it 15 minutes
before sun exposure I am bringing this
too I feel like that's really awesome
that's so many of these things will
actually work for my trip I feel like a
lot of people take trips in the
summertime and so it's cool that so many
of these
would actually like benefit you or could
fill in items that you might purchase
otherwise to prepare for a trip and last
there is a straw in here and it says on
here this straw saves marine life visit
give a sip us and I I don't know what
this is I'm gonna look on here and try
to find it because honestly oh here it
is this is one of the coolest things in
the box honestly to me I know that
sounds crazy because it's just a straw
but I read some more recently like how
many straws we use as Americans in a
year it's like mind-blowing and I am a
straw person I love straw so much and so
I've really been trying like when we go
out to eat whenever I'm at a restaurant
or whatever like I really try not to use
straws and try to like reduce it like
one straw at a time if I can because
these disposable plastic straws I mean
they just you use them for like not even
an hour and then they're in the
landfills and it's crazy it's so crazy
I'll try to put some like Statistics up
here so anyway let me read a little bit
about give a sip because I actually
would want to talk about this on my
platform it says give a sip a plastic
straw has a lot more impact than you
think
imagine a graceful sea otter it's
swimming through the ocean and it
mistakes a plastic straw for a delicious
meal the next thing you know the sea
otter accidentally ingests the plastic
and has a 50% chance of survival it's a
serious problem for the ocean the
wildlife and for us below we share other
issues our environment faces due to
plastic weighs more than 260 species of
wildlife have ingested plastic or have
become entangled in plastic debris by
2050 there will be more plastic in the
ocean by weight than fish and then it
says if current trends continue two
million metric tons of plastic waste
will be in landfills or in the natural
environment by 2050 well that makes you
a little sad doesn't it so um I think
that's really great and more than
anything my message to you guys is to
try not to use straws as much and as
often as you can or use paper straws
I personally literally hate the feeling
of paper straws in my mouth but I try to
for the animals man and for the
environment and just for our children
alright so that is my box that's the box
I got for the summer 2018 that's it fun
I'm gonna recap really fast and show you
some of my favorite items the things I'm
most excited to try obviously the beauty
stuff because I love makeup so much so
I'm definitely excited to try the Tarte
contour palette out and see if it'll
work for me
I'm pretty sure Nicole Renee Cutler
really loves this item so hopefully I
love it too I think next for me is the
face cleanser like tool the foreo luna
this is so cool I think it's awesome
that you get like a sneak peak and that
they have partnered with so many cool
brands and well-known brands like I've
heard of these brands before and outside
of this box which is something you don't
always get with boxes
I love the towel I love that I'm getting
a sunscreen and just in general all the
skin care products because I would never
buy those ones and I'd love to try them
out and see if they're awesome for me
the only thing that probably won't work
is this ring but that's just like a
personal preference it definitely would
still fit my finger it's just not
something I think I'm going to actually
wear so I think I'm gonna pass that on
and I think my mom will actually like it
so she's gonna get that overall though
I'm really excited about the Box I think
a lot of this stuff is great for summer
and I'm excited to bring it on my summer
vacation like I mentioned at the
beginning if you guys want to save $10
off your first box and try out the
summer one you can use my code LMP to
save some money let me know down below
if you've tried out that fit fun before
what your favorite item is if you've got
the summer box also let me know what
your favorite item you've ever gotten
from the box is if you've gotten it over
multiple seasons I would love to know
and to wrap it all up I want to say
thank you guys so much again for your
support and your love on this channel I
appreciate it so so much and thank you
to fasten fun for partnering with me I
will see you guys in my next video and
make sure to check me out on Instagram
and see what's happening in Italy I know
I'll stop with Italy but you're gonna
hear so much about it in my pre film
videos sorry guys I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
