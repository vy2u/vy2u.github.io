Lauren today I wanted to review for you
scent bird subscription service I feel
like I've seen a lot of videos with like
bigger youtubers talking about scent
bird so when I was contacted by the
company for them to send me a month free
I was excited to try it out and see what
it was all about and come back to you
guys with my honest thoughts and
opinions on it in no way is this video
sponsored I simply just got the first
month for free I just wanted to do like
a straight up video on it and not tuck
it into a perfume video or anything like
that so just let you guys know if you
haven't ever heard of scent bird which I
feel like if you again watch YouTube
you've probably heard of it
it is a scent subscription box you get
to pick the fragrance you want each
month for 1495 and you get 0.2 7 ounces
of fragrance they have a ton of
different options to choose from I think
they have like 450 or so so now that the
kind of like introduction to even what
separate is is out of the way let's talk
about how it came packaged this is the
package I received from them it's just a
bubble wrap package super small sleek
it's all black and then it does have a
cute little sticker I thought that was
kind of cute but overall I thought this
was like decent good packaging inside it
came with just a couple of things so
there are two cards I'll get to those in
a second but the big thing that we're
interested in is the scent bird actual
perfume samples so it came in this
really nice velvet pouch and I will say
that I felt this pouch was really good
quality I was honestly kind of surprised
feeling it I feel like this is something
that's usually just disposable so you
know you wouldn't think there'd be that
much quality or any time or care taken
into it but I really think it's nice it
feels luxurious and I do think it would
help to also keep the product safe so
anyway I thought I would just mention
that I think this is a nice little bag
and then it comes with the fragrance now
this one is a white case you do get a
complimentary white case for your first
month and then I believe after that they
just sends you the vial so as you saw
you just twist it up and then you're
able to just spray out some perfume and
then you can take this bottle out and it
has a little label on it I like that it
has like a professional label on this so
it's not just like some one hand rose
what is on here this is the vial so I
believe
after your first month you get sent just
the vile part and then you can just
watch out what you have in your little
case if you want other color cases you
can purchase them on the site if you
want to you that's not my style I would
never purchase more of these I would
just keep the one so that's this will
get more into this in a second but I
thought I would just mentioned the cards
really fast so it came with just two
cards in there this one's just talking
about separate in general and it shows
you how to use the bottle and how to
twist it up and everything so I just
thought that was nice because if you've
never used it before maybe that would be
you know something that's important to
know how to do I will say - I posted on
my Instagram a picture of like the
outside of it and someone mentioned that
their spray bottle like won't come out
or won't twist up or something if
there's an issue like that I mean this
is a really simple device to you so if
there is something like that happening
to yours definitely contact the company
and let them know that you have a
defective or a faulty one and they can
replace that for you yeah that's not
normal so you know it should be like
just as easy as I showed you to twist
and like pull up that's how easy it
should be for you just wanted to throw
that in and then the other card which I
thought was really cool is there a
fragrance of the month now this doesn't
mean that you're gonna get this
fragrance at all unless you choose it
which that's one of the great things
about this service is that you get to
choose what you're getting every month
instead of them just randomly sending
you some type of perfume the fragrance
for October is commodity gold I thought
it was just interesting because when I
was trying to pick the fragrance that I
wanted commodity was one of the brands I
was looking at and gold was one of the
ones I was also kind of thinking about
so I just thought it was interesting
that they kind of showcase a different
perfume the whole thing about the
subscription is that you get to try
fragrances that maybe you would have
never tried before or that you don't
want to invest a whole perfume bottle in
and so I just think it's nice that they
kind of can show you different suns and
it has like the key notes and stuff on
the back and you might want to add that
to your fragrance queue for the next
month so back to my perfumes
specifically I chose to get the Malon
and gets I think is how you pronounce it
Moroccan fig scent I really do like fig
suns and when I was looking online this
one just kind of reached out to me
and so it has a very fresh scent a lot
of people on the reviews section of the
site called it like a fresh-cut grass
I wouldn't say that to me it's more like
fresh wood but then at the end it has a
sweet fig type of scent and I really do
enjoy it I find that throughout the day
that kind of fresh wood or cut grass
scent kind of goes away and I'm left
with that sweet fig scent and I really
enjoyed it I just really liked this
fragrance it smells really good to me
and for a little bit of my scent palate
some of my favorite scents are Bulgari
omnia Coral
I really like Marc Jacobs Daisy I really
like eccentric molecule a one that's
like my favorite scent probably ever and
I really like Joe Malone
blackberry and bang I think it's what
it's called so those are just some of my
cents but overall I really do like this
scent which has nothing to do you pick
your own scent so I just thought I'd let
you guys know what I thought about the
actual scent I chose like I mentioned
before you get point two seven ounces of
product and I've had this not nearly a
month this is supposed to be a month's
worth of product in here now I am
notorious for just like you know
spraying myself down so for me this will
definitely not last a month I definitely
still think it's a good amount of
product enough for me to like smell it
on my skin know if I like it know if I'd
want to purchase the full size or not
but if you're someone who just likes to
like get down with the perfume it
definitely is not gonna last you a month
I think they say that you can spray like
three or four times a day and it'll last
you a month so I thought I would point
that out another thing that I really
like about this size and the price and
just everything about this is the fact
that you're getting about the size of a
rollerball for $15 which most roller
balls are about 22 like 30 and upwards
so you're getting it for a discount in
that way and I love that it's not in a
rollerball form I love that you can
spray it on your skin I don't really
like roller balls so that to me is a
positive let's see what else do I have
to say about this something that to me
is it's not negative because they have a
ton of options like I said they have
about 450 different options they have
more well known brands
some niche brands but I do wish they had
two brands in particular they don't have
a centric molecule which is one of again
my favorite scents and I wanted to try
like the other branch off versions from
the original and it would have been nice
to be able to do it through this service
so I wish they had that brand I also
would love for you guys to be able to
try it if you don't have a Barney's near
you which that's where that's one of the
places I know they sell it it's kind of
hard to like smell that so I wish that
it was branched out and that way and
just had even more brands I hope that
that's like something that they're doing
is constantly expanding and I don't know
how getting rights and stuff works but
um I wish that they had the centric
molecule so you guys could smell it
because I've talked about it I feel like
a little bit on my channel I also wish
that they had Joe Malone again it's a
more high-end brand you have to go to
like specific counters to smell it and
it would be nice to just kind of have
that and figure out if you like those
scents on your body for the price of
1495 for me specifically because I do
like more niche fragrances I feel like
my scent taste is a little more unique I
don't know I wish that they had at least
those two brands but I'm excited to try
other brands that I haven't heard of so
I'm thinking that if I continue the
service I'm gonna try some of the
commodity sense I also want to try Julie
it has a gun and just some of the other
scents that are on there that I haven't
heard much of there's still a lot to
choose from I just wish to have those
two brands I just wanted to say that I
really do hope that they're always like
expanding and hopefully one day they'll
have those as well I think that's
everything for my review I do have a
discount code I will leave it listed
down below it's L&amp;amp;B 25 it gives you 25%
off if you're a new member for your
first month subscription so if you were
interested in it you can definitely use
that code down below I get nothing from
it it just was something that they gave
me for my subscribers I'm sure you can
look around and find different codes too
if you aren't comfortable using mine or
you can just sign up and not use any
code whatever you want to do overall I
really do like this service I think it
makes sense perfumes can be really
pricey and it's nice that you get to
kind of try out a perfume before you buy
a full scent
whether you're indecisive or only like
things for a certain amount of time or
you want to change your scent up with
the season I think this makes a lot of
sense or
you're just trying to find your
signature scent that's kind of how I'm
using it is just trying to find the
scent that I really really like and
won't get tired of I wanted to mention
at the end here too that something I was
really pleasantly surprised about was
the fact that I just feel like it's like
a sturdy solid company I feel like
sometimes when you just hear about
companies through YouTube and like other
people who aren't exposed to YouTube
don't know about it I feel like the
companies can maybe feel a little shady
or Genki or just I don't know I I don't
want to sound negative to other YouTube
companies but I did really think that
like everything I got the package how it
was wrapped the sticker that they had
the velvet pouch just everything about
it just felt like a legit company like
it felt just nice it just felt good do
you know what I'm saying I also really
liked hearing from people in the
comments section of my picture that I
post on Instagram that they did get back
with them when they got like a faulty
sprayer and you know replaced it for
them no problem and that also just kind
of reassured me that I feel like this
company is actually the good solid
company so despite the fact that you may
have only seen sent bird things through
sponsored videos or whatnot
or because they're like promoting their
things out so that people like me can
test them and let you guys know about
them I feel like sometimes that can get
their name out there and that's awesome
but I feel like sometimes that can give
people like a negative taste or just
like oh do people just like it cuz they
get it for free but I do feel like
overall if you were to spend your
hard-earned money on this I feel like
you would be really happy with the
experience and everything about this
product I hope you guys enjoyed this
review although I got the product for
free it's a hundred percent my opinion
this is how I feel about this I feel
like this is a really good service it's
a great price and I love that you can
kind of switch out and pick your own
perfumes every single month I definitely
think that it has a place in the
subscription box world and that a lot of
people could get a lot of good use out
of it that's why review guys I hope you
enjoyed and I will see you in the next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
