is going to be my final gratis hall we
all know I quit my job and so I have
some stuff here it's my last bit of
stuff at least for now who knows in the
future but thought I would just show you
guys the final things I kind of got in
the last couple days in the last month
or so from work and let's do it and then
as i always do I kind of couple this
with my empties I don't know why they
just kind of get filmed on the same day
every month all this is it I have kind
of a lot of stuff that's collected a
couple things are like more random
gratis but yeah I'm not gonna explain my
grad asses if you want to I willing find
their videos down below I'm not gonna go
into it I refuse first off here i have
this orlane bronzer or lon bronzer I
actually didn't get this from work I
have a friend from makeup school who
went to like a like a demonstration type
of thing I don't know like kind of a
class and everyone went but I worked and
I couldn't but this bronzer is too light
for her it's basically like essentially
kind of her skin tone a little bit
darker but it doesn't do much so she
gave it to me so I'm really happy Thank
You Lupe I know you watch my videos so
girl what's up I'm actually did a video
once with her it was our like korean
food taste test I'll leave that link
down below if you guys want to check it
out me her and say I'm trying different
foods but anyway she gave me this so I'm
excited to try that out and see how I
like it lord knows I can't say no to
make up Lee are real estelle rep I was
able to pick out another product and
instead of picking my mascara which I
love I picked this just because it's
more useful and I actually go through
them so I did pick the real is still my
solar water this will be my third bottle
of this and I almost done with the one I
have and this will be my third one I
love this stuff it works really
similarly to buy derma or any of those
type of products I also like the simple
one and this is how I remember my eye
makeup so love this on my last day she
was there so she also gave me a mascara
it's not the lengthening one this is the
volumizing formula so I'm excited to try
this one out i'll show you what the
brush looks like it's just kind of more
of like a regular bristle brush I'm
going
obviously be using this soon since i
just opened it but i'm excited to try
this formula compared to the lengthening
although i just love to like anyone i
really loved that mascara so we'll see
how this compares this one's kind of
random this is a dior perfume this is oh
I'm like like that this is a Dior prefer
/ firm this is a dior perfume it's miss
dior cherie low it's le a you I actually
got this I did quite a few makeups for
halloween at work and this guy wanted me
to do the skull makeup on him and I was
like I don't know if I'll have time but
I fit him in anyway cuz he's very
persistent and he worked for Dior and he
brought me this is like a gift and then
he also tipped me which was awesome so I
got this and it actually smells quite
nice like it's definitely one I feel
like i'd pick out so it's very clean
kind of daisy ish like in the realm of
that so can't say no to that I was so
like you didn't have to do that that's
so sweet he was like no it's totally
awesome things so it was awesome we were
doing a long contest with you night at
work and each week if we sold unite
products we put her name in a raffle
basket and then someone would get picked
out and for four weeks we did that and
on the fourth week was the best one you
got kind of this like travel-size bag
with products in it I want it so this is
the unite mr. Eisen shampoo and
conditioner it came with these in it and
then I think it came with you did it
came with a full size of the detangler
which is like the seven seconds
detangler which is amazing i have a
small size but i gave that to lupe it's
fun to like share products and i
honestly didn't think i would use it but
it's super good and she said it's like
amazing too so if you need one that's a
really really good one but excited to
try these out I have had so many
shampoos lately so I'm really trying to
just like keep one going at a time I did
the kerastase review so i was using that
one a lot but i'm gonna tuck these away
until I need to use them like we need a
shampoo and conditioner just so that way
I don't have too many things going at
once random i got this brush from Numa
it's just like a wide tooth brush i
thought this would be good for just
combing my hair when it's wet and stuff
um but yeah i just have that talika came
in and trained us
they also let me pick two products but
with gratis you don't get your gratis
once you leave so if you leave and
things are still coming to you you just
don't get them which is so so so sad I
hate like this lip gloss is like oh all
over so if you saw any gross lip gloss
things I'm so sorry let me know if
there's more anyway talika came in so I
did pick two products but I didn't get
them in time with this she gave when she
actually trained us this is the bio
enzyme mask and Sakura fiying one I
haven't tried it's like a sheet mask I'm
excited too what they're really known
for is that they have I patches that are
like reusable I think that's probably
the biggest thing in known for but I'm
excited to try this and see how it works
i wish i got the serum and stuff that i
picked but that's a titans that's you
know it's better to be where I'm at now
then to have those I guess I got a
little Nick's mini set this has the
regenerating night cream as well as the
serum that detox serum that I really
love so excited to have more of that in
my life I really liked it and it's just
a cute little kit i am gonna use it i
was gonna like maybe gift it or
something but i'm just gonna keep it for
myself night creams are kind of hard for
me i just don't like buying skincare so
i know that i will get through these at
least eventually i have a few other
skincare type of minis i'm just going to
go if you're so so fast this is the
event clearance expert this is an
emulsion um i think that it is like a
cleanser it's much doubled blackheads
super small size i don't even know how I
got this this is the cool fix this is a
gel lotion to help treat ingrown hairs
razor bumps freezer burn and redness I
think that this is comparable to 10 skin
at least that's what I've heard but this
is cheaper so I don't really know how to
use 10 skin people came in looking for
that all the time it's quite expensive
like for the big big bottle it's like 60
something dollars at least at my work
which who knows they up the prices a lot
I'm excited to try this although I don't
really know quite how these work so if
you know how to use this if it
it's not like weird or like an
appropriate or like whatever let me come
the guns down below um I read you like
put it on after you shave I don't get it
I don't know anyway I'm excited to try
it and see if it helps although I guess
I don't really have an issue with that
but anyway I got that it was in my
locker when I got back from Peru I had
some down a logical stuff that I should
have gotten like back in August but it
took forever to get here and then when
it did kinda not all of it came so super
annoying that I earned those products
but this is one the only one that I was
able to get so this is the multi active
toner from dermalogica it's like a spray
toner and it's just the travel mini size
I'm excited to try this I've heard a lot
about it I think it's a you know great 1
i'm probably gonna use it to to like
help with like setting makeup toning the
skin before i do makeup toning the skin
before I like after cleansing before I
go on a boy stur Iser so yeah I'm
excited to have that and I've been going
through a lot of like spray type of
toners lately laughs this isn't skincare
its hair care but this is the gosh I'm
so sorry about that light this is the
bumble and bumble full potential Buster
spray I got another one of these for Sam
although he hasn't been using them that
I'm like use them they help keep your
hair anyway the rest is all makeup it's
all makeup stuff except for one nail
polish but that's close enough this is a
Deborah Lippmann nail polish this is a
tester and dream a little dream of me I
thought this was a pretty color it's
it's like a sheer pink with like a
purple sparkle in it I love getting
deborah lippmann polishes i think
they're super great i love that they're
like an eel treatment as well as a nail
polish so as you use these especially
with like project polishing and stuff
which I suck at suck but Heyman Hales
opinion right now I just like having
these new plushies I have so many now
because a friend gave me so many like he
brought Smee so many deborah lippmann
he's like oh you like them I have so
many I'm sure you got them as gratis on
like hmm I like almost 20 now I thought
this is a pretty one and Ingrid at work
was like oh I changed the Chester out
you can have it so I was like yeah
thanks last but not least i have 4 by
terry makeup items which by terry is a
very expensive brand these are all like
skin or foundation type products which
is really
exciting so I first picked up or took
when I change out the testers this one
is the highlighting concealer brush this
one is the to Shiva luta yes so although
this is a tester I'm just going to clean
the brush and make sure no products in
there and then when I push up new
product it'll be totally fine and clean
so I'm excited to try this out their
products are seriously so so good so
luxurious I'm excited to try like actual
face products not just like lip products
from them I also got a primer this one
is the hyaluronic hydra primer I think
this is a cool idea so I'm excited
there's not a ton in here I mean I i
don't know i think there might be this
much in here because i was like changing
out the tester but i'm excited to try
that the last two products this is the
by Thierry CC cream and this one is in
number one I tried this a couple times
actually already and I'm not sure how I
like it it just is so sure I mean it's
like just a lotion to me so I'm gonna
use it up for sure even if I just use it
as like a lotion to moisturize before I
go on a foundation but yeah this is I've
only heard amazing things about it what
I love about this is all these things
are so sanitary because their pumps and
squeeze tubes I've taken some things
which I'm just gonna get rid of that I
just don't feel comfortable using
because it's just not quite sanitary
like mmm that's iffy and then i find i
took it being like i'll try to make it
work and then in my collection like
creeped out more than anything so these
i'm so excited that i actually like
there's no way these are tainted which
is awesome I got that and then the last
thing i got was the terribly dense
illest and cilia Milus I don't know it's
their serum foundation this is a hundred
and fifteen dollars at least at my work
hundred and fifteen dollars for this
foundation so i have about like over
half of it left i'm excited this is in
the color for natural beige I'm just
excited to try this foundation out for
myself see how I like it since it is
such an expensive product that's
everything that's all the gratis I gods
and it's my last one I hope you guys
