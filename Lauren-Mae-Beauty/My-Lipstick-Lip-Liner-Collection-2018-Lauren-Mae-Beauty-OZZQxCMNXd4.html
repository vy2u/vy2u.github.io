Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be continuing on
with my collection series I started this
with lip balm so I'm going to leave that
link down below I am excited to do this
in kind of micro sessions because I
think this is gonna be a great time for
me to really reflect on the items that I
have in my collection and really
appreciate them and if not I can always
declutter them too and figure out that
they're not working for me but anyway
this is going to be lipsticks and lip
liners and then my next one is going to
be lip glosses and liquid lipsticks I
mean that will cover all of my lip
products but anyway let's just get into
it you will notice that I have a very
specific type of lipstick that I like
and they are going to be anything in
like a pencil form like these NARS ones
you probably saw from the thumbnail that
I do have a lot of the pencil form
that's how I like my lipsticks and over
the years I have just figured out that
that's what I actually end up using and
so that's what a lot of my collection is
I feel like my lip collection is pretty
minimal at least for me but yeah let's
just get into it we're gonna start with
the NARS products here
NARS has two different formulas one is
the satin lip pencil and one is the
Velvet Matte lip pencil so I have one of
these satins this one here is in the
shade torres del paine and this was
limited edition it's a really pretty
just peachy color
I like this it does have a bit of a
sheen to it and I like that it's not
super opaque the next one here is in the
shade patina and this one's really nice
this is part of the matte formula and my
stuff might actually be kind of dirty
because I do wear it so that is patina
right there it's really nice new this
next one is in the shade IB Rako and
again this is part of that limited
edition collection this is one of my
absolute favorite colors of lipstick
that I own I love this like hot orange
red color especially in the summer with
a really minimal I like just some nice
mascara or maybe like a liner like a
winged liner I think it looks
really pretty and fresh and I love that
it's a matte formula and the last one
that I have here is the shade let's go
crazy this I got as a hundred point perk
and it's a really pretty pink so that is
the shade let's go crazy and those are
all of the different NARS lip pencils
that I own next I want to show you guys
my buxom lip pencils these are my
absolute favorite lipsticks that I have
in my collection these in the nards are
pretty tight but this line has my
all-time favorite shade and formula so
that's why it wins but overall I really
really love these obviously and I have
quite a few of them two of them are more
recent this is one of the more recent
ones this is the shade Barcelona I'm
sorry my swatches are so weird it's
because i'm swatching using my left hand
on my right hand so yeah that's the
shade Barcelona it's really pretty red
next here this is the shade San
Francisco it's a really pretty oh my
gosh this is probably gonna irritate so
many of you it's gonna Garrett ate me
this is a very beautiful just you know
kind of mommy nude shade this is another
one of my more recent shades this is the
shade Amsterdam and that one's more of a
peachy nude this next shade is my
absolute favorite one this is the shade
dolly I've actually used up a full one
of these before and then that is a
backup of it actually this is just my
perfect like my lips but better shade I
absolutely love it it's like the perfect
Bobby
nude on me and I love it it's not too
warm it's not too cool it's perfect and
the last one I have here is the shade
Sydney it's actually rubbed off because
I've had it that long it is my oldest
one and this is also the lightest nude I
have from them it's really pretty I just
don't tend to wear colors that nude very
often but I do really like it still and
those are all of my buxom lipsticks so
next I have all of my nude sticks I have
quite a few here and I'm gonna actually
switch it up and starts watching them on
this hand but I have quite a few some of
them are different formulas so I'm just
going to get through them I do
like these I think they're really nice
again they're in that pen form and I
love that the first couple I'm gonna
swatch here actually I bought in a set
so I will leave that link down below as
well as everything here this is the
shade Sonoran and it's a brown nude and
this is their formula that dries like a
liquid lipstick on the lips it's a
really cool formula and I do enjoy it
it's a little drying but I do prefer
this over a lot of liquid lipsticks
sorry this one's a little dirty but this
one is the shade freckle it's a red
Brown and I love that one this next one
in that set is called go girl
it's a nice peachy nude the darkest one
from that set is called Joyce and it's a
nice like brown dark nude it almost
seems a little purple to me too the next
year to have here is baby Kay again it's
still part of that set it came with six
different colors it was like a collab
with a bunch of different influencers
it's kind of like a subdued burnt Coral
I really like it it's pretty in the last
shade from that set is called Montaigne
and this is a really beautiful cool
toned and nude I really like that one
it's one of my favorites from the set as
well the last three that I have here are
all a part of the lip and cheek pencils
so these you can use on the lips and
cheeks they don't dry down like the
other ones they are more of a creamy
moisturizing formula this is the shade
sole it's a really pretty warm nude they
have some really beautiful nudes in this
range I highly suggest them I really
love the shade mystic that's my number
one favorite I had it in my makeup kit
and I used it all the way up the next
one here is a nude that's not messing
around this is the shade flesh and it's
one of my lightest nude shades it's
great to put on in the middle to kind of
like highlight a color or lighten it up
but it's very very nude and last I have
the shade whisper which is also quite
nude but it's more cool toned obviously
not nearly as light as the other one but
it's a it's really really pretty again I
highly suggest the nude sticks formula I
think they're really really great so the
next brand of lip pencils that I have
here are from lorac these are the lorac
Mac Pro lipsticks I believe I really do
like these they don't get that much love
I don't know why they
on YouTube but they don't I did actually
do clutter these white ones in the past
and I wanted to D pop them and put them
in my kit because they were just colors
that I knew I wasn't gonna reach for and
I have not gotten around to doing that
so I'm going to show you what I have
regardless but this is really the only
one that I use really so yeah let's just
get into that all of these white ones
were also in a limited edition set so
you cannot get these colors but this is
the shade autumn and it's a burnt like
kind of coral a nude this next pink one
is in the shade italian rose and that
one's quite right i felt like these
didn't really match the colors i thought
i was going to be getting and that was
kind of disappointing with these
specifically in the last shade from that
set is burgundy wine and it's a really
pretty darker red and the one that I
actually really like and I love the
color of is the shade pink taupe and I
think this is really really beautiful
it's pretty similar to the shade dolly
but in formula I do prefer the buxom so
those are all in my lorac pro matte
lipsticks so I accidentally swatched all
of these without you seeing so let me
show you all the colors this one here is
the shade sweet cream and it is the
first one here a pretty coral the next
lipstick is the shade honeycomb and it
is a pretty I guess more neutral like
tan nude shade and this is quite light
on my lips
the next mini lipstick is my favorite
one out of all of them it's the shade
chai and I really like this it came with
the birthday gift I believe so again
you'd get this one and this shade in the
birthday gift if that's what you choose
from Sephora and last is the darkest
shade and this is the shade whiskey and
it's really beautiful it's super
pigmented just so you guys can see
that's one just swipe of it so yeah
those are all of my lipsticks so I just
went back and watched the footage and I
realized I didn't show you these two
either I just wasn't recording so yeah I
have two of the bite lip pencils this
one I got as these for a birthday gift
this is the shade glass a and this is
deep earth a gift
you can choose this as the birthday gift
and that is swatched here you guys can
see that
and then this brighter one is the shade
Zinfandel and this is my newest one the
only one I feel like I've really
purchased the other ones I somehow got
for Freight in some way or another but
anyway this is such a beautiful color I
thought it'd be really juicy and fun for
summer and spring and I'm really happy
with it
this is on sale for $10 on sports
website right now so yeah I think it was
worth the $10 and then the last grouping
of products that I have here before we
get into random lipsticks and then lip
liners these are my color pop lipsticks
I have to Villa P sticks and then this
is one of their blotted lips I don't
think they do these anymore I think they
might do them in the liquid formula but
I don't think they do it in this like
stick form but let me get you swatches
of these this first one I have here is
the shade wet and it is a pearlized
finish this I believe is discontinued so
you can't get it anymore but it's really
cool and something that I just keep
around for fun it's not something I use
very often I personally am NOT a big fan
of this color pop formula I haven't
tried the matte X in a shade I like so
maybe those would work for me but I've
kind of decided I don't really like them
which is sad because they're so cheap
and in the format I like the next shade
here is Aquarius and this was one I mean
I think it's okay it's just I wanted to
like it more than I do so yeah I just
feel like these are a little thick on
the lips for me and then this last one
is in the blotted lips formula this is
the shade DejaVu and I do like this
formula it's a bit drier and I like that
it's not super opaque which is something
I really like I like a more sheer lip
and so I do enjoy this I wish they
didn't get rid of them but I don't think
this is a formula that a lot of other
people liked so those are all of my
color pop lipsticks and then these last
three are the final lipsticks that I
have they're just a bunch of different
brands and stuff so we'll start with
this Kiko one it's a really bright coral
you guys have been seeing this on my
lips recently because it is new to me
this is from their new free soul
collection and it's the shade 0-4 and it
is a matte this isn't my favorite
lipstick ever I think the color is
really pretty
again it's
in a format that I really like I think
the packaging is a little bulky but I
will have a testing testing one two
three on a bunch of products from this
collection so stay tuned for that I
believe it'll be the video up tomorrow
yeah if you want to know my full
thoughts on that this next product is
from Revlon and it's part of their like
HD lip line I love this this is the
shade HD dawn and I love the color as
you can tell that's like my color I
really enjoy this I like the smell the
way it goes on the lips it has a little
bit of a shimmer to it but I like that
and last this is one of the elf matte
lip pencils and this is the shape T rose
this is like the most Mavi purple shade
that I have I think it's really pretty
something a little bit different for my
collection and for three dollars I think
it's good and last year I wanted to
throw in my lip liners I don't have a
lot in my personal collection I
definitely have way more in my kit lip
liners are something that I think is
really nice especially if you're gonna
do like lip liner a gloss I think that's
great but I just haven't found colors
that I really enjoy and I tend to just
bike glosses over these so anyway I have
some color pop these were sent to me
from Influenster with bite Beauty and
then this is one from Jordana so let me
get you some swatches this first one is
from Jordana and it's in the shade tawny
it's really really pretty
I've had mine quite a while definitely
an older product in my collection but I
do really like this and for the price I
think it's really really great I think
that lip liner works well it's a lot of
the different nudes i really enjoy my
collection from colour-pop i have three
different liners this first one is
disgusting I'm so sorry it's in the
shade lying around and this is a darker
red I like to use this for any of the
darker burgundy or Reds that I have in
my collection the next disgusting one I
have is the Aquarius shade which matches
the lipstick and the lip gloss and all
that I do like this is I think this is a
really pretty lip liner it's another one
I really enjoy out of my collection I
just realized I was wrong this shade is
the color dukes actually and then this
one is the shade not lying around it's
called Lion King and this one's a bit
more red instead of darker so yeah sorry
about that guys and then last year the
ones from bite I need to sharpen these
but this one is in the
color number 44 and this went with the
whiskey shade that you guys saw earlier
and then I also have the shade 20 and
this is a lighter nude which came with
the honeycomb shade and I do like this
but it's a little bit too nude for me
like I prefer both of these ones over it
it's a little bit more warm too but I
mean I got it for free I can't complain
too much the formula on this is a little
bit drier and I do enjoy that I just
didn't like how the darker one built up
I felt like it couldn't ever get very
even opacity it kind of looked patchy
and you had to keep building and whatnot
but overall I do like these lip liners
alright guys so that's our lipstick
collection I hope you guys enjoyed and I
will see you in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
