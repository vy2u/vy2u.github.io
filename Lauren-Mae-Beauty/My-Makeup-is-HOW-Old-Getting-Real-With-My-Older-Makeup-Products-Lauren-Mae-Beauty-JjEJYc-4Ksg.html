learn thank you so so much for watching
today we're gonna be talking about old
ass makeup and first off I was inspired
to do this video by Andrea she is dolled
up Daisy 24 here on YouTube I've been
subscribed to her like since I started
my channel definitely go check her out
she did a video about how old is your
makeup let me tell you and it's it's all
about showing you how you can figure out
what batch codes are and how old your
makeup actually is and it is surprising
she will tell you in that video so does
makeup is old it's very very old and so
that inspired me to go through my
collection and pick out some of these
items that have been kind of hard for me
to get rid of and try to figure out how
old they are
amber F also recently did a video
talking about Andrea in that video and
she also mentioned me and just had some
really good thoughts on pratchett
panning and declutter and so if you like
this video and you kind of are into this
mindset I'm gonna leave her video link
down below as well as her channel so
definitely check them out I it's funny
she uploaded that video today the day
I'm filming as I was like looking up my
makeup so I think it's definitely going
to strike a chord and I think a lot of
people are going to be very interested
and and hopefully it will help us put
into perspective our makeup collections
and how old some stuff is oh my gosh
okay so today I thought I would go over
some of the makeup that I had and tell
you the dates on some of this freaking
makeup and just some things I'm and
thoughts that I'm realizing to point
these items and just like with my own
collection and yeah I don't know it
definitely changes your perspective on
makeup and when you see these huge
makeup collections I just can't I just
know some of the stuff is probably way
too old like so freakin old I'll stop
talking let's get into some of the items
I checked this stuff on two different
websites one is check cosmetic calm and
also and the other one is check fresh
let me tell you what it is they'll be
linked down below yeah check fresh calm
so if you want to check out your makeup
you can go on those websites and you can
see the different brands you can add in
your bag
codes they don't have everything which
is kind of disappointing to me like ask
someone I'm like I want to check
literally everything in my collection
but some of these things I'm realizing
don't even have like numbers or you
can't check them on the site so I'm
trying to figure out more about like
what these like four digit letters and
numbers are to see if I can figure it
out on my own because I know that andrea
was mentioning something about that like
knowing what month it was in year so I'm
gonna go back and re-watch that and try
to figure that out
I think the first item I want to talk
about is the ladybird palette you guys
heard me tell you that I was going to
declutter this in my most recent makeup
basket because it just wasn't working
for me I've had this for a really long
time it's a matte palette it looks so
pretty I want to use it but I just never
did and so when I realized it just
wasn't working for me I was like I'm
gonna do clutter it and then I decided
you know what I want to look up how old
this is this was manufactured on
November 7th 2009 its 2017 it's almost
October 2017 so this is old that's like
seven years old
um that's too old for me
I feel like for me in my collection I'm
realizing to me five years is pretty old
I realized this was old but I think once
you see the date and you see 2009 and
you think about what you were doing in
2009 and you know how much your life has
maybe changed and even five years you
realize like holy no I don't want
to use this on my face so yeah it's
definitely it's definitely seeing the
numbers and the exact dates are putting
into perspective for me I will say I've
looked up some items that are newer to
my collection to kinda see how much time
they may be worth sitting in a factory
or in a store or being shipped from the
factory to the store where I bought it
or whatever the case may be and I will
say most of the time that's about a six
month period from when I bought it for
when it was manufactured so you can take
that into consideration with the items
but man it's going to blow your mind
guys okay this next eyes shadow is also
from Kat Von D and it's something that's
been hard for me to let go of because
it's really pretty it's a duochrome
it has like a
redshift to it I'm like yes this was
made November 4 2010 so this is six
years ten months and 21 days old it's
pretty old guys is it worth it
I'm gonna say let me work after that
it's like impossible not to but um it's
just too old for me it's not worth it
and then when you think about how long
it's gonna take to use up this eyeshadow
let's say I wanted a pan it like come on
at least a year so it's at that point
gonna be almost eight years old and
there's so much new makeup that you have
in your collection so I just I highly
suggest you guys checking out your
makeup and seeing how old your stuff is
and if it's actually worth keeping this
next one is one of my favorite blushes
and that's why I've kept it for so long
this is the blush from amazing cosmetics
in mucho mango now this is actually
discontinued and that should be my first
like red flag that mmm time to let it go
actually all this stuff is discontinued
so if your stuff is discontinued or
limited edition from like forever ago
check it out guys but this is
manufactured July 29th of 2011 so again
it's pretty old we're already past July
of 2017 so that's at least six years old
its jeweled it's just too old I have too
many amazing awesome things in my
collection to be wasting my time on
these older items sitting in my
collection this was one that really got
me to this is my Laura Mercier caviar
stick in orchid and I don't want to get
rid of this because it's so pretty it's
still creamy doesn't smell bad but when
I put it in and figured out how old this
is this is from Maine 31st of 2013 so
it's like definitely into the four years
and it's a cream product like I could
maybe do two you know if I was currently
trying to pan it but it's old you guys
and everyone can have their own like
whatever you feel comfortable with I'm
gonna try to shame you if you want to
use really old stuff and you feel fine
with it and it's not smelling bad and it
doesn't turned and hasn't changed
texture or whatever it is but something
that I'm learning for me is that I don't
want to have old makeup in my collection
I don't I want to use what I have and
enjoy it before it gets old I don't
really want
anything older than five years in my
collection even if it is a powder and if
it's some things like a cream or a
lipstick
I don't want it past three years for
sure and that's of course if it's not
you know smelling bad or having any
signs of decay this is something I
actually already declared but I still
have that bag with me because I haven't
gone to Arizona and I don't know why I
did throw this away because I'm pretty
sure that was my intention but it was in
there so I was like I wanna check it out
this was manufactured in November of
2012 so that makes this four years ten
months and 24 days old it's just old and
this is again discontinued I feel like
that's the big thing and something that
Andrea was talking about was that a lot
of these items that you get it like big
lots or I've bought some stuff off of
all cosmetics wholesale I haven't in a
really really long time but when you're
buying stuff that's that old or that was
limited-edition from the drugstore you
have to be really careful because a lot
of that stuff could be six seven years
old before you even get it she was
saying that some of her stuff that she
had was from like the 90s like 98 and 99
like that blows your mind that they're
even allowed to sell this and something
I will say too is that sometimes I can't
even find numbers on these things so I
really wish that was more transparent
with these makeup companies and there
was an easier way to find these batch
codes on their own websites so that you
could know what makeup is okay and safe
to use because it'll say on there that
oh 24 months once you've opened it but
if I've had it for six years like you
know that's you gotta go it's gotta go
next let's talk about this l'oreal
infallible shadow this is an amber rush
the you know cutest one everyone loves
it this was manufactured august 2012 so
this is five years one month and 24 days
old so old guys it's really old I had
two Mac products here but because I
wanted to test out kind of again how old
this was since I know I bought it this
year this one is for years ten months
old so definitely way too old I don't
want anything over three years when it
comes to lipsticks no but this is
something that I bought recently this is
the oil control lotion and this is 11
months old and that's from when it was
manufactured and I bought this in April
of this year so that's about six months
before I bought it and then I got it and
now we're almost out of year that it's
been manufactured but only six months
since it's been open
I did these as tests to just kind of
compare against the other things these
are both new Lancome items that I've
gotten so this one is the dual finish
highlighter this was manufactured in May
of 2017 so it's four months old and I
just got this really recently so that
makes me feel good and then this is the
monster big from Lancome and this was
March 2017 so this is about six months
old and I got this about a month ago and
something to note about these though are
these are brand new releases so these
are like new items to their collections
so what I think would be really
interesting is checking something that
you've recently bought that isn't a new
launch that is something a part of their
permanent line that they've had for a
long time and seeing how long and that's
been sitting in the store or sitting
it's sensitive and manufactured to when
you bought it I don't know just seems
interesting I know I'm probably like way
too excited about all this but um I'm
telling you once you go through your own
collection you'll understand what's
going on here before I get into my bath
and Bodyworks stuff because I believe it
is the check cosmetic that does Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works stuff so well if you've been
stocking up at these like semiannual
sales and you've been doing that for
like 70 or straight you might want to
check that out and make sure your
stuff is not like dying this is
something that I've been that I've held
onto for a really long time because I
really like its front to face and it
says on this sticker that it is the
natural beauty collection and has these
eyeshadows in it and blah blah blah and
I was trying to find a code for it
actually I'll show you what it looks
like on the inside so pretty right I
mean I've recently used this like a
month ago and then I was trying to find
the batch code I couldn't find anything
on here so I was like oh that's so weird
and then I saw that copyright 2011
two-faced cosmetics and I was like oh
wow 2011 like that's really old I'm
gonna get rid of this but then I thought
it was weird that I didn't have a batch
code on it because I was reading
somewhere that once it was 2005 is when
they started having to do that I think
then I realized that wait a minute
there's a sticker underneath this
sticker so I peeled this sticker back oh
man shady shady shit's going on I'm
sorry I'm cussing so much in this video
I'm very passionate about this so
consider this a two topic for the
cussing
um okay so I just peeled this sticker
off right and now it's the walk of shame
trio not the natural beauty it's totally
different and it says on here and this
one's at copyright 2011
this one says copyright 2005 so that
means that they made this in 2005 put
the sticker on it whatever it didn't
sell I guess they slap this thing on it
maybe it didn't sell better and then
they sold it to all cosmetics wholesale
I have no idea all I know is that it's
ridiculous it says on here on this
original sticker which I'm going to show
you close up so you guys can see this
insanity that I just uncovered I feel
like I am like Sherlock Holmes of the
beauty community right now with this
 it says 12 months on here then they
stuck this one on it no earlier than
2011 which also says 12 months on it
it's like well at this point it's
already 6 years old maybe it hasn't been
open but I think it's time to say
goodbye but no though anyway this is
just like it's just mind-blowing and
what was I saying Sam just called me
definitely puts into perspective that I
probably won't buy anything off of all
five bonus wholesale I probably won't
buy anything from Big Lots either cuz it
just freaks me out now like that it's
probably like 5 years old already and
then to think that it might spend
another five years of my collection just
like nah dawg I can't I can't do it so
um yeah this one's crazy so let me get
into my Bath and Body Works stuff and
that's what I'm gonna end it on I have a
lot of Bath &amp;amp; Body Works stuff that's
old I used to be really into going to
Bath and Body Works and just using with
coupons and doing the sales and I just I
over bought so much so anyway this was a
spray that I was working on last month
and my part to fuse it up and I decided
just to check the date this one is from
June 14th of 2012 that's when this was
manufactured so that's pretty old it
doesn't smell so some of these things
like when it comes to this I'm not
necessarily going to get it rid of it
just I put these on here so I can like
be like girl use this up this one is
from October 12th of 2014 so it's not as
old but it's I mean it's crazy to think
that this is already three years old
before I'm even using it that's crazy
this one is from October 10th of 2014
this shower gel which
my head I finally used up all my old
shower gels with like the old packaging
and so to me I'm like this is the new
packaging but this is manufactured
August 23rd of 2013 it's not that new
Lauren it's not that new but in my head
I feel like it is and that's that's the
thing you just you forget or you just
think like oh it's old but it's fine but
like when you see the numbers you see
like you see six years pop up on that
screen you're like whoa I need to
reevaluate some things I have two more
things just to tell you this is a candle
and I had a huge backstop I have a video
on my channel my candle collection it's
like one of my first videos and yeah I
have like a million candles like look
you can tell it's old because look at
the inside of this Wow still smells
great it smells like leaves so they must
definitely be using those preservatives
it's working this is from July 10th of
2012 that's when this was manufactured
isn't that crazy guys so it's definitely
making me very motivated to use this
stuff up and it's also making me really
motivated to just buy what I can
actually use within a reasonable amount
of time I don't need to buy 700 candles
I can buy two candles and burn them and
then go up and buy two more freaking
candles like why do I have to hoard them
like the apocalypse is coming I don't
know and I don't do it really anymore
I'm still burning through all my old
crap but yeah it just makes you think
and then last year this is an auntie
back and this is from March 20th of 2014
so that's kind of this video I hope I
didn't hope it in grossed you out too
much with all my old makeup but
definitely opened my eyes and that was
the whole point of this is I just wanted
to show you what I had in my collection
and hopefully you can go through your
collection and this can be the final
straw of you getting rid of maybe some
that really really old stuff or if you
really truly love something using it up
before it's like entirely gone guys
alright and that's everything for this
video guys definitely make sure to check
out the other two women I mentioned and
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
