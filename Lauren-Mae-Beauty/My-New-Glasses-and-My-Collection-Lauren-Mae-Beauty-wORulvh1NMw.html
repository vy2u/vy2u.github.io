Lauren I thought it'd be fun to do a
look at my new glasses talk about firm
ooh who is who sent these to me as well
as do a bit of a collection video on the
other glasses that I own if you guys
didn't know I know I don't wear glasses
in most videos but I have to wear
glasses in real life I have really
really bad eyesight yeah when I go
outside at night it is I can't even read
signs like at all it's horrible so
glasses are just an essential part of my
day-to-day life I have never worn
contacts I probably won't I'd probably
just get LASIK
I just prefer glasses instead of
contacts and like putting something on
my eye it just kind of freaks me out
anyway these obviously are my new pair
of glasses I absolutely love these Verma
contacted me and asked me if I wanted to
go on their website pick out a pair of
glasses and then tell you guys about
them and I was like oh yeah I love
glasses and I usually only get glasses
like every two years because I choose to
get really expensive glasses and just
ones that I know are really quality and
that are gonna last and that I really
like on my face so talis opportunity to
try something out is really excited so I
picked these out I went a little out of
my comfort zone but I wanted something
kind of funky something new something
different and I absolutely love these
they are so cute they have a gold rim
all the way around they have the feet on
them on the inside there and then they
also have some really nice like metal
detailing there like a soft blush pink
I'm in love with them I think they're so
cute and now these are the glasses that
I wear like every day instead of my
Prada ones which I just recently got at
the beginning of the year I thought
these were amazing quality especially
for the price most of the glasses on the
website come out to about $40 like 3937
there's some for 25 but I haven't really
seen I don't think anything really over
40 so you can get your frames with like
standard lenses for about $40 or less
which is an amazing deal because I'm
used to spending like a couple hundred
of dollars on my glasses and to get
something that's just as stylish and you
can switch up seasonally is awesome I
thought I would show you two what they
came with they came in
this case this is a hard case it has
like a map on it they fit in there
really nicely it's nice and sturdy the
print isn't like ugly and I think it's
kind of cute that it's not just black so
there's that it also came with a soft
pouch and then it also came with like a
glasses cleaner and the thing that I
thought was the most awesome that it
came with was this little tool and this
has a tiny little Philips and a tiny
little flathead I don't know if those
are the names of them but see it comes
with a little screw so if your screws
come loose you can use this to fix up
I'm gonna keep this I can fix my other
glasses in case something happens I just
thought that was like a nice little
handy tool this video is not sponsored
by firm u but they did give me a
discount code for you guys it's Lauren
May I will have everything linked down
below it is not an affiliate link but
with my coat and with the page there are
49 different glasses you can choose from
and you get free frames free lenses
definitely check it out I cannot stress
to you enough how awesome that deal is
it does end on July 16th so it isn't
like a forever code it only is for a
little bit of time if you are at all
wanting to try out some new frames
something more fun that you don't want
to spend a ton of money on well but the
code you ain't spent any money which is
crazy I actually did spend a little bit
more money on mine because my
prescriptions so messed up that it's
like more advanced or whatever so I
ended up paying $10 for like the upgrade
for my lenses just to have them actually
be a lens I could see out of so that is
something potentially you might have to
pay like an upcharge of if you have like
a different type of lens that cost more
money or if you want to upgrade
different things those will just be
additional charges again you do have to
pick from the glasses on the page from
the link down below but there's 49
there's a really a cute pair of blue
ones that I kind of want to get myself
look I just think it's an amazing deal
if you guys wanted to try out maybe some
more funky glasses if you wanted to try
out glasses with clear lenses even if
you don't wear glasses but just wanted
to use it as like an accessory or
stylized thing and you can also get
prescription sunglasses on there too
which is something I'm gonna be looking
into I haven't had a pair of
prescription sunglasses until this year
but I haven't been used
much because I'm so scared that I'm
going to break them or lose them and
they were really expensive so I think to
kind of get myself in the habit I might
get a pair from them and see
anyway amber I also was contacted by
from you and she did a review on them
and just talked about them as well I'm
gonna leave her video link down below if
you want more information or a second
opinion
I trust her a ton and I'm doing more
like a collection just to kind of show
you guys my style and glasses I thought
that would just be fun because they are
as much as you guys don't see them
they're a big part of who I am on like
in the real world because I wear them on
my face every single day so I will leave
this specific pair link down below if
this is something you're interested in
and I will try to link my other glasses
down below too even though they're not
from Ferno they're so cute right I kind
of like them they're like a little bit
like down I feel like I'm a British like
scientist looking at like plant and
sketching in my notebooks like oh this
is whatever oh I got a new plant species
like but like fashionable I don't know
anyway that's it I think so this is
gonna be the first tear glasses they're
so cute I'm obsessed with them let's
move on it's so weird to like take them
off well do these in order of I guess my
favorite into my least favorite but
that's it's more just like my most
recent to my oldest just because my
style has changed a little bit and also
my preference has changed so something I
realized I really like in glasses it's
having the feet so these ones are from
Prada these are the ones that I was
wearing barely crooked
oh my these are the ones that I was
wearing before I got the new pair every
single day I love these because they
don't touch under here like if I smile
and I'm like laughing having a great
time I don't get like messed up makeup
here and I find that the feet just stay
on my nose better and I feel like
there's just less points of contact on
my face so I don't feel like my glasses
are like mauling my face I love these
glasses I think they're so cute I feel
really like smart and just like smart
isn't like the British term smart I
really like these ones again these are
from Prada I have two more pairs of
glasses and then I have
the sunglasses so the next pair I'm
gonna do I hope these aren't too dirty
some of my stuff is like so dirty these
are from Prada as well and these are
ones that I wore all the time before I
got my new glasses at the end of the
year this is what those look like
they're dark all the way around and as
you can see they don't have the footing
there so if I smile a lot they my cheeks
head a little bit it doesn't look bad
but I'm just my makeup constantly
throughout the day that's getting more
oily and it just picks up products there
so I have to constantly be tapping it
out same with this part these constantly
would slide down my face and because
there's so much point of contact and
it's not just like a little foot I felt
like I mean I had to constantly tap out
my makeup people thought I was like
sweating or like crying I'm like no I'm
tapping my makeup out mmm I really like
these glasses I think they fit my face
really nicely it's weird seeing them cuz
now I'm used to the other ones but I do
really like these glasses I think
they're really cute these are ones that
I bring with me if I'm like not as
worried about how I'm gonna look or
these are more just like if I'm not
wearing any makeup and I just want to
feel really simple these ones are the
ones I wear and then my last pair
glasses aren't these ones here these are
from Dolce and Gabbana and partially
seriously the reason I got these I'm
gonna try to hold them back I got them
because they have this beautiful rose
gold detailing on the side of them they
have a rose with like a little like leaf
they're so cute and I could not pass
them up so I got these at the same time
I got last ones I showed you and these
to me are like winter glasses just
because they're are so dark but I just
think they're so adorable you can tell
that these mimic that last pair I had on
and they kind of coupled together and
then my new style is just more big and
off the face I definitely think you can
see the transition but these are what
they look like they're so cute I really
do like these I think I'm still gonna
try to bust these out for winter this
year or I might just get a pair from I
really wish to have a subscription box
like a seasonal subscription box I know
that seems a little excessive but for
someone like me where I I had these
types of glasses for two years I just
think it'd be so fun to be able to
change up your look and again just not
feel so scared to like ruin your glasses
that's totally how I am and I like being
careful with my stuff regardless of
price because I paid for it and it's
mine but it's nice that you don't have
to be so worried if like something
happens to them because I'm telling you
I was like paranoid in my glasses but
anyway these are this these are these
pair um and let's move on to my
sunglasses I'm gonna have to tap out all
my makeup and the last pair of glasses I
have in my collection are these
beautiful beautiful glasses these are
sunglasses and these are from Gucci
Gucci Gucci that is what they look like
they are so pretty I love them they kind
of have that cat eye I feel like they're
in between Wayfarer style and like cat
eyed I really like them I think they're
really chic and I like how dark they are
too but those are my Gucci sunglasses
that I never wear and need to but I'm
too scared I'll break that they're so
cute though aren't they cute as you can
tell I'm just obsessed with glasses I
feel like if you're gonna have something
on your face every day and it's gonna be
something that people recognize you buy
but it should be something that you love
and that feels good and that you you
feel beautiful in so I hope you guys
enjoyed this like collection video but
also just like a rave review of fur Moo
I think that their stuff is just so good
and again definitely use my coupon code
I don't get paid anything off the coupon
code but I just think it's an amazing
deal I'm even gonna have Sam go on there
and I told him about the code I got he's
like I'm gonna go get a pair of
sunglasses I was like yeah you should so
I just highly recommend I think the
quality is great especially for the
price I feel like they feel nice and
high-end and sturdy like my other
glasses if I got these at a store I
would not be able to tell a difference
which is crazy but yeah that's
everything I hope you guys enjoyed and
that you're having a wonderful day
yeah that's it I'll see you my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
