Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be doing a new type
of video on my channel I talked about
this idea in a video quite a while back
and then I was looking through my ideas
and was like oh yeah I want to do that
so this is going to be a brand breakdown
I'm going to be going through different
brands so we're starting with NYX today
and so I've taken a look at the website
and what they offer and I thought I
would share with you five things that
I'm really interested in things that
intrigue me that I want to try and then
five things that don't and why I don't
want them or why I am NOT interested so
I hope you guys like this idea it's
almost like a new Beauty launches but
its brand specific and instead of it
only focusing on new things we can look
at like older things in a collection I
feel like there's so much focus on new
makeup releases and so many brands have
a ton of products that you know either
fall through the cracks and don't get a
ton of hype or are just older in their
collection but not necessarily bad or
maybe no one wants them we'll see right
with that though I just want to mention
real fast this is one of my pre-recorded
videos so I am in Italy right now if you
guys aren't following me on Instagram
you should be because I'm gonna be
posting pictures and I'm also going to
be doing Instagram stories so you can
catch up with me in real time there and
if you like this look I do have a
tutorial on it it is in my wet n wild
flights of fancy which went up earlier I
will make sure to link that down below
if you want to check it out other than
that let's get into the video so we're
gonna start off with the essence the
things that I'm really excited about
from the brand I think this is a really
cool exercise to do because it really
lets you know what your style
preferences are if you pick out five
things from a brand that you're
interested in it can kind of like show
you what you're into so anyway the first
item that I have a YES on is the total
control drop foundation this comes in 30
shades it retails for $14 and this is
something that I have seen a lot of
people talk about I know a lot of people
don't like it but I think a lot of
people do and the reason that it's
interesting to me is because I believe
this is like a medium coverage
foundation I think it's supposed to be
like full coverage with four drops or
something but in every review and
everything I've ever seen that's not the
case I just like the idea of this being
kind of lighter weight it's just very
thin and liquidy
I've never tried a foundation like that
before so this is just
that's caught my eye it's been around
for a while so it's not like a new one
and I think the shade range is really
nice and honestly I don't think I've
ever tried a foundation from NYX so I
would be interested to try that one I
think out of everything that they have
that's the one that really gets me next
on my list is an eyeshadow palette and
this is the ultimate eyeshadow palette
and I wanted the brights one it does
come in three other shades but this is
the one that I love you guys know I love
color and I love that this is an
affordable palette it retails for $18
which is a bit expensive but from what
I've heard a lot of people really like
this palette they say the pigmentation
is pretty nice especially for again the
price I really love some of the greens
that are in there and like teal colors I
think they're a little bit more
interesting than kind of the classic
ones you see so this palette has kind of
always caught my eye I've always kind of
wanted to get it but I do have other
like bright or colorful shadows in my
collection so it's never just like at
the forefront but if I had to pick five
things from the brand that I would pick
up this would be one of them something
that I thought was really interesting
when I was on the website I was looking
at this palette and for two extra
dollars you can get it engraved with
your name or whatever you want on it I
thought that was like really strange and
kind of cool but like just odd very odd
anyway okay next on the list is
something that I actually already have
but I would want to kind of expand the
shades that I have in my collection and
these are the butter glosses i really
love this gloss I just love glosses in
general these ones have like the right
amount of pigmentation they definitely
transform your lips into the color that
they have but it's not so a pink that
you're just like you know scared it's
gonna go everywhere I think they have a
lot of really pretty like neutral pinky
peachy shades I have the shade at Claire
in my collection currently and I would
love to just try out some other ones I
know these are an older product on the
market but they're so affordable they're
$5 they smell amazing they feel great on
the lips they're almost like this
moisturizing formula they're not sticky
and I would definitely want to enhance
my collection with more of those because
I think they're really great the fourth
item that I would pick up from the brand
or that I'm really excited about are the
faux white eyeliners these retail for
eight dollars they're eight different
shades and you guys know that I almost
always wear white on my lower waterline
I like to keep my eyes pretty bright and
open because they do have smaller eyes
and their almond shaped so anything I
can get to kind of
them look more open and awake I
definitely alike and I really like the
idea of these they're different shades
of like basically white with like a drop
of purple or pink or green or yellow but
I think they would make a difference
enough like if you were doing a colorful
look instead of doing a stark white
eyeliner in the waterline you could do a
blue like a pastel blue for like a blue
look or something and I think it'd be
really cool so these are just something
that I think's really interesting I
don't feel like that many people are
doing eyeliners like this and because I
utilize white on my waterline all the
time I feel like this products like made
for me alright and the number five item
that I would want to pick up from NYX is
the vivid brights cream colors I
basically want all the colors these
retail for 10 dollars there's 12
different shades you can use these in so
many different ways as eyeliners you
could use them I feel like as like kind
of a brow situation is similar to Kat
Von D I haven't tried them yet but I've
heard really great things I love the
different color selections and I just
think they are useful if you're into
doing more artistic looks or colorful
looks I think they'd be great to cut the
crease as well so you don't always have
to use like a concealer you could use
like a pastel purple or something and
then even then not fill it in and just
have that kind of like this matte cream
purple going into whatever else you're
doing I think would be so pretty yeah I
just think these are great for like so
many different things you want to do you
could utilize them to like fill in
bigger parts of the face you could do
like faux freckles like there's just so
much you can do with them so I
definitely have these on my list they've
been on my list for a while and yeah
those are the top 5 items that I would
pick up if someone was like hey you can
get 5 items that's what I would get and
here are 5 items that I'm kind of just
like oh ya know what why either they
just wouldn't work for me
I know looking straight off or I'm just
kind of confused based off of other
things in their line we'll get into the
reasons as we go through them so the
first item on here is a pigment primer
this is 6:50 and I'm kind of just
confused I currently have the NYX
glitter primer I'd really enjoy it I use
it all the time I used it today for this
look and I just don't understand the
need for a pigment primer I don't
understand how that's so much different
than what the glitter primer is doing
I'm sure it has to be like a tacky base
and I just feel like it's one of those
situations where they're just like
coming up with more products to just
kind of like fill needs that aren't
necessarily there like this one product
can do so much but instead of just
having one product they have like five
different products to to fill that need
you know what I mean like I just I don't
think you need that if you have it
though and if you're like no it's so
different let us know in the comments I
could be totally wrong again I haven't
tried these things it's just like based
off of what I'm saying I'm like just use
the glitter primer I already have next
on the list is the holographic halo
finishing powder this retails for twelve
dollars this is just a confusing product
to me it's essentially kind of this like
glowy setting powder it kind of reminds
you the lancome ones that i have that
are like they are so metallic almost i
think this one though is gonna have like
a duochrome effect why would you set
your face with that I just don't
understand why you would want to do that
it says you can lightly set your face or
use it as a highlighter and so either
it's gonna be a weak highlighter or it's
going to be a super glowy crazy setting
powder and that's just not necessarily
gonna look good maybe there's a way if
you want to look like you have I don't
know unicorn skin or something and I get
that people can do off on card things I
just don't think you need this if you
really want to set your face with
holographic or like duo chromatic powder
use a highlighter you might already have
in your collection it's just a strange
strange product and I feel like it's
trying to capitalize on the the
popularity of duochrome and holographic
and stuff but like it's just not
practical or wearable so like it's just
a powder that would sit in your drawer
to me next is a cake eyeliner this is
the cake that powder eyeliner this
retails for eight dollars and I will say
I'm happy that NYX has this I think it's
great that people who are makeup artists
can get affordable products and not only
you know use high-end stuff and stuff
that's gonna actually perform in school
we used cake eyeliners just to like know
about them they're water activated but
like for me personally it's just not
something I ever use it's not something
that I would need I've never had the
need for a cake eyeliner
hmm since I've worked like at all the
only thing I could see is like maybe you
can make a mascara out of it if you
really needed to but like for the most
part you don't want things around the
eyes to be activated by water in case
someone cries or in case someone gets
wet or they're sweating your makeup is
going to be like ruined in two seconds
this is a very classic makeup product so
like there's something about it that I
like the nostalgia and the fact that
this like more modern brand who's coming
up with like holographic face powders is
also having a product like this in their
line like I think it's like paying
homage paying homage Oh Maj Amash you'd
like don't say the age right I don't
know anyway they're like throwing it
back and I like that as an idea but not
as a practicality and like a product I
would not want this product and honestly
I don't think that a lot of people are
like everyday consumers would use this
product or really even know what this
product is the number four item on my
knots list is the element I shadow
palettes so I don't know these are just
like I think that I'm just bitter no I
think that the release for these was so
exciting I was so happy that they had
influencers kind of the face of these
palettes it wasn't like a collaboration
but it was really cool they were teasing
us it was exciting and then they threw
this price at us that made us all just
like have to take a step back and be
like what is happening to this planet
because these were $30 on the website
when I was looking they are marked down
to $24 which i think is a better price
but I don't know they just they just
went too big on this one like I'm
excited I like the color stories I like
the idea but then they threw that price
and it just dampened everything it's
just something I don't even want to like
support like I don't even want them to
think like that they can get my money
like that honestly honestly guys I also
have heard reviews that said like
they're not even that great of quality
which is disappointing like at least if
you're gonna make the price that
expensive like really show us that it's
worth it and yeah those are just
something that no I'll never pick up I
don't forget okay okay and then number
five this is a mascara and it's the fly
with me mascara it retails for nine
dollars and the reason I
this is because of the wand it has like
this ball shape on the end and mascara
is a very personal thing so if this is
your favorite mascara I'm really happy
it works for you I've never tried it but
it's just like I don't need a gimmicky
mascara to make me want to buy it I
don't think that because there's a ball
in the end it's not more intriguing to
me flashes I don't want to mess around
with I just want them to look great
every single day it's kind of like this
workhorse product in my collection I
know that they constantly come out with
new mascaras all the time like the
butterfly wing this one looks like an
hourglass this one looks like whatever I
don't see how this could really benefit
me besides poking myself in the eye and
I'm just like it's just one of those
things that I'm like no I'm gonna stick
to my ways I'm not gonna go outside of
my box not worth it to me
I'll just pick up the normal one but
yeah so those are my wants and my not
let me know what items intrigued you
from NYX let me know what items you were
like definitely don't want from the
brand as well I will say I think NYX is
a great brand in the sense that they
have so many different products I kind
of think of them as like the American
like Kiko or something like they have
new collections coming out and they
really do kind of like switch up their
line quite often which i think is
exciting and exhausting all at the same
time it's it's a lot of things but I
think that some of the items that they
have are really really great and
innovative and not things that other
drugstore brands or lower price pointed
makeup are really coming out with like
those vivid bright scream colors like
not that many brands drugstore brands
and I can think of that are really
accessible in the United States for me
have things like that especially at the
price point so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy this series it's kind of like a
fun one we're positive we're a little
you know feisty but I hope you guys
enjoy let me know what brand you want me
to do next I would love to know and that
is everything thank you guys so so much
for watching and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
