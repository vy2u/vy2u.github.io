a nail polish declutter today I've been
seeing a couple videos going around I
saw Jacqueline's declutter video and I
also saw LS and they both are getting
rid of polishes and I was thinking about
it and it's like I have no nail polish
on right now I haven't worn nail polish
in a while and I do have a project that
I'm doing with my nail polish where I'm
trying to use each one once and then
declutter from there and I did it to
clutter up my nail polishes I want to
say earlier this year but because I
haven't been wearing them I thought you
know what I'm gonna go through and try
to get rid of as many of these as I can
I love them they're beautiful I just
don't wear them and it feels so wasteful
I really want other people to enjoy them
now I'm gonna try to be actually
cutthroat with this we'll see how it
goes so I counted these up I have a
total of 157 color nail polishes and
then 13 like top coats and that type of
stuff so my goal is to get rid of 50
which would almost be a third of my
polishes and I think that would be
amazing like absolutely amazing I feel
like I kind of know what I like I like
creams I like Pink's basically any
Pink's fun colors and then glitters so I
need to just be very serious with myself
and these ones here all the colors have
actually warned this year so look how
small this pile is compared to the
massive pile here I'm also gonna use
that as motivation being like okay I
know you love all these but this is
realistically what you've worn some of
these I haven't even used at all ever in
my whole life all right I'm gonna sort
these out by color and then I will come
back and we'll get into the video this
is gonna be super in-depth we're gonna
go through each color and I'm gonna do
them by color because I think that'll be
the easiest way to decide between colors
so I will be back
all right so I have them all sorted out
I obviously love pinks it's probably my
biggest pile and then surprisingly I
have a lot of Blues and I don't normally
wear blues I think maybe they look so
pretty like those mint blues in the
container so I think I can hopefully
downsize this quite a bit
obviously Purple's I did like a little
bit of a red situation greens I had a
lot of I thought these are all like
glitters and toppers I have like my top
coats and things in the back these are
neutrals and then I have metallics so
we're gonna get into it I'm gonna zoom
you in
we're probably gonna just start with I
don't know I guess Purple's they're just
right here in the front so let's get
going and hopefully we came to clutter
50 of these guys we're zoomed in super
close right now I know these all don't
look like Purple's but it was really
hard to decide like wow what was pink
and what was purple and what not so this
is the best I could do I'm gonna go
through first and just pick the ones I
know I want to keep like looking at this
I'm like yes I want that one yes I want
that one so first off I love this Lime
Crime one now I'm not someone who really
supports Lime Crime but I got these on
all cosmetics wholesale a long long time
ago and I love every single one of these
line crime I don't even know nail
polishes this one's in the color
lavender II I love it it's like my
favorite cream purple so I will be
keeping that one I also really liked
both of these metallics up here at the
front
this one is butter LONDON fairy lights
it's a really pretty metallic purple but
it has like a warm undertone to it so I
love that one and then this one here is
from Essie and it's also a metallic
purple but this one is cool toned and
this is in the color nothing else metals
so I am definitely gonna keep that one
as well something I know I want to get
rid of is this one here
I just don't gravitate to Purple's very
much and especially not something this
dark and this cool toned this is the
color Mario from butter LONDON
so we have one down I feel like all
three of these are very similar so just
to let you guys know this is ESI's
underwear
this is ESI's full steam ahead and then
this one is go Jin --za
dojin's a-- yeah i think that's what
it's called i'm not sure which one i
like so what I'm actually gonna do is
take a piece of junk mail I know so
classy and I'm going to just swatch
these and see what I think of like the
opaqueness cuz I think that's something
that's important okay so out of these
three I'd like this one in opaqueness
the best the other ones you can tell
like kind of looks tricky this one looks
really nice so I'm gonna keep this one
because it's a little bit lighter and
I'm gonna get rid of both of these so
we're down three polishes right now you
guys that's so good I'm so happy okay
this one from Illamasqua I really do
like this is in the shade speckle and it
was part is that kind of like Easter I'm
looking polishes I also have one in like
a blue
I don't wear these all the time but when
I do I think they're really fun and I
think they are really good polishes so
I'm gonna keep that one I know I want to
keep Lincoln Park after dark from OPI so
I'll keep that one I also really do like
this one from butter LONDON this is the
color Queen Vic I'll keep that this is a
color that I've looked at and I just
don't really like so I'm gonna get rid
of scoundrel from butter LONDON
we're down for polishes so all of these
ones look really similar let me bring
them down this one is the color soy gras
from China Glaze
I have a C's Moreno cool and then I also
have loving the dunes from Deborah
Lippman I think we're gonna go to
swatching for this one just to see
what's going on all right that one's
pretty dark
that one's a little bit more grey and
then we have the Deborah Lippmann one
okay so I just think the Deborah
Lippmann one is like so beautiful so I'm
gonna keep that one I left how opaque it
is I love the tone of it it's like a
kind of a mix it's a little bit darker
than this in a little more gray but I
kind of do like this one boy Gras - I'm
gonna keep this one for now but if I see
something similar and like my neutrals I
might you know do a little duel and see
which one wins and then I'm gonna get
rid of actually
gessie Moreno cool it's pretty but I
just find it's like a little shear
there's no reason for it to be that
shear I think this one is so fun from
OPI this is the color push and purple so
I want to swatch it just to see it looks
like it might be a little shear it is a
little shear but it's so fun I'm gonna
keep that one for now this is so hard
guys okay I have these two here and I
feel like I only need one this is a
really sheer one from butter LONDON in
the color knackered and it's kind of
almost like a topcoat it's so pretty
I'm gonna get rid of it because it's one
of those ones that look so pretty in the
bottle and like iridescent and like oh
my gosh but it's ultimately like a green
purple which isn't actually that pretty
on the nail you know what I mean so I'm
gonna get rid of that this one from
Essie is the color for the twill of it
it's so pretty I want to wear this
haven't yet but I want to I don't know I
kind of like it you know what though I'm
gonna get rid of this one because
sometimes these ones I think I'm gonna
wear them but they just aren't my
favorite I'd rather go like a full
metallic than something that changes
which is so weird cuz with eyeshadow I
love these but I guess not with nail
polish as much we only have a few left
let's just get through a more in just
stop being a baby okay this one I'm
gonna get rid of this is actually
something I got in France when me and
Sam went the second time and I have
never worn it but I think I keep it
because it's you know from France but
it's just like a drugstore polish it's
not like a big deal so I'm gonna get rid
of that one this is SC's the lace is on
and I kind of like that that's pretty
right let's watch it see I really like
that one I'm gonna keep that one for can
we get rid of half of these that is the
question we have splash of grenadine
which I know I really like this one's
sitting pretty I'm just gonna get rid of
it we don't who needs to just watch it I
guess I do because I just did it's super
sheer don't want it splash of grenadine
is so pretty I really do like this color
there's just like something about it it
is a little bit sheer as well
but I like it so I'm gonna keep that one
if you can't tell I really do more like
the warm toned Purple's okay so to OPI
is this one is you're such a Budapest
and this one is OPI you're you're so
euro I think that's what it is I really
like this it's like a nice classic
cobalt blue I mean the formula is super
nice and then this one is very similar I
think to bikini so teeny it's pretty I
just it just takes her ever to build it
up and it's kind of like gray tone I'm
gonna get rid of that one I'm gonna keep
this one remember - so money actually
I'm just gonna leave a counter on the
screen we got rid of a lot of polishes
though I am so happy we got rid of ten
polishes we're we're a fifth of the way
to our goal
I'm so excited okay let's move on to
Blues hear all the Blues we have 27
different ones here and I'm hoping I can
eliminate at least ten again like the
last one I thought that was really good
so I'm gonna start off with the things I
know I want for sure so definitely the
Sally Hansen Pacific Blue that's a cult
favorite for a reason I love that color
I also want to keep this Lime Crime like
a baby blue again I just love these
polishes they're so opaque they just are
a great cream formula I can usually get
away with like one coat if I wanted to
so definitely keeping that the two
things I know I want to get rid of I'm
gonna get rid of both of these deborah
lippmann this one here is in ray of
light and it's just super sheer it's so
pretty I don't know if you can see all
those beautiful like I don't even know
what kind of glitters they are but it's
so sheer you have to build it up a
million times I hate it so I'm gonna get
rid of the deborah lippmann color it's
just not worth it I'm also getting rid
of Lady Sings the Blues it's such a
pretty blue and never wear it though and
I just it's one of those ones again that
looks so pretty in the bottle but isn't
practical
another one I know I want to keep this
is blue Rhapsody from Essie it's just
one of those really pretty metallics it
came with the other metallic I already
showed you in purple and I think they
just look so great so I want to keep
that I'm also gonna keep this deborah
lippmann this is mermaids dream it's a
really great color it's not something I
wear all the time but it's one that I
actually want to keep from her another
kind of stand out to me is this one from
Essie this is in the color
bobaloo it's a shimmer and there's just
something about it I don't have anything
quite like this once I want to keep that
I also want to keep dive-bar this is
just another one of those like really
pretty deep blues I feel like if I'm
gonna go for a blue I'm probably gonna
go for this or for something that's like
really light so I'm gonna keep that guy
I think that one of the colors that I
keep seeing are these like I don't know
why I was so into these but these are
all a very similar tone to me it's like
a periwinkle
essentially this is bikini so teeny
which is like a cult favorite I used to
love this but it's so sure it's just a
crappy formula I don't know why we all
love this I'm getting rid of it these
two are very similar to me I'm gonna
bring out the handy-dandy swatch on
paper let's see what's going on this is
the color electric beat and I did really
like this entire actual collection from
China Glaze so that one's kind of pretty
this one is sailing away no smooth
sailing I was close from Essie and then
this one here these two are kind of
similar this is the color chills and
thrills I don't know if I've ever worn
this oh it looks like I have that one's
pretty nice I like the formula and then
this one here is I know what boys like
from Deborah Lippmann I only I don't
know this is just a lackluster to me I'm
gonna get rid of this for my style I
just I think I know too that I love
pinks and we're getting up to the pink
soon and I'm gonna want to keep like
every single one of them so I want to
like do a good job of getting rid of the
other colors I don't need I don't think
I need this trying to glaze one either
so i'ma go to that this one I think is
really pretty but I'm gonna swatch it
against Pacific Ocean what is it pacific
blue look how much better it is like if
i ever had to make the choice i would
choose this one every time it's just so
much better so yeah i'm gonna get rid of
this SE one and i think i'm just gonna
get rid of the Sailing one two smooth
sailing so those are all gone oh here's
another one sprog from butter LONDON
very similar oh it's like a grey it has
a nice formula I'm gonna keep it for now
these are all like the darker ones left
so maybe I'll go through those this is
butter LONDON blogger this is butter
LONDON
royal navy and then this
is butter London's or better London this
is China glazes ride the weight this one
looks pretty dang sheer like almost like
a jelly polish I'm gonna get rid of that
one it's so crazy because when you do a
declutter like I love doing to clutters
often and with you know every time you
do a declutter your mind sets different
and you can choose to get rid of
different things but when I did my last
declutter I thought it was being really
good like trying really hard and now
seeing this I've already gotten rid of
so many polishes and it's just crazy you
know I just suggest decluttering often
this is royal navy I have a feeling I'm
gonna keep this one just cuz it's so
dark and it's a cream I don't have any
dark ones that are creams right now see
that one from OPI I'm gonna get rid of
it this is one of the ones we talked
about last time this is the OPI you're
so euro I don't need that it's this
color and I just swatch this and it's
like out of those two I'm gonna go for
the dark blue not that other one and
then this one from butter LONDON is
blogger and it's not really a blue I
feel like I'm gonna go towards it's
looking a lot brighter I feel like in
person I'm gonna keep it for now I'm
gonna keep it for now so I want to keep
probably one of these colors cuz I
really don't go for him that much this
is slapper which is like such a classic
color I feel like this is probably the
one I'm gonna keep cuz it's so pretty I
really like that color so let's see how
the other ones go
this is I'm addicted don't really like
that name
super sheer but really pretty but sheer
it's too sheer getting rid of that this
is the color in the Cabana this was a
super popular one too I remember when
this one came out I might keep this one
yeah that's a good one see look how it
doesn't it's not all sheer like the
other ones I'm keeping cabana in the
Cabana and then this one can't find my
checkbook hahahahaha I'm gonna get rid
of this one I think it's so pretty
though but it's kind of similar to in
the Cabana this is more blue but I'm
gonna get rid of it I don't need it yeah
I'm only keeping those two from those
that's pretty good and I think that
they're quite a bit different ones like
a lot darker ones a little bit lighter
we're moving on to the like minty
Green's so these three are very similar
stuff this is hideous look at how its
separated and everything I just don't
need that Simon the air out of that for
sure and if you really wanted to know
that is Parker perfect from I see these
colors to me look basically I dental and
they're both from OPI this one here is
our gancho in green grape and this one
is Suzy without a paddle so I'm gonna
swatch them next to each other see which
color is a better formula with opacity I
do like gargantuan green grape though I
feel like this color has changed like I
feel like it used to be more green than
blue but maybe my mind has just changed
oh yeah this is a better formula I'm
getting rid of gargantuan green grape
I'm keeping Suzy without a paddle this
is a part of the OPI infinite shine
series I do have the top coat and bottom
coat so I'm going to actually try these
out I've had them for a while and I
haven't tried them so keeping that this
one here is from Essie in the color mint
candy apple I feel like this one has
gotten a lot of hype and it is pretty I
do like it I think I'm gonna keep it for
now I know they're so similar but just
let me have this and then the last two
here let's see we're gonna keep one of
them this one is from OPI it's the with
stands the test of time but spelled like
the herb oh wow that's pretty it's
definitely more green than I thought it
was going to turn out and then this one
is to yacht to handle and it's wrong I
don't want to say Coastal Scents
China guys oh wow they're so different
guys this one is like such a neon and
this one is like I'm gonna get rid of
this one from OPI I keep the neon you
guys I did it again okay so we have a
total of 24 polishes gone and we only
have ten last time so we got rid of 14
of the blue ones I am so incredibly
happy guys this is what we're keeping so
far I just want to show you I just feel
like this looks so much fun and oh wow
I'm getting polish on myself this is so
much fun it's so like a curated
collection right like I don't have any
of the nasty colors I just have the fun
colors so excited we're gonna move on to
Pink's which is going to be probably my
hardest category but I'm
in the groove I'm in the mood let's do
it alright guys so we have all the
Pink's here these are every single pink
that I own so we're gonna go off and
pick the ones I know I love so first off
obviously the Lime Crime one I know I
know I know I'm keeping it I love this
pink it's one of my favorite ones
it's did a parfait day if you were
wondering I also really love the shade
castaway I think it is so so pretty this
is from Essie I love it if you were
wondering what these were at one point
when I'd use them I'd like put a little
thing on him so I knew that I had used
that in my collection and I never went
off and took them off so that's what
those are so you know I also like jelly
dance so pretty it's very similar to
castaway but like I don't care guys a
lot about you my all-time favorite like
OPI color I love this on the toes it's
so so pretty it'll make anyone's
jacked-up toes look so cute oh I love
OPI is not about you definitely keeping
that I also really loved this one from
Essie this is the color gogo geisha I've
talked about it a ton it looks so pretty
with like a really just plain
holographic or silver holographic polish
on it it's like such a perfect wedding
nail so I love that and keeping it I
also really enjoyed getting knotty on my
honeymoon which is kind of similar to
OPI is not about you but I don't care
I'm keeping it I think that's everything
I can pick from just like right front
off I do like boom-boom room
- I'm gonna swatch it though so I think
that's all I can do without likes
watching so I'm gonna re-evaluate these
I have a new piece of mail so that we
have a fresh swatch board for just the
pinks okay so I have a lot of these like
salmony Coralie colors I'm gonna do
those I used to really like a guy would
only wear corals when I was like in high
school and stuff but I don't really I'm
not like that now this is the color
sorry I'm fizzy today I think it was
from the coca-cola collection so that's
it they're really pretty it's watched
very nicely this is the color flip-flop
fantasy an all-time favorite I'm
probably keeping this one no matter what
just to have it like look it doesn't
even show up how neon it is it's crazy
okay I'm keeping flip-flop fantasy just
in case you need to be
on and then this one here is neon and on
and on and it's super pretty as well
it's just like a little bit more coral
so that was like kind of a bust I didn't
really do a good job let's pick a couple
of it corals this is butter London's
trout pout which was such a popular
color I picked this one up because of
Ingrid ooh look how much better it is
than the OPI okay I'm getting rid of the
OPI and I'm gonna keep this one hey I
got rid of one guys that's amazing
actually I'm gonna get rid of me on and
on and on it's so pretty but I know I
know
in my heart of hearts that this is gonna
be such a shitty color to put on my
nails so I'm just gonna get rid of it
and just keep the flip-flop fantasy this
one here is the color cereal shopper I
just already kind of don't like it I'm
gonna swatch it just to to go through
the motions oh yeah
so sheer not a pretty color I'm getting
rid of that these two look pretty
similar in the packaging one of them is
pink Friday which is from the Nicki
Minaj collection and this one is
flamingo teeny pink so let's see what
they look like swatch doubt so pretty I
just love pinks guys these are my
favorite colors to wear I love a cream
like baby to midtone pink on the nail
and then this one is pink Friday which
is probably the one I'm going to keep
yeah I'm keeping pink Friday I'm getting
rid of the Flamingo one these two are
kind of similar let's do that also this
is another one of those neon colors this
is shocking pink and it's like a true
pink though so I'm gonna keep that one
plus it's watched way better than neon
and on that was really sheer let's do
these two this is the color boom boom
boom which I think I love and then this
is cascade cool so cascade cool is
pretty I like it but boom boom boom is
just gonna be it's just so much better
I'm gonna keep boom boom boom I'm gonna
get rid of cascade cool this one is just
not very pretty either it's kind of like
a rosy neutral but it's one of those
ones I think maybe doesn't look pretty
in the container but like actually does
look nice on the nail
maybe I don't know I think I'm gonna
keep it actually let's go to some of
these ones up here this is the color
french affair from Essie it's very sheer
I think I'm gonna keep that actually I
don't think it's that that sure like I
think I could do two to three coats and
it's kind of pretty and soft this is
butter London's Teddy girl pretty sure
I'm keeping this I if I can remember
correctly it's really opaque it's so
pretty okay keeping that one you've
probably heard me say pretty like seven
hundred times and probably want to kill
me this is lying around from Essie I
also do like this one too it's like a
rosy nude I'm gonna keep that one this
is the color treat love and color you
know what I got this from a pinch me
unboxing I'm pretty sure yeah it's like
a sheer oh I love the brush though what
se just make all the brushes like that
please what's up with that oh gosh it's
just a sheer just get rid of this this
is stupi this one is pink ribbon and
this is more of like I feel like a
topper shade oh no it's just so sheer I
just I can't imagine if I'm going to
take the time to paint my nails I'm not
gonna paint it something sheer that just
looks like classic I'm going with like a
bright pink so I'm gonna get rid of that
one this is too taboo from Essie or
keeping that I like that I'm gonna keep
it I'm gonna swatch it next to this OPI
one just because this is pretty sheer
and I want to see oh yeah one's purple
ones like more pink these two are very
similar from OPI this is the color ella
fantastic pink and this one is from here
to eternity
so let's see the difference sounds like
a pretty strawberry pink and then this
one oh wow this one is like sheer this
one they're very similar Pink's but I
like the formula of this one actually
better it's way more opaque so I got rid
of that one these two are glitters they
have like a shimmer running through them
I really like this one your hutter mine
such a pretty rosy color love that I'm
gonna keep it
this one is a hoi from China
and this is not something I normally
wear but it's so pretty it has this like
pretty gold sparkle in it and I don't
know if I can get rid of it let's try
these Macbeth I love this is actually
more of like a reddish kind of color oh
I love it it's so pretty I don't really
like Reds but that one is beautiful and
then I have two here Primrose Hill
picnic and snog which I think snog means
to kiss or make out right and it's like
a British slang word right okay so
pretty not a color I normally have in
Pink's but it's so pretty and then this
one is just like your classic hot pink
so I think I'm gonna have to keep it -
yeah I do I gotta keep them okay I'm
gonna keep all of these ones guys not my
best round but I think considering that
it was Pink's it's pretty successful
I still got rid of eight guys that's
pretty good so let's move on to I'm
gonna do greens next cuz it's like the
next big category and then I'm gonna
combine reds and yellows next after that
so it gave up on the straight lines for
this we're just gonna get straight into
it I have my paper ready I'm also
getting my hand so painted up just so
you guys know okay this is the color
highlight of my summer from China Glaze
oh wow yeah that's bright can you see it
it's pretty I kind of like it and we're
gonna put it to the side I have a lot of
these like neon greens what's up with
that this is a jaded jack I really like
it though okay kind of cool a little bit
like slimy these two are so similar why
do I have to one is life gave me lemons
and one is did it don't know I probably
keeping the Nicki Minaj one you know I
like that one it wasn't as a pic as I
actually would hope sadly but this one
doesn't oh oh man and I like them both
they don't look different but when you
actually swatch them they are huh okay
I'm gonna keep those those are fun
this one I'm just gonna get rid of this
is the color vices versa
I'm keeping the illamasqua at color one
this is the shade mati I'm gonna keep
that one this is a color called fashion
playground from se I'm gonna get rid of
that one these two I have because it's
like when Christmas happens I just want
to have like one of those green nail
polishes so this is butter
London's British race car green it is so
pretty it's a cream which I love so if I
wanted to do just like a deep green
cream it'd be so pretty love that I'm
gonna keep it Wow I'm not getting rid of
any greens and then this one here is the
color winters Holly from China Glaze and
it is so so beautiful
like how pretty is that over a nail
polish really pretty right actually you
know what I said it was pretty and maybe
I'm lying to myself I'm getting rid of
it it's just not as spectacular like
look at that swatch it looks like poop
I'm getting rid of it these two I really
love I love this one bossy boots it's a
pretty pistachio like neutral color get
it I'm keeping that not getting rid of
it and this is trustafarian from butter
LONDON
this is a really interesting color
because it's actually like a holographic
and it's but it's green it's so
interesting I think I'm gonna keep this
one a little bit it's kind of ugly
though but it's holographic so I want to
keep it but it's kind of ugly but it's
holographic I'm gonna get rid of it okay
that was pretty good too guys alright
we're gonna just move on there should be
a number counter on the screen I don't
even come and edit this all out okay um
let's move on to Red's ish is and yellow
alright here are a picture of the Reds
and I guess some like purple berries I
don't know and then yellow and kind of
correlate oranges I'm gonna go with the
ones I want to keep first lime crimes
peaches and cream peaches cream that's
all it says I'm keeping that one I love
it I'm also keeping a coca-cola red from
OPI just such a classic red I love it I
don't normally have Reds if you can't
tell and then I'm also keeping Olay
Caliente
from Essie watch this is another one of
the rights I really really like in the
summertime it just looks so fun and fast
it's like has a little bit more about
like orange to it something I know I'm
gonna get rid of is this yellow from OPI
okay I got this into me from octal II
but the picture that was on there was
different than this color so I didn't
know I was getting this yellow I
probably wouldn't have picked it up had
I known that this was the color I was
getting I mean it said the name but I
just assumed the name correlated to the
picture that was up there
it looks opaque enough you know it's
just I'm not gonna wear a yellow like
this I don't think it's gonna look good
on my skintone it's just not something I
want so I'm gonna get rid of that I have
another yellow here this is butter
London's
cheeky chops and it's a bit more of a
pastel so I'm gonna keep it just to have
at least one yellow and I like this
color a lot more it's not as harsh this
is actually a really nice color from the
Sephora formula X polish I think they
got rid of these which I don't
understand why so pretty it's so a pig
it really goes on the nail nicely stayed
on a long time I'm gonna keep that color
these two are actually really similar so
this one here is the color wrapped in
rubies and this is butter London's shag
so I'm gonna swatch them next to each
other and see which one wins these are
both kind of like a metallic reddish
brown they could have gone in like a
million different categories I think I'm
gonna actually keep the butter LONDON
one because it has some sparkle to it
whereas the other one is just kind of a
metallic which is fine I just think I'd
prefer this if these two are so similar
but I'm not sure if I can get rid of
either one this is Bahama Mama from
Essie which is like a classic color so
pretty I know I want to keep that one
and then this one is from OPI and this
is Casino Royale from the James Bond
collection and it's like the same color
but I just want it to I'm gonna keep
both for now I know guys I know okay
this is butter London's Lamaze and it's
also the same color but darker it's a
darker oh why are these so difficult I'm
gonna keep that one I don't care I think
it's gonna layer darker that's what I'm
telling myself this is Midtown magic
from China Glaze and it's really pretty
it's like a black with like I actually
used this on
set for like a short film I did she used
this color on her nails
this is lubu heels from that's Coastal
Scents why do I want to call this in
China Glaze um yeah I'm gonna get rid of
lubu heels I'm also gonna get rid of
Midtown magic so we'll never use that on
set again and then this is Ruby pumps
and I think this I'm gonna keep for like
my glittery Christmas one because it's a
red with quite a bit of shimmer in it
and it'd be so pretty to like top over
stuff so I am gonna keep Ruby pumps okay
a very good very good I'm not as good as
I could have been but not as bad as I
could have been all right guys I counted
up my other nail polishes and I'm sure
you guys already saw this but I just
found out that I declared 40 nail
polishes already I am so close to my
goal I feel really pumped to you because
we have this category left and then
glitters which I want to be kind of
harsh on so I definitely think we're
gonna make our goal oh I found another
one we'll put that there
these are nudes and like black black is
here as well as metallic sheets so let's
get into it
first off I know I'm keeping this on
from OPI I really love it it's grin and
Barrett it's like a collection they did
with Ulta and it's such a good formula
such a pretty color very similar to gogo
get which I showed in the last one but
it's just so pretty definitely keeping
it love it I'm also keeping this gray
which is called now ins n from Essie
it's an amazing formula especially for
Essie that's some thing I'm realizing -
it'll be fun to go back and see what
times I'm getting rid of and which
formulas just aren't up to par but I
definitely want to keep this one I
really do like it I'm gonna keep the
black one because it's the only black I
have if I want to like layer glitters on
top or whatever I think this is a nice
one I also want to keep this one from
OPI which is called don't touch my tutu
it's very sheer but this is like the one
sheer one that I want to keep it's cream
it looks really pretty on the nails like
almost I don't know it's just it's a
really pretty one so I've used this
before I had a mini of it actually and I
liked it so much about the full size so
I'm gonna keep that all of these nudes
just look so ugly to me I'm gonna swatch
them this is the color all about that
base oh this is like a base this is a
base coat so I'm probably gonna keep
that actually
like that just an ugly color this is the
color cream tea from butter LONDON I
just yeah I'm not gonna keep that one
just because I'm keeping the OPI one the
two to one it's like very similar I'm
sure it looks nice on the nails and
whatnot and maybe if you had a darker
skin tone this would be better like cuz
it's a little bit warmer than the whiter
one but I don't need that this one here
is cocktails and coconuts this actually
probably does look really nice on the
nail I'm just gonna get rid of it I
think I want to keep it cuz it's
literally called cocktails and coconuts
like that's psycho it's out psycho but
you know what I mean it's just you know
let's get real these are all very
similar that's kind of like great Opie
type of shades they look really
different on camera but in person
they're not that's that different this
is fash pack which is a really nice
color from butter LONDON
I think that that China Glaze ones
really similar let me find that really
fast this is the China Glaze color it's
definitely a little bit oh you can't
even see it's a little bit lighter this
is the butter LONDON one out of the two
I think I actually like this one better
so I'm gonna get rid of the butter
LONDON one in Floyd Gras or however you
say that I love this one from butter
LONDON this is Wallace ah such a pretty
unique metallic shade so I'm gonna keep
that one
okay back to these two this is
chinchilla from FC which is like a
classic color it's okay this is Deborah
Lippmann's waking up in Vegas I'm sure
this one will be like ten million times
more opaque yeah I'm gonna keep the
deborah lippmann it's just like look at
the difference let me like look at the
difference that is good so irritating
let's move on these are the only two I
think I have left in the neutrals excuse
me well heck oh this one's Deborah
Lippmann oh yeah see and I was
considering keeping the coconut one I
think I'm gonna what color is this this
is the color shifting sands I think I'm
gonna keep it sometimes you want like a
good nude I have
even tried that one so maybe it's a good
new for my skintone and then this one is
hen party and it is such a pretty color
I know it doesn't look like anything but
you put it on top of something and it
like makes it shifting and cool so I'm
gonna keep that one though I will say I
am going to be very careful when we get
into glitter coats and top coats that
I'm not keeping a bunch of stuff that's
super sheer because I know I don't
normally like that so this is like the
one sheer one like that maybe a couple
others that I'm going to keep and if
anything I'm gonna go through and make
sure I keep only good ones okay we got
the metallics now this one here is
called I just spotted the lizard it was
from the spider-man collection and it's
one of those polishes that is so so
pretty in the container and I just I
can't be bothered to put it on my nails
guys does it look good over a black let
me try that I'm gonna try putting it
over a black to see if it's like I could
just do an opaque black and then put one
coat of that over it and be done so
that's what we're gonna do we're gonna
wait on that one or Lee's rage yeah
keeping it is so so good this one's also
really good from color club looks like
swatch them so we can kind of see what's
going on oh so pretty I'm gonna keep
that one I like it this one rage you
guys know is so good woohoo I really
like the handle it's like a grippy
handle and compared to the other ones it
is so nice this one from butter LONDON
it's the only one I've have the cap on
this is called the old bill let's see
it's really pretty but I don't need it
I'm gonna get rid of it this one is
really pretty from Sally Hansen it's
called coin flip I kind of feel like I'm
gonna keep it but let's swatch it next
to those other ones it's pretty I just
love those other two so much more so I'm
gonna get rid of this one as well I
really thought I was gonna keep that one
okay I have like two Goldie's and this
one's like a glitter gold so let's see
which glitter let's see which gold is
better oh yeah look at that that looks
like almost not like gold
looks more copper not weird huh okay I
like it though super opaque super pretty
this is your classic gold so they're so
different I mean they don't even look
the same at all so I'm gonna keep both
of those this one here is called
scuppered I think that's how you say it
from um butter LONDON it's really pretty
it really is I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna
keep it guys okay we got two more here
this one here is called gobsmacked from
butter LONDON it's like your classic
black with shimmer and I'm gonna get rid
of it I don't need this it's not that
great getting rid of it let's test this
now so I'm gonna put this over the black
and see so it turned green and that's
kind of it let's see I'll put it in
focus yeah I'm gonna get rid of it I
definitely don't need this color so I
pass it on I think it's one two that
like in the bottle looks so pretty and
then like with like the things but on
your nail in such a small area it
doesn't really transfer or translate as
well this is dodgy of barnett butter
LONDON and their crazy has the names
okay I put that over a different color
this is also like a holographic oh yeah
I'm gonna keep this one it's so pretty
guys I'm gonna keep it and then last
year I have your Royal shininess
it's from OPI this is like almost like a
liquid metal it's not necessarily opaque
but it's super glittery I'm gonna keep
it I don't really have any silver ones
okay so I'm keeping all of those
metallics I know I know so let's move on
to glitters cuz this is where I think we
can do some damage alright we have
arrived at the glitters these are all
like glitters top coats things like that
things that are sheer things that are
shiny
I love pink glitter if you can't tell so
some things I know I'm gonna keep I love
this so much it's probably one of my
favorite glitters ever tart with a heart
from butter LONDON highly suggest it
best ever so
I know we really like this one from when
while this is another one of those kind
of like sheer Stoppers but I want to
keep it I just really like this over a
purple nail polish also over Pink's it's
really pretty
Rose of Light is also so pretty so I'm
gonna keep that this is Muppets world
tour I'm gonna swatch this really fast
it's gonna be hard to see glitters
really but yeah I'm gonna keep them up
its World Tour cuz I really like that
this is the color pink yet lavender I
think I want to keep this too I think
focus what's going on this one isn't
super opaque I'm gonna keep it to the
side this is Katy Perry's Teenage Dream
one of the prettiest glitters ever ever
ever so pretty highly suggest if you can
find it I know it was limited edition I
don't want to just get rid of stuff
though to get rid of stuff I'm gonna
keep both of those I'm gonna get rid of
this one from as a shirt or something I
got this one I was working on the show
so me it was shooting at the PopSugar
studios so they have like all this free
stuff laying around there was like it
was like the second set guys I had like
food a cold kitchen you just go and eat
so anyway I'm gonna get rid of that I
got it for free there is what that story
was trying to boil down to love this
color from Maybelline this is the shade
lavishly lilac and I am so into it you
could wear this on its own or put it as
a topper so pretty this is something I
can get rid of this is the color
it's a trapeze it was from like the
Cirque du Soleil collection just a weird
one it's one of those ones it's like oh
that's unique but like it's unique in an
ugly way it just doesn't work I don't
like it I'm also gonna get rid of this
one I really loved this over like a
orange base for Halloween but like I
don't paint my nails for Halloween
anymore so I'm gonna get rid of it I'm
also gonna get rid of this one this is
the color glitter all the way and it's
really pretty it's just like a fun
glitter with a bunch of different colors
but I like lighter glitters I like
silvers and pinks light pinks I don't
want a dark glitter so I'm gonna get rid
of that this is another one of those
like toppers it's dream a little dream
of me and I kind of want to keep this
it's just pretty I'm gonna keep it I'm
gonna keep it but I'm gonna get rid of
this one
I'll get rid of this one this is the
color main squeeze from Essie and it's
one of those like yeah like white with a
purple reflex no reason to keep it
because it's basically sheer these three
are very similar so maybe I can boil
that down this one here from butter
LONDON is called Rosie Lee it's ok
whatever this one is you glitter be good
to me oh wow this one's getting chunky
but it's so pretty I really like that I
need to put some thinner in it before
it's gone I mean I can still shake it
it's just it's very thick with glitter
which is a good thing I like that and
then this one here is called glam this
is really pretty
but I feel like it's going to be the
worst thing I've ever seen to get off my
nails so I'm gonna get rid of glam even
though it's hard for me I'm gonna keep
Rosie Lee and the other dope yet these
two glitters and this one let's do these
this is the color luxe and lush oh gosh
it's so goofy y'all oh but it's so cool
I'm gonna send this out I think it's so
cool it's like a holographic bag got cut
up and your to put on your nails this is
the color beyond the mistletoe and it's
like a really cool green holographic I
kind of want to keep this too because
it's just so glittery and so holographic
we'll see this one I think I can get rid
of this is holographic - it's called
glitter and BJ I think I got this in
like Vegas with my mom and Sam but
there's nothing that makes me happy
about this color it's just not cute
getting rid of that I think I'm gonna
get rid of the mistletoe one - I've
never used it I just like it because
it's glitter this is a top coat called
not for individual sale no this is
called pure 18 karat white gold and
silver top coat Wow how fancy I know I
wanted this so so bad I was so excited
to get it definitely interesting I'm
gonna keep it mostly because it's a pure
18 karat point golden gold top coat this
one's really pretty from Essie it's
called on a silver platter I think I'm
gonna keep this one if I remember it's
pretty dang opaque yeah just cool that
one's a cool
I don't want this one at all I'm not
even gonna swatch it this is the color
called peak of chic it's pretty it's
fine whatever goodbye
I got some silver glitters this one
looks so pretty from butter LONDON it's
called fairy cake and it's holographic
it's very thick that I thought I would
really like this but it's just a little
dark I'm gonna get rid of it let's shake
this one up this is called which is
which and I think it was from The Wizard
of Oz collection that one's really
pretty and different I'm gonna keep that
one this one is from the OPI Nicki Minaj
and save save me yeah I've been trying
to save this polish from its jump own
demise but it's I don't think I think
it's done guys it's so pretty it has
like bark glitter in it and it's really
cool but it's just time to let it go
we're singing Disney we're not singing
Nicki on this and then last year this is
called silver lining from China Glaze
and it's just a silver classic silver
glitter really pretty really sparkly I'm
gonna keep that as well I have all of
these to go through these are all like
top coats base coats you guys don't
really need to see that I don't think
this video is long enough already if
you're still here bless your soul thank
you I'm gonna go through these and then
I'm gonna show you what I'm getting rid
of have the final tally and we'll do
some final thoughts alright guys so this
is everything I'm getting rid of 62 nail
polishes well I made my goal I was 12
over my goal of 50 which i think is
amazing so for sure I got rid of a third
of my collection it feels so good and
sometimes when I look back at this I'm
like oh that's pretty but I just have so
many more beautiful polishes that I know
I love in the stash that I'm keeping
it's amazing right now to know that I'm
under a hundred nail polishes if I don't
count my top coats and stuff
I'm definitely under a hundred nail
polishes and that feels so so good
looking at this you know I have them
sorted out by brands I have some like
China Glaze OPI se which there are so
many SES and I think that's something
I'm going to take it
to mind or like keep in mind with se is
like you know if I'm gonna buy anything
from them in the future I definitely
want to see some reviews I want to see
swatches I want to make sure it's a good
polish because I feel like a lot of
these are super sheer and I just don't
have the time and don't care about share
polishes I also have quite a few butter
London's I remember when I just went
crazy on the website bought about like
30 polishes at one time because they had
30 percent off yeah here they are you
know I used to think they were so cool
because they were a little more
expensive I love the name I love the
brand
all of it and you know it's once again
it's like buying colors that you like
that you're actually gonna wear I have a
lot of glitters in here too what you're
just cuz they're shiny and they get my
attention but I'm really happy with this
decluttr guys I hope you enjoyed this
video if you stayed for the whole thing
you are the best thank you for watching
I appreciate you guys so much really
happy can't wait to gift these away to
people and you know let someone else get
some joy out of them hopefully they'll
like them and use them more than I did
and that's everything bye guys I'll see
