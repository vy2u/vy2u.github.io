of an embarrassing video for me this is
gonna be my nail polish to clutter I
wasn't originally planning on doing this
but since I've been declutter a lot of
my makeup I thought then nail polish
also needs to be declutter my goal I am
actually sending a goal for myself to
get rid of a certain amount I want to
get it rid of at least 40 you know
polishes um whether they're big small
whatever just 40 of them that's my
target goal I'd feel really happy if I
could get rid of 40 but you know as much
as it seems like it'd be easy because
this is a lot of nail polish um I'm
still want to keep it I like it but I
have started project polish and this is
the reason why this isn't even counting
out the julep polishes I have which
that's what I'm project polishing um
it's mostly insane so I am going to just
start off I think most of the ones I'm
gonna probably be getting rid of are
gonna be like China Glaze just because I
really don't reach for my Tran glazes as
much as everything else but let's just
get into it I'm just going to be going
really fast through this I'm not gonna
read off every single color name I'm
mostly just looking at the bottle and
and saying yes or no or whatever so
let's get into it there's gonna be a
super long video so like grab a grab a
whole pizza I'm gonna be keeping like
any neon polishes from China Glaze that
I have so anything like that this one
I'm gonna keep this blue one I really
like I'm gonna keep that one too I have
two bladders here ones like red and gold
and ones like golden red I'm gonna put
these to the side so I can decide
between them later in case anything like
him comes up this is like a golden green
black color I'm gonna keep that I'm
gonna keep that one this is for Audrey
so I'm gonna keep that one it's like a
classic this is a silver color it's just
like a really fine silver glitter so I'm
going to keep this one and then if I
find another one I'm gonna decide
between them I really like this color
it's like dress me up from The Hunger
Games collection it's like a muted rosy
color I'm going to keep that this is
another
blue and a green color I'm gonna keep
those this color right here is called
hey doll I just am NOT into that color I
don't think I'll ever reach for
something like that and I probably have
something like it already so I'm going
to get rid of that one so we have one
down this is a really pretty like mauve
color what am I saying this is really
pretty like deep red color I guess I'll
keep that for now it's just like a neon
I'll keep that this is it's like a neon
pinky orange --red I'll keep that this
is called cowgirl up I'm gonna put this
to the side it's a really pretty color
but I think I might have something
similar and if I do I'm gonna get rid of
this one
I really like this one this is like a
fuchsia pink with like gold and shimmer
I'm gonna keep that this is like a
blueish shimmer I'm gonna keep those
these two are really similar to me the
ones cream and ones glittery I think I'm
gonna get rid of the glittery one um
that's something I'm trying to keep in
mind too while I do this I like cream
finishes more than like shimmery ones so
you know don't keep a bunch of shimmers
unless there's something really special
so I'm gonna get rid of the shimmer so
that's two down this is quite an
interesting color I'm gonna keep it for
now and it's gonna see I like this it's
like a periwinkle I don't know if I
showed you this one this one's really
pretty it's like a purple Sparkle I have
a really pretty like light like mint
blue color and then the orange one is
really pretty it's like orange and black
glitter perfect for Halloween I'm gonna
keep that this is electric pineapple
it's like a really electric color I do
have something kind of similar of by
this of this by OPI so I'm gonna keep
this to the side I like both of these
colors I'm gonna keep them I think this
is a really interesting nice colors
Harvest Moon I'm gonna keep that and
this is liquid leather it's just a black
so if I find another black I'm gonna
have to decide between which ones I want
but this is a nice one so I'll keep it
this is the color riveting I just don't
think I'm ever gonna reach for this I
think this is from The Hunger Games
collection I'm just gonna pass this one
along just because I don't need it I
don't think I'm gonna reach for it I
never have worn it since I got it sewn
so that's three down um I'm gonna keep
both of these for now I'm gonna keep
both of these as well um that purple is
really pretty I was like a golden Chi
and I'm gonna keep it for now but I'm
gonna keep it in two it just kind of
chunking out and then this is lubu Hill
heels and it's like a black in red color
if I keep that I really like it um a
blue shimmer and like a nice light blue
I'm gonna keep those those are colors
that gravitate toward this lemon color
I'm gonna get rid of I don't I don't
need a yellow color so that's four this
is a green sparkle I'll keep that one
this is a color called fast track I
don't think I really like it I'm gonna
get rid of this I think my coworker
you've it to me and she didn't like it
either and I don't want it I'm gonna get
rid of it that's five this is a yellow
glittery color I'm gonna get rid of that
I have this like kind of bluey teal
color I'm gonna keep it this is a purple
blue glitter I probably have something
like this but for now I'm gonna keep it
I'm also gonna keep this glitter I think
it's really pretty I'm gonna keep this
blue for now this is a very similar
color to like so many of the ones I have
so I'm gonna get rid of that smaller
type one
if I can find it oh I guess they are a
little different huh
I feel like this looks like Bahama Mama
but I'm gonna keep it I guess I don't
know this is really pretty red sparkly
color make it bad I got their green
sparkle here
I don't need both of these although
they're both pretty I'm gonna get rid of
this moment bluey green I think that
these two are very similar like they're
both gold and whatever so I'm gonna get
rid of I think this one yeah
so these are all keeping there's like no
room for these to go anywhere I hope
most of this video is not out of focus
but I'm gonna start just moving it to
whatever's closest to me these are se
ones I'm gonna keep those I'm gonna keep
these se ones as well and same with this
one
this blue Rhapsody is really pretty I
like that mentality that's color this is
ugly
this is tartufo I'm gonna get rid of
that I don't like it this is bare this
is better together and some green one
called mojito madness I'm gonna keep the
green one out because I know there's
some other ones like this one is called
first timer these are just so similar to
me I'm probably gonna keep I think I
want to keep first timer and get rid of
the mojito madness I have nothing else
metals it's like a purple and Shh
chinchilla I'm gonna keep the both of
those this is a really pretty color
called midtown magic it's like a black
with multi colors and I'm gonna keep it
this is super pretty I'm gonna keep that
batch I'm gonna keep both of those this
is lying around I really like this color
I use it a couple times this is under
the Twilight it's just a really pretty
dark color I guess I'll keep it this is

don't like it I'm gonna get rid of it I
got it for free when you purchase so
many so am I go to that this is mint

hopefully I don't have something I like
it this is really pretty lavender this
is the laces on I really like that this
is called over the knee I just don't
really like it I'm gonna get rid of it I
don't really wear a lot of brown colors
so I don't need that one I'm gonna keep
those I'm gonna keep these ones but I'm
gonna make sure I don't have another
color like this so I'm not gonna keep
any others that are like that type of
color I'm gonna keep these this is the
color neo whimsical I've never used this
but I'm gonna keep it just because with
cream like nude colors sometimes you
don't know what they're gonna look like
on you so I'm gonna keep it and then if
it's bad I'll get rid of it duh buh
I'm gonna get rid of I don't like the
name of it I don't like anything about
that polish I've never used it I'm gonna
keep both of these yeah I'm gonna keep
those I'm gonna get rid of all my little
mini ones just because I don't need them
I don't need those I've never used them

going to keep this these ones ooh this

pretty especially you had a tan I'm
gonna keep both of those I'm gonna keep

one I'm almost done with actually so I'm
gonna try to use this one more time and
kind of throw it in my project polish I
use it up because I was trying to before
I moved and I'm gonna try to finish it
this is like a Coastal Scents one it's
really pretty I've kept it for a long
time but I'm just gonna pass it I still
haven't used it even though I've kept it
over and over so get rid of that one
we are making progress guys oh my gosh

lavender Purple's I like Pink's
basically any fun colors if it's a fun
color I want it these I'm gonna keep as
well even though I don't really like no
I do like this one I thought it was like
this one is really pretty but it's
similar to another one these two are
like almost identical it's crazy so I'm
gonna get rid of this one and keep the
coastal I mean keep this China Glaze one
this one I'm gonna keep it's like an
orange glitter this is like that se one
they're very similar um I honestly think
I like this one better I'm gonna get rid
of the SE I like this one and I also
really like this black with gold glitter
on this one I just got and I really like
it these I'm going to keep I got this
for Christmas in that box and I don't
really have too many colors like this

like an egg it's really pretty and I'm
gonna keep this like mint color because
I can't turn out to a mint Dee's I'm
gonna keep as well.this I'm gonna keep

glitter but I've had it for so long I'm

a million minutes I'm keeping these I'm
keeping these ones this is Deborah
Lippmann's I don't know why it looks so
sick um I'm gonna keep this deborah

keep those this one I'm also going to
keep it's called
glitter and Begay I really love that I'm

that I'm keeping this pop nail polish
it's really pretty I'm gonna keep both
of these colors they're really cute I'm
also gonna keep these ones from OPI I'm
gonna get rid of this Rimmel one just
because I have so many Purple's not
because it's bad or anything it's just I
don't need that many repeats of it I
mean I already have too many repeats but
one less as I guess better than keeping
it
these are butter LONDON I'm probably not
gonna get rid of any of my butter LONDON
so I'm gonna keep those I'm gonna keep
both of those colors I don't know if we
ran out of memory space but we gotta
hurry through this my camera's freaking
out so keeping all
I'm gonna keep all my butter LONDON ones
basically so keeping all those okay guys
so my camera is being really funky right
now I don't know why I have gone through
the rest of those polishes and I was
able to get rid of all of these I feel
really happy I got rid of so many there
are 42 polishes in here so I hit my goal
of at least 40 I was pulling teeth at
the end there but I'm really glad I did
it because I really won't miss these
polishes like once I put everything back
and these are out of my collection I'm
not gonna miss them so I'm so glad these
are gonna be gone and I think that that
is everything guys thanks for sticking
to watching all these videos I will make
a playlist of all my decluttering videos
but I'm not going to declutter for a
while now and hopefully I'll update my
makeup inventories in the next couple of
months so we can kind of see some
progress of what I've done just by
decluttering but I hope that you enjoyed
this video I hope that this whole series
kind of gave you the courage or the
determination to either you know
rediscover your collection and decide to
use stuff up or get rid of it and pass
things on that you don't love I will see
you guys in my next video
