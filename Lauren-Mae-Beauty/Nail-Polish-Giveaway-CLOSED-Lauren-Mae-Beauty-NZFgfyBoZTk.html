video is all about the giveaway I'm
doing a giveaway this is the first
giveaway I've ever done on my channel
and it is going to be a huge nail polish
cowboy I believe there are 42 nail
polishes here that i'm giving away i'll
show you a little overview i have a lot
of nail polishes i recently went through
and declutter my collection and these
items are things that i am well it's all
nail polish so all the nail polish items
these are all things that i have decided
to part with and i didn't know what to
do with them I live in California and I
just moved here so I thought you know
instead of sending these to family what
you've already given them so much nail
polish because I have slowly been
weeding through my collection over like
a year and a half or so I thought though
I would do a giveaway with these things
so these are like used to be my own
collection I didn't go out and buy all
these for this giveaway but most of them
honestly have never been used or if they
have it's been like one time again I
will link my nail polish to clutter
video and you will see that I have a ton
of nail polish and that is no
exaggeration so i'm going to show you
guys each of these colors individually
so that way you guys can kind of get an
idea of what they are the rules for the
giveaway I don't really want to have
like too many rules I just you have to
be subscribed to my channel I think that
ones mostly given in every type of
giveaway so just be subscribed to the
channel and then the only other thing
you have to do is leave a comment down
below and the comic can say anything it
can say like enter me it can say what
your favorite nail polish was you can
say whatever you want basically all
you're doing with putting that common in
there is making sure that only people
who want to be part of the giveaway are
a part of the giveaway not just all my
subscribers that way potentially it's a
smaller pool and people who actually
want to win it are more likely to win it
than just like anyone who subscribed to
each so make sure you do that and then
that's really it I'm gonna pick the
winner randomly I don't know how you do
that I think there's like some type of
site you can go on them and a look into
that but it will be random I'm not going
to pick like a favorite or the first
person who comments or anything like
that so it will be random whoever
comments on the video and it's also
subscribed to my channel and I am going
to pick the winner two weeks after
posting this video so i will put the
date on the video itself into the
description bar all the information will
be linked down there if you forget in
this video i will personal message the
person who wins i'm going to be doing
this giveaway for anyone so if you live
in the united states or if you live
somewhere else in the world definitely
still do it everyone's open to win it so
i hope that you guys are potentially
excited to win it a lot of these brands
there's a mean a variety of brands again
all the information will be listed down
below and i will get into individual
just like showing you the colors like to
music or something so you guys can see
those and i will see you in my next
video bye guys good luck to everyone
you
you
you
Oh
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
