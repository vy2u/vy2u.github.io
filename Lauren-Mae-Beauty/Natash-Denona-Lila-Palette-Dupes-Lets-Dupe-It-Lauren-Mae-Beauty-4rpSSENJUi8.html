Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another let's
do Padres love these and a house I don't
know I feel like a million times if you
guys wanted me to do the natascha - no
no legal palette which I did actually
buy so this litte stupid is me
comparing shadows to the actual shades
in this palette if you haven't seen the
inside of it this is what it looks like
SuperDuper beautiful if you haven't seen
this series for me before this is where
I go through my collection I find the
single shadows that I feel like match
the shades in a palette that's coming
out and try to basically create the
spirit of that palette without having to
buy it and looking into my collection
and finding similar shadows that I
already own I had a couple people
mentioned in my last video that single
shadows like if I bought all the single
shadows it would be more money and that
is very very true one of the perks of a
palette is the fact that you will
usually save money and get all those
shades before cheaper than if you bought
them individually the reason I like
doing this with single shadows is if you
already have single shadows at home you
don't have to buy those ones you can
also go into your collection and go into
other palettes that you have at home and
see if you have similar shades in there
for me what's nice is that if you liked
only a couple shades in a palette you
could find any of these individually and
go by that specific shade to add to your
collection I also like single shadows
because again you can configure them in
the exact same order as the palette
which I think a lot of the times is what
is the most inspiring things at some
point we're gonna run out of the shades
to have there already have all been done
so I feel like something that really
spices up a palette is the configuration
or the inspiration behind these shades
that they've chosen to put into that
palette and I can best recreate that by
being able to move them next to each
other since color is so relative it can
really change how a palette looks these
videos are not exact dupes so if that's
what you're looking for it's not gonna
happen the reason I asked you guys like
a million times if you wanted me to do
this is because nothing in my collection
really compares to the shadows in here
I don't have a review on this yet I will
be getting it up soon I'm sorry it's
just taking a lot of time I've been
really busy with work and everything so
I will be getting that to you soon but
regardless the shadows in here they're
just they have something special to them
that I couldn't quite do and I think
also having the palette here I can
actually get as close as possible
whereas if I'm just comparing two
swatches I see online it's easier to say
a shadow looks like it if it's not right
next to it anyway I think that's
everything check out my other videos the
playlist will be linked down below if
you want to see other palettes that I've
done also leave any suggestions for
palettes and I think that's it let's
just get in to the freaking shadows
shall we I've already kind of shown this
this is my palette I'm missing a few
shades and there's a couple reasons for
that we'll get into them as we go the
first hour we're going to talk about is
going to be the dupe for per se and for
that I chose the shade bedrock from
makeup geek this one is a lot more gray
than per se in the Natasha Ginetta
palette but it's as close as I had in my
collection something that is really
tricky with the Natasha Genova palette
and the max in there is that they look a
lot lighter than what they actually
swatch out to and how they translate
onto the eye so although some of these
colors may not look right next to them
they definitely translate a little bit
better once you actually swatch them out
I feel like this color ties in really
nicely with my palette that I've created
because it is cooler toned and I don't
know I don't think this palette is that
cool toned the more that I use it there
are a lot a lot of warm shades in here I
mean there are some cool shades but
there are a lot of warm shades and so
this one is nice for some of the purples
in there to give a base so that's my
first do the next shadow we want to talk
about is the dupe for viola in the
palette now I don't have it with me and
I don't understand where is I've been
searching my collection everywhere I
cannot find the shadow and I think I've
misplaced an entire like self-made
eyeshadow palette with a bunch of
singles in it and I'm really heartbroken
about it but the color that I think is a
dupe for diz masquerade for a makeup
geek this is such a pretty color I'm
going to have a picture of it on the
screen somewhere I've also featured it
in so many of my other LUT stupids
the peanut butter and jelly palette from
Too Faced it's very similar to the
purple in that palette it's a purple but
it's warm toned instead of cool toned
I love Purple's like that I think
they're just so pretty and fun you guys
know I love pink and it's like the
closest variation to pink you can get
without being pink
so that is my deep I don't have any
bonus shades for that I actually don't
have a lot of bonus shades in this
entire thing I think because I have a
palette with me I don't need a bunch of
you know variants the next color in the
palette is Amara
and the dupe that I have for that is the
color cherry cola from makeup geek these
look very different from each other
because this looks a lot darker but
again Amara translates so much darker
than what it looks like in the palette
and I'm actually really happy with this
dupe I think it's very very similar this
one you almost have to build up a little
bit to get it to look exactly like the
other shade but it has a nice like ready
purple undertone to this Brown that
really translates very similarly to that
color on the eyes the next shade and the
Natasha's didn't own a palette that
we're duping is cyclone and I'm actually
really happy with this one too this is
the color red stone from Coastal Scents
the hard part about cyclone is that it
has this kind of duochrome to it so it
looks really red in the pan but when you
swatch it it kind of shines this like
pinky orange it's really really pretty
it's a more of a subtle type of
duochrome but it's beautiful and this
shadow actually replicates that quite
well it doesn't have the same amount of
shine but it is very very similar and I
really like the quality of this shadow
as well so I do highly suggest this one
in place of that if that's the color
that you're going for again there's just
something about the Natasha to known as
shadows that they're just in a league
all their own this isn't me getting into
a review exactly but there's no denying
that when you swatch these out unless
you're trying to find something that is
an exact dupe but if you're just going
through your collection you're probably
not gonna have anything quite like
exactly like it it's probably not the
next shadow that we're duping from the
palette is nude vino and I have two
shades for this so the one that I
originally picked and I think is the
closest is the shade earth Rose from
Coastal Scents
this is really pretty it doesn't
translate quite as dark as nude vino
does it has a little bit of that rosy
tone to it which looks very similar to
the shadow in the palette but for my
bonus shade I chose little boat this one
has a little bit more warmth to it it's
not as similar you guys will see in all
of these swatches but I just wanted to
give a second option honestly with these
mats you could choose anything you want
and that's something I really like about
the let's dip it's Erie's is it really
makes you take a hard look at a palette
and what is actually different about
this palette because as a whole it's a
lot to consume but when you start
breaking it down shade by shade you
realize that there might only be three
or four colors that are really what
you're gravitating to or what you really
want but the rest of it you probably
already have in your collection and if
you're someone who is trying to kind of
downsize your collection or just you
know make sure that you're using
everything that you have you might not
want to double up or triple up as you
buy more palettes instead you might want
to just pick and choose the really fun
pops of color that you have a palette
anyway let's move on to the next shades
next is the shade Layla and for that I
chose chocolate berry from Coastal
Scents this one was really difficult for
me to try to do it has this depth to it
that I don't have in a lot of the other
singles in my collection this one was
the most similar this does have a bit of
a purple undertone to it which isn't
what the original Shadow has but I feel
like it fits really well with the
palette and I do have some bonus shades
for that shadow as well these ones are
going to give you more of the same tone
to the Layla shadow in the palette but
they don't have the depth so the first
one here is the color Dragonfly from
colour-pop this is one of the shadows
from their newer set of singles that
came out this one's really really pretty
it doesn't have quite as much of a shine
to it it's like a nice satin but I think
that one's really similar and then
another one here is makeup geeks
grandstand this has a little bit more of
a metallic finish to it but again it
doesn't quite have the depth it just has
more of that tone next in the palette is
amethyst and for that I chose Caitlin
rose from makeup geek this is a really
beautiful shadow it's similar to
masquerade but this is the cool toned
purple version
instead of the warm-toned I do have this
on my I look today and I forgot to tell
you but I will have a demo at the end
here for you guys to see how I created
this look using the shadows I really
like this one but this one is not nearly
as pigmented as the one in the palette
you just definitely have to build it up
and even then you don't quite get the
same depth this was just as similar as I
had but honestly to me they don't quite
compare if you were really wanting
something that purple and that pigmented
next is one of my favorite shades and
the whole palette and it's because it's
pink that is the shade magnetic and I
don't have a single shadow actually that
works well to dupe it that's in a pot
form to go in my Z palette but I do have
one from kiss this is the shade dahlias
and this is actually very very similar
these retail for $4 a piece though it's
a great deal I actually do have a whole
look using this this is a nicely
pigmented shadow it's not going to
compare to the natascha - no no one but
if you're looking for something that is
more affordable this one is nice and
gives you a very very similar look
the natasha's no no one again has just
more of a shine to it it just looked
more spectacular it just does I feel
like you know when she talks about
having the crushed up pearls and stuff
you can see it when you starts watching
your shadows next to it you can see that
extra sparkle that the pearls and
whatever else she puts into these
shadows give the next shadow in the
palette is Magnolia and this is the
really pretty like rich gold shade this
is a very yellow gold but it has a
little bit of orange thrown in it was
very very difficult for me to get an
exact dupe for this the closest thing
that I had in my collection was the
color gold coast from the brand itse I
really really hope that they still have
this shadow available I didn't check
before I film this I'm sorry but if you
have this at home it's very very similar
I do have a couple bonus shades though
this one here is saltwater from
colour-pop this is a lot more Orange as
you can tell but this has a nice like
duochrome to it so if you're wanting to
pull out more of that orange gold this
one is a nice alternative and if you
were looking for something that wasn't
maybe as yellow but still gold I was
considering makeup geeks magic act to
put in here but it just it's definitely
a bit lighter so if you like that better
than a really yellow gold you might like
that some of the colors in the color
puck
yes please palette though we'll give you
a similar look not exact but similar and
any of us like yellow golds will be a
great dupe for that color next we're
getting into the last matte in the
palette and that is nude mauve again so
difficult for me to freakin dupe these
colors I thought it would be so much
easier for my dupe I chose Mac's kid I
believe this is discontinued now that I
was thinking about it when I was doing
my eyeshadow I was like oh crap I think
this is discontinued but if you have
Mac's kid this one is really similar and
like I was saying the mattes in here
just translate so much darker and
they're so hard for me to use as a
transition because I am so fair so for
me and my you know self created palette
I really wanted to throw in a shade that
I could use as a transition and this one
is so so nice again you could use
anything that you have or if you know of
any really good dupes for nude mob and
the palette definitely leave them down
below but I really like this as an
addition to my palette because it gives
it a softer look and it makes it more
wearable for me everyday
the next color and the palette to dupe
is you know I think that's how you might
pronounce it and for that I chose
starry-eyed from makeup geek this is
such a blinding just so metallic color I
think it works really well the one in
the palette has a little bit of like a
pink tone but it's kind of a cool toned
pink this doesn't quite have that
pinkness or coolness to it but it's very
similar and just so beautiful on its own
I thought it was a really nice addition
to this palette you also could use
makeup geeks whimsical that shadow is
also missing from my collection again I
think it's in outer space or wherever
that palette is missing so you could
also use that if you have it at home
alright we're moving onto livid in the
palette and this one was so hard guys I
had nothing similar this is just like an
entirely kind of whatever I wanted to do
at this point because I have nothing
quite with that purpleness
and that depth and just that sparkle
nothing in my collection even kind of
compares but the color I chose to
incorporate into my palette is double
date from colour-pop this is super
pretty it's what I have on my lid today
I really like this
it's nice and purple it's a lighter
purple though so it works well with the
other Purple's in the palette this is
where we get into the inspired by part
the next color in the palette is pur
pure and I have a couple shades to dupe
that one the first one here again
another color pop this is pinkie promise
such a beautiful shade this has been in
a lot of my other palettes as well and
that's something that I'm realizing when
I have the same shadows in my let stupid
I'm realizing like oh my gosh if I
bought that palette and that palette and
that Palin matte palette it's like I
have the same burgundy color and
everything the slight variations usually
don't really translate on the eye very
well so this one's a really great dupe
for pur pur so hard to say I feel like
I'm Tyler Perry so um and the cheaper
dupe even that I have is from Coastal
Scents and this is the shade raisin
berry this one is not quite as red it
has a little bit more purple in it but
you will see in the swatches that
they're all very very similar you can
see a difference but again on the eye
they're gonna look more or less the same
the next shade is the absolute hardest
one they want to have nothing to compare
it to I'm so sorry I had someone
specifically asked me for a dupe for
dragon fight and I just don't have it
guys the color and the palette is just
so it's so individual it is a red but it
has like this green it's very very
beautiful I don't find that the
duochrome
quite translates as it does in the pan
into a swatch or even on the eye I feel
like a lot of that red comes out and to
build up that green is a little bit
difficult so I decided to kind of again
put my own twist on it add my own thing
and I put in the color Teegarden from
colour-pop again this is one of the
newer individual shadows you can see the
flash of green on this quite well but
this has that red but you actually see
that green over a base I think this
would look really pretty
and although they're not similar they
have the same colors in it it's just
they don't show up in the same way I
hope that helped if you guys know any
dupes for Dragon by definition before
anyone who was looking for that specific
shade anyway enough of that let's move
on to the last shadow in this palette
and that is the color Helio for my dupe
I have the color high strung from
colour-pop if you can't tell it love the
color pop shadows I think they're so
good for the price that's something that
I'm going to talk about my review but I
guess I'll just build the beans a little
early I love more inexpensive makeup
that performs well I gravitate to that
that's what I like to use with what I
get excited about so I wanted to try
this Natasha janata palette because I
mean you've heard so many amazing things
about it and although these shadows are
beautiful and like I said a million
times they don't compare quite to
anything else in my collection to me
this gets me more excited because I know
I didn't drop like freaking my car
payment on it anyway enough about this I
think this compare is really really well
to helio in the palette it has a slight
difference but this one is I mean when
you swatch them next to each other this
one does have a similar shine it feels
just as pretty and feels just as good to
swatch and to use so highly suggest this
shadow from colour-pop so good I think I
just deleted footage that I needed but
anyway the bonus shadow that I have for
Helio and the palette is grandstand this
is very very similar to high strong it's
maybe just a little bit gold it doesn't
have as much rose gold into it but it's
so so similar and very very beautiful
again it has that same like shine and
just quality to it I feel like um as
opposed to paying the price for the
Natasha - no no way I hope you guys
enjoyed those dupes and I will show you
guys some swatches now just so you can
see just swatches and comparisons coming
up and then we will move into the demo
if you want to stay tuned for that other
than that I'll see you in that part of
the video
alright guys let's start this demo we
are going to be using shades from the
natascha - no no lilo palette my lids
dupit though I am excited I want to do
something with purples today that's kind
of where I want to go with it because I
don't have Masquerade which you guys
already know about earlier in this video
I might pull into this shade here just
to have that purple to use for this look
but you could always use whatever your
dupe is at home but I suggest masquerade
anyway I'm not even sure yet we'll get
there when we get there first thing I'm
gonna do though is I am gonna go into
this shade here I believe this is max
kid you could use soft brown or any
transition color whatever works for you
the reason I put this in the palette
which again you guys already know about
is because I I needed something that was
actually light enough for transition all
the shades in the Lila palette are a
little bit too dark to use as a
straight-up transition like just to go
straight in with so this one works
really well for me for that purpose
yeah I am I'm going into this shade from
the palette so I'm going in with viola
which is the warmer purple shade I am
just going to start putting that in the
outer corner now that I have my
transition buffed out I really want this
to be a fun purple look so I'm gonna
take this about 2/3 of the way into the
eye and you can be a little bit rough
you guys know how I am with my colors I
like to I like more of a blown-out look
than something super structured I'm
gonna go back in and just start blending
that out into the transition next I'm
going to go in with the shade Caitlin
rose from makeup geek as the other
purple shadow and I'm just gonna start
working that into the outer portion of
the
I really want this to look purple and
not pink because I feel like I do a lot
of pink on my channel and uh we all know
what that looks like on me tonight I am
bringing that into the crease as well
I'm going back in and just blending out
I have no product on my brush or no more
product I should say I want to lay down
some shadow on the inner portion of the
eye so I'm gonna go in with this color
here which is my do for the lightest or
lighter purple in here which is called
livid I'm gonna go in with the shade
double date from colour-pop and I will
be wetting my brush with mac fix+
just to make sure it goes on as like
nice and metallic as possible I'm really
liking the look of that I feel like I do
have a bit of fallout going on so I'm
just brushing that away I do want to go
in with this shade here this is
chocolate berry or chocolate raisin or
chocolate berry from Coastal Scents and
I'm just going to use that to give even
a little bit more depth to the outer
corner I have a little bit more Brown
blended up here so I'm gonna go in here
and kind of blend with that original
transition that we had and then I'm
gonna go back in with Caitlin rose and
just try to make sure we still have that
nice and cool toned purple really
visible alright I really really like
that so I'm gonna go in with this shade
here this is makeup geeks starry eyed
I'm gonna be putting that on the inner
corner as my highlight for under the eye
we're gonna start off with the shade a
kid and we're just going to build that
up I'm then gonna go back into the
actual Natasha janata palette again use
whatever dupe you have and I'm gonna go
in with that violet viola shade and I'm
going to blend out even more with that
next we're gonna go in with the Caitlin
Rose shadow and really try to punch that
in closest to the lash line basically
we're just doing what we did on the top
unless we're going in with chocolate
berry and keeping that on the very outer
corner I'm also going to make sure to
take the color starry-eyed and really
bring it and mesh it with the lower lash
line so we have that brightness there
and this is not me foiling it but you
definitely could to get an even brighter
look I'm gonna go in with some liners
I'm gonna go in with some liners I'm
putting the white one on my waterline
and I'm going to tightline with the dark
brown just to give my lashes some
definition and I actually had quite a
bit of fallout so I went and concealed
that and said it so I would suggest you
in your eyes first laughs I'm gonna go
in with some mascara this is Urban
Decay's perversion and I will show you
guys the final look all right guys this
is the final look I really hope you
enjoyed my lip product is just a byte
pencil in the shade number 22 I'm not
sure I will leave it listed down below
so you guys know and other than that
that is everything I hope you guys
enjoyed this let's stupid I know it
wasn't nearly as similar as some of the
other Lutz stupids I've done but I still
think it's really fun to go into your
collection and find things that are
inspired by a certain palette even if
they aren't the exact same you can get
very very similar looks on the eye and
be inspired in the same way and have
just as much fun with your makeup as you
would with maybe a different palette or
a more expensive palette anyway that is
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
