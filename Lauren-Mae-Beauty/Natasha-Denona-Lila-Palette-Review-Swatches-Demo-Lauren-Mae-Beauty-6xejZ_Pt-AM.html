learn thank you so much for watching
today we're finally doing it I'm finally
giving you guys my review on the
Natasha's no no Leela palette it has
taken me forever to get this review up
and there are a few reasons for that one
I really wanted to test this palette out
I wanted to use it in multiple
situations really get a feel for it this
is a very very extensive palette and
it's my first one from Natasha de Nonna
so I wanted to be able to get you guys
some really good information back so you
could decide if this was something that
you wanted to try out if it was
something that you wanted to add and
invest it into your collection and I
also feel like I put a lot of pressure
on myself to do that for you guys and
you know like I'm not someone who loves
like recommending products to you guys a
ton of times because it's like I don't
want you guys to go out and get
something and then be unhappy with it
like that's a really big like fear of
mine that I'll recommend I'm thinking
you guys just hate it and then like you
know and I'm the reason that you bought
it like I don't know there's like a fear
of mine for that so I'm with this
palette and it being such a high ticket
value I've put a lot of pressure on
myself to come out with something that's
really thorough and I think that that
has made me kind of overthink things and
just like kind of not want me to get
this review up in a lot of ways too so
anyway thought I would just throw that
out there I'm gonna try to keep this
pretty short and simple I feel like I've
talked about this palette a lot in just
different videos I've done a whole lot
to do pathan this palette so if you want
to know my dupes
for the Natasha generally lo palette
I'll leave that video link down below
but anyway I think we should just get
into it this is what the palette looks
like if you haven't seen it and on the
inside this is what it looks like I'm
gonna get into the review right now I'm
gonna have swatches after that and then
I will have the demo at the end I use
this palette to create this look today
so if you want to know how to get it
that will be at the end of the video
starting off with the most effective
fact facts at the beginning this palette
retails for a hundred and twenty nine
dollars it has 15 different shades in it
there are 4 different types of finishes
in this palette they're the creamy
mattes the chroma crystals the metallics
and then she also has the duo crumbs in
here so the format's are per se which is
here this is a
this is nude vino and this is nude mauve
the only chroma crystal which is
supposedly like a top coat is this one
here which is Magnolia it's like a gold
shimmer there are three different do
crumbs in this palette this is cyclone
up here this is the shade livid and this
one here is dragon's bite and then the
rest of the shades are considered for
metallic finishes I know a lot of people
try to justify the price of this palette
by breaking down price per gram and
saying that you're getting so much
product for the price but for me I don't
care about that so I am someone who
loves makeup but I also like to keep my
collection like more minimal it's
definitely not but I don't like to buy
everything that comes out and I don't
like to consider myself a collector I
don't buy things to sit on the shelves I
buy things to use them
I also project pan which means that I
like to try to actually use up the
makeup that I have I don't want it
sitting there I try to use it up before
it expires and so for me getting a
massive amount of product and being
charged a lot of money for that it might
be a great value for other people if
that's how they like to justify it but
for me all I think is like well I would
have rather had the palette cost less
and make it half the amount of products
I don't I'm never gonna go through any
of these eyeshadows in my whole life so
I'd way rather have half the product
which is still gonna go to waste
probably and pay about half the price I
don't I don't need all the product you
know like that isn't a reason for me to
want to spend it it doesn't help me
justify anything so for me I really wish
that these shadows were smaller and that
she would lower the price I know she has
done that from her original huge
palettes this one and the sunset palette
are definitely the most affordable when
it comes to a larger palette of hers and
I do appreciate that but I wish that
they would get even smaller put less
product in there it's okay
no one's going through it I'm gonna be
on to the next palette I'm gonna want
newer things and there's no way I'm
going to get the money's worth 129
dollars out of this palette probably
ever unless I really pan this for like a
whole year really fast - I did want to
point out the package
this is it I think it looks nice there's
a part of me that does like the
simplicity of it you know I'm someone
who is a fan of cardboard packaging this
isn't it's like almost like a foam and
this is almost like a leather type of
feel but I do think that this palate
feels cheap for how expensive it is I
can see like the foam in here I don't
like that the names are on this insert
paper instead of actually like printed
on the packaging I really wish she would
have done that just you know like I can
see the foam I just feel like for the
price I'm paying for like a really
luxury thing and I don't think the
packaging necessarily shows that I also
think it gets quite dirty no matter how
much I try to clean it it still looks
dirty so that's just something it's not
like a deal breaker for me but it's just
it's just a point I wanted to make and
now when it comes to the eyeshadows are
they worth the money I think that's
probably the biggest question everyone
has for me these shadows are not worth
the money they are really expensive I
just I honestly don't think that there
are any shadows out there that are worth
so how much it's just so much money guys
it's so much money and you're basically
paying for a name I know that these are
supposed to have like higher quality
ingredients just plus I like crushed up
pearls and there's no denying that a lot
of these shimmers are absolutely
beautiful but for me I don't think that
even that spectacular aspect of these is
worth the money I would way rather use
my color pop eyeshadows I'm just I
gravitate to those I'm drawn to those
palettes more than I am to this palette
and those are sixteen dollars and so
when I want to use those palettes over
this there's a problem you know and it's
not a problem with the palette it's just
for me personally it's not it's not
worth it I'm not I'm not treating this
palette any better because it's worth a
hundred and twenty dollars or 130
dollars so then that makes me think like
I totally could have done without this
palette and would have been a lot more
happy to have other other things so
formats I do like the mattes in here
they're really pigmented they're really
soft with the mattes though I do find
that this one here per se as well as
nude mauve they look lighter in the pan
but because they're so
pigmented they go on my eye a lot darker
and I am obviously more fair so that
makes this palette no matter how I try
to use this it turns out really dark
like this is like the most neutral light
look I can really get and although I
think this is a very beautiful look I am
the everyday like something a little bit
lighter a little bit more easy to work
with and since these mats are so
pigmented I just find that it's not just
like easy simple get your makeup done
and go this palette for me is definitely
something where I'm like dressing up I'm
doing something fun I'm taking more time
with my makeup and that's great and all
but for it being the price that it is I
really wish it was an everyday palette
for me and everyday staple something
that I was reaching for all the time and
it's not when it comes to the metallics
in here I think most of them are really
nice but the color viola as well as the
color magnetic they have almost a
scratchy quality to them when I feel
them in the pan and they I don't know
they're very chunky like they pick up a
lot of product and that's something that
I don't love I also find that these
shadows aren't that metallic compared to
other metallics in the palette so that's
a bit of a bummer to me I don't know I
just feel like quality wise those feel
like so many other shadows that I have
like more why were those so expensive
this shade down here is as you know and
it is not considered a chroma crystal
which I feel like it should be because
it is a sheer color it's considered a
sheer metallic and it's okay it's just
not my favorite I really wanted to like
that shade more than I do I find it's
hard to like build up the pigmentation I
want something a little bit more intense
I would have rather didn't be just like
a straight-up metallic that's super
creamy super blinding I think that would
have been absolutely beautiful afford
the one chroma crystal eyeshadow that's
in here Magnolia that is one of the best
metallics in the whole palettes and
that's kind of confusing to me this one
swatches beautifully it goes on the eye
beautifully it's so pigmented it's so
creamy I don't get any type of like I
don't know it doesn't feel like a topper
um it's just so smooth I just I don't
know I mean all of these are a little
bit I guess you could say a lip
chunky but that one is just so so
beautiful I love that shape going back
to the mats really fast before we move
on to the duochrome shades I thought I
would really like these colors because
there's something different but I find
that both the lighter shades look a
little bit muddy on my eyes I just don't
love the tones on my specific skin tone
and my eye color they're not my favorite
they don't look ugly and this look is
really pretty today but they definitely
don't translate as warm as I feel like
they shed they always just look a little
bit darker a little bit more cool toned
almost gray like a great inch to them
than I expect and that's something that
I don't really love even this one helio
is what I have on the lid today with as
you know topped over it and this is a
bit dark on me it doesn't look like it
will be like in the pan I think it's
gonna be a little bit lighter but then
when I put on the lid it's pretty dark
anyway moving on to the duo crumbs oh
they're my favorite finish in the entire
palette I feel like the shadows in here
that are with that finish are the the
most beautiful the most pigmented I
think they're the most unique and
they're the things that I would if
you're going to spend the money on the
shadows they're probably the most worth
it to me so Cyclone is absolutely
beautiful this is a copper with a pink
shift this is the color livid and it is
a lilac with like a blue silver shift to
it this is probably the least duochrome
looking but it's absolutely beautiful
and stunning and then this one here is
dragon's bite and it is a red with a
green shift to it and that one is so so
beautiful so overall those are kind of
my thoughts in the palette I'm gonna put
up some pictures here of the looks that
Natasha de Nonna has done with this
palette and they're all very very
stunning every single time I've used
this palette I just feel like it has to
be kind of a show and I think that her
looks are a great example of that
they're also stunning and they are great
inspiration if you want to do something
more fun and exciting with this palette
but if you're looking for something
that's everyday I definitely don't think
that this is it I mean I know a lot of
you would be like well tell there's a
pink in it but still I just wanted this
just be more wearable because there are
a lot of like more neutral shades or
things that you can kind of make
more neutral and I don't know it just
doesn't do it for me this palette does
not do it for me it's not that I don't
recommend it I just think you should
know all the facts going into it see if
these colors are things you'd like
swatch our test oh look at them see
what's in your collection do you have
things similar because I know this is
it's just a lot of money I think that's
the biggest thing if if color pop came
out with a palette that was very similar
to this it would be worth it to me
because it's $16 even if even if I had
the same problems that I'm having with
this palette with that it would be worth
it because it's the price difference
that's what gets me with this palette is
it's just so frickin expensive and I
don't understand why I had someone
asking a comment do I wish that I got
the sunset palette over this one and
honestly I don't know maybe I would use
that palette slightly more because it
does have some more of those like really
you know fun warm colors I feel like
that are a little bit more trendy maybe
a little bit easier to wear but I think
between the two of them it's just not my
style I do tend to prefer shadows that
are a bit more buildable and you can
kind of control a little bit easier so
the amount of pigmentation that this
palette offers especially when it comes
to mattes is not something that's a
positive for me personally I know a lot
of people love just like pigmented
shadows but when I comes to mattes I
like something that I can like build up
and work with I can control and can just
kind of like slowly build to what I want
I did use these on clients and I did
like the looks that I created again I
use the color Magnolia that was
SuperDuper pretty I also used some of
these you know and this shade here which
is called Layla and that was like a
really pretty smoky eye I will leave
those pictures up on the screen as well
they were just really simple I just find
basically like this is a companion
palette I use like one or two shades and
then I have to bring in my own eye
shadows to kind of round out the look
finish up the love and so to me I'm like
why just spend out here in $20 for like
a lid shade you know what I mean that's
just not worth it for me and yeah I
think that's kind of it for my review I
hope I'm not missing anything
this isn't a glowing review because
personally I am someone who likes to get
a good value for my money so me
personally I am more into affordable
makeup that works really well like that
is what I enjoy finding that's what I
like spending my money on I would rather
spend the same amount of money that I
spent on this on a bunch of colour-pop
or jus vias place or equivalent quality
shadows to me that's more fun more
exciting I would enjoy that more than
having all my money locked into this one
piece maybe if you were picking your own
shadows that might be a better deal for
you because you can pick the ones that
you want but when it comes to this
prepackaged one like the colors look so
beautiful but when it comes down to
using them I just I don't reach for this
as much as I really wish I I would
naturally for the price I paid for it I
think you guys get that so I'm gonna
move on to live swatches of this palette
and then we will get into the demo of
the look the stay tuned for that let me
know down below though if this is
something you've picked up what your
thoughts are if you like this palette if
you want to get it if you don't I just
want to know overall what your guys's
opinions are on Natasha de Nonna
a little bit at the end here something
that has been hard for me is that I you
know I have looked on the website and
one of the things that she prides
herself in is having she wants to create
makeup for the everyday woman and it's
it's hard for me because when I look at
the looks that she has on her Instagram
none of those are the everyday women to
me when I look at this palette the
colors in here are very editorial the
way she uses them and demonstrates them
as very editorial should put like
shimmers in the crease and then on top
of that the price point is very
expensive and luxury and I feel like
none of that is the everyday woman like
nothing about that is the everyday woman
so I feel like her branding to me is
kind of like it's it's trying to be both
and it just can't be so anyway those are
my thoughts and let's just get into
swatches
hi guys let's get started on the demo
portion I have already primed my eyelids
but I'm gonna go in with a cream shadow
just to set the base because there isn't
a cream shadow in the palette so this is
just gonna help my shadows blend easier
and I definitely want that now something
that I for sure mentioned at the
beginning of this video is the fact that
the mattes
in the palette are just a little bit too
dark for me this one here per se as well
as I believe that's nude mauve they're
just a little bit too dark they don't
look like they would be but once you
start blending them they are so I'm
gonna go in again with a different
shadow this is just my Physicians
Formula quad and I'm gonna be working
with this shadow and just starting a
transition and then we'll go into those
other mounds if you are someone who has
a darker complexion you definitely
wouldn't need a lighter shade now that I
have that on I'm gonna go in with the
color nude mob and I'm going to be
placing that into my crease and mostly
focus it on the outer portion of my eye
we're just deepening up what we have
going on for this look we're keeping it
very simple I just wanted something
glowy and nice on my skin so I want to
keep the eyes like fun and the most
focus of everything but still pretty
neutral I'm going in with this shade
here which is helio I'm actually just
gonna go in with my finger it's just so
much easier guys I try to be proper with
the brushes but the finger always can
just pack the shadow on in so much less
time I'm also gonna pop a little bit as
you know just like on the center of the
lid just over top just to give it a
little bit of a brightness I'm actually
doing it over the whole lid now to
deepen up the outer corner I'm gonna go
in with this here this is nude vino OOP
you can't see it and we're just keeping
that on the outer portion of the eye
every time I use this color it's always
so interesting to me because it looks
like it's gonna be so much warmer than
it really translates on me and then to
add in a little bit more interest I'm
gonna go in with Amara I believe
and I'm going to just kind of Pat that
over where we just put nude vino like
it's always so surprising to me how dark
these looks get like this look is really
dark to me for it every day this is
definitely way darker than I usually
would go to make sure my edges are
blended I'm going back in with my e-40
which we used at the beginning and just
blending everything out and then just to
pack on any more brightness I'm gonna go
back in with the shade Helia and as you
know and that's it for the eyes at the
moment let's move on to face I'm gonna
zoom us out I really didn't have much
fallout which is amazing so I'm gonna go
in with my Cokie primer this is the
smooth glow and I actually have really
been enjoying this it doesn't give you
an insane glow it does make you a little
bit more glowy but it has almost a tacky
feel which is not something I'm into at
all usually but this one just like looks
good it feels really nice on the skin
too so I'm surprised I'm actually liking
it because I my first impressions were
not the best but the more I use it the
more I like it like I mentioned I'm
going for just kind of like a symbolic
today I don't want anything too heavy I
just want to feel pretty and natural and
not overdone so for foundation today I'm
gonna be going in with the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD mine is in the shade 117
or 225 Y 225 I believe and then I'm
gonna mix that with the covergirl clean
my beauty cream in fair this one is just
a little bit too dark on me like it does
oxidize a tiny bit and I'm losing my tan
quite fast and it's a little bit pink
and this is yellow I don't know together
they just work and I always just mix
them on the back of my hand and then I
just dot what I had on my finger when I
mixed it and then you guys know I just
have been loving a brush lately which is
so weird but I'm just going to use a
brush and buff that in I might not even
use everything I have on my hand again I
don't want anything too too intense for
concealer today I am using the Estee
Lauder Double Wear this is in the shade
C one light and I'm still trying to
figure out how I feel about this
I'm still kind of trying to figure out
this concealer honestly like part of me
likes it part of me doesn't I don't know
I'm just like on the fence about it
still so um yeah I'm still testing it
out and I love applying my concealers
with a Beauty Blender it just looks the
best under my eyes I'm gonna be using
two different powders today one is just
a clear translucent for underneath my
eyes and kinda in my t-zone I really
like using lightweight powders for those
areas I find that they're able to set
the area without looking cakey I'm
really sorry if you can hear the dog
outside but for the rest of my face I'm
going in with this Clarins powder this
is the everlasting compact long-wearing
in comfort foundation in 103 ivory I
have not used this yet so I am excited
to try it out it might be a little light
so we'll just see I'm just gonna kind of
buff that in to the rest of my face I'm
just kind of going lightly because I
don't need a ton of coverage it's a very
silky powder feels nice really fast
before you move further I'm going to go
in and kind of just like clean up this
edge um under the brow bone with a cream
powder because it's looking a little I
don't know muddy or something compared
to the other side so I just want to have
that a bit more defined so it matches
the other side all right I think that's
a least a little better for bronzer
today I'm using the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess this is in light one I've really
actually been enjoying this it's a
pretty it's not super opaque which is
why it works it has a Sheerness to it
which I really like it makes it
buildable I feel like I can really
control it and I like the tone of it too
it's a little bit more like red Brown
then some of my other bronzers but I do
like it a lot for blush today I'm using
a favorite this is benefits rocket or
for highlighter and going in with the
essence pure nude highlighter I haven't
used this a ton of my channel but I do
really like it it gives just such a nice
more natural glow although I think that
it still kind of intense like I know
people try to act like this is like
nothing it's a glow for babies but I
think that it still has quite a bit of
shine to it it just isn't
metallic we're now ready to move back to
the eyes I'm going to be using two
different liners today I'm gonna type
mine and put a little bit of Max Costa
reach on the lower lash line and then
I'm going to go in just with the nude
side of this pencil on my waterline I
feel like for the lower lash line the
only thing that's gonna look like really
good and I think would compliment that
liner well is going in with a mix of
Amara and nude vino and yeah this look
is a lot darker than I was intending but
I feel like that's what happens with
this palette unless I use like two
shades it's gonna turn out kind of dark
a for the inner corner I'm gonna go in
with as you know and just pack that on
the inner portion of the eye to bring
some light and I'm also gonna bring the
tiniest bit of this under the tallest
arch of the brow bone and last for eyes
I'm going in with a new mascara to me
this is the number seven lash impact
ultra instant false lash Volume Mascara
I love the packaging it's super pretty
and sparkly but the sparkles are
actually like contained in the packaging
so you're not gonna like get them on
your hands and then get them on your
face the brush looks promising
potentially so we're just gonna try it
out so those would be eyes I don't know
how I feel about the mascara I kind of
like it I kind of don't so it'll
definitely take time a couple more uses
for me to really know what I think also
I want to know how it wears for lech let
me tell you about that this is the Fenty
beauty gloss balm and I am just doing
that today I've had some pretty intense
lips in the last couple videos which
have been so pretty and so fun good if
I'm being an honest this is where I live
I love simple stuff and that's
everything for the video guys thank you
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this look I hope you enjoyed the review
and that it actually helped you decide
if this is a palette that you want to
actually splurge on or not and I will
see you guys in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
