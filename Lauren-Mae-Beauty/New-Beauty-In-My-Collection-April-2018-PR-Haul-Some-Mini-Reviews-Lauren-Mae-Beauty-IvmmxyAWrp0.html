Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be showing you guys
some of the new products in my beauty
collection most of this stuff is PR I do
have a few items that I bought myself
that I'm gonna be just tacking on
because I don't want to have like a ton
of haul videos this is going to be
mostly things that were sent to me so
just a disclaimer at the front so you
guys know what it's about it's in my
title that all being said I'm gonna be
showing you some of the new products in
my collection I did have a PR tube talk
so I'm gonna leave that link down below
in case you haven't seen it I haven't
posted it yet as a filming this but it
will be up by the time this video is up
so I'm gonna show you guys some of the
things that have been sent to me if I
have tried it out I'll give you like a
mini review and then with these videos I
am going to be coming back to you guys
like a month or two later however long
it takes me to test this stuff out to
let you guys know how I feel about it
if it worked for if it worked for me if
it didn't do I suggest it do I not yeah
so that'll be coming with it a little
bit later on that long intro being said
let's get into the products because it's
kind of a lot of stuff I'm gonna start
off with a package I was like the most
excited for like it was one of the ones
I was most excited for this one is from
sol de janeiro you guys know i freaking
love them so they sent out three
different products and the entire like
focus of this is the new Brazilian bod
buff body scrub I had this in my most
recent favorites I've really been
enjoying this it's been in my shower so
I'm just gonna like put it back in here
to like show you I guess for the
showmanship of it all I really do like
this this comes out yellow so this is
yellow and what is kind of nice about
this that I didn't think I would like is
that this is more like a cream with some
grit in it it's not like a sugar scrub
where it's mostly consisted of those
gritty particles I love the smell it's
their classic smell I also want to try
doing this on like dry skin because I
really feel like the grit power of this
is like amplified when there isn't water
at it if this is considered a mask as
well so you can like do it leave it on
and then go wash it off in the shower I
think that'd be a great way to use it
anyway I'm gonna have to keep this
shorter or this video is gonna be
forever long I really enjoy it you guys
can check out my favorites video if you
want to know more about it they also
sent it through one of the boom boom
creams so I have a full-size of that
that's a great body moisturizer it sinks
into the skin so fast I am NOT someone
who likes lotion I don't like feeling
greasy but that one's really nice and
again it has that really nice like I
feel like it's kind of like a tropical
scent but it's just it smells so so good
and that was super pumped that it came
with the shower cream because this is
something I was gonna repurchase for
Italy I really want to have like the
scent memory of this scent with the
summer in Italy so I was gonna bring
this with me when we went now I have it
so it's perfect I love that shower cream
it just smells nice again I really like
a scent experience in the shower I just
enjoy that and then overall I do like
the product itself I think it
moisturizes but again nothing like
greasy or anything it's not like crazy
moisturizing it just feels nice on the
skin so for me that was just like such a
cool moment because it's a brand that
I've just felt such a connection to from
the beginning and then for them to reach
out it felt so awesome the next brand is
very similar this is Moroccan oil and
again I love this brand this is a brand
I've used for forever because my mom's a
hairdresser so she's been using their
products for such a long time and I've
been using the Moroccan oil for years
and years and years so there are four
different products in the box they sent
it over in my favorite the dry shampoo
this is in the light tones I've gone
through probably like three of these I
freaking love the smell of Moroccan oil
as well again I'm a scent personal but
on top of that this dry shampoo just
works so well this is my favorite luxury
dry shampoo I think it's worth the price
I can't always spend the money but when
I do have it or I can get it on a good
deal I highly suggest it and I buy it I
love it so good
the package also came with a shampoo and
conditioner this is from the hydration
range so I'm a little bit nervous this
might be a little bit heavy on my hair I
absolutely love the volumizing shampoo
and conditioner that's probably my
favorite shampoo and conditioner that
I've ever tried but I'm willing to give
this a go see how it works on my hair
but I have a feeling it might be a
little bit too heavy so we'll see I'll
keep you guys updated if this one works
well or not and it'll be interesting to
see how it compares to the volume I have
very fine thin hair though so I don't
know we'll see how it goes that might be
one I have to pass on to my mom and then
the last item in there was the Moroccan
oil treatment which this is actually the
light version I have the original
version right here the light
version is the same thing it's not like
less heavy it's just not an amber color
so I'm just keeping this in the box
until I can get to it I like to try to
keep things on open as long as possible
or until I'm ready to use it that way
I'm not like wasting product or you know
watching it I can pass it on when it's
still like a fresh brand new product so
I am going to just be keeping this in
the box until I'm ready to use it or
pass it on or whatever I'm doing with it
number seven also cites some products
through I did get to pick out the four
products that I wanted so I chose the
protect and perfect intense advanced
night cream as well as the day cream in
the same line so I've been using the
night cream probably for a good week and
a half at least and I do enjoy it it's
really nice it's different than what I
have been using which is the first aid
beauty ultra Repair night cream or just
ultra Repair Cream I don't know the one
on the huge tub that is something I've
been using for a while but this is
really nice
definitely a totally different texture
it feels more just rich on the skin so I
have been enjoying that but I'm not like
a super skincare person in the sense of
like telling you guys why it's working
in ingredients and stuff so I just tried
to hydrate and do what I think will work
and then can tell you guys my opinions
based off of that knowledge the day
cream I've only tried once so I don't
really have an opinion on that yet I
picked out a serum this is the early
defense of glow activating serum and I
actually have already used this up I
just finished this last night I got this
one sent to me from octa Lee and then I
decided to pick this one again because I
actually did enjoy this product it's not
like my favorite serum ever but I think
it's nice it gives a little bit of
hydration but nothing too much I thought
this might be a little bit more silicone
II like the other serum I've tried from
number seven but this one isn't quite as
much I don't know this one I definitely
liked a lot better so I have another one
to go through of that and last they sent
over some eye masks I have used these
once they worked really nicely I've
mentioned this before but for me I masks
mostly or just for like deep puffing and
like a little bit of a pampering moment
a little bit of moisture going into the
under eye but I don't really notice any
like brightening or tightening I've
never noticed with anything but these
ones are nice I do enjoy them so those
have been some
fun products that I've been trying out
let's talk about some makeup you guys
have probably known this already let me
try to grab this box I've talked about
it but I did get sent to the covergirl
box which is insane to me I mean if you
guys don't know I'm super appreciative
and blown away by the fact that brands
reach out it's like so insane it's
really insane so I did get that crazy
package this is the most extravagant PR
package I've ever received it had the
entire range of the spring 2018
collection in here so yeah I've taken
all the products out of here so I can't
wait to like get rid of this box it's
been like around my house hanging out
for a long time so there are just tons
of products I've been testing these out
for a while I will have a testing
testing one two three coming to you guys
I've been probably testing these out for
a good at least two and a half weeks now
so that will be coming once I get back
from Oregon and can like you know
reassess what's going on with my life I
will get you guys the final reviews on
these and get that video uploaded for
you I also have some lip swatches so I
will leave those videos linked down
below if you want to know the colors
because there were three different like
lip collections or lines that came in
this package
I did do swatches on them and kind of
like mini reviews so I'll leave that if
you want to check it out oh I realized
that I'm not even like I just realized
my ankle was like totally messed up guys
sorry if you if you saw my curtain
anyway moving on this is probably the pr
package i've had the longest so i have
tested this out i was reached out to by
super goop or at least like a PR company
that represents them and they sent out
one of their new products it is the
invisible setting powder SPF 45 this is
one of those products that comes with
the brush now i've been using the
translucent shade but it does come in
three other shades for darker skin tones
I believe that these do have like a
sheer coverage still though so I love
that they included something because we
all kind of know that translucent is not
translucent but those ones I have not
tested out I'm keeping them pristine for
my other friends so this is like how it
works it has like a brush on it okay so
I love the powder
like the axle powder but I find that the
actual contraption itself doesn't quite
work when I try to like put up the thing
it removes the whole magnet situation so
I just don't think the packaging works
on this I love the powder though so I'm
thinking about deep potting it because
it's it's nice it's really quite thin on
the skin it just has a nice texture on
the skin or lack of texture on the skin
so I really do like this but I don't
think it's practical so I don't like
suggest it but yeah it's kind of like
one of those Oh why and I really wanted
it to work too because it is SPF it's
like an easy way to reapply SPF
throughout the day that isn't going to
ruin your makeup and I thought it'd be
nice for Italy but the actual travel
portion and like the easy part of this
doesn't work next for makeup model zone
actually reached out to me which was
kind of cool this was a brand that I've
never tried before and they asked if
there was anything I was interested in
so I saw that they have some cream
eyeshadows you guys know I love the
cream eyeshadows so I was like I would
love to try those out and I didn't know
they were going to send them to me
because they didn't really respond back
but I got a package in the mail so
that's really awesome I think I might do
a whole like review video based off of
all the different cream shadows I might
do some looks with these I'm wearing one
of the shades on my eyes today which is
copper but this is not copper I feel
like this turned kind of like almost
like a deep green and this is so
pigmented it's so freakin pigmented I
thought this is going to be more of like
a glitter topper ish type of situation
kind of like the color pop ones or the
coverfx one that I got in my boxycharm
this one here is the one that's the most
metallic they're really cool so I'm
excited I really haven't test them out
though so I don't know if they're good
or worth it but I will try to get some
videos up using these or you know test
amount and let you guys know what I
think but I love that they're drugstore
you know super cool I've just been
really into those liquid eyeshadows I do
have a few products that I got sent
through octoly I'll start with the
makeup first I have a Kiko mascara this
is a part of the free soul collection I
did a whole review on that so I'm going
to leave that link down below but I've
talked about how I really wanted to try
out the red
mascara or like the burgundy mascara and
so this became available and I was like
I'm gonna try that out so I have it
underneath my lashes today I've used it
one other time it's pretty dark so it's
like a very subtle pop of Burgundy but I
definitely think it adds that something
different like you can tell it's
different but you just don't quite know
how until someone points it out it also
is like your crying blood Widow take it
off so just be warned about that and
stuff like interesting it feels like
you're like bleeding from your eyes a
little bit when you're removing your
makeup but uh I don't know it's kind of
a cool thing right anyway the other
makeup product that I got from octoly is
from Oprah and this is the blush in
Bellini this is something that I think
it came out last year around summer time
and I love a peach blush those are like
the ones I kind of go to that and like a
nude blush so I thought this would be
right up my alley and I really like it
I'm wearing it today if you've seen some
other videos I have been using this
another one so you might have seen this
on my channel already but I just wanted
to show it here in case you haven't seen
those it's beautiful I really like it
this is pretty expensive though but I do
like the upgraded packaging I think
that's a plus I really hope that they
start making all their stuff in this
nicer packaging and the last thing from
octoly is from patch ology it's the
daily gel moisturizer this is so cute
first off I really do like the packaging
I know that doesn't really mean much but
it's just really cute and tiny but it
still has 1.7 fluid ounces a product
which is a very average for a jar
container this reminds me of it's kind
of like the aqua bomb gel one though
it's very very thin and it moisturizes
really well it feels like really great
but it's not like goopy you don't feel
greasy at all so if you have oily skin I
think this would work well for you I
haven't tried at a time but that's
definitely more where I feel like this
moisturizer would be targeted to our
people who have oily skin are already
producing a lot of oil and just need
hydration you still need hydration but
this one isn't gonna feel heavy on the
skin and I don't think it's gonna make
you greasy so I'm excited to try that
one out I think I only have one more
product that was sent to me and then the
rest I actually bought so we'll get into
that later it's funny because I feel
like people usually do the opposite but
yeah I'm gonna show you the stuff
at the end so I have an item here from
pur Lisse I was lucky enough to be
invited to go to an event actually which
is so crazy I mentioned it in another
video so I don't know if that one at
first or not because I'm really trying
to make sure I have videos while I'm
gone in Oregon but at the time I'm
filming this I have gone to the event
and that all happened and it was really
fun and I was just being super dramatic
and I was just nervous because hello I
have anxiety but it was really fun it
was called beauties and bikes and it was
a spin class and girl like we all know
I'm not like the skinny mini like that's
not me and I love myself but that was
like so tough I've Jenna spin class one
other time in my life and it was really
tough and this time was no different but
it was great you know you guys know I'm
on like my weight-loss journey at the
moment so it was kind of nice to be
doing two things that I'm really
focusing on beauty obviously but then I
am focusing on my health so it kicked my
ass I am very sore I my muscles are
currently crying and recovering but I
felt good like you know was one of those
things like I'm proud of myself for like
finishing that class out and whoo yeah
it was a lot so with that afterwards we
got like some treats and then pur Lisse
debuted a new product this is their
coconut oil and coffee sugar body scrub
I'm super excited to try this out I
already mentioned the Brazilian pod buff
from Sol de Janeiro and this is in very
similar packaging I love that this is in
a squeeze tube so much that is very
exciting to me it's just so much easier
in the shower
I know Kaylee would love this because of
the packaging alone so yeah feel like
I've been mentioning Kaylee a lot in my
videos but I know that she would
probably love this so I can't wait to
try it out see how it compares to the
other ones this is a sugar scrub so I
expect it to be really gritty and a lot
different than the sol de janeiro one
but we shall see I know this product is
pretty pricey I went on the website
today and it's like 36 dollars so it has
a lot to live up to for it being that
high of a price point that's just that's
pretty high pretty high but I'm very
grateful and excited to try it out now
let's get into the items that I've
purchased with my own money I bought all
the stuff with my own money really quick
I wanted to mention boxycharm I'm just
updating guys letting you know that
probably the video after this or like a
couple videos after this will be my
unboxing and Tryon as well as an a recap
on my boxy charms of the past so that'll
be coming up I'm gonna do that after I
get back from organ I'm very tempted to
bust into the box now and like maybe
bring some things with me but I'm not
gonna do it because I do want to like
unbox it on camera and use it all there
so I'll just have to wait I'll have to
wait I did order some candles off of
sent Birds website I have a whole review
video on these I'll leave that link down
below I really enjoyed the candle that I
had and so I repurchase it the original
one they had sent out to me and then I
purchased this so this is like an actual
like the PR made me buy it type of thing
this is Siberian fir and cedar wood it
smells so good I've talked about it it
smells like The Times Fraser Fir candle
which is so good I know that a lot of
people would be like that's just like a
holiday scent but I love it any time of
year which I'm probably gonna try to
save it more for the holidays which I
know we're just getting into summer so
like what but I love it I just it was on
a great deal they were two for 25 I
think and then it was like three dollars
shipping so I got both of them for 28
when they're normally $22 a piece
and I didn't have to do the subscription
which is something I wanted to avoid
because I don't want these sent to me
monthly I just wanted to buy what I
wanted at the moment and then the other
scent that I was interested in is the
Earl Grey and blackberry and this is
really nice it's very sweet but you can
smell that Earl Grey tea for sure I
really enjoy it I'll see how it burns
though yeah I'm excited to try this one
out and then the last bit of stuff here
is just an order I made off of Sephora's
website so I did pick up this set this
is the sex on the peach set from Too
Faced and the reason I wanted to try
this out was because of the loose powder
I I really enjoy oh my gosh I just
dropped it all I really enjoy loose
powders and from my makeup math video I
knew that this was a lot of product in
here and the whole set was I think 45 or
$49 this normally retails for like 30
something and that's been out of stock
for forever so since the scent came out
and it was a good value getting other
products in it and I knew that this
powder alone is just a lot of product
and so it was a great value price per
gram I was like I'm gonna go for it I
tried this out today I do really like it
if
really nice it's super thin the
packaging is kind of cool
it has like a little a sifter but then
it has like a I don't know like a plug
or something like a stopper but it's
kind of hard to like okay but now I want
product out but you can't like close it
and shake it because those little
Stoppers fill up the hole so they don't
go everywhere so that's been like
difficult we'll see if I get like a I
don't know like a way to use it a little
bit better as I use it longer but so far
so good but it's been one day so the you
know what does that mean the set comes
with three other products in it so it
has two more of the peach items it has a
mini of the mattifying setting spray you
guys know I've been loving the freaking
coconut one of the three in one hangover
replenishing primer in setting spray I
know the whole freaking title because
I've typed it out and said it so many
times in the last like month anyway I've
been wanting to try this out so I'm
excited to have a mini version of it
just in case I don't like it because I
feel like I've heard some people say
they don't like it and then it did come
with a mini of the primer this is the
primed and PG cooling matte skin
perfecting primer
I have a very baby baby baby sample of
this and I haven't really tried that out
a bunch but I was like okay this is a
nice size it has a pump and everything
so I thought that was great and then it
also comes with a mascara and now from
the pictures I thought this was a mini
so when I pulled it out I was like holy
crap this is the full size better than
sex mascara so I'm excited to try that
out again I believe I've gone through a
many of it but I have never used the
full size I know a lot of people like
the mini better I know a lot of people
say this flakes a lot of people love it
so I am saving this because I'm going
through two at the moment and I just
don't need to open another one but I
can't wait to bust this open and kind of
like see how it is because I haven't
used it in forever and I just felt like
the full size of this in the full-size
powder really make this a great set
along with the fact that you you're
getting some other decent travel size
items in here too so if that was
something you were wanting I would try
this out maybe for the sale get a
discount on it or get it early because
it probably is going to sell out but I
this is a really nice kit the other
full-size item that I bought which I
just tried to destroy right now by
dropping it but luckily we're all good
this is a new NARS highlighter and this
is in the shade Fort de France I picked
this up because Mariah Leonard talked
about it and I really wanted to try it
out so I'm wearing it today
I had a subscriber be like you should
check it out so it's like a peachy color
it's not too dark for my skin but it's
not super like highlighting either but I
really think it'll work the best for me
in the summertime like it still works
today but I think that it'll really
really pop on me when I'm just the
tiniest bit tanner so I am excited to
bring this to Italy with me it was kind
of fun to get something different this
has a nice Sheen to it with no sparkle
it's one of those like wet-looking
highlighters so something a little bit
different for my collection and I am
excited to give it a go and try it out
some more and I thought I might as well
show you the minis that I got so I did
get a many of the cover effects
power-play foundation this is in the
shade 20 I believe 20 n hopefully
that'll work I think this might actually
work for me so I'm excited to try that
out I love getting minis of the
foundations because I've really been
wanting to explore out and try different
things but I don't know it's been tough
it's been tough I don't know what I like
I just know that I like a couple things
but I'm running out of those and then I
just have other things in my collection
I feel like my foundation routine is
just kind of like changing every like
week and a half and then this was part
of just like the three samples you can
pick but this is the buxom white Russian
it's a little baby lip gloss I love the
size of this it's like perfect for me
because it's like not only a mini but
like a mini mini and we all know I don't
go through lip products very often so
it's the perfect amount of product for
me honestly
alright so that's everything I know it
was a lot I cannot wait to like put all
this stuff away and get rid of all the
clutter in the boxes and all this other
crap that I've been holding on to I just
want to say thank you to you guys for
all of your support I know without you I
would never be given all this stuff and
I really do appreciate it I want to have
that transparency on my channel letting
you guys know what I get I'm not trying
to hide anything from you I'm always
here to try to give you just my best
opinion I possibly can and yeah I just
want to say I appreciate your support
and thank you so much
with that if you have anything from here

more in-depth things on or you are more
interested in let me know in the
comments so I can try to form my content
