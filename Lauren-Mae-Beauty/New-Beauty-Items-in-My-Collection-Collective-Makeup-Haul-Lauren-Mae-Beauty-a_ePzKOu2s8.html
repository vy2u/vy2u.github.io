that's learn thank you so much for
watching today we're gonna be doing a
haul video now this is a lot of stuff so
definitely like you might want to watch
it in two parts I just wanted to make
one big haul video though I didn't want
to like split it up myself so yeah just
a warning up front I honestly don't
think I've got any of this stuff during
Black Friday the only thing I think I
purchased with a Black Friday discount
was some health stuff which actually
isn't here yet that won't be here until
like the 7th of December so I will
probably do either a separate haul video
or some type of separate video on that
but um yeah I wanted to show you guys
this stuff the new stuff in my
collection so that you guys can know
what's coming in and you guys can tell
me what you want reviews on some of this
stuff is PR and was given to me for free
some of it I purchased with gift cards
some of it I purchase with my own money
so it's kind of a lot of everything I
think that's it of course let me know
what you guys want to see reviews on or
more videos on down below I will also be
doing an update to this haul in the
future so look forward to that and
without wasting any more time let's get
into the products I picked up I'm gonna
start off with some Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
stuff I picked up some hand soaps
because I was running out of hand soaps
and I got an email or something saying
that hand soaps for only two dollars and
fifty cents every single hand soap any
hands up in the entire store and I was
like oh that's a pretty good deal and it
was right before we were heading out to
Arizona for Thanksgiving and then on top
of that I had a 10 off a 30 dollar
purchase coupon that was valid at that
time too so I called my mom and was like
hey do you want to split like $30 worth
of or 20 I guess dollars worth of hand
soaps with me and she said yes so that
was the reason I went in I thought that
was like such an amazing deal and so I
think I got all of these for a dollar 70
each or so which I was really happy
about something I wanted to keep in mind
as I was shopping was I didn't want to
get a bunch of only like winter cents
because I find that what I'll do is I'll
stock up on winter scents and then I
feel like oh well I want summer scents
now I don't want to like smell like a
wreath or you know cinnamon cloves
instead I want like something beachy and
so then that'll make me go buy stuff so
I tried to make these more scent neutral
or maybe only get a couple of winter
scents and then try to pick
some summer one so I think I did a good
job I have seven different hand soaps
here to show you guys and I believe I
spent in total $24 with tax and me and
my mom split that so I think that's
pretty good
the first up here this is bergamont
waters from Bath and Body Works this is
something a little bit different for
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works scents because this
one is a little bit more subtle I really
do enjoy it so I'm really happy about
that one this next one here is in the
scent
iced blue sage so this one is a little
bit more for winter it's actually part
of their exfoliating range so that was
exciting this was also part of the deal
which I thought was great I picked up
two of the honey scent range this is the
nourishing hand soap Sunkist citrus and
honey and then this one is the winter
cranberry I thought these were both
really nice I mean it's crazy because
I'm thinking right now usually they do a
deal for like six for 24 and then maybe
you can use a coupon or like 20% off but
the fact that I've got I think like 13
for 24 is so good again all of the soap
so even this one which is like one of
the more expensive ones this is 850
originally which I know no one pays for
but this was also 250 this is a lavender
birch and it smells really really good
the packaging is cute but also kind of
cheap but it smells so so good I really
like that one and then these are my last
two I got some of the foaming ones this
is the Honolulu Sun gentle foaming so
that's great for summer and then this
was the only other like winter one I got
which is fresh
balsam so I am excited for that I love
this scent in the candle so to me those
are really exciting I love that I'm
excited to use them it was fun to get
them on such a great deal but they're
also something I know I go through I
guess I'll get into the real stuff now I
know I was stalling a little bit with
the soaps I'm gonna get into the BH
Cosmetics order that I place now you've
already seen this if you've seen my get
ready with me which is how I did that I
love today so if you want to check that
out I will leave it linked down below I
use this to create this look but this is
the zodiac palette I had this in my
makeup wishlist and I've never tried
anything from BH and I decided to just
go for it I think they were having 25%
off the site when I ordered this stuff
so I thought that was pretty good
although I know that they do different
deals and they also have
stuff coming up for Black Friday and
whatnot so you can always get them on
some type of deal anyway this was a
palette that I really wanted to pick up
I really like that there are a ton of
colors in here the outer ring of shadows
are all metallics and then the inner
ring are matte and then in here is a
highlighter which I use as an eyeshadow
on the inner corner today I've used this
twice so I don't have like a cool review
but so far I really have been enjoying
it I think that the metallics on the
outside are really nice especially for
the price I think I ended up paying like
16 dollars for this palette which I am
really like happy with the quality with
everything that I've gotten from this
palette for that price uh yeah I want to
explore this more I love all the
different colors that are in here I'm
very very happy so far with this
purchase and it makes me definitely want
to try some more BH Cosmetics out soon
and then while I was placing that order
I think I wanted to get free shipping
but free shipping didn't like I didn't
have to get very high so I decided to
pick up another item that I was wanting
for a long time this is the black light
highlighting six color palette from BH
this is one of those duochrome
highlighter palettes I had seen so many
pictures of this online when it first
launched and that is what made me want
to get it it just looks so pretty
today is the first day that I'm wearing
it I use it in my get ready with me and
I'm using a mix of the color strobe here
which is like a really metallic pearl
white and this is illusion which is pink
but it has like a really strong like
purple violet undertone and I'm not sure
how I feel about this we will see how it
goes I think this is like a pretty
palette they're definitely pigmented but
I need to work with them a little bit
more they definitely show up with the
smallest amount of pigment those are
kind of the only thoughts I can give on
this palette at the moment since I've
only used it once but I will definitely
keep you guys updated whether it's in
the hall in retrospect that will come a
little bit later or if I do a separate
review on just the zodiac palette in
this next I wanted to share some things
that amazing cosmetics actually sent
over I was not expecting this package
I've gotten one concealer from them
before and so that's how they have an
address but I was not expecting them to
send me anything they didn't let me know
they were sending it so that was kind of
cool but what these products are this is
the amazing cosmetics illuminate primer
and highlighter this is something that
I'm wearing today I have enjoyed it I
enjoyed it today we'll see how oily I
get how it wears throughout the day I
will come back and give you guys a
review on that and then the other
product that they sent through is the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
illuminate and I was excited to try this
because I am wanting to try a few more
concealers something that I find with
amazing cosmetics like face products at
least the two that I've tried is that
they definitely are pretty thick they
give you some coverage but like this is
a thick concealer and I find for me that
I like something that is a bit more
moisturizing a thinner texture when it
comes to concealers I don't want
anything that's gonna add too much
texture to the skin this blend it out
fine I've only used it once but I'm
probably only gonna use it a couple more
times I kind of have some thoughts on it
it blended out fine under the eye but
because of the illuminate on it I
thought it would be more moisturizing or
just more dewy but for them illuminate
on this product means Sparkle isn't it
so I put this under the eye I blended it
out with my Beauty Blender and literally
it looked like I had fallout from like
glitter eye shadow under my eyes like
that's because that is the illuminate
aspect of this concealer so I did not
enjoy that it just it has glitter in it
and I didn't see the glitter actually I
didn't see the glitter until I had put
the powder on it was like I put some
powder on brush it away and then glitter
appeared it was crazy it's like those um
you know glitter lipsticks where it's
like you touch it and move it and then
the glitter comes out that's kind of how
this was so I'm going to try it a few
more times but first impressions on this
I do not suggest it I will come back
with more of a review later a few more
makeup items that were sent to me these
are both from number 7 Beauty this first
one here is the city light tinted
moisturizer I have it in the shade fair
I'm wearing it today and
again I have a lot of first impressions
on these because I was using a lot of
these products and might get ready with
me today but this is a very sheer tinted
moisturizer so that's something you want
you would like it I do like the
consistency in the texture but for
coverage it's definitely a tinted
moisturizer like in the most shear
capacity and then this is a bronzer from
them in the shade golden sand I do
really like this this is matte
I think it's pretty light it's a little
bit warm but I kind of like that in a
bronzer it's not you know meant to be
necessarily a contour I'm wearing it
again today I've only used it a couple
of times so I definitely want to give
this more of a go but so far it's it's
not my favorite but it's definitely not
bad right before we headed out to
Arizona for Thanksgiving I placed a
color pop order so when we got home I
had these things waiting at the door and
I was so excited so the first thing here
this is a concealer from them this is
the no filter concealer in the shade a
fair neutral I don't know how I feel
about this I've only used it once but I
didn't love it I didn't hate it I didn't
think it had a lot of coverage but it's
not like moisturizing like I'm not sure
I definitely need to use this a little
bit more let you guys know I've heard
good I've heard bad so I am excited to
try this out more and see what my
thoughts are the product I've definitely
used the most out of that haul is this
color pop brow boss gel I have it on
today and I've used it probably four
times now this is very interesting they
were not lying when they said it was a
different type of formula it almost is
like a hair pomade or something like the
way that it is it's like it's just
definitely a different consistency I
will come back and let you guys know I'm
gonna use this a little bit more it's so
far it's not worth it like I would not
repurchase it at the moment or how many
times I've used it and what it's about
it's like I would try something else
before I repurchase that okay and then
the big thing from the color pop order
oh I picked up the all I see is magic
palette now color palette just things
like comet the eff down
they have been releasing so much stuff
and it's like I love it like a part of
me loves it but then a part of me is
just like it's not becoming a special to
me
feel like they're literally releasing a
new palette every single week and I
can't keep up I don't want to keep up I
don't feel like the colors are that much
different especially if you pull them
all out like even the kathleenlights
palette and like I don't know if I'm
gonna pick it up but this one I thought
was really pretty so this is what it
looks like it's in a bit of a different
format than their original like twelve
pan this one is a 15 pan palette I
believe it's limited edition for the
Christmas season it's back to that
really like matte packaging that gets
really dirty but it is so pretty you
guys this palette is beautiful I really
really like it I'm really happy I picked
it up I've only used it once but I
really enjoyed the look that I came up
with when I did that so I will
definitely be doing some tutorials with
this or get ready with me and a review
if you guys wanted they did raise the
price on this I believe I paid $20 for
this but I do really like it I'm excited
to use it
what else did I pick up my gosh guys
seriously it's crazy now when I was in
Arizona with my mom I did go into a
Sephora actually in store which is not
usually my thing one of her friends she
watches my video she's like a family
friend and she wanted to get one of the
foundations I had recommended but she
wanted me to shade match her so we went
met at the Sephora I like sat her down
have her like sitting in the makeover
area and I'm like doing all this gesture
anyway um while we were there I had some
gift cards finally go through and I was
really excited because I saw these in
the store and then I just went crazy
about all of them these are the Hooda
Beauty obsessions palettes now you guys
have known that I wanted to pick these
up so it's no surprise that I did but I
did just like go for it and pick up all
four of them so I will definitely have a
comprehensive review on these once I've
tested them out a little bit longer
these are permanent so you don't need to
worry about rushing out and getting them
and that's kind of nice I don't have to
like you know try to get my thoughts on
these like really really fast but anyway
I'll go through the colors this is the
smokey obsessions now this is one that I
didn't know if I'd want to pick up but
it's just so pretty I really liked the
colors in here I thought it was the most
neutral I did have a little bit of
cracking with this shadow
just the tiniest bit so that was a
little bit disappointing I do have some
thoughts on these pallets a few times I
have used them I think collectively I've
used them about four times and I've
reached from you know palette to palette
but I don't want to give you know any
thoughts to prematurely so I'm gonna
continue using these and I will let you
guys know as soon as I can
they are pretty tiny they're in
cardboard packaging they definitely
don't feel like anything too expensive
but like I had mentioned before I'm glad
she's come out with a more affordable
option for her shadows because I mean
you get so many color options in this
small little palette for a way better
price than $65 like her other ones this
is the mob obsessions which I know a lot
of people have issues with it being
called the mob obsessions when it's not
necessarily mob it's more like
cranberries and stuff but this one's
super beautiful I was always gonna pick
up the electric obsessions because I
love how bright and colorful this is I
love that it's a mix of mattes and
shimmers so I'm really happy with that
and then the last one here is the warm
Brown obsessions probably the most basic
out of all of them they are all matte
except for the middle shimmer shades as
much as I was planned out I knew I
wanted to buy these the fact that I got
all of them was a bit of an impulse
purchase but so far I am liking them and
I will come back and give you guys some
more thoughts on these as I test them
out more and have just you know a better
grasp on all my thoughts with all the
different shadows and how to apply them
and all of that how they wear throughout
the day and whatnot now that I'm looking
through this stuff I was mistaken I did
purchase a few things from the Sephora
site during Black Friday
Sephora doesn't offer like a percentage
off instead they do like discounted
bundles and different things like that
although I will say I've seen some of
those things still on the site now so
they must have not sold out or I don't
really know but I saw some things I
thought were a good deal and again I had
some gift cards so I'm really happy with
these purchases too because I didn't
just pick these up because they were on
sale I picked them up because they were
things that I had wanted and they happen
to be on sale so the first thing here
this is the ultra Repair Cream from
first aid Beauty this is a $42 value and
it was only $15 means they are using
this
fill in a jar kind of like this right
now I talked about some of like the
skincare I'm using currently in my
skincare reviews video I'll leave it
linked but I really like that but I've
wanted to try this for a long time I
like that there's no like scent it's
very like great for like dry skin and
Sam's skin is very dry so I thought that
was a really great price I knew this
would last us a really long time and I
hoped that we liked it so I thought that
was a good time to try out that product
the next thing is like this crazy fun
thing this is going in our props bucket
we have a props bucket at our house for
when Sam is and different things that
whatnot but um this is a fun little gift
thing from pin rose perfumes I talked
about them in one of my current wishlist
videos and I decided to pick up this set
because it was $15 and you got some fun
stuff inside of here inside this tube it
like opens up let me see if I can do it
inside of this tube but there come like
three little roller balls so that's kind
of like a fun little thing for the
holidays okay anyway I'm just like
obsessed with the way that looks it's so
pretty I mean there's nothing that
special about the packaging on these
it's just like three little roller balls
and glass but the three different scents
that come in it one is wild child one is
secret genius and then this last one
here is Little Dipper and I've been
wanting to try some sense from them I
thought this is like a fun way to try
something more than just a like a single
use thing or what not I've really not
had a lot of time to like even smell
these I'm pretty sure a little
difference my favorite one out of the
three yeah I really like this it's like
nice and clean and fresh which is
definitely something I enjoy but I'm
going to try these out and I'll let you
guys know what I think on the cents and
if you were interested in Penrose I'm
gonna leave a link to their like sampler
from their website it's kind of like a
single-use thing but you can try every
single one of their fragrances and I
think it's only like $11 so if you were
interested I'm just gonna leave that
link so you guys can check that out
because I thought that was like a nice
way I just haven't bit the bullet and
this was at Sephora which I get two-day
shipping on and had a gift card and all
of that so that's why I chose that but
you know
would you share that next is something
that I've been wanting for a really long
time and I just haven't bought this is
from milk makeup and it is their glitter
stick I think that's all I mean it
doesn't even say on here what it's
called but they came out with a glitter
stick for Gay Pride Month oh it was it
which is like June or July
cannot remember but they came out with
something for that or for their birthday
or something and I really wanted to get
it but it was limited edition and I
didn't want to pay the full price for it
but they came out with this mini now I
did not know it was gonna be this a mini
this costs $14 I wanted it because I
just wanted this glitter stick so bad
you guys know I love glitter and all
that crap and I just thought this was
like such a fun way I just wanted to try
it out so I'm really happy that they had
this at a more affordable price and yeah
it's a glitter stick guys like it
definitely works I think this would be
fun if you do a lot of like fun like
festival stuff I don't think you should
necessarily be buying makeup just for
festival stuff but I'm excited to have
this I think it's like a cool little
idea it's kind of expensive definitely
not for everyone but I'm glad I got it
in a reasonable size for a better price
than the full size so that was just
something fun I wanted to pick up the
last thing I paid for in that order this
is from Urban Decay and you guys know I
love the perversion mascara it's like my
all-time favorite mascara and they had
this set with the full-size mascara with
the full size 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
in perversion for $15 which I thought
was a great price they recently put the
perversion in the Sephora like oh wow
Thursday special deals for I think it
was $15 but I think you just got the
mascara so when I saw that this also
came with the eyeliner I thought I don't
think I'm gonna get a better deal on
this product honestly so so happy I
picked this up I've never had the full
size of a mascara I've just had many
many tubes of the small ones so we'll
see if it works the same as the you know
deluxe sized sample hopefully it does
cuz I seriously love it and I'm excited
to bust this out I need to like use up
some of my mascaras before I completely
open this but I'm excited to have it
waiting in the wings
the last thing for that order is
something that I got for free because I
hit vib is that what it is VI not Rouge
I'm like the next level up which i think
is like $400 for the year and this was a
byte Lipsett so it came with three
different products and then this really
nice like clear plastic pouch I'm
actually gonna use that either in my kit
or in my purse because I think it's
really nice I came with a mini lipstick
which is like whatever this is the color
sweet cream and it's a bit of a I don't
know I feel like a strange color like a
burnt strawberry color is what I would
call it so it came with that it also
came with a matching lip pencil but it's
like weird because this is like lighter
and brighter essentially than the actual
lipstick so I don't know how they're
gonna like work together and then the
thing that I'm most excited about in it
is this is the bite Beauty line and
define lip primer so I want to try that
out I mean I would never purchase this
product but since I have it I might as
well try it right so yeah those came for
free I thought that was kind of nice
wish they were different colors inside
or all in like this pen form for me
personally but I can't really complain
about free products can i I only have a
few more things to show you guys this is
the last thing that was sent to me but
this came from the brand let me get it
out of here I've been playing around
with it but to keep it all together I've
just been like putting it back in the
packaging this is from Sylvain Delacorte
I believe she makes like she's made
fragrances for a lot of like really big
beauty brands and she's finally
branching out on her own and creating
her own line of fragrance so how she's
doing it is this is the musk collection
so it's five different takes on musk and
this is just the sampler pack and the
reason I said yes to this package is
because you can purchase this sampler
pack yourself for five dollars I thought
that was such a great price and you guys
know I've been trying to weed out a lot
of my perfumes in my collection I've
gone through I don't know like six
perfumes this year and I'm so excited to
just bring in good perfumes and more
boutique fragrances things that are
unique to me things that I just
absolutely love so I thought it'd be fun
to try out some perfumes musk is not
necessarily my
like signature scent or something that I
look for in a perfume but I thought it
would be cool to try out and I know a
lot of people like musts or like
patchouli or more like amber I don't
wanna say heavier sense but those types
of scents anyway so you have the five
different things that come here and then
what was cool is that it came with each
of these little like perfume things you
can spray on it with the name of each
perfume on it so you could spray them
and smell them and know which perfume is
on which thing I just really liked the
entire like package of this and then I
loved the price I love that you guys
could try this out for such an
affordable price it's a price that I
would actually pay to try out samples
like this so yeah I will leave a link
obviously for that down below it's not
like affiliate I don't get any money for
it or anything like that but I thought
that this was kind of cool and if you
want to try it out you guys can we are
onto the last bit of stuff here these
are all things that I purchased myself
for my makeup kit so I went to friends
Beauty which isn't the place I usually
shop I usually either go to Navis or to
Nigel's but I decided to go to friends
and check it out I picked up some new
concealers for my kit I was using the
NARS radiant creamy concealer for a
really long time and I find that I get a
lot of creasing on people now I never
really have creasing under my eyes like
I have some fine lines right under there
and sometimes those will crease but I
really don't have problems with it
myself but I find on other people I kept
getting creasing and it was just so
irritating I felt like especially when
we were having makeup that needed to
last throughout the day I don't know I
just was not happy so I knew I didn't
want to get those again and I really
wanted to pick up the makeup for
everyone so I did I picked up four
different shades of the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD invisible cover concealer I got
the shade Y 23 Y 33 Y 41 and Y 51 these
are all warm toned or yellow toned but I
find that those work for mostly everyone
that I happen to work on and on camera
they usually look really good and it
just works out I also have things for
cooler tones in my kit anyway so I
really
I've been enjoying these I've only used
him a couple of times like I said I just
went up north to shoot and I used them
there they worked out great so I'm
really happy with this purchase I'm glad
to upgrade some things in my kit I
really like this formula because it's
thin but has some coverage to it where's
the other one
it's like thicker and I find the pigment
just kind of bunches up so I will let
you guys know what my thoughts are as I
continue to use these but so far I'm
really happy with those and the last
thing for this haul because seriously
this is like the weirdest assortment of
products I did pick up some dirt some
makeup dirt this is the brand real
creations and they do a dirt called LS
dirt now this is what I had before this
is the 2 ounce bottle and I actually
went through this but I kept it so I
could refill it and I bought the 8 ounce
bottle so I got a better deal on it I
think this was like $24 with my discount
but this is what I used to like dirty
people up I also use powders and whatnot
but I find this gives a nice base and
just kind of can make it look really
dirty really fast it's easy yeah I
deserve a like this so I know I had
talked about doing a tutorial on like
how I dirty people up for camera and I
think by the time this goes up I will
have posted some behind the scenes
photos of what the actors looked like
and I used a lot of this on them as well
as other things so if you want to check
that out go look at my Instagram but
yeah I really like this stuff it just
it's so fast and easy and that's so nice
when you're neither dirty people up or I
need a dirty up a big area not just the
face but if their arms and necks or legs
or any of that is exposed this kind of
makes it easy to do and it looks really
good on camera like it looks real it
looks good ok so that is everything guys

lipstick all over myself
