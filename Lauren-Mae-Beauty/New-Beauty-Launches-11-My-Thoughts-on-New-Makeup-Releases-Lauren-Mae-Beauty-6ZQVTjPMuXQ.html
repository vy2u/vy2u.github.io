Lauren thank you so much for watching
and you know what today is today is
gonna be a new beauty launches there are
some new stuff coming out and I want to
tell you guys my opinions on it this is
kind of a mix between a wish list and a
anti haul it's just whatever I feel
about products I feel like this one and
definitely the state of mind have been
and lately is that I just want to talk
about new makeup but that doesn't mean
like yes or no I'm gonna buy it like I'm
not giving you a definitive answer in
this one specifically and probably from
like here on now and also just like in
any of my cosplay it's more just like
talking about it and just like letting
you know if I think it was a good
concept or not but I would just address
that because as I was writing this list
of new products I was like I don't know
if I can like just say like no I'm not
gonna buy that and I also don't think
like just because I say just because I
like it and think it's a good concept
doesn't mean I want to like own it in my
collection
either anyway let's get into it number
one let's talk about Laura Lee's palette
cat's pajamas this is a $40 palette it
comes with ten different shades and you
can get it now it's available I feel
like a lot of people are really upset
with all these creators coming out with
makeup lines and there's a part of me
that totally understands that and it
just feels like well everyone's making a
makeup line and kind of a part of me is
like but I want to make a makeup line
and I've always like always been my goal
from like the beginning before I even
went to makeup school like I went to
makeup school to learn about makeup so
that I could be more knowledgeable for
when I made my own line so there's part
of me that's like you know oh I want to
do it and everyone's doing it just gonna
be stupid if I do but then there's a
part of me that's like there's enough
room for everyone to do everything and I
think that we should celebrate people
actually like going and creating and you
know I want I don't know Laura and I
want to give her the benefit of the
doubt that she's actually coming out
with products that she loves and that
she thinks her subscribers will love
yeah I don't know I just I think I don't
want it to get personal and so then then
you know there's a party that has to
come back to be like you know what we
should celebrate people's achievements
I'm really happy that she has the money
and you know the ability to create this
and the contacts and I think that's so
great and there that is something to
celebrate to me and so I'm happy for her
for that when it comes to the pellet
personally I do agree with a lot of
people that I feel like concept wise it
was a little bit lacking
I just wish I had a stronger concept
like I said it's called cat's pajamas
and then the names of it are kind of
like little like catchphrases and like
little silly things that she says maybe
cat's pajamas is one of them so maybe
the names and cat's pajamas worked but
then the outside of it was sparkly the
inside of it was like flowers I just
think it could have just had a better
all overall design to make it seem more
cohesive color wise they're very pretty
colors but it's definitely nothing new
that we've seen swatches looked pretty
good though and I don't think that
there's too bad of like I don't think
there's an issue necessarily with
quality when it comes to this palette I
think it's more that people just have
this palette you know what I mean they
have these colors in their collection
and I'm sure that's something you know
the more I've been thinking about it
because again everyone is coming out
with their own makeup line so I've just
been thinking about it and it's like
it's definitely I'm sure hard to come up
with something new and creative
especially in the industry at the moment
because it is so saturated and you want
to come up with something that's new and
innovative but also that people still
want to buy and are gonna wear everyday
because when you see someone come out
with like a really colorful palette then
a lot of people are like well that's not
wearable and a lot of people do not wear
color like I do and I love color but not
everyone does so it's kind of risky to
go that way as well anyway I won't be
buying this palette but I think price
point wise I'm glad it was at $40 and
not 50 I definitely think that she could
have just been like well pallets are $50
and slapped that on there so I
appreciate that it wasn't that expensive
but I think something that would make
this palette even more appealing would
be if it's less expensive than $40 those
are my thoughts on that palette moving
on something drugstore L'Oreal is coming
out with like a galaxy collection it's
gonna be like a launch of three
different types of products one is a
powder highlighting palette that it's
going to be do chrome super exciting for
the drugstore to come out with something
like that I have the Anastacio moonchild
palette I also have a Kat Von D
Alchemist and I love those so for anyone
who was wanting something drugstore I
think it's cool that it's all in one
palette
I know NYX has the duochrome
highlighters too but I do like palettes
especially because it is less product
and hopefully it won't be over $20 the
drugstore is crazy I can definitely see
them putting it at like $19.99 but I
hope that it's a little bit more
affordable than that
so coming out with some lip glosses
which again I think have that like
pearlescent duochrome type of thing
which I think is so awesome I really
want to get my hands on some more
affordable lip glosses like that so I
will definitely be personally looking
out for those and then there are also
some highlighting like sticks like cream
sticks those are something that I
probably won't pick up but if you're
into those they also have that coming
outfit I think it's just a cool
innovative thing for the drugstore it's
not nothing we haven't seen before but I
think it's cool to see a brand like
L'Oreal do it and honestly I feel like
L'Oreal is totally under my radar when
it comes to makeup I feel like a
gravitate to like Rimmel cuz it's
inexpensive
I also gravitate to Maybelline because
it's I don't know I love the fit me so I
always go there so it's kind of cool for
me to see a product from them next we're
talking about more pallets make up
forevers came out with a palette called
illustrious shadows palette it's $49 and
it has 12 different shades it's a really
pretty palette its warm toned it also
has a pink in it I think it's a nice
move on their part for their specific
collection because I think that's
something too one of the complaints I
feel like we have a lot and I have a lot
is like it's like everything else out
there but if that brain it doesn't have
something that is a warm tone palette
that someone can buy it kind of makes
sense for them to want to have one in
theirs their collection for people to
buy you know so that they have an option
for people who want that type of look
but with their products instead of other
people's I don't know if it's just me or
why it's just me but I'm not like that
big of a fan of the make up forevers
formula I used to have a quad with four
of them never used any of them I think I
got rid of all of them yeah I just never
was into it I don't know man so I won't
be picking this up and I I think it's
pretty and I could see why people wanted
I also think that a lot of people
probably have very similar shades to
this but it's pretty I mean looking at
it aesthetically it looks nice and I
kind of liked that they didn't do the
circle pans
I like the square I know it's just
something different and that is
available now the L'Oreal stuff is
available in October just so you guys
know let's talk about Fetty beauty I
kind of mentioned this in my anti haul
butt Fenty beauty's coming out with a
holiday collection which i think is
super cool it's gonna have four lip
glosses four lipsticks three liners
I shadow palette I'm definitely
interested in the eyeshadow palette I
was definitely like the first time I saw
it I was like whoo I really really want
that and then as I see pictures I just
need to see swatches because it looks
very glittery and that can be super
pretty but in reality as much as I love
glitter I don't really go for glitter I
like matte but when it comes to glitter
like falling on my face or anything too
finicky I don't really like to deal with
it like I have solstice and how many
times have I used that since I bought it
not enough for it to be a $20 eyeshadow
so I definitely want to see reviews and
swatches and kind of like give my self
time after it comes out to see if it's
something I want and if it's sold out by
then then it wasn't meant to be we'll
see I also don't think we know a price
on it or at least I don't so that's also
something I kind of want to look at the
lip glosses as well because I really do
like the gloss I got from the initial
launch of her line that one is so nice I
think it's called fenty glow highly
suggested so pretty everyday wearable Oh
perfect so if those are the same formula
I would want to kind of see what they're
about but I kind of feel like the other
ones just perfect like it's the perfect
color and perfect everything's like why
do I need another one I don't know you
know it's kind of one of those things
like am I trying to just collect them
all or do actually you know kind of
actually want another one
that lunch also releases October 13th so
yeah that's a good day that's my
anniversary with Sam 10 whole years man
we've been together crazy moving on
jouer is coming out with a high coverage
foundation it has 17 different shades
which i think is a decent shade range
it's not the best it's not 40 shades but
it's definitely better than you know 5
or 7 or 12 so I will give them that it's
going to be $38 and I've only tried the
matte moisture tint from them and I do
like the formula of it but the color on
me is a little too yellow and a little
bit too dark for what I am currently -
that kind of sucks but I don't know I
just adjus either reviews on it I'm kind
of getting more into foundations and I
really want to find just a couple that I
really really like high coverage isn't
necessarily my favorite thing I like a
medium coverage I really wish the more
Branson fitting out like medium Demi
matte finishes or not super glow
but just like skin I want to just to
look like skin I want to cover up some
of my redness but I still want my skin
to be beautiful and not cakey next is
Besame they are coming out with a whole
80th anniversary collection it's Snow
White themed and mostly what I want to
talk about is the palette it has 20
different shades they are all matte and
it's $68 it is available for pre-order
now the packaging looks absolutely
gorgeous and although I don't think I
will be buying this I feel like this is
a collaboration done right everything
about this is so inspired
Besame is like all about traditional
makeup Snow White is from like the late
1930s so it goes with their brand and
that way I love that all of the colors
in the palette are matte which I feel
like also goes with their brand you know
they aren't trying to put in like duo
crumbs and high shine finishes I mean
when you look at Snow White you think of
like a classic red lip which is
something that they do very well I just
I feel like lorac take notice hello this
is how you do a collaboration and it
doesn't look gimmicky it just works you
know I think they picked this
collaboration very very well I think it
represents their brand it's something
fun and new and innovative for them but
it also again just like falls in line
with their brand it's like to me perfect
it's perfect for what they should be
doing this collection also comes with a
bunch of other products but again I'm
mostly just interested in the eyeshadow
palette the colors are really pretty
they definitely give me Snow White vibes
but again they fall into a branch so
well I don't see anything in there that
just makes me think like what is going
on you know so mostly I wanted to bring
that up because I just think that it's
such a perfect collaboration next
storybook Cosmetics is coming out with a
palette I think they've already come out
with it but it is a Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory now I think this is
just like a fun little palette it has 12
different shades it does retail for $55
which i think is kind of steep like
that's the same price as like Urban
Decay and I'm not saying their quality
isn't worth it but I just think like I
know I know Jeffrey has talked about
them before and I know people know about
them but I also think like we're getting
so used just expensive makeup I just I
don't know man
I can't I'm just more cheap than that
but anyway it looks like a really pretty
palette the packaging is
I like kind of like how they're staying
with their book theme so you could have
them all lined up if you were collector
and have them in a book order or
whatever I think that's a cool idea
it doesn't entice me personally to buy
it I would not buy it for that but I get
the I get the draw from that I like that
it's like a fun mix of neutrals and fun
colors it's cute it's expensive I'm not
gonna buy it but I acknowledge its
existence and last I wanted to talk
about the busy art Golden Hour palette
it has nine different shades it's
retailing for $49 and you can get it now
I believe on Sephora when I first saw
this I did initially think it was
different for them and I'm happy they
came out with it I like that it was in
different packaging like it just seemed
to like something new for them but then
I think I read somewhere I don't know
where I read it but someone was like
this looks like the Mannie and makeup
geek palette and it does it looks very
very similar to that palette so if you
have that you definitely don't need this
one I'm kind of glad the price is $49
too I feel like that's a pretty
reasonable price for fizzy art they're
usually more expensive but then again
you usually get more shadows so um this
one only has nine not twelve which i
think is what their normal is it's
either 12 or 15 I won't be personally
buying this um I think the color combo
is pretty and I think people who you
know really do work off of one palette
might get a lot of use out of it I don't
know it's interesting it's not
mind-blowing to me I think I'm at a
point right now where I'm just not
really looking to buy I did just buy
quite a few new things so I want to
enjoy what I have so I think that's kind
of where my mindset is for this specific
new Beauty launches but I definitely
want to know what you guys think about
some of these products if they're on
your list if they're not and then last
year I just wanted to I just was
thinking about this that's why I'm
talking about it but I was just thinking
right now and it's like sometimes when I
get into these moods where it's like I
just don't want to buy any of this it
just seems like a lot of the same old
stuff it makes me wonder like is my love
for makeup gone and I don't think that's
true just cuz you don't want to buy
everything
sometimes I associate my love for makeup
with how I used to feel like when I was
so euphoric and buying everything but
they aren't the same you know like
having that high of buying all that
makeup isn't the same as loving makeup
you know you don't have to buy
everything new to love makeup and to
show
love for makeup and so that's like
something I'm learning to understand
with myself and to understand that those
emotions aren't necessarily tied to each
other or they don't have to be you know
what I mean like I don't have to prove I
love makeup by buying everything and it
can be fun makeup can still be fun even
if you aren't buying everything new
anyway I don't know just some thoughts
at the end there that I had at this
moment okay that is everything guys
thank you so so much for watching and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
