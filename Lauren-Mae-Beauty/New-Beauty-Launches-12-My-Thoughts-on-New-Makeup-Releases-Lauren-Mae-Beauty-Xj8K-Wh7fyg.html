Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a new Beauty
launches this is a series where I talk
about new beauty products that are
coming out on the market or already on
the market and just kind of give you my
overall thoughts on them I used to do it
kind of like will I buy it will I not
buy it but I don't know I don't know if
I'm gonna buy these just because I think
it's good doesn't mean I'm gonna buy it
so it's just overall thoughts positive
negative in the context of other things
coming out and you guys like it I like
it so let's just get into this one
all right I've moved over so we can show
all the products I do want to mention
really fast though all my pictures come
from trend moods
Instagram which they usually get from
either themselves or from brands
websites or different people so I'm
gonna leave them linked down below but
just you guys know that's where my
pictures come from if you want to check
them out it's also where I get like all
my information on new Beauty stuff
coming out that and the deep fat girl so
they like my too so the first item I
want to talk about is something that's
super duper new I don't even know all
the information on it yet but milt
is coming out with a new eyeshadow stack
I'm so excited and the first color has
been shown I wanted to say leaked but
it's not leaked they leaked it
themselves so they're just like finally
revealing it that's a better word but it
is called skeleton kiss it's a really
pretty kind of peachy pink duochrome
it's not something we haven't seen
before but I really like the name
skeleton kiss I also am excited to see
what the rest of this palette holds but
something a little bit different from
them I don't think they've done any duo
chromes they have a lot of mattes I have
not tried anything from this brand I
would love to I think they come out with
some really awesome products and yeah
I'm excited to see what the rest of the
stack is I don't know the price of it I
believe their stacks are between 40 and
$50 so it'll probably be in that similar
price range and I don't know if it's
gonna be four colors or five most the
stacks of their eyeshadows are for
colors but the rest stack was five so
who knows what they're gonna do but
anyway I think that's super exciting who
knows by the time this video goes up if
they will have more colors or not but I
am excited to see what happens with that
next I wanted to talk about the color
pop palettes that are at Sephora so they
have two different ones they both retail
for $26 which is a bit of a jump for
them in price but there are like more
shadows as well as more product in these
and they also aren't the traditional
light small 12 pea palettes
we've been seing from colour-pop so I
feel like the price increase is not a
big deal to me personally I don't know I
mean it's sex ed it's more but I also
kind of get it and I feel like they're
different whereas if they had given the
exact same formatting and palette and
size and then wanted to charge ten more
dollars for it I'd be a little upset so
anyway the first one is the Golden State
of Mind palette now this is an all
shimmer palette it's all neutrals has
fifteen shades instead of twelve and I
think there's a lot of glitter in it
somewhere I'm red I feel like there it
said that it's kind of like glitter
stoppers or I don't know I just got that
vibe from it I also saw live talked
about this live loves or makeup all
they've really done below if you haven't
checked her out but I think it was like
a live stream she did or something I
don't know I caught a video of her
watching it and kind of talking about it
so I'm gonna probably steer clear of
this palette I know I was tempted at
first because I was so excited to see
something different and different I mean
is in like different packaging and like
formatting not necessarily color wise
because it's not different when it comes
to colors and but I don't really want to
deal with glitter so I will probably not
be picking that palette up and then the
other palette that they have is the
semi-precious palette this has a bit
more of a color range to it it doesn't
have as many shadows and it I believe
it's ten shadows and they're a bit
bigger and everything I don't know this
palette also doesn't really call to me
so I don't think I'm gonna pick up
either of those I'd rather pick up the
two newer palettes that are actually on
colourpop's website and I'd rather have
those than these ones so those are
probably the ones I would pick up before
I picked up these ones or instead of
picking up these ones but just so you
guys know these palettes will be on the
colour-pop website on the 9th of
November so if you wanted to pick them
up but you want to pick them up from
colour-pop instead of sephora you can do
that on a night next I wanted to talk
about BH Cosmetics I had someone asked
recently if I've tried anything from BH
Cosmetics and I haven't I've never tried
anything I've wanted to I really wanted
to try the Carli bybel palette and now
because she's gotten like the second
palette I'd rather try
when than the original but anyway that's
like probably the biggest thing I've
wanted to try from them as well as they
had like these spotlight glow palettes I
don't know they were like six pan
highlighters those are really pretty too
so those are kind of the two things that
brought my attention to them
I feel like BH Cosmetics and Coastal
Scents are really similar and so I've
always gravitated to Coastal Scents for
whatever reason because of the single
shadows and everything but they are
coming out with a Zodiac palette and I
think it looks really interesting I've
heard mostly only good things from BH
especially considering the price robbed
Beauty Christy just did a whole video
like using BH Cosmetics and I love raw
Beauty Christy I'm gonna leave her
channel link down below anything I talk
about anyone I talk about I always like
it just so you guys know and that video
was entertaining but I also think it
kind of shows like how removed sometimes
people can be because they get sent so
much makeup that's like you know prices
just seem abnormally high like that's
just the normal when it's like no maybe
a concealer should only be like five
dollars or six dollars anyway that's a
whole different thing I love her it this
has nothing to do with her I just I was
just thinking things as this was
happening and watching that video so
back to the palette I think it looks
really pretty it has let's see how many
shades I don't know how many she needs
it has but it is gonna be limited
edition it looks kind of similar to Kat
Von D maybe to Loco has a circle of
outside shades which are named after the
zodiac signs and then it has an inner
ring that are matte and then in the very
very center is a highlighter so I don't
know I'm kind of tempted to pick this
one up especially because the price is
pretty good if you get it on when it
first comes out or like pre-order or
whatever it's gonna be $19.99 but if you
get it a little bit later it's gonna be
20 to 99 so a $3 difference not a big
deal
it comes out November 13th and it is
limited edition but yeah that one kind
of piqued my interest I thought it
looked really pretty the shimmer shades
are baked but I've heard really good
things about the other big shadows from
BH Cosmetics so I think this palette
looks kind of cool alright let's move on
next is something from Kim
kardashian-west Beauty line but this is
not a makeup item it is a perfume she's
with three different perfumes the first
one has been revealed and it is the
scent crystal gardenia it's releasing
November 15th I didn't see a price on it
but I am intrigued the bottle looks
absolutely beautiful it's very
gender-neutral it's it's like a frosted
glass kind of crystal bottle what's
happening upstairs but it looked really
interesting I'd love to smell him I wish
there was a place I could go to smell
these things I've been really into
perfumes lately too but I'm excited to
see what the other scents are gardenia
is something that is it smells really
nice and so because that's the first
scent I know about I'm interested to see
what the other ones are so I'm gonna be
like looking out for what they are I
don't know if I'd order them and again I
don't know the price so who knows how
expensive they're gonna be um but I
think that's like an interesting move
and I'm excited to see what they are I
know it's weird I feel like when it
comes to the beauty stuff I haven't been
too impressed with the perfume I'm kind
of into if you guys can't tell I like
eyeshadow palette so I feel like that's
the most I'm gonna talk about in these
videos but next we're talking about the
Buddha Beauty obsessions palettes they
are four different palettes and they're
a lot tinier than her like you know
desert dusk and the rose gold palette
they have nine shadows in them and she's
coming out with again four different
shades one is the smokey obsession the
warm Brown obsession the electric
obsession and the mob obsessions I'm
super into these the price point is
where it's odd it's $27 for nine shadows
this is what I'm talking about people
I love how small these are I love that
they are like a color story the neutral
ones to me are a little bit boring but I
think that a lot of people like neutrals
so I get it the electric palette is
obviously the one that speaks to me I
just love how tiny and compact it is I
think that they look like really great
quality when it comes to the swatches
that I've seen I can't wait to see some
reviews and looks done with them so I am
actually excited about these let me know
your exits Lots it down below but I just
love that they've done what I wanted
they're like compacted these shadows
they're still 9 shades this you can
definitely get some great looks but the
price is also been compacted it's
awesome it's
yes this is perfect all right the next
product I wanted to talk about is from
igk and this is something that I thought
was really interesting these are dual
chrome iridescent foams for the hair
they're gonna come out in January and
they're going to retail for $29 they're
having two different shades and I'm
gonna show a picture that's not that
pretty I don't know we'll see it's like
showing it like actually in the hair and
on a hand and I don't know it's like a
collage I hate collage photos but one of
the colors is called moon rock it's a
pink to teal duochrome how cool is that
and then there is one called meteor
which is a blue to purple the weird
thing about these is that they're
limited edition like I don't know
limited edition hair products it's like
a weird concept to me like I don't get
the point of that um like when you use
it up like you're gonna want it again I
don't know it's weird I just feel like
you go through those more often so it's
just weird it's just weird to me let me
know if you think it's weird too but
these look really cool I don't quite
know how they work I was tricked trying
to figure it out I don't know if they go
in your hair and then like the foam is
it or if you put the foam in and you
would like dry your hair or really what
and how you use these but I think the
concept is really cool I think that the
moon rock one seems really cool
obviously I'm drawn to the pink one but
I love that it flashes teal which i
think is a really cool contrast and I'm
definitely interested I want to like
keep my eye out I want to see some
people use it that like I want to see
videos of people using these products
and how they use them and make them work
so but I think that's like such a cool
concept three more products to talk
about next is the Far Sally jelly bean
highlighter I've been seeing a couple
videos using this product talking about
this product there's a little bug in
here at least it's not as bad as the
freaking bug in my mask movie I know
like not as many people saw that review
I did a mask in a movie review and stuff
a freaking huge bug tried to attack me
in this huge moth it was like the
scariest thing ever it was horrible
anyway totally getting sidetracked here
but the far solid jelly bean highlighter
this is not something I'm personally
interested in I know everyone's trying
out this is such a different call
and like I guess it is because it is
like a jelly consistency but um like
it's basically the cream like I don't
know I don't understand how it's that
that much different than a highlighter
would be if it was like a liquid or
cream like it doesn't like change it up
enough for it to be this like insane
concept I think it looks really blinding
I can get people like cream highlighters
and or liquid highlighters and they want
something really blinding it looks
pretty on the skin I'm not like trying
to like bash them or anything I'm just
saying when it comes to like influencers
talking about it I'm just like okay it
jiggles I'm probably not gonna pick this
one up because it's not really my style
specifically but I think some people
will really like it and it seems like an
okay product the way I've seen it
perform it looks fine but yeah I don't
know I just wanted to let touch up on
that it's like a new product coming out
next is something from Julia's place now
I feel like I don't have that much
information I only saw like one picture
more recently from trend mood on this
but it's the deuce palette is that how
we say it it's coming out in November
and it has nine different shades in it
and I'm gonna have a picture here
obviously but I don't really like the
colors of this I feel like a lot of the
palettes movies place are super
inspiring to me I'm excited to try them
I like the way the color combos are I
like that they would work for a bunch of
different skin tones like I am so
excited to try this brand they're on my
freakin list but this palette I'm not
feeling it I don't really like the color
combination I don't get the inspiration
maybe if I knew a little bit more about
that it would like make more sense to me
at least even if I didn't like the
colors it makes sense but right now it's
just like weird I think it's kind of a
weird color combination and mix
definitely unique but not necessarily in
a good way so I will not be picking that
one up
and last year I wanted to talk about the
balm boiled again palette they came out
with a new palette I believe it is all
shimmers and they're all like foiled
eyeshadows this retails for $34 there's
12 different shades and the packaging is
super cute because of course it's the
bomb and they do that old-school
packaging this one has like a superhero
theme on it like they're foiled again I
just AM kind of over
a little bit like I know me not in a
mean way I just I don't know I feel like
the last palette I tried from them to
bone Appetit Thor the ball male petite I
did not like that palette
I thought the shadows and they were
pretty doing bad so yeah I don't know
we'll see I can't wait to see reviews on
it and see like real swatches and live
action and stuff like that but um I
probably won't pick this one up either I
think the price point of it is nice like
it's not too too expensive which i think
is good it's still very like neutral
even though there are some light colors
to it there's nothing that exciting to
me about it
we'll see again swatches if there's that
crazy metallic then that could be
something but I have a feeling they
might not be soon we'll see alright guys
those are all the products I want to
talk about in this video let me know
what you guys those thoughts are on them
down below I would love to hear what you
have to say and that's everything thank
you so so much for watching guys and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
