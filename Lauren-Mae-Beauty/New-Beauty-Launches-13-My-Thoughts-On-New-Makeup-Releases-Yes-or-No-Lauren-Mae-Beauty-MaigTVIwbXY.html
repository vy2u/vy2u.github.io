Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing any new
Beauty launches I haven't done one of
these in forever but this is a series
that I started where I just talked about
new releases what I think about them if
I'm interested if I'm not why I'm not
why I am and yeah it's just like a fun
way to discuss new products without
having to actually buy them which is
also awesome because I like to be picky
about our purchases I think that's
important we all don't have a million
dollars to buy all the makeups so yeah
let's get into some of the new releases
and my thoughts on them so the first
thing I want to talk about is from NYX
and it's the mochi line it's like a
bunch of new products that they're
coming out with I believe it's three
different eye shadow palettes there's a
couple like highlighter palettes and
other products in there I'm the most
interested in the eyeshadows because I
love eyes shadows and if I'm not
mistaken I believe these have like a
gushy texture you know very scientific
here but no they have like a very soft
texture to them kind of like the color
pop shadows or the Maybelline Dream
bouncy blush is like a very similar
situation but these look really cool I
think they're probably gonna be a little
bit out of my price range for what they
are and everything but I think the
collection is kind of fun but I love
color I love like the bright stuff I
love like the pastels so when it comes
to looking at this collection just right
off I'm very attracted to it I just
don't know if I'm actually gonna pick
anything up from it
I would have to get it on like a really
really good sale for me to even like try
it out I also really want to see some
reviews and stuff on it so I'm waiting
for some of those to pop up in my feed
but um yeah this line looks it looks
okay I don't know I think it's
interesting NYX just does so many
different collections and releases it's
sometimes hard to keep up with them all
oh okay one I am so excited about guys
sol de janeiro came out with the hand
cream what okay if you guys saw my sol
de janeiro video i at the end of it
products that i wish they would come up
with and i'm pretty sure i had mentioned
that i wish they had a hand cream so i
am super stoked for this
I love sol de janeiro products i love
the smell of them I love hand creams
it's like a match made in heaven so I
definitely want to pick this up this is
something that's like on my wish list
yeah I hope
it probably will be amazing I just think
they do some great formulas I love the
smell like I mentioned I love a
packaging I just I really have been
connected to this brand so I am so
excited for this release and think it's
such a great like move it fits a line
with their products and everything so I
want that product next I wanted to talk
about the Kat Von D anti precision
eyeliner and this was in collaboration
with the main lead singer of Green Day I
thought this was a really cool collab I
mean it's kind of a basic product in
that it's like a jumbo black eyeliner
pencil but I think it's cool collab to
you know do it with someone who is a
rock star and is like known for his
eyeliner and I don't know I like the
idea of this I think it's fun I probably
won't pick this up personally I don't I
don't use a lot of eyeliner I'm a little
bit more on the colorful side than like
the dark side but I think it's a good
release for her line it's definitely on
brand and on trend for her I just
thought it was interesting that she had
collabed I mean I don't know if it's
like in collaboration or if it's more
just he's a part of the marketing of it
but I thought that was a really cool and
different way to promote it and I
enjoyed it alright next I want to talk
about the hourglass vanish highlighting
Stix this is in a similar packaging I'm
not sure about formula but to their
foundation Stix and I love that
foundation stick I think it's really
great I love the finish on the skin so
this is something that I'm interested in
because I like the foundation so much
although I don't tend to use cream
highlighters very often so yeah the
biggest thing for me this retails for
$42 it's going to be available on the
9th of January it comes in five
different shades and it's just expensive
I know hourglass is expensive and I do
think that their products are really
nice especially if you want something
that's going to kind of like complete
your skin and finish your skin without
necessarily being super full coverage I
think they have a really cool look and
feel to their brand specifically it's
just it's it's just really expensive I
think for a highlighter and not a base
product like this isn't gonna go all
over your whole face my car just ran out
of space so I don't exactly know air was
but because of the price on this I just
think it's so expensive
so it's something I'm interested in and
I'm gonna watch reviews on if they pop
up in my feed but I'm not probably going
to buy this I don't think I'll buy it
yeah I would love to like get it and try
it but to actually like part my money
with it
not sure and I also think it's a great
line for them like it's a good release
for their brand it's just I don't know
if I want to spend my money on it next
let's talk about the morph 824 G grande
glam palette it's basically a neutral
palette with a pink in it you're not
fooling me there's just like one pink
it's not different I know I'm not gonna
get that I just I think that sometimes
with the morphe palettes it's just so
many eyeshadows in one palette that it's
hard to have a cohesive theme it's just
so much eye shadow I think if they had
if they drop down the size of their
palettes and then have like a really
good theme I would be more interested in
some of the color stories that they
would create but I don't think that they
are creating color stories they're just
creating neutral Browns and sometimes
they put a pop of something in there I'm
just I'm really not interested in it i
think that morphe shadows the ones that
I've tried are great for the price if
you don't have those already but for me
in my collection what I need it's about
getting things that are a bit different
or things that are inspiring even if
they're not different but maybe the way
they have configured a palette or the
inspiration behind it is inspiring to me
and makes me want to use it and create
cool looks and just have fun with my
makeup that's worth it to me but most of
the things that I see from morphe are
not like that so yeah I don't know it's
not like an exciting release to me at
all and I will not be picking that up
next I wanted to talk about the bomb and
this is something they are coming out
with a palette let me look it up this is
the meat matte maker Oh like it's a
match maker got it okay so this is the
meat matchmaker palette and this one is
really cool because it has a matte and a
shimmer like duo it throughout the
palette and I think that's really cool I
think the color selection on this is a
little bit more interesting than a lot
of their past palettes I'm interested in
this I don't know if I'm
purchase it I would definitely only
purchase any of the bomb stuff out like
half off so I would wait for a sale or
wait till I could get it at a really
good price but I'm excited I'm sure
Kaley will be doing a video on it so I
will be waiting for her video this one
is actually kind of exciting and kind of
cool to me I'm really hoping that it's a
good formula it's I think a good
addition to their line and I like that
they did the mat and the shimmer it's
wearable and usable but also fun colors
like I think it's a good mix of
everything but let me tell you how much
that's gonna retail for though
2950 that's pretty good that's still a
pretty good price so but I think get it
for half off $15 you know that's a good
price next let's talk about the Too
Faced white peach palette um I'm
conflicted I'm torn by this palette I'm
going back to my phone to look up some
pics you know I'm very torn by this
palette because it's I think the idea of
it potentially could be really good but
I just don't know if the execution of it
is it's it's on the screen you guys know
it's just a lot of light shades in it
and then they have like this kind of
like sparkly I don't even know if it's
blue or purple I don't know how I feel
about it it's just not gonna work for a
lot of people they already had the white
chocolate bar palette I look at the
palette and I initially think oh that's
pretty but when I look at it in the
context of their line what they already
have when I look at it based off the
fact that it's kind of like a sister ish
palette to the PG mattes palette that
they put out I'm kind of just like I
don't know how I feel about it I
probably won't be purchasing this
palette it's nothing that new or
different I wish they had stuck to just
mattes I wish they went more cool toned
with it had more of a range of shades
from light to dark so it could work for
more people and just be more dynamic of
a palette so yeah mmm I think it's a
Miss but nice try
maybe I don't know how I feel yeah
probably won't buy it I love the
packaging that was super cute unless I
wanted to talk about the Stila glitter
and glow highlighters these are a
spinoff of their glitter and glow
eyeshadows that they've had
and I think this is a really cool idea
these look really fun and ethereal which
is definitely something I'm drawn to and
kind of my style I don't know if I don't
pick these up because again they're so
expensive I'm just I you know just
because I think I think something I'm
realizing is just because I think
something is a cool idea doesn't mean I
have to have it in my own collection
like I can be like oh that's really cool
and that's really beautiful but I don't
have to own it to like support it
necessarily you know what I mean but
anyway I think these are really pretty I
will definitely be waiting for looks and
like reviews on these products because
I'm sure they'll be all over because
people loved the eyeshadow so much from
them it says on trend mood that these
are gonna retail for $30 each so I you
know it's definitely a pricier product
but I'm interested to see how they work
they might be something that will be
just such a fun special thing but we'll
see as they come out which will be in
the spring of 2018 which i think is a
great spring release because of the
colors they're releasing so I don't know
I'm excited for that launch if it gets
exciting anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this new beauty launches let me know
what products you're excited for her
aren't excited for in the comments down
below and what your thoughts are on
these products if you want them if you
don't why it's fun to kind of have a
discussion about products before you
just like go and buy them so you can
hopefully narrow it down to the items
that you're really gonna be happy with
in your collection that's what I'm all
about
I love just you know buying makeup but
buying makeup that I'm gonna love and
use and enjoy that's the best part just
get rid of the hype and narrow your
vision you know I hope you're enjoying
your day thank you so much for watching
guys and I will see you in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
