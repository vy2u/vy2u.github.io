Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another new
Beauty lunches I say it all the time but
stuff is always coming out so I thought
it'd be fun to talk about some of the
new releases my thoughts on it and just
kind of just talk about the new makeup
without having to buy it I'd love to
hear also what your AC's thoughts are on
this makeup down in the comments but
other than that let's just get into some
new products alright so the first thing
I want to talk about it's probably the
newest thing that is on this list and
this is the sugar pill and little little
twin stars Club I know I just talked
about trends I want to see dye and are
like you know brands collaborating with
random other brands essentially but I
think this one works really well I'm not
super familiar with little twin stars
but this collection looks so sugarpill
it looks so fun and bright and I'm not
sure if I'm gonna pick it up but I
definitely am tempted the collection has
two liquid lipsticks in it I won't be
picking either of those up one's a hot
pink and one's a teal it also has an
eyeshadow palette and of course that's
what I want it has like a baby blue a
nice mint green a yellow slash gold a
taupe a pink and then kind of a bronzy
color at least from what I saw it did a
same format as their Edward Scissorhands
palette and kind of their Fancy Feast is
that what it was fancy love I don't know
they're one that came out last February
for Valentine's Day it just looks so
cute it's so sugarpill like I said and I
am really happy about this one I think
it's really fun I definitely can see why
they did it it's also coming out with a
makeup bag which I would not pick up but
I am super excited about that one it was
just something really fun to see in my
feed but again I love color so it
probably isn't a surprise that I like
that one it's just unconventional in a
fun way and last for sugar pill I wanted
to mention that that collection is
coming out on February 1st so if you
want it that's when it's going to
release next let's talk about Blood Moon
cosmetics and their orb of light palette
this is going to be releasing on the 9th
of February it has 8 matte shades in it
it's gonna retail for $48 and it looks
really really beautiful something that I
kind of like to note is that I realize
we're all kind of tired of like the same
old thing but something I like to think
about our brands specifically and what
they have in their collection and if a
brand
have a bunch of matte shades or shadows
it makes sense for them to come out with
maybe some neutrals or colors that
people are gonna want to buy even if
those colors are done a million times so
I think this is a great release for them
and their brand I love that they're all
matte I think it's very much their style
it's a little bit expensive but the
packaging I believe is actually plastic
and not cardboard so I hope that's the
case and you know it's a little bit more
expensive packaging the colors look
really pretty there's some warm shapes
there's some cooler shades I think that
you could do a lot of things with it and
the pigmentation on some of the swatches
I've seen looks amazing so that is
definitely one that I think is like an
exciting release again not sure if I'm
gonna pick them up I don't know if I'm
gonna pick any of these up but I can
still be excited about it okay next
let's move on to honest us yet Beverly
Hills the first launch they let us know
about which was kind of like a weird
leak was the soft glam palette I think
this palette is pretty but it's really
boring I definitely don't want to pick
it up myself I think if someone has not
tried Anasazi shadows before and likes a
neutral look they'd really like this
palette I'm hoping that the formula is
gonna be really awesome but for me and
my collection it's definitely not a
must-have I think I also just prefer the
modern renaissance I like something with
a little bit more punch so definitely
not something I'm gonna pick up I mean I
was a little bit disappointed but I
guess it makes sense with you know the
palettes that they have been coming out
with have been kind of colorful so maybe
they're toning it down for something
different
I don't really know it was whatever but
the other item for whatever reason
definitely I'm like looking at the
pictures I'm probably not gonna buy it
but this is the highlighter in
collaboration with amrezy and this is
going to release February 14th it's
gonna be $28 and it looks so beautiful
it's like a soft gold I don't know if
it's gonna be like this a new
revolutionary color but let me tell you
the swatches look really pretty if I was
a medium skin tone you best believe I
would pick that highlighter of I think
it might be a little bit too dark on me
so and I'm also just not like a super
highlighter girl but that one looks so
pretty in the pictures I cannot deny it
and then just so you guys know I believe
this off glam palette is coming out
sometime in March and it's probably
gonna retail for their normal $42 next
let's move on to
but they're having a whole ocean Jules
collection coming out this has a
highlighter palette in it with five
brand new shades which is exciting it's
gonna retail for $48 and I like the
packaging I think it looks really pretty
it looks like these are gonna be some
like more fun or iridescent colors which
I'm kind of surprised at because it
seems like they're like flashing
highlighters didn't sell that well
because they went on clearance and
everything but I think that's a really
fun palette don't know if I'm gonna pick
it up but I like the idea of this
collection I think it looks super fun
for spring and summer they're also
coming out with an eyeshadow palette and
I think the packaging at some points is
beautiful and then there's a part of me
that's just like it's so much wasted
space inside though I don't know why
there's all this extra space it just
looks like a lot of bulky packaging and
I'm just not a fan of the inside but I
love the fact that it looks like a
seashell on the outside this is gonna
have seven new shades in it and it
retails for $35 I think that's a decent
price for the palette actually but I
probably won't pick that up and then the
last thing in that collection is the lip
gloss and this is like a color-changing
lip gloss it changes to like you know
fit your lips and your specific color I
don't know okay like over these I think
this one looks really pretty when I see
it in the packaging but then when I look
at like the description of what it does
I don't think I'm gonna like the actual
outcome on my lips because usually it
just stains my lips bright pink but yeah
so I probably won't pick that up and it
retails for $25 it's gonna be super
expensive I just think that's like way
too much for a gloss of that nature
there are so many other ones out there
so I'm a little disappointed with that
one and we're moving through them today
next let's talk about devious place
they're having a whole festival
collection so this has a palette in it
which is the festival palette I love
this I think it's beautiful I love the
colors I love the finishes everything
about this like it just looks so
beautiful to me it's definitely
something that's tempting me and I
honestly I have the saharan palette and
I really really love it I also have the
Zulu palette and I think that one's
really nice too but out of all the
pallets that she has this is the next
one the festival one that's coming out
this is the one that is the most
tempting next
saharan palette because I don't know the
colors just look fun where some of the
other ones it's just like brown warm
neutrals with some blues in it like
that's all I see over and over but this
one looked really really pretty so I
definitely am excited to see some
swatches I want to see some tutorials I
want to see people use them but the
colors look amazing there are two liquid
lipsticks that are coming out with it as
well one is like a matte black which is
kind of cool and then the other one is
like an orange --red at least that's
what I got from pictures um I've got a
liquid lipstick person so I'm not gonna
pick any of those up but I think they're
kind of fun colors to go with the shades
in the palette next is kind of a weird
one this is from makeup forever and it's
the starlet palette this is not
available in the US and it was only
available online for 24 hours it was
like a weird flash sale the palette
looks like a mix between the metal matte
palette in composition of colors and how
they're formatted in the palette but
then it looks like the Naked palette
when it comes to actual color selection
it's very strange the packaging is
definitely different for makeup forever
as well I don't understand why this
wasn't available in the US and kind of
like why it was only available for 24
hours it's just like all kind of weird
like why would you make a product to
just sell for 24 hours I don't really
know what the catch is if they're just
like testing their market or I don't
know I don't know what they're doing but
um
it's kind of weird let me know if you
pick that up if you're like from out of
the u.s. and you saw that I wanted to
pick it up and you did or anything like
that I would love to know what you guys
think about that two more to talk about
next is from Kevin of Quan and this is
the prison magic highlighter trio and
this is available now it retails for $48
which is kind of expensive it has three
really beautiful shades in it one's
lavender one speech and one is a green I
don't know when I saw swatches of this
immediately I was like oh it's so pretty
I don't know why I'm just like drawn to
it I love dual chromes and your doesn't
colors I know a lot of people are over
them I don't love to wear them as a
highlight all the time although I am
wearing like a Becca one right now but I
just think they're so pretty like they
just draw me in they're so fun
the price is kind of expensive because
this is a smaller palette you can tell
like when the girls holding it in her
hand
but I think that they look really pretty
I would love to swatch these in person
and see what they look like and last I
have Urban Decay's disco Queen
collection which is also available now
it has two different products in it one
is a holographic highlighter stick and
one is just a regular holographic
holographic highlighter and these are
both in like a really pretty purple
lavender blueish kind of tint again
we're going with that kind of iridescent
look I think these work well in Urban
Decay's line I think they work well with
their image I just think it's a little
bit late like I feel like milk makeup
did this already so many brands have
done this already so it's just a little
bit late on the trend they both retail
for $26 which again it's just kind of
expensive I got I don't know if I'm
gonna shell out the money for something
I wanted to be something I'd like just
so excited about and something that's so
different from anything else I might
have in my collection so for me these
just aren't different enough to get
unless I do pick up something from other
brands but I have so I don't know they
look cool but I probably won't pick them
up I would like to watch some videos on
them though for sure like if J Kista
does something which I could see her
doing I would love to see what they look
like alright guys that is everything for
this new beauty launches let me know
what your thoughts are on these products
down in the comments and I will see you
in my next video thank you so so much
