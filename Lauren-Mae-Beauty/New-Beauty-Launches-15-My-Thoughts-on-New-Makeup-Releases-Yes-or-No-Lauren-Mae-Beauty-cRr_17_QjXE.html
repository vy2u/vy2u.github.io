Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is the last video today I promise
but I just want to Estate that this is a
fake piercing it is raining so there's
noise and that's it let's get into the
video though this is going to be a new
beauty launches and I'm really excited
to talk to you guys about some new
products whether I think they're good or
not this is just a way we can discuss
new products without actually buying
them and I like that I love seeing what
companies are coming out with and I know
that there's a lot of oversaturation
right now and I think I might do a tube
top on that I had a request for that in
my last one why I'm still hopeful that
there are some that there can be some
cool things coming out so it's always
fun for me to look on trend moves
Instagram account which all the pictures
on this screen are gonna be coming from
her account I will leave her Instagram
link down below but that's where I and I
feel like everyone gets all their makeup
news about new releases coming out she's
just like always on it so I'm gonna stop
talking and get into the product so
first off I'm really excited about this
one these are new Clinique cheek pop
blushes so this is not a new product in
their line but they are coming out with
four new shades and I'm excited about
that I don't know if I'll purchase any
of these but the Clinique cheek pop
blushes are one of my favorite formulas
I really like that they have a nice
subtle Sheen to them so they're not
matte but they're definitely not like
overly flowy they're not gonna emphasize
any texture so I think it's exciting for
them to have some new colors in their
line these are something like if I was
in Sephora I would definitely go by and
swatch them and see what the colors look
like next is a new range of products
from dose of colors these are their
eyeliners are coming out with 10
different shades and these are exciting
to me I feel like I've just been talking
about wanting to buy new gel eyeliners
but really haven't I need to actually
like buy them but I just there's so many
different brands and I want to make sure
I buy the right ones and also on really
cheeps home like can all of them be like
two dollars please anyway the colors
look really pretty in this line they are
mostly all neutrals or variations of
neutrals like nothing in here are super
bright and like pops of color I feel
like they've done a lot of like subtle
Burgundy's and oranges and things like
that but they're definitely still in a
very neutral realm what do you think is
kind of interesting and different I
would have loved to see just some bright
colors cuz that's what I really want but
I think that these will sell
for people who want to go a little bit
outside of their comfort zone but not
too much okay
the next product is from glam glow and
guess what they're doing you know they
got some limited-edition skincare coming
they are coming out with glitter vests
and gravity mud masks but they're
collabing with my little freaking pony
what is up with my little pony like I'm
sorry what is happening why has the
makeup industry been taken over by my
little freaking pony Heather from Love
Heatherette if you guys don't know her
channel go check it out I'm gonna leave
her down below I love her she messaged
me on Instagram because it was right
after I had posted my like things on
sale at Sephora video and she was like
look at them they're coming out with my
little pony stuff like I can't tell if
this is a good sign like my little pony
is just like really popular or if it's
like they're desperate for like
collaborations to get money like I don't
know what's going on they're really
pretty colors they're pink and I think a
black and a purple but if we get to the
actual products and not the full
franchise that they're collaborating
with the glitter masks I think is stupid
I don't think that glitter masks are
cute and that seems so like not me cuz I
like glitter and I like fun things but
if I'm gonna my skin care I don't really
want it to be super glitzy glammy I
don't care about that I wanted to just
work or I want it to be inexpensive and
this is like 50 mixing two of the things
I feel like I don't want in skincare
plus I believe that I don't know if it's
the gravity mud or if it's the glitter
mass but one of them is retailing for
fifty nine freaking dollars and there's
no way there's no freaking way so yeah
I'm not interested don't want those I
think it's just hilarious that I talked
about it and then boom here we go here's
another one alright number four is
exciting to me because y'all know i love
a sol de janeiro i'm actually on their
PR list you guys how exciting is that
but anyway they're coming out with two
new products one is a glow oil this does
come in two different colors i'm not an
oil person but you know i'm excited for
the release i think it fits really well
with their line it's definitely very
beachy and if it just fits with
everything so i mean i'm just naturally
excited i'm so biased i love their
friend i don't know how much I would use
this product but I think it works well
with their line and I'm excited for it
and then they have some
bombs that they're coming out with which
i think is kind of cool they already
have some shower products and so this
fits in line with that plus I love the
smell they're like signature caramel
pistachio smell I believe it is is great
and I think it would work really nice in
a bath so I might need to actually like
clean my bath and get myself in a tub
because that I think would be a nice
experience moving on benefit is coming
out with some new foundations these are
the hello happy soft blur foundations
they're a shear medium coverage which is
something that I like I love that finish
I was kind of surprised that they
weren't coming out with something super
full coverage because I feel like that
is what's popular right now so I feel
like it's a little strange remove like
y'all get in there get something going
but I'm happy for myself
this is only coming in twelve shades
which is disappointing to me I think
that's something that we've all kind of
complained about is that benefit doesn't
have a very inclusive shade range at all
and it just would have been nice for
them to at least have maybe like 20
shades 25 shades like just kind of
update I do think sometimes with sheer
coverage you can kind of get away with
you know going one way or another but a
medium coverage is still a normal
foundation and I just think that twelve
shades could have been expanded I think
what will be the real test though is to
see how they've divvied up the shade
range between the 12 different
foundations so are we gonna get ten
light ones and two dark ones or are they
gonna be more even on the spectrum if
they are that way then I can at least
respect that but I do wish already that
they came out with more and the
packaging is kind of weird on this it's
like a smiley face like it's a little
bit different than what I was expecting
from them I don't know
interesting I am definitely interested
to see some reviews on it and interested
to see how those shades play out number
six on my list is a product from Oprah
and this is the free spirit palette
someone actually tagged me in this on
Instagram and was like oh does this
inspire you and I think that looking at
this it's really pretty I like the
different colors there's just something
about some of the Oprah products when I
see them I just get turned off because I
feel like it looks kind of cheap like in
the black packaging or whatever which
I'm fine with some cheap makeup like
again I'll
saving money I like things to be
inexpensive so I'm down with it looking
a little cheap if it's gonna be a cheap
price but this palette retails for $79
and I know that over kind of has that
whole system set up where you like save
a bunch of money when you use coupon
codes and then they also have to pay
influencers their cut and everything but
I just feel like it's expensive for what
you're getting and the packaging you're
getting I know everyone freaking loves
the highlighters and I do have results
on the highlighters that one in my you
decide when I buy video so I will be
getting that information to you probably
and I get ready with me and then I'm
gonna buy them and test them also if you
have any suggestions on how I should do
the testing video let me know anyway
back to this palette if it has eight
different eyeshadows in it two different
blushes a full-size highlighter in
Beverly Hills I don't know it's one with
like the PI pieces so it has a bunch of
different colors it has a mini
highlighter in Rodeo Drive I believe and
then a banana
Shh like set under the eye or whatever
there's just something about it like I
like the colors I like the style I just
wish it looked more permanent I wish you
didn't look so cheap and I think that
they also replay a lot of their same
products like Rodeo Drive is in there in
Beverly Hills and if you're a really big
fan of Ophir you might already have
those products which really decreases
the value for you so I'm just kind of
so-so about that one another product
from benefit probably should have put
that with the other one but whatever
this is the gold rush blush and I don't
know I'm just kinda like over there
blushes I feel like they're coming out
with very similar colors to me this one
California and then I have rocket or I
believe those are their most recent
colors I love rocket wanna have pan and
rocket or I love it it's the one I
suggest to basically anyone who's like I
just want a blush for everyday I love
that flush but I'm just over the like
glitter overspray and the very neutral
colors and I just want to see more from
them like I talked about this in the
brands that I want to see more from and
it's like they already have blushes in
their collection that they're known for
and that they're popular for so I just
think it would benefit them or move them
if we're gonna get fancy to do something
that is different like some eyeshadows
and some eyeliners but aren't like the
gimmicky you know gel eyeliner in the
pen form Texas
I just think they have room to expand so
many other areas that I don't know why
they are coming out with another blush
oh don't mind me huh
just getting the lipstick ring off my
lips anyway I'm pretty sure if they
didn't they're probably going to wear
they're just going to put this blush
with all their other products that you
already have and trying to like sell it
to you for $56 and you think it's a good
deal because it's a bunch of products
and if you're a first time makeup lover
it probably is a good deal but for
everyone else it's not so yeah Miep meet
me next on the list I have some products
from iOS and I'm really excited they're
branching out into some more like
skincare and just more products than the
lip balms
I remember when EOS was like the
everyone had it they loved all the
different colors and a little Easter
eggs oh it was also exciting but they
have quite a few new products I just
wrote down the ones that I'm the most
excited about so they have a sugar scrub
coming out and I'm just like into sugar
scrubs and lip treatments and balms
lately so they are exciting to me the
sugar scrubs gonna retail for $10
they're having a lip mask come out
that's also gonna be $10 but they also
have some skincare like for your face
products they're having a skin prep I
think like lotion type of thing $20 and
they're having a glistening lotion for
20 which i think is just like kind of a
more luminizing lotion for the skin so
those are really exciting $20 is a
little bit high but also not too high I
guess for drugstore anymore so yeah I
think those look exciting and I would
definitely want to see some reviews see
some people try it out and see if it's
worth the price we're getting close to
the end to more kind of like product
categories to talk about we have a
collection from colour-pop imagine it
can you imagine having a new collection
from colour-pop this is a collaboration
with my life as ava is it I think it you
say it Ava I'm not subscribed to her but
she's a really big youtuber on the
platform it's a collection with two
different eyeshadow quads one's more of
a warm toned brown one has like a purple
in it so I'm gonna call it a purple cool
tone bellybutton
really only have like one purple if you
really look at it it has a lip bundle
and then a face duo I think how these
look pretty probably not something that
I'm going to go for I mean there's
nothing wrong with them I think they're
pretty they do seem to be targeted for a
different skin tone than me because ava
is also like a darker so that's perfect
for her so that's great for people with
a darker skin tone art you know more
medium skin tone so yeah I think that's
nice it's just not something that really
calls to me and last is a really awesome
product from Kat Von D she's coming out
with a whole set of new brow products
she's having some brow powders brow
pencils those are gonna come each in
seven different shades and more like the
natural hair shades and then she's
coming out with I think it's like 14
different brow pomade and 7 of them are
gonna be again in those natural shades
but then seven of them are in like fun
awesome colors which I got that pink ere
so I think it's cool that a brand is you
know coming out some brow products that
could match your colored hair and I
think it works really well with her
brand since it's a little bit more
alternative I feel like if someone has
colored hair they might be more drawn to
Kat Von D products than not so it seems
like it'll really fall in line with the
brand and her customers I do kind of
want to try the pink one but I will say
there are so many other products you can
use in your brows like you don't have to
use something that's specifically for
your brows and your brows to do your
brows but I do think it's cool that it's
kind of like one of the first products
in a mainstream line that's coming out
with colored brow products for
specifically the brows and representing
people with colored hair so that's
everything onto the new beauty list for
today let me know what you guys think
about any of these products down below
are you excited for them are you not do
you want them do you not or if there's
anything else on this list that I didn't
mention but you are excited for let me
know and that's everything thank you so
so much for watching guys and I will see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
