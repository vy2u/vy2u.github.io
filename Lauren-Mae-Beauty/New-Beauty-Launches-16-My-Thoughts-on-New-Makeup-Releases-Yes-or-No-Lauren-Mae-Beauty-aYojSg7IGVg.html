Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a new beauty
launches this is a video series that I
do where talk about new makeup releases
and I let you guys know just my thoughts
on it do I want to do I not am i
interested am I not why do I think it
fits with the brand just some of my
opinions on some of the makeup coming
out so I believe the plate let's link
down below if you want to check out
other things but other than that let's
just get into these new items I feel
like lately I've been like more excited
by makeup than normal so yeah also if
you want to know how I did this eye look
I did it with my boxy charm stuff which
I will leave link down below as well if
you want to check that out alright so
let's get into it the first item I want
to talk about is actually a
collaboration between the Sigma and
Sunday Riley this was kind of a weird
collaboration to me because I think of
Sunday Riley have such a huge beauty
brand they are very expensive skincare
brand and then Sigma does a bit more of
like affordable stuff I know that
they're not like drugstore prices but
they're definitely not crazy expensive
but they are coming out with a skincare
brush set it has six different brushes
in it I didn't find a price on this yet
but I thought this was just interesting
no you don't need specific brushes for
skincare it's definitely a very bougie
thing but I feel like Sunday Riley is
kind of bougie so it kind of works out
and if you're someone who takes your
skin care that seriously I feel like you
might take your skin care brushes that
seriously so I don't think it's
necessarily super strange definitely not
something I would do I use like a
Michaels craft paint brush to put on my
masks and that's really the only like
tool I use to put on any skin care
besides in my kit I guess but you can
use a foundation brush there just so
many other brushes you could use but I
think it's an interesting concept and
I'll be interested to see if anyone
likes it you know what the reviews are
as it comes out so let me know you guys
think about that one next on the list is
the fresh sugar coconut hydrating lip
balm I don't have the price on it so
I'll leave it on the screen somewhere
but it is available now I'm excited for
this I would definitely try this out
especially because fresh has some of my
favorite lip balms on the market I love
the fresh sugar lip treatments they're
my favorite I love the original one I
love that lemon scent to it so this is
very interesting I hate that it's in a
pot but I can get over it because it's
coconut and I freakin my love for
coconut is so Dee
I freaking love it so much so I am
interested in this product the only
thing is I'm scared it's gonna be a
little bit greasy for some reason like I
don't know why I don't know if it's
because of like coconut oil or whatever
but I'm just like nervous it's gonna be
a little bit like shiny and greasy on
the lips and a little bit thin but it's
definitely something that I have on my
radar a couple of you guys actually
tagged me in the picture of this so
thank you guys and so it is on my radar
but we'll see how the reviews are on
that as well alright so next is another
collaboration
this is Inglot and J Lo's collaboration
this is a limited edition I believe it's
forest summer but it's a collection of
70 items it's crazy but the only part
I've seen a picture of is this like face
palette so it has four different powders
in it one of them is a little bit bigger
and then it has three smaller ones it's
going to retail for $49 and it's just
I'm not interested I don't know I mean
JLo is obviously a different skin tone
than me so maybe if you had a more
similar skin tone to her this collection
would really appeal to you more because
it's just probably gonna suit you better
but I just I don't know it's just not
really you know that specific item isn't
really doing it for me but there are 70
items coming out so I'm sure something
will grab my attention right so I'm not
completely writing it off and I know
that there are a ton of celebrity makeup
lines and collaborations especially as
of lately and I get the back and feel
kind of just exhausting but I think it's
still cool like I think that it's great
I mean as much as we say like this is
boring and oh my gosh enough enough
enough would we really want it to like
completely end like no new makeup coming
out like I still like makeup like I like
it coming out so I'm interested to see I
still give everything a chance you never
know which makeup brand is actually
gonna be like the new Kat Von D or
something like that where it really is a
staple they have some great products and
I'm willing to give you know whatever
company whatever brand whatever person
that chance to show their products and
see what they have but anyway this
product isn't really doing it for me but
I'm excited to see what else is in the
collection the items in it range from
like eight dollars up to $49 so this is
the top of the price bracket and I'd
like to see kind of what's in that like
$20 and under range the next item on
this frickin list is something as soon
as I saw pictures up I was so tempted to
freaking preorder this crap I'm talking
about another club
lots of collapse I'm talking about the
smash box in Vlada is how you say it
anyway
they did a collaboration together and I
wanted those freaking rose highlighters
so freakin bad I have not purchased one
at the moment as we speak and I kind of
don't think I will ultimately only
because I don't know if they're gonna be
light enough for my skin tone there's
like the gilded rose or golden rose it's
like a little bit lighter I just don't
know if it's light enough for my skin
tone so that is like the main thing
holding me off of this collection there
are some like liquid lipsticks there's
so much in this collection it's all very
beautiful I feel like it it's themed
very well I think it fits
Vlada very well I think that Smashbox is
really stepping it up with this
collection doing something just Smashbox
but better you know what I mean like
they're doing the primer water but it
has like the rose gold so they're doing
the sable product and doing a twist on
it that really fits the collaboration
well I really like the theme of it I
know that rose gold is like you know
it's been done but I think they still
did it great and I think they did it in
a really like awesome way I think so
many people are like interested in this
collection just from looks alone and I
know packaging isn't everything but I'm
really proud of Smashbox and excited for
Smashbox with this launch and hopefully
going forward they can continue to do
things like this I kind of like push
them a little bit this packaging was
just so much more inspired than other
things I've seen before obviously I'm
mostly talking about the highlighters I
don't think that the eyeshadow palette
is something I'd be at all interested in
I do have the ablaze one and it's okay
but I I don't know I'm just nervous that
the eyeshadows and it wouldn't be as
blinding but I would love to see
people's reviews to see if they actually
are really really good yeah overall I
think it's really cool just nothing
quite fits me but I can respect the
collection in and of itself and I think
it's really awesome next are some
products from melt cosmetics and these
are called blush lights they're kind of
a mixture of a blush and a highlight you
can use them however you want to kind of
give the example that you can use them
as a highlight if you want you can use
them as a blush or you can use them as a
topper there are seven different colors
and what I really like about this
collection and I think that fits melt
brand really well is the fact that
they've done so you know neutral or
normal colors for blushes but they've
also done like I'm
Green and like a purple and you know
they kind of spiced it up which I feel
like is something that they're known for
especially with their lipsticks so I
think this is a great launch for them
I'm so glad to see them expanding I
really wanted to try their products I've
I don't think I've had anything for melt
actually I really want to try their
eyeshadow stacks so I do really like
this I'm interested again to see reviews
don't know if I'd purchase but there's
something that's on my radar again just
because I like something doesn't mean
I'm gonna buy it or just even because
I'm interested in it or I think it's a
great release doesn't mean that it
belongs in my collection but I do think
this is really cool and I'm excited to
see some reviews on it moving on I have
a product from Laura Geller this is a
baked gelato swirl trio of highlighter
so it's $29 you get three different
colors two of them I guess are things
that are already there there's the
diamond dust which is an opal like
flashing pink I think there's like a
violent one that shifts and then I think
it's like a yellow gold so this is like
a I really like the price point of this
product if you're like $30 it's pretty
reasonable I like Laura Geller
I think the gelato swirl highlighters
are some of their best products as in
bestsellers other than you know to a
market other than what they're normally
selling to if that makes sense like the
YouTube market the Instagram market so I
get why they're going this route I don't
know it's just a little too late for me
but I do like the price point and kind
of wanted to bring it up in case you
were wanting to try it this might be a
way you might want to although it's not
like we haven't seen this before man I'm
just like it's like floral inception
over here alright so we're gonna move on
to the balm they are coming out with
some plump your pucker glosses these
retail for $14 which i think is a pretty
good price point there's 18 different
colors and I really liked the color
selection that they had based off the
picture I thought that they looked
really nice so I would be interested to
try these hopefully they're not sticky
but I definitely think that glosses are
making a comeback I've heard so many
people talking about how they like
glosses more they're kind of over liquid
lipstick so I am excited oh so excited
for that because I just I like
comfortable and so some great glosses
could come on the market that would be
absolutely amazing I have two more
things to talk about but these are just
like collections overall and the next
one is from Mac and it's the Matt and
Patrick star floral realness collection
now I wanted to bring this up
no it's not super new compared to all
the other stuff I'm talking about but I
think that Mac did an amazing job of
making this collection affordable I
remember looking at Mac products and
being like $30 for a powder holy crap
and like you know the quad alone would
be definitely in the $30 range as well
and so for them to put out two different
kits for $49 is amazing you get so many
products so for $49 depending on which
kit you get you're gonna get a lipstick
a lip gloss a quad of eyeshadows and a
blush duo I mean it's just a great deal
and I think that they're really pricing
themselves at a very competitive price
and I hope that they continue to do this
going forward I really thought this was
great so it definitely makes me want to
take a second look at Mac and I thought
this collection was really pretty I saw
some different looks and first
impressions and stuff on it and it
really is a beautiful collection it's
not this thing like that's insanely new
but I think that it's a great one for
spring it's a different take on spring
it has some of those purples but also
some of those Indigo's like I do really
like it and I love the name of it floral
realness it also makes sense with my
background and everything too so yeah I
I just really wanted to touch on that
price point because that really is
what's selling me on this collection and
for it to be an influencer collab and it
to be at such a great price range I
really hope that that was Patrick being
like you know fighting for that for his
subscribers and for his fans alright in
the last collection I want to talk about
is actually one from Kiko their new
collection is called golden waves I know
that Kiko is not super available in the
United States as it is like in Europe I
think it's like way more accessible
there but there is a store here in
Hollywood so I think it's becoming more
accessible here and I got this
collection was really pretty the
packaging is all golden there are a ton
of different products in it all of this
stuff I didn't mention is from trend
moods Instagram so I'm gonna leave her
link down below and I always look there
for all my new makeup news I like seeing
all the different pictures they're
posting and all of that so yeah that's
where I saw this but I happen to
actually get products from it to day
it's so weird they actually sent through
some items so if you guys want to see
some reviews on some of those products
definitely let me know down below but
they have some bronzers highlighters
blushes I mean Kiko really goes all out
with their freakin collections a lot of
you guys were telling me in the free
soul video that that they always have
stuff coming out and sometimes that can
be a little bit frustrating because
maybe some of the stuff is in quality so
I'd love to if you want to see a review
from it let me know but I'm excited for
it and I was excited to wear it before I
got it so yeah I'm excited to see how
these things actually hold up they have
a couple liquid eyeshadows in the
collection too which I really like you
guys know like I'm like into the freakin
liquid eyeshadows so I'm excited to try
those out there is like a brush set and
a like makeup bag so I mean it really
has like every like a ton of different
pieces for this collection alright guys
so that's everything for this video let
me know what new launches are really
peaking your interest if there's
anything in this video that you liked or
didn't like for whatever reason I'd love
to know your thoughts in the comments
and other than that I will see you in my
next video thanks so much for watching
