Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another new
Beauty lunches this is a series I
started a while ago where we talk about
new Beauty releases and just kind of let
you guys know my thoughts on it if it's
interesting if it's not just overall
yeah like anything I think about it so
really quick up front I do have a demo
on this look with my lime crime palette
so that is probably up by now so you can
go check that out if you want to know
how I did this eye look and also just in
the future definitely check the
description box to see if I have a
tutorial on the look that I have or if
it's coming up because I do fill most of
the looks that I film in just so you
guys can know how to do them so
definitely check out the description box
in the future to see if a tutorial is
coming or if it's already happened and
you guys can check it out other than
that there is some music going on and
really sorry about that but you know
well get into the new Beauty launches
now I get most of my new Beauty info
from the trend mood Instagram so I'm
gonna leave them linked down below so
you can check out their Instagram or her
Instagram the first collection I want to
talk about though is one I'm super
pumped for and I have it coming to me in
the mail and this is the wet and wild
flights of fancy Summer 2018 collection
I did pick up the entire box which has
quite a bit of items in it but this
collection has lip glosses lips crubs
blushes eye palettes nail polishes
setting sprays and eyeliners in it I
love affordable makeup and I really like
how when Wilde has been doing their
launches lately I love that I can pick
up most of the things for the range for
$34.99 if you want to pick up the box
basically everything or at least one of
everything except for the nail polishes
it's $35 that is less money than like a
high-end palette now I know this is
drugstore quality but I feel like for
the most part what and while performs
man especially for the price so I'm
excited about this collection I really
love that they did some blushes and
didn't just do a bunch of highlighters
didn't just do a bunch of liquid
lipsticks I think that they did a good
job with this I like the color story I
like the inspiration I'm down for it I
really hope that those eyeliners don't
freakin suck that will be tested for
sure and I will be doing a testing
testing one two three on this collection
once I have it in so look forward to
that but this is a collection I'm super
excited about and it's affordable so yes
let me know if you guys are picking that
up in the common
the next item I want to talk about is
something that's very new and like
doesn't have a lot of information out
it's room to face and it's the circa
1998 palette or at least that's what we
can see trend mood has like some light
pictures that look like they were taken
from a snapchat or something like that
it says this pallets coming soon so I
don't have a release date on it but this
looks interesting to me I'm not sure how
I feel it's like some pinky purple
colors coming through quite a bit of
that actually so that seems exciting but
I really need to see like the full
palette layout to see what's going on
from the picture it also looks like
there are some like different finishes
in here like some nice metallics maybe
some glitters and I don't know I just I
need to see some reviews on this because
I feel like two-phase is so hit and miss
like sometimes their mats are awesome
sometimes they suck sometimes their
metallics are amazing and then sometimes
they're pieces of crap so I definitely
want to see some reviews I'm interested
to see what the full palette is gonna
actually look like so I will be
definitely excited to see that come up
in my feet hopefully soon next let's
talk about Mac they are coming out with
a fix plus that is in that finally I
think this is a great expansion on their
fix plus line you guys know that I
freaking love fix+ but it isn't
something that's going to mattify you it
isn't something that's gonna make your
makeup really stay on a lot longer maybe
if you have dry skin but it's more of
this like just beautiful finishing spray
so I think it's really great that they
have a matte spray they're adding to the
line I know they just came out with to
kind of like shimmery glittery fix
pluses and I think those are great and
fun but I think this matte one is really
going to be useful for a lot of people
and something that a lot of people will
get a lot of benefit from if it's good
so hopefully it is and I'm excited for
that and just you know that mac fix+ is
coming out May 31st next on the list is
from Kylie baby we have the bronze
extended palette palette we all wanted
right just kidding I think this is a
beautiful palette when you look at it by
itself without anything else you know
like no other makeup exists on this
planet then it's beautiful for sure I
just think that it's already been done
she's already done this before I get
that it's the extended version of her
bronze palette but
I don't know I I don't I just don't
think it necessarily needed to be done
but um she made it if you're into
bronzes this is like for you it's your
perfect palette it has 12 shades it's
now available I'm not sure what it
retails for but I'm sure it's in like
the 40 50 dollar range
yeah I would not pick that up next let's
talk about Physicians Formula they came
out with some butter beauty kits and
these are so exciting they have two
different shade options so they all come
with a bronzer a blush and those are two
different colors depending on if you get
to like a medium kit or the medium dark
kit and then they have two highlighters
which are the same in both and then the
star of the show the thing that is the
most exciting they have a freaking
fragrance that comes in it like what the
heck I really do like the smell of the
butter bronzer it's like kind of weird
but overall I do like it because it's
coconut and we all know that I freaking
love coconut so I am excited to try this
I watched a review from Bailey B I'm
gonna leave it link down below if you
were interested in this and wanted a
little bit more info she said that the
scent of the perfume she was happy with
it because it wasn't an exact replica of
the powder
it was just like inspired by the powder
so I mean I want it just for that
freaking spray alone like I would I want
just the spray these are gonna retail
for 1495 which i think is an amazing
price if you get the butter bronzer on
its own it's about that price so I don't
know if these are like full sizes or
smaller sizes or whatever but I think
this is a good value it's definitely
something on my radar you guys know I
love the butter bronzer I've been
through like two of them I love it and
that will be releasing sometime in May I
believe you can get it at Walmart or on
the Walmart website or on physician's
formula website as well next let's talk
about who - Beauty she's coming out with
two more of the obsessions palettes
these retail for $27 and I have all the
other ones I have all four of the
originals I do really like them I think
they're nice and love how small they are
I love that they're a better price point
for huda you still get a ton of shadow
and you still get a ton of color options
like their full color stories but when
it comes to these two new ones one is
the gemstone and one is the coral
obsessions I just am not feeling it I
have all the other ones I don't think
these are anything that special out of
the two if you like gemstone is a little
bit more different but it's just not my
color palette
little bit dark and deep for me I'm not
saying that they shouldn't have come out
with these I just they don't grab me I'm
not excited for them I personally just
don't think they're anything that
different so I will not be picking those
ones up number eight we're going back to
Mac we have the Mac summer collection
which is called Mirage noir okay first
off I really like the idea of Mirage
noir I like that it's like kind of this
darker iridescent packaging I don't know
I just I feel the inspiration for it and
then I look at the collection and I'm
just like whatever
what don't like it I don't like the
collection I honestly feel like the
summer collection is like something
that's huge for Mac I remember when the
what is it wash and dry that one had
really beautiful packaging I remember
what the aquatic one it was really
popular there was like this like hey
sailor one like I feel like the summer
collections like a big deal you know and
I just I feel like it could have been
really cool but I just don't like the
actual products in there one of the ones
that really I'm like no is this weird
like blush highlighter bronzer situation
it's all mixed up it's looking crazy
it's looking like a mirage maybe that
was the in spell I just don't like
products like this when it comes to
practicality how do you use this what do
you use it for I'm not saying that you
can't just swirl them all maybe it's a
beautiful color but I just don't I don't
love that they just look basic too it's
like the basic pink and the basic bronze
and the basic highlight just nothing no
nothing different for me they're coming
out with some face and body in this
collection that has like a shimmer to it
so maybe that would be kind of cool and
it has like a brush with it the lip
sticks the lip gloss is just everything
just kind of I don't know I just wasn't
feeling it but I did like the
inspiration so I don't know it happened
for me I'm just not feeling it and the
last thing I want to talk about is from
makeup geek these are the power pigments
they're coming out with ten different
pigments they're super beautiful they're
kind of almost like these traditional
rainbow colors these are going to be
coming out on the 3rd so by the time
this video goes up they will be
available they're gonna retail for nine
dollars which is more expensive for
makeup geek but she said because of the
pigment and the
to pigment in each of these shadows the
price it just had to go up as well as I
think these are a bigger amount of
product than normal that you would get
something to note about these is that
you can use them on the eyes the lips
and the face which i think is really
great because a lot of times when things
are called pigments you can't do that
that's kind of how they get around the
FDA and like you know using red pigments
or not approved pigments around the eye
they can't call it an eye shadow but
these you can use anywhere which i think
is really cool Marlena has a whole video
talking about these so I'll leave that
link down below if you want some
swatches and some info on them something
I don't like about these is that they
change the shape of the pan I don't know
why they decided to do that I love
makeup geek shadows I have quite a few
that I've bought in the past and I like
the traditional circle pan and I hate
that these are now a different shape
than those and like what are you gonna
redo all of the things in your line just
to do it so they all match or are these
just like their own thing let me know
what you guys think about that is that
just me being weird for the aesthetic of
it all but I don't know I just don't
think she needed to necessarily do that
but maybe it has something to do with
this new formula so it doesn't crumble
it just worked better in a square pan I
don't know I don't know why she changed
that overall I think they're really
pretty I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick
any up at the moment but I think it
would be good replacements for anyone
looking for things like then maybe two
local remix or if you like a palette and
you like like one color cuz it just is
punchy and beautiful you could pick up
one of these and just get that
inspiration from that one color without
picking up a whole palette so I think
it's awesome I think it's great for her
range I would love to see some looks
being done which I know she will be
doing so I'm excited to look at those
alright guys and that is everything for
my new makeup lunches let me know what
you guys think in the comments down
below what are some things that are
intriguing you things that you
definitely don't want you know like we
always say there's always new crap
coming out and I really like the way
that this series has kind of evolved for
me it used to be about like I'm gonna
get this or I'm not gonna get this and
now it's more about like let's just
discuss it like even if you like
something doesn't mean you have to put
your money down and get it we can just
you know admire from afar or understand
that that might be great for their line
without needing to have it in our own
personal collections that's something I
feel very strongly about y'all
other than that that's everything thank
you so so much for watching guys and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
