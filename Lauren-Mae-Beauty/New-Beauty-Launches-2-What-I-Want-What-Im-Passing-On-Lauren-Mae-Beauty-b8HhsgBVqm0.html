Lauren today I thought I would do
another new and beauty what I would
purchase and what I want to pass on you
guys really seem to like the first one I
did so I will leave it link down below
if you want to check that out a little
bit about it though I am going to just
be talking about some new products that
are out on the market in the beauty
world and let you guys know what I think
about them whether I'm wanting to
purchase them whether I don't want to
purchase them and just the reasons why
everyone has a different reason for
wanting something or not so if I don't
want something and you do want it that
doesn't mean that it's bad or I'm trying
to be like mean to you these are just my
thoughts and how this makeup would work
in my collection or in my kit I am a
makeup artist that being said again I
don't have any of these products so I've
never liked swatch them or tested them
these are just my thoughts on seeing
swatches online seeing people haul them
seeing them online at Sephora and Ulta
so I picked out 10 items and let me know
if there's anything down below you want
me to talk about that I haven't talked
about in this video or the previous one
there's always just so many new releases
so it's hard to like stay up on it but I
did check Ulta site this time too and
not just for us so hopefully they'll be
a little bit of a better mix between not
just like safor exclusive stuff okay
let's get into the first item the first
item I want to talk about is the
Smashbox light it up LA lights palette
and this is a contour highlight and
blush palette it has nine different face
products in it and it retails for $39
I'm really interested in this palette
I'm not sure if I'm gonna buy it but I
do think that it seems interesting
I love the Smashbox 3 pan contour
palette I absolutely just adore it I
think it's really well done I think the
products you're really good quality I've
almost finished mine up entirely so I am
intrigued because of how much I liked
that into this palette as well as the
fact that obviously I could use it in my
kit and it'd be really nice
I also saw someone swatch this and I
thought it just looked really nice so it
is something I'm looking at I also get a
discount on it so to me that makes it a
lot more worth it to I definitely think
for anyone who has like a freelance kit
it'd be really awesome or for anyone
who's just trying to expand their blush
collection or hasn't tried anything from
Smashbox it might be a good idea
although it is nine products in one
palette so it is a lot one of the things
that also
like about this is the price I think $39
is a really fair price for how much
product you're getting and how many
different shades number two let's talk
about Urban Decay illuminated trio naked
illuminated trio there are so many
highlighting palettes on the market and
you know I just I'm not really as into
highlighting as I feel like anyone
else's I know love Heatherette also is
just kind of like not down with the
highlighter as much something I dislike
them it's just like I just don't really
like the metallic look I don't anyway
going back to the urban decay one though
this is a palette that cost $36 it has
three different shades in it I'm just
not really into the highlighting
palettes per se I do like the Anasazi a
cloak it's the that glow and the gleam
ones I think those are really nice but I
feel like if you have those you really
just don't need like how many shades of
highlighter can you really use on one
skin tone so unless you have a kid again
I just don't see the point I also don't
know how I feel about the formula again
I haven't watched and I haven't like
seen it in person but I know that their
other highlighters are super glittery so
I have a feeling that with it being
Urban Decay and their other highlighters
that these are also going to be quite
glittery so that is something I would
definitely pass on I don't know I'm just
like I'm just into the highlighting
palettes number three is the Tarte tar
deist hardest and I say that like I've
heard so many people say it differently
but the Tarte artists paint palette set
is retails for $49 it has 24 eyeshadows
three face products a mini mascara a lip
paint and a brush here's my issue with
chart I think that's a fair price for
how much product you're getting $50 is
like a decent gift for let's say someone
you really like like I don't know to me
$50 is like what we spend on our parents
so like if my mom really wanted that or
maybe you'd spend on your children like
oh my child really wants this it's like
a good price I think it's a good price
for how much you're getting to sum it up
but I don't think that tart has had
really good quality palettes especially
when it comes to holiday palettes in the
past so it's kind of like
yeah you're getting a lot but are you
getting a lot of just craps so I would
definitely swatch that palette out I
also think it's a little gimmicky having
like the paint set separate and all of
that like I just think of it as like
really bulky packaging and stuff but I
can see the desire to want to get it
just because of I think I don't know I
just think that's a good price point
like I think that fifty dollars for
twenty four shadows alone would be good
and then you get all the other stuff so
let's just move on I feel like everyone
kinda already knows how they feel about
that palette anyway number four let's
talk about stealers liquid lipsticks
sets they have three different ones
going on they have two trios ones like a
nude one ones a bright one and it comes
with three minis and they retail for
twenty dollars and then they have a
bigger one has five minis and a glitter
top coat and that retails for $39 I
think this is a really good set I look
at everything kind of before my kit as
well especially when it comes to lip
products I love that they're minis
because you aren't going to go through a
full-sized liquid lipstick especially if
you're like a collector and you get a
lot of makeup like you're probably never
gonna finish up a full-sized liquid
lipstick so minis to me are like the
perfect way to try out a bunch of
different colors try out the formula see
if you like it and get your money's
worth you're spending what you would for
one color in three different colors so I
absolutely love that I want to get the
nude one for sure but I might just get
the big one with the five of them and
then has that glitter top coat because I
think I'd be really cool to have in my
kit too and I think that they're just a
fair price I just think you'll get your
money's worth out of that out of three
of them especially if you get the set
that just pertains to what you like to
wear the most so I really just like
those sets and I'm excited to try this
out I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get them
because I do get a discount on that on
top of it so I'm sorry to forget me
discount all the time but that's just
again like when I'm telling you how I
think of things that's how I think of it
but I think just like for anyone that is
a good deal three minis for twenty the
sixth item on this list are the NYX huge
sets now I think it's exciting that NYX
and a drugstore brand are doing like big
blockbuster types of sets I think that's
really cool a part of me really likes
that and thinks it's awesome because
it's something different that we really
haven't seen before
that being said
I think it's like psychotic at the same
time no hate to anyone who wants to get
this set I get it if you're a collector
or something but I can't imagine having
the soft matte lip cream set which has
36 pieces in it it retails for $65 you
just don't need them so many I can't
imagine having that many in my kit of
just one brand I just don't feel like
any brands range is that good where you
should have like every single one I
don't think that's very often and I
don't feel like it's that way with NYX
so I just feel like even if you want 10
of them go buy 10 shades and then save
the rest your money or buy something
else or if you're gonna spend $65 like
go treat yourself to something really
nice I just think it's a lot of money
although you are getting a lot of stuff
I just don't think that there's no way
you could use all this up before they go
bad and there's no way that all those
lipsticks are gonna look good on the one
person I don't know maybe if you had a
kit I can maybe see it but even then I
just like to diversify my stuff I don't
like to just have one brand I like to
have a bunch of different things so
there's that one there's a liquid suede
set that has 24 shades for $49.99 and
then there's a NYX loves la library set
which has 12 like single shadows
packaging super cute Eveline a while
actually did a like review on it I'll
leave her video link down below and I
kind of just feel how she feels it's
like I would rather just been a pallet
than singles I think the packaging is a
super cute idea but you're actually
using it it's just not doesn't work so
yeah I'm gonna pass on all of those
number seven is a makeup geek and they
came out with their highlighter palette
this is a kathleenlights like collab I
think these are really pretty but I do
feel like they're just so metallic I
heard that they are the same formula as
their foiled eyeshadows and I'm just
personally not as into that type of
highlight I really like a more natural
Sheen to the skin so I'm just not into
something that metallic and it's $39
which i think is a decent price you are
getting a lot of product but I prefer
getting less product and it being
cheaper than getting like a huge pan and
then charging you more because realist
you're just not gonna go through it and
you're gonna want the next thing so I'd
rather save money have less product and
use it and enjoy it if I really like it
and like say use it up I can repurchase
it or I can just move on to something
new so yeah sadly I love makeup geek so
much but I don't think I'm gonna get
those I don't think I'm gonna get any of
the do Chrome once either I just feel
like you can just use shadows as
highlighters for duochrome just kind of
like over the highlighters guys okay um
let's move on number eight this is the
morphe and kathleenlights palette
kathleenlights just collapse with
everyone her clubs are always super
popular and this is one I have no more
fish a doze I've heard people love them
people hate on blah blah blah you have
to be literally living under a rock like
literally under a rock to not have heard
of morphe shadows or an affiliate link
with morphe but this is a palette i
actually was interested in trying it
sold out so don't even try to go get it
I don't know if it's gonna come back in
stock but it's 15 shades for $14.99 I
really enjoyed that she did a
collaboration that was it was affordable
and so to me I can forgive it not being
obviously the highest quality because
it's not from a high-end company this is
something that is more affordable and I
really like the color selection it did
kind of remind me of the Jaclyn hill
palette like favorites palette with
morphine but I'm actually interested in
it so if it comes back in stock and I
happen to be buy a computer
I might purchase it just because I I
don't know 15 dollars I'm okay with kind
of risking it on a collab and seeing how
the shadows perform I just don't feel
like for spending $15 on something that
isn't supposed to be like the best
quality ever I just don't feel like I'm
gonna be disappointed with that collab
and that's something that sounds so
refreshing compared to I feel like some
of the club's that have been happening
and in the recent past in the recent
past that haven't happened recently so
my curiosity is piqued on that number
nine is the Urban Decay full spectrum
palette I was really excited about this
palette when I first saw it and the more
I see swatches of it the more I just
don't feel like the pigmentation is
there it looks a little patchy to me I
don't know I don't think I'm gonna get
it I think I'm just gonna stick with my
Kat Von D me vida loca remix palette I
don't think that I'll get the use out of
it that I think I will I don't know I
just it's just not something that wowed
me as much
it had the time to kind of see you
swatches see reviews and let my hype in
my own head die down before just like
released something I wanted to mention
to Stephanie the day's eagerly here I'll
leave her Instagram link down below as
well as her channel but she mentioned on
her Instagram she took a picture and the
white shade in this palette is called
bump which is a reference to cocaine
like you take a bump of cocaine and you
know that was really upsetting for her
and she just voice that in a post and it
just got me thinking like so many of
these brands do have very provocative
names and we've almost come to expect it
but when you really look at it and who
these pallets are being sold to and all
that I don't know it just definitely
it's lately think about it and I'm not
saying I wouldn't buy the palette
because of that it just made me kind of
like take a double like look and like a
think a double think on it and just like
the fact that like why do these
companies do that obviously everyone can
do what they want and be provocative and
be out there whatever but I just thought
it was an interesting point and
something that just made me stop and
think so anyway I thought I'd mention
that and last let's talk about the last
thing here another highlighter palette
and this is the Anasazi a Beverly Hills
ultimate Glo kit palette it's the one
with the six shades that all look
exactly the same I hate to be a hater
I love the Anasazi blow kits again the
gleam and that glow are some of my
favorite ones but I just don't I don't
understand how these girls have this
many highlighters I don't I don't
understand it and again I'm just done
I'm gonna do a video I think I'm like
the trends I want to just not die
because I'm not trying to be a hater I
just I'm just kind of over it's just
like I'm ready for something new I'm
ready for something that's actually new
and exciting but anyway to me when I've
seen these swatch they look so similar
honestly so similar guys and I just
can't imagine having six more pans of
the same highlighters oh and I feel like
the other kids have those bases covered
if those are the same formula though as
the original glow kits I do think that
they're really good formulas so if you
don't have any of those they'll probably
perform really nice and look really
beautiful for me even in my kit it's
just too much I have
already have enough and honestly for
camera and stuff I don't even use
highlighters like there's no way I'm
just gonna pack on the highlighter on
someone's cheekbone it would look
horrible it would look like
tinman or really sweaty like it just
wouldn't look good so anyway those are
my thoughts and some new products in the
beauty community again don't be offended
by anything I said please just take it
as it is these are just my opinions
these are how I feel like they've work
in my collection and everyone's
collections and needs for makeup are
different so you do your thing girl I'm
even mad
that's everything guys I hope you
enjoyed and I will see you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
