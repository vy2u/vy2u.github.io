Lauren this is going to be my new and
beauty what I want what I don't want
this is kind of my take on an anti haul
but instead of just talking about the
things I don't want to purchase I just
talk about new items that are coming up
basically everything I picked out was
from my Instagram feed I feel like there
are so many new products launching I
mean there's always new products
launching but they're quite a few and
there are some that I'm really
interested in some that I'm not and I
like to use these videos just as a
discussion I not only am a beauty lover
but I am a pro makeup artist so I just
like to give my take on what I think
about the new products coming out
whether I want to buy them whether I
don't want to buy them and I think it's
fun to just have a healthy dialogue in
the comments down below
obviously I don't own any of this stuff
because a lot of it's not even out yet
there's just a lot I feel like there's a
lot in this video so hold on tight and
let's talk about some stuff the first
brand I want to talk about is lorac I
feel like I have seen so much new lorac
stuff and that makes me so excited
they're one of my favorite brands I
absolutely love their eyeshadow
formulation I think it's really great
and I'm kind of just a sucker so oh the
first thing I want to talk about is the
pirate's collection I believe I saw this
for the first time on Super Bowl I don't
know if that's when the picture came out
or whatever but I remember Super Bowl
Sunday looking through my feet and
seeing this like pirates collection with
lorac from my knowledge I do not think
that there is a picture of the inside
yet but I'm super intrigued I cannot
wait to see what's inside that palette I
am definitely interested if there's more
information by the time I edit this and
put it out I will try to leave like
prices and things on the side here but
I'm definitely interested in that
palette I just want to see what the
inside is and we can go from there I
just I love lorac and I love
collaborations I think collaborations
that are inspired by movies or people I
think are just fun there's inspiration
behind it and I just really like that I
think that there's more to go off of and
I'm more interested in that than if it's
just like here's a new neutral palette
you know so we'll see what that looks
like inside
I'm excited the next few products from
lorac are part of their spring 2017
collection which i believe is something
about brunching it's like I know it's
not bitches who brunch but it's like
something about
Jeng maybe I saw a hashtag about that I
don't know that comes to mind but anyway
it has a pastel palette which spoiler
I've already bought I was really excited
I had a gift card from Christmas so I
just like went for it so hopefully
that's actually good if not I will be
returning it I'm a little nervous about
pigmentation on that one
but it also has I believe three
highlighters ones like a mint color like
a pastel pink and a pastel purple and
then some lip glosses I think it's just
a fun collection I'm really excited for
it again I might be biased because it's
lorac but I just thought it was
something interesting a little bit
different not like insane but just
something new and exciting so I thought
that was a really cool collection that
they came out with obviously I bought
one in the palette so I will have a
video on that once I get it in the mail
and then the last two things I want to
talk about from lorac I believe came out
at the same time as well it's part of
their like California collection there
was a palette called the California
Dreaming palette and I don't know if
it's because I live in California again
I like lorac but I was definitely
interested in this palette the colors to
me aren't the most different but I do
love Laura I love the packaging on it I
was definitely interested in trying to
get it especially if I can get my pro
discount on it it's something that I
would look into even more I just thought
it was pretty I thought it was different
I feel like it slid under the radar I
didn't hear like anyone talking about it
I know Stephanie from the daisy girlie
definitely did buy it she posted a
picture on her Instagram so I will link
that down below if you want to go check
that out she said she really liked it so
that gives me hope that it's really nice
so I do want to like try that out I
think that I would be tempted to buy it
if I got my discount on it and with that
same collection came a blush palette and
again I just thought that this had
really nice colors there's four
different shades nothing too bright
nothing too crazy I've mentioned before
in my videos that I like blushes that
are just easy to put on easy to like
deal with I don't like something super
pigmented and when it comes to blush I
just I don't know I don't have time to
make a huge mistake like that on my face
in the morning but I really like that
palette again if I get my discount on it
I'm probably gonna buy it I just think
that they picked some really nice colors
I do believe one's a highlighter and
maybe one's a potential bronzer but yeah
I'm interested in that too
lots of great things from Laura I was
just excited to see some new stuff from
them and hopefully if a pirate's
collection is cool like it's like a
homerun for me on those ones so let me
know what you thought of some of the
lorac stuff that's coming out next let's
talk about some to face stuff they're
always coming out with new stuff let's
be honest but they have a few new things
that are about to drop and I feel like I
have some opinions
first let's talk about the honey palette
now in a past video i dissed the honey
palette let's first say that I love the
PB and J pallet I think it's super
pretty I love the colors and I'm really
down with that palette so when I saw
just the sneak peek of the tin of the
honey palette I was excited I couldn't
wait to see what was inside and when I
got the view of the inside I was just
like then and then oh honey I didn't
really like it now upon second glance I
will say I don't hate it as much as I
originally didn't spend my thoughts
aren't as strong on it in that way but
I'm still not a hundred percent down
with it I really like that yellow shade
but I feel like chickadee or paper tiger
from colour-pop could work really
similarly I also have some Coastal
Scents shadows that I feel like would
work really well to mimic that one color
and I don't feel like the rest of the
palette kind of deserves to be bought
because of the other shades so I might
do a video like duping it obviously from
just like what I think would match
really well let me know if you'd want to
see something like that if you were
interested I think I'm gonna have to
pass on it it's gonna be hard but I'd
rather get this stuff from lorac like in
my head I'm like I'd way rather get the
stuff from lorac then that palette so I
think that's something I'm definitely
gonna pass on let me know what you
thought down below though okay now this
next palette I'm for sure like I'm just
done I'm like really really they're
coming out with a palette called the
natural love palette I think I have my
notes here oh my goodness it looks like
first off it looks like the viola boss
palette with the squares and everything
and I think this palette looks so boring
it looks so boring there's like one pink
in it and other than that they're like
cool toned neutral toned Browns my
goodness if we don't have already
700 of those I mean I appreciate the
size is it's a bit different for to face
and configuration of the shadows but
color wise it's just the most boring
basic palette ever if you're gonna buy
something for someone who like has no
makeup sure it'd be great or if you have
like only a colorful palette it should
be awesome assuming the quality is good
but for all of us on YouTube and
Instagram who are obsessed with makeup
it's like I'm like offended
but you think I want that look I don't
want it yeah so that was disappointing I
wish it was better I wish it was just
better but it's it's not it's not gonna
be good I don't suggest anyone who is on
YouTube to get it because you already
have it you just already have that crap
and moving on to the last thing I want
to talk about from Too Faced let's talk
about those highlighters the packaging
is absolutely beautiful it looks like a
heart-shaped diamond and they're
metallic I believe there are three
different shades and they aren't gonna
retail for $30 each it's pretty pricey
but that's kind of like normal pricing
for Too Faced and just high-end brands
I'm interested to try these and just
swatch them I'm not super big on
highlighters I have a ton of
highlighters especially for how much I
feel like I love highlighters but I mean
I'm definitely intrigued I can
definitely see why people would want to
get it there's gonna be a gold one which
I think will be nice for darker or
warmer skin tones there's gonna be a
pearl and then I think there's like a
pinky one so I think that it's nice I
think it's a good addition to their
range because they really don't have any
highlighters right now I can see why
people will want them but I think I
probably will pass on him next let's
talk about some Anastacio stuff I was
really excited to see that she is
collabing with Nicole Guerrero
she's like an OG youtuber I don't
believe that the inside of this palette
has been released yet but I'm super
excited to see what it looks like the
packaging looks really pretty I'm
personally a really big fan of the
honest hacia highlighters in the palette
I have the gleam that glow moonchild and
the sweets one I don't have the Sun
dipped one and I don't have the limited
edition one for holiday which I heard
sucked but for the original quality I
think that they're really great I think
they're buildable you can do something
more sheer and a little bit more natural
or really build it up I just
they're really nice so I'm just
interested I'm excited to see the inside
I think that's an awesome opportunity
for Nicole so I'm interested we'll see
what it looks like inside do I need it
definitely not do you guys need it
probably not but um I think it's like a
fun collab so I'm excited and then the
other product which isn't that new I
feel like I made a list before I film
this video and it just took me a while
to like get to filming and I had to make
a new list because there's already that
many new products that drop but I wanted
to talk about the lip palette I think
the lip palette is really cool I've
heard great things about the formula it
looks super pigmented I've seen so many
lip swatch videos using that palette I
definitely think for a makeup artist
it's a really nice just all-in-one kit
it's $40 which i think is really
reasonably priced and if you're a makeup
artist you can get a discount on that if
you go to like meme's or wherever
anasazi is sold so I think it is a nice
palette I think also for people who love
makeup it's kind of like a fun new thing
I really like that they included the
primary colors at the bottom the white
and the black so you really can make
just like any shade you want to I think
it was really well thought out I'm
really glad that the formulas good I do
think that if you were using this on set
there are definitely going to be colors
that you're gonna use more than other
colors especially if you're not doing
editorial stuff if you're doing
editorial stuff you probably use the
palette you know pretty equally overall
but for everyday type of clients whether
they're getting ready for events or
wedding or interviews or whatever you do
I definitely think that the nude colors
are gonna go faster I hope they come out
with refill pants essentially as what
I'm saying here but I do think it was a
really cool release okay so most of the
stuff I talk about in this series are
high-end products I just feel like they
take more consideration because they're
more expensive you're working way more
hours to get one product than if you
were going to the drugstore but I wanted
to mention this L'Oreal is coming out
with the Beauty and the Beast like whole
collection set I believe it's like a
lipstick and a nail polish for most of
the main characters it looks so pretty
and so cute I'm not even that into
Beauty and the Beast but I might pick up
one of those lipsticks I think the
packaging looks so cute I just think
it's fun that a drugstore brand is doing
something so big it's
just elf doing something Disney so I am
excited for that I heard that you can
only get them like on Amazon Italy I
don't even know if that's true it was
just like some little blurb I read so
I'm not gonna like stay up and trying to
find it but if I was in store and I saw
the display I would probably definitely
pick one up you know what I'm saying I
think for collectors they'll really love
it and I was really surprised on how
well thought-out everything looked and
it just was really appealing so I
thought it was a really cool collection
if you like everything in here is kind
of positive which you know it doesn't
always happen next I wanted to talk
about Jeffrey Starr's new release
regardless of if you like Jeffrey star
or not I just wanted to talk about the
palette in general and the colors and
I've never bought anything from Jeffrey
star and I probably won't I don't know I
don't like liquid lipsticks very much so
and I don't want to like highlighters so
you know the products are just not that
appealing to me but I was really
surprised by what the androgyny palette
looked like it has 10 shades they're all
very deep and dark I like that a lot of
them are matte I'll say that but I got
kind of like the Urban Decay after after
dark palette I think is what it's called
I got those kind of vibes from it that
palettes like all shimmery so I feel
like this is almost like the matte
counterpart to it I could see why some
people would really like it for me it's
not like a must-have it's not a
game-changer yeah I'll probably just
continue to pass on his stuff but I
thought that the color combination was
definitely interesting and I thought it
looked nice together I wanted to mention
the kylie diary kit I've never bought
anything from Kylie cosmetics again kind
of like Jeffrey star I just feel like I
probably won't ever buy anything liquid
lipsticks are the big deal with her and
I'm not really into liquid lipsticks
also I feel like the eyeshadow palettes
have got reviews across the board that
it's not worth the price and making sure
you're on the site when it restocks and
all that crap besides that I feel like
all the pictures I've seen of her stuff
they still look pretty the palettes look
pretty the liquid lipstick colors look
very on-trend and nice so you know I
could see why people like it this Kylie
diary bullcrap that came out for
Valentine's Day which
filming on Valentine's Day today so
happy Valentine's Day everyone anyway
that looked horrible
it looked so cheap I do not know what
they were thinking I didn't like the
print on the blushes I didn't even like
the color of the blushes the eyeshadow
choices were kind of strange I did see
an eye look that nikkietutorials did
with that palette and it was really
pretty but overall I was just so
underwhelmed and so just like shocked by
the fact that it looked so cheap I feel
like usually her stuff looks really
trendy and nice but this one I was
definitely not digging I feel like it
probably didn't do as well I didn't
really hear much about it so no I was
not feeling that at all I want to talk
about sugar pill I know they're a little
bit more indie and not as well known but
they came out with a palette for
Valentine's Day as well and also a
liquid lipstick it had four shades in it
and I thought it was really interesting
it was kind of pricey but I feel like
it's worth it to support a brand that
puts out consistently good products and
also that's independent you know they're
doing it on their own so the artwork on
it was kind of cute with a little cat
and you know that was like a drawing
that a me I think that's her name
nose maid so I thought that was kind of
cool overall that I thought that the
colors are really pretty I like that
they all went together I do think I
could definitely dupe that in my own
collection so I'm probably not gonna
purchase it but it definitely was
tempting like if I just had all the
money in the world and whatever maybe I
would buy it so I thought that was
really cute the liquid lipstick
personally I'm not really into because
again I don't like liquid lipsticks but
I did think the color is pretty it was
like this metallo sized pearlized red
color really cute for Valentine's Day
and I just thought that was like a cute
little collection I wasn't expecting to
see in my feed the last thing I have to
talk about here is the dubious place
saharan siharan saharan palette siharan
palette I don't know why I don't know
how to say that I probably should I am
interested in this pallid mostly because
the price point is so good I appreciate
the fact that this palette is not $50 I
believe it's in like the $29 range or
mid 20s these shadows artists because
some of the previous palettes that
Julia's places come out with but I did
like the color combination I feel like
I'm really just gravitated to that
really like electric coral color in it
and I probably could do pit but I
definitely can understand why some
people would like this palette there's
just something about a price point being
a little bit cheaper that it just makes
it more worth it when you have so much
makeup and brands are putting out stuff
that you have a million things like it
and you're still paying like fifty sixty
dollars for it it's just too much I can
just appreciate that the price is lower
on pallets and it makes me just a little
bit more like willing to buy it and I
will say I do like stuff that's
configured in a more interesting way
that looks inspired even if I have
colors like it if the whole palette
inspires me I think that there's value
in that so anyway that's everything for
this video let me know in the comments
what you think about some of these new
releases if there's any products you
want me to mention next time I'm gonna
try to film these like once a month
hopefully because there's just so many
products like I need to keep up with it
I think that's everything guys I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
