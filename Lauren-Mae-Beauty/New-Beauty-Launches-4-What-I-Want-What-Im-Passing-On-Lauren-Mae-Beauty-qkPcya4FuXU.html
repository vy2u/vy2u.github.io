Lauren this is going to be another new
beauty launches video a lot of you guys
really liked that video and I do kind of
want to make it a little bit more common
since I swear to you there's way too
much crap dropping all the time I just
went through my Instagram feed again for
this video because I wasn't expecting to
film today but for my next couple of
videos I am gonna check out other sites
to show you guys what's coming out what
my thoughts are about it if you guys
haven't seen a video like this before
this is where I talk about new products
that are launching and it's kind of like
a mix between an anti haul and a fake
like like a wish list essentially I
don't know I just tell you how I feel
about it I'm a makeup artist and a
makeup lover and these are just my
thoughts and my unique perspective on
products that are launching and how I
think they'll be useful or not or just
whatever I really feel about it but yeah
let's just get into it I swear in this
video it's all about the highlight
that's like basically everything I'm
gonna talk about it just keeps coming
guys the highlighters keep coming I
don't understand like hasn't every brand
released a highlighters already like I
don't understand I don't understand why
let's dive into the many different
highlighters that you can purchase
recently first let's talk about the
Becca prismatic amethyst highlighter now
I hope this is a little bit more
exciting than the other highlighters on
this list because it's Becca and they
have tons of really great highlighters
I'm more intrigued by this highlighter
it is one of those kind of like
duochrome which is very popular right
now I already own the moonchild palette
and the kat von d palette so I really
don't need this I probably won't
purchase it but I do think it's an
interesting concept I'm excited to see
kind of Becca's take on it I know that
LS here on YouTube did purchase it so if
you guys want to like check out her
Instagram or follow her on her channel
I'm interested to see her update and how
she likes it but yeah I don't think it's
like a bad product I'm excited to see
their take on the kind of like duochrome
highlighter + the packaging is
absolutely stunning so I'm into it I'm
not gonna buy it probably but I think
it's a cool release next we have
highlighters Kylie cosmetics is coming
out with
Leiter's it was only a matter of time
I'm surprised it took this long I
believe there are five shades the
embossing on the powder has like drips
on it
pardon me likes it part of me doesn't
think it translates well I don't know if
that's just me like something about it
looks a little off I like the idea of
incorporating the drips I just don't
know if it read well for me I think the
color range on the five different
highlighters is nice I think there's
kind of a shade at least for everyone
the only like negative thing besides the
fact that it's highlighters and as you
guys now I'm not like highlighter
obsessed like everyone else
the only thing when I looked at it was
that the packaging looked a little cheap
I like cardboard packaging I think that
it's nice I think especially for like
big eyeshadow palettes or just larger
palettes in general I think it's
inexpensive its slim and keeps
everything just really streamlined so
I'm okay with sturdy cardboard packaging
but for whatever reason I don't know if
it's just the fact that these look kind
of like patent or like glossy cardboard
I just looked a little cheap to me I
kind of want her to like step up her
game and do maybe some actual compacts
something a little bit more sturdy I
think that'd be a really awesome
addition to her packaging and I think it
would just make it look more luxe and
feel more luxe especially because it is
a luxe product it's an expensive product
and I think that it would just it would
look great with her branding and
everything so I really wish it wasn't in
cardboard packaging I guess like it
kinda reminds me of like the whole issue
with the Charlotte Tilbury one that's in
cardboard packaging like it feels like
that type of situation to me next I want
to talk about some violet Voss releases
they're releasing two new things coming
up I have all the dates if I can find
them down below as well as links to
products if they're out so it just for
your guys's convenience if there's
something that I'm talking about and you
decide you want to like check it out
further anyway um first we'll talk about
the highlighter palette because that's
what we're here today to do is talk
about all the freaking highlighters they
are releasing a highlighter palette now
they did already have a highlighter
palette that had three shades in it but
this one has six the picture I saw of
the highlighters color wise I think they
look really pretty like it's a really
pretty palette but I do have some
reservations because I know a lot of
influencers it didn't really like the
original palette they said it's like
powdery a little bit chunky
and I'm just wondering if they change
their formula for this new palette also
based on the picture it kind of looks a
little chunky it looks a little gritty
doesn't look like a really smooth
texture which could be the fact that the
highlighter is like reflecting off the
light of the picture so you know that
doesn't mean anything I'm just telling
you how I feel based off the one picture
I saw colors look really nice hopefully
it's good but I feel like this is very
similar to the Nicole Guerrero palette
released by honest Asya so if I had to
pick one I'd probably pick the Anastasio
one just because I know I really like
their formula so I just felt like those
are really comparable they're both six
shades I feel like they have that like
pinky peachy tone kind of going on so
for me out of the two I would definitely
steer toward be honest I'll see one but
let me know II think down below and the
other item by violet vos is the writer
dye palette now I do believe at IMATS
they were selling this palette because I
I felt like this was already out but it
must have only been being released at
IMATS like early this is a super massive
palette by violet Voss and okay the
reason I'm not feeling it I feel like it
has a lot of the shades from their other
palettes just all put into this big one
so I feel like if you like violet Voss
you probably already have a lot of
what's in this palette if you own the
Holy Grail palette the drench metals
palette or the Laura Lee palette now I
actually do own the Holy Grail palette
when I was working at my mattes I got
gratis at my booth and they had that
palette so I chose that as part of my
gratis I personally really liked the
shadow formulation I was a little bit
nervous that it wasn't gonna be good but
after watching it and I've used it quite
a bit
I feel like the quality for the price is
pretty good like I know there's kind of
this like mix of feelings on it for me
I liked the quality I did not like the
quality of the metal matte palette when
I was watching it so if this has the
quality of the Holy Grail palette I
think quality wise I think it would be
good the other issue I kind of have with
it is just that it doesn't look inspired
to me it literally looks like they just
threw a bunch of shadows into a palette
like trendy shadows like oh here's some
Reds here's some yellows I'll put some
neutrals in it and I just wish it had
more of a theme I've talked about that
in my last video but for me a theme is
what sells a palette for me take me
there take me to the Trop
take me to ancient Egypt like I don't
know what is your theme what's your
concept what's your what's making you
create this what's inspiring you and I
am down to get on board with something
that is just new a new combination of
colors I mean there are only so many
colors in the world right so we're bound
to have similarities but I feel like
inspiration and ideas and the creative
aspect behind palettes is what can make
something different and for me when I
see stuff in my feet or you know online
or whatever is what sells the palette
for me and I just don't feel like this
has it doesn't have that behind it that
what the theme is right or die we
already have a writer guy shadow to me
writer diamonds everyday basics and I
feel like we already have those so I
really wish that they just had more of a
unique concept behind it and didn't just
throw like everything in the kitchen
sink in that palette I feel like it
almost cheapens it like it's okay to
have less and just be more selective
that makes sense if I'm being completely
honest sometimes when I look at it it
kind of just looks like one of those
like 88 palettes from Coastal Scents or
whatever like it just has so many
different shades and the variations of
the shades are so subtle that it just
kind of reminded me about a little bit
and I don't know I just think that's a
little unfortunate I wish it was just
something else moving on I'll talk about
the couple things that aren't
highlighters or safe space now
actually I'll spaced it out so it's like
highlighter highlighter something new
finally highlighter highlighter or
whatever next let's talk about Estee
Lauder heat wave now this highlighter is
too dark for my skin tone I already know
that it would be maybe if I got like
hella tan the summer it would work but
other than that it's not gonna work on
my skin tone but this is beautiful the
swatches look amazing the packaging
looks amazing the embossing is amazing I
guess this is probably my favorite
product like this is my wishlist item
out of these products I feel like if you
have a medium skin tone or even like a
light medium to darker skin tone I think
this highlight would be absolutely
gorgeous on you I think it's one that
you'll actually really like I think the
packaging is nice I think it's one
that's kind of worth splurging on it
doesn't look like a
any glitter in it it just looks
beautiful and I did see some swatches
compared to the old heatwave and this is
definitely a bit more metallic it just
seems like it'll reflect better I just
think that this one is really pretty and
I don't know I feel like it's just a
homerun in so many ways for me I think
this is just a beautiful one and if I
had the right skin tone it would
definitely be probably the most tempting
on this whole list next let's talk about
color pop they're coming out with trios
of their highlighters I don't believe
okay correct me if I'm wrong I might be
wrong I don't think that any of the
highlighters in these trios are new I
think they're just like putting them in
a trio I feel like they've all been
released before whether it they're
permanent or limited-edition or whatever
they do they're putting three of their
highlighters in their normal formula not
a pressed formula in two trios for $22
there's three different ones I'm not
gonna buy them I feel like most people
don't gravitate to cream product I'm
excited to see them really some powder
products I feel like that would have
been a better release for them at the
moment and maybe just I just feel like
they constantly are coming out with new
stuff but it's really just repackaging
the stuff that they have which just gets
tiresome because it just feels like
there's constantly something new all the
time but there's really not
I just don't think excess in releasing
stuff is always the best marketing
strategy coming out with thoughtful
quality products you know as often as
you can
but that you know you don't need to just
have a new thing every week to have a
new thing every week I'm not gonna buy
those I'm not tempted by those at all I
really want to see them come out with
some pressed powder or highlights and I
feel like that would be just more
exciting it would be way more exciting I
know they do have like a contour
highlighter duo with some type of
collaboration thing going on but
individuals or even like a trio exactly
like that but pressed powder would have
been more exciting to me next we have a
release that is going to be coming from
storybook cosmetics I believe they got
their start with their like wizard wand
brushes so their brushes but the you
know base of them looks like they want
they're coming out with a Witchcraft and
Wizardry palette which I believe is
based off of Harry Potter kind of like
the brushes I saw a peek of the palette
and I think the colors look really
pretty obviously I have no idea what
pigmentation is I haven't seen any
swatches of
the eyeshadows and I haven't had any
experience personally with any other
shadows if they have other shadows so I
don't know about quality but if quality
is good it looks like a well-thought-out
palette I don't think that it's anything
insanely new color wise there's some
pretty jewel tone colors in there I
almost feel like this would have been a
better release for like fall/winter so
if they timed it out better I feel like
they could have had a bigger market
because those shadows would be more
appealing than coming out with it like
spring and summer I don't know exactly
when it's released actually let me see
if we have a date on it cuz maybe it's
not coming out for a while
pre-sale is February 24th so I just feel
like that would have helped them a lot
more overall though I don't think
there's anything bad I think this is
definitely more of a palette for
collectors so like if you love Harry
Potter and makeup this is obviously
gonna be an easy sell for you but for
anyone who's actually going into it
wanting the colors you probably could
dupes tough there was this really pretty
like ruby shade but those are more
popular now so I don't think it'd be
impossible to find back to highlighters
we can't stray too far from them guys
Laura Mercier came out with a palette
and this is there I think another
prismatic glow prismatic is the name is
the trendy name now when they were
teasing just the outside and didn't show
the inside yet I was definitely like oh
I want to see what's in there but once I
did I just I'm not very impressed I
don't know I I think they're
highlighters that have that really cool
embossing I have one of them in like in
decent I think they also came out with a
limited edition palette this last
holiday with all four of the shades
those ones just seemed so pretty and are
some nice so I don't know why they felt
the need to come out with this palette I
don't know I just don't feel like these
will match up to it so I'm just not
feeling it I don't think it'll be worth
it I think most people should skip it
just by looking at it it doesn't seem
like anything special I feel like there
are better palettes coming out at the
same time that this one's kind of gonna
get lost to more kind of like topics the
next one is wet and wild spring 2017
collection it has a couple different
products in it it has two highlighters a
lip palette and then I think one
eyeshadow palette everything that I
found about this collection show that it
only had one eye shadow but I kind of
remember seeing a picture that had
multiple eyeshadows in it so the
highlighters look pretty I think they're
cute I kind of want to try the pink one
swatches wise they looked nice so if I
have a matte CBS I might pick up the
pink one the purple one I just don't
need it I feel like I won't actually use
it and I have similar things in my
moonchild palette so I'll probably pass
on that the lip palette I have mixed
feelings about the lip palette I don't
know why the lip palette looks really
cheap it looks like kids makeup it looks
like you could do the like the kids
makeup challenge with that palette and
everyone would believe that it's kids
makeup but it's kind of cute at the same
time so yeah I don't know I mean I'm not
gonna buy it for sure I can't use it I
don't like to use lip palettes on my own
and I would never use a wet wild lip
palette like that on my clients so I'm
gonna pass on that but I do think it's
cute I think some people will definitely
get sucked in by little hearts and the
fact that it's white packaging and it's
probably gonna be pretty inexpensive
and if the pigmentation is there and the
you know quality the lipstick isn't
horrible I don't think it's like the
worst but you know and then the
eyeshadow trio
it just looks okay I honestly am kind of
over the like limited edition trios from
Wet n Wild I feel like the last one I
was actually really excited about was a
California roll palette which is super
pretty again I feel like it had a cool
color combination a cool idea behind it
and I haven't really seen anything quite
like that from them again so I'm
probably just going to pass on
everything but maybe that pink
highlighter okay last thing we're gonna
talk about today is the Smashbox trio
highlighter palette well I believe
they're called the spotlight palettes
and this is a collaboration with Casey
Holmes she has two palettes that she's
coming out with one's a gold and wants a
pearl since they did the two I feel like
it can reach a lot of different skin
tones lighter skin and deeper skin with
the gold tones I think these look really
pretty I think the packaging is nice and
slim overall I think they look nice I
think she put a lot of time into it I
really do think she worked hard on this
collab with Smashbox so if I had a bunch
of money and was buying stuff then I
would want to support it for her like I
really do think it's gonna be quality
and thought-out and everything but I
think it's just unfortunate that so many
highlighting palates are on the market
because if I had to place those within
what I've already talked about again the
Anastasi one just catches my eye more
and I'd probably buy that instead so
that's just kind of my thoughts I think
it's really pretty though that's
everything guys I hope you enjoyed this
video and I'm gonna try to get these out
more often for you guys that's what you
guys were saying in the comments and I'm
gonna try much I really hard I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
