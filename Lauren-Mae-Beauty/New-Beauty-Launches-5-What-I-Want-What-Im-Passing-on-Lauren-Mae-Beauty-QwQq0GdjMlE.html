learn thanks so much for watching this
is going to be yet another new Beauty
launches this is my fifth one so I will
link all the other ones down below in a
playlist if you want to check them out
in this series I talk about products
that are either about to launch or have
already launched or just newer to the
beauty community this is kind of my take
of an anti haul I really love watching
anti hauls but sometimes stuff isn't
just like bad and I feel like this is
more of just a discussion good/bad what
I feel on it I'm a beauty lover and also
a makeup artist so these are just my
thoughts on new things coming out and
you guys seem to like it so yeah let's
keep going there's some new stuff out
not too many highlighters this time man
last one was just jam-packed full that's
like all that was in there well let's
just get into it I'm like scooting over
this time so we can like have the
picture so smart the first brand I want
to talk about is Benefit they're coming
out with quite a few new products which
is exciting I remember there was a time
when Benefit had so much stuff out I
feel like so many beauty influencers
constantly we're talking about their
products are being sent products from
them and honestly the only big release
they've had is like a revamp of their
brow products but I mean I want some fun
stuff from them they have really cute
packaging I really like the look of
their brand so part of you is excited
that they're launching new stuff but not
all of it seems as exciting as I want it
to be so the first one I want to talk
about is the lip liner lipstick
situation that they're coming out with I
believe there are eight different shades
and they retail for $20 each this is
just a really good key product like
that's all I can say about it right I
don't think it's that difficult to use a
lip liner and then use a lipstick and I
honestly just don't think that this
product is even gonna work the way it's
supposed to I really wish that they put
their time and marketing and all these
things that they put into this product
and just came out with some really bomb
lip liners and lipsticks like just to
come out with some new stuff that's
awesome and that the formula is great
the colors are on trend and it would be
amazing why put all your money into this
product and the same
those eyeshadow things that they have
which are like one swipe whatever's it's
like I think a lot of us are past
gimmicks and it's just too gimmicky like
the only reason we're watching that is
because like Tottie's doing a video on
it cuz we all are like yeah does this
thing work but we're not gonna buy it
like honey we're not buying that no no
next let's talk about hula light this is
something I actually think is a great
addition to their line this is a take on
their hoola bronzer but it's a lighter
version for lighter skin tones I've used
hoola I'm actually panning a hoola
bronzer right now so I think that works
okay for light skin tones you just have
to be very careful with it so I think
that the lighter version is a great
addition to their line I mean it's
something they could have come out with
even before so this one I think is good
I'm probably not gonna purchase it who
lives not my favorite bronzer ever I
love the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer I also really like this laura
geller like light matte baked bronzer
that I've been using so I'm satisfied
right now but I think that it's great
for people to try out later in time I
think it will stand the test of time in
their line so I think it's a good
addition with that hoola product they're
also launching a hoola contour stick
it's a cream to powder I like cream to
powder products I feel like if you're
gonna do a cream product I usually like
the texture or something that just kind
of has a more dry finish on the skin
after you know it's dry the color on
this seems a little weird I obviously
haven't watched it in person it just
seems a little bit warm for a contour
stick I think a lot of people won't like
it for that but I personally like
something that isn't super cool or super
Orange I like something that's gonna
give a little bit of warmth to the face
a little bit of definition it might
still totally work I probably won't pick
it up I'd rather try other products or
use other products like on set I would
just use a darker foundation I don't
know it's an okay product I don't think
it's like absolutely horrible I just
think that maybe they should have had it
cooler if they're doing it as a contour
stick or called it a bronzer you know
the next product I want to talk about is
dandelion twinkle now I'm kind of
confused on whether this is supposed to
be like a shimmery blush or a
highlighter I would love to swatch this
one in person because I want to see how
intense the highlighter actually is
I did see a video of Kim Thai like I
don't know if it was for benefit like on
their Instagram or on her Instagram but
just sponsored by benefit or what but it
looked really pretty she's using a
couple different products it looked
really like Chloe but by looking at it
in the pan it doesn't seem like it would
be that glowy so it's one I kind of want
to like investigate I definitely think
benefit should come out with some powder
highlighters I know they have what's up
and they have the benefit high beam but
powder highlighters are definitely
missing in their collection and they
could capitalize on that so much since
they're so trendy I just don't know if
this was the best route to go it's such
a pink tone highlight so it's not gonna
work on everyone I don't know it's kind
of an interesting one so I like
appreciate the difference in it but I
really do want to swatch it and kind of
see more about it before I really have
like opinions on whether I think it'd be
good or I potentially might want to put
it on a list that I get in four years or
something yeah if you can't tell I don't
like to buy everything that comes out
because I got the money for everything
so I got to be picky I got to be picky
we should all probably be a little picky
and the last thing I wanted to talk
about from benefit is a blush palette
that they're coming out with this is
going to have two new products in it the
hoola light and also a new blush they're
coming out with witches I believe
California I don't think it's like
California girl everything I saw was
just like California blush that blush by
itself seems so pretty and I'm excited
to see them come out with something new
they used to come out with like blushes
more often I remember when I first
started watching YouTube it was her vana
was coming out then it was rocket or I
don't know maybe there was another one
in between there but it was just
happening more often so I think it's
really cool that they're having a new
blush but I'm kind of over benefit blush
palettes
it's a little frustrating to me because
there's just no value for the consumer
because a lot of people already have
these products maybe they're purchased
these products full-size or they
purchase the other blush palettes that
you had I guess it might be more cost
efficient to get them in the palette
because it might be cheaper to get two
or whatever but I just I wish that
palette was filled with a bunch of new
products and that would be such a better
value to the customer then basically
getting a bunch of redo powders oh plus
the two new ones so maybe they could do
a duo with those two new products or
even come out
some limited edition ones that are just
in that palette so there's just more of
like a it makes more sense I don't know
that's my take some people might really
like it if you haven't picked up a blush
palette from them before or any other
products it's a great way to try a lot
of stuff but I think a lot of us have
already bought those and I feel like
that's who they're marketing to our
people who love makeup so it just
doesn't have as high of a value if you
already have those products that's
enough about benefit there's just a lot
and I kind of had some feeling so I
thought it would talk about it next I
wanted to talk about this Clinique side
I saw Emily Noelle review this set it's
a chubby stick set and it's like Crayola
themed I thought it was just an
interesting concept I've never seen
anyone pair with Crayola but it kind of
makes sense since their color and these
are like lip products like color
cosmetics I don't know I thought it was
a cute little idea I was like oh that's
cute there are eight shades in the set
it retails for 4950 I think it's like
cute if you really like the chubby
sticks it might be a great way to try a
bunch of different colors yeah I don't
know I just wanted to bring it up I feel
like I haven't heard anyone really talk
about that besides Emily that was just
like a fun little cute set I saw next I
wanted to talk about a palette that I
saw on ulties website from pure now I
really like pure products I'm excited
that they're kind of revamping their
line they're getting their promotions
going they're getting their marketing
out there people are talking about them
a little bit more and when it comes to
complexion products I think they do a
good job I wish they had a better shade
range but I do think that their products
are nice now eyeshadows the little
liquid pots have had great reviews and
those are really nice but I've really
only seen one palette that I've ever
liked from them and it's old it's like a
rosy tone neutral all matte palette I
feel like that one didn't get nearly as
much love as it should have I only heard
again Emily talked about that palette
really but other than that they've come
out with just some like not good
palettes I feel like the quality isn't
quite there the packaging just looks
ugly and it looks bulky it looks like
there should be more product in the
palette for how much dead space there is
I also just feel like the price is
really high for what you're getting so
when I saw this little like almost like
a quad it's just like a smaller little
palette it's called the gold digger
vanity palette
I just I don't know I'm just not feeling
it I I just want a little bit more from
them I felt like they're they're trolls
palette was almost there like there was
something about it like oK we've got
some fun colors like I like the theme I
definitely can see the troll inspiration
going on alright there's just like
something off like you know when you're
just like but like there's something off
and I feel like I didn't really hear
anyone talk about it even though you
would expect to hear someone talk about
that like I'm sure they sent them out so
anyway this palette kind of it's just
not quite hitting the mark so I'm really
excited for them to finally put
something out that I think would really
stick and people will be excited for I
really hope they can find that because I
think that would just help boost them so
much that one's just not quite doing it
for me next let's talk about the Stila
magnificent metal glitter shadow things
everyone is using those look absolutely
stunning I don't think there's like some
conspiracy or some like sponsorship
thing going on with those I think that
they're good and maybe some people got
sent to them and I think I'll live in
that they're just awesome products
they're glitter which is like what
everyone on Instagram and YouTube loves
to use because it looks pretty it looks
fun I mean I want to watch tutorials
with glitter not just like basic brown
eyeshadows right anyway they're so
pretty I don't think I'll be picking up
like the whole range but I definitely
want to have a couple I think they're
just unlike into glitter I'm into fun
things and it's exciting for Stila to
put out something that's so fun and
seems to be actually like working so
many times you feel like brands come out
with products where the idea of it's so
great but in execution it just doesn't
quite translate and these ones seem to
perform on all levels so I want to pick
up some of the newly released ones they
just launched three new ones and they
are all like duochrome those seem like
totally up my alley so hopefully I'll be
able to pick some of those up soon
because they're really really pretty but
steel also came out with a new palette I
don't know why they did this it's called
the metal matte palette and it just
looks so boring it looks like basically
all their windows to the blank palettes
that have already been out I already
have two of those and since those
palettes are permanent I really don't
understand why they put that one out if
you're gonna pick up anything steal it
definitely pick up the fun new like
glitter liquid eyeshadows don't pick up
that palette I like for more things to
talk about next I wanted to bring up a
post I saw on trend mood it was just
like a collage of a bunch of tart sets
and I'm sorry I don't know if it's that
I have PTSD over like their holiday
palettes but I don't know what their
obsession is with like the TARDIS and
like having it in an artist like palette
looking thing they've done so much I
feel like it's like we're over it I why
do we have all this dead space on a
palette I just I don't know it just
feels like tarts up to their old ways on
that one but it's not even holiday time
I'm like it's just spring what's
happening so yeah I'm not even gonna
probably look at those I think they're
whole like aqua line is so much better
than that so yeah if you're like looking
for palettes or anything go with the in
bloom palette go with the aqua palettes
or you know the aqua line that they have
cuz they have so many products and that
I don't know it just rubbed me the wrong
way even just the pictures I couldn't
even find them on Ulta but I was just
like no no no no really you're still
what no feeling this videos a little
more negative than normal I'm really
sorry it's just I don't know I'm just
telling you how I feel if you guys want
all this stuff that's awesome like I'm
glad that it's doing it for you but it's
just not doing it for it's just not
quite doing it for me next we're some
Chanel blushes now these are things I'd
want in my dreams like I'm not gonna
spend the money on these but I think
they look really pretty and I probably
lived through Tara baby and see her
holla and swatch it and hopefully
that'll be enough for me they came out
with two colors ones more of like an
orange II red and the other ones more of
like a peachy pink I believe they just
look really pretty
they also came out with a highlighter
for a spring I believe these are for
spring and they're just beautiful I
don't need them I'm not gonna buy them
but man are they pretty next is a
product by the balm they came out with a
new blush called bomb Springs I have
quite a few of their blushes I have all
the boy blushes so I've down boy cabana
boy and frat boy I really like frat boy
it's a really pretty peachy color it's a
matte it's a little powdery but I think
it's
this one is more of a rosy color I think
it's a great addition to their line and
I have high hopes that it'll be good
because I like the formula there other
blushes am I going to just like pick it
up probably not I really don't need any
blushes but I think it's a nice addition
to their line and the last thing is
something I'm actually really excited
about BH Cosmetics is coming out with a
bunch of different highlighting palettes
I believe they have to like neutral
toned ones and then they have one that
is so pretty it's called the black light
palette and it's kind of like their
version of the holographic or duochrome
kind of highlighters that are coming out
I already have the moonchild palette and
I already have the alchemists palette so
it's like I definitely don't need this
and because I have those I really wasn't
looking at any of the duochrome
highlighters that are coming out this
one just looks so different it's almost
like pastel metallic colors I don't know
it looks so pretty in the swatches that
I saw I've never ordered anything off of
BH Cosmetics but this might be the thing
I don't know it's so pretty I don't know
if I'll actually buy it but if I saw any
videos on this I would definitely click
them all and watch them because I want
to see what that palette looks like and
what people's opinions are on it okay
guys that's everything for this video
let me know down below what your
thoughts are on the items I talked about
do you want them do you not want them
and why again even though I might have
some strong opinions either way I'd love
to hear what you guys think because
makeup is so personal and everyone has
different needs and wants when it comes
to makeup so I will see you guys in my
next video I hope you're having a
wonderful day thanks so much for
watching
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
