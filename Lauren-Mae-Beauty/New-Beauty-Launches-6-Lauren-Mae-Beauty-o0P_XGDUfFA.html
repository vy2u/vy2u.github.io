Lauren thanks so much for watching just
bear with me on my voice I am sick right
now but I am pushing past and we're
gonna crank out some videos anyway this
is going to be another episode of new
Beauty launches this is a series where I
go through new products that are
launching and let you know if I want
them if I don't want them its a mix
between an anti haul and like a wish
list someone left me a comment down
below saying that this is similar to a
will i buy it video so it's also similar
to those yeah i just give you my take on
new products coming out the first thing
i want to talk about is something that i
was super excited to see and it was the
anasazi beverly hills new glow palette
called aurora this is very similar in
like formatting a let me scoot over
there we go this is very similar in
formatting to the moonchild palette
which i own and i absolutely i think
it's really nice except for the glitter
which is the reason i won't be getting
this palette I think this palette is
beautiful I think it looks really pretty
I'm very fair though and I just don't
know if the highlights are gonna look
that great on my skin tone and I just
feel like for what they are I could
probably use an eyeshadow to get a very
similar look for how often I'll be
wearing a highlight like that so for me
although I think it's really beautiful
and there's a part of me that like wants
to have it to like complete the
collection I just know I won't actually
get an F you set of it to justify it
also like I mentioned the glitter I
don't understand what the glitter thing
is about
I don't like highlighters with glitter
in them I don't think anyone does so
it's really weird when brands come out
with highlighters with a ton Experion um
I'm like no no one wants that so that's
also the other thing like I know how
much I dislike the glitter in the
moonchild palette that I wouldn't want
to repurchase another palette like that
although I do love my moonchild palette
it's a twisted situation next I want to
talk about the Tarte make believe in
yourself which I don't know is anyone
like weirded out by that name like I
know it's like a play on like make
believe in unicorns and stuff but it's
like I don't know why when I initially
heard it it just sounds like the
opposite of believe in yourself is that
weird or something I know they mean it
the other way I just when I hear it it's
like make believe in yourself like it's
not real like don't actually believe in
your
I'll make believe in years I don't know
anyway so it's like a whole collection
of products I wanted to talk about the
eyeshadow palette I will be duping that
palette today be on the lookout for that
video it was requested in my last let
stupid video when I saw this I thought
it was really pretty I thought it was
interesting that hurt was gonna be doing
something new I mean half the palette is
still neutrals don't get me wrong but
the other half is something a little bit
different so that was exciting to see
from them I do like the concept of this
whole collection I think it's fun and
whimsical and I do think that it's very
on-trend it's what people I think are
gravitating to is that like unicorn
situation I just don't feel like it was
whimsical enough like if you're gonna go
for it go for it it's a pretty palette I
just wish they went a step further it
was still super safe but they're trying
to act like it's so crazy like it's not
that crazy
you put a blue in there like a shimmery
blue like that's it and then the middle
part is like a duochrome shadow I just
felt like that shadow is quite large I
don't know I just wish that more of it
was duo chrome and more of it had just
more inspiration I feel like there's a
lot to go off with the entire collection
and its concept and I think that they
just didn't take it quite far enough I
feel like people would have still loved
something that went a little bit further
in this collection is also a set of
unicorn brushes I feel like there was
like I remember hearing a scandal about
the unicorn brushes and then like
ripping off some other brands unicorn
brushes but these look different than
the original ones I thought they were
gonna do these are like all gold I think
they're really pretty I would never
spend the money on them personally I
don't know I just wouldn't I just I
don't know I think they're really cute
though if they were cheap I'd buy them
but they're not gonna be cheap so no and
last is the highlighter this is actually
something that's been tempting me I
don't know why because the outside
packaging of it is super cute but the
inside I think looks really cheap like
the stripes I don't know why it just
reminds me of like a drugstore product
but for some reason I'm really just
gravitating to this highlighter I kind
of want to get it I think I'm gonna
check out if it's 30% off with the tarte
friends and family sale that's going on
right now and if it is I might pick it
up I don't know why I just
want this highlighter and you guys know
that I'm not a highlighter girl but this
one for some reason it just looked
really pretty I feel like it looks
pretty cool toned on the skin that's
like the one thing out of all of it that
was like attracting me the most plus the
free headbands that sold out really fast
with the unicorn horn that's really what
I want from this collection bring those
bags let's move on next to the Carli
bybel palette this is something that's
actually tempting me as well I don't
know when it'll go on sale all of the
dates and anything like that prices will
all be down below so you can check this
out as well as links it looks like a
really beautiful palette I'm kind of
disappointed that she put in shades from
her original palette so many people have
already bought that I know it was
limited edition but it was like limited
edition for like two years so a lot of
people have invested in that palette
already quite a few shades I want to say
like 8 or so shades are the same as
what's in that palette I wish it was
just all brand new shades maybe take a
similar inspiration they can be similar
colors but for it to be the exact same
colors it just feels like less of a
value for the customer you could have
just taken all this out made the smaller
palette similar to the first one took
the price down and it would have been a
better value for the customer but
regardless it still looks really pretty
I'm tempted because I also want those
highlighter that highlighter palette
from BH so I might just like get both
about I don't know we'll see if I
actually buy any of these things but it
definitely is piquing my interest I
think it's really pretty
I just wish it was all brand new shades
next I wanted to talk about the color
pop collections they did a whole
monochromatic type of collection so they
came out with the pink one the peach one
in the sands one I believe I thought
these were actually really pretty the
peach one was really beautiful the face
do that came with that was really pretty
I felt like the lip products were all
really pretty honestly for me color pop
used to be like not tempting at all but
now that they've really single shadows
seriously takes everything in my freakin
body not to buy every single collection
that comes out and all the pressure
atoms that come out with it I'm really
excited to order some more stuff from
their website I don't know when that
will be but I'm definitely looking into
some of the pressed shadows that came
out with these three collections for my
future purchases I thought
really pretty and I'm excited to see
what I'll stay happy always they're
coming out with stuff and I'm not always
into it but I do like a monochromatic
look so I could buy into that
inspiration and that concept for their
collections plus you guys know I love
like pink peach and brown like that's
like my eyeshadow like all the time so
yeah I liked it next is Urban Decay and
they have a couple different things
coming out the first is their special
effects topcoat it's kind of like a lip
gloss but it's more like sparkly and
shimmery I've seen some swatches and
some reviews they look okay I think
they're really pretty and they like the
idea of it again I just wish brands were
putting more out there like I want more
opacity I want more glitter
I want more duochrome I just want more I
want every product to be like those
Stila glitter eyeshadow you know what I
mean like that's what I want everything
to come out with if you're gonna do it
freakin do it let's go I don't know I'm
not really good at product person anyway
they kind of tempted me a little but
probably not next from Urban Decay is a
collection it's the best yet collection
Italy that I pronounce his name it has
two eyeshadow palettes it has a blush
palette three liners and three lipsticks
I actually think this collection is
really exciting from Urban Decay it's
like the first thing I feel like I've
seen from Urban Decay in a while and I'm
actually like excited to like test out
and swatch and see what it's about the
eyeshadow palettes just look fun I mean
they're definitely very Urban Decay it's
not like they've never done anything
like it I don't know something about it
is a little bit different than what
they've been really seeing recently I
really thought that the liners were
really pretty too so I'm excited to try
this out I know there's some controversy
about them like using his art and
whatnot I don't really know much about
that whole thing or the scandal or like
even Basquiat himself so I don't feel
like I have a dog in the spite but I did
read something saying that it's like his
family is who owns it his like rights to
his artwork and stuff so I feel like
they're the ones that shouldn't be
putting this out there if it's against
what he believed in but I don't really
know anyway because I really know
nothing about that so but the next is a
palette from Too Faced in it's the
glitter bomb palette I have to give it
up to two-face they are constantly
releasing
stuff and I feel like they have some
inspired stuff they definitely have
inspiration I feel like all their stuff
is just almost there though it's just
not quite there I don't know what it is
I like the idea of a glitter palette I
like glitter but I just don't think this
is the palette for me when it comes to
glitter I don't know what's the
inspiration behind this palette with the
colors I don't really know it just looks
like a weird cran box of colors I can
just imagine it being so shimmery and
not anything spectacular when it comes
to a glitter shadow that I just don't
know we'll see though maybe swatches
will prove me wrong I want to be into it
so bad but I don't think I am man I feel
like I'm just like against everything
well I just said I like the Urban Decay
one alright I'm like all over the place
it's the sickness that's we're gonna
call it we're gonna blame it on the
sickness next is the Kat Von D sinner
and Saint palette we got a sneak preview
of this when she made her video about
makeup revolution and them like copying
her shade and light palette no I wanted
to really like this like I wanted to
like it cuz it's Kat Von D I like the
packaging she definitely has a concept I
just feel like it looks so similar to
the star studded palette which is what I
used to have it came out a couple of
holiday collections ago and honestly I
never used that palette I didn't enjoy
that palette and so I'm just like I have
like flashbacks to not using that and
not enjoying that palette so I don't
think that I will be picking this one up
nothing about it says I should get it
and I feel like I was burned by the last
kat von d palette like big purchase that
I bought which was the metal matte
palette and although it's beautiful I
don't use it so I don't think I will be
picking that one up next is the Jeffrey
star in Mani collaboration I've never
bought anything from Jeffrey star and I
probably never will it's just not a
brand that I really really want to try
out that bad they're into highlighters
and liquid lipsticks and those are the
two things that I'm kind of like over so
you know it just doesn't really work out
but I will say that the highlighter that
they came out with I feel like as a
color I would really like it's not too
peachy it's not too golden I just I feel
like it's a really pretty color so I
probably will never buy it but I do
think it's pretty if it was given to me
for free I probably
like it I know a lot of people hate on
them and I don't know exactly where I
stand I feel like I stopped watching
their videos and now I'm like watching
their videos again there's something
entertaining about them you cannot deny
that especially when they're together I
don't know I don't know what it is you
know good on them I feel like it was a
good collab because it made it just made
sense in that way but I've mostly think
the highlighter is like the standout
next is a collection from zoeva I think
that's how you pronounce it it's not a
zoeva I think it's so Eva and it's the
sweet flavor collection it's a really
pretty assortment of eyeshadows I just
thought this is very interesting it
looked very easier to be something that
was really just a little bit different
so that was something that was kind of
like interesting and I don't know I
really liked it plus I've heard really
good things about their eyeshadow
palettes from other youtubers so I think
that was really great it also came with
a blush palette and that looked nice as
well not my favorite I'd probably get
the eyeshadow palette over it but I
thought this was like a cool collection
and I feel like I never hear anyone talk
about it that's like so irritating to me
too it's like I want to hear about all
the different collections coming out so
then I can make my decision of like okay
I have X amount of money I want to spend
on spring releases so which ones do I
feel like are different and whatever and
I feel like I'm all hearing about you
know six brands and there's so many more
brands in them and last last one for
this video is the Nicki and Oprah collab
I think it's great that Nicki had a new
collaboration the highlighter looked
really beautiful again I've been sitting
here talking about liquid lipsticks and
highlighter here's I think that the
highlighter looked really beautiful I
liked that it had the three different
sections I feel like it could work for
ton of different skin tones you can
swirl it all together I did think that
worked super well and it looks just
really really pretty I seen swatches and
it still looks super beautiful the
liquid lipsticks aren't really my style
like none of the shades really draw B in
I recently did make a purchase and
liquid lipsticks from cosmetics I saw
that she's totally revamping her brand
and I just wanted to try them out I
don't know what it was very much an
impulse buy but I will be doing like a
first impression swatch wear throughout
the day video on those I don't know why
I just wanted to try them out I like the
price point too I liked everything about
it and I kind of wanted to give her a
second chance after the whole you know
and cosmetics first launch debacle I
feel like I just stopped her stuff was
the life palette what okay anyway back
to the nikkietutorials clap the biggest
thing for me is like this is just so
expensive I don't want to take anything
away from Oprah but it's ridiculous how
much they charge for their products I
know you can use 30% off and use a coat
but for the packaging that they put
their stuff in like highlighters should
not be $40 this collapse should not be
$79 what like that's what you're trying
to pretend is the retail value of this
like give me a break I think that's
crazy
I really do for an unknown brand am I
being crazy right now I mean I guess
it's $20 apiece it's for items but I
just feel like that's so expensive it's
so crazy I think like $50 for pallets
expensive and that's 30 more dollars
than a pallet I definitely think the
price should have been a little bit
lower I know it goes down to like 55
with the discount if you use her coat
but I just wish it was a little bit less
expensive because the highlighters not
coming in some amazing packaging the box
that it's packaged and was beautiful the
display of it was beautiful but the
actual packaging that's what you're
gonna keep it's not beautiful it's just
cheap which there's nothing wrong with
that I just wish the price reflected it
you know I do have one item from Ophir I
got for free it generation Beauty last
year so I haven't really tried a ton of
their stuff so maybe it's just amazing
and it's worth the price but I just feel
like for what I see it's just expensive
so and if you guys have gotten that
collab let us know what you think of it
down below that is everything for my new
Beauty launches video I hope you guys
enjoyed this I hope I wasn't too crazy
and all over the place I feel like I was
a little more more chill a little bit
more out of it because I'm freaking my
eyes are hard to even keep them open
right now they're just like wanting to
close and my nose wants to cry okay guys
that's everything
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
