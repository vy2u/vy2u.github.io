learn thank so much for watching this is
going to be another episode of new
Beauty lunches if you haven't seen this
video from you before this is a series
where I talk about new products that are
launching in the beauty community my
thoughts on them whether I want them
whether I don't just kind of a mix of an
anti haul or a wish list or just
whatever I feel I have quite a few
products like always there's always new
crap coming out so I'm going to actually
scoot over at the front of this video
and now we can get started number one
first we're just getting into it is
Urban Decay Naked heat pallet this is
probably the newest thing that I've seen
this is a pallet it's coming out June
12th for presale I believe it will be
everywhere though June 30th and it has
12 new shades it's in the same format as
their other naked palettes it's going to
retail for $54 and this is probably the
most exciting Naked palette that there
is if you've seen my declutter videos
you guys know I got rid of all my naked
palettes I have the 1 the 2 and the 3
and I discovered in them because I'm
just over them I never use them and
never reach for them obviously today my
look is very intense but I do usually
like either more intense or just
different shades or matte shades and
they just weren't doing it for me this
one it seems promising it's probably the
one I like the most out of all of them
including the smoky palette I would
definitely need to see like swatches and
reviews and I would definitely take my
time on this it's probably not going to
be limited edition so I'm not going to
like run out and buy it right away but I
think it's a good move on their part
that is very trendy but on the same note
it's kind of the same thing we're seeing
everywhere right it's just the warm
neutrals the warm red neutrals man
overall though I think it is an exciting
release from them and it looks promising
that there are more maps in this palette
than in the other naked palette so
hopefully that's true number two we have
some new releases from Becca she's
coming out with white chaser
highlighters which is basically the
duochrome highlighters there are six
different shades and they are releasing
June 7th they'll be available by the
time this video is up I think they look
really pretty but I just feel like the
duochrome highlighter thing is just kind
of like exhausted there's only so many
shades of like duochrome I feel like you
can have I mean formulas are all
different I don't know I think they're
pretty I just don't know if I'd want a
single huge pan of a duo creme
highlighter I have two palettes as
anasazi moonchild and I have the Kat Von
D alchemist and I like them because for
the value they're little more expensive
but I get a bunch of different shades
all in one whereas those you're buying
one pan for quite a bit of money so they
look beautiful especially with the
glosses which I will be talking about
next but I don't know I probably will
not buy them just because I have so many
duochrome shades I feel like if you have
a bunch of dual Chrome's you could make
a similar look and since it's not a
super wearable thing for a lot of people
I don't think you need them but those
glosses I think those are really pretty
these are the crystal glosses again I
believe there are six shades and I think
they look really pretty I'm really into
the fact that like duochrome glosses
really sheer glosses are coming out I'm
not a big fan of like liquid lipsticks
so I am really on board with something
that's like hydrating
I love duo chrome and something that's a
little bit different and they look
beautiful like this watches look really
fun I like set that sheer and again it's
not like full pigment it just has a
little bit of something so I think that
those look exciting but I feel like I
think they look exciting from any brand
who is coming out with them I know food
of beauty is coming out with like some
similar like metallic duochrome e type
of glosses anything in that room I'm
kind of excited about number three I I
know I waited till number three to talk
about it we are talking about the Jaclyn
hill and morphing palette they have
finally released pictures of it and like
seriously I know that everyone has
already said this which I'm so happy
about but it looks as the cake like I
know that picture got leaked and it
should have been released that soon we
should have seen that picture but I
don't understand why she lied that the
cake is not the colors obviously there
are slight differences because it's like
different products and they were just
trying to match the palette to the cake
like come on like you knew it would come
out that you're lying and I just don't
like the whole idea of lying about it
like if she was like I don't know maybe
the cake isn't and like try to like be
cheeky about it or something like that
it'd be different but like to be
straight up like well those aren't even
the same colors that are in the palette
but they are and the lie detector
determined that that was a lie that's
kind of frustrating to me and to me that
more speaks on like
character and just making you just a
little like rant like my little like
ears are up or I don't know spidey
senses I knowledge
I honor like that anyway back to the
actual talent I think it's really pretty
pallid it's gonna retail for $38 for 35
shades which is more expensive than
their normal palette I mean it kind of
makes sense because its chaplain hell
it's still an affordable palette it kind
of sucks that they did go up in price
for it it's like castling lights just
something and it was 15.99 which I feel
like it wasn't as many shades but it was
less in price I don't know I just I
don't know how I feel about that so
anyway I think it's pretty I don't think
it's anything brand new I feel like
there was so much hype about it and so
much talk about like it taking two years
to pick out these colors and I'm just
kind of like but why though I know
there's a new formula so hopefully
that's really good like I said I have
the kathleenlights palette and I think
that the more fish I was they were okay
they weren't like blow my mind but for
$15 like yabba's there's some good
shadows I'm down with it I'm interested
in seeing swatches and see how people
are liking it once they get their hands
on it I probably will not be purchasing
it I don't have like a super like love
for Jaclyn hill I think she's really
talented I think she was really pretty I
I just don't
she's not one of them like my favorite
people ever so I definitely won't be
buying the palette just for her name
sake and since it's shades that I feel
like I have in different palettes it
just doesn't feel necessary to me next
we have Lime Crime and they are coming
out with a whole mermaid collection I
talked about Lime Crime and my last one
and there's just no denying their
packaging they're like ideas for stuff
are definitely something that I can
connect with
even if I'm connecting with it in a bad
way the last one I talked about with
like the milf liquid lipsticks said that
was in cigarette carton packaging and
that was very sought out in a way and it
definitely had a vibe to it and it was
definitely a thing but I did not like it
it is kind of a weird mix but it looks
really cool like that's like the one
thing I think that connect with them on
their packaging they're like ideas for
things even if they're off to me are
definitely something that catches my eye
more than other
and anyway to have the new highlight
palette coming out they have one
originally which is again that zero
chrome type of highlighter and now
they're coming out with one that has a
lavender shade and ivory shade and a
seafoam green it kind of reminds me of
the Anastasia Aurora palette very
similar where it's like a little bit of
a darker highlight but could work on
like medium skin tones to the best then
they have some metallics all the teens
that are coming out they're going to be
three new shades as though this again a
lavender one kind of like a sunset coral
one and then a blue one which are really
pretty those are retailing for twenty
nine which i think is a little pricey I
don't know if they're metallic ones just
retail for more or what but that's kind
of a lot for liquid lipstick and then
last they have some aquarium brushes now
the whole thing with these that in the
handle there's like glitter and water
it's a cool idea it also seems a little
juvenile but the price on them is pretty
good it's $58 for seven different
brushes and as the quality of the
brushes is good I think that's a good
price for something kind of cool and
something that's going to last you for
forever and you potentially could use in
your makeup routine every single day
overall I probably won't buy any of that
stuff but I think it's kind of a cool
collection I think it's pretty they
caught my eye moving on we have the
lorac and the Beauty and the Beast
collection this like surprised me it was
like I don't know where I feel like my
rock has a whole collection with Beauty
disease which it's weird because it came
out like after the movie it didn't oh
they timed it to the release of it on
DVD I think I think that's what I saw
one time because I was like this is so
late
but I think that's how they justified it
I don't know they tried to sell us more
crap for beating these I don't know how
I feel about this I'm kind of getting a
little irritated with Laura I feel like
they're coming out with all these
palettes the branch palette was a no-go
for me the Pirates collection was okay
and if it was just the Pirates
collection I could let it go but now
that I see the Beauty and the Beast
palette I just feel like it cheapens the
Pirates won to me and I feel like
they're trying to keep up with everyone
else
and there any releases and so they're
trying to come up with like branded
stuff and I'm just not a fan I feel like
the colors in it are boring there's
supposedly 16 new shades never before
seen but it's just kind of boring I
don't even think I saw gold in there
which I feel like would be kind of you
know makes sense with her dress
everything I just feel like it was a
bunch of neutral palettes slapped with
the Beauty and the Beast
like theme to it the packaging is bulky
I don't know what they're doing with the
packaging we love their sleek slim
packaging and now they're coming out
with all this boxy like it's like we're
going back in time like instead of
progressing we're going back and I'm
like please stop please put out some
like good quality stuff some inspired
stuff I don't know I'm not going to buy
it for sure the blush palette you guys
know I'm always a sucker for their blush
palette I'm always like I kind of want
that one though and I'm just kind of
tired I'm tired they came out with one
for the California Dreaming collection
they came out with one for pirates and
they came out with one for this it's
like the same blushes I feel like it's
just neutrally blushes you just don't
need all of it if you're going to be
coming out with new stuff constantly I
feel like it needs to look different
than the last one maybe they're taking
tips from Tarte I don't know I just hope
that the hype train hasn't gotten lorac
where they're just trying to do like
cash grabs for people's money and
slapping on like Disney stuff hoping
collectors will want it it's not working
for me last for that collection they had
a set of lipsticks and lipglosses it's
five lip products in each set which i
think is really good I personally if I
could get a discount on it I'd love to
get the glosses for my kids because
they're all very neutral nude shades I
think there's a red in there they're
pretty it is nothing special once again
I'm just looking at it as like a makeup
artist and like oh it's a lot of
different shades for a relatively good
price than buying them individually
I like the formula so it would work for
me but I feel like for an individual
again you just don't need it you know
just like lackluster I feel like the
L'Oreal Beauty and the Beast was so much
better you know that no one could get
only in like Italy Amazon or whatever
the heck out thing was that was better
than this and that's that because that's
like drugstore and come on moving on
we're going to talk about the balm
they're coming out with a new palette
called nude beach it's kind of a third
take on their nude two nude dudes now
it's new Beach valid the colors in it
look really pretty I'm hoping a formulas
good I feel like they're formula has
consistently gotten worse I have the new
tube palette I never used it and I
discovered it so I probably won't buy
this if you're going to buy it I guess
want to just getting it half
there was some type of sale or on
HauteLook or something like that
I bought the bomb out petite pallet and
I didn't like that either so I just
realized the quality potential on this
is kind of keeping me away it looks okay
it's nothing new to your collection for
sure but it's it's nice it's okay
I don't know Kat Von D is coming out
with a couple new products I feel like
she's always kind of launching these
despots one of the parts I'm actually
excited about is the Lolita eyeshadow
it's also a blush it's limited edition
it's $19 I believe you can get that
Sephora now I think it's really pretty
I like those types of shades so I feel
like I would like it but like I just
said in this get ready with me which I
don't know this will be at first or that
will be at first either way it'll be
linked down below but the cola pop blush
from Clinique is what I have on my eyes
right now and I feel like it's buried
somewhere it's a very similar look it
might not be an exact dupe if you swatch
them next to each other so I don't know
I basically would do is definitely what
I did with this blush with that eye
shadow flash blush so I'm like I don't
know if I need a whole one but it looks
beautiful I really do like the color I
love those like warm tones I feel like
it brings out the blue in my eyes so
it's something that like definitely
caught my eye I like that it's like
basically just like a powder product but
you can use it on that and you can use
it as a blush you can like do what you
want with it and that's something I
really like about Kat Von D I like the
artist that she chooses for her like
makeup line as well she wants able to be
creative she's okay with things looking
a little bit differently I love I love
that so anyway I'm interested in that
probably the thing I think is the most
interesting out of everything which is
kind of weird and the other thing can
kind of mirror is the glimmer palette
now this is a take on the shade and
light palette but these are all going to
be like shimmery glimmery shades there
are four different finishes of glimmer
in this palette swatches ah not
convincing me I think that they look
chunky and glittery and not cool and I
don't know I agency swatches maybe that
would convince me a little bit more I
don't know the shade and light palette
so I don't think I'll buy this one I
think it's an interesting concept
I just really hope the formulas good I
really hope they're not chunky and
glittery and basically like a version of
the two-faced glitter bomb palette but
with neutrals
I'm just hoping to have some really nice
metallic glimmery shades that would
really pair well
with the shade and light palette that's
my hope but we'll see when more swatches
come out next I want to talk about some
new makeup geek releases they're coming
out with a palette called in the nude it
has four new matte shades so I love that
there's a lot of matte shades in here it
has nine shadows total and it's going to
be $50 the palette as a whole is pretty
but it's nothing special to me and I
think it's kind of expensive honestly I
just feel like by the shades you want
from the like individual shadows that
she has to offer I already own in the
spotlight in grandstand which are
included in this palette so I don't need
those if she's going to put together a
palette I want to see more of like color
inspiration like I feel like some of the
more indie brands that I'm following not
that she's not in do she is but like
even more indie than her there's me like
the pineapple palette and I look fun
they're inspired by pineapples and like
that's kind of cool like I just want to
see more colors version than like in the
nude we already we got it we got it we
love news I just I don't know unless you
are trying to like maybe try out to make
a peach shades you can maybe get this
palette I feel like it's kind of
expensive all in one go to get shades
that I either have I just wish it was
all new shades and that at least you
could justify it that way like it's all
new shadows I don't have any of them
individually so value wise it's
definitely better than buying them
singly but since I have some of them
doesn't really work out that way for me
it just kind of meets you know like why
why do we need it we don't and then she
all just coming out with some different
like bronzers they're called like bronze
luster let's see yeah bronze luster is
three different shades they retail for
$22 and I think this is the thing that's
kind of like weird to me I love Marlena
I think that she's a really beautiful
woman I like her style I really respect
her as someone who wants to start my own
makeup line eventually I you know I just
have a lot of respect for her but I
don't know I really get started off
being like affordable and now it's
slowly going into like not affordable
and I know she tries to use really good
ingredients and she is stepping up the
packaging and stuff but I just wish that
she kept it more affordable like I wish
these bronzers instead of $22 for 13 or
14 or 15 max you know what I mean I wish
stayed affordable so the prices are
slowly creeping up the shadows $5.99 for
a shadow that's awesome especially as
you get it in the pan and all that but
then the foil der ten and then you know
now things are they're just creeping up
I feel like and that's a little
disappointing to me because I really
wish that she was offering these awesome
products that just a little bit more
affordable rate because twenty dollars
for something is a lot of money I think
we forget that when a lot of products
are more expensive than that but that's
still a lot of money that's like a Kylie
highlighter those are $22 I believe - so
just say number nine Tarte is coming out
with the tartlet toasted palette in fall
of this year I think our looks really
pretty I think it's a good addition to
their tartlet line like the in bloom
isn't quite as warm as that one I don't
think you need to in bloom and this
toasted one but I don't have the in
bloom so I like the Tarte formula of
those shadows I have the original
tartlet and I use it in my kids it has a
really nice cool time sheets this makes
purple Mavi shades and it's all matte
personally I like this a lot better than
like the round disk palettes that are
like rainforest at the sea wand like
volume 1 volume 2 volume 3 that are just
like boring attack I don't know I feel
like we could get rid of all those and
just have this I just wish that they do
in some bars the market with so many of
their other palettes that I feel like
are very similar to this so on its own
is a standalone palette I think it's
pretty but don't worry I look at art and
everything they come out with and all
the different things that they do it's
definitely nothing new it's just like
the man-eater palette put into there and
the new one to put into there I don't
have much else to say
you guys know where I'm coming from on
that and last I just wanted to mention
the two pink glitter bomb palette again
and just say that it's still a hell no
from me dog swatches of this thing look
horrible nah nah definitely not more
tempted seeing swatches and it come out
actually now I feel a sound mind to not
get that palette okay that is everything
guys I hope you enjoyed this video
definitely let me know what you guys
think down below these products if you
have them if you don't if you want them
if you don't I'd love to hear your
opinions and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
