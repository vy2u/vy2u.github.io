Lauren thank you so much for watching
we're doing a new beauty launches today
it's been a second I had risen one of
these out and I had waited so long to
tell me that everything was just like
old and like who cares about it anymore
so I have new stuff to talk about and
I'm going to let you know well I buy it
will I not do I think it's a good
purchase or a good move by the company
do you guys know how these videos work
and if you don't check out my other ones
and you'll find out or keep watching
I'll move it over and we're starting
with number one so my first new view you
want to talk about is the Sephora and
Moschino Machino how do you say that
might be only one and just kind of like
not cool like I don't know I can't
afford stuff let me see I'm going to go
find my phone so I can try to do a
little research and as to how to
pronounce that okay let's see you ready
we're going to listen to it together I
know most you know most Jeannot Jeannot
thank you pronunciation book so mosquito
and Sephora are coming out with a collab
and it is releasing August 11th and the
thing I want to talk about the most is
the eyeshadow palette in the bear
packaging it's 21 shades it's only $45
which I honestly thought it'd be more
money because Marc Jacobs is more I
don't know it's kind like designer I
just figured it'd be more money
Sam pound you hear any noises it's a
matome but anyway the eye shadow bear
palette we've had a lot of the
disruptions for this first on
geez I think it looks pretty cool I'm
kind of excited for it I don't know if
I'll purchase it but I do think that
price wise I would like thinking it was
gonna be a $65 range and I thought that
$45 was pretty a pretty good price if
it's pigmented and swatches are good
maybe it'd be like a fun little thing I
don't know
I mean it's colorful and kind of fun I'm
neither here nor there on it but I am
happy with the price and for the cool
packaging I think that it's like you're
not trying to just take all your money
and I like that there's a bunch of other
stuff in the collection but I've decided
that I'm trying to like limit myself and
talking about like a million things
because it makes me really dread editing
videos so you know that's no fun for me
so I'm trying to keep it to actually ten
we'll see how I do
moving on to number two let's talk about
50 beauty by Rihanna coming to simple or
I'm super pumped for this now I know a
lot of people are coming out with makeup
lines and we'll see how they turn out
but I'm really excited for Rihanna's
because it's going to be in Sephora I
feel like it's legit I feel like it has
a potential to be like cap on key I
think it's gonna be great for women of
color I'm sure it'll have amazing shade
ranges and I'm just I have really high
hopes to work so I can't wait to see
what she launches what's coming out the
quality to see all the reviews I'm
actually really hyped up for it I'm
really hoping that she does some like
awesome things and I feel like she'll
like seriously be the Kat Von D but
Rihanna how cool is that so exciting and
that will be in September 8th so it's
coming out guys number three Blasio came
out with louder which is a powder from
them
this has three shades a light medium a
medium deep and a rich shade for $35 it
really looks pretty pretty for glossier
their stuff is like expensive but also
not like I don't I feel like their
prices are kind of like mass prints in
sector like 35 for a loose powder it's
kind of expensive and I kind of
disappointed in like three shades I
really hope that the darker shades in
here will actually be darker skin tones
that would be amazing but obviously
we're missing out on the lighter skin
which is buying we usually usually it's
anything there's like light and medium
for sugar and everything and then if
there's anything outside of that it'll
be like super fair and then if there's
anything outside of that it'll be like
really dark so I'm glad that they're
hopefully catering to that side a little
bit more someone is at least I probably
will pick it up I just think 35 is a lot
of money for it I wasn't expecting it to
be at that great point oh my gosh
I think I just realized that the air was
on the whole time that is so
disappointing
I'm not going to retell it I'm sorry
guys so I'm really sorry that all of the
noise for the last one sucked
this video has turned into crap since
Sam got home I'm blaming him okay number
four pure is coming out with a mind Pony
palette it's going to be $29 which is an
awesome price point it's 16 shades that
it really
August 10 I'm kind of excited for this
one it's kind of similar to the troll
thing they're definitely going with like
weird collabs but whatever whatever
inspires them it's just I feel like the
cult the the brands or like whatever
they're choosing to collab with just
don't seem like pure to me it's like
they don't really mix but they're doing
it these colors look really fun and
bright something definitely different
for them and I'm kind of excited if the
pigmentation is there I'm down for it I
love the price point it definitely looks
like my little pony so I don't know man
I'm definitely want to see some review
see some swatches of nothing I'm going
to buy her but I think it's kind of cool
next for number five I'm going to talk
about the Sephora Pro palette now I
actually talked about these in a new
beauty launches that I never posted and
I thought I'd still wanted to talk about
them because I the reviews will come out
and most people say they're really good
maybe a little powdery but overall
pigmentation is there but I'm sorry I am
NOT or can surprise like $65 is way too
much money for Sephora to be charging
that price I'm sorry it is I don't care
how good of quality it is it's still
Sephora brand and the packaging isn't
different like I don't understand where
they came up with that price point and
why people are paying it I don't think
we should encourage this type of
behavior I don't know I just feel like
that's too much money why are they doing
that I do think the editorial palette
looks beautiful raw Beauty Christy says
it's really nice so I'm there's like a
part of me that's still tempted but at
the same time I really don't want to buy
it and support them charging that much
money for a palette like I just think
that's too much twenty sixty five
dollars for Sephora brand like I
wouldn't feel proud about having that in
my kit you know if I'm being honest so I
really just wish that they had hit like
fifty dollar mark you know but I know
you're going to a lot of shade I'm not
saying the quality's bad I just really I
was really shocked at that price and I
didn't think it was worth it number six
we're going to talk about the auto
salvia subculture palette now honestly I
just got this in the mail today like I
just got home it's in here I haven't
even opened it yet maybe I'll open it
right now I bought this once
Sephora launched it I did
like go through on a Sofia plus a
discord F card so I just waited until
the palette was available online and
that's an all the crazy reviews came out
I have a little video talking about my
opinions on the subculture fiasco or
drama that's happening oh yeah here we
go so if you want to check that video
out I will leave a link down below this
isn't it I'm so excited this isn't like
a first impressions review I'm going to
be doing all my normal stuff I just
thought I wasn't expecting to get this
the last group of videos I filmed its
that same day I just wanted had lunch I
had got Thai food with a friend and so I
came back with a different lip on and
just kept filling Tess filling the day
away so obviously I would buy it I was
really excited for this palette I
thought it looked so pretty I loved the
whole idea about it I love the color
scheme everything but I am a little
terrified because of all of the reviews
but I also think that they're all kind
of I don't know I don't know how I feel
about the reviews so that's it I would
buy this I will be doing more on this
palette I'm honestly not even going to
give you guys the first impressions
because I really want to do a more
research out things and just like
homeless battery you know anyway I will
also be doing a less stupid with this
palette since I have the color so that
way if this was something that you tried
it didn't work for you or if it's
something you just don't even want to
mess around with I can give you as close
to color dupes as I have in my
collection so be on the lookout for that
but anyway it's cost $42 we all know
everything about this palette I really
don't need to get into it I don't think
right
alright number seven melt has a new
collection called the hot box collection
and more specifically I want to talk
about the haystack I think it looks
really really pretty
I've heard about this pot and seeing
people's PR packages I'm pretty sure
there was some type of issue with them
sending out like I don't know a pipe or
something with the hot box collection
because it kind of goes with the same
with hotboxing I don't really know I
feel like I haven't seen anyone actually
use it on the eyes and swatch it though
I'm like waiting for some cool video I
really would love to have any of the
melt stacks except for the gunmetal one
it's just not my preference out of
everything but I've heard only good
things I would love to get them I don't
know many of them and this one just
looks like a really nice addition to the
collection the only thing I will say is
like there
like I know all that we all know that
but think about $48 for four shades of
eyeshadow I know that it's independent I
love supporting that and everything but
that is crazy expensive like this is 42
for a whole palette and that's just for
shadows and even if you don't like that
one and you like modern renaissance
sounds still only 42 so number eight cat
Bunge is coming out with glimmer veils
they're going to be liquid lipsticks
that are like shimmering I think dudes
look really cool and surprises and come
out with something like this sooner
there's going to be nine different
shades they're coming soon we don't know
when I'm assuming they'll be at a
similar price point to our liquid
lipsticks now maybe a little bit more
most of my pictures should be from trend
nude so I will leave them down in the
description box if you don't already
follow them on Instagram if you want to
be kept up to date with all the new
releases and launches that is definitely
the Instagram account you want to follow
they always got the new stuff on their
Instagram two more things to talk about
next I want to talk about aids buttes
quintessential palette again this is
something I've only seen on trend moves
Instagram and then I started following
on base beauty because of that but it's
a really pretty palette there are 16
shades it retails for 38 99 for looking
at the pictures it looks like this is a
very similar type of situation - Juvia
splays like it's more indie but a little
bit more professional than like some
indie brands very good pricing for
really pigmented stuff and I don't see
anyone talking about it so I don't know
why but I think it looks like you're
really pretty palette I love that
there's some color to it it's definitely
still neutral and wearable though really
really cool I might try that out just go
to haven't heard anyone talk about it
and I think that would be really cool to
just try it a new fun brand I really
want people to talk about new stuff new
brands like it's so fun when julius
place you know became a new big thing
but like we can keep doing that guys
there's a ton of brands let's spread the
love let's apply some cool new makeup
anyway last I wanted to talk about the
lorac unzipped palette now if you guys
thought I just clutter series with my
palette then you guys know I declutter
the original unzipped and the unzipped
gold the formula goes just wasn't
getting it for me they weren't my
favorite I really never used the gold
one and then the regular unzipped I did
enjoy but it just wasn't colorful enough
for me I definitely like a little more
color I know look very simple today but
if I'm going to do something I usually
like to do it a little bit a little bit
more than that palates given me so
anyway they came out with three new
palates all inspired by the sunset in
California and different places I
believe that's the inspo so they have
the mountain sunset desert content and
ocean sunset these retail for forty two
dollars and they look really pretty I
think there's something interesting
about them definitely something that's
intriguing I'm not sure if I'm going to
purchase one if I get him at a discount
at the beauty supply I might be more
willing to do it
I would really need to swatch them
though because another reason I didn't
like the original runs of palettes was
the formula
I love the pro formula from lorac so I
don't know I would definitely need to
swatch it and really get a feel from see
how they work but I think it's really
cool something inspired there seems to
be a little bit of color differentiation
some different color combos being put
together but it's still overall neutral
definitely something wearable I think a
lot of people could get some good use
out of it I will mention here is like a
bonus item I saw that Laura is coming
out with the mega Pro 4 for Christmas oh
I'm not into it I'm pretty sure I'm not
going to buy it it kind of hurts my soul
to say that since I have every single
one of them but I'm just not feeling it
like it's just boring gross to me if you
feel differently that's awesome because
I kind of wish I did but I probably
won't be picking that one up because
it's just too much money for the same
shades I don't know I'm not feeling it I
love the pink packaging I like that's
the best part about it to me which is
not enough that is everything I'm so
sorry this one was all over the place in
such a mess but I just couldn't be
bothered to refill I'm so sorry I felt
like a horrible youtuber but it's just
me being honest and true with y'all
don't forget that if you like this video
there's a whole playlist to check those
out and that's everything there's dog
bites going on and I will see you later
