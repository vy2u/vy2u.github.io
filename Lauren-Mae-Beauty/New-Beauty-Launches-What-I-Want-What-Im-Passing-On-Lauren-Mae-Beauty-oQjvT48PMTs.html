Lauren I wanted to start a new type of
video on my channel this is kind of a
mix between an anti haul and also my
temptations video I only filmed one of
them I will leave it linked down below
but you guys are really interested in
that and I thought since this is my
channel and you watch people to see what
they think why they think that I thought
this would be interesting although I
don't own any of these products and I
don't know about formula and I haven't
watched them or anything like that I
thought I would let you guys know what I
thought on new products that are being
dropped in the beauty community whether
I thought that they were worth my money
or not if I was interested what the pros
and cons were to me from just seeing the
products and like looking into them I
hope that will be interesting for you
this in no way is meant to like make you
feel bad if it's something you do want
and I don't I'm just thinking of it from
my own perspective I'm a makeup artist
and I do like having a big collection
but something that's really important to
me is if a product is inspiring
something that's maybe a little bit
different to my collection or that I
just truly love because I love the
formula or something like that those are
things that are important to me and that
will make something more attractive and
want me to buy it everyone has different
needs and wants in their makeup so just
because I don't want it doesn't mean
it's bad or that I like hate you or I
think you're stupid at all we're all
different so these are just my thoughts
and hopefully you want to hear them
let's just get into it let's start off
with two faced a lot of holiday stuff is
dropping so a lot of this is holiday but
two-face is doing their kind of
traditional holiday grand palettes so
the first one is the Grand Hotel cafe
this is a set that has three pallets as
well as a mini mascara overall it has 18
eyes shadows 3 face products and it
retails for $49 to me kind of how it is
with like all to face stuff this is
something we've seen before so I don't
think that's necessarily bad I think
there's a place for these pallets
because let's face it not everyone is
obsessed with makeup like we all are on
YouTube so these pallets to me have a
perfect place as gifts for people who
maybe don't treat themselves to makeup
all the time and want something that's
high-end or to face it's super cute you
know they're gonna be so excited to get
something like this I feel like these
holiday palettes maybe they don't have
the same quality as their normal eye
shadows and they're like permanent range
but I do think
they're definitely better eyeshadows and
the drugstore might have and definitely
cuter packaging so I think there's a
place for these pallets but I just don't
think it's for the people who have
everything already you already have this
you have last year's in the year before
and they're all the same a lot of these
pallets come in like neutral colors
which again we all have
I know neutrals are what most people
like and what most people wear the most
often but to me it's just not worth the
price to get a mini mascara of something
I've already tried and just more the
same eyeshadow as I already own although
the packaging is cute it kind of goes
the same way for the chocolate shop
palette to me this is the Sephora
exclusive palette and it's kind of like
their larger palette and gift set it
comes with three minis and it also comes
with that huge eyeshadow palette I think
it has 21 shadows and some face products
in it again this is just like the bigger
batter palette than the one before and
it would just be a great gift for
friends or family who don't already have
a lot of makeup and that palette retails
for $58 and I just wanted to say really
fast - is I have nothing against like to
face I love like their packaging all
these things this is the Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette and it's
one of my favorite palettes it's what I
used on my eyes today and I just love it
but to me when I look at this I'm just
inspired and excited to use it and
that's why that's just what I'm looking
for just to give you an example like
something that for me personally is
exciting and new and even if I might
have colors like it already just the way
they put them together and the palette
is exciting or just makes me excited to
be creative with my makeup so just want
to throw that in there I also thought I
would mention that you face does a lot
of these little kits that have like
blushes and lip products in it around
the holidays and I think that those are
a better bang for your buck if you were
interested in trying maybe the blush
formula or their melted lipsticks
formula I think they're even doing one
with the melted like liquid matte ones
that they came out with more recently I
think those are great because you're
getting a lot of product a lot of
different variety for less money than
you would if you had to buy them all in
the full-size I know that you are
getting less product obviously than the
full-size but how many of us honestly go
through those lip products no one you're
onto the next thing so I think it's a
great way to try out a lot from a brand
without paying as much for it last thing
I'm
talk about with to face is their
collaboration with nikkietutorials I
like nikkietutorials
and I've seen good reviews bad reviews
things in the middle for me personally
even if the quality of this palette is
amazing it's just not quite to the level
I want it to be it's just kind of in the
middle I think that a lot of people
would enjoy this palette but to me it
just needs to have a little bit more to
it I love that she included a lot of
face products in it because it does make
it more of like a complete palette and
you could do so much with it
again if you didn't have a huge
collection you're getting a lot of
things in there another thing I really
liked is that it came with so many
different side products so it had the
full-size liner which is so smart if two
faced foot in there because two
brand-new liner and it's a way to like
get it out there for people and for
people to try it without having to pay
$20 for it again I haven't heard that
it's the best formula but it's nice to
be able to try that out I think it's a
good side item I also like that it came
with the glitter that's really nice and
the purple mascara which is something a
little bit different than just the plain
black I do wish that the shadow
insurance was the glitter glue instead I
think it would just go nicely with the
glitter eyeshadow and make that loose
pigment a little bit more wearable for
everyone on the daily without the
fallout overall I just kind of didn't
think that it was like a hundred percent
Nicki when I look at that just a little
too boring for what I already have in my
collection personally let's move on
let's talk about Joseph's colors they
came out with their ice cream palette
and I remember seeing a teaser of this
on Instagram and was so excited it has
ten shades and it retails for $50 I
really want to get this palette I think
it's really cute I think that the
packaging is not only cute but I like
the colors inside I think it's a good
mix of mattes and shimmers neutrals and
colors and when I look at it I'm just
like excited to do something different
with my makeup I think that I probably
could do a lot of the shades in my
collection but just the overall feeling
I go with that palette I'm just excited
for it so that is something that I
personally want to look into and I
probably or potentially will buy there's
a few things from Urban Decay that I
wanted to talk about so the first one is
the moon dust a shadow palette I am on
the fence about this there's a part of
me that loves glitter loves color hello
look at my inner corners like I love
glitter and I think it's so cool that
they decide
to put this in a pallet it's such a
better value than if you're buying them
individually I have four of them
individually that I paid for as
individual shadows and I spent way more
money on these than I would if I bought
that pallet so to me in that regard I
think it's a really great deal but
something that just comes along with the
territory and the shadows is that
there's a lot of litter so there's gonna
probably some fallout they're a little
bit finicky and I find that the
pigmentation of them doesn't always
transfer over and you just have to work
harder with these shadows even these
ones I still have to work with and I
don't use them all the time because of
that and so I feel like buying a whole
pallet with all those formulas in it is
definitely kind of like will I use it I
did see a review that said that the
shadows in the pallet aren't the same
formula as the individuals which is
another reason that's kind of like oh
that's disappointing this ballad I think
just takes a lot of work and you just
have to be a certain individual and kind
of tell yourself that you're going to
use it if not I just don't think it's
worth it but I do think it's an awesome
idea and I like that I like that it's
something different and new so you guys
know that it's also like a 10 I shadow
palette and it retails for $50 that one
I'm just on the fence on maybe maybe not
the next palette I wanted to talk about
with the urban decay naked ultimate
basics palette when I first saw shots of
this I was super excited about it and
then the more I saw it the more I
realized that mmm that's what it is it's
just basic I know that's the point of it
it's all matte shadows twelve of them
and the palette retails for $54 but in
my collection again I just don't feel
like I needed I think it's really trendy
because it has some of those warmer
shades in it and I know a lot of people
are really gonna like that but I have a
lot of those shades already and it just
doesn't warrant buying a full pallet
full of so many shades for $54 I think
the price on it it's a little hefty I
don't know I just feel like Urban
Decay's prices sometimes are really high
and it's because of the name it's
because of the Naked name and I don't
know I'm just personally not feeling it
I think if you love your Naked basics
and use it all the time it's probably
gonna be a great buy for you if you
don't have a lot of matte shades and
you're looking for something that has a
ton it's gonna be a great buy for you I
think that someone who collects the
naked palettes will also love it but I
just don't think I'm gonna get the use
out of it that I would need to for it to
cost $54 and for me to buy it something
that I was actually
in the with the Weisse lipstick palette
this is a 12 pan lipstick palette that
retails for $35 I believe there are two
versions there are a couple shades that
lap over into each palette but I think
that this is a really awesome deal I'm
looking at it as a makeup artist and I
already spend the time to deep pot
lipsticks from tubes into palettes oh
this is so awesome that's already in a
palette the packaging is gonna be
beautiful because it's Urban Decay and I
don't feel like the price is that
expensive $35 that's like one like
designer lipstick you get a lot of
shades a lot of options not all the
colors are things I would use like on a
normal job so that's something to keep
in mind but I just think it's like
interesting and new and different and
price wise I think really good again
you're getting so much for your money
the biggest thing for like people who
aren't going to be doing makeup on other
people is the fact that it's in a
palette you might not be used to using
like a lip brush or things like that and
for that reason you might not get your
money's worth out of it because it just
gets left behind or it's just
inconvenient so that's just something to
keep in mind but I think this is
definitely interesting and I'm
definitely looking into it next tart
I feel like Tarte is like two-phase they
have a lot of holiday stuff they have
like their whole packaging and theme and
all that for holiday so I believe the
big kit at least for Sephora is the
pretty paint box case this has four face
products 24 eyeshadows and three
different minis and it retails for $59
this is the same case to me as the Too
Faced if you aren't into makeup that
much you don't treat yourself at often
and you don't have a lot of stuff any
love neutrals
you'll love this you get to try so much
get so many different options for a
relatively good price if you were to buy
this all individually if you have a huge
collection you already have all this you
have the tartlet palette you have the in
bloom palette you have the rainforest of
the sea palettes you have it all you
have last year's palette so I just don't
think that you just need to repeat that
much stuff for the price and if you're
like looking into the mascara or the
tardis lip paint or something like that
the minis just buy a full-size of that
and be done with it instead of spending
$60 obviously that's just like my
personal opinion I think the packaging
too is just like a little
feel like it looks grand and extravagant
and again it's a great gift in that way
but if you're thinking about storing it
with all your other makeup it's
sometimes bulky and sometimes just like
a little ugly honestly next let's talk
about the Tarte cheek palette this is a
10 blush and highlighting app and
palette and it retails for $44 I'm
excited for this I will say that I'm
partial to the Tarte blushes I've bought
like all the little mini blushes from
like three years back I just really like
them and I like their formula plus I
feel like they changed the formula so
they're not as hard and don't get hard
pan is easy but I just think that the
price on it is so good for how many
different colors you're getting and
again I'm looking at it as a makeup
artist I can put this in my kit and have
so many different options anything I
would need I don't need to pack any
other blushes and for $44 like that's so
good that less than five dollars a blush
that's pretty dang good definitely
something I'm looking into I think the
packaging obviously I haven't seen it in
person but I don't know how thick it's
gonna be but I'm hoping that it's not
too bulky either it doesn't have like
the zipper and it's not like that
ugly palette a couple years ago with
like the bigger pants that we all didn't
like so that's something that I'm
excited about and I most likely will get
and last I wanted to touch on again the
lip products I am obviously a pallet
girl so that's why a lot of these are
pallets because that's what I'm most
interested in but I do think that the
lip set is really awesome so it has five
lip crayons in it and five of the tardis
lip paints I don't know how much it
retails for so I'll leave it listed
somewhere on the screen but again this
is a great way to try out a lot of
different products in the range these
are like relatively new to tarts lines
if you haven't already bought a ton of
them you can kind of see how they are
see what the different colors are like
and know if you wanted to purchase them
again you don't go through Tunnel lip
product no matter how much you want to
say you do oh I don't think that there
will be an issue if you like using them
up and not getting your money's worth
that way and if you really do use one up
just go repurchase it I think these are
permanent
if not I'll leave like something saying
they're not I just thought that was a
great way again for my kid I thought
it'd be nice to have the different lip
liners I will say that I did hear about
review on the lip liner that I was like
really dry and like breaking so like I
said at the beginning I don't know how
these formulas are I haven't watched
them and
that would also be something I take into
account before like actually purchasing
unless I'm buying online assuming the
formula is good I think this is just a
really great kit to try a lot out for a
little bit of money okay let's keep
going guys trekking through the next one
is the Kat Von D metal matte palette I
was so excited to hear about this
palette I remember seeing her like
drawing out the logo for it and that
made me so excited I will say when I
first saw it I was kind of like Oh a
little disappointed I just felt like do
I need this palette and the more I look
at it the more I'm like yeah I'm gonna
get it I kind of feel like I'll regret
it if I don't I know what's gonna sell
out and be gone pretty fast Kat Von D
stuff you really does and I'm not like
following about it if you're missing out
if you don't know what that means like
because of everyone else
I just know myself and I know that I
really do like her shadows and her
formula
I think her packaging is really
beautiful and I do think I'll get you
some of it one of the things that I
really like about it is it's 21 shades
again there's metallic shades and matte
shades so you can do a lot of different
things with it compared to the Urban
Decay this is 21 for $60 and their
ultimate Naked basics has 12 for 54 so
for six more dollars I'm getting so much
more color so much more to me creativity
but still getting mattes I just think
like that's what I'm talking about for
value I don't know how many grams are in
each one but honestly how many of you
guys have used up an entire eyeshadow
without trying exactly not many of you
guys so I don't think that that's
necessarily something that you should be
concerned about like oh it's limited
edition but you know I want to
repurchase this there was always gonna
be a new next thing that you love so I
don't concern myself with sizes I'd
rather get less and try a lot more
personally for the most part obviously
there's different situations but for the
most part next is the hourglass ambient
lighting edit palette this is a real
light one this is really beautiful
packaging although I have heard and it
feels cheap and that it's not as good of
quality I feel like there are always
some like controversy around the
hourglass palettes because they are a
small amount of product compared to like
the full size and I think even compared
to the first like palette that they did
if you're someone who really was
wanting to look at some hourglass
products haven't bought anything yet I
think this would be a great way to try
out a lot from the brand again assuming
it's the same formula as the full-size
product this retails for $80 you get an
ambient lighting face powder a bronzer
two blushes and one of the highlighters
to try out that's a lot of different
things from the range a lot of things
that are really popular in their range
so I think that if it's something you're
really wanting it might be a good deal
even though it's pricey and even though
the pans are small that way you can kind
of see what you like and if you use it
all up you know you love it and you can
buy the full size
next is the Laura Mercier highlighter
palette this palette just looking at it
it's beautiful I was already sucked in
once by this palette I have the
highlighter in indiscretion
now the palette itself is limited
edition but the colors inside are not
they are permanent so that's something
to keep in mind
I think this palette would be worth it
if you know you're gonna use at least
two of the shades on yourself on a daily
basis or more regularly because it is
$58 on these I think retail for like 30
something or high 30s into the 40's so
if that's the case I think it's worth it
in that regard but if you know you're
only going to use one color just get the
one I think that there's no reason to
have the whole palette I personally
again as a makeup artist I'm looking
into it for my kit but it's just a
luxury item I don't need it I have the
Anasazi blow kits and I really like
those I just think that they're so
pretty so I really don't feel like I've
used this enough though to really
justify that one so that one is mostly
just like the pretty packaging and the
way it looks plus I do get a discount on
it so all those things combined to kind
of make me want to get it but we'll see
I'm still in the funds I wanted to talk
about the Becca pressed skin Perfector
in rose quartz I think that this one it
looks really pretty I think it's nice
that it's a rose a light like pink shade
because we always see champagnes and
golds and peaches and it's just nice to
see something a little bit different I
mean it's not that different don't get
me wrong but it's just not quite as
common as the other ones the packaging
is absolutely beautiful but the one
thing I don't like is that it has 7
grams in it instead of 8 grams this is a
limited edition one I got in the past
this is rose gold and it has that same
kind of like pressed imprint on it and
so I know that they can make this an 8
gram
because this is eight gram I don't know
why they're trying to gyp you on one
gram but keep the price the same I don't
know if it's for the beautiful packaging
because it is different looking but
that's just something that it's like
it's already so expensive and I know
that most of us aren't going to go
through a whole highlighter but it's
just kind of the principle of it that I
don't like but yeah I'm kind of on the
fence about that one I don't need it but
it is something I'm interested in let's
talk about Bobby Brown I think this is
my last yeah my last two things are
Bobby Brown so the first one I want to
talk about was the shimmer brick palette
I've never seen Bobby Brown do a shimmer
brick palette I don't know any shimmer
bricks but they've been so raved about
so I thought this was kind of just
interesting to see and like to see the
colors there's three of them in there
there's a gold one a bronze one and then
one called wild rose when I went on
safaris website the only one I saw on
there was bronze but when I looked at it
it looked different than the bronze in
the photo for the palette and it also
looked different than the one in the
travel size bronze like the photos all
look different so I don't know if it's
the same exact one or if it's just like
bad lighting where they all look
different but they're the same that
being said I'm kind of on the fence
about it I don't need this product at
all I don't know how much you said get
out of it but it's just the fact that
they're all together and it is a pretty
good deal again I can get a discount so
if I can it'll push me a little bit more
but it's just kind of interesting to me
and I thought it was just something new
and exciting and I can see why people
might want to get this none of these
though are like light enough to really
only use this highlighter so to me it's
kind of like the colors are a little
strange so I definitely would have to
like figure out how I think I'm gonna
use them swatch them really like get
into that palette before I purchased it
and that retails for $69 too so it is
quite pricy the last thing from Bobby
Brown that I want to talk about with
something I saw on sports website this
is the 25th anniversary book of neutrals
no the 25th anniversary nude library
eyeshadow palette has 40 different
eyeshadows which is amazing and it costs
$200.00 lots of money personally to me
my experience with bobby brown
eyeshadows has not been good I bought
one of the palettes before it was like
$70 I was so excited it was nude it just
did not perform well honestly I feel
like it performs like a luxury brand
eyeshadow usually performs they don't
have the craziest amount of pigmentation
yes they're beautiful they're just more
like everyday wear
you can kind of slap them on you don't
have to worry about blending them out
too much because there's not that much
to blend out I don't know if it's
different for this palette I haven't
swatched it obviously but that's just
like from my personal experience in the
past and how much money it is I just
would rather buy the Natasha - no no
palette if I'm gonna like shell up some
money for eyeshadow I definitely would
try that I'm more excited about that so
that's just kind of how I feel about it
if you love a Bobbi Brown eyeshadows you
might already even have all of them I
don't know if these are in the permanent
collection again they're all just
neutrals - so to me there's just like me
for that much money it's definitely a
meat to me that's everything guys I hope
you enjoyed this video I know it's gonna
be kind of long I will try to edit it
down let me know if there's any products
you want me to talk about that I didn't
down below let me have you even like to
type a video and you want me to do
another one
and again I hope this was just like fun
to you to just know my opinions I love
knowing why someone else wants to buy
something or why they don't so hopefully
you do too that's everything I'm gonna
let you guys go and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
