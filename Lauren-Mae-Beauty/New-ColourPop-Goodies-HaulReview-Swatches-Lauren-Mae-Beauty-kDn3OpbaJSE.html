Lauren thank you so much for watching
this is going to be a haul of all the
new colour-pop stuff I got this is
including things from their recent
launch of the yes please palette I also
some of their new $10 magnetic I shadow
palettes that are just empty as well
just some other stuff so I'm excited to
show you what I got what I think of it
I've had it for a little bit so this
will kind of be a haul and a review of
these products and that's kind of
everything so let's get into the hall
I'm just going to start off with the yes
please palette because I feel like it
was the most like highly anticipated
thing that's come out recently this is
what the packaging look like this was
just the box
I do have swatches on my Instagram if
you want to check it out I did them in
natural daylight it's like three
different things it shows the packaging
the palette and then swatches on my hand
I'll do a few swatches here but I don't
I heard there's a lot of videos on this
you don't like me at a time I think
review is just better anyway super cute
packaging this is smaller than like a
typical palette this is like my Z
palette and then this is the color pop
solid so as you can tell it is if it's
smaller than that
I wasn't sure when I ordered it if it
was going to be smaller or not but I
think that the packaging and the size of
it is so cute and tiny it's cute AF man
now this is what the palette looks like
as you guys know this is being called
like a dupe for the Natasha generic
sunset palette now I don't have that
palette I can't tell you exactly
I know kathleenlights to the comparison
and Jake aside to the comparison so if
you want to check those videos out I'll
leave them linked down below if you want
to know how they kind of match up
personally I do think this was very much
inspired by that palette I don't think
everything is exact but I think these
are really really awesome
it obviously is a warm tones palette to
have some really great shades in it I
believe everything in it is new except
for two of the colors which I know one
of them is this one full zip and I don't
know off the top of my head what the
other one is I think note to self so if
you have a lot of color pop shadows
you're not going to get a ton of repeats
and if you don't have a lot of color
clock shadows you can get ton of new
cool shapes I really like this palette
this is in my favorites video I've
really enjoyed using it I used it on set
as well one of my favorite colors in
here is this yellow one it is very very
pigmented I know that doesn't seem very
pigmented but for a yellow that is
amazing
and like I mentioned in my favourites
video I did order B color Tiki which I
will be showing you in a second and they
wanted that because it was like a more
matte yellow color I love yellows I
think they're really cool but it's not
nearly as good as the one in this
palette so I don't even suggest you
buying Tiki it's not that good I also
really like this shade here as a nice
transition it reminds me of a nostalgia
orange soda there's a swatch it's really
nice and bright and then my other
favorite color from the palette that I
wasn't expecting is this really dark
brown it's very pigmented and I'm
usually not into super dark colors but
something about this one is just so
pretty on the eyes it has this like red
burgundy undertone to it which just
looks really awesome in the outer corner
it just gives you something a little bit
deeper and smoky but just not face it
pigmentation wise I find that these are
very similar to their color pop regular
shadow I've heard that things are like
better I think that they're pretty much
the same so if you like that formula you
will most likely like these as well
these are powdery they kick up powder
when you swatch them they're going to be
powdery I find that they blend
beautifully on the eye though I know a
lot of people are into like swatches and
brush swatches and how they swatch but I
truly don't think that swatches are
everything it can give you an idea
definitely but sometimes if something
looks a little bit more sheer in a
swatch it can look beautiful on the eye
and build up really nice so it's just
all about how it actually performs on
the eyeball a negative that I know a lot
of people are going to hate and even I
am not the biggest fan of because you
know it does suck but this packaging
it's just cardboard packaging which I
like cardboard packaging I like that
it's small and slim and like doesn't
take up a ton of room I don't need like
bougie packaging you know whatever this
is $16 so I'm not even expecting that
this does almost feel rubberized like I
don't know if it is or not but that
makes this really hard to clean and
since it is a light gray again anything
you get on this is going to be so dirty
if you can see on the top of my palette
there the shadow since they are very
dusty can get on this top lid and onto
the outer packaging and it's going to
look dirty so if you're someone who
wants your makeup to look pristine like
you've never touched it this is probably
going to irritate the crap out of you
I'm not too big on that I'm fine with my
stuff looking left and used it's about
using the product to me so if it's not
like perfect looking it's like yeah
that's makeup so it's not a big deal to
me but I know that it's a huge issue for
a lot of people so keep that in mind
other than that though I do suggested
they are going to be restocking this on
d7 I will leave a link to the Instagram
post so you can check it out they're
also going to be releasing some really
cool setting sprays some liquid
highlighters and some lip balms if you
want to check that out on the same day I
might pick up the settings phrase I
don't know we'll see anyway I love this
palette I think it's really nice I do
highly suggest it and it's great
next I wanted to talk about the $10
empty magnetic pallets that they just
released these whole 24 shadows
perfectly which is something that was
really awesome I love the price point of
$10 and that's great this isn't the same
packaging as the other pallet so the
same issues with it being kind of
rubberized then getting really dirty you
might not be able to tell on camera with
the lights but these look really dingy
already so that is definitely something
to keep in mind this is what it looks
like inside you can view four rows four
rows of six to get 24 in here I love
that these fit them perfectly it's just
such a great price I will be buying
these to keep my color pop shadows in I
think that they're just really nice and
I will continue to buy them now with the
palette I did decide to pick up some
shadows they had a sale going on where
they were four dollars apiece instead of
five I did get this palette with them I
think I just picked up one because I
knew I wasn't going to like want it but
this does come with your shadows if you
buy four at a time you get a little
palette I don't personally like these I
think they're bulky for just having four
single eyeshadows in them I know you can
take out like the foam and like have a
small little palette but I feel like why
do that when you got these so I will
probably just be like getting rid of
that giving it away to someone I don't
even know anyway back to these shadows I
did pick up quite a few from the new
summer 2017 lines they have some really
pretty shades I am really sad I kind of
wish I picked up just the entire
collection even those blooms they have
some like kind of just basic champagne
type of shades and I just I'm so
impressed by the shadows that I wish I
got more of them so I will go one by one
and show you swatches of these but just
an overall review I highly suggest them
te is not my favorite it's just a little
powdery for
it doesn't give you as much I don't know
it's just not there's the woman's palate
to me I would just go with something
group postal signs over this one
personally high-strung has to be
probably one of my favorites its cell
metallic and so beautiful I just highly
suggest that shade it kind of looks like
weeny the color pop super shock shadows
that Kaplan lights came out with I also
really like Beach Blanket and bel-air
and sea stars yeah I did those alright I
think these are really pretty brown
colors I've used beach blanket all over
my lid in the videos where I have like
that blue in our corner I just think
it's a really pretty color it reminds me
of pumpkin pie by Coastal Scents
I'm just highly highly impressed I will
continue to buy their shadows and love
them so I am very very happy with these
and I will show you you swatches and now
Oh
and just to show you what's in my other
one these are my other color pop shadows
that I own I got these from the
Valentine's Day collection most of them
except for paper tiger here and I just
get rid of a few shadows because they
just were too glittery for me and I'm
not into it so yeah I don't suggest
those ones whichever ones they were I
don't know what they are off the top -
and then while I was on a site I decided
to pick up a couple other things now
there's a reason for that one I just
wanted to but - they did not release the
magnetic palette at the same time as the
pre-made palette which is very
frustrating because they were supposed
to so I bought the pre-made palette and
put enough stuff in my cart to get free
shipping and then waited until the
magnetic pallets popped up which was
about 15 minutes I feel like late
because the other pellet sold out in 10
minutes it was so fast so I did that
just to make sure I got the palette but
that was kind of irritating because I
would have just bought like one order
and probably wouldn't have ended up with
all of this but I'm tough to get their
crap together on that because that's
pretty plain anyway all the products
that got her lip products except for
this this is the color pop brow pencil
in the color dope - I decided to go with
the taupe because I knew it was going to
be more cool toned instead of like the
blonde which potentially could be more
warm I have this in my brows today and
the outer half I have been enjoying this
I think it's nice the spoolie is really
good it's a nice thin pencil it's very
similar to the Maybelline define the
brow it's also similar to the clinic one
that I've used before this fully on this
though is better than both of those for
five dollars I don't mind it I think
it's nice I would repurchase this again
I've enjoyed doing my brows with a
little bit more precision at the tail
because this is a lot smaller than the
get brow pencil from elf for lip
products I ordered three things and then
these two came for free these are just
like their Lola piece that's what they
call them Lola piece so I got the color
thistle and gold digger you just got
these for free you could add a mantra
purchase though I'm not going to say no
to free stuff I'm not a fan of these
colors I will be I don't know what I'm
going to do I might be posses into my
lip palette the darker one here is gold
digger which is one that I prefer more
but it's just these are my favorite
formula personally I I feel like they
feel thick on the lips I do have some
lippy pencils that I like but I'm not
sure I'm not sure I feel about these so
I decided to pick up one of these
blotted lip colors this one is in the
color DejaVu and it is a part of some
type of collection
Alexis Wren and color pop don't know who
that is but this color just looked
really pretty I love the whole idea of
the blotted lip is something that isn't
quite as a pick it's more like a
spinning it looks like you've been
having popsicles like I like that you
guys know I'm not super into really
opaque like just crap all over your lips
that is a swatch of it there and that is
me like running over it a million times
you don't expect it to be as sheer as it
is when you look at it in the tube but
just go on quite again sheer and and I
really do like that I love this lip
color the formula on it can be a little
bit drying I definitely am still into it
and interested to try it I think this
would be so pretty with some brighter
colors like a nice hot pink maybe
something a little bit more orange e and
just really fun for summer it has a
little bit of a sheen on it but I do
find that the more wear it it's just
kind of matte on the lips I do like this
I'm still kind of deciding how much I
like it but I don't hate it
is that good I don't know for a lip
product and me that's really good it
takes a lot for a lip product and me to
like it together and like each other
which doesn't even make sense because I
like simple lips but that's just the way
it is and last I decided to pick up some
lip glosses because I really love the
lip gloss and finders-keepers it's one
of my favorite lip products I bought
that for free from them because they
were likely on shipping these stuff so
if you're that in and I
it's such a beautiful color it's in my
top lip products I'll leave that video
link down let's go check it out but I am
very very disappointed with these it
feels so pretty right like oh we got
some cute nude babies no this one is the
color bestie and it's just a little bit
too warm for me it's more pink than I
thought it was going to be I know that
these are very opaque which is something
I like about these glasses but this
formula is a little bit more sticky than
the other one it's a little bit thicker
the doe foot applicator is different
than in the other lipgloss that I have
so I just feel like I got duped me
something because it's just different
it's just a different product this one
here is the color curvy from the Isle of
Surrey I love Sarah II I don't know how
to say her name I don't really know her
but this color was just so pretty I
thought I'm going to get a really nice
like you know nude color and this could
be ooh
some fell out onto my leg um this could
be my fault because again I do know
these are opaque formulas and maybe I
just wanted this in a bit of a sheer
formula
it just doesn't look very good on my
lips I feel like it looks kind of chalky
on the lips they not coat evenly and
like stay even I feel like they bunch up
I just not a fan again this has that
different doe foot applicator which I
don't like it's a thicker formula it's
not insanely sticky but it's just not as
liquidy as the other one that I have so
yeah I don't know if I'm going to get
any more lip glosses I'm just scared if
you have a favorite lip gloss let me
know and maybe next time I'll try one
more I'm also going to try to go a
little bit more cool toned I find that I
just don't like something that pulls too
orange on me doesn't look good I'm not
saying that these are horrible
they just weren't what I was expecting
compared to the other gloss that I had
and that was discipline plus I just
don't feel like they look that great on
my lips so yeah it's a little
disappointing to have picked these up
hoping they were going to be so good and
they just didn't really work for me
alright guys that's everything for my
haul and review of these new color puff
items that I got let me know what you
picked up recently what some of your
favorites are if you think I should try
them out if you think I'll really love
them also let me know if you're excited
about some of the new releases I love
that they're branching out and doing
other things and they're still keeping
the price
portable which is something that I can
appreciate and I will see you in my next
video okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
