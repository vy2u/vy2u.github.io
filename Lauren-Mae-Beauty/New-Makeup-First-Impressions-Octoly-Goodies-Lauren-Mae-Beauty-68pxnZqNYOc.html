Lauren today I'm going to be doing kind
of a first impression we're test demo
review on a bunch of products i got from
actually i have three different things
here to show you guys they're all like
makeup related so I thought it'd be fun
to kind of put them into a tutorial talk
about them and share my thoughts with
you guys so these are the three products
I have to test out today the first one
here is one of the newer sponges from
Real Techniques I was really interested
in trying this so I was excited that I
got accepted to try the sponge obviously
the shape is quite different this is
supposed to help with like contouring
and highlighting that's like a big claim
of it but also just in general blending
and stuff since it is a sponge and mine
is what right now I have never used this
this will be like a first impressions on
this the next product I have here is a
foundation this is a crane foundation
from vivillon and that is like a mix of
the owners daughters names which he
thought was really cool I was excited to
try a creme compact foundation because i
personally like them i feel like they
don't get enough love I just used them a
lot in my kid so I was excited to try
this for myself I have tried this a
couple times mostly because I couldn't
wait and I just wanted to try it out but
I will be demoing this and tell you guys
my thoughts and I will be showing you
how I makeup looks throughout the day
and do check ups so you guys can see it
and the last product here let's do it
the right way and the last product here
is the Mallee ultimate performance see
the light concealer so this is a
concealer for under the eyes for the
most part i believe i did watch the
little video on octa lee about this it
was like being used as almost like a way
to bake the under eye without actually
using like powders and baking it but
getting that same kind of like lifted
concealed perfected look so I am
interested to try this I have not tried
it on my skin yet but I have likes
watched it and it's quite thick so we'll
see how that works out I'm really hoping
that the sponge will be a really nice
way to blend this into the skin so to
start out my face is completely clean I
did like wash it and exfoliate and put
moisturizer on for a primer today I did
already use a little bit of my Smashbox
par minimizing primer just in the areas
where I need it the most and i press
this into the skin and then for primer
all over
Faison gonna be using the Becca ever
matte poreless primer Perfector when I
wore the foundation yesterday I used
this and I did like the way it sat on
top of it I didn't feel like by the end
of the day I had that like gross cakey
feeling so I want to like retry that out
again today but with the Smashbox primer
underneath which I didn't do yesterday I
mean when I know he chose use like a pea
sized I use quite a bit and I just try
to get it in really fast well it does
not mix well with my eye cream now that
I have the primer on I am going to go in
with the foundation so again it's going
to be the creme compact this is in the
shade medium light number one it has a
yellow undertone I do believe this is
the lightest color of the foundation
though you can pick a yellow or pink
undertone I feel like the compact is
really sturdy itself I really like that
about it it came with this sponge the
first time I tried this foundation I use
a sponge and I did not like the way that
applied at all I thought I would like
that because I feel like cream
foundations apply well with sponges but
specifically this ones that came with it
I didn't like it has like a little cover
case it's not airtight but it just kind
of like protects it and keeps your
sponge out of the product if you're
gonna use it I have used it with a
Beauty Blender as well and I do like
that method for like building up
coverage but I've really been liking the
least amount of product on my face with
the most coverage so I am going to be
using a brush today this is the Real
Techniques buffing brush or expert face
brush or something and I'm just going
straight into the product and I'm going
to just be kind of smoothing that on my
face I do wish this came in a fair color
and had just more color options in
general because there are people that
are lighter than me and would need a
lighter foundation so I'm just gonna do
one side of the Taoiseach so we can see
the difference and i am going to i think
like if there's a couple places that
need a little more coverage i'm just
going to use the sponge to kind of DAB
on those areas and I'm getting kind of a
mix of buffing and padding with my brush
just depending on the area this does
have kind of a smell to it that I don't
like but over all the times that I've
used this I have really liked my
foundation and I've really been enjoying
it I wore it on set one day I just did
like a commercial
shoot and I was on set for 10 hours so I
had it on probably for good 15 ish hours
it was breaking down by the end of the
day but I'm sorry I don't expect a
foundation to last like 15 full hours
without like any touch-ups and be like
amazing looking so I I really did think
that this looked good okay so this is
one side of it I feel like the color
match is really good for me specifically
I don't feel like it's too light I feel
like it pretty much blends into my
actual skin um I like that it has the
yellow undertone I wouldn't say that it
goes on the skin and just doesn't look
like makeup like a hundred percent but I
don't feel like it looks like super
cakey or gross or anything like that you
know what I mean like it doesn't look
like caked up makeup but it's not like a
finish that looks like your skin if that
makes sense I'm just going to finish
applying this to the rest of my face and
I'm just going through and when I
smoothing out with my fingers it is no
I'm not like the biggest fan of a brush
application so i just like to kind of
use the warmth of my fingers to kind of
meld it into the skin a little bit more
now that i've applied to all over my
face I'm gonna go with the sponge and
just kind of add some extra coverage if
I can to places where I have just some
spots so I have a few places on my chin
I don't know if they're like picking up
on camera though which I'm not
complaining about i'm also i have a few
scars over here so I'm just kind of
packing that on and I do feel like you
can really build up coverage this way
and then I think I'm just going to kind
of blend over the rest of my face just
to kind of get a nice finish on the skin
so far with the sponge it's okay i like
using this side the bigger side I don't
know how I'm gonna feel about using the
smaller side I don't know I feel like
the shape is just weird to be weird and
I feel like I could maybe still get all
the use out of normal sponges I don't
know okay we're done with foundation
let's go on to concealer so this is
again that malli one the color on this
is the color light again I believe that
is the lightest shade which
not sure if I think this should be the
light shade again I think there should
be another shade down from this just to
give you an idea like this is some thick
concealer that kind of scares me like
that there's so much of it I'm trying to
like warm it up on the back of my hand
and it is getting a little bit more
running which i think is nice I'm gonna
apply this with my finger first to my
under eye and I'm going kind of heavy
because i feel like i don't know it's
very yellow um not very light to me i'm
going to be using this bunch to blend
that in we'll see how this goes i feel
like this is just a heavy concealer i'm
not sure how i like it i feel like if
her inspiration for this was drag queens
that it makes sense because this is like
super thick um I don't know if I'm
liking this I'm not sure how i like it i
think 1 i'm not really enjoying it blend
it out with this sponge because i just
don't understand how i would the only
side i can use is this flat side that i
really like but it doesn't have like a
nice pointed tip like even the other
Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge or the Beauty Blender which is my
favorite so that's it like blended out I
definitely see like in the monitor this
is more like bright and kind of
perfected although again it is quite
yellow so we'll see how that looks
throughout the day I'm going to apply to
the other side and blend that out I mean
maybe I shouldn't use this much that's
probably a issue no but I'm also going
to use this to kind of like go around my
face because that's what I would do with
a concealer I just feel like all I want
to do right now is get to 44 inch thin
this out so bad cuz it's so thick and I
feel like even if you just put a little
bit on it would still be so thick though
I mean me I don't know I don't know how
she does it how'd she make it look so
good a few more thoughts on the sponge
though I do feel like the texture of the
sponge is nice it reminds me it feels
exactly like the orange one which I
believe is the miracle complexion sponge
so if you like the texture and you're
worried about texture I feel like this
has that same texture as that sponge
again I just feel like that shape is
just more useful in practical everyday
ways you
something's not broke well I don't know
why we would change it so I feel like
that sponge can do what this munch has
done so far I just feel like this I
don't know i don't really like that it
has this little side I wish it didn't
have like the gap in the middle because
I feel like I get an edge like what kind
of noise even is that uh sorry about
that hopefully that goes why I never
returns so let's do a few thoughts right
now my face looks nice i feel like in
camera from what i can see in monitor
the up close it it's not that looks like
just the worst ever it's so horrible but
it's definitely not the best ever i just
feel like i can see every hair on my
face right now and that's not something
I really enjoy I am quite hairy I have a
lot of peach fuzz and I haven't shaved
it in a while so that could be part of
it but I just feel like the mixture of
everything so like I like the foundation
and I've seen the foundation look great
so I don't feel like that's it i just
think its a mix of like this brush and
then also putting that really heavy
concealer on top of the surface of that
I just feel really textured I feel like
it's really heavy that concealer is just
super heavy coverage wise I can't
complain but I just wish they did the
coverage in a better formula the better
consistency i also just color wise and
not a fan I don't think that this light
color would work for that many people
like this is not light that's pretty
dark to me and very yellow I am gonna
set my face bowl because I get oily and
I always set my face so I'm using two
different powders but they're both
maybelline fit me this is the amount and
poreless translucent I'm gonna put this
underneath my eyes and I'm using this
elf brush that is I think it's a powder
brush but I mind broke so i just use the
top i'm just going to make sure with my
finger that hopefully there's nothing to
Kiki under there i'm hoping that this
color powder will kind of counteract the
yellowness and I feel like not that
brightness of be concealer i'm also
going to put a little in the center of
my face just to kind of help set that in
brighton it and well as hopefully keep
it less oily where the rest
my face i'm using the maybelline fit me
powder in 220 now usually this powder
get to be kind of oily but i found
yesterday it looked really good with the
foundation so I kind of just wanted to
like recreate that look this powder is
more like I feel like a moisturizing
powder if you have dry skin this would
be a good powder for you plus I'm just
trying to use this up for the year so
it's a way to use it but I really liked
the finish even Sam commented on my
makeup yesterday and I don't know that
always feels good I'm gonna go do the
rest of my makeup I'll come back and
show you what it look like afterward and
um well we'll go from there okay guys
i'm back with the rest of my face on
I've done in my eyes I've done my like
bronzer highlighter contour all that
stuff so I will leave everything less it
down below if you guys want to know what
I used I will say I went in to where I
normally get ready and I do feel like my
face looks better without all these like
lights on it i feel like the harshness
of the lights definitely makes me like a
little scared of my face but like in
regular lighting that I normally do my
makeup n I feel like it does look good
but it just looks heavy like it just
looks like a mooring a lot of makeup if
you like that type of like you know you
don't look natural but not necessarily
in a totally bad way it's just you know
like you look made up I do think that
you might like the concealer foundation
again I feel like you can kind of get
the coverage you want with this so I do
like this product definitely the best
I've everything I definitely am going to
be using this and still playing around
with it but I definitely have been
enjoying this and I'm enjoying trying to
find like the best way to make it work
but I do like this I feel like in the
areas where just this is all my face I
think it looks really nice concealer
again it's like how many times he might
say it's just super thick the color is
not my favorite it's really yellow it's
not light enough so I just feel like
that alone right there just doesn't work
for me but I do think for someone who
wants really good coverage this could
work for you if you happen to match the
shade I think that I could definitely
get use out of this but I would thin it
with 244 just to kind of like make it
not so thick a little bit more workable
I just I like a better consistency I
wish that's my biggest gripe but this is
distance II especially when you're
putting it under your eye like it's a
really delicate area if you think like
the cat 1d locket concealers too heavy
definitely not like this that one is a
heavy concealer but I find it just
blends out a little bit better than this
one honestly with that products I think
it would work almost better as like a
concealer for like blemishes or like
pigmentation problems than for like
under I and my last thoughts on the Real
Techniques sponge this is a good sponge
the consistency is nice which i think is
a big thing and it works well when I use
this edge but I just honestly feel like
the original miracle complexion sponge
is better than this I just like the
shape of it better I feel like I can use
it in so many other ways plus it has
this nice edge which makes it different
so I kind of just don't see the purpose
of the sponge and I just don't think
that this does anything that their
original orange sponge can not do wait I
don't think that this sponge does
anything different or better than that
sponge so if you're going to spend the
money I definitely suggest the Real
Techniques sponge is not this one it's
just my experience with it I just you
know the shape was interesting if you
really want to try it I mean it's not a
bad sponge you can definitely get you
said of it but I just feel like for
every day I just like the original
miracle complexion sponge better than
this so that's everything for this I
will update you guys probably just at
the end of the day and let you know if
my thoughts changed at all and maybe
give you uh yeah just my thoughts in
general on how the makeup set and war
throughout the day it is kind of late in
the day like I'm just like hanging out
of my house it's like three clock so I
don't know if I'm gonna have it on for
like a full eight hours we'll see but i
will update you then i'll see you then
it's right now i think almost twelve
o'clock at night so i thought i would
update you my foundations been on tweeze
i'm so sorry my foundations been on
about eight hours almost nine as you can
see it's really greasy in my t-zone area
I haven't touched up at all I tried my
best to not touch my face but I
definitely have some product lifting I
feel like my face looks the worst in the
areas where I put like the concealer you
can see how like creepy it is yeah I
don't mind the oiliness because I could
blot that and then powder you could just
see so much texture it's just
disgusting I feel like my chin is
probably the worst my nose has a lot of
practicing probably cuz me and Sam kiss
so I feel like that's probably why
there's a lot missing from there but
even just like in my cheeks you can just
see all the texture I can see it in the
camera so I know you guys can't do I
will say I felt like the concealer
looked good I was complaining about it a
lot but in person again Sam kind of
complimented me on my makeup so I think
that it looked fine in person especially
I'm from far away and also looked good
on camera when I went back and looked at
the footage it's just heavy and I just I
mean 124 come on I feel like most of my
opinions on the product stand firm still
I do like the foundation I feel like if
I just had the foundation on it wouldn't
look like this so I think that's
everything sorry for the weird update
but that's everything and hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'll see you later
