Lauren this is going to be a first
impression video and it's all on some
pure products well these aren't even in
the screen okay
let me hold them up like way higher I
got these from oculi if you don't know
about obsolete I always have a link down
below if you want to check it out but it
is a site that connects content creators
with brands so that we can try out
products and let you guys know our
honest review let's just get into it I
have four different products to test out
to kind of go together the first thing I
have here are the new foundation the
bear doll foundation from pure and then
I also have the brush that was made to
go with it and then I do have two
skincare items the first one here is the
pure joy stick and this is an exfoliator
cleanser and toner all-in-one and the
last little baby item is the pure
hydrogel lift and this is an eye primer
so I'm really excited for that the only
product I've tried out so far is the
pure joy stick and this again is the
exfoliator I tried this out because I
felt like it'd be weird to do a first
impression like the first time I was
using it since the other products are
more for makeup application but I want
to give you guys my thoughts I've been
using this probably the last two weeks
or so and I really like this this
retails for $26 and it's kind of pricey
for a stick exfoliator but the thing I
love about this is that it's just easy
if you're someone who doesn't want to
spend a lot of time on their skincare
routine I think this would be perfect it
cleanses it exfoliates it tones you can
just move on to your moisturizer right
afterward I personally love it you just
twist up the stick and once my face is
wet I just go in and put this all around
if you can see there are particles
suspended in here that are like
different colors and you think that
that's going to be basically what the
scrub is but those aren't what's really
scrubbing your face I find when I put it
on it's these very micro micro particles
that are scrubbing so if you like a fine
scrub you'd really like this I'm someone
who likes a lot of grit and this
definitely works for me but it's just a
little bit finer than something like my
st. Ives apricot scrub so from what I've
used of this so far I really enjoy it I
think this would be perfect for guys and
just anyone who wants a really simple
skincare routine but effective so this
is a hit for me I think it's really good
I don't think it's something that's just
gimmicky I feel like it actually does
work and have a purpose being in this
like
dick form now let's move on to like
trying some products I'm really excited
I've already exfoliated my face using
that joystick earlier today I also put
moisturizer on and some under eye cream
so just like my normal basic routine
other than that I have nothing on my
face so the first thing I want to go in
with is the pure Hydra lift this has a
little seal on top I'll remove that
throw it on the floor this is supposed
to help cool the eye hydrate the eye and
basically prime it and prep it for
concealer on the website it said you can
also put this on the upper eyelid so I
will be putting it on both today and
trying it out I'm just going straight in
from the tube
it's definitely cooling I'm gonna go in
and just Pat that in with my fingers I
think that these under eye primer type
of things are really awesome I've been
noticing that my eyes have definite fine
lines underneath them and I can do stuff
to kind of like help concealer sit
better and just hydrate that area so it
doesn't look as dry I also like to bake
so this kind of helps counteract the
dryness of the baking I feel like or a
step similar I haven't used this before
but overall it feels nice it's not like
overly sticky or anything it just feels
nice it I don't know I mean not saying
it's not anything special but it does
kind of dry it down so it doesn't have
like too tacky of a finish or anything
alright I don't think it like change the
look of my under-eye or anything not
that it claims to do that but you know
so far I like it I'm excited to put
stuff on top of it and just so you guys
know that retails for $26 on Pure's
website ok let's get into the real thing
we're gonna talk about the foundation
and the brush I'm so excited I've heard
only good things Jacqueline just did a
review on this and she liked it as well
so I am excited to try this out this
retails for $39 so it is kind of steep
there are 10 different shades I have the
shade porcelain that I'm using today
although this is expensive it does come
with 1.5 ounces of product which is more
than normal standard amount of
foundation in a bottle isn't out so it's
one and a half times that I like the
fact that it's in a squeeze tube but I
feel like this squeeze tube is
particularly cheap feeling and I just
feel like for $39 it should be a little
bit more
spensive of a - I feel like my Rimmel
stay matte BB cream isn't better
packaging than this so I just wish it
was in a little bit more Lux of a
squeeze tube because it's $39 and that
is pricey this is supposed to wear for
12 hours on the skin
I don't know how porcelain is gonna do
on my skin because I don't know I'm like
this in-between I'm not like quite the
fairest but I'm not really a light
either so we'll see that's it on my skin
so it's definitely a bit thicker now
like I mentioned I do have the brush and
I'm gonna be using this on my skin today
on one half of my face this is super
soft it feels great but this is a
plastic brush so it doesn't feel as
sturdy as if it was metal I guess is
what I'm trying to say personally I
don't love putting foundation on with a
brush it's not my favorite I really like
sponges for the amount of texture and
hair just things on my face I find that
sponges tend to lay the product on my
face the best but since I have the brush
I'm gonna try it out I'm just gonna dot
this on one side of my face I feel like
this is kind of a lot because it is kind
of thick but I guess we'll see I'm just
gonna go in and just kind of rub this in
I have used a brush like this I may put
this by later I have used a brush like
this before but it was from eBay and it
uh it was a lot smaller so this is
definitely large get a large area of
your face
okay so that's it on one half of my face
I definitely could still see some
imperfections on my face but I feel like
it's a nice coverage it's something I
really like though is that this does
look like skin I can see my skin through
it but it doesn't look like cakey it
just looks really nice I do like the way
it looks I feel like color wise it looks
pretty good too maybe it's a smidge
light
I don't know but with bronzer it'll be
totally fine in person I feel like it
doesn't look though as light as it does
on camera I don't know how I feel about
the brush I mean it's nice that it
covers a wider area than the brush I've
used in the past but these just aren't
my favorite types of brushes to use I
don't know I don't I'm just not into it
I feel like the real test would be using
the official ones the artiste brushes
but this brush retails for $28 so it is
kind of pricey and I just don't like
apply my foundation this way I'd rather
use a regular brush over this and I
prefer a sponge over a brush in general
so anyway I'm going to move on to the
other half of my face using my Beauty
Blender because that's what I like to do
I like the Beauty Blender I'm just going
to dot this on my face again and I'm
just gonna use the rest of the product
that was on my hand this is a pretty
thick foundation though I'm surprised it
blends out as well as it does and as
thin as it does because it's quite thick
so that is the finished product after
blending it out on this half with the
sponge I just realized I didn't even put
a primer on I was so excited to try this
foundation out that I didn't prime my
skin I mean I was gonna use this primer
this is one of my favorites it's from
hard candy the sheer envy one so we're
really gonna be testing this out I do
like to use a primer when I test out
foundations because that's how I
normally wear my foundations
I don't expect a foundation to look
amazing without a primer I feel like
with my skin type and texture that why
wouldn't I give it the best shot it
could you know but keeping that in mind
I feel like this looks extremely good on
my skin and we're really gonna be
testing it out because I am very
and we'll see how this can control the
oil I can't believe I did that
I was like putting this on and I was
like gosh it just feels a little
different than normal when I apply stuff
I don't I couldn't figure out why and
now we know why because there's no
primer I'm gonna go in with the second
layer just to see if it's a little bit
more buildable I just want a little bit
more coverage on my cheeks and in some
areas that I have some redness that's
what I have I don't know if I'm gonna
use all of that but I feel like this
would be a really good foundation too if
you like to apply foundation with your
fingers because of its thicker
consistency I think using the heat from
your hands would really help warm it up
and like have it go on really nicely on
the skin then again these are my
impressions without a primer you
definitely can build this up and get
really good coverage and it still looks
good it's not like overly dewy but it's
not like matte and clinging to anything
gross I would probably wear it for most
days with the coverage built up okay
that is the foundation applied overall
my first impressions are I really do
like it I feel like the color matches
pretty good I'm looking a little pasty
but I prefer looking slightly whiter and
then I can warm up my skin than being
too dark so I mean on camera my skin
looks flawless it looks really good
again for me having no primer on I feel
like it's pretty good although it's
thicker I don't feel like it's really
sticky on the skin which is kind of
surprising because it it kind of felt
sticky using it I don't know if using a
primer would kind of you know cut that
and it would glide a little bit better
but overall I am really liking it I
think it looks really good so I'm gonna
put some concealer on and see how that
goes over it I'm using one of my
favorites this is the Maybelline fit me
and just so you guys know I leave any
thoughts that I have on these products
past my first impressions down below in
the description so if you want to know
what I'm feeling about this product
after wearing it longer and in the time
between filming and posting my video
definitely look down there so that way
you can know if I if I do like it if I
you know changed my mind or whatever
I think first impression videos are
really good and I like knowing what
people think just immediately from
trying something out but I also think
that you can make things work or find a
way to work with a product or what
ever whether it's good or bad as you use
it more so I think that they're just
kind of both helpful so check that out
is ultimately what I'm saying because I
will be trying this with primer which I
you know who knows might make a big
difference I'm gonna set my under eye
using the cap on D translucent setting
powder basically what I've been doing
with this is all set under my eyes I
kind of baked around my face and then as
I sweep off this product I kind of sweep
it into the areas I didn't set with
powder and that don't tend to get very
oily or crease or anything and that's
kind of been my powder routine so oh
yeah baby I just kind of go crazy I am
going to go do the rest of my face and
my eyes and I will come back and let you
know what I think and we'll go from
there
hi guys I am back after doing my full
face and my eyes and everything I will
be having a tutorial on this look coming
up soon so just look for that it's going
to be in conjunction with me duping the
peanut butter and honey palette so
anyway back to the products wanted to
give you some final thoughts before I
you know go about my day and then give
you my recap at the end of the night but
I will say my skin looks really really
good it looks super flawless I think
it's kind of funny because the name is
bare at all but I feel like right now
that I look amazing and flawless I don't
look like I'm baring my actual skin it
is a little cakey or anything so maybe
that's where they're getting it it still
feels like it doesn't feel as heavy as I
feel like the coverage looks that sounds
bad this doesn't feel as heavy as the
coverage would suggest and it still
looks like skin it still looks really
good so I'm really happy I'm excited to
try this with a primer and I'm excited
to see how it'll wear throughout the day
because I feel like it looks really good
I'm really happy with it so far so this
is a win for me so far I will update you
later tonight and also keep you updated
in the description as to how I feel
about this later on but so far I really
do like this I think it's really good it
seems like the hype is real then next is
the brush I'm not really feeling the
I don't think you need the brush I don't
prefer the brush I don't know these
brushes to me just aren't my favorite I
don't know it feels good if you're into
these brushes it's good quality except
for the fact that this is plastic and
bends I don't know not my favorite I
wouldn't buy the brush and they don't
necessarily suggest the brush you guys
know already how I feel about this I
don't really feel like I need to recap
it but this is a go for me too this is
probably my favorite product I've tried
out of all of these because I've been
using it the longest but I think this is
great I'm excited to keep using it and I
could see myself repurchasing this and
the last item here this is the hydrating
under eye primer it's felt really nice
going on the skin I think this is
something I'm gonna have to use a couple
more times to really get an idea if I
like it I don't feel like my eyes look
any more hydrated than normal underneath
them I did use a primer on my upper lids
even though I put this on just because I
have really oily eyelids and I don't
think I don't think anything but a
proper eye primer is really gonna keep
my shadows in place so I will keep you
updated with this this is something in
the description box you're gonna want to
look for it felt nice though I just
don't know if it's worth the price tag
of $26 so we'll see with more testing
and trying different things how I like
this
okay so I will update you guys at the
end of the night when I'm taking my
makeup off and let you know how I feel
like this is looking so far though I
think it looks really good
let me know what you think down below
and I will check in with you later hey
guys I'm here to just do my final
check-in for the day me and Sam went
hiking earlier today so I feel like this
foundation was put to the test and it is
definitely shiny and I have a lot of oil
coming through here I also have some
here but I am oily and with no primer I
feel like this is pretty good sometimes
I can look like this with primer and on
top of that we worked out so I'm really
happy with how the foundation looks it
does look a little bit heavy considering
everything I feel like that's like a big
factor for a lot of that so I'm really
happy I'm excited to try it out more
eyes for the under eye primer I really
didn't notice anything amazing so it
didn't do anything bad do you do
anything good I'm gonna continue to try
that out and see how I like it but it's
just kind of so-so you guys know how I
feel about the brush same thoughts and
then a scrub I still like I mean I
haven't used it twice today or anything
but you
I just wanted to at least give you guys
an idea of what my face is looking like
at the end of the day for the foundation
again check the description if you want
to know any updates between now and when
I post this and other than that that's
everything I hope you guys are having a
great night I'm gonna take my makeup off
and enjoy the night so bye guys I'll see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
