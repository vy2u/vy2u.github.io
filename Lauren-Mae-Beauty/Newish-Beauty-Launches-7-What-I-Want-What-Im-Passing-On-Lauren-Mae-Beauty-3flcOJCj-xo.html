Lauren thanks so much for watching and
it's going to be the seventh video in my
new Beauty launching series where I talk
about new beauty products and whether I
want them whether I don't it's a mixed
into an answer haul and a wish list and
it's just like a fun way to talk about
products and just kind of have a
conversation what we think is going to
be good what we think is going to be bad
well we're interested in what we're not
there are so many makeup products coming
out all the time and they're just suit
different people so let's just get into
it I always talk about ten different
kind of products slash releases so the
first one I wanted to talk about is
something that I've already touched on
before but it is the lorac and the
Pirates of the Caribbean collection I
don't know what video I talked about it
in but my entire Beauty launches
playlist will be linked down below I
talked about it when it wasn't even
shown we didn't know what was going to
be in the palette all we knew was that
Super Bowl Sunday they had let us know
some was going down and I was excited I
love the lorac mega pro formula they're
you know brunch palette not my favorite
so I was really hoping this would redeem
it for me and nothing against this
palette I think it's a pretty palette I
really do I appreciate that it just
wasn't full of a bunch of warm shades
but I just feel like I probably have all
those colors in my collection I don't
have a big enough love for Pirates of
the Caribbean to like need this palette
so for me it's not a must and I'm
probably not going to get it it
definitely looks different though in the
different photos I've seen sometimes
they look really vibrant sometimes they
look really cool toned other times than
like oh maybe it is a little more
interesting than I thought so I
definitely would love to see this in
person and I would swatch it and kind of
go from there but at this point for from
what I've seen I don't need it I don't
think I'm going to get it but it's
really it is pretty I do like it with
that collection though they also came
out with a blush and highlighting
palette has six different shades in it
that retails for $30 and out of the
collection that's probably what I'm
excited about the most I just I don't
know why I'm drawn to blush palette I
just love them
but it looks really beautiful especially
I think for more fair medium skin tones
from what I saw really pretty I don't
own any lorac blushes so it would be a
great way to try some out I felt the
same way about the California Dreaming
palette that was full of blushes so you
know and then last they just came out
with some double ended
as one side to cloth one side to
lipstick they are very pretty shade and
honestly I was a little surprised that
they threw in that blue them allow somes
a little interesting not my cup of tea I
feel like the packaging looks a little
cheap I don't know I'm just not really
feeling them but I've also got a little
product person so you know let us know
if you are down below and why you think
they look so cool but I think it's an
interesting concept something a little
bit different and I love that they went
a little more adventurous with that blue
but you know I won't be getting those
number two let's talk about Becca
cosmetics they are teaming up with
Chrissy Teigen and they are coming out
with a palette it's going to have two
highlighting shades two blushed shades
and everything is new in the palette
except for the rose gold I believe
highlighting shades that is something
that they have in their collection
already but other than that everything
will be new it's going to retail for $46
and honestly I'm not tempted I think the
packaging is beautiful but I've seen
swatches and all the red skin tones and
it's just not a palette for fair skin
which i think is it's not bad I feel
like so much caters to fair skin I don't
think there's anything wrong with
something coming out that caters to
people have more of like a medium or
even darker skin shop I think it's great
I just definitely wouldn't work as a
highlighter on me and I just don't need
an expensive blush palette like that I
don't know why I'm not affected by the
hype of Becca's releases I'm kind of
happy and you know the stage my wallet
but they just don't I don't know they
don't they don't that great to me not in
the main way just like that's cool like
I can see why other people would love
them the packaging is to die for it's
beautiful but it's just it's not
something I'm not excited about so yeah
that's good I feel about that one next
the colored rain color rain is coming
out the new palette now we've already
seen the Queen of Hearts palette so
beautiful I've been recommended it so
many times it cost fifty dollars has 12
shades in it they're all really
beautiful warm tones but they just did a
little something different it's like
it's really hot coral in it there's also
like a really deep like pinky purple
it's so pretty I haven't bought that one
mostly because I just feel like I have
so many similar palettes that I didn't
need another warm tone palette so that's
what's kind of been keeping me away from
it although I've heard it's amazing oh
my gosh I'm not
over why this is so hard for me okay let
me scoot over anyway that's why I'm just
staying away from nap palace but this
new palette I'm so excited for we
haven't seen the inside yet you don't
know when it's going to be coming out we
don't know how much it's going to be but
it is called the cheers to the beauty
palette so I'm excited I'm excited to
see what's in there the packaging looks
really beautiful it's like holographic
and I don't know I'm excited I hope it
will be amazing and then that might be
what gets me to tricolor right number
four is a color cosmetics launch I swear
she's coming up with new stuff all the
time and the collection she's coming out
with is in collaboration with her sister
Kim Kardashian it's a set of four lip
glosses they're all beautiful nudes they
are all very very beautiful when you see
the lined up you're kind of like maybe I
do want them if you're going to wear a
gloss I feel like these are the glasses
that people want so I think it's
beautiful I can totally see what people
are going to buy it hard amis tempted
because they be beautiful in the kids
but I probably won't get them because
they'll probably sell out in four
seconds being launched on 425 I don't
know the price of ends but they're
beautiful the packaging is pretty
everything about them they are really
pretty the next item I want to talk
about this is like the weirdest coolest
thing like I feel like it's so
unnecessary but also so cool this is
from storybook cosmetics and it's called
the red rose brush now it literally
looks like a rose the brush handle is
like the stem of the rose and then the
actual Rose is the brush it's tinted red
like it looks really cool but I'm also
just like how much is that going to be I
don't have a price on it I know what's
coming out I believe in May it's coming
out of May so we'll see you then I don't
know how I feel about this a part of me
likes it and thinks it's really cool
then part of me is like it's just
gimmicky like it's just a brush you know
but then it's really pretty so I don't
know I think this is one for collectors
people who are like obsessed and makeup
have everything and just want everything
then they will love this if you love
beauty and the beach it's very
reminiscent of the like rose in you know
with the pillow falling off I think it's
cool but kind of weird let me know what
you guys think of that down below okay
number six is probably the most
controversial on the list today this is
from Lime Crime and it's the I guess
we're calling it milf right
and me and it doesn't have an i it has a
money sign instead it's four of their
liquid lipstick Velveteen Zin a limited
edition collection so not only is the
name kind of controversial it's also in
a carton of cigarettes packaging which
regardless of what you think I feel like
at this point I feel like it's
intentional like maybe at the beginning
they weren't trying to be as scandalous
as they are now but at this point it's
just their reputation
why not go with it it's just like trying
to put so much in one thing to me like I
don't know how I feel about it I'm not
saying it's bad but I'm not saying I
like it either it's just kind of weird I
feel like they're trying to use that
sensationalism that comes around their
brand because they're outrageous
decisions to their advantage like that's
what I see in this packaging is I'm just
being opportunistic so it doesn't like
quite outraged me because I can see
straight through it almost like I know
what you're doing for you know the
colors look really pretty but I don't
know I'm more bringing this up because
of the way it looks in the packaging and
everything next are some products that
we'll be launching in May for a
cosmetics they have a couple blush
bronzer and highlighter kind of ombre
palettes coming out these retail for $32
which for them I don't think it's too
expensive honestly and they look really
pretty there are three different shades
I think they look nice they kind of
remind me of the Kevin of Kwan ones I
feel like that's kind of the new trends
like these ombre blush bronzer
highlighting type of talents I just feel
like I'm seeing them a lot more recently
and then the other product that they're
coming out with is the heavenly skin
brush now this brush retails for $48 it
looks very interesting it's like a
foundation powder brush
mixed with a duo fiber brush but really
long and stubby
I don't know you'll see pictures I think
the brush itself looks interesting it's
supposed to go with the palettes that
are releasing so you could use it for
bronzing and highlighting and blushing I
don't know if I'd even use it for that
account please it for like foundation
application in my personal like when I
look at it that's what I want to do with
it but the interesting thing about this
brush is that it's supposed to have like
skincare properties built into the brush
so it claims that the property
of silk niacin antioxidants and peptides
are built into the brush to help your
skin I feel like I need training on this
product or something because I don't
understand how that actually would work
and I would love to know how they've
done that supposedly and if I believe it
so it's a cool concept I just I feel
like it's a little gimmicky but if it
actually works that'd be amazing but I
kind of I just my head cannot wrap
around how that's possible I don't know
so that's kind of an interesting thing
number eight is more indie brand melt
cosmetics is coming out with some
highlighters they have three different
shades they kind of showed pictures of
these and released the pictures kind of
slowly like it was one at a time so I
thought first they're only coming out
with one shade then two now it's three
these are releasing in April and they
cost $39 I feel like that is hefty that
is an expensive highlighter $39 I feel
like a $30 highlight is expensive the
lightest shade looks absolutely stunning
though don't get me wrong I think it's a
beautiful highlighter there's a lot of
people who like highlights will like
these I'd love to see some more in-depth
swatches maybe a tutorial of someone
using it but it's really pretty I do
think that it's a nice addition to their
line they mostly are known for their
lipsticks and their eyeshadows so nice
to see something new from them number 9
is milk cosmetics they're coming out
with another one of their holographic
highlighting sticks now it might be only
one that's kind of irritated that they
called it a holographic highlighting
stick one it's not as do a chrome-like
holographic is different than duochrome
right honey it is different I'm pretty
sure that's the cap on D
palette is also labeled like a
holographic palette and it's just like
it's not holographic like holographic is
rainbows duochrome is that it shifts
multiple colors but not all the colors
anyway that's just like something
personal I would love to see an actual
holographic I like make a product that
would be amazing but this is not it
anyway just like a size little tangent
there they're coming out with a new one
though this one's going to be kind of
peachy pink I believe their first one
was more like blue purple tones like
more cool tones it will be on line on
May 2nd and what really put in
perspective the melt highlighters for me
is that this is going to
retail for $28 and I kept him like it's
only only $28 which is still a ton of
money but it was like only $28 because
the other ones 39 so and I think milk is
pretty expensive in their product so I
mean I felt like compared to the Mellow
that's pretty good that's pretty good
and last let's move on let's finish this
up we have the two-faced clover palette
this is a really fun palette for to face
something very different it's going to
retail for $49 and come out in August it
has so many different colors in it
there's like a pink yellow I think I saw
some Purple's there's a green and
supposedly this has 18 brand-new
never-before-seen shades part of the
sales of this product are going to go
help animals in need which i think is
awesome I think the packaging is semi
cute semi not cute at all and just
childish I'm on the fence about it like
it's kind of like kawaii esque but then
I just feel like it looks like a little
kid and not cute so I don't know all the
names are kind of cute though they're
all like dog names there's one like rut
row which is funny and like scooby Doo
but then there's one that's like Daddy's
love me which is kind of awkward I mean
in the context of dogs fine but like you
know kind of a little awkward or shade
anyway I don't really have like too much
beef with that but I just thought it was
interesting if it has good segmentation
I think it's kind of a cool palette and
a fine addition and actually colorful
palette it still has a ton of neutrals
in it I'm not saying it's just like
rainbow but it's definitely the biggest
leap into color I feel like I've seen
from them at least in a while so
definitely let me know what you guys
think about these products down below in
the comments and whether or not you
think they're going to be good or bad or
if you've already bought some of them
and what you think about them thank you
so much for watching guys I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
