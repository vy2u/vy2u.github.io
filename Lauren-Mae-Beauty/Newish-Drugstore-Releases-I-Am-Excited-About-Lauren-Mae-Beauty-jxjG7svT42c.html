Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I'm going to be talking about some
new ish drugstore relationship releases
I keep saying Alicia's help drugstore
releases that are coming out that I'm
actually excited about I think that a
lot of the times in my new Beauty
launches I tend to talk about more
high-end makeup or mid price makeup I
find that those things just excite me
more maybe the price is just so you know
makes it so much more mysterious and
exciting but there are a lot of awesome
things coming out at the drugstore and I
thought I would talk about a few of the
releases that I'm excited about whether
that means I want to purchase them and
and like you know saving up money to buy
them or if that means that I'm not
necessarily gonna buy them but I think
it's a cool direction and it's exciting
in general so yeah let's just get into
it also let me know if you want to see
the opposite of this like things from
the drugstore that I'm like not excited
about I'd love to know I want to start
off with some covergirl stuff first so
I'm sure you guys have seen but cover
girls coming out with a foundation
called the true blend Matt made
foundation and they are releasing 40
shades of it I was lucky enough to
receive it so if you guys want reviews
on it let me know but I think that's a
really awesome thing I'm really happy
about that specifically because they're
a drugstore affordable line forty shades
is a lot of foundations I think it's
really exciting that they are listening
to consumers and wanting to create a
shade range that has enough shades for
hopefully everyone out there whether you
can mix them or not it just has a better
likelihood to match more people I think
it's also specifically exciting because
it is covergirl I think a lot of the
times in their foundations like I'm
thinking the healthy elixir I know Rob
Beauty Christy loves that one and it
just doesn't have enough shades so I'm
really hoping that with this launch I'm
glad they came out with the new
foundation but I'm hoping that some of
their like beloved foundations or at
least a healthy elixir because that is
more geared to dry skin can come out and
have some shade expansions I think that
would be amazing and I just think
overall it's a really positive direction
and I'm happy for that so um yeah that's
the first one I wanted to mention I also
am really happy about it because I did
get the previous covergirl PR box and in
there I just don't feel like the shade
range was very great when it came to the
powders or the concealers so I think
that this is a positive direction and
change that they're going in
and I'm really excited to see what other
complexion products they come out with
continuing on so that is the first one I
wanted to mention another thing from
covergirl though that I am excited about
is they are coming out with a Cho blend
highlighting palette it's going to be in
two different shades and there are three
different colors in each palette
I don't know prices on these yet I was
looking around so if I find prices I
will leave them in the description box
but I'm just happy to see a powder
highlighter from them I wish they would
do singles honestly I would love actual
single highlighters so that way you can
buy the one shade that's really gonna
fit your skin tone that you love but I'm
excited to see what their powder
highlighter formula is gonna be like I'm
excited to see some reviews on it I
don't have that palette at all I just
think that that's exciting so part of
that is also because I got the you know
the cream ones in the pot and they were
not my favorite and I was really wishing
that they came out with powder ones so
I'm excited to see that that is
happening and again to see that formula
moving on there are some new things
coming out from L'Oreal this is like
their paradise enchanted collection I
believe I don't know if this is limited
edition or just like a part of a new
thing they're doing but it's all scented
so first off they have a palette and it
is the color riche Paradise enchanted
palette it's gonna be 1499 which i think
is a really awesome price point that's
one of the things I'm really excited
about because I know their other like
lanoue dalits is that what they are
there's like two different colors of
them those retail for $19.99 so I'm
happy to see the price drop these are
like positioned in a palette differently
they kind of look similar to like the
Stila or the Milani ones they just have
a very similar vibe in the shape and how
the pans are but I think this is an
exciting release in the sense that I
like that it's a different price point I
like that it's something new from them I
know not everyone is going to like love
this palette or this collection because
it is a nude or a neutral palette and it
doesn't have really pops of color it has
those peachy tones and again it's
scented like peach which is totally been
done by Too Faced but I think it's an
exciting thing I'm excited to just see
drugstore brands doing something
different branching out in different
ways so this is something that's
actually exciting to me I think the only
person I've seen really liked feature
this or I don't know I think she might
have it is Nikki Murphy so I'll leave
her channel link down below I don't know
if she has a video or I know
where I saw that if it was on Instagram
or not and then I think I just saw this
morning Jen loves reviews so I'm hoping
one of them will come up with like a
review or something so I can kind of
know a little bit more about it I don't
know why this is like piquing my
interest but it is I'm just excited to
see something new from L'Oreal and I
like the price point of it along with
this line they have some blushes again
they're scented and there are three
different colors they're all neutral
shades like peachy neutrals which that
is my type of blush that I like I really
like peaches on me so this is something
I'm definitely tempted to pick up it's
$12.99 which I feel like is a little
expensive but again you can always find
deals at the drugstore use coupons and
buy one get one freeze and all of that
so that is something that is also kind
of peaking my interest I do like the
packaging too it's like a really soft
pink which has my heart so those are
some things from L'Oreal that I am kind
of excited about and just happy that
they're kind of like going in a new
direction or just like you know bringing
out some new stuff moving on from wet
and wild I know I've talked about this
before but the flights of fancy
collection is something that I was
really pumped for in general I just
really like the idea that wet n wild is
coming out with these kind of box
collections obviously you can buy all
these things individually on the website
and they do go to stores but of course
if you want to for sure get them I feel
like buying from the website is a more
safe option to make sure you get what
you want but I personally like the box
sets I feel like they're affordable for
trying out a lot of different products
from one collection and I know they're
just kind of inspired they always get me
I love affordable makeup so that's
definitely a part of it and then
specifically with the flights of fancy
collection they are taking proceeds if
you buy the box they're putting those
proceeds towards thee I wrote it down so
we can remember the exact title Audubon
Society which it's mission is to protect
birds and their habitats and then the
money is specifically going to the
Allens hummingbird and that's really
cool because you can tell from the
collection it's inspired with the
hummingbird and all of that and I just
think it's a really neat idea that they
are putting money toward a cause that
they're really passionate about
I know colour-pop has done some things
like that as well but I would love to
see more brands to do things like that
and it's so cool to see such an inspired
collection I feel like the makeup on its
own stands for itself but then on top of
that to have this extra
thing going into it is really awesome I
did pick up that collection it released
on May 2nd so I am working on a video on
it so hopefully I can get that up pretty
soon I know my uploads have been a
little sporadic lately I got sick and
then I had like a very random job come
up and I didn't have time to pre film
from being sick so that's part of the
reason trying to get back on track but
just so you guys know I'm probably gonna
be more like every other day until I at
least I don't know get some more videos
because I'm still prepping for Italy as
well so just kind of let you know that
now but anyway I am testing that
collection out currently and hopefully
we'll have a video up on it soon but I
just wanted to mention that because I
think it's a really awesome thing I was
excited for the Gothic graphic
collection I was excited for this
collection as well it's reminding me of
why makeup is fun so yeah I really like
those collections and specifically that
this one is going to help animals
specifically birds and the Allens
hummingbird next on my list is a product
from Revlon and I don't know why this is
has caught my eye but it has and this is
a line in their kiss collection it's the
kiss cushion lip tint it retails for
$9.99 there are 10 different shades and
I think just because I've been very
lucky with the Revlon lip products that
I have tried there's something about
this one that kind of intrigues me I
think that it looks kind of more like a
sheer wearable type of situation but I
haven't seen any reviews on this at
least for the people that I've been
watching in the videos that I've seen so
I maybe should just do like a search and
see what it's about I'm not sure about
the texture on these they remind me kind
of of the next ones that came out in
that I love you so muchi collection I
don't know if it's like a powder to
cream or something like that but overall
they just look interesting to me I kind
of want to try one out in a more neutral
shade to see if I like it and yeah it's
just one that I'm like if I saw that in
store and it was on a good deal I
probably put him a little card all right
next we have some things from Milani
that are really exciting to me I feel
like Milan he's really stepped up their
game they're coming out with some really
cool stuff and first off I wanted to
mention the blush palette these look
really awesome to me I was excited to
see I don't know I think it was on trend
mood I saw them talk about like this
gift set for Mother's Day I went to the
website it was like the one I wanted was
sold out like immediately and now all of
them are but it came with the blush
palette which has
there rose blushes that are really
popular I loved romantic rose I believe
it was but I have since too cluttered it
because I got that like five years ago
and I was like okay it's kind of time to
pass this one on not only is the
packaging on these really really cute
but I know that I like this formula and
I like that you can get like smaller
versions of three different colors and
have some color variation but not have
as big a product as you would if you
bought them individually anyway I think
it's a cool release I'm really excited
about it and I kind of want to pick up
one of them with the bundle though that
is not available anymore so I don't know
really what I'm talking about it but it
came with the oil and you can buy that
separately
but I think that's kind of cool that
they're kind of branching off into
skincare like that another thing for
Milani I'm really excited about are the
hypnotic lights eye Stoppers these are
very similar to like the liquid eye
shadow cream eye shadow thing that's
going around I'm wearing a liquid cream
eyeshadow today from colour-pop I just
think they're really fun ways to add
some spice to your makeup without really
trying like it's so easy just like do
you think they tap it on so yeah I am
excited and really want to try some of
those out but just in general I feel
like Milani has had some really good
releases solid releases things that are
new but still stay true to their brand
and I don't know I've just been excited
about what they're releasing and last
year on a similar note to Milani I feel
like Physicians Formula is really
stepping it up I would love to see them
come out with some more shade options
like that would be the ultimate thing to
really like step up their brand but I
saw Natalie or hashtag fab life
she went to like a party with them and
she showed that they're coming out with
a body butter I'm so excited so I know I
don't love lotions but I am excited to
see if that's kind of a similar
situation to the boom boom cream from
Sol de Janeiro which you guys know I
really really enjoy so yeah I'm really
excited about that I know that they're
coming out with some type of collection
I believe bringing at the bronzer a
blush I think the butter I think maybe a
highlighter and the body butter or maybe
I don't know I've been looking at the
website like kind of saying because I
missed out on the pallid with the butter
bronzer and whatever I went to the
Walmart that is the closest to me they
didn't have it so
and it's not on the website anymore so I
feel like I kind of missed out on that
but I'm hoping it will be a popular
enough release but they'll come out with
a perfume on its own hopefully maybe I
don't know I'm being hopeful and try not
to cry about it okay but anyway I think
it's really cool that they're expanding
their line when you go onto the website
to for physicians formula you can see
there are new releases and I just feel
like in general they're coming out with
some more skin care type of things and I
feel like they're kind of discontinuing
some of their older products and just
kind of have a new revamp to their line
I don't know I just I'm really into it
and so I hope that they'll come out with
a foundation that has more shades I hope
that they'll you know even if they keep
it relatively small and not like 4050
shades or something at least showing the
full spectrum you know what I mean and
having bigger differences so that you
have a bigger spectrum anyway those are
some of the releases that I am excited
about from the drugstore
I love affordable makeup it's just
exciting to me and so I'm I'm happy to
see some more affordable brands come out
with some more inspired things and I'm
just excited to see what else the
drugstore is going to come up with so
let me know some of the things that
you're excited about coming from the
drugstore down below in the comments I'd
love to know and if you have any
recommendations or things you think I'd
really love I would love to know about
them also like I mentioned at the
beginning if you want to see the
opposite of this like things that are
coming out that you know I just I'm not
really into and the reasons why I'd love
to do that as well so just let me know
and I think that's it I know I'm really
casual today if you want to see this I
look I have a tutorial on it I will
leave it linked down below so thank you
guys so so much for watching I hope
you're having an amazing day and I will
see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
