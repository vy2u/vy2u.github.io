Lauren since my finish 5 by November
fifth book challenge is coming to an end
on the fifth of November I thought that
I would jump on the nonfiction November
bandwagon it's like a hashtag I don't
even know I found booktube this year I'm
really engrossed obviously in the beauty
community and so booktube is kind of
this new thing for me and one of my
favorite booktubers i just love her her
name is olive from a book olive I will
leave her link down below she started
this challenge last year with another
woman here on YouTube I'll also have her
channel link down below and I didn't
like join it then I don't even think I
was in to booktube been so I saw her
post about it and I was like I want to
join in on that I want to keep my
reading train going by no means am I
like an avid reader like some of the
other people here on booktube so for
books in one month is kind of a big deal
so overall the challenges just to get
people to read more nonfiction it's kind
of weird for me because I tend to enjoy
nonfiction more than fiction and that's
something that I've noticed watching
other booktubers here that I'm like hi
like everyone's into high fantasy and
sequels and all these things I don't
even know what high fantasy is like I am
I don't really know about those and they
aren't really what interested me I
really enjoy memoirs and documentary
type of books and I that's like what I
enjoy so this challenge is just to get
people to read more of the non-fiction
books and their collection are things
I've been wanting to read that is just
like the overall challenge but then she
does have a more specific challenge
which is to read four books and each
week it's a different theme so I believe
the themes are new let's see if I can do
this I'm just gonna have to look it up
I'm sorry so there are four different
themes for the four weeks the first week
is something new the second week is
something controversial three is it
something important and for is something
fascinating and you can kind of warp
those categories to fit how you want
them to for your books so taking that
into account and also the fact that I
didn't want to buy
new books for this challenge I wanted to
just delve into things I've already
purchased either in my audible library
or in the books that I own I picked out
quite a few different books that I just
want to attempt to read and my goal is
just to finish four of them this month I
think that's a big goal for books in one
month I know again so many booktubers
can like it through twelve books but for
me that's kind of a lot so i hope i can
do that let's just get started in the
books that i want to potentially read
these I believe are all non fiction my
goodness if I have a book that's like
not nonfiction in here like just forgive
me and pardon me anyway one of the first
books that I'm really interested in
reading this is Anna diverse Smith let's
hope I said that right this is Twilight
Los Angeles 1992 this is actually I
believe a play but it's like a
documentary play so it takes words that
are verbatim from people i believe the
conflicts that happened in 1992 this is
her documentary theater which uses the
verbatim words of people who experience
the los angeles riots to expose and
explore the devastating human impact of
that event I just think that sounds so
interesting I was actually born in 1992
so this isn't something that I
experienced myself but living in Los
Angeles it's a big part of our history
and I do want to just read more about it
I think it's just a really interesting
way to first of all like make a play and
then to use people's actual words and to
explore that I think this will be really
interesting something to I feel like why
I'm so drawn to nonfiction work is
because I like even with what I studied
I studied religion and applied ethics
and history those are my two degrees and
I really enjoy finding out what people
think people's experiences how this
experience have shaped their lives and
turn them into who they are and that
type of like anthropology behind those
behind people I just enjoyed people so I
think that's a reason i connect so much
with non fiction as opposed to fiction
although I like being swept away into a
really fun story I feel like it just
helps you connect with people and to
have sympathy and empathy for other
people just like you know we're all
human I don't know anyway
thanks bug let's talk about another book
this is a book by david sedaris this is
called when you are engulfed in flames
by no means is this a new book but i
believe almost all of his stories if not
all of them are like about him kind of
like memoirs experiences in his life and
his kind of take on life itself so i
have read diabetes with owls or
something like that me and Sam listen to
that in an audiobook and that was really
funny I've also read part of his like
Christmas one where he was like a
Christmas elf and he's just hilarious
he's so funny so I'm excited to read
this i have another book by him to that
i want to get to so i want to put this
into the potential to read and again you
know I kept those words in mind like
interesting controversial those types of
things when I was trying to pick these
books out of my collection I don't know
you decide what category they're in next
I have a book called the Liege letters
and these are letters between william s
burroughs and allen ginsberg i believe
yes so um right now we're listening to
hunter s thompson sphere and loathing in
las vegas and i don't know why but I
feel like william s burroughs and hunter
s thompson to me just like on a similar
plane I don't even know if that's true
or not I think just the drug use
probably I remember getting the story
kentucky kentucky speed i think is a
book by him and it was also i think
attached with junkie or was attached
with naked lunch um and I got that when
I was so young I remember being in
borders which I think borders is gone
now how sad I remember being in borders
and picking that book out and I was too
young to read that so I don't feel like
I really absorbed anything about it and
I just remember it I think the reason i
connect them is because i remember
having the same feeling reading that
book as I kind of do now reading hunter
s thompson it's just kind of like a lot
going on it's a lot to take in i feel
like you could almost read those books
multiple times and catch things like
different every time you read it but
anyway these are letters back and forth
between the two of them and i just think
that would be really interesting to read
i picked us up at a thrift store a while
ago it's short which is a draw to it but
I've had this for a while and I feel
like I should just read it it would take
no time at all and I would just really
like to add this and
to a book I've read two more like paper
books if you guys watch my finished by
by November you guys have seen this this
is the book snoop and this is a book
that talks about what your stuff says
about you and how you can kind of
decipher people's personalities and just
what they like what they don't like all
these things and get clues about them as
a person by the things that they have
where they put the things that they have
it's a really interesting book I am
already like 80 pages into it so I just
kind of want to like push myself and
finish this book I do really like it
yeah I just want to finish it okay last
paper book this is in cold blood by
truman capote i kind of thought of this
as like the controversial one it's also
super interesting I've watched the movie
so I that's really all I know about the
book itself so it's not much but I
believe if I going off the movie Truman
Capote like interviewed the guy who i
believe he like murdered his family or
whatever and he had interviews with him
in prison and really like got to know
him and then that's what this book is
about is that guy I'm interested to see
how this compares to the movie philip
seymour hoffman is really amazing in
that movie so um I just thought I've had
this book again for a while as well and
I think it would be a good read it's
interesting and I just kind of want to
see how this book translates from the
film I want to see how this book
translated into a film I guess because I
just finished the girl on the train
y'all know and it was nothing compared
to that like the movie was so bad so um
if you've read the book I don't know
what it's like if you haven't read the
book and you just go into the movie it
might be great but if you've read the
book it's just like d'afrique is
happening oh I finally feel people who
are just like the books so much better
that's like me with that maybe I was so
disappointed anyway I hope I'm not to
blow now I probably am but I'd rather it
be like so okay the last book that I
want to potentially read or maybe two
more there on my audible I'm trying to
pick stuff on my audible because I know
I actually read there's a better chance
of me reading it on my audible than in
real life because if I'm like up late
and can't sleep I'm not going to turn
the light on and like Sam up or whatever
so I can listen to
audio book so the book that I want to
read is called rabid this book I
actually already started with Sam when
we were road tripping a couple like
probably a year or so ago maybe two
years at this point but we never
finished it so it's about rabbit is I'll
read the synopsis it says the most fatal
virus known to science rabies kills
nearly a hundred percent of its victims
once the infection takes root in the
brain from Greek myths to zombie flicks
from the laboratory heroics of Lewis
pasture to the contemporary search for a
life-saving treatment rabbit is a fresh
fascinating and often wildly
entertaining look at one of mankind's
oldest and most fearsome foes that's
something that I don't know totally
interests me I remember when we were
reading this something that they were
talking about it I never knew that one
of these symptoms of rabies is like you
have a fear of water like a phobia of
water and I thought that was really
interesting so I think it's just fun to
read little things about that I like
knowing just like weird little facts and
I just want to finish that book in my
library and I already have it so it's
not like a book I need to purchase and
then the other book that I might reread
I've actually already read it it's
called in sheep's clothing me and Sam
actually already listened to this book
as well but it's really sure it's only
four hours and I feel like I think about
it kind of a lot but I don't remember
everything I feel like sometimes books
get stuck in your brain but I'd really
like to know more of the details again
back on this book so this summary on
this one is dr. George k Simon knows how
people push your buttons your children
especially teens are experts at it as is
your main a co-worker make quietly
undermine your efforts while professing
to be helpful or your boss may pray on
your weaknesses manipulative people have
two goals to win and to look good doing
it I just think it's interesting to you
know look at people's behaviors what
they're doing I feel like you come in
contact with a lot of different people
obviously in life and it's always great
to have the skills to maybe spot people
who are bad influences or who are not
good people this book kinda is trying to
like help you do that and I feel like it
um just can't protect yourself I don't
know I sounds good as I go but I've done
I'll have people in my life and I think
there's a big stigma on like you know
cutting people out or you know you want
to give people the benefit of the doubt
like oh it's because they're past it's
because of this and you know sometimes
it's not sometimes people just aren't
good people and it's okay to just cut
them out of your life and that's like
it's okay UFO in like your health your
family your mental health all that is
more important than people who just they
actually just do have bad tendencies and
obviously that's not everyone but I feel
like normal humans are our nature is to
give people second chances and to give
people the benefit of the doubt and I
don't know sometimes it's nice and
reassuring to read something that's like
no sometimes people are just crappy or
they don't connect on those same levels
and to protect yourself against them
that's okay it's not like rude so um
okay those are my books hopefully I can
get four of those done during the month
of November I'm really excited for this
I think it'll be really fun it's my
first like booktube challenge that I've
just like jumped in on I'm so excited
