is going to be a nonfiction November
update the reason it isn't updates
because I'm not ending nonfiction
November one I love nonfiction but to um
yeah it wasn't successful so I'm giving
myself another month to be successful I
was kind of busy in November but mostly
we left also at the end for family and
we just we I'm including my husband
because a lot of these audio books i
read partially with him but I just
wasn't as successful as I wanted to be
or at all so I'm really hoping that
maybe december can be my Redemption
month we'll see let's start off with
some books that I started and not least
have progress on so in cold blood by
truman capote was one of the books they
wanted to read so many of you guys in
the comments mentioned this was a book
you had been given or that you were also
reading or that you enjoyed so this is
the one I decided to pick up first and I
am on page 30 if you can call that
progress I definitely want to finish
this book but it is kind of a dense read
I mean it makes sense it is nonfiction
so it's not going to be like butterflies
and rainbows and poppy flowers I should
have known that going in but it
definitely just takes me sometime if I
read it that night I kind of fall asleep
immediately so I do want to finish this
out of the other books that i showed you
actually in like paper form which i'll
leave a link down to that video if you
want to see him cuz i'm not going to
show him here i haven't started any of
them were read any further in them if i
had started them so i'm hoping to read
the age letters i was so tempted to just
like sit down for like an hour and a
half and read the age letters and just
like finish it so that i had some
progress to show you guys but I didn't
even do that like I could you do that
guys lord help me and then the other two
books that were potential reads for
nonfiction november were on my audible
so the first one here is the book rabid
and this is a book all about rabies and
me and my husband were listening to this
in the car ride on the way to Arizona
and all the way back but we had to take
breaks from this because me and we would
just so we would have been crushed dead
in the desert for sure because we would
have fallen asleep I enjoyed this book
and I think it's good and I can
definitely see people enjoying it but
its kind
dry especially when it's being read to
you um yeah it's very gruesome so if you
are not into that like I don't know if
you would enjoy this book we're sitting
in the car and some of the things being
said by the narrator are just so just
kind of gruesome talking about like dogs
eating bodies and the bubonic plague and
death and vampires and I don't know it's
just it's all backed up by different
researchers into like where these myths
came from just different things about
rabies oh yeah if that sounds
interesting to you anything I just said
or you know anything you thought by me
saying these things maybe you would
enjoy this book it's just kind of a lot
so I'm hoping by the time we go back to
Arizona um at the end of December we can
like get through it a little bit more
but it's also something that's tied up
with both of us so I can't just listen
to it when I'm at home alone I need him
here because he'd be so difficult the
rabies book without him no he probably
wouldn't be but you know it's kind of
like we embarked on this together so
we're at the end of chapter five and
there are 10 chapters so we're about
halfway done with the book I really want
to finish those these are some dense
chapters to there like an hour long and
we're listening to 11 and a half speed
and it just takes a lot of time to get
through that much like history and
research and that's something that's
really interesting about it but it also
makes it like a lullaby no you know what
I'm saying and the other book that we
were reading was the sheep in wolf's
clothing oh no it's just called in
sheep's clothing i don't know why i
always say wrong but in sheep's clothing
and this is something that we were
listening to on the way to Las Vegas and
again it just was a little too much to
read while driving we needed something
that's a little more stimulating while
you're doing something so monotonous I
think you listening to something that
can be considered monotonous it's not
like super exciting in the sense of like
action-packed or something can
definitely just make you go to sleep and
we we didn't want to die in the desert
again so this has 14 chapters these are
smaller chapters but we're only on
chapter 4 so we're gonna work
through that one again to this one's a
pretty sure read it's only three hours
long as like a book but we just didn't
kind of get back into it and said we
started rabid hoping that we wouldn't
fall asleep during that one but you know
so anyway this is just like an update I
hope you guys don't mind I was thinking
like why do i do book videos don't want
to read but i do want to read that's a
thing it's just definitely harder for me
I've mentioned this before but my
personal favorite type of like media to
consume or like stories are like TV
shows and movies I'd love it so me and
Sam are actually starting a second
channel like together it's gonna be
called salmon because our named Samm and
Lauren and we're doing like movie
reviews and just different things like
what we watched in the month of whatever
on netflix or just different things i
thought that would be fun and away from
me to share that portion of my life
because that is way bigger like I just
enjoy sitting down and watching like the
neon demon / reading for two hours so
anyway I want to still try to get
through some of these books but I
thought it would just update you guys
and not let this just fall off the face
of the earth and I will hopefully update
you by the end of the year the beginning
of the year on where I'm at and then I
kind of want to do something for the
year I don't know what that's going to
be but um I'll start thinking about I'll
start thinking about how unsuccessful I
can be reading other bugs that's
everything for this video I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day and I
will see you in my next one guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
