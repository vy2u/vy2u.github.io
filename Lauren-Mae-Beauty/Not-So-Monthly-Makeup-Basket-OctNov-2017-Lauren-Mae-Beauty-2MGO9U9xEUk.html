Lauren we are in a different position I
have a towel down everything's different
I wanted to film a couple videos tonight
and I didn't really want to get on
camera with my face so I thought it'd be
a great time to I don't know finally
update you guys on my make a basket
these are the items I was using
basically all through October and into
November I was trying to do these
monthly and I wasn't doing a very good
job so I'm gonna still continue to do
these I really do like showing you guys
what I'm mostly using for a month or so
giving you many reviews and just kind of
like showing you the items I am learning
to love in my collection I just don't
know if they're gonna be monthly I'm
gonna try still but it's hard guys it's
super hard anyway you know ignore all
the mess in the background this is just
the setup I wanted tonight so we're
gonna start with the items on top these
are all things that don't fit into the
drawers that's why they're up here so
for bronzers I have two this is the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer you
guys know I love that so that is
something I've definitely been reaching
for
especially since I'm losing my tan and
then the other bronzer that I've been
using is the bronze goddess bronzer from
Estee Lauder and I love this I was not
expecting to love this as much as I do
but it is amazing so far it's so great
so I'm so incredibly happy with that
product I have the kiss Pro touch
setting powder which is just a
translucent setting powder you guys know
I love that for foundations I do have
the Sephora airbrush and that's in here
because it's in my 12 pans of Christmas
if you don't know what the twelve pans
of Christmas is definitely go check it
out I'm gonna leave the video link down
below and last on here this is the
Saturday skin daily do mist I've been
using that to set my makeup and kind of
just seeing how that works so that's why
that's in here I've been using it to
foil too it's just my newest mist or
spray so I've been testing it out let's
get into drawers and I'm gonna probably
zoom us in a little bit more for the
stuff in the drawers so this is like my
foundations and face stuff I have a kind
of propped up so hopefully this works
this is my clearance powder that I've
been testing out from octa Lee really
been liking it it's been really nice I
have my Revlon nearly naked powder
because that is what I've been using for
my told pans of Christmas something kind
of new this is a laura geller foundation
it's in porcelain and it's pretty light
for me but I've been liking to use it
actually underneath my eyes just like
not quite like underneath like where
it's the most delicate skin but kind of
just in that highlighted area and that's
been kind of nice for a more glam look
when it comes to like foundation
foundations I have the NARS one here
this is only 12 pans of Christmas check
that video out and then I have my two
sticks this is the Lancome taunt
Edel foundation stick I have the
hourglass Foundation stick two of my
favorites and then I have three
different primers here this is the YSL
blurring primer love that this is the
cover FX blurring primer and that one's
okay and then the koke smooth glow I've
actually been enjoying this it doesn't
have a bunch of silicones in it which is
something I'm actually enjoying lately I
like a silicon primer but sometimes it's
nice just have something moisturizing so
those are what I've been using on my
face in the next drawer I have like
blushes bronzers and highlighters but
none of my bronzers fit in here that's
why there's none in here you saw them
already
so for highlighters I have my pure
essence a nude highlighter I love this
so much it's so stunning it's beautiful
love it for a natural - a little bit
more highlighter I definitely suggest it
and then I have my urban decay illusion
I shadow in here - which I use as a
highlighter again in my 12 pounds of
Christmas when it comes to blushes I
only have two in here I have been using
my benefit 1/2 but it's like I just show
you guys the same stuff this is the
Milan blush from girl lactic I really do
like this I've been testing it out for
the 12 days of Christmas I'm trying to
potentially hit pan or just use it as
much as possible and so yeah it's been
going well it's just mad and this is the
Tarte blush and party I really like this
one as well this is something I reach
for quite often and then I do have a
bronzer in here I guess I didn't realize
this is my NARS palette this is from a
couple Christmases ago this is the
virtual domination palette I am focusing
on hitting pan and this bronzer so that
is what I'm working on
and yeah so those are my face products
when it comes to like color cosmetics
next we have a lot of different things
this is like eyebrow pencils eye liners
lashes and primers so I have my two brow
pencils this one is from colour-pop and
then this one is from ELF you guys hear
me talk about those all the time I've
been using my Lancome brow stylist brow
gel that's really nice as well really
like that product I have two different
primers in here this is the Maybelline
one you guys know I use this all the
time I'm just using it up it's nice it's
not bad and then I did get the Laura
Mercier one in a like point perk I
actually don't know how I feel about
this I've been using it right now and
then but so far it's definitely not my
favorite I would not purchase it at the
moment
moving on to eyeliners I have three
different ones this is the color pop
white liner and exit I have a green
urban decay liner in stash and then this
one is a felt tip from ciate I've
actually been doing a bit more like
winged liner I've been just trying like
mix up my makeup looks not only for
camera but then Halloween I did some
stuff with like a winged liner as well
so I definitely have been getting some
use out of that lately
I do have another liner this is the
glitter liner from Urban Decay cosmetics
in the color pyro it's part of the new
liners that they came out with loved it
so much highly recommend these eyeliners
the perfect way to wear glitter without
it being messy you guys already know I
love that and then for mascara I do have
three different ones this is the Tarte
lights camera lashes it's just a mini
that I got in a mascara mini set from
Sephora of course Urban Decay perversion
I love it and then this is the newest
one for me to test out this is number
seven lash impact ultra mascara I have
been enjoying this mascara too I have
pretty decent lashes so it kind of takes
a mascara to be like absolutely crap for
me not to like it so so far I've been
liking everything though those those
work out for me pretty and nicely when
it comes to eyeshadow I've actually not
been doing that much when it comes to
like real life I've been putting a lot
of like this in my crease and going
so yeah like bronzers and easy stuff I
have been using the Physicians Formula
quad in classic nudes quite a bit I
obviously have a ton of panel in the
shadow but the other matte shades in
here have been getting a lot of use out
of me they just come in handy I love
that it's in a compact little form I
also have been using the My Little Pony
palette from colour-pop I did a look
with this using like some of these more
icy blue colors and that was really fun
I've also been enjoying these like
orange shades and I've done a look with
like monochromatic orange which I will
probably be doing a get ready with me or
tutorial on soon so that is something
I've been using a lot lately and then
this is my lorac mega Pro please ignore
the fact that it is absolutely
disgusting this packaging just it
doesn't forgive inside is no better when
it comes to messiness but I have been
using this a lot because it's in my 12
pants at Christmas and I'm trying to hit
pan on at least two shades in here
before the end of the year
espresso already had pan so that doesn't
count but I have definitely been trying
to utilize this palette as much as
possible wow we really just flew through
these drawers I'm so happy this is my
lip drawer not too much in here but just
enough so this is the My Little Pony and
color pop color it's just a lip gloss in
flutterby
love it I've also been using the nude
Stix artist set these are the two colors
I've been using the most this is the
color choice which is like a really dark
lip if you've seen me in a dark lip it's
been this and then this is the color
Sonoran which I wore in a video that I
filmed like three or four videos that
day and so yeah you guys all took a poll
on if you liked it but that has been
something I've been you know testing out
and trying out for lip liners I've
really been enjoying this bite Beauty
lip liner I don't talk about it too much
but this is in the color 20 it's just a
nice kind of warm nude which isn't my
normal thing I don't like to warm up
nudes on me but that one's nice I've
also been using the by Terry one I'm
sorry I haven't been swatching
everything I just feel like it gets so
repetitive sometimes this is in the
color rose contour I believe from by
Terry this is also my twelve Panza
Christmas so you know I have two of the
buxom full-on lipsticks this is the
color Sydney which is a like
and then of course my favorite dolly the
next item here is from Clarins and it's
actually a lip oil in a mint flavor I've
just been trying to get better about
putting on lip products when it comes to
doing my makeup like beforehand to
moisturize my lips so they're in the
best condition possible before I put lip
products on so this has been helping me
do that I really do like it
I just put the tiniest amount of this on
though if I put too much I feel like
it's you know kind of oily but this
doesn't feel like an oil at the same
time anyway I've just been trying to use
and then this is my sugar rosy lip
treatment from fresh this is also my
child pants at Christmas so yeah that's
everything guys that I've been using I
mean obviously now and then or if I'm
reaching for something very specific
I'll reach for other things but that is
the majority of what I've been using and
loving and exploring in my makeup
collection the last month and a half two
months so I hope you guys enjoyed the
video thank you so much for watching and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
