Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to share with you some
beauty products that I thought were a
little strange maybe a little weird
definitely something different or off
the beaten path that doesn't mean that
these are bad products or that they
wouldn't be useful I just thought that
these were things that you don't see all
the time and they were interesting so I
hope you guys enjoy I don't know what
I'm gonna title this yet so we'll see
because I feel like strange makes it
seem like it's gonna be like crazy and I
don't think that all of these are crazy
I just when I look at them they pique my
interest because they're just different
than what you would normally see in the
beauty realm so let us know if you've
tried any of these more strange Beauty
items and other than that let's just get
into the items I thought were a little
weird a little different a little
innovative alright the first product I
want to talk about is called bust dust
this retails for $16 you can get it
online at Ulta and this is a powder that
you spray onto your boobs so that you
don't get boobs what I thought this was
a very interesting and innovative
product I mean obviously baby powder and
things like that have been like used for
long periods of time to kind of like
stop sweat and things like that but just
a powder specifically made for boobs
what I thought was funny and potentially
useful like I'm a girl that has some big
ol boobs and so yeah I think that sounds
like nice if you're a female you know
about the woes of boobs what so I
thought this one was just kind of
interesting and innovative and kind of
weird if you've tried this let us know
if it works and if you think that it's
something that's a must-have
or if you can get the same effect with
like other powders next is a product
from sol de janeiro you guys know that I
love that brand but this is the golden
body veil it retails for $32 and
essentially what it is is it's a hair
bleaching kit and I know that bleaching
hair on the body is not like a new thing
it's not crazy but I just feel like from
mainstream brands who have other more
popular products in their line they
don't have a bleach kit for your body
hair they also tie this into their brand
because they talked about how in Brazil
people love to have like golden hairs on
the body and like have that peach fuzz
that's like golden in the Sun so it kind
of like goes with their brand and theme
on that but I just thought this is like
such a different product for a brand to
like have in a way
other brands that have the same product
aren't doing like I feel like if you're
buying a hair bleach kit you're buying
it from a brand that basically only does
that and that's why I thought this one
was like a little bit different or
interesting for a brand to like do I
honestly don't have to worry about that
because I have golden hairs which maybe
is great for the rest of my body but for
my eyebrows I have to fill them in
everyday cuz they're golden alright next
let's talk about the kind of trend in
these blemish spot treatment little
circles so I've seen two different
brands but I think that there are more
out there there's one from Sephora
called peace out and they are like
little dots that you put on your acne
like when you go to bed I've heard
really good things about these but it's
a little bit different than just like a
spa treatment it kind of feels like it's
going to like really lock that in
instead of it being exposed to air you
know like that outer film is really
keeping the product on the acne spot and
really not letting it like breathe other
stuff or like air out the one's from
peace out you get twenty dots for $19 so
it's kind of expensive and then there is
one from Karuna as well on Sephora it
retails for $18 and you get 24 different
circle patches so these are something
that I'm actually interested in trying
because I have heard a couple good
reviews and it just seems so handy where
is the Mario Badescu one you can't like
bring that around because you can't like
shake it up so if you were traveling
these just seemed super handy tab and in
like a very compact format next is
something that I don't really hear many
people talking about on YouTube but I
know when I worked at the beauty store
work dot like everyone bought this all
the time this is a product called the
cool fix it's a blue gel that you use
after you shave or after you wax to help
like soothe the skin to the pores and
also get rid of any ingrown hairs or
anything like that
I feel like there aren't a ton of
products on the market geared
specifically to target this issue so I
thought I would just let you guys know
about this one cuz it is a bit different
and this is something that I've heard
just amazing rave reviews about so if
you were struggling with waxing and
shaving and ingrown hairs or just really
irritated skin after you do those
activities I would highly suggest
checking this out I know a ton of people
really really enjoy it alright next on
the list is a product that is a
pillowcase and this is a copper and whew
pillow case from iluminage I think is
how you would say the brand this retails
on Sephora for $60 they call this a skin
rejuvenating pillow case that minimizes
visible signs of aging as you sleep
because of the copper ions and how they
interact with your skin's like layer or
like upper layer of skin honestly I'm
not really sure how I feel about this I
don't know enough about like the science
behind it but yeah I just don't know if
a pillowcase can really just rejuvenate
your skin because you're sleeping on it
let us know if you've tried that if you
think it works amazing I would love to
know again if you've tried any of these
things let us know are they worth it are
they not some of these are gimmicky and
some of them are just weird so yeah
that's a pretty expensive pillowcase
next on my list is from cap re and they
do a bunch of like coconut oil products
and I've heard good things about their
products although it's just kind of
coconut oil so it seems kind of
expensive for what it is and this
products no different these are coconut
oil pullers they retail for $28 you get
14 little packets and just to be a
friend I don't think that oil pulling is
weird my mom did all pulling for a long
time and if you don't know what oil
pulling is it's where you put some
coconut oil in your mouth you swish it
around for like 20 plus minutes right
when you wake up to like kind of
detoxify your mouth and get all of these
like yeah toxins out of your body
because they collect there overnight I
don't know that's kind of my idea or
what I've heard and then you spit it out
and your breath is cleaner it's like
really good for oral hygiene and just
good overall for your body that's what
everyone says so anyway I don't think
that that's weird I just think that this
is so expensive this product makes sense
for their brand because it is a coconut
oil product but it's not really like
quite Beauty like like the other
products in their line so I think this
one is just like so expensive I will say
though they are flavored like pina
colada mint and vanilla so if you wanted
a flavored one I guess maybe this could
be kind of worth it but oh my gosh $28
for only half a month of oil pulling I
don't know I think you're supposed to
oil pull every single day oh my gosh
that's expensive habit moving on let's
move on the next items on my list are
from the brand bad baby and these are
kind of like travel sized products so
one
is the flexi-firm hairspray pen this
retails for three dollars and 47 cents
is TSA approved it has 200 sprays in it
and it's basically just like a little
pocket hairspray but in pen form I just
thought the formatting of these products
is really interesting also these aren't
aerosol so you know if that's something
you don't like or do like there's that
to consider but then they also have a
dry shampoo pen which is the same price
three dollars and 47 cents again it has
over 200 sprays and this just seems
really interesting to me like how does
that work also just because it has 200
sprays how long does this actually last
like how many sprays you need to get
like an actual application I think the
idea of these being really small and
compact and travel friendly is kind of
cool and it's like an interesting thing
but I just wanted to mention these
because I thought they were different I
haven't really seen anything quite like
this or have the same idea and the last
item on my list is the completely bare
pitstop hair inhibiting deodorant you
can also find this item at Ulta com so
this is supposed to soften the skin and
kind of soothe the skin but there is an
extract in here that is supposed to
inhibit the hair from growing as fast
and just overall slow the hair growth of
your underarms and I think this sounds
like this like miracle product I'm not
sure obviously if it works or how
effective that extract is its allure
area Diva ricotta I'm gonna leave it up
here cuz you all know I can't see
anything that's supposedly the extract
that's doing that so it seems
interesting I feel like it's almost kind
of gimmicky because I just don't know if
it actually work and I mean I think
since it's more natural hopefully it's
at least safe for you but your retails
for $10.99 again let us know have you
tried any of these products alright guys
so those are some of the more
interesting or different products that
I've seen just online as I've been
browsing websites mostly Alton's for
because you know I'm always browsing
their website so let us know if you've
tried any of these things in the
comments do they work do they not should
we try them should we not and stay far
far away
I don't know how different these were to
you but definitely they were something
that caught my eye as I was browsing so
thank you guys so so much for watching I
really hope you enjoyed the video and I
will see you in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
