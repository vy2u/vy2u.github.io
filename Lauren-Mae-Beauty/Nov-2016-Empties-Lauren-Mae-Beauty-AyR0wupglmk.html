Lauren this is going to be my November
empties video no october november yeah
November's gone holy crap that was
really weird I really had a nice so
let's get into my mp4 November the end
of the year comes so fast it's my
favorite time but it comes like that
love will start with makeup of these
first let's just get into it this is my
BB cream from purely this is a sample it
was in the color medium so I had to mix
it I really enjoyed this beauty cream I
would definitely look into trying out
the lighter shades for my actual skin
talent but I felt like it had a lot of
coverage and I enjoyed it so I
definitely would love to try maybe a
sample of that or i don't know i don't
know how expensive it is but i enjoyed
it ultimately i enjoyed it this is
something that is from my kids this is
the enabling great lash and it's just
the black mascara the classic one for
maybelline this is what i use in my kit
because i've used disposable ones
obviously too safe sanitary so it
doesn't matter what the one looks like
it doesn't matter to tie and i just need
something to put on people's lashes so
that they have nice lashes plus most of
the time i am using false lashes so this
almost doesn't even matter so I just
repurchased this and put it in my kid
again and yeah I enjoy it and I highly
suggest this for anyone in their kit
unless you have someone with specific
knees or someone they're working on
Austin this works great and I last kind
of make up empty this is from sent bird
and this is the melon and guest moroccan
fixin i was sent this from sense bird
and i really enjoyed this scent i do
miss it kind of i did like it a lot it
smells really clean and kind of people
said lawn clippings or grass kind of
like a woodsy grassy smell at first and
it kind of turns into a sweeter fig
sense but it's not very sweet at all it
is a unisex perfume so you know men and
women can wear it if i can do a better
idea i enjoyed this though and i do
suggest sent bird in general as a way to
try out different perfumes they
contacted me to send me more stuff all
ready to do like a gift video and I just
didn't I didn't want to make a gift
videos just to include sent bird so I
declined but
I do highly suggest Sanford and think
they're a good company and I did really
like this sense I got to try from them
and the last like makeup thing this is
our own NC but it's something I'm
declutter and this is the lalak from
l'oreal and it's in the shade choco lack
chocolate this is disgusting name anyway
I don't like this because the packaging
looks like it'd be such a pretty color
but the color inside I just wore this
yesterday and was like never wearing
that again the colored side is way more
pink I don't know if it's going to show
up on camera let's see but do you see
that like you're not getting the actual
shade you think you are it just made me
look look bright pink I didn't like it I
don't suggest it and I'm going to pass
it on it's gone baby now a few other
things i have some skin care but i also
have a lot of random stuff i'll keep
that at the end zone in case you don't
want to see it but i just have to like
favorite food i didn't said i wanted to
show you guys since I finished them up
this is the st. Ives green tea scrub and
this is ok but I do prefer the other one
over this the apricot scrub this one is
just too fine for me I just enjoy
something a little bit grittier at
little marker it's a little more action
happening on myspace so i won't
repurchase this but it was good i
finished up a facial spray this is the
Ellimist soothing apricot toner I have
been working on this and other projects
and stuff and I finally finished it up I
enjoyed this but I would never pay the
money for this it's nice and it kind of
got me back into using spray toners so I
did enjoy it but I wouldn't I wouldn't
purchase it the one that I actually want
to spend my money on next would be the
Mario Badescu one just because it's kind
of an expensive and I want to try a rose
won again so tough that that's bad I saw
didn't mean sometimes it's so hard to
like how do you wrap this project up and
be benefit and so then I understand the
same crap at every end and so you're
dating when I edit it I hate it next
empty is the tees do you guys know I
love this it's so good get it at
marshalls 449 while of law y'all know
the drill I have a simple micellar water
in here this was in my pit so it took a
while he's up I do really enjoy this but
I enjoyed the Garnier a little bit
better because of the price so between
the two
one's more readily available to that one
but they both are really good and they
both work really well to get off makeup
I have some of my favorite white these
are in all man sees as well you get a
mess big lots they are so good I don't
enjoy the gray team my favorite is the
aloe but i'm still working through a
couple of tax i bought before so once i
finish those i will go back to the
allen's they're just my favorite sense
the cucumber ones are the worse though
these are green tea the cucumber one
smells so sweet i don't really like
those anyway i do enjoy these whites in
general though a two-faced we always go
through a toothpaste I feel like this is
the Colgate optic white and i got these
tacos I rather micellar water this is
from noobs and this is d-rose micellar
cleansing water I really enjoyed this I
was kind of weirded out at first cuz i
had a roast sense but it didn't burn my
eyes at all I kind of missed this a
little bit because i'm just using a
normal gardening one and there's
something about the smell of this when i
was doing it I just I don't know I just
started getting into the habit of having
that smell at nighttime and all that so
changing back the first couple times is
kind of weird but I did enjoy this I
don't know if I'd percocet for its full
price and you think it's expensive for
what it is and I know that I can get
other things cheaper and I'm just kind
of cheap like why would I spend the
money but if you're looking into it it
is really good and I did enjoy it and I
would take a free one in a heartbeat
next this is a facial cleanser from the
branch first aid beauty I use this and
put some of a scrub I had into it it was
like a dry scrubs for your face and i'm
currently using that in my shower so as
much as this container is empty i'm
about halfway done with it in the form
of the scrub I don't really like this
though the cleanser itself I just don't
understand the hype around it and I
would not purchase those this is a
deodorant from dub and this is the
coolest seneschal I had so many of these
because i bought a costco pack and i
miss them so I will be repurchasing them
I tried to go natural it's not working I
tried to go with other difference I just
feel like I'm stinky girl so we need to
fix that I need to go get a new
deodorant this is another toner i use
death or spray yeah toner from
dermalogica and this is being multi
active toner I really enjoyed this this
is something I want
circus for my pit it smells so nice and
this is part of like the calming line
from dermalogica and its really nice the
scent is just great I definitely think
i'm going to be practices dance not for
myself for my kid I have this mineral
guy from Bumble and Bumble it's the full
potential booster hairspray this is just
like a product you spray into the roots
of your hair to help with hair growth I
just have a few of these samples left
you can get one more less than one with
done with I am just trying to use it up
I don't know if it's giving anything I
just thought why not try it hopefully
doesn't have adverse effects and just
get it out of my collection we're
getting kind of close guys we're getting
kind of close this is some wax from
reach and i really like it we use one up
basically every month this is a shower
gel this is from Laura Mercier i
actually just hauled this and i'm
already down a bit this does not have a
lot of products in it just only had
let's see 3.4 ounces in it which is not
a lot bath and body works ones are like
I think eight ounces and I go through
those in a month so this took like half
a month to use I love the smell of this
this is the cement citron like it smells
so good and I enjoyed this smell on the
shower but this does not allow their
very well and I would almost forgive
that since this is called the cream body
cleanse and I could see that being the
reason why it doesn't film up but this
isn't that moisturizing either so I just
feel like I feel like this is not worth
the money I didn't feel looks to me and
even the packaging is kind of cheap like
I don't know it looks silver and nice
but it I don't know I just kind of know
definitely would never spend the money
on this I have two little sample packets
foil packets and that is so weird for me
the first one here is the clarks
botanicals anti puff eye cream I really
enjoyed the texture of this eye cream I
think it's really nice if I had just 75
dollars to spend on this I would buy it
for my kit but I don't so or for myself
but it is really nice if you were
wondering and this this is the poor care
pack natural charcoal poor thing I don't
know where I got this from this sucked
this smells disgusting you were supposed
to like what your know
and then put this on it but not actually
what the Porsche trip but I felt like
that wasn't enough moisture to actually
stick it to you I didn't think that it
took anything out and then I just
couldn't even stand the smell long
enough since it's on your nose to keep
it all along enough and it wasn't even
sticking rolling just laying all around
deny enjoy we are on to the weird things
now so let's do it this is a rustic bag
that used to hold paper bag I use paper
bags in my kit to use it like mini trash
cans on set I never know where I'm going
to be if I'm out of studio yeah they'll
have a trash but if I'm on location they
might not have a trash and it's just
easy to have something to throw away
like cotton rounds and cotton balls and
all the things that you have all the
little pieces sometimes you just need to
like have them near and it kind of keeps
your station nice and clean so I highly
suggest paper bags if you are make
fartist and need a little trash volume a
weird one these are pain relievers
they're extra strength I got me so long
ago but they realize the classic looking
gel capsules I really enjoyed these
whatever I mean I'm just happy to finish
them I know that's weird I wasn't like
trying to take more pills to finish this
but we have this for forever and we have
like four open so one is finally gone
food I have two food items the first one
is roasted sesame seeds I'm obsessive
sesame seeds toasted sesame seeds are so
delicious we make Chinese chicken here
at home all the time and I like pile
these on there like so many sesame seeds
i pled them i bought a costco pack of
them so i have like a big one I
definitely suggest getting your toasted
sesame seeds there cuz they're way
cheaper this is more like a fun fact
about me that I love sesame seeds but I
finished the teeth thing up in probably
like couple months four months five
months which may not seem as well that's
a lot of sesame seed and the other thing
I wanted to show you guys was the
pretzel crisps and these are so good i
got these are cocktail for 499 and they
are little pretzel thins and they are
dumped in white chocolate has
peppermints all over them they're so
good
dollars you get this massive bag and
sani all of them there's like some just
like chocolate pieces at the bottom but
i highly suggest you use their super
good for the holidays they were tasty ok
there is my random MCS gotten the help

kind of everywhere just because I
filming so many videos but hopefully
these are enjoyable and coming out ok
