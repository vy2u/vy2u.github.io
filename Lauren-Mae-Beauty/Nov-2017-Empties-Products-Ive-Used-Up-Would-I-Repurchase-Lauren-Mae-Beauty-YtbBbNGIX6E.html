you so much for watching oh I didn't
even say my name hi guys welcome back to
my channel it's learn and thank you so
much for watching today we're going to
be doing an empties video these are all
the things that I've used up in the
month of November I will have the
playlist linked down below I actually
don't have too many things this month or
at least it doesn't feel like it this is
my basket but we're gonna get through it
I'll show you guys what I have here real
fast I wanted to say thank you for all
the love on my background in my last
video I really loved it too so I'm glad
you guys do but other than that let's
get into the products we'll start off
with the makeup item because I just have
one eensy-beensy thing incy wincy in see
teensy how do you say that on anyway one
small little guy this is from starlets
it's the eye shadow and pearl and this
was in my finish 13 by Halloween and I
finally finished it so I thought I would
show you guys and let you guys know like
it's done I'm really happy to be getting
an entire eye shadow out of the way it's
already so hard to hit pan on a shadow
so then to actually like finish one up
completely is a super big deal so I'm
really happy about that and I can't wait
to put it in my ear long empties video
will get some of the like common things
out of the way I guess I have some wipes
here I don't know why I have three that
feels like so many probably because I
finished one in my kit or something but
I love these wipes you guys know that
they are a dollar each at Big Lots I
love the a low version they're from fel
yeah I love it
I really hope it's not too bright I'm
gonna film one this way and then I'm
gonna film one I think one down so if it
is too bright it'll be fixed in a
different one or if it's perfect it's
gonna be darker in another video umm
anyway this is something that's in my
empties videos quite often this is the
puff me a volumizing cloud mist I've
talked about this a ton but this is a
volumizing powder and instead of you
tapping it into your hair or putting it
in the palm of your hand you actually
can spray it with the nozzle which is
amazing Sam is the one who mostly uses
this product I still do like I've used
it today but I don't know sometimes I
find it tangles my little hair but since
he has shorter hair it really helps give
him a little bit of hold without being
stiff and crunchy so we both really like
this I have a ton of backup
this is the simple micellar water and I
really do like this but in general I
just like micellar waters I feel like I
haven't really come across one that I've
disliked so I would repurchase this one
I would also repurchase the Garnier one
I used one from nooks once that one was
really good
I've used the Bioderma that one's a
really good one too so basically
whatever I can get at a good price or
whatever is available to me at the
moment I need to repurchase that's when
I pick up I usually always have some
type of Bath and Body Works hand soap in
here and this month I have the
marshmallow pumpkin latte this is my
favorite scent I love this so much my
mom hates this scent but mom I like it
oh it's so good it's so sweet it's so
festive it now like reminds me of going
into fall I have I think three backups
of this in my hand soap like collection
it's not collection but my backups of
hand soaps I have three of this scent
and I love it I'm so happy
highly highly suggest this set if you
can find it at your store or next season
when it comes out definitely check it
out it's really good I did finish up a
cotton round this is thus whispers
premium cotton rounds I get at Costco I
do really like these specific cotton
rounds but I do want to try to eliminate
how much waste I'm creating every single
night using these so once I finish up
the packs that I have now I'm going to
switch over to using reusable ones and
hopefully that will cut down on that but
still be a really easy way to get my
makeup off at the end of the night but I
will still purchase them for my makeup
kit because you kind of need disposable
stuff for that I have two different
toothpastes I think I just forgot to put
this one in last month but this is the
crest complete with scope yeah it was
okay and that was the last one we had
from our Costco pack so when we were out
to CVS we picked up a different brand we
had never used before this is the dr.
Sheffield's premium natural toothpaste
fluoride free in natural wintermint at
first we were using this the texture of
it was kind of weird but I actually have
grown to miss this but actually I just
got the equip toothbrush I don't know if
you guys have ever heard of it but it's
like an electric toothbrush I got it
from octoly and I was like
going back and forth because I wanted to
try it out but I was like and I just
finally was like no I do want to try it
out not only does it look really pretty
but me and Sam's been wanting to switch
over to electric toothbrushes for a
while and I thought this might be a way
to do that so I'm either gonna make an
entirely dedicated video to it so let me
know if you'd want to see that or if not
I'm probably going to put it into my
neck skincare review video just because
I feel like those are the closest in
correlation to each other but yeah so
that's what I'm using now and I'm
actually enjoying that toothpaste quite
a bit but the other toothpaste I bought
before I got that in the mail I'm not
really liking so I would repurchase that
dr. Sheffield's one again that's
basically what I was trying to tell you
I guess we'll just finish up with the
oral care we also have another floss in
here you guys now I love that
philosophorum a dollar store it's just
the wax minted floss next I have a
bottle of 99% alcohol I use this for
special effects makeup so those alcohol
palettes that I've talked about a
million times if you want to know what
they look like
I will leave my special-effects makeup
kit like collection I guess down below
for you to check out but you need 91 to
99% alcohol to make that product work
and that's why I had this so yeah I also
just use that in general to sanitize -
because it's like two-in-one but yeah I
do really like that I just use 91 though
for the most part because it's easier to
get something I really really loved this
was the Moroccan oil dry shampoo I
actually have a new can of this right
now that we're using I love the smell of
this so so much it works really well I
have not used batiste and I don't know
how long because I've just been using
the Moroccan oil me and Sam have been
choosing a Moroccan oil up so bougie now
no my mom bought me it the last one and
I think no I bought this one but she
bought me the last one so thanks mama I
love it so so good highly recommend I
use the light tones because I have
lighter hair Sam also has lighter hair
so it kind of works out but they do have
a dark tones if you don't want to have
like a white cast or anything so if you
have the money I do recommend but
batiste is still a great product and
works really well a dry shampoo I don't
recommend is this AG haircare one oh not
good don't like it at all it just
doesn't work I feel like if do
so much of this to even maybe make your
hair look a little bit more refreshed it
was leaving like a pretty pretty strong
white cast at the end and it's supposed
to be like clear I think I don't know
just I don't recommend this just don't
do it
get the batiste for a cheaper or if
you're gonna go for a very similar price
go with the Moroccan oil next is a
shower gel or cream gel and this is the
sold in Janeiro Brazilian foreplay
moisturizing shower cream gel I really
love this product I think it's really
great it's funny because in Keighley and
live loves her makeup both their videos
I don't know what videos it was exactly
but I remember just watching their
videos and then being like this isn't
worth it they didn't like it um
and I did get this sent to me from
octoly so I got this for free but I
really like this product I am going to
repurchase this next summer when we go
to Italy like I really enjoy it not only
does it smell really nice I personally
find that in moisturizes my skin and I
really like the way it feels I love the
scent memory I have attached to it it's
just like a nice a luxury fun product
for me in the shower and I drew it
another shower gel that I have in here
this is the champagne love a nice plum
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's just a mini
and I actually really enjoyed the scent
of this as well yeah it smells so good I
really like the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works shower
gels - these definitely are very
powerful they're very strong so there's
that if you like something that's subtle
you're not gonna like the scent of these
but I love the way that these film up on
my loofah
I feel really clean again I kind of like
a fun shower experience so I enjoyed the
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works shower gels I have a
deodorant in here this one is from dove
and it's the dry spray invisible spray
deodorant I've really been enjoying the
spray deodorants not only do I keep
these in my kit because they're sanitary
and sometimes people just need to not
smell disgusting but they've been
working for me the more I use them the
better they work I feel like which is
usually the opposite when it comes to
deodorant I felt like when I was first
using spray deodorants they weren't
working very well and so I felt you know
kind of self-conscious but the more I
use this the more I feel like they work
really well so I do suggest these I love
that you can like let someone else use
it and it's not gonna like be gross so I
do have a Wallflower in here I don't
know what scent is
right now this smells like a lemon mint
or eucalyptus mint something like that I
kind of remember that too so I I do like
these but I would never repurchase them
I'm mostly just trying to get through
the ones that I have and last I'm pretty
sure I thought this was in my last
empties but it was in my drawer so we're
just gonna talk about it anyway because
I do love them this is the Crabtree &amp;amp;
Evelyn
lavender ultra moisturizing hand therapy
I really like these hand creams I think
they're really great and I specifically
really loved lavender it is just super
relaxing I put this on at night by my
bed and I love the way that it smells
the way that it made me feel definitely
makes me want to get like a lavender
like pillow spray or something cuz it
smells so nice and those are all my up
T's I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I probably won't have an empties up
until like the middle of January so yeah
which I just realized is not even that
far away because we're already it's like
the eighth today anyway that's
everything I'll see you guys in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
