lauren i thought i would show you guys
what I've used up this is kind of
halfway through november and into
december let's get into what I've used
up in the last month and a half I've
used up to body scrubs this one is from
tree hut this is the Brazilian that I
did like the smell of this it was very
sweet I don't think I'd want this one
all the time I do usually like like the
coconut lime one it's a little more
refreshing but it was nice and I love
this sugar scrub for the drugstore I
think it's great this is one that
doesn't leave an oily residue so if you
like just a clean feeling after you
scrub this would be perfect for you i
also used up this fresh one this is the
original brown sugar body polish this
one was interesting it was very like
separated so the top layer was just like
water and like oil and then there was
really packed sugar and really large
chunks of sugar I love the smell of this
it has this like citrusy lemon and brown
sugar sent it kind of smells like a
really nice tea or something as you're
like scrubbing your body I enjoyed that
this also does leave like a more oily
residue or just like a softness to the
skin so that's something to keep in mind
personally I don't think it's worth the
money like I enjoyed using this product
but I would never pay the money for this
product if I were to buy a really
expensive scrub I just like the low
licious one I just find the particles
are smaller on that one and I just feel
like I can buff my skin better than I
can with this one so it was great but I
would not repurchase we all know how I
feel about these horrible wipes I hate
these I would never buy them they're
from New poor they're from the 99 cent
store do not buy them I have one hand
wash in here this is the bath and
Bodyworks twisted peppermint this was
just like the deep cleansing one not the
filming one I liked this I thought it
was okay i'm not a super twisted
peppermint girl i don't know i know a
lot of people like love that scent and
it's okay but i'd rather do like
spearmint or something like crisp like
Apple II than this again so I don't know
if I'd repurchases I don't hate it but I
didn't like love love love it I went
through an alcohol bottle this is
isopropyl alcohol this is ninety-one
percent I have to use this for school
and just for my makeup kit if you're
going to do anything with like alcohol
palettes you have to have at least
ninety-one percent alcohol to activate
those so
use a lot of it up that way also just
sanitizing my makeup between clients or
between like myself and other people
that I use it on or whatever so this is
like a must have for anyone who has a
lot of makeup this is a razor and it's
gross and it's a nice one I liked this
one and I think it's definitely worth it
to invest in the nice shavers instead of
those like really really cheap ones I
just find that I enjoy shaving my legs
more when I have a nicer one and they
just work better and sometimes I go a
long time without shaving so it's like
we got to work through some stuff on my
legs so I like having something that can
get the job done better than those
little dinky ones but anyway I liked it
this is a real Estelle micellar solution
it's an eye makeup remover or face
makeup remover I really like this stuff
I think that it's a really good option
if you're looking for something but i
think the drugstore also has a ton of
great options so i don't think you have
to have this one i am working on one
more of them and then i will be done and
out of this so i'll probably go back to
my simple one in conjunction with that
product i use cotton rounds these are
from studio 35 beauty which is a walmart
or not walmart walgreens brand these are
the textured cotton rounds it was like
for something for three packs of these
and there's only 80 NM i think that's a
ripoff i know you guys know I want to
pay a dollar for 100 i want to send
eight when i use three I want to know I
use three cents on my eyes not more than
that anyway I just even because I was
like it was just hard to take off my
makeup so anyway wherever you get them
for a dollar let me know where do you
guys get them for a dollar or do you pay
like to something cuz that's crazy I
have a Bosley shampoo and conditioner in
here these are worse things Sam use this
is the volumizing conditioner and
shampoo it's just gonna help keep your
hair longer so I didn't use them but
they kind of tingle a little bit on the
scalp yeah I have a candle from Bath and
Body Works that I used up and this was
outside of my project use it up project
so I'm really happy about that like
getting another one out I will say I did
not think I was a fan of this end I kind
of just bought it because everyone else
hyped it up and I bought this like two
years ago but I did really enjoy it at
the end so i am glad ya 2013 but i am
glad that
I used it up and I did enjoy it so I
would potentially repurchase this scent
like next winter but we'll see how many
candles i have this is the origins
high-potency vitamins it's a night cream
and I did really enjoy this it's all
gone it smells like lemons it's
definitely like citrusy and I think that
it's a really nice cream it's definitely
heavier like the consistency of it is
very thick I liked putting this on at
night especially in the winter time I
like a heavier moisturizer at night
because i don't care if my face is
greasy at night i could just go to sleep
and wash it off in the morning i would
potentially repurchase this Sam really
liked it too it's just expensive that's
the only thing that's like holding me
back like if it was less expensive i
would probably just go buy it but I just
if I'm gonna make an investment like
that I'd rather really test out some
other stuff so I'm on the fence we still
floss our teeth so we used up another
floss this is a scrub this is the
origins modern friction I did not like
this scrub it didn't have enough scrubby
particles in it and it just wasn't that
good I don't I did not like it i would
not recommend it there's better stuff i
like the st. Ives one and it's cheap
this is a coda lehan cream this is in
the grapefruit Rose scent I really like
this this smells so good and I can
always tell when I kind of back off my
bath and body works are really highly
fragranced products and start using
things like totally or even lock suit on
when I first start using them I don't
think they smell good or I can't really
smell the scent and then as i'm using
i'm like halfway through I'm like this
is also just divine and fresh and nice
and I think there's something to be said
about a subtle fragrance that's just
more natural and not so like
in-your-face party boom boom boom it
just smells nice and I really have been
enjoying that that's something once I
kind of use up my bath and body works
stuff i think i'm gonna try to go less
fragrance with my products and just
enjoy subtle sense it I mean once your
nose gets used to that it's really nice
so anyway I really enjoyed this I like
the consistency of these hand creams
their regular hand cream is my favorite
hand cream from daytime this is another
hand cream this is delicious sugar
coconut it's just a little tiny sample I
love this hand cream too it's a really
good one
and I love the scent this scent is very
similar to the body shops coconut scent
it's not too coconutty it's kind of like
it's just a good coconut scent I really
like this this is something i'd be
purchased too i'd love I don't know what
it is i love hand creams even though i
hate lotion what I only have a few
things left in my little bucket so we'll
go over them fast this is just a sample
size of the Anthony glycolic exfoliating
resurfacing wipes I thought this was
nice it was just one wipe one side had
like a gritty texture the other side was
smooth I think that potentially I would
look into something like this but there
are so many things on the market I'm not
like confining myself to this and
honestly I don't know if I'm ready for
that like commitment yeah with my
skincare routine but it was nice for one
time use this is the old henriksen
foaming milk cleanser it was ok i don't
know the scent was kind of nice i did
like the scent but i would never really
purchase this i used up two of my little
samples of the benefit Porefessional i
decided to use these up because i love
this primer and honestly I wasn't really
liking the way my skin was looking so I
was trying to fix that by using primers
I knew I liked and I do really like this
primer I did end up or purchasing though
different primers that I've had in the
past so i just bought the Clinique one
and also the Smashbox pore-minimizing
one it's in a hall i'll link that down
below but i really just i did enjoy
using these up and I thought I have it
just not in a form i usually like to use
just use them up so i'm glad i got to go
through these and not waste them and
then i have to make up items here but
these are just because i'm getting rid
of them i just don't want them in my
collection i'm also getting rid of icon
i have the little one in red from our
glass but these are there i don't know i
think they're like a liquid lipstick or
something the reason i'm getting rid of
this one not only do I not like it but
it's just the wand is so bendy there's
no way that you can apply this on the
lips like it's way too soft and the
other one in icon I think its icon or
iconic that one doesn't do this so I
know something's wrong with this plus
I've just never used these ever ever i
bought them because they were cheap
compared to our glass for only ten
dollars which was stupid they're going
in the trash and the other item i'm
getting rid of this is the two-phase lip
injection color bomb and
one is in like the nudie kind of color
I'm not gonna swatch this because
honestly this product makes my hands
full up because of the plumping
properties in it I used two swatches at
work and it would like her and burn so
I'm not gonna swatch it for you guys and
I don't know why I took this we sold the
last one this is a discontinued product
and I thought oh well take the Chester
home why I didn't I don't know I was
going through my life products and it's
just not something I need in there so
I'm getting rid of it those are all my
empties I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you guys are having a
wonderful new year and I will see you in
the next video hey I'm gonna do a normal
outro bye guys I'll see you in the next
video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
