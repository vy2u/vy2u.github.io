it is Lauren this is going to be my
December favorites video its kind of
november and december favorites actually
because i didn't do one for I don't
think October or November I just
honestly haven't been trying different
products when you project pan you use a
lot of the same products all the time so
I don't want to just constantly be
showing you guys those things when I've
already told you I like them or if I
don't so these are a few of the things
I've been loving the last couple of
months and I just thought it'd be fun to
show you some different things or things
that I haven't talked about a lot or
recently will do all the makeup and
beauty items first so first things first
this is the make up for ever ultra HD
foundation I have the color 117 which i
believe is marble I got this in a
Sephora haul I'll link that down below
and it was massive Sephora haul it was
like crazy and when I got this I was
having really horrible acne on my chin
and jaw area I was really stressed out
in my job and also I think just from
moving here and everything that I was
having very bad hormonal like almost
cystic acne it hurt my skin hurt it just
I mean there's nothing I could do to
stop it and so I bought this which is
supposed to be a foundation that looks
really almost undetectable on camera
that's the whole reason they made this
so that didn't really work out with
needing full coverage and needing to
hide that and using something like this
so when I first tried this it wasn't my
favorite foundation but now my skin is
back to normal which I have pretty nice
skin when it comes to like breakouts and
stuff I don't break out too often so I
have been loving this and it's great for
days that I really want something a
little bit more natural it's been hard
for me to go natural lately I just have
been going like full bloom all the time
and this is also a great mixing
foundation I have a lot of foundations
that I'm using that are really thick or
really moosie and this can kind of break
that texture down so it's a little bit
easier to apply it's not so thick I just
feel like I get a better outcome when I
can mix it with this too so I've really
been enjoying this I'm really glad too
because I'm
a little worried about it it isn't the
best for oily skin but I like the way
that this looks on the skin so I think
it's worth it to kind of touch up
throughout the day or blot another kind
of in general item I've been loving but
this one specifically that doesn't make
sense but another item I've been loving
are just loose powders I have been using
pressed powders for a long time to set
my foundation and lately I just decided
to bust this one out this is the it
cosmetics bye bye pores I just had this
sitting my drawer that's why I busted it
out but it's just been nice to set my
face with something a little lighter and
that doesn't add too much extra coverage
i'm already using so much foundation
that i really don't need to also set it
with a really opaque powder and this
sets it so that I can blend my powders
on top of it like bronzer and blush and
highlight I really like this I think
that it's really this is a good one I
don't know if I say that it covers up
all my pores but I just like that idea
of like a translucent setting powder so
I've just been liking that I have been
trying to use other powders that I just
gently like dab this all over the face
it's great friend of the eyes and I've
just been really enjoying a loose
translucent powder right now it just
makes your skin feel so silky smooth
when you have ones that are so finely
milled like these and yeah I've been
enjoying that the powdery mess is
annoying but um so part of being really
liking the outcome so it's worth it I
have been super into liquid lipsticks
this one I'm wearing now is Kat Von D's
Lolita and then I have two other ones
that I just own in general and I wore
damned in an Instagram post which if you
don't follow me on instagram follow me
I'm really into that one of my favorites
but this is damned it's a really dark
like it looks almost black on my lips
especially because I'm so fair and that
contrast definitely makes it i think
look darker but really pretty i've been
loving this color and I just really
liked the idea of the liquid lipsticks
I've had these for a while and I'm kind
of challenging myself right now to
actually wear lip products every single
day I'm usually not a lip product person
I usually put like a balm on or just
like nothing on
and I just feel prettier and more
finished when I have a lip I feel fierce
and just confident and so at the same
time though if I can't draw my lips on
really nicely I feel more self-conscious
in those lips so I'm challenging myself
to draw my lips on more often so that i
can get comfortable actually drawing my
lip line I feel like practice makes
perfect and just kind of getting to know
my lip shape what I like to do what I
don't like to do and the only way I'm
going to get good at it is if I keep
trying so that's what I've been doing
and I've really just been loving these
liquid lipsticks they stay on all day so
I once I get it right I know that it's
just done so this is requiem over queen
I'm so bad at saying this one if any of
you guys know what it's called please
leave it down in the comments so i can
see it right and then the most recent
purchase this one is Lolita from kat von
d which i will show in a hall in just a
just a little bit i'm filming it today
that's also what i'm wearing on my lips
today I've just been loving them though
I think they're just so nice I really
think I'm going to be getting into more
liquid lipsticks next year as we move
into it and kind of replacing some of
the same colors maybe I have with liquid
lipstick formulas just kind of again
condensing that collection down two
things I love and this is definitely
something that I've really been loving
I've been loving this origins eye cream
this is the ginseng eye cream I have
used up actually a full one of these
before but it kind of has light
reflecting particles in it I've had
issues in the past with using eye creams
at night and then by the morning my eyes
just feel goofy and just not good but
how I've been using this is before I put
my makeup on I'll put quite a bit
underneath my under eye and I just
really like that it gives that area
extra hydration I think I mentioned in
an earlier video but I've just been
having a little bit of problems
personally with my foundation and this
has been helping underneath my eyes kind
of just give it a little bit more
moisture make it look a little bit more
natural and not so cakey and so I have
been liking that
if you have been suffering from you know
dry under eyes even because of winter or
for whatever the reason I would
definitely try an eye cream before you
put makeup on and see if that helps I
have been really exploring my eyeshadows
lately and I just have come to really
love my Z palette and just all the
shadows that I've personally picked out
to put in here I have tons of shadows
that just individually fit in here so
makeup geek I have a couple Mac I have
some mostly coastal sons and then these
ones here are still Ozzy or something
I've just been enjoying kind of the
customization customizable aspect of
this and that I really can just switch
it out and do things that I really like
today on my lids I'm wearing this shadow
from makeup geek and then I have soft
brown in the crease and it's just been
kind of nice to use this and so this has
been a favorite I think I'm gonna film a
video like going through this more in
depth with swatches if you guys would
like let me know that's something that
this year I'm really gonna focus on
since I'm hoping to not buy maybe as
much makeup I'm really going to focus in
and enjoy and pump myself up about the
collection i do have so i'm gonna do
that and also kind of reflect that in my
videos by doing swatch videos of stuff
that i have also like a collection
series this year and i hope you guys
will enjoy that let me know if you went
down below but that's just going to kind
of be a way for me to continually stay
excited about my collection and enthused
and enthralled and what I do have so but
yeah anyway back to this palette i have
just been loving this the ballot and the
colors that I've chosen for in here
another thing I have been loving just
probably yeah the last month since I
colored my hair really are colored
browse and glitter and just glitter
browse and ombre browse and just doing
things that are different with my brows
I think it's just fun I think why not I
don't know I I like it I like the look
of it I've gotten not like hate but just
a few comments of people who just
absolutely hate it but I've gotten so
many of you who love it so i will be
doing a tutorial / like tips and stuff
with eyebrows and coloring them and what
i do and just options that you could do
and things so that will be a video i
will be doing hopefully soon but some of
the products i've really been loving
this is one of them this is a shadow
from stila this is center stage and when
I was more purple I was digging more
into the purple side but now that I have
more pink hair I've been digging into
the pink and I'll just kind of feather
that into the first part of my brows and
like today the ends are not pink I kind
of did an ombre brow and I've really
been enjoying it i think it's been so
fun and i don't know why it's so crazy
to some people i just think of makeup as
art I go to makeup school this isn't
weird like no one thinks this is weird
at my school if anything it's like I
love the brows like it's just not a big
deal and so it's so weird to me almost
are funny that people would have such a
problem with it but when it just seems
so normal in my normal life like when I
walk outside like I wear these every day
like the other day was in class and I
was visiting a teacher and their class
kind of knows me and the girl was like
oh you're not wearing pink eyebrows
today like I don't know it's just just
me and um I've just been loving it so
again I'll get that video up for you
guys I know a lot of you guys want to
kind of play around with it and it's
really simple it's not that hard and if
you are wanting to do like fun browse
just do it try it at home take a few
pictures even if you just want it for
Instagram or whatever and just kind of
like see what you can do it's fun to put
glitter in them and whatnot I've done
like rhinestones as browse like it's fun
and then some of the glitter I've been
enjoying I've been on the brows but also
like in my inner corner I'm wearing
glitter today I work litter in my last
video I've just been enjoying that kind
of bright holiday pop in the inner
corner this is what I've been using to
do that this is a glitter liner from
Sephora and this is the color sweetheart
pink it's just been really nice you can
easily put this in the brows you can use
it as a liner you can use it just
wherever you want to have glitter and I
just really been enjoying this color and
I don't know it's just fun I love having
fun I
doing things neutral or not neutral or
just whatever I feel like and that's
just something I've been enjoying the
last two months or so this is a mascara
haven't talked about on my channel this
is the Urban Decay perversion I just
have the small size here but I just love
this mascara it is so good that's the
brush there it gives me so much length
and like the perfect amount of volume I
just really enjoy this mascara if you
have a sample of it and it's in your
door make it like the next one you use
or if you were wondering about it I say
yes it's so good especially I think if
you really want that length I really
feel like it just makes my lashes look
like I have demi wispies on without me
having demi wispies on and i like that i
will definitely consider purchasing this
once I kind of run out of mascaras I
like or I'm getting low I think that's
just a great one or if there was like a
deal or something it would definitely
tempt me to buy that set or something if
it was a great value so this is a really
good one if you have it check it out
last kind of makeup product this is a
bronze bronzing creamecream bronzer I
want to use this up in 2016 so I have
been just using it every single day and
I really just like the way it looks I
think that it's a really easy bronzer to
cream contour with because it's not too
dark I don't think that if you put this
on it's going to just kind of stick in
that place or not be able to blend out
it's not too dark and it's called a
bronzing primer and I think that kind of
primer aspect to this really makes it
soft looking so that you really can't
mess it up it's just foolproof and I
think the color works nice it's a little
warm but nothing too orange I think it
just gives you this nice warmth to your
face this kind of natural contoured look
I really think that someone could do
like a tinted moisturizer like a more
heavy coverage tinted moisturizer put
this and cream contouring just slightly
set it and then a little blush or
something I just think it could look
really natural but really sculpted but
natural
I think it's just really nice if you
have this close to you get it I mean if
you're not into this then don't but I'm
just glad that as I'm using it i'm going
to be enjoying this product and I think
it's really nice a few more things I
just wanted to mention here at the end
I've been loving Instagram so much it
took me a long time to get an Instagram
I just was kind of resistant and I'm
kind of an old old old old like 90 year
old woman when it comes to social media
and things like that on facebook i don't
really do much here on youtube i finally
made a channel but really that's the
only thing i did so i finally got an
Instagram because a couple of you had
wanted it or were like asking me and I
thought oh I'm just gonna do it and it's
just been fun to take pictures and kind
of document different things going on in
my life for whatever through pictures so
I've really been enjoying that if you
want to follow me I'm warm a beauty on
there and i kind of do beauty but also
just my life so yeah it's been fun i do
a post a day another thing i've been
loving this is adult like an adult
coloring book i posted about it on my
Instagram but i just have really been
enjoying coloring in this i think it's
really relaxing it makes me feel
productive but also creative so i'll
show you a few things that I've done so
um that's just 1 i'm working on so i'm
going to finish that up probably today i
have like a more cool toned one and it's
just been fun to kind of be creative
with colors you don't have to worry
about the actual doodling part you can
just worry about focusing on color
combinations and stuff and I think it
also helps me as an artist with color
and having an eye for color and whether
you're doing complementary colors or
you're putting all secondary colors or
all these different things together on
the color wheel you can kind of just
become more of a master of what looks
good together what contrasts really well
what what looks good this one
specifically is from target it was five
dollars in the little like dollar spot
which is not obviously a dollar I
thought this one was really cool because
it has like the color wheel here and
it's just talking about understanding
color and we already
gone over this like in class because
we're makeup artist so it's really
important to know about color but I
think it's really cool for just anyone
who hasn't had any background like that
to kind of look at this and kind of be
able to pick out what they want their
theme of their thing to be if they want
to just go crazy news every color if
they want to keep it really warm toned
or cool toned or if they want to do like
tints and shades of things or split
complimentary or just different things
and I think it's really cool I just
really been loving it so if this looks
like something you'd like definitely
pick them up there's a ton of them at
michael's too they have all different
themes i believe her name's Margaret
loves makeup on Instagram she has like
one that she said was a cat one which i
think is so cool i really want that one
but yeah they're all my Christmas list
I've just really been into it and I
think it's fun I've only used markers so
far but you could also use like colored
pencils or a mixture and I just think
it's a fun creative outlet something to
do other than watch YouTube or like
watch Netflix and to keep your brain
stimulated but also it's like soothing I
think I'm going to film me coloring and
like speed it up I know that's not going
to be a video everyone's gonna want to
watch like at all but i think i'm gonna
do it because i kind of feel like i
would want to watch that video so maybe
there's one of you out there who would
want to see it i don't know we'll see
how that goes but yeah enough about the
coloring books right enough my last
favorite for this video is going to be
face off i have recently watched face
off only season six and it's because my
teacher my current teacher and a couple
other teachers at my school were
actually on face off like contestants
and so I had never watched face off
before i had heard people mention about
it and talk to me about it especially
when I told them like oh I'm gonna go to
makeup school they'd be like oh like
face off and I'm like I don't know what
that even is but ok it's a really fun
show it's definitely not what I would
want to do with makeup necessarily all
the time the classroom in right now is
tech lab and so that's what we're doing
we're sculpting faces and then
gonna run him in foam and do all that
stuff like that's what I'm doing and so
it was just cool to see it on screen and
I'd never sculpted anything before and
when I started sculpting my mask I had
never watched the show either so
watching it I was like oh my gosh I suck
so much but it's just a cool show if
you're interested in makeup it's more
like really special effects and like
creature makeup but it's really a cool
show and I really just enjoyed it it's
kind of cool to know my teacher like in
person and then watch the show and it's
cool to be trained by people who know so
much about like certain subjects so I've
just been enjoying that if you haven't
touched it out what you're sure all of
you guys already know about it I'm like
totally on the bandwagon there but it's
just been a fun show for me to watch and
I just enjoy seeing other people be
inspired it inspires me I just love
being creative and just on that same
path I guess I'll just say to another
one of my favorites has been I've been
able to work with my school a little bit
closer for like demos and stuff i posted
pictures of that on my Instagram it's
just been fun to do looks on people and
to be creative and be inspired I'm
really excited because I believe I'm
going to be able to do a look for I mats
which is like crazy exciting i've never
been i mats and it's really awesome that
I'm gonna be able to go by doing a demo
look I'm gonna probably be doing a demo
look on like the Friday pro night but
I'm really excited for that I think
that's just so I'm just feel so lucky
and happy and inspired and I love that
it's just what I feel like makeup is for
me so that's just been kind of a wrap up
of all my favorite things and things
I've been loving and things I've been
doing and yeah I hope you guys really
enjoyed this video let me know what some
of your favorites are in the comments
down below I don't think I'm gonna do
like end of the year favorites um for
the whole year just because this year
has been so focused on using up things I
already have that I haven't tried a ton
of things and I feel like I've let you
know about my favorites throughout the
year so I'm just kind of tossing it back
and forth but at this point
think I will so this is kind of my
replacement of that I hope you guys
enjoyed I will see you in my next video
