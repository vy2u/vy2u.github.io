another set of products right now today
guys these are gonna be some nukes
products I'll show you them I'm gonna be
reviewing three different products from
nukes now I showed these in my gratis
haul I believe for June and someone
requested like my thoughts or review on
these products so I thought I would do
that today I've had some time to test
these out and really gain my opinions on
them like I said since these were on a
gratis haul that means I got them for
free did not pay for these items and
it's just because I work in the beauty
industry I didn't get sent them or
anything I just it has to do with my job
I won't put that disclaimer in every
video just so you know so if you're like
someone who's been with me for a while
I'm sorry you have to hear it every time
let's just get into the nitty-gritty
nukes is a French line and they came in
these are some of their newer products
or just products that they're trying to
kind of promote right now or something
that's really popular so I'm gonna start
off with the oil we'll call it a shimmer
oil this is the nukes
he'll put a seed or oil I don't really
know
they have this is the shimmer like
golden shimmer version but they do have
it in just a regular oil version this is
the one point six ounce it does come in
a 3.3 ounce so this is like the smaller
one and just so you guys see the top
there it's just like a squirt off like
grinds me up aftershave or something
I've been trying this product out and
personally I feel like every review so
far is been like it's good but not for
me but yeah this is good but not for me
it's an oil so you guys know how I feel
about lotions I'm not our lotion girl
I'm not an oil girl I don't like the
feeling of being oily or like I can't
touch things because there's like a film
on my hands I hate it this to me is kind
of oily I mean it's an oil what else
would it be so it's just not my favorite
type of like moisturizing product this
product also there it is on my hand it
looks like it has color but if you watch
me rub it in it really doesn't have much
color to it when it goes into my skin
you would you would think you'd be able
see it on my skin of all skin because
it's very pale but it doesn't really add
any tan it just adds like a little bit
of a sheen and then glitter like it just
has like some glitter on it it's a
pretty glitter don't get me wrong I just
wish that it was a little more tan it
gave me a little bit more of like a
globe asides just that like healthy
Sheen from the oil it does go into the
skin quite nice it's just again not a
product that I find myself to use I
would never go out and buy this product
if this is something that you usually
use and I know a lot of people do I know
that I'm very strange in the fact that I
don't like to moisturize but I should
but I don't I think this would be a good
product I just the biggest thing is
don't expect to really get a tan from it
because it's not gonna give you that I
just think it would look great if you
already had a tan say you're going to
the beach you're going to the pool
you're on vacation this would be a
perfect product for you to put on your
legs on your decollete on your arms and
just really show off you know your body
and your tan and just feel really nice
and like look really luminous in the Sun
but it's definitely not an everyday
product for me it's not something that
I'm gonna go through if you're looking
for an oil that does have a bit more of
like an actual tan to it there's a Lucy
be one that's the brand Lucy be they do
an oil very similar to this and it has
more of a tan to it if you're looking
for a tan and shimmer this is just gonna
give you that Sheen and the shimmer so
yeah if that's something you're looking
for it'd be a great product for you
again it's just not something that works
for me
this also has a very strong smell to it
it's not that it's a bad smell it just
has a fragrance to it so if you have the
chance to maybe try this out in a store
or something like that I would
definitely smell it just to make sure
that you like the smell because if you
were putting this all over your body you
would definitely smell it I find that
all the nooks products are quite
fragrant let's move on to the next one
we're gonna stick with the oil type of
products so this is the shower oil with
golden shimmer and I was so excited for
this product because I wanted it to be
kind of like the L'Occitane almond oil
shower oil I
a little sample I've not tried it but
everyone talks about it and I thought oh
my gosh I got like a huge thing of it
it's gonna be so nice and it's a way for
me to kind of moisturize myself because
they don't like to put oil Zahn just
when I'm outside that I could maybe put
this on and if it was too much of a a
residue or something I could then shave
or kind of wash some of it off in the
shower and just have more hydrated skin
than I would have if I didn't hopefully
that makes sense but no that's not what
this is this is just a shower gel it
didn't it's not oil it doesn't
moisturize any more than a normal shower
gel I don't even I don't find this
moisturizing it all really it's just a
shower gel it's just as I mean I like my
bathroom body works once better this is
15 dollars is what it retails for I'm
not saying it's a bad product I just
think that it's misleading that it says
shower oil because I don't think that
it's overly moisturizing or anything you
would think of if you were going to use
a shower oil so it does have a very
similar scent to the oil so maybe it's
just using similar ingredients and
that's where they got the name I don't
know if you can hear the dog upstairs
but I sure can yes that's just my
thoughts on it if you still want to try
it I'm not saying it's bad but if you're
looking for an oil I would definitely
not go for this because it's not a
shower oil it's just a shower wash that
calls itself in a while last but not
least I saved the best for last because
I absolutely love this product this is
the detox detoxifying and youth
revealing anti-aging care serum it's
called the nooks islands detox I really
enjoy this product it retails for $75 so
it is a little pricey but it is a serum
this product is supposed to detox
yourself you use it at night it is a
nighttime serum and it's supposed to
help with cell renewal and just speed up
that process as well as detox the cell
so it's great for someone who's living
in the city or somewhere where maybe
their skin is exposed to a lot of
pollutants I have really enjoyed the
serum it does have a strong smell I
don't mind the smell so when I'm using
it I think I've also gotten used to it
but I don't mind the smell I use
it's nice I do use a lot of pumps at
this I use about three pumps of this and
I put it all in my face and also on my
neck down like even down to here just
because I want to keep everything really
moisturize this claims to make you look
like you have two extra hours of sleep
I'm not saying it does that for me but I
just my skin feels nice when I use it I
haven't broken out from it it's just
been a really good product and if you're
looking for something like this a
nighttime serum that's gonna help detox
the skin give it more radiance make it
feel more luminous and just more like
fresh I think this is a good one to try
out maybe go get a sample of it first I
always think sampling is great so that
way you can really try something before
you buy it and invest $75 but it's a
really great product and I've been
loving it I've been using it like every
single night for like three weeks almost
a month maybe even a month and a week or
a month and a half a long time ever
since I got it I've been using it coz I
didn't have a serum before the packaging
is kind of cool too you twist it like
gosh I can't do it on camera you twist
it like that and then you like push this
down and squirt it on her hand this is a
good one I would definitely suggest it
if you were you know looking for it I
have oily skin but at ninety I don't
really care if it's oily but this
doesn't make me feel like nasty like I
have a bunch of stuff on I actually just
went to the store the other night and I
took off all my drag makeup and I put
this on just this because it was like
earlier in the day and I went out with
it
and it it held up really well I didn't
feel greasy or anything like that so I
really liked it I think it's really good
you can also just use this alone like
just this or you can put a moisturizer
on top of it I do put moisturizer on top
of it when I'm like going to bed at
night just for extra moisture it's a
really good one I really like it and I
suggest it those are my thoughts on
those products I hope you enjoyed this
review the only product I think that's a
dud is that shower oil I just don't I
think it's just misleading I guess is
the best way I could do it maybe it's
like a language barrier or like a differ
it's between cultures if it's like
French and here or whatever but anyway I
just don't I don't find it to be
moisturizing so don't get it for that
but the other two are great products one
just doesn't work for me and one I do
love so I hope you enjoyed this review
let me know if you try to need these
down below in the comments and I will
see you in the next video bye noise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
