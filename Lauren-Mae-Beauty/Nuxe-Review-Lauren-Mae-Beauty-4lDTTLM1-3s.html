Lauren today I have a review for you
guys on some nukes products these were
sent to me through optically if you
don't know what opt is I will leave a
link down below definitely check it out
if you're a creator it's a great way to
find products to review and try out
different products and get them sent to
you for free and no way are they
sponsored this site is super awesome
because it wants you to give your honest
opinion about products and brands want
your honest opinion so that they can
make improvements or just know what
people actually think of their products
so that being said again the products to
have our friend nooks I have one of
their really really cult products this
is the nukes Reve demel probably totally
broke during that so I apologize this is
a French beauty line skincare line so a
lot of the names are in French but this
is a lip balm and then the other product
I have here is a micellar cleansing
water with rose petals i was super
excited i hand-picked these two products
out on the site i will leave the link
for the website listed down below and
for the products so I've been trying
these out for a while a couple of weeks
now and I have a good opinion on how I
feel about these I'm also gonna leave
listed in the description bar down below
some other NYX products that I've
reviewed I used to work at a beauty
store we carried nukes I got trained by
nukes and I got some free gratis
products that way too so I did do a
review on them I'm gonna leave that
listed down below if you're just
interested in the brand in general again
a little bit of backstory I'm not gonna
go too far in nukes is a French base
skincare brand they definitely are more
natural but they use science as well so
they kind of try to find natural
products in nature that work and use
science to help enhance them so that you
can get the best kind of like I don't
know say bang for your buck but the best
delivery system you possibly can with
more natural ingredients I also feel
like a big part of their skincare is
about not only the way that it works but
the senses and how it smells those
natural scents coming through and I
definitely see that in these two
products one of them has the rose petals
and it does smell like roses so we'll go
into the micellar water first this is
for sensitive skin and it's for face and
eyes
I'm a huge fan of micellar waters I love
them that is what I use to remove my eye
makeup every single night and then I
kind of do like a quick once-over my
face before I go in with the face wipe
so I've really been enjoying this one
I'm probably like halfway done with this
product it does smell like roses so if
you like roses you'll like it if you
don't like roses I don't think you will
like it I felt a little uncomfortable at
first putting something scented on my
eyes like I thought it was gonna sting
it didn't sting at all it's never stung
so that's something I enjoy though I
will say again it was just kind of like
a weird feeling to be putting it on my
eye I've really enjoyed this I feel like
it gets my makeup off really well I do
enjoy the scent so I have something
really nice this retails for $20 and I
do think it's good and I if you were
interested in nooks or you really like
the brand I think this is a good product
personally I probably will purchase it
myself unless I got like a really good
discount on it or something just because
I feel like my Garnier one works just as
well at the removing it doesn't have
that sensory aspect to it but it does
work just as well on removing the eye
makeup so I enjoy this it works great I
give it a really positive review but for
my beauty budget at the moment I
wouldn't want to spend $20 on it when I
have something that's just less
expensive that works just as well and
you get more product so it is really
good though and if you were thinking
about getting it it's a nice product and
the second item that I got this is the
lip balm and this is the one I suggest
the most this retails for $15 which i
think is a really good price for the
product and how much you're getting I
don't know if you can see in there but I
do have a dent going in it
this smells super nice it smells like
honey and has like a lemony scent my
first impressions of this I didn't like
it I don't know what it was the feeling
on the lips was not my favorite but the
more I use it the more I really enjoy it
and now I say I like it so I'm glad I
didn't do a first impression on this
because it wouldn't have been a positive
one but now that I've been using it I
really really do like it
the claims for this product are that
it's supposed to nourish your pear
soothe and protect and it uses honey and
vitamin E to do that I really think that
it does that I'm excited
to have this for winter and another
thing I've been using it I've been using
it on my cuticles I've been doing my
nails a lot more than normal and I just
find I'm a picker I'd pick up my
cuticles so when I put this on the night
I put on my lips and then I'll also kind
of put it down my cuticles and it's
really been helping just moisturize but
not too greasy and there's so much
product in here I feel like for $15 that
it's really nice I feel like I
understand why so many people like this
product and I am excited to continue to
use this this is one of those products
to that I feel it on my lips even when I
wake up in the morning and I like that I
like that it's still there it's still
working and I feel like it really is
protecting my lips and just like you
know fixing them overnight almost like a
little worker those are my thoughts on
those products both of them are really
nice I definitely suggest the lip balm
over the micellar water if you were to
pick one but they both work really nice
and they feel good on the skin I haven't
had any reactions that's everything I
hope you guys enjoyed this review and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
