Lauren thanks so much for watching today
this is going to be an empties video my
October empties I have quite a bit of
stuff so let's get into it I did want to
mention to if you guys do like these
losses because I know they're really
cute and I get a lot of compliments on
them in real life but these are from
firmoo I'll leave a link down below I
switch between these ones on my Prada
ones all the time those are like my to
go tues I've kind of retired my other
ones even though partly wants to bring
them back if you guys don't know like I
wear glasses in my everyday life if you
guys follow me on instagram you probably
know that because most my pictures have
my glasses on them but yeah so I just
wanted to mention that they did contact
me and I'm gonna get another pair soon
so i'll show you those when i get them
anyway let's get into the empties sorry
for the long intro i have four different
makeup items that i finished this month
so the first one is an eye primer this
is the Too Faced shadow insurance it was
just a very mini size I enjoyed this I
don't know if I'd repurchase I don't
think I really have them any primers or
at least not just like Matt or regular
primers I don't have shimmer in them so
i probably need to buy one soon or use
up the ones that have or just get rid of
them and then buy one anyway i enjoyed
it but I don't know if I grew purchase
there's just so many on the market I
finish up an elf eyebrow pencil you guys
know I really do like this this is in
the color taupe and it's two dollars I
just can't beat the price and it's what
i have in my eyebrows today if you can
see them over my glasses i really enjoy
this another eye primer here this is the
NARS smudge proof I shadow base I did
like this it was ok i don't think i
would spend the money though on the NARS
one I basically just want to get when i
get forty percent off like whatever
brand i get forty percent off of so
probably the smashbox one or maybe the
lorac when I do like that one so those
are the ones that I will repurchase most
likely but I need to use an eyeshadow
primer no matter what I might just get a
drugstore one and then save one a
high-end one for my kit though I don't
know and the last makeup item here this
is a mascara and this is the x rated one
from Smashbox I got this in my
generation beauty like bag this is what
they were giving out for free that's
what the brush looks like it's like
natural bristle brush but it's kind of
like a triangular shape I enjoyed this I
felt like it gave my lashes really nice
volume and length as it dried out though
it did give more volume and kind of not
became clumpy in a bad way but
definitely thicker part of me enjoyed
that
I can definitely see myself repurchasing
this in the future although my all-time
favorite is the Urban Decay perversion
but I did enjoy it so if you were
looking into it it is a nice mascara and
at least I enjoyed it but I feel like
mascaras are so personal seriously now
let's just get into the rest of the
things in here so first thing here is
the numa shampoo and this is the
moisture one Numa is a really awesome
brand its cruelty free it's sulfate-free
foul 8 free paraben free more
all-natural i'm pretty sure it's organic
like it is all about being sustainable
and good for the environment good for
yourself it has a really nice scent it
only uses natural fragrances like that
are part of what they use to put in it
they don't like add any fragrance or
dies the packaging's recyclable it's
just an awesome brand so I really did
enjoy this I don't know if I'd
repurchase it but I really like the
smell of it and I do think it's a really
good line I know a lot of people in the
project panic community are really more
about like all natural beauty or cruelty
free and this is a really awesome option
I personally would get the volumizing
one though instead of that one just for
my hair type but I got that as gratis I
have to mention these I have two of
these on my empties these are the
marshmallow pumpkin latte hand soaps
from Bath and Body Works you guys i love
this i put this in a favorites I've
talked about it so many times I
absolutely love this I don't think they
have them anymore because they were like
right when they're fall scents lunch so
so good it smells so good I got
compliments on my hand soap my brother
was in town he was like oh your hand
soap smells good when we had a friend in
town he said our hand soap smells so
good this soap is is where it's at it's
a crowd-pleaser I'm not usually into
really sweet scents but I really did
like this one I think I have like three
or four backups right now and I'm really
glad i do just love it but cheese you
guys know I get my petite at marshalls
for 475 definitely pick it up if you're
looking for a great dry shampoo it's my
all-time favorite I wanted to throw the
beauty blender cleanser in you guys saw
that I called a large beauty blender
cleanser that I just purchased and
that's because I was going through these
so this one's done I think I'm gonna
keep the packaging on this I might not
though I don't know it's kind of gross
and dirty and I am enjoying the other
packaging even though I thought I
enjoyed
more so it's my favorite thing to clean
the Beauty Blender was it really does a
great job of just liquefying the product
and getting it out and not leaving any
stains and it also doesn't change the
texture of a Beauty Blender which is
like really important to me I have a
huge sama secrets brush cleanser in here
I know this is everyone's favorite it's
not quite my favorite one thing I don't
like is the cap does not have like any
type of measure to keep the product in
so I find that the this will leak if you
put it upside down or whatever and I
like to keep the big brush cleaners with
me in my kit I know that seems like a
lot of brush cleaner but I either have
this or like a really small size and if
I'm doing a lot of people sometimes it's
just nice to have extra brush cleaner so
this would just leak and stuff and I
didn't like that I also don't like that
this is colored blue because I do find
that it's Jane's my brushes and I don't
want them to be blue I can see that
being a good thing like the pigment
counteracting so the like orangi tones
that you have like maybe it's like color
correcting or canceling it out I don't
know if that's like crazy of me to think
but I don't like when it stains just
like a white fresh blue the thing i
don't like about this the most is that
it clogs up sprayer so i can never put
this in a spray bottle i have sense just
used a almost like you know there's old
school ketchup bottles it's just like a
clear one of those or you like squeeze
it out that's what I use for my brush
cleaner now and it works well so I could
use this in there and I might go back to
this but I don't know I just don't love
it as much as everyone everyone else
does it does dry really fast though I do
like that this is a Holy Grail product
for me this is the bumble and bumble
thickening full for moose I really like
this stuff for adding volume to the hair
you don't need a lot of it I find the
more I add the more just like way down
my hair gets so I just use like a normal
amount you don't have to go overboard
and I just think it's really good this
is my second bottle of this and I'm
using another one I have a candle in
here I haven't been using candles as
much as I I was at the beginning of the
year I finish this and this is the
weekend getaway no endless weekend
candle I don't really like this n I
think I used to but I really don't know
and it had a lot of set obviously i
don't know i love the bath body works
candles but i really don't i really only
need like four on hand at a time i have
hair dye in here this is the color
brilliance I on in lavender this is one
of my favorite ones we dyed my hair
lavender
my mom was in town and its since faded
and now it's mostly pink I don't know I
changed my hair all the time but this is
when i use a lot i have two packs of the
60 count fpl wipes these are in the
green tea I do like the aloe sent better
but they didn't have that one these are
my favorite face wipes you guys know
that it's two dollars like that's such a
good deal i will say someone messaged me
on instagram and let me know that hers
had like molded so i've never had an
issue with that I don't know why that
happened so that's just something I just
wanted to mention that since I like came
into that information I've never had a
problem with molding but if you noticed
that something's weird about yours like
it's happened before and just like watch
out but I checked all my packs compared
to like her numbers that she had on her
packs and none of mine are that same
number and just wanted to throw that out
there i'm still gonna use them i still
really like them but that's just
something to keep in mind like sometimes
things happen I don't think it's like a
major issue but again if you ever find
anything weird with your product like
dummies it it's not worth it especially
if they're two-dollar wife cotton rounds
these are from big lots and I'm going to
get the ones from costco as soon as we
go to costco and actually i went to
costco and they didn't have any like
they're out i'm like i was looking
around for forever oh so upset as soon
as i can buy them from costco like
they're there when i'm there then i will
get those I don't like these i have a
body wash in here this is from Bath and
Body Works it's the French lavender and
honey this is one of my favorite scents
from them and they're like permanent
range it just felt so good I have a
spray of this and i don't think i have
another shower gel but i do really like
this it's a really good scent and i like
their shower gels oh man okay guys i
finished it i'm so happy about this this
is one of the products that it really
took me a lot of time and work and
energy to finish this is the keratin
complex sweet definition texturising
sugar missed I do not like this I use
this up it was in my seven summer flings
and I didn't finish it I was right here
and now it is done i'm so happy this
felt like vinegar which i think it's
just the strangest thing even my brother
when I was when he was in town I sprayed
it in my hair and he's like oh why does
it smell like vinegar in here oh it's my
hair brown
I don't like this and I don't suggest it
but I'm so happy I finished it something
taking up a ton of room are these q-tips
these are just like q-tip brand q-tips I
use these in my kit and we use them just
at home so i bought the costco pack of
three of them just to have them on hand
i go through them quite a bit so i
really like them I find that I do like
the actual q-tip branches are sturdier
than other ones yeah I mean they're
q-tips okay just a few things left I
have some floss you guys know we always
use the reach mint wax floss and we go
through about one a month this is the
way I believe is how you pronounce it
finishing cream I really liked this I
got this at generation beauty this has a
smell kind of like the Chi fragrance so
like I think that's like gardenia it
smells really nice and I did end up
buying the full size of this I really
did like it so I use it in my kid and I
really need to buy another one so I have
one at home and then one of my kit
because I hate going back and forth I
really like this if you're looking for a
product that's going to just give a
little bit of like life to the ends of
your hair or just like you like cheese
it for flyaways on second two hair like
maybe to help tame some what's going on
here this is what i would use and i just
really like it this is the murad acne
spot fast fix I don't really like this
there's nothing wrong with it it's just
I didn't find that it worked amazing and
then Sam also when he'd put it on he
would get like really red around
wherever he put it so I don't think his
skin likes the benzoyl peroxide that's
in here we didn't repurchase this I did
repurchase the Mario Badescu spot
treatment we've had that in the past and
it works so I just went with that
instead this is another Murad product
this is the hydrodynamic punching
essence I believe this is like a serum
that's how I used it it felt really nice
i did like it the texture of it felt
really good I don't think I'd purchase
it like it wasn't like amazing I saw
like crazy result but I did enjoy it and
I could see what other people like it
last I have a razor okay I'm rid of it I
did hear all of your guys's comments
about doing the Dollar Shave Club so I
am going to do that for me and Sam
because Sam also just wants to have like
good razors that you know aren't cutting
his face and whatnot so I did hear your
eyes his cries I'm gonna do the Dollar
Shave Club and just you know put to rest
my issues with it with the razor so
those are all my empties guys I hope you
enjoyed this video and
taking a look at my traction what I
thought I will see you in the next one I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
and I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
