is my October top 5 favorites you guys
know how I like to do my favorite salad
to just pick five items or so sometimes
they go into sex but just a few items
that I've been loving for the month
nothing too much you know not trying to
overwhelm but it's always fun to really
go back through and find the things that
you really were liking throughout the
month so let's just jump into it the
first thing I want to mention is the
covergirl clean map BB cream this is in
5-10 fair it is the lightest shade i did
a first impressions on this i will leave
a link down below since then i have been
using it quite a bit and I do really
like this I think this is a nice BB
cream I feel like the color selections
pretty good I think there are like six
or seven shades which usually there's
only like three shades in a BB cream
overall I just think it works really
nice on my skin I like to apply this I
think best with my fingers I feel like I
can get the least amount of product on
my face but the most coverage I think
the finish is really nice I just have
really been enjoying this it does
oxidize a little bit but I don't find
that an issue for me so I just thought
I'd mention it I just feel like for
everything about this product I do
really enjoy it my next favorite is an
eyeshadow palette this is an oldie but a
goodie this is the laura mercier I
believe artist palette ooh sorry about
that i did get this one it released the
first time and i know it has released
since i don't know if its permanent or
not but I've just really been
gravitating toward this palette which I
find strange since I have all my new
palettes I still use those but I've
really been enjoying the color fresco
here and then kind of the star of the
show for me though is plum smoke this
color here I've really been liking that
kind of cool toned look I don't know
what it is it's grey but it's not it's
purple I really like it for all over the
lid for kind of a just a very simple but
like cool toned darker but not dark look
I don't know I just think this is a
really nice palette if you're into
neutrals but you like more of the Mavi
colors this is a really nice one and I'm
glad to be getting some good use out of
this the next product is something that
i just recently busted out I told you
guys I was going through some of my old
videos and one of them was about me
busting this candle out
we were like doing a Christmas tree and
so this just made me think about this
candle and it smells so good I was
burning it yesterday and I just
absolutely love this candle it lasts a
really long time and I really like this
scent this is let me tell you what it is
this is the Fraser for a candle from
times and this is expensive don't get me
wrong but I feel like it's so nice it's
definitely one of my favorite kind of
like fur or balsam type of sense it's so
good if you have the chance to smell it
definitely do if you really like that
Christmas tree sent this is like
absolutely beautiful and so perfect for
the holidays and I definitely think this
will last us through this holiday and
probably even next holiday so definitely
to me a good investment fifty dollars is
how much this retails for luckily i got
it for 30 but yet ten dollars a year
I'll take it I think that's good my
fourth favorite for the month of October
are these perfumes i got these when my
mom was in town and they're from Laura
Mercier this one is in T month Cintron
citron so hard to say for me and fresh
fig i really like these obviously you
can tell i've been using them a ton and
i use them together actually so I'll
layer them I really just like these sons
you guys saw these in a recent hall and
I'm really happy that I got them it's
been nice to just have a new fragrance
to be excited about these are just nice
fragrances and I just highly suggest
them last Beauty favorite for the month
and my fifth favorite is a lip balm I
actually recently just got this but I'm
into it and I'm gonna mention it this is
pretty cheap i think it's five dollars
or less and it's the revlon kiss bomb
this one's in tropical coconut and I saw
these at CVS and I've never seen anyone
talk about these there in like a brand
new display and I got the one that's
just clear and first of all this smells
so good it smells straight up like a
pina colada it smells absolutely
delicious I love that about it and then
when I put this on my lips I was kind of
scared that I was gonna get a lip balm
that was super sweet like almost like
sweetener I've had so many like that and
it isn't it doesn't have it's slightly
sweet but really it's almost like you
can't taste it on your mouth you can
just smell it it's great so I just
really enjoy that about this lip balm
because I've had ones that taste like
sweet and low is on my mouth and they're
just irritating to me I have a vanilla
one that i'm using right now that tastes
like a sugar cookies on my mouth and I
just I don't like that I wanted to smell
good but I really don't want to have to
like taste it over and over and over
again especially if it's really sweet so
I also really like the texture of it
just overall I find that it's a really
nice bomb I like the packaging on it so
I am interested in getting a couple more
of these I don't know I really was
impressed with this and I haven't heard
anyone talk about these I don't know if
I'm just like out of the loop or what
but I really liked this and I did want
to mention some song favorites I've
really been into like music this last
month I'm always into music I'm gonna
try to list my Spotify playlist down
below because I have like a master
playlist where I just like add so many
different songs that I'm loving and I
feel like I have quite an eclectic taste
I don't know I just like a lot of
different stuff so it has quite a bit of
different things on it one of the songs
you've really been liking is a remix of
these songs still falling for you by
Ellie Goulding it was released like with
the Bridget Jones diary or baby movie
but I really like the remix version of
it it's so fun and poppy and makes you
want to dance it also just like makes me
think of mine and Sam's relationship no
but I just I really like this songs like
what it's talking about but i also like
that just positive and fun and just fun
to dance to so I like that song a lot I
like a woman named do a lipa I think
that's how you say it again all these
will be linked down below I've just been
liking quite a few songs from her the
song new love the song blow your mind
and the song let me look at it I have to
look it up because I can't remember off
the top of my head and the song be the
one are like my top I've also been
loving the song downtown by Macklemore

burgh word for that song i love it i
