is going to be kind of a mix between
october and november empties i was
behind on a lot of videos i'm still
behind i don't know it's just been so
hard to catch up but I haven't done an
October empties video and then I've also
used up a lot of this stuff through
November I've just been like a machine
using up my product so i thought i would
just film this it's gonna be kind of a
long one I figured you guys would maybe
be okay with that I just didn't want to
waste my time splitting it up for no
reason when I'm pretty sure we all like
a long empties video I know I do and
we're pretty similar so i'm pretty sure
you like it too anyway this is all the
products that i'd be stabbed in the last
like month and a half and then i'll do
like one more at the end of the year for
like kind of november and december
enough talking let's get into the
empties this is the woman shave gel
strawberry tangerine from up and up I
got this a long time ago I don't know
what it is but I just don't like to use
shave cream I'm just so lazy i don't
even shave that much i don't know i mean
like they're like almost never shaved
which is horrible for my husband but
they really aren't I mean he's cool he's
chill so but I'm trying my best it's
gonna be a resolution for like the new
year which is so sad anyway um this was
okay it foamed up nice but the smell it
is smelled like alcohol to me like an
alcoholic beverage and I just did not
like that it's not like like a tangerine
margarita or something I just personally
didn't like that so I wouldn't get this
sent again and if you like that sent
maybe like this no surprise and other
Battiste this one is in the floral
essences this is probably my favorite
scent and it's my favorite try shampoo
you guys all right another one again
favorite dry shampoo this is the clean
and classic original oh look and another
one this on is in the fruity and cheeky
cherry sent I got all of these at
marshalls for 599 that's where I suggest
you buy them they are so cheap they'll
ask me about a month I usually can go
through a bottle a month or so depends
it depends on how much it out and wash
my hair that month yeah no surprise I
will probably always repurchase that
product this is something say I'm
actually used up this is the texturizing
spray from unite it's a dry finish
uses it he's been doing his hair kind of
like totally trendy lately and like a
poof kind of thing so he's used this and
I bought him another can because he
really liked it well i still have my
discount at work i think this is a great
one it's kind of like the bumble and
bumble dry texturizing spray like the
orb a type of one does have a very sweet
scent on it I don't know if I really
like it kind of smells like grape fish
or something so if you're really
sensitive to sense I don't know if you'd
like it but it is a really good one if
you're looking for that kind of like
just that little bit of extra texture
when your hair's down or maybe even
texture to put it up you know sometimes
I i like to do bonds obviously you guys
know that but if my hair is freshly
washed I just don't have all this
texture to it so this is something you
could use to get that extra I used up
candle I'm so happy let me show you the
front of it oh there is no front it's
because it was like a three-layered
Kendall but anyway i'll show you the top
of it this one was the three-layer
candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works called we
love fall and it had sweater weather
sweet cinnamon pumpkin and pumpkin apple
in it it smelt really nice I was kind of
over it I don't I love pumpkins on some
stuff but I just like them when they
don't have cinnamon I don't know
cinnamon can just be a little spicy for
me I like a just Apple sent without the
cinnamon or pumpkin sent without the
cinnamon that's just me but I'm glad I
brought this up in the season that was
nice and I'm really working on using up
my candles i was talking to Sam I just
don't want like a horde of candles
anymore I'd rather have like at max 7
really good ones I like and that's it i
don't need 25 I'm like moving the price
only 25 though are 30 or however many I
have so I'm doing a really good job of
like working through them and enjoying
them I just feel like I'm just still am
I declutter path I'm still on my purging
path right now which I feel really good
about I have a couple hand soaps from
Bath and Body Works this is the fresh
sparkling snow it's not really nice and
clean it was good I don't know if I'd
repurchase the scent but it was nice
this scent on the other hand Sam did not
like this is the black cherry Merlot and
Sam usually is just chill about sons he
doesn't
say yes or no I have to be like do you
like it tell me if you like it jeez like
that sent like I feel like ask him from
him to like maybe make a note on it and
you watching american horror story
season full for so if you know if you've
watched it then you know why that's
funny anyway he was like oh I don't like
to smell this one it was just very heavy
it's not a sin chai normally pick up I
think I just needed one more or
something like that and I picked this
one up like kind of trying to go on my
cover zone and it's just definitely not
a scent that we usually put in our our
bathroom it didn't smell bad it just
isn't a scent that we gravitate to so I
well not purchase this again cuz if the
hubby doesn't like it it's not worth
having I have a few have my like box
here i have a few little wipes here i
have these simple micellar water ones
i've never tried them my stellar ones
these are really good I brought them
with me to Peru and then used him when
we were back I would definitely
repurchase those this is a travel size I
brought these on the plane with me
because we did like a little face mask
on the way there and did little eye
patches as well and this is the Burt's
Bees cleansing towelettes um the smell
of these systems that good my mom did
not like these so I I don't know if I'd
purchase them again i just bought them
because they were in this size so but I
used to really like him so I don't know
what's up with that why I don't like
them now and these these are horrible i
hate them the bane of my existence these
are the new pore cleanse and moisturize
makeup remover wipes there's 25 in here
i have another pet going of coffees at
the 99-cent store thinking I didn't have
any we were in Santa Barbara and I was
like oh I need some I haven't been able
to really take my makeup off as well as
I like I either use these my biggest
thing is like my eye makeup like my face
makeup i can get off but it's hard to
get i makeup off with just like even a
pre cleanse or oil cleanser i don't like
putting the oil like on my eyes like my
eyes really sensitive and it when you
get oil in them it's just a gross
feeling to me so i like using a wipe or
like a cotton round with the realest
still micellar water on it to get off my
eye makeup so I was like I'll get these
and they suck and I bought to you
because I thought if they're good then
they'll be fine if not there are two
dollars these just suck they just moved
your
the makeup but they wouldn't take any of
it off so what I do is I put my
realistic cleansing water on top of
these wipes and then use it and it's
fine but that's ridiculous like there's
just no need to have these for that so
don't buy these they suck that was very
intense i'm sorry i have a body wash in
here this is the bath and bodyworks wild
Madagascar vanilla this melt really nice
I would repurchase this one it's just as
a good one it's like vanilla but not too
just like sickly sweet it has a little
bit of something else in there I really
liked it it was good i'm working through
a ton of shower gels there are so many
shower gels I have a deodorant here
which is kind of gross this is the dev
go fresh cool essentials in cucumber and
green tea I like the scent of this i
have i think i'm using one more and i
have one more so two more of these and
then i'm going to try to go natural
we'll see I know lava nila just came out
with like a sport one so maybe that one
is better um I might try that after I
get done with these just to see if that
can kind of like control the sweat notre
but not make me have Alzheimer's so
we'll see this is a face wash this is
the pacifica seafoam complete face wash
it's not like coconut this smell of this
got on my nerves after a while it was
one of those coconut sense which sucked
I didn't really like it I wouldn't
repurchase it definitely felt like a
chore to get through it at the end and
it didn't notice anything special it was
just a face wash i bought this when we
first moved here when we lived in our
old apartment so I've had it definitely
for a long time it lasted a long time me
and Sam both use this but I'm glad it's
gone for short this is a face lotion
this is the dual treatment moisturizer
oil-free this is supposed to be compared
to the clean and clear dual action
moisturizer which means you have bought
a couple of those two very light
moisturizer that's also going to like
help fight acne I think it has salicylic
in it yeah I'm pretty sure not benzyl
yeah salicylic acid in it and me and Sam
both have little mini breakouts and I do
like a lighter moisturizer on my face
especially in the day so I don't get
greasy and I my make up whatever so I
bought this because it was like not even
that much cheaper this is nothing like
it nothing about this the smell of this
is so horrendous it smells like tanning
lotion
and you're like putting on your face
it's so horrible I didn't really use
that much of it Sam finish it up I don't
know if he had his big of a problem with
it as me but if you're buying this
because you think it's going to be like
the clean and clear one it is nothing
like it spend the extra money for that
one because this is just its own thing
it's just a totally separate moisturizer
that just does the same thing as that
but not in the same way if that makes
sense so I don't recommend this I did
not like this at all you have a mini
shampoo and conditioner this is the
envia on the hydrating shampoo and
conditioner I got these a long time ago
from Sam's mom and I brought these with
me to Peru and then I was using the
conditioner even in the shower once we
got back because I don't go through
conditioner as easily a shampoo so hi
I'm done with those there was nothing
really that special they smelt nice yeah
I I mean I wouldn't go out and purchase
on but I'm really glad that I got to use
them they were great for the trip this
is another face lotion this is the
rodial Dragon's Blood sculpting gel this
is a 1.7 ounce I talked about this in a
favorites video me and Sam both uses so
we went through it very fast but I
absolutely love this this feels so nice
on the skin I just love i really love it
i have i think three other ones cuz i
bought a ton of them at costco because
they were such a good deal these were
like with text $27 and these retail for
like 90 almost a hundred dollars crazy
an insane deal so i definitely i bought
basically four of them for the price of
one which freaks me out balazs I mind
but I love it um if you have one of
these you can twist off the cab and get
more product out in the inside that
doesn't like pump up through the pump
which this is like the Cape somerville
type of products where you like push
this down anyway love this I have
repurchased to have a ton more I don't
know if I'd repurchase at ninety dollars
it's so expensive but I do really love
this this is an eye cream from md solar
sciences this is the prevention ours I
don't really like this it just I think
it breaks me out and pretty sure cuz
anywhere I'd put this I would just get
little bumps and then I kind of dragged
it down one time and I got a big old
pimple so I'm going to pass this on to
my mom and let her use it this is like
an eye cream that's very like almost
silicone feeling it feels very smoothing
like that so she got and I came from me
before and she never used an eye cream
before and she like loves it and so
she's like give me any eye creams you
have so I'm gonna pass this one along to
her I think she'll really like it I have
two hair dyes in here this is the Manic
Panic high-voltage die and this is in
mystic Heather and this is the manic
panic amplified and virgin snow it's
like a white toner I used like half of
each of these basically on my hair so
I've done it twice and I so far don't
recommend these because the color just
fades so fast and I just think you
should do something more permanent if
you're gonna go with color cuz color
just fades already and seriously I did
my hair a week after I did it and it's
again it's been seriously I dyed it on
monday and it is Wednesday when I'm
filming right now and it's already faded
so I don't know I just so far I don't
really feel these but that's just me
just saying but I like the color when it
first comes out but then doesn't stay
for even like 24 hours and I don't even
wash my hair I wash it in cold water all
that crap I'm super happy with these
these are little mini travel sized hand
sanitizers from Bath and Body Works I
have a million of these because they
just kind of suck you in there so cheap
they're like a dollar each and I've had
so many of them so I finally use sum up
these are two of my favorite sense that
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works has ever made this is
coastal surf and Sun this one smells so
good and then this one is white pair and
fig i absolutely love the scent too so
these two are done sad but so awesome
because again i don't i don't need as
many as i have I probably have right now
seriously I don't know 15 of these and
it takes me forever to go through them
because I don't keep them in my purse or
whatever so I'm really trying to work
through these can I have two down I feel
like this is like a empties video
sponsored by bath and body works but
that just tells you how much money I've
spent in bath body works like over the
years and this year i think i've been in
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works one time I have not
been buying bath and body works stuff
because I have that much of a horde that
I've had enough hand soaps that I don't
need to buy any more like I won't need
to buy any till probably like halfway
through next year
anyway this is a Wallflower I finally
changed mine out it was done a long time
ago I can't quite remember what this
scent was I think was a vineyard
sun-drenched vineyard or something
that's what I think it was it was on
their way longer than it needed to be I
just forgot about it over in my kitchen
so I did switch it out and I thought I
would just tell you guys hear what it
did was it was spiced apple toddy not my
favorite but I think I have one more of
them I mean it's a nice holiday sense
but again it has a lot of that cinnamon
in it which is it my personal favorite I
had a cotton rounds this is just an 80
count from safeway not my favorite I
just need to go and purchase the
up-and-up ones from target but I'm just
being stubborn this is like a body cream
this is it's like looks really gnarly
I'm so sorry but this is the hex body
butter I just wanted to use this up and
I did I used it as a hand cream it
smells like the original hemp smell if
you know what that smells like it's very
sweet I wouldn't repurchase this I just
have had this hanging out for like ever
so glad to be done with it and like use
it but I mean it just needed to go I
have a flossy floss our teeth that's
good yay I have a few like brush cleaner
type of things this is the monda brush
cleaner this was from I believe Nigel's
I got it for free in like a little bag
they gave me I use this on my brushes it
worked fine I'm not a big brush cleaner
person i haven't had a situation where
I've had to use my brushes on multiple
people at the same time where I don't
have time to like deep clean my brushes
I just always deep clean my brushes like
I always do that I don't usually take
the easy way out and do this and I don't
do it on my own so I mean I do have some
brush cleaner now but yeah I just happen
to go through this fast but it's not
something that currently I need for what
I do unless this is a beauty blender
cleanser this is like old school
packaging because i had my Beauty
Blender that I got in a subscription box
like a long long long time ago and I
just let it sit because I just didn't
care about it and one I had no desire to
use a Beauty Blender now I'm obsessed
with them and I love the beauty blender
cleanser it's like the only thing that
can really break down that product and
get it all the way out where you have no
stains there's no product in there it's
crazy so love this I have two backups
already because I by the beauty blenders
in the double pack with the cleanser
because it's just the best deal that you
can really get I love this I definitely
think that if you have a Beauty Blender
that this is a great product chart is
spending so much on the BD wonder why
not keep it in the best condition you
can for as long as you can and also I
find when I use other cleansers on the
Beauty Blender they don't clean it as
well but they also change and compromise
the feel of the sponge itself the sponge
doesn't feel as like soft and smooth it
feels more course let me know if you
felt that but I love this this is great
I have three empties left and they're
all makeup what's usually do at the
beginning so sorry about that i have a
what is this a primer i have a primer
here this is the dr brandt pores no more
pore refiner i did not like this i do
not think it filled in my pores I don't
think it kept me mad I don't think this
is great for anyone with oily skin
really um disappointed by it it's
supposed to mattify I don't think that
it does it's not like tea tree so I mean
it seems like maybe it's fight acne but
I definitely did not like this product
would never buy the full size and I was
just pointing cuz i was excited to try
this this is my real Estelle mascara I
was talking about this mascara in my
last video this is what the brush looks
like so good I love this mascara i use
this mascara for like six months and I
probably could have kept it going but
it's just kind of time to move on try
other things and it was getting a little
goopy and you know it took longer to
like do my lashes I'm the type of person
that I'll run a mascara I'll have a
mascara for two years like getting it on
there and I just stopped myself I didn't
want to get to that point I love this
stuff I definitely feel like I'd
repurchase it although it's like $32 I
just think it's super good I felt like
my lashes did get longer it does have
things to like help promote growth and I
do think that it lengthen my lashes so I
love this stuff I miss it I like it a
lot it's good last but not least I have
a kind of foundation product this is the
physicians formula organic where light
to natural tinted moisturizer
I did not like this stuff it's very
runny it doesn't give you really any
coverage it smells like chemical which
is so weird cuz it's supposed to be
natural I just did not like it I was
working on this for a long time as you
can see it was in some project pans the
way I move the way moved through these
again horror story season for more
stories before anyway the way I moved
through this was just mixing it with
other foundations I finally did it i
just like made myself used it up because
i had like nothing left and i just
didn't want to keep it in my collection
so this is gone you don't know how
relieved I am to see it gone oh it's so
nice that is everything those are all my
empties I've used up a lot of stuff
really happy with the progress I'm
making on everything I feel like you
know it goes back and forth when you
feel really good in your project pans
I'm feeling really good right now I
can't wait to update you guys on all my
stuff I think I have some really good
progress to show you so those will be my
next videos coming out I hope you guys
are having a wonderful day I will see
you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
