Lauren it feels like forever since i
filmed because it's basically been
forever since i filmed I don't even know
what happened my mom came into town and
I was preparing to have all these videos
I wanted to upload like a video a day
this month and that it is out the window
I've been super bombarded with work
lately I've been working on a lot of
different sets which has been amazing
and I'm so happy and grateful and then
with my mom coming in like I basically
worked almost the whole time she was
here so it's kind of hard to like get
any time to spend with her any time that
I wasn't on set or working I wanted to
spend time with her and not really worry
about youtube so that's why I was gone
for a really long time yeah sorry about
that but that was just more important
than this at that moment so I'm back now
I wanted to do a little bit of a haul
video this is a collective haul when my
mom was here we went and bought quite a
few things I get a protest count so we
went to the pro stores went to friends
and name EES twice haha I wanted to be
able to use my discount and give my mom
I just count and that was really fun for
us to go shopping i bought stuff for
myself but mostly stuff for my kid and
then i have a couple other things from
target and a couple other places that i
just wanted to show in this hall also
just wanted to say really quick at the
beginning i did film a lot so you guys
will be seeing videos from me that are a
little bit older so if they're not in
order or I upload like more current
videos in between uploading those videos
just know that it's because I just have
so many backlogged videos right now but
I still want to stay relevant with you
guys in recent and that's why I'm like
kind of putting this video in now to
kind of let you guys know what's going
on and everything so anyway I hope you
guys have been doing well let's just get
into the hall it was so fun to go around
and go shopping and just buys makeup and
have fun and you know it's nice to get a
discount I don't know why I was still
buying stuff at Wilton sephora I'm gonna
just stop because it's just not worth it
i get twenty percent off minimum at most
of the places if not up to forty percent
off depending on the brand so it's just
not worth it for me to shop at those
places anymore i'm going to show you
you everything and when i use it for and
all that good stuff in no particular
order first off I'm gonna show brush
cleaner this is the cinema secrets brush
cleaner I haven't used this before I
know everyone talks about it and loves
it I was just using like a house brands
like name EES house brand for a while
because I got it free with my makeup
chair but i have been using brush
cleaner so much lately just because i've
been working so much and so i just
decided to get the big one of this and
ask the person at the store if this was
worth the extra money and she said it
was so I was like I'm just gonna go for
it this should last me a while next I
got a setting spray by Scandinavia this
is the makeup finishing spray I use this
to prep and then I also use this at the
end I think this is really nice it's a
nice touch I really like using a spray
at the end of makeup so that way it kind
of like sits and sinks into the face
instead of looking super powdering so I
have been enjoying this although I find
with me like it doesn't control my oils
at all I just like the way it finishes
the makeup I got the Ben Nye banana
powder I've been wanting this for a
while in my kid I do have four other
powders from benign I can kind of make
this powder with those but it's just
nice to have it in its container I like
using this on darker skin tones or like
medium to darker skin tones to set under
the eye and keep it bright but not a she
I've been using this and really liking
it I think the bed night powders are
really nice to really like the trans
list of 12 it's a nice soft finish on
the face I have four of these soft matte
lip creams from NYX I really like using
these on set because they're el liquid
lipstick and there Matt but they're not
so stuck on the lips I think let me
lipsticks are really great if you can
rely on them and trust them but
sometimes if it's a really long shoot
day you don't have time to take off
someone's lip and reapply it or if their
lips are really dry throughout the day
if they haven't been taking care of them
you just never know and I just like that
these stay liquid you could easily wipe
them off but they still look mad they're
just easy to reapply I just really enjoy
these so I wanted to get a couple
different colors and I can kind of mix
these and make different colors this
orangi red is called Morocco this pink
color is Istanbul this is new
is Abu Dhabi and the last one here is
Monte Carlo these are really nice I
think they'll liquid suede ones would be
really similar to I picked up a mac
product while i was at name EES and i'm
not i don't have a lot of mac i only
have I shadows really I got this it's a
blush technically but it's matt it's
called film noir and I got this just to
contour darker skin tones with I know it
looks really dark you can obviously use
a really light hand with this I just
wanted something with more of like a
raisin that type of color so that it
didn't turn ashy on the skin yeah i'm
excited i'm gonna use this tomorrow
actually on set so this is a skincare
product this is the embryo lycée embryo
lease i do not know how to say i've seen
everyone used this and i just thought
that i would pick it up because i saw
that name ease it was only sixteen
dollars and then i got it on a discount
too so i think there's a map version of
it and i would really like to get that
one because this is just the regular one
this is the nourishing moisturizer it
feels really nice it has a great texture
and i've just been using this as the
moisturizer before i put primer on my
clients and i really like it I got a
couple lip pencils from jane iredale
when i used to work at my old beauty
store I we sold Jane Iredale and I loved
the colors of their lip pencils I also
think these are really affordable their
fifteen dollars and I get forty percent
off of them so that came out 29 each I
basically just got a bunch of nudes I'd
love to have the full range of them I
think they're really great liners for
the price and I just think the nudes are
so spot-on so also watch these for you
this first one here is spice and that's
what it looks like this is probably my
favorite one out of all of them for my
particular skin tone I just think it's
such a pretty nude color this next one
is rose and that's it there next to
spice this next one here is terracotta
and then the last one I have is called
nutmeg and this one's just a little bit
deeper and that's it there it's a little
more Brown as well I just think these
are really good quality I just really
like them i think the colors are really
nice they remind me of the mac ones but
they're just a better price point and I
feel like even though I'm not had a Mac
lip liner they're just more creamy but
still really good nude options while i
was at mimi's i also picked up a duo
lash it he said this is the black
version i have had the white wine in the
past and i was using that but I just
like the way the black looks better I
feel like it just high
it's your mistakes butter london with
liner easier so i think i'm just going
to continue to repurchase the black one
over the white which dries clear but it
kind of doesn't I just like this better
when I was at friends I had to do it you
guys knew this was coming this is the
modern renaissance palette by Anasazi
Beverly Hills I absolutely love this
thing it's so beautiful it's watches
amazing it was obviously super nice to
get a discount on it it's beautiful
there are no more words I mean I love it
this is totally I'm Allie and I love
that so many of these are mats because
you can still use them on clients even
if they don't want like a crazy look you
can still use a lot of like these colors
on other people in your kit and it's not
like crazy and I also picked up my
beloved orange soda from Anasazi this is
a single shadow this was in my lavish
palette and it's almost gone and I'm so
glad to have this back this is
definitely different than Peach Smoothie
i'm going to show you them together this
is orange soda and then this is peach
smoothie right here so you can see
they're definitely different this is
like a shade maybe a shade and a half
deeper and that's the like difference
for me if you can see that's peach
smoothie and that's orange soda they're
definitely different and I just I'm so
glad to have orange soda back in my life
it's so exciting only a few more things
left most of this stuff was either given
to me for my manager or they are like
from target that's what ever I picked up
some elf brow pencils I really don't go
to target very often so that's why I
don't have a lot of elf stuff and I just
don't want to like order one thing
online and since I was on target i
decided to pick some of these up for my
kid this one's in the color neutral
brown and this one's in the color i
believe ya taupe i really like these
pencils i want to eventually upgrade to
honest hacia pencils i just think that
they'll be easier but for now for the
price and how will these work they're
amazing i use this on my brows myself i
bought one for myself and not in my kit
and that's what i have on my brows today
that's it no powder know anything just
clear brow gel through it so I've really
been enjoying these although I will say
the caps on the ends do not stay on very
well which is irritating just like cheap
but i guess the product itself is cheap
so it makes sense a few more things that
i got i'm telling you this a lot of
stuff but again most of it is for my
actual kits
not really counting it as products for
myself except the Anasazi Renaissance
palette that one was like for me this is
the next slide on glide on eye pencil
and it is in a silver color let's see
what it's called gunmetal and this I got
just because I didn't have a gray pencil
in my kit and I just wanted something
that wasn't going to be as harsh as
black just an option for that I picked
up another liner this is the Maybelline
eye studio gel eyeliner and I don't like
this I've heard so many people say this
is a great eye liner whoa i dropped the
count I've heard so many people say this
is a great eye liner and I just don't
find that it sets well enough for me I
used it on someone who does have more
hooded eyes but i also have liked more
hooded eyes and I just did not it
transferred and I don't know I just it's
okay and I'll probably use it up but I
just definitely wouldn't repurchase it
because it just doesn't work for
everyone I really want to try the Eaton
clot 10 I target I couldn't pass this up
this is the katy perry lipstick line of
covergirl and this is the color kitty
purry this one is just such a pretty
color I just wanted to add it to my kid
I thought it was just a nice neutral
that could go with a lot of people's
skin tones I just liked it and wanted to
get it three more things I promised
these were all gifted to me from a
manager which was super sweet of her
they're just a bunch of it cosmetics
travel size or sample size products this
is the it cosmetics superhero mascara i
actually have already given this to one
of the cast members on sony as her like
mascara so i don't have to keep using
wands she can just use this it's hers
but she did give me that i also got a
sample of d bye bye under eye i'm really
excited to try this this is in the shade
medium and it's just nice to have in my
kid and then another brow pencil which i
might just use for myself but this is a
cosmetics brow power this is their
Universal eyebrow color they only have
one shade and depending on like how
light or dark you do it it can be four
different eyebrow colors so I did like
two different swatches of it there I'm
excited to try this it seems nice and
cool toned and I've heard a lot of
people talk about it so I'm excited
that's a lot of products actually
there's one more i'm going to show you
my setback that i bought hold on so i'm
going to show you my setback I also
when I was at Nigel's so that's what it
looks like obviously it doesn't come
with all the stuff in it this is all my
stuff but i did buy this to have it's so
nice that it's clear you can see
everything that's in it and this is
something that a lot of people have no
matter if their makeup baby their hair
or stylists even have this you can just
keep all the stuff you're going to need
right on set so you don't have to run
back to the room when you're about to
film or whatever you have everything
you're going to ever possibly need in
here and you can just whip it out and do
what you got to do so it's really
exciting to finally have this I'm so
happy as my face was like halfway out of
frame I hope you guys enjoyed this hall
I've missed you so much thanks so much
everyone who subscribed I'm going to try
to make time and and do a million things
we'll see how that goes and I will see
you guys in my next video I hope you're
