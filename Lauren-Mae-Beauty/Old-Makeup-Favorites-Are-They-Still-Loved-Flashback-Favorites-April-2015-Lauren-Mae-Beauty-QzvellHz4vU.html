Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a flashback
favorites and for this video we're gonna
be looking back at the items that I
loved in April of 2015 so 3 years ago
almost I actually do have some of these
items with me still so we'll talk about
those and then the ones that I don't
have I will try to show pictures real
fast before we get into it though I did
want to do a little self-promotion if
you guys have been following me for a
while you might have seen the vlogs on
set that I've done I'm gonna leave them
both linked down below the first one's
definitely better than the second one I
think the second one for whatever reason
the quality of it is kind of like insane
so prepare I totally understand if you
can't even handle it something must have
happened and I didn't realize so I don't
have any of that footage and I can't fix
it anyway those will be linked down
below so you can check them out but I
took you guys along with me on set I
showed you some of the behind the scenes
it was like a really cool fun thing we
were on location it was up north and it
was a really fun project to work on well
that is finally done so it would be
awesome of you guys that went and
checked it out not only would it help us
out but if you want to see some of the
work that I do as a makeup artist this
is a really good example of it I did all
the makeup and every shot you're gonna
see so there's kind of like this witchy
woman there's a lot of dirt and sweat in
them I did some like dirty hands and
stuff so I'm really proud of this
commercial thing we did Ferrari so I
would appreciate it if you guys could
check it out again the link will be in
the description box and I appreciate you
guys checking it out if you do it means
so much to me so talking about the
favorites video I went back and watched
that video and I just I always have to
talk about this at the beginning because
I just it's insane to see how much
you've changed that's three years ago
and it's a favorites video I should be
excited and happy and having a good time
and I'm telling you I can tell in my
little eyes that I am so sad in that
video and I don't think that it's just
me being more comfortable in front of
the camera and having a better presence
on camera I guess this video takes me
back to a place where I was sad it was
right after we had moved here and it was
just a lot of change and I can see it
coming out in that video so yeah I'm
gonna leave that
you link to two if you want to check it
out but I don't know kind of bummed me
out when I watched it so I'm just happy
to see that I'm in a better state it's
amazing like even the intro when I was
telling you guys about that awesome
video that I worked on like seeing the
difference between me there where I just
started school I didn't know anything
about makeup and then having this video
where I'm reflecting on that video and
talking about awesome projects I've
worked on and you know seeing how far my
channels come it's just amazing so
getting into the product so let's do
that the first item that I mentioned in
this video was the ultimate in tin
blonde and this is something that I was
enjoying too
spooley through my brows this is very
similar to the benefit gimme brow
I know essence has one that's very
similar as well and I do like this
product I don't think I've repurchased
it but I did purchase two at that time
so they lasted me quite a while I want
to say I may be finished up the last one
like last year so they lasted me a long
time I love using a tinted brow gel to
run through my brows to kind of give
them a more you know like fluffy vibe so
I think this is a really nice product I
still would recommend it I would still
purchase it myself so that is still a
favorite next I talked about loving
winged eyeliner on myself and how I
loved the Yves pearl winged eyeliner pen
I don't have that pen anymore
I haven't repurchased it I believe I got
that pen off of hope look and I bought a
bunch of Yves pearl stuff on HauteLook
and I mean that's great I'm glad I liked
it I would never repurchase that pen
today
I don't wear winged liner very often
anymore I'm back in the non winged liner
phase of my life and honestly I think I
am gravitating more to gel liners than I
am to the winged liner with the pen I
just I don't know I like the different
colors and all of that so yeah I mean
that specific product isn't and I do
like a wing long me sometimes I do think
it can accentuate my shape I just feel
like I don't have a ton of practice at
the moment on myself and so if I'm
getting ready I don't want to like screw
up and I look because i tried to do
winged liner so yeah it's kind of still
a favorite i just don't wear winged
liner very often but i do like it when i
do wear it next is something that i'm
really disappointed about because it's
the hourglass palette and this is the
original like face palette so it has
like like a
later in the middle like a bronzer and
then like one of the regular face
powders and I know that I have not
decluttered this I thought I had it in
my kit so I went to go find it in my kit
and I cannot find it I can only find the
blush palette and it makes me really sad
because I do like this product I
especially like the middle highlighter
that's in there I think that was really
great it's a nice like subtle highlight
it has a little bit of shimmer but it
looks really pretty on the skin and that
products super expensive so I don't know
where it went I don't know where I must
have left it um it makes me really sad
though and I wish I still had that I
don't know if I would repurchase this
product I kind of do want to try the the
face powders from hourglass I know that
they're super raved about and I've only
tried the one that was in that palette
so I'd like to find one that I think
would work best for what I want I might
put that in a like you decide what I buy
face powders like that might be one of
the options once I do that video but
yeah I don't have this anymore but I do
still think it's good I just wish I
could you know use it and test it out
right now
onto the first item that I actually
still have which I probably should work
on getting this out of my collection
because that means it's three years old
this is the georgeanna easy liner for
lips in the shade tawny I do think this
is a nice lip liner I just don't use lip
liners very often so that is the color
it's a really nice like rosy nude shade
this is creamy but not too creamy The
Price is Right so overall I think it's
nice I haven't repurchased any of the
other ones I was talking about in that
video like I'm gonna repurchase I'm
gonna purchase all the colors just to
have like girl you crazy no you're not
but I do think this is nice for the
price I think it's great it's lasted me
a really long time I don't use lip
liners a ton but that's all I have left
of it so I definitely have used it I
still think this is a good product I
definitely had quite a few of lip
products in this video the next one that
I talked about was from Stila and this
is the liquid lipstick in the shape
patina I do think this is a really
pretty color it was super popular and
raved about here on YouTube and now I
feel like I really don't hear anything
about these steel and liquid lipsticks
but this shade was really nice
I did end up getting rid of it just
because it was getting old and I just
was ready to move it on out of my
collection the steel formula is
definitely more moosie and thick I just
I'm not a liquid lipstick girl and I
just found that it just feels definitely
heavy on the lips it feels like you're
wearing a lip product and I just don't
enjoy that but I do really enjoy the
color of that liquid lipstick it was a
little bit of a darker nude on me but it
definitely looked nice when I see myself
in it in old videos I do think it's
really pretty
yet another lip product this one is
something I still have from Too Faced
it's the melted lipstick in melted
fuchsia I really love this color I
probably should get rid of this it still
smells fine though and so because it's
such a fun color and something I
actually enjoy I'm not gonna get rid of
it until it smells off but I do really
like this these used to be raved about
all the time as well and now they are
not I made this video right when the
melted metallic lipsticks had just come
out like that's how long this has been I
think this color is so bright and so fun
I love that you can use a very thin
amount of product on the lips and get
full pigmentation I do find with these
though that they kind of dry down matte
like they're not like a normal liquid
lipstick like your classic one but after
a long time on the lips they do kind of
dry down and you do get that inner ring
so you have to be kind of careful and
watch out for that but color wise this
is just so fun and bright and I love
that about it and I also really do love
the smell of them they just smell like
really sugary candy and the last item
that I mentioned is something I still
have but this is this different bottle
of it this is from Moroccan oil and it's
the classic Moroccan oil treatment I
love this product I use it quite often
you guys know I want to talk about
Moroccan oil all the time on my channel
I love the smell of these products and
something that's so amazing and like a
full-circle moment for me is that
Moroccan oil actually has reached out to
me and wants to send me some products
which i think is so cool they're a brand
that I've talked about and bought with
my own money so many times on my channel
I mean I was talking about them in 2015
and it's a really cool moment to have
them reach out and just wanted to
randomly send me some products so yeah
still a favorite still love this product
I have it in my kit as well it's a great
oil for smoothing the hair
finishing the ends of the hair if you
find that you kind of have some split
ends I'll put a little bit on my hands
rub it through and then kind of just you
know tame anything fly aways or frizz
wise I also like putting this in my wet
hair after I get out of the shower to
help detangle my hair and just kind of
condition it before I go in and blow dry
it so ya still love this product it's
great and the non beauty favorites that
I mentioned in this video first was Lomo
saltado this is a Peruvian dish and it's
really cool because we actually ended up
going to Peru later that year in October
and so that was like a really cool fun
moment and I still love Lomo saltado
it's delicious it's a pretty staple
Peruvian dish it has steak and it has
like french fries and onions and
tomatoes with cilantro and rice it's
just so good it's really hearty and
salty and delicious it's like perfect
for a rainy cold day or just any time of
the day but it is a heavier dish and
it's delicious
we've been to quite a few Peruvian
places here in LA and the other day me
and Sam actually went to a drive through
a Peruvian place we actually got like
fast-food lemon with saltado and it
wasn't the best definitely would just
like go and sit down in a restaurant but
yeah we're still loving the Lomo and
then I also did mention two different
shows in my favorites the first one was
Hannibal and this is a show that I
believe is cancelled now I did enjoy the
show while I was watching it it's
definitely very very dark it has a lot
of graphic images there's like something
weirdly artistic to the darkness of the
show and then I did enjoy it I thought
it was nice I would have liked to see
more episodes of it I heard from a
friend that they discontinued the show
because they were getting like copycats
it was like kind of like inspiring
horrible things so yeah that's that's
the show if you like dark stuff you
would like that show look it up and the
other show that I liked was America's
Next Top Model I was like watching
different seasons and I think I was
watching this through Amazon like the
Amazon streaming I do like America's
Next Top Model and I stand behind what I
said in that video saying I wish that
they would cut out all the extra stuff
and they would just be like here's the
challenge and then they would show the
photo she had to show the pictures after
and the critiques and then move on like
I just want a short little thing I don't
need all the other stuff I just love
seeing the finished
and you guys know I say inspired and I
talk about being inspired all the time
but I love these really inspired photo
shoots where they're you know having a
different inspiration for every single
one and I love seeing how the model and
the makeup and the fashion all comes out
into this final photo so yeah it's still
a favorite I haven't watched it in a
long time but I do love the show and I
think it's a good one
alright guys so that was my flashback
favorites video thank you so much for
watching and also thank you to anyone
who went over and watched the project
that I was a part of I really do
appreciate it it's always super exciting
when you get back the final cut of
everything because you know you work so
hard and everyone works so hard to get
the raw footage and it can take a while
to get this footage back so I'm excited
I think it's a really awesome cinematic
piece and I'm was really happy to be a
part of it so anyway I will see you in
my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
