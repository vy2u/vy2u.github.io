Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we are gonna be doing any
flashbacks favorites i sat through
another one of my cringy old videos for
you guys and we're gonna look back at
the items that were favorites in August
of 2015 now my last flashback favourites
was April 2015 so there was a really big
gap of me not talking about favorites I
talked about in the video how I just
didn't have any I was super into panning
at the time so I was really focused on
using up my collection I'm not buying
anything I mean we didn't really have a
lot of money it was right when we first
moved to LA and I was in school I was
working full-time at this point too so I
can only imagine how chaotic my life was
so I didn't have any favorites between
April and then you know the August
update so I'm gonna go through these I
don't have I don't think any of these
same products left
I either panned them or got rid of them
or declutter them yeah use them up so
let's get into it let's just get into it
so the first favorite that I mentioned
is a chlorine dry shampoo so I'll leave
a picture up here this is something that
I bought because at the time I was
working at a beauty store and I remember
that was one of our best sellers and the
one that a lot of people at the store
would recommend and it was something
that I had heard about in the beauty
community but never tried and so I
talked about how I got it for two for 30
and then I used my 30% off discount to
get it for even cheaper so that's how I
tried it out and I really liked it I
even said that I liked it a little bit
more than my batiste and if you guys
know me you know that petite is like my
jam it's like what I use it's my go-to
because it's inexpensive I love that it
doesn't have like any aluminum in it and
it's great it works so well so it's like
heresy that I even said that in that
video because it's not something that
every purchased I know a ton of people
love the chlorine dry shampoo though
it's not that it's not good it's not
that I wouldn't be willing to try it out
if it was like free or something like
that but for me if I'm gonna go high-end
I'm gonna spend a lot of money on a dry
shampoo I'm just gonna go with my
Moroccan oil because it smells so
freakin good it's like hair perfume and
it gives you dry shampoo and refreshes
your hair it's just like so amazing so
if I'm gonna go expensive that's what
I'm going for and if I'm gonna go cheap
then batiste is the way to go so
I probably wouldn't purchase that again
but I did enjoy it and I do think it
works well moving on to my next favorite
it's still a favorite this is actually
something I still like in its mac fix+
this is a different bottle than the one
that I used there but I really love this
this is one of my favorite like setting
type of sprays I don't feel like this is
going to make your makeup last any
longer but it does just leave such a
beautiful finish on the skin it really
combines your powder with your
foundation and just leaves you looking
seamless so if you were still wondering
if this is good I know it's a Holy Grail
I know that so many people love it it's
highly raved about if you were still
wondering if it's good like it is it
smells amazing I was raving about that
in the video and yeah it smells so good
don't get the coconut one don't be
tempted because that one smells
literally disgusting like it does not
even remotely smell like coconut to me
yeah the original is just the best one
so go for it it's so good you will not
regret it
I promise it's so so good I have to say
that I am still definitely getting used
to this camera it is so weird that I
don't have like a big ol monitor because
this just has it on the side I don't
have to worry about like being in focus
or not the lighting is so messed up and
then I was editing through footage that
I filmed with this and my goodness you
can see every effing pore every little
thing on my face so y'all be kind be
nice to me I'm like no wonder people use
filters because this is real life
and it's like it's just like
intimidating to upload your face when I
mean that's what it looks like don't get
me wrong I feel like I look pretty in
real life but on camera it transforms
into like whoa I feel like my camera is
like extra crispy - I don't know what's
going on but I'm working on it so just
like forgive me just be nice to me like
anyway moving on to my next favorite I
talked about the covergirl and Olay
simply ageless I cannot say it
foundation this is in a like compact and
it's a cream foundation it has that
swirly you know I'm talking about where
it's like foundation and lotion and I
remember really loving this my last
memories of it as I finished it up I was
like sad that it was gone this is
something I'm actually like I've been
considering repurchasing because I
remember loving it so much and I am
really into cream foundation
I love like cream stick foundations I've
really loved my NARS foundation so I
feel like I might really like this one
again so I'm considering purchasing it
it's just so frickin expensive that
foundation is like 16 plus dollars at
the drugstore and I know you can get
deals and like wheel and deal and like
figure out a way to get it cheaper but
you know just looking at the price tag
just scares me away immediately like I'm
not even ready to do the calculations to
try to get it down because I'm just like
nah I'll pass but I remember it being
really really good I remember also using
it with my Beauty Blender and I loved it
that way it was just so simple and easy
its compact so mmm yeah I think I'm
gonna repurchase that one hopefully I
like it just as much as I used to
the next product that I talked about
being a favorite in general I was just
into cream products and I was really
into cream contouring so I had a nude
stick concealer in the shade number 8
which I believe is the darkest shade and
I was using that to cream contour my
face I talked about how I went on a
little date and I felt all hot and like
with Sam and I do really love cream
contouring slash bronzing you guys know
that I love the milk makeup bronzer
stick that one is so good and I do
remember liking the nude sticks ones I
like nude sticks in general I really
like their products but I would be more
apt to try one of their bronzing sticks
now instead of a concealer using it as a
contour not that there's any problem
doing that I just you know would
probably go that route because I'm not
super into contouring I'm more into just
like lightly sculpting and just giving
my face dimension with bronzer so yeah
that was a good one I would love to have
one of the nude sticks concealer pens
that would be nice
I would get one of those and this is if
we had endless money you know you know
how it goes alright next in my
favourites video where these steal sec
sticks these are like cream sticks and I
bought them for my kit I got them at
Nigel's they were half off because they
were being discontinued I had them in my
kit and I love them so much I used them
for male grooming they were perfect for
adding like some perfection but nothing
too much they were very light coverage
they didn't get greasy like I loved
these things but sadly you know they're
discontinued I mean I understand why
they discontinued them because it's not
really some
a lot of people like I believe when they
came out to that was when CC creams and
BB creams were like the thing do you
guys remember that like every brand is
coming out with it it's like dd cream
like what's going on so I'm sad but I
understand it I love them though I
didn't finish them up but they did get
expired because of the SPF and it was
just - it was just time to let them go
so I have gotten rid of those since then
but they were one of my favorite
products I really enjoyed them they were
good moving on the next item I had in my
favorites was the Smashbox contour
palette in light you guys I completely
panned that bang what what I know it's
funny I don't know it's crazy when I
looked back at these videos too because
I really was into panning I was like so
into it as much as I still do panning
and projects and stuff on my channel now
I'm just not this in the same mindset
like I was more obsessed with panning
and right now I feel like I'm trying to
strike a balance of like getting new
things and trying things that are
actually exciting to me and that I enjoy
but also trying to use things up in a
relatively you know decent amount of
time not letting things just collect and
also declutter and getting rid of things
that don't fit me anymore
but at this time I was so into it and
thinking back like holy crap I finished
up a whole contouring palette the light
shade the bronzer and the contour like
damn girl
good I would love to have some progress
like that I think I'm gonna do a video
about like products I'm almost finished
with just to give me like a little bit
of you know going I know I'm like
finishing up my forgotten loves project
pan which I don't know when this videos
gonna go up because I'm pre filming
because I'm going to Oregon soon I'll be
an organ probably when this is up so
yeah um anyway I don't even know where I
was going with that like it's totally
gone I finished up that contour palette
I loved it I really enjoyed it my makeup
style was quite a bit different than I
was a lot more heavy-handed with
products and powders and bronzers and
just everything so I'm not sure how much
I would love it now but I do remember
really loving it and so I would love to
get like a smaller size of that or try
it out again because it was something
that I loved I love that contour color
in there that one is really nice I
really do think that it's one of those
products that even though my Styles
changed it's just a good product
and I would just use it differently like
less product and you know lighter handed
and I would really enjoy it so yeah I
think that one's still a favorite I
would still recommend that to someone if
they were like hey should I get this I
would say yeah go for it we have two
more products to talk about the next one
is from Josie Maran and this is the
water coconut water eyes shadow
I loved this I had Playa del pink and it
was so pretty I really did love it but
if you guys have seen my packaging petit
stag which I know a lot of you guys have
that one has like so many views it was
so weird that one like blew up a little
bit I'm like this is so old and I look
so insane like if that's the first video
you saw me in my makeups kind of it's
very me but it's like it's a it's a very
blunt introduction to my makeup style I
feel like anyway I talked about in that
video how the freaking Jo foot on it
fell off into the water and I was pissed
about it because those are so expensive
they're like 18 19 dollars I don't even
think they make them anymore
but there was definitely a packaging
flaw so many of you guys told me that
you guys had that happen to you when you
had him I specifically remember
kathleenlights talking about these and I
had two colors I had like the rose gold
one as well I really did like them I
thought they were really great I would
have liked if that wasn't an issue and I
would I would potentially like have
these in my collection again they were
so pretty and so metallic and just kind
of effortless so it's a favorite with a
stipulation and the last thing is the
only thing that I actually have like the
same product of this is the Sigma large
angled contour brush and I actually was
using it for contour in the video
whereas right now I do use this for
blush I've been using this for blush for
a really long time like I said I was
like into contouring this is so I was
using this for contour into the back of
the hairline and like blending up and
stuff and I really enjoyed it I could
see it working really well for that I
usually go for something I think a
little bit smaller now just because I
just want more precise application and I
was talking about how this was precise
so I've definitely gotten to even a
smaller brush for contouring but I do
think this is nice I mean it's what it's
intended for it's called the large
angled contour brush but I love that
brush I've used it for forever I've had
that for years and years and years and
the last couple of things
that I mentioned aren't products but
they were just like other favorites the
first one was x-files I remember being
so freaking into x-files I just all of
us I didn't started watching it I think
because Fox was like redoing x-files so
I was like I'm gonna watch it I'm gonna
like get caught up and like be ready for
it
I didn't get through him because they
were so frigging bene and then not that
my love has died out because I really do
like the x-files but I just it was just
so many freakin episodes and so I
remember though I was in makeup school
at the time and we were working on
projects and getting ready for our final
so I was like literally watching it in
class as I'm like gluing things together
for my project and yeah I freaking I
loved it I loved the big spells I talked
about how I wanted if I could have one
makeup job like if I could work on any
show I said the x-files which now I'm
like I don't do special effects like I
don't want to do that type of makeup I
would just want to because I loved the
x-files like it has nothing to do with
the actual makeup I just want to be a
part of the x-files you know but yeah I
loved it I still think it's great it's
like it's a great show and the last
favorite that I had was Drake's new
album which at the time I believe was
views I never mentioned the album name
at all in the video so I'm assuming it
was views at the time because I'm like
sitting on a different area in my house
and I'm pretty sure that's the one it
was it wasn't it's too late or like if
you're reading this it's too late it
wasn't that one it definitely wasn't the
one he did with future I freaking hate
that album anyway uh yeah I loved views
I loved Drake like I talked about drink
all the time I have a feeling he'll be
like in my favorites video like every
third favorites video because he comes
up with he just work so much he puts out
so much music I just love him I love him
so much
so so good you guys haven't listened to
Drake like what get your life together
and have a listen alright guys so those
were my flashback favorites to August
2015 it's so weird to see that 2015
because we're in 2018 now what the heck
it's crazy I'm kind of chatty today if
you can't tell because I'm kind of
nervous
I'm going to a I'm going to my first
event today it's really weird to say
that and it's not like a big deal but
it's like pure lease invited me to this
like bikes and beauty thing so by the
time you see this it already happened so
like hopefully well
but I'm so nervous I know it's like the
lamest thing ever but I am very nervous
and yeah we're like doing a spin class
and I'm I'm like how are people gonna
dress for this thing are people gonna
like actually wear stuff for like a spin
class or like are you gonna be like
glammed up I'm not wearing this makeup
to it I'm going to kind of go a little
bit more low-key like cute but still
like more chill like I'd rather be
dressed for the spin class than like
dressed like I'm going out you know but
yeah I don't know anyone going I don't
think well maybe that'd be cool if I
like was like oh hey but I don't think I
know anyone going on guys I film videos
in my house like and that is like a lot
for me I'm so like going out and like
not knowing anyone like obviously I'm
gonna do it cuz I'm gonna push myself
but I'm like nervous but I'm going I'm
