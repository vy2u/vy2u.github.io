Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing another
flashback favorites video this is where
I go and revisit favorites videos of the
past I only have one other video like
this I'm gonna leave that link down
below but I was mistaken I thought that
was my first favorites video I've ever
done in my channel which was in March
but it wasn't I had one in February so
we're gonna be going back to the actual
first one today which kind of is cool
because that is in February it's
February it's like a 3-year circle this
was in 2015 I want to say really fast
too I asked you guys if you knew who
started these videos and a lot of you
guys mentioned a beauty by Emily Fox so
I'm gonna leave her channel link down
below I'm also gonna leave Marni
Goldberg those are like the two top ones
a lot of people do this I just didn't
know if there was someone who was like
you know really famous for starting them
but I'm gonna leave them link definitely
go check them out I'm gonna make sure I
check them out too I need to do that
still but other than that let's get into
the favorites that I had in February of
2015 and see if they're still favorites
because that is something that's been so
interesting about the series already is
how much I have changed not only my
presence on camera when I go back and
look at these old videos which that
video will be linked down below if you
want to check it out but also just my
preference in makeup how I like to apply
makeup what products I think are great
and just my mentality overall in this
favorites video I can tell that I'm very
much still just like so in love with me
and I don't say that meaning I'm not in
love with makeup now but I'm just more
critical I'm not just like blown away by
everything I see I don't just think it's
a shimmery beautiful shadow and I love
it I don't think that anymore so I can
tell that I've just grown so much just
being out here starting my channel
project panning and then going the
opposite way and kind of just finding my
balance still but let's just get into
the product the first thing that I had
mentioned in that video was a talent
this is a palette that I bought off of
Etsy and you can put your single shadows
in it which i think is really awesome
mine is pretty dirty and it's empty at
the moment I really do still enjoy this
palette I'm glad I have it I think it's
beautiful I do have a few issues with
this as I've used this more when it
comes to practicality you guys know that
I
love single shadows I do a lot of Duke
videos with my single shadows and I love
the idea that you can put shadows on
both sides but I just feel like it's
just a delicate situation I don't want
them to obviously be crushed into a
million pieces so I feel nervous about
that and I think one of the reasons that
is it's not only because they're like
hanging above each other but the magnet
on here is not insanely strong when I
stick something in my Z palette and then
I move that shadow and stick it in here
it is not the same strength of the
magnet if this had a stronger magnet
face I feel like I could use this a lot
more but because it doesn't I don't want
to travel with it I don't want to like I
don't know I just feel nervous to pass
things in here for too long of a time so
because of that I can't really use this
every day because your everyday stuff
you use and abuse and you just kind of
like you know not being super gentle
with this I have to be more specific
about when I use this and what shadows I
put in it and that can just be kind of
tiring and also not making me reach for
this as much so with time I definitely
don't think of this as fondly I still
think it's absolutely beautiful I feel
like this is just a like you know it's
not a love any more next on the list I
had some Bobby Brown blush palettes I
bought these right after I moved to LA
and I bought all three of them these are
for oh man it's hilarious watching
myself back um so I had mentioned in
that video like these aren't that bad of
a price they're 45 each looks like
watching that and being like girl I'm
sorry say that again it's just taking me
back to the days when I would make like
two hundred and three hundred dollar
purchases on Spore without even like
thinking about anything that I got it's
all just like brand-new stuff because
it's new anyway um I had these in my kit
so I haven't been using these on myself
and honestly I haven't been using them
in my kit that much I think these are
really beautiful so let me tell you what
they are they are the I don't know
they're just the cheek palettes it came
out for a collection that spring or so
and they have three different colors
this one is the berry cheek palette
which I think is beautiful this looks
really nice on like deeper skin tones I
this one here which is the Calypso cheek
palette which is the first one I bought
and then I ended up going back and
buying the other two and then this one
here is the pink cheek palette and this
one is more of the cool tone things so I
think these are great I actually
recently moved these out of my kit
because I haven't been using them in
their I tend to reach for the least
amount of products possible when it
comes to my kids so I love having bigger
palettes things that have a lot of
products in them and honestly when
you're doing makeup on a bunch of
different people you think like oh I
want all these different options and you
do you want options for different skin
tones but honestly you also reach for a
lot of the same colors and you don't
need to switch it up like if if that's
your favorite blush you like to use on
people and it works for a majority of
the people you're probably gonna reach
for that one every frickin time unless
you're doing something more specific or
whatever and a lot of the times if I'm
doing makeup just like that is natural
or for like TV and film it's not for
anything super glam more specific or
editorial or anything like that so I
just found it wasn't reaching for these
I wasn't pulling these out I was using
my Tarte like color wheel one I used the
Stars palette that I have in there so I
thought it would take them out and try
to use them on myself and just free fall
in love with them I spent a lot of money
on these and I would love to get more
use out of them so that's something I'm
gonna do I can't even tell you if these
are still loved because it's been such a
long time and I haven't used them
consistently in a really long time
alright so the next thing I was just
absolutely in love with were the Urban
Decay moon dust shadows which is not the
case anymore necessarily I think these
are pretty don't get me wrong I don't
even own all the ones that I used to
hone I bought this whole palette and it
had four single so that means I spent
$80 on some Urban Decay moon dust
shadows help me guys help me this breaks
my little heart looking back yeah okay
so I talked about solstice which was
like my favorite one and I really think
solstice is a beautiful color I don't
have anything quite like it if you have
the huda beauty desert dust palette I
believe retrograde is really similar to
this I believe but I also have the shade
glass bowl which i think is pretty
similar as well without the glitters so
that's kind of a nicer one and when I
use more I feel like and then the only
other one that I kept out of the four
was cosmic and that's because it's just
like a light shimmery shade I like using
this in winter or when I'm doing
something really cool tone and I want
something just like light and bright and
just a pop on the inner corner would I
purchase these again like given the
chance I had $80 and out and they were
like hey you have $80 do you want to
purchase these I probably wouldn't it's
not that they're bad I just don't reach
for them enough for the price they
aren't just like I'm just not madly in
love with them I'd rather do glitter in
one of the Urban Decay clutter liners I
just think that's just way easier
something that I have changed I think a
lot about myself is I don't spend as
much time getting ready anymore I tried
to do different looks here on camera and
I like to do different looks when I'm
just experimenting but I don't
necessarily do more technical looks
that's just not my style and I find that
a lot of times glitter and things like
that just require you to be a little bit
more technical you have to have the
glitter glue and all the stuff and she's
like a whole production and so yeah I
just haven't reached for these nearly as
much as I should have in the last two
years for them to be in a favorites
video so yeah I like them I think that
there are definite ways you can use them
I can understand why people would like
them if you're going for a very specific
look using them I think it's probably
gonna turn out really awesome and really
bomb are they a favorite no I'm just I'm
more picky about what a favorite is to
me now for sure but I say that and I'm
so interested to see coming back to the
videos I'm making now and how much I've
changed even then like that's just time
that's the weird thing about YouTube is
these are like weird video diaries and
you say something and it's set in stone
and we're always change I'm changing all
the time every day like I I hear
something else and have a different
opinion or you know everything's just
kind of morphing and shifting and so
over two years that happening every
single day every single week every
single month it's crazy to see how
different you are so the next item I had
in here or something I don't have
anymore this is a Sephora eyeshadow they
came out with this like mermaid
collection that was six or seven
different eyeshadows they were all
singles and they were all air dusting
and I
every single freakin one of them and
they're all gone I've decluttered every
single frickin one of them so yeah
definitely not a favorite I did use the
one that I specifically mentioned the
most it was like a gray that turned kind
of silver in blue I believe makeup geeks
kaleidoscope I have it in a pressed form
but I think you can get it in a loose
pigment that is very similar to that
color and it's pretty it was really
pretty but it's like not a favorite the
next item I mentioned was a Jessie girls
pigment and this was something that I
did use quite a bit back then this is in
the shade Sunset Boulevard it's a really
pretty pinky gold it reminds me of the
Carli bybel color in that palette it
reminds me of the hooter rose gold like
color in the palette
I think it's called angelic or something
it's really beautiful really sparkly
really fun I just tend to not really
reach for loose pigments but I do want
to use this more don't know again if I
put it in the favorites video but I
guess that's something like it's a
favorite of that time it's a favorite of
that month I don't know it's not that
quality or anything so I do want to do
maybe a tutorial or something with this
I think it would pair nicely with me
using my Smashbox ablaze palette which
I'm going to be using a lot in the next
few months so I do want to try this out
again I don't know if I'd call it a
favorite I just I really think I think a
favorite does like holy grails like I've
used a whole one up and I'm like on my
second one or things that I would
repurchase if everything burned down in
a fire or if I'd lost everything like
things I would have purchased those are
what I would I think of like as
favorites but I guess in my favorites
videos now I still do mention things
that are more timely favorites like oh
I've really been enjoying it this month
but I don't know if you happen to go
back and watch that video let me know
what you guys think coz I'm sure you see
an insane change or at least for sure I
do alright next I mentioned some of the
lorac pro matte lip pencils I remember
buying a lot of these right before I
moved here to California because this
video okay you guys didn't know I used
to live in Arizona and me and my husband
moved out here for him to act we moved
out here on the Superbowl Sunday
February 2nd of 2015 and I post that
video about February favorites so you
know we'd only been out here a month and
I talked about
a little bit at the end but I remember
buying a lot of these right before I had
moved out here I had bought some and
then I think I made an order and like
had some sent to me when I moved here so
the only one I have left from that
original video is the matte lip color in
pink taupe this is really pretty I
really do like the formula I think these
might have gone up in price but I do
think they're good they're definitely
not talked about as much as they should
be because they're great since that
video I did pick up a few more of these
these came in a holiday set not this
year but the year before
and sadly I mean I got these on a great
deal because I had my pro discount and
they're already an amazing deal in the
set but they're just not the colors I
really want so this one here is the
shade burgundy wine which that one's not
bad this really pink one is the shade
Italian rose and I don't know maybe I
should bust these out and try to wear
them a little bit more I'm a little bit
more adventurous than I think I was and
then the other one here is the shade
autumn and this is a really like orange
a nude like a warm nude so yeah I do
think these were a different formula
than the original ones I decided to
bring out the pencils I prefer over
those if you really wanted to know these
are the buxom lip pencils I love them so
much and dolly is my absolute favorite
color if you're gonna pick one up this
is the one I suggest that's it there
it's really similar to pink taupe but I
still prefer dolly
I have San Francisco which is the newest
one to my collection and this one is
nice I don't know it's okay
it's not my favorite for whatever reason
it's it's insane how subtle the
difference for me on my lips can like
make everything like make or break it
and then I also have the shade Sydney
which is the most nude out of all of
them and yeah if you're gonna pick
something up I suggest these over the
lorac ones but I do think the lorac ones
are good if you're gonna pick a much all
right the next things that I mentioned
in the video where the wet and wild
velvet matte lip colors and I don't have
any more of these anymore I have a
feeling that these are discontinued and
these are part of like the Fergie
collection which is no longer a thing I
I enjoyed these and I still have fond
memories of them I felt like the reviews
on them were kind of mixed I don't know
I just remember seeing reviews being
like they're not good but I enjoyed them
I thought they were nice the biggest
issue I had with them is that they did
dry up and kind of get removed from the
base so you know like they're an
inexpensive cheap little pencil but
that's still a problematic thing so I
remember that being an issue but I don't
think you can get them anymore I don't
think they sell them anymore so it
doesn't really matter we shouldn't
really talk about them they're extinct
next I talked about the simple micellar
water it was the first time I had tried
it and I put it in the favorites because
I had been using the Bioderma for so
long before that it's like I can barely
remember this time it's so weird I'm
just so used to being here and living in
a letting you like it is just so weird
looking back okay anyway I do really
like the simple my solar water I bought
a ton of Costco in general though I mean
I mostly like micellar waters just most
of them work well I haven't really met
one that I just hate so I do suggest
this one I also like the Garnier one I
do like Bioderma I just like micellar
waters in general because they aren't
greasy as a makeup remover on the eye I
just don't need something that hardcore
unless I'm really trying to get
something specific off my face next I
had the L'Occitane dry skin hand cream
which is like the 20% shea butter one I
don't have any of these at the moment
but I really do like that hand cream
still I think it's a great one so that
is still definitely a favorite something
that I recommend highly I think it's
great I like to use my hand creams at
night before I go to bed and that one's
really nice I'm using the Crabtree and
Evelyn ones right now this one is
Nantucket briar and it's not my favorite
scent but I do like these hand creams
too so either one but I do think the
lots of time is worth the price and I
think you'll really enjoy it if you have
dry hands and the last like beauty
product that I mentioned in the video
was the Copacabana beach candle from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works now I totally forgot
about this candle I'm watching this
being like I don't remember what that
smells like that sounds delicious that
sounds great and in it I meant
I'm gonna get like five backups and
stuff oh my gosh seriously you should
have saw my face while I watched this
video I definitely didn't buy five
backups and I kind of wish I did now
because I wish I had it to smell and I
haven't seen back the body works come
out with it but at the same time I
totally forgot about that candle so I
guess it's not really a big deal that I
didn't pick more up and I saved my money
I really enjoyed the bath and Bodyworks
through what candles those are some of
my favorite ones for a pretty affordable
price they are like raising the prices
but I guess that's just how things are
anyway I love candles I'm not as
obsessed with them as I used to be I
tried to burn candles every now and then
and I enjoy the scent and the experience
and all of that but I used to be like
hardcore obsessed with just having
candles and I'm not like that I just
want like a couple for each season and
you know burn through them and enjoy
them and smell them and then I'm moving
on you know something that I mentioned
that wasn't a beauty product what was an
actual like item was a succulent atrium
I got this as a gift from Sam and his
mom she was visiting us from out of town
and they were at a store and I was at
work and they picked that up for me when
I got home I was so excited so that died
everything died in it it was beautiful
well lasted I really enjoyed it but yeah
definitely all died I think succulents
are really cute though I just it's
really hard to keep things alive right
now we have a really big basil plant
outside of our house and that's really
awesome and we're actually doing a
really good job and then we also have
some like lemon thyme and mint like in
our kitchen that we're trying to keep
alive so that we can like make smoothies
or make whatever we want with those so
yeah that one's dead but it was really
cute and then the last things that I
mentioned were just some like other
things kind of like how I do now where
it's like not beauty but things that I
was enjoying for the month and the first
thing I mentioned was Drake which is a
hundred percent Saul favorite drink is
like my all-time favorite greatest of
all time so good I love him so much I
love his music so much the album studies
come out since then that weren't even
out when I made that video love so good
I also mentioned Dexter as a favorite
and definitely not a favorite I enjoyed
the show I thought it was good I've
talked about this but I didn't enjoy the
ending I don't know it's not like my
favorite show of all time I wouldn't
like tell people like out of all the
shows you should watch Dexter
I would tell people to watch Game of
Thrones I would tell people to watch I
don't know just other things definitely
not Dexter it's not even in like my top
5 so that's not really a favorite
anymore and then the last two things one
of my favorites is moving to California
because at that point we have literally
been here a month um that's so crazy to
think about
that's definitely still a favorite I
love LA I love being here but I do want
to mention that my mindset has changed
so much from being here and there have
been a lot of dark times since being
here I've definitely dealt with more
depression than I ever have in my whole
life since being here I wouldn't even
say that I really had depression before
but that is like definitely a struggle
every day and I don't know if it's the
city and being away from family I don't
know if it is because just this time in
my life like I don't know what it is but
that is definitely something and I'm not
trying to like get into that too much I
might make a video about that I'm not
really sure it's just a daily struggle
type of thing and I'm not trying to like
bring this video down but um that's
definitely something and I don't want it
to seem like everything's just only
peachy and happy like that's not life
it's nuanced and things are different
every day is different so but I still
love LA I love being here when I go back
home I'm always like so excited to get
back to California and just the the pace
here the vibe here I enjoy there are
definitely some bad vibes but overall I
feel like the vibe is like we're just
operating at a level of like everyone's
trying to like you know make something
happen and I really like that cuz I'm
trying to make something happen to you
know and then the last favorite in there
I mentioned makeup school in this I had
just my first day of makeup school was
like the day before it's on this and
it's so weird to think about me before I
went to makeup school because it's been
such a defining thing for me being out
here you know the profession that I do
like I literally am just a freelance
makeup artist and now I do YouTube stuff
too so that's so awesome and to think
that when I had made that video I had
just started that journey you know and
I'm so glad I made the decision to go to
makeup school it's interesting to see
how excited I was
I think it's been two years since I
graduated makeup school now which is
crazy and yeah I'm really I'm really
happy about that still a favorite I'm
really glad I went
I had a good time and I definitely think
it's helped mold me into who I am and
how I think about makeup and what I do
with makeup and my artistry now so
that's everything thank you so much for
watching guys I can have this one was a
little bit rambley but there was just a
lot to talk about and it was just such a
blast from the past watching that video
super-duper weird anyway thank you so
much for watching guys and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
