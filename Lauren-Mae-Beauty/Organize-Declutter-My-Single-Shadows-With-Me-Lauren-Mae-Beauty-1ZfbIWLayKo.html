a great day we're sitting here in front
of all of my single shadows and it is
time for a single shattered declutter I
feel like in all my declutter videos
which I have a ton of all in the
playlist linked down below if you
haven't seen them I tend to always skip
over my single shadows because I I do
love them I use them quite often and I
find that I don't know I just I don't
want to get into it it's too much but
tonight we're getting into it we're
gonna sort these out if you follow me on
instagram you saw me post like me having
these all organized and as you can tell
they're not organized anymore because
when I pull for different videos and
whatnot when it comes to like let's
stupid videos and even for certain gigs
sometimes I will pull from these pallets
especially like when Halloween was
around and whatnot to create certain
looks so they just get like so crazy and
it just gets insane so I definitely have
to organize these quite often that being
said we're gonna organize these tonight
we're gonna get some of these gone I
always feel kind of weird getting rid of
some of my single shadows cuz I'm like
oh whoa I could use it potentially to
dupe a pallet but I do want this to be a
livable workable collection something
that I actually use and not just
hoarding and having to give you guys
dupes and swatches like I want to be
able to help you but I also want to love
that color regardless of if I was going
to tell you guys about it or not I mean
why would I want to keep something that
I didn't like just to tell you guys
about it why would I even want to tell
you about it so I will probably be
getting rid of quite a few Coastal
Scents shadows those are probably the
ones I'll be getting rid of the most
because I have the most of them and also
they're the oldest in here enough
talking I'm gonna speed this part up but
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
separate all of these shadows by brand I
was doing them by color and that does
help but I find that a lot of the times
I know what colors I'm looking for in
certain brands and I think for now at
least I am going to keep these shadows
organized by brand not by color we'll
see how long that lasts again I'm always
like switching things around but that's
what I think is gonna be the best - for
me at the moment so that is what I'm
going to do
so these are V piles all sorted out I
just looked like poker chips or
something but these are my makeup geek
these are my coastal sons I have my Mac
shadows my look-see shadows these are
color pop I have one Anastacio oh you
can't even see it my hand one Anastacio
these are it see shadows and then these
are a brand called stars makeup Haven
but they don't make shadows anymore I
was thinking about this and like
breaking it up into part oh but it's
just too much I'm not gonna do that I'm
not gonna break it into parts I'm not
gonna be swatching each and every single
one of these I want this is like real
life like I'm really actually declaring
my stuff I'm not just like doing it for
you I'm just filming what I'm actually
doing so anyway if you guys want to see
separate videos of just like me showing
you my shadows and swatching them after
I get them like too cluttered
let me know and I can try to work on
doing that for you guys but for this
video we're just we're trying to make
some decisions so hopefully we can do
that I'm gonna start off with kind of
the easiest ones for me but my
colour-pop ones because I love them and
you guys know that so I'm gonna lay them
out if I'm being honest from the
beginning here I have a feeling I'm
probably not gonna get rid of really
anything but I think it'll be
interesting to kind of put them out and
see what I have yeah I really do like
these um my ones my least favorite ones
honestly would be ready or yacht it's
just not my favorite it's not
necessarily bad and then salt water
again not anything bad just kind of not
my favorite but I am gonna keep them
because this is my probably favorite
formula at the moment if anything I have
something to compare them to for other
shadows that I get potentially from
colour-pop I'm gonna be using a big
palette I'm gonna clean this off and I'm
gonna stick them in and I'll show you
the finished result
okay so those are all my color pop
shadows really happy really excited I
honestly thought I had more kind of
funny to see them all lined out here I'm
excited to use them some of my favorites
though just saying high-strung glass
bowl I really like this one I believe
it's dragon no Snake Eyes dragonfly
those are newer ones but I love them
this is boardshorts ballet are sea stars
little boat yeah all of them I love them
all they're so good
highly suggest them especially can get
them on a deal this black is like
amazing so yeah this is a pretty hot
pink love that so good guys so good all
right one down I think next I'm gonna
move on to my look see ones these are
not my favorite formula I have a whole
review on looking shadows if you want to
check it out so you can kind of know my
thoughts people either love them or hate
them I feel like all the reviews I've
seen I know people that I love that like
them I know people that I love that
didn't like them and then I feel like
I'm kind of in the middle so I suggest
checking those reviews out to I'm gonna
leave them down below well they're not
only reviews I don't know just do some
research you know maybe only order a
couple and see how you like the formula
but I've heard from you guys that you
like them too so I'm really happy if you
do that's always awesome I'm gonna be
going through these first though and
seeing what I want to keep I know one
for sure I want to get rid of is the
color aura let me try to find it this is
aura and it looks really pretty in the
pan it has like a duo chrome to it but
it just I don't know it just isn't worth
it so I am actually going to be getting
rid of aura I'm putting all my stuff in
getting rid of at the moment in the C
palette we have one guys we got one the
mats are really nice they're just a
little bit dry I'm keeping dirty for
sure I'm also keeping oh no this is a
color pop shadow how does that happen
I'm also going to be keeping the color
sorbet that one's really nice as well
this is the color cutie pie and this
actually shows up
lid pretty well so I'm gonna keep that
this is a really interesting color it's
called Buttercup and it's just like a
yellow but it's kind of a pastel yellow
I think I'm gonna keep that as well I'm
telling you I feel like a lot of my
stuff is gonna be Coastal Scents that I
get rid of this is the color truffle
it's all broken and that is one of the
issues I had I don't know where I'm in
focus but a lot of the stuff came well
that shadow just constantly kept
breaking and I've also had other ones
break this is maple and I love maple I
also love the color terracotta I love
the color Pharaoh this is Omega and it's
really really pretty but it's very very
powdery I don't have anything quite like
it in my collection so I think I am
going to keep it I mean it's stunning I
just I don't love the formula it reminds
me of the color in the prism palette is
it it's not trophy thrown I think it's
thrown I also really love honeyBun I
also really love pumpkin spice life I
have three of these colors and they're
all kind of similar this one is madly
deeply this one is I like that one this
is lovestruck I'm gonna keep lovestruck
this is first kiss there's gonna be a
tragedy guys I know something is gonna
um I think I'm gonna get rid of madly
deeply only because it's very very
similar I don't know I don't need it
topless Lea devoted is a really nice
taupe and I don't normally gravitate to
those color someone to keep that and now
I think we're stuck with all of the
shimmers I feel like this is where I'm
gonna have to make some potential
decisions this is the color obsessed
it's really pretty this is the color
bohemian which is very similar you guys
can tell um I like obsessed because it's
a little bit lighter but I feel like I
would probably gravitate to my makeup
geek shadow so I'm gonna get rid of
obsessed and I'm gonna keep bohemian I
love the color lime light so I'm gonna
keep that this is the color star boy I
really like this so pretty I'm gonna
keep
that color this is flower child and it
is like a pink with a green shift to it
it's pretty it doesn't look that amazing
I feel like here but I'm gonna keep that
one for now this is Genesis and it's
kind of like make a makeup geek shadow
that I have so that's it they're the
makeup geek shadow is called
kaleidoscope and I just like
kaleidoscope better so I'm gonna get rid
of Genesis wow I'm doing a really good
job guys
I already said I'm keeping Omega this is
a really beautiful color it's Aquarius I
really like it this is slither love that
keeping that I have the color noir which
I also think is so pretty yeah I'm gonna
keep noir this is foxy lady it's like a
purple or yeah purple with a gold reflex
to it really interesting
this is duper star which is a similar
color to Urban Decay's tonic but since I
have tonic and makeup geeks black light
I think I'm actually gonna pass on that
I just don't need it and I already know
that it's a dupe I don't I just don't
need it
there's no way I can go through three of
those shadows in my lifetime even though
I love it that much this is Purple Haze
very chunky really beautiful though so
I'm gonna keep those let me organize
them in my palette and I'll show you the
finished palette so those are all of my
look-see shadows that I'm keeping and
these are the ones that I'm getting rid
of I have three of them or what the heck
three oh I can't account there are five
of them so far so five shadows down guys
okay let's move on to Mac so I think I'm
going to just try to organize them
really fast
first here this is max vanilla I do like
that I'm gonna keep it
Mac's ho I like that color I also love
what is a soft brown I also love kid so
I'm gonna keep all three of those I know
that for sure
I love matte shades if you can't tell I
feel like those are so good
this is Max shrim and then I have also
rice paper I'm gonna get rid of rice
paper I don't like this color
I don't think it's anything special it
has hard pan just like I am gonna keep
shroom though I think that one's kind of
nice
this is max quark I'm gonna keep that
one that one's really nice I also really
love wood winked definitely keeping that
keeping antiqued one of my favorites
this is the color twinks and whoo I've
thrown it around this one's actually
pretty nice I like that they're
buildable I know some people like swatch
these and don't think they're very
pigmented right off and sometimes
they're not but that is kind of the
benefit of a Mac shadow to me I also
have Mac's
sable oh my gosh mmm and this is really
pretty as well really like that
it's kind of similar to twinks though
I'm gonna get rid of twinks and I'm just
gonna keep max sable stars and rockets
love this color so so pretty I'm keeping
that one I'm also keeping sushi flour
I just put brown in it to put it it's
really pretty I also have a pretty big
dip in that I was using it in my brows
for a while this is max rule I'm gonna
keep that one and then last year is
mythology and this reminds me of like a
looksie shadow honestly oh wow that's
watched really nice
I don't know now let me check my color
pop shadows see if I have anything
similar because that's watched really
good
I have saltwater no this is high-strung
no boardshorts
no I don't know I kind of like it I
think I'm gonna keep it while I wasn't
expecting to I thought I was for sure
gonna get rid of that one but uh it's
working guys these are all my max
shadows that I'm keeping and I got rid
of one oh no I got rid of two oh cool
I got rid of two so I've three pallets
or brands done so far I have some just
like tiny ones here so I guess we could
just get through these obviously I'm
keeping my honest Asya orange soda but
I'm probably gonna put that with my
makeup geek stuff I have some shadows
here from the brand it seemed I was sent
these actually from autumn a while ago
and I've really been enjoying using
these for my let's see Jupiter YZ just
kind of like another brand and I think
overall the shadow quality is pretty
nice this purple is questionable we'll
see I'll put that to the side at the
moment I really like this Brown and
chocolate that's nice
this is a pretty blue yeah the blue so
nice and then this blue or green really
uh my hands still what so I don't know I
think I'm gonna keep this green because
it's something a little bit different
this purple though I have a lot of other
Purple's I feel like from Coastal Scents
so I think I'm gonna pass on the purple
for these and probably I'm just gonna
put them in this little palette I think
it'll just be easiest
those are my it see shadows and then
these right here are actually from a
brand called stars makeup Haven I'm
probably gonna keep all of these this is
the color squeak I was using it as a
face highlight for a while to hit pan
this is a really pretty color as well I
mean the pigmentation is really nice
there a little powdery this color have
nothing like it and it's beautiful and I
love it and then this orange is stunning
as well so I'm gonna keep those and I'm
also going to put them in this palette
so those are gonna be my Etsy and stars
makeup Haven shadows alright guys we're
getting down we only have two more
brands to go we're gonna do makeup geek
obviously cuz it's gonna be easier than
Coastal Scents I'm gonna put them in my
big Z palette this is like the
extra-large one I'm just gonna clean it
out to for my makeup geek I doubt I'm
gonna get rid of anything but I'm gonna
just sort them by like mattes and
spoiled and duo Chrome's and whatnot so
I can get an idea of what I have going
on yeah I'm keeping them all so it's
really just about putting them in in
here I'm gonna do like my mattes and
neutrals and then do my duo crumbs at
the bottom so I will just let you guys
watch me do this
Wow a perfect fit guys how amazing is
that so do their only makeup geek
shadows I absolutely love them you can
tell some of these are my favorite even
though this is a Nastasia is orange Soto
some of my favorites out of this palette
just to let you guys know I love creme
brulee I love this is coca-cola or
cherry cola I'm sorry
grandstands beautiful starry i'ts so
pretty whimsical love these ones here
are all from the or these two these two
and this one are from the pressed
pigment duo Chrome's that they came out
with they don't have those for sale but
they did for like a brief time at Fame
Expo and I got my hands on them so
that's awesome
I love masquerades so much I think
Pegasus is beautiful for that look I
mean it's definitely you know a shadow I
look chickadee I love cupcake I mean I
just love so many of them the one shadow
that's not my favorite is this one here
in Neptune I don't have anything quite
like it so I'm keeping it I just think
it could be potentially better it's just
not like the best but for a matte cobalt
blue it's still really good also Caitlin
Rose is a little unpigmented but it's
still good it's just not quite the same
intensity as the other foils but I still
love these all regardless glad they all
fit in here perfectly oh my gosh that
makes me so happy I'm gonna move on to
you Coastal Scents now I'm gonna sort
them all I think my color family I think
that'll be easiest and then we'll go
through color by color getting rid of
stuff
okay so I have it split up into color
families kind of it's not like the best
thing ever I think we're gonna start off
with little purples and Pink's just
because I think they're fun and we'll go
from there so lots of purples
they all are just like slightly
different right like there's something
different about them so these two off
the bat one is Meo four and one is the
color my time I'm gonna swatch them and
see how similar they are one is
definitely brighter they're not the same
but they're very similar I'm gonna get
rid of this one here the lighter one Meo
for I'm also getting rid of this you
know like what's helping me also get rid
of it is because it doesn't have a name
on it and I know that means that it's
pretty old because they do have names
for their shadows now so I'm gonna pass
it on that doesn't mean I'm gonna get
rid of everything that doesn't have a
name but since I was trying to make a
decision I let that be my guide so I'm
gonna keep my time this is what I really
like this is antique why lack and it's
really pretty I use it for my brows on
my hair is purple this is the color s 19
so you know it's old but it is quite
pretty it's a little powdery but it's
it's nice so we'll see
I really like this one I'm keeping this
this is me0 5 this is lace lavender that
one is and that's okay this one is s20 I
feel like s 20 is better than lace
lavender so I'm gonna get rid of lace
lavender keep s 20 so we filled up one
we're getting rid of nine that's pretty
good for me and now we have 10 this one
is deep grape I don't have anything
quite like this in my other colors so
although I don't think it's like the
best I'm gonna keep it this is the color
Icelandic that one's really pretty and
then this is the color and 11 you think
they're not gonna be different but
they're definitely different I'm gonna
keep both of those this is s 21 that's
pretty good I'm
test these two next to each other yeah
they're different enough for me
I'll take it and then this one here is
I'm 15 I mean two for blending things
out I feel like it'd be nice so I'm
gonna keep those and then this one do I
want to keep it yeah I don't have
anything kind of like that color so I'm
gonna keep this - all right so I've
eliminated one purple or two Purple's
let's move on to Pink's because there's
kind of a lot at least that I put in the
pink section some of them are more
Coralie than straight-up pink there are
a few that I know for sure I'm keeping
like I know I'm keeping this as ml8 I
love that color so much it's beautiful
I'm also keeping petal peach that is
such a beautiful shade I am going to
keep bronze peach I also love that one
bittersweet orange I'm gonna swatch
bittersweet orange and oh yeah they're
different I mean they're different but I
feel like next to each other or you
wouldn't tell I'm gonna get rid of
bittersweet orange not about shadow I
just don't need it in comparison to
everything it's like crazy
this is Emmy twelve I'm gonna keep that
one it has a really pretty shift to it
too that one's super pretty like an icy
pink this is like a baby matte pink I'm
gonna keep both of those I also like
pale nude it's like a nice matte this is
the color reef coral it's so powdery I'm
gonna get rid of that I don't like that
color this is peach fuzz and this one's
so nice and so beautiful I used to wear
this like every single day on my lid I
loved it so much definitely gonna keep
that one mine like fell and broke that's
why it's like crazy-looking but I do
highly suggest that this one's so pretty
- this is bo1 used to use this a lot in
my brows - it's like a cool-toned pinky
purple this is reef pink I don't know I
just don't really like that one either
so I'm gonna get rid of that those are
just really powdery and
if you like they aren't anything special
they don't have like a high shine but
they're not matte like I just don't need
them in my life really like fine wine
I'm gonna keep that one I also like this
one bo2 gonna keep that this is Emmy 20
really pretty I'm gonna keep that one
too I like this one
m25 just nice and dark
this is wild reason this I've used
definitely in different you know swatch
videos and stuff so I'm going to keep
that the sun dried that one's really
pretty this is the color raisin berry
really love that I mean the quality of
this one is amazing
sun-dried was really nice too and then
this is the color red stone which I've
also talked about a ton so I'm actually
going to keep all of those ones I think
they're all very beautiful alright we're
moving onto another palette and then
we're gonna move on to blues and greens
I don't use blues and greens a lot but I
think they're great for you know
specialized looks and whatnot but I
don't need this many I also have stuff
in different palettes I don't know I'd
rather have different stuff too so I
really want to take a good look I know
I'm keeping the lakeside if you guys
don't know I do have a whole video on my
top 15 Coastal Scents shadows check that
video out I'm also gonna keep the color
indigo I mean this is just as good of
quality as something that makeup geek
would come out with this is Capri blue
this one is absolutely stunning as well
I'm gonna keep that I really like this
shadow s11 wooo like that I'm keepin
Python green because it's just so cool
and it's matte I do like this shade a
lot cornflower blue
keeping that this is beautiful blue
Hawaii so beautiful love that quality
can't beat it
this is golden avocado and it's a very
interesting shade SuperDuper beautiful
keeping that pinehearst I've used this
for a bit in videos to dupe stuff and it
is nice I'm gonna keep it I am gonna
keep this shade balsam love
this is frosted pea it's just so powder
eight no I'm getting her in a frosted
pea this is something different for what
I have here olive wood that's pretty
nice this is dark golden olive that ones
I mean beautiful this is
gipsy green no i already I'm like so
powdery no no no no well I've gotten rid
of some guys whew okay this is Molly
what is this Molly blue it's pretty I'm
not like in love I'm gonna get rid of
that one
this is gypsy blue also I just feel like
lakeside is like a better version of
that so I'm gonna get rid of that one I
have soft clover I kind of like that
it's I'm on the fence I also have the
color olive which is like more yellow
then blue based I just feel like those
are so similar I'm gonna get rid of soft
clover I don't need it this is mo - that
one's really nice this is hoppin
jalapeno I kind of like that one too but
it is similar to olive I'm gonna keep
both ones like better for like lighter
skin or darker skin this is sea spray
which is matte then I have that one
which is not this is a mint condition
then I have this one which is m12 and
then I have this one which is C Lilly
see Lilly is way better than m12 I'm
gonna get rid of that and then out of
these I really like a sea spray because
it's matte but this one mint condition
it has a shine to it but I think I have
a better shine and a different one so
I'm gonna get rid of those all right I'm
gonna put these in my palette and we'll
see what the greens and blues
those are all the greens and blues that
I am keeping and so far we're at 9 18 20
shadows that I am getting rid of I'm
very proud of that I'm gonna try to fit
all of my neutrals in here I don't know
if that'll be possible because I do like
a lot of these but I'm gonna try to be
pretty harsh we'll see first off I love
this one so I'm going to be keeping it
this is the color mm e23 it's like
something copper Oh guys it's beautiful
I'm also keeping pumpkin pie it's an
amazing mat for my transition love it
I'm keeping Oktoberfest because I love
it this is chinois nude I love that
shade this one's also really pretty it's
Meo 3 I mean you guys it's beautiful
keeping that this is dark goldenrod and
it's really pretty
has something kind of like green to it
I'm gonna keep it on the side for now
this one's really pretty - Emmy 22 I'm
actually gonna get rid of this one I
think cuz it's really similar to like
that's so pretty maybe I want I don't
know these two are like I don't knows
let's do all of these Browns I got a lot
of grounds that are matte all of these
look very much the same and I also feel
like I don't normally gravitate to these
to pull from so I'm gonna swatch them
and we'll see they're all the same color
okay this one's definitely different
harvest Brown and then out of those I
don't know I kind of like midnight rodeo
so I think I'm gonna get rid of these
two and then this one is that when it's
a little cooler so I'm gonna keep those
and then this is new terrain which is at
the bottom I also feel like it's a
little it's a little bit different I'm
gonna keep it to the maybe pile this is
timeless taupe I'm going to keep that
one it's a nice taupe color I have a
grey here in brown stone another kind of
like Toby but more grey
this is really really beautiful formula
wise it's very beautiful and it is
platinum blue I might put that in the
blues for these like lighter colors that
all look like white let's see
this is Meo 7 it's like a white metallic
that's something a little different I
have polar bear which is like I'm Matt
oh no it's not Matt it's like kind of
has a sheen to it and then this one is
candle light which also has a sheen to
it but it's kind of gray I think I'm
gonna get rid of candle light I feel
like I'd rather reach for these two even
though I feel it gets a little more
pigmented than polar bear I just feel
like I'd rather go for this color than
that one this is sand dune
oh yeah that's like a more taupe I'm
gonna keep that something a little
different I'm also keeping this one in
Bombay it's like a grey matte color this
