to my channel you may notice that the
tree behind me the big white one is not
filled with ornaments and that is
because I'm going to be doing an
ornament collection video I'm really
excited I know this isn't gonna be for
everyone so it's not beauty related but
I love ornaments at our wedding Sam and
I made our wedding gift ornaments to
everyone that we're all blush-colored
and they could pick and choose from this
really cute display my grandpa made and
then every Christmas when they put their
ornament on the tree they can remember
you know the good time we had at our
wedding and everything so ornaments and
Christmas are really important to me at
me and Sam also get ornaments everywhere
we go on all the different trips we go
on just so that at Christmas we can
remember those times in those memories
as we put our ornaments on the tree so
I'm going to go through all the
ornaments that I have on my big tree let
me know down below if you like this
video and you want me to do a specific
one on my Barbie ornaments I have been
getting Barb measurements for a long
time I don't have the biggest collection
but that's what this little purple tree
is it's my Barbie tree if you liked this
one let me know and you want to see that
one put it in the comments because this
video is already gonna be SuperDuper
long so grab a drink grab a snack
and if you're ready to see my collection
of ornaments with tiny stories really
short because we're gonna go fast then
just keep watching well we might as well
start off with my wedding ornament first
this is one of the ones from my wedding
it was just a really pretty colored
ornament and then I made little tags
like this it said salmon Lauren and our
wedding date on them I love this
ornament obviously super pretty and it
reminds me of my wedding every time we
see it I'm doing all of my sentimental
ones slash ones that I got from trips
and stuff first then I'll move on so
yeah these are two ornaments Sam and I
got in Tucson at a bookstore they're
really thin like metal ornaments that
were hand drawn on or painted we just
got these while we happen to be down
there so yeah these are from a Tucson
book store this one is one of my
favorite ornaments I've ever received it
was from Sam from 2010 he got me this so
we were just dating when we
dating what a couple of years at that
point but it was actually for Macy's and
it was just an extra added on part of a
gift that they were giving up ornaments
and then the woman just wrote on it my
name and Merry Christmas and the date
and it's so funny because it's one of my
favorite gifts I've ever been given I
just love this so much
reminds me of when we were even younger
this is what five years ago now and
we've been together eight years so yeah
I love this ornament and I love that it
has a date on it and that it still means
so much to me in September of last year
me and Sam took a road trip and we went
to Louisiana that was our main goal to
see our friend Kate in New Orleans and
then on the way there we stopped by all
these other places so I'm gonna show you
all the ornaments we got on that trip
this first one is from oak alley it's
the oak alley plantation so I bought it
when we went to go see that plantation I
love this ornament it's so pretty it's
hand-painted and that's the plantation
itself this is an ornament that we got
when we went to Carlsbad Caverns it has
like bats on it it's just like kind of a
classic ornament nothing too special but
again nice to remember that memory we
also went to the Alamo on that trip so
this is a ornament of the Alamo when we
went there this is the ornament we got
when we were actually in New Orleans
this is like that Mardi Gras mask type
of gesture thing was really reminiscent
of our time there and I really like the
colors of it definitely New Orleans and
I think the last one from that trip that
we got this is from our little alien and
the Santa hat cuz we went to Roswell New
Mexico and did like a couple things in
that town just happened on the way back
to Arizona so this one is probably one
of our favorite ornaments I just think
it's hilarious and kind of cute and just
weird so yeah I think I'm going to group
it by another trip so the next trip I'll
show you is when we went to Paris this
is the time we got engaged this is my
Neil and Paris ornament because we had
to go to Disneyland Paris if we're gonna
go and yeah I really like that one
although this was very expensive and
it's already broken off a lot of pieces
so
oh my gosh I just broke an ornament it's
okay because I kind of didn't like that
one actually if you decide to do an
Ironman video be really careful cuz your
ornaments can break on you
luckily actually was an ornament that
I'm not too sad about it breaking I'm so
happy because I would have probably
cried had it been something different it
was an ornament I got from Las Vegas
when we went for her friend's birthday
we're not friends with anymore so kind
of worked out right anyway moving on
more Paris ornaments this is just a
little tin one that we got it has like
the Eiffel Tower and stuff and then it
can open up if you want it to so kind of
it was just okay I mean this one I
didn't really need this is an ornament I
got when we were at Notre Dom so it has
it on the back really like this one and
this is one we got from when we went to
Versailles that's where Sam proposed to
me was at the Versailles Palace and we
were by like anyway we went did we were
in Versailles and this is Marie
Antoinette and we were kind of by her
little like little place her little
castle on the property anyway yeah so we
got both of those I think those are all
the Paris lines I think those are all my
Paris ornaments I love all of those ones
this is an ornament me and Sam got in
Cancun when we went in 2013 just really
pretty
looks like Mexico so I really like this
one for our honeymoon me and Sam went to
Portland we did a road trip up to
Portland so we got a couple different
ornaments on the way there this is one
that we got we went to the Japanese like
garden I don't know yeah just like a
Japanese garden up there in Portland and
this is a maple leaf that's dipped in
copper so I really like that one this is
one we also got in Portland this is a
lumberjack so we thought it was
appropriate on our way up to Oregon we
stopped in weed California and ate some
pie so we excited to get a weed
California ornament it's just like a
wooden one we also went to the rose
gardens in Portland and this is a little
too ornament that has a
on it that we got while we were there
and inside it says Portland rose garden
inside the cup in the last ornament we
got in Oregon was the Oregon sasquatch
it's just like a Bigfoot ornament we
were driving through the woods a lot of
the time and so this one was really
appropriate because it got really creepy
at night when we were driving and it was
just like so dense woods no like people
in sight and our radio wouldn't even
work a little scary so we thought this
one would be a good one to get this is a
more recent ornament me and Sam got when
we went to the San Diego Zoo and it's
like a little ape guy and then we also
got it engraved with the date we like to
put the dates on our ornament so that
way we can remember the time that we got
them because it's hard things get so
muddled after years and years and I can
only imagine 20 years down the line
there's no way I'd remember like which
year we went somewhere or what month we
went somewhere this is more of a
sentimental ornament this is an ornament
that Sam's niece made me or my niece now
to cadence and it's just really pretty
it's purple and green with glitter
inside I love this ornament I think it's
so pretty especially with the lights on
you can kind of see through it I love it
another kind of more sentimental one
this is one that my aunt made me it's a
crocheted ornament and it's like a
graduation one for when I graduated from
ASU I love this ornament I don't think
she knew I'd love it as much as I do
she actually has an Etsy shop where she
makes different crocheted things so I'll
leave her link down below
she doesn't oh I'm gonna do that but if
you guys want anything crocheted how are
your inter crochet stuff you can check
her site out but I really like this and
I just think it's great it's a little
owl so cute
speaking of graduation we have our
little ASU ornament this is because me
and Sam both graduated from ASU we
weren't in the bookstore I was like
let's get that you know it's a little
reminder of our time here at ASU so
favorite ASU ornament the next couple of
ornaments I'm going to show you are all
from a trip that we made on our 5th year
anniversary to San Francisco it's
probably one of my favorite trips we've
ever done because it was one of the
first times we started dating when we
were really young so it was one of the
first times I met freedom and you know
went out on our own paid for our own
trip and just really got to be adults
you know
and it was really just a fun time so
these are all ornaments from nut this is
one of mine and Sam's favorite ornaments
we've ever gotten this is from Chinatown
it's like a koi fish I love this one it
also like moves like that it's just so
pretty I love this one this is an
ornament of the Hearst Castle
I love the Hearst Castle and so when we
were up there we stopped in San Simeon
to go to the Hearst Castle though I had
already been before and this is just a
shot of the big pool this is the Neptune
pool there are two different pools one's
inside if you ever have the chance to go
to Hearst Castle go it's so beautiful I
love it this is an ornament of the
Golden Gate Bridge because we were in
San Francisco we got this little guy as
an ornament from Chinatown as well
although it is in an ornament it's like
a sucker thing to a window we just hang
it on the tree and that's something to
like if you're going around and they
don't have like a specific Christmas
ornament you can make keychains and
different things into Christmas
ornaments so keep that in mind the whole
ornament tip the last ornament from our
trip was this one this is our ed hardy
ornament is what we call it it looks
very ed hardy to me which is a little
scary but this is from Alcatraz when we
went to Alcatraz as a memory from that
one our most recent bigger trip was when
we went to Peru so some of you guys may
have seen these hauled in my Peru haul
but I did get a llama ornament this is
actually a keychain and again I just
made it an ornament this is another one
we got it has like the two people on the
front I really like this one it's really
festive
and this is another item that I turned
into an ornament it's like a fuzzy hat
and I got this for free with a purchase
so I thought it would be cute to hang on
the train and those are the ones I got
from Peru I didn't get too many but I
mean it's one trip I got three ornaments
this is something I just got probably a
couple days ago we went to Sylvain
California which is like a I think it's
a Dutch or Danish I don't know which one
I'm so sorry but um little town and they
have a ton of Christmas shops and
everything was decorated for Christmas
so cute and this is just some little
wooden shoes I say solving on the side
of them another trip we did more
recently we went to Santa Barbara for
our eighth year anniversary
so we just picked up a little starfish
ornament to remember that time so now
I'm going to move on to him all my candy
ornaments I have a dream of having a lot
of Christmas trees so I want to have a
real Christmas tree for all of our like
sentimental ornaments and then my weight
Christmas tree will eventually just be a
candy tree just full of candy ornaments
and then like I mentioned before the
purple trees my Barbie ornament trees so
I'm going to show you all the candy
ornaments I have collected over the last
couple of years I've been wanting to
have my candy tree for a couple years
now so it's not a ton of ornaments it's
not enough definitely to cover a whole
tree but I am slowly and surely
collecting these ornaments so I will
show you all my cute candy ones these
don't necessarily have any like
sentimental value I try to just get
different candy ornaments so it can look
very don the tree and more unique so I
don't want to like have a bunch of like
donut ornaments I want to keep it buried
this is a more recent one that I got
it's like a peppermint taffy candy type
of ornament it's just plastic I got this
in solving they had really cheap
ornaments this was only like two dollars
or something I thought this was a really
cute one something different I hadn't
seen before
this is another one I got insolvent it's
a chocolate bar ornament and I hadn't
seen anything like this so I got this
one and it's really cute it looks really
nice on the tree this is a little
gumdrop ornament love this one I think
it was from Target last year this is
probably one of my favorite ones this is
a cotton candy ornament I think I got it
Hobby Lobby last year I loved it it
looks so cool on the tree haven't seen
anything quite like this one
really glad I picked this one up this
was the last ornament I got in solving
it's just like a gingerbread cookie but
I really liked the colors of it it's
like more muted and pink and girly so
this is just cute it's a snowflake I got
this gingerbread ornament just at
Walgreens this year for two dollars I
thought they made a nice addition to the
Christmas tree candy tree because I
hadn't had any gingerbread at that point
and it's just like a classic little guy
this is a like Fudgsicle type of
ornament it's very heavy that's the one
thing I don't like about it it you have
to put it really high on the tree where
the branches are the most stiff because
it's so heavy but it's really pretty
really glittery this is an ornament I
got this year at Macy's it's a matte
and it's in like a mint color they had a
ton of other ones too like a white and a
pink and whatnot so if you're interested
in this one I would definitely go to
Macy's and check it out I can't remember
where I got this ornament but I did get
this one last year it's so cute it's
really light cuz it's made out of like
foam and I really like this one I think
it might have been Hobby Lobby I was
like obsessed with Hobby Lobby last year
this is a little cupcake ornament that
my mom got me this year because she
knows I have my you know candy tree so
she picked this up for me and yeah it's
just a cute little blue cupcake this is
another one I got this year this is from
Target it's so cute it's a pink donut to
sprinkle donut I love it
I didn't have any donuts till this year
so I've really liked it this is a huge
cake pop it's so big the stick is like
really long but it's really nice I got
this at Hobby Lobby last year and it's
quite heavy but um it kind of off puts
it with the big stick so yeah this one
is definitely different this one was a
little different for my candy tree
instead of it being like overtly candy
it's like this cocoa cafe and it's
inside a hot chocolate mug I just have
something different to put on the candy
tree instead of just like an actual
piece of candy I thought this one was
just something different and kind of fun
this is another one my mom picked up I
don't know where she got this probably
like the thrift store I don't even know
but it's like an actual piece of candy
wrapped up and yeah I think it's kind of
nice a little bit more traditional touch
to my candy tree there's one more
cupcake this one I got at Walgreens I
think they were there this year too so
definitely check it out really a cute
one I just liked the way it looked I
liked the color combination and
everything and the last candy ornament
this one is a gumball machine I got this
at Macy's this year I love this one I
haven't seen anything quite like it I
like that the balls like actually move
around inside and I think it's just so
cute again something a little different
for a candy tree but totally makes sense
and I love it now on to my last little
bit of ornaments some of these are
random some of these are like
sentimental but not like from a trip or
something so they're the last bit we're
on the last leg of this ornament
collection I have a few ornaments from
my time at justice I were
for justice for five years so I wish I
had started getting ornaments from the
beginning like when I first started
working there but I didn't so I have
just a few this one is one from 2011 so
it's just one of the little justice
ornaments with the like frogs on it this
is from 2013 and this is one of their
light-up initial ones the batteries
aren't working it anymore so I need to
switch them out but this one is from
2013 from justice and this was my last
like Christmas working there this was
from 2014 and the lights work on this
one but it's really cute on the tree
again it's another initial ornament this
is an ornament my dad actually made he
made this when he was young in 1973 so I
like to have it on my tree just to
continue having it and again for my
children I think it'll be really cute I
also really like the colors on it I
think you did a great job great job dad
this is a little pickle ornament you can
get these at world market but there's a
tradition that you hide the pickle in
the tree and then I believe whoever
finds it gets luck for the next year so
we take turns hiding the pickle on the
tree so this is a little Alaska ornament
that my grandma got me and I believe she
got it when she went to Alaska I got
this when I was really really young but
it has like a little Eskimo with a
penguin this is just an ornament I got
at Target a couple years ago it's just
cute nothing nothing more than cute this
is an ornament I got Sam last year this
is because we're moving out here to
California for him to act I thought it
would be his first Oscar right his first
Oscar everyone this is probably the
freakiest ornament that I own this is um
a pinata I got this at Target last year
but I got this because one year for
Valentine's Day
he got me a pinata that looked like this
from Food City and hung it on her air
vent and filled it with things that he
thought I'd like and then we had like a
pinata bashing party a little bit later
with friends but I just thought like oh
my gosh there's like an actual ornament
to represent that time how insane so I
definitely had to buy it I bought this
one last year from Hobby Lobby because
it's a ring and we got married last year
we just had our one-year anniversary and
I just liked it I thought it'd be so
pretty on the tree
I really only have a few more left so
we'll keep going guys thank you for
sticking with me at this point this is
an ornament that I got a long time ago
when I was really young when we went on
a trip to Colorado with my family I just
really liked it and I still have it all
these years so I hang it on my adult
Christmas tree now this is an ornament I
got at Walgreens I think last year I
just liked it it has like little balls
at the bottom of the Snowman and I just
think it's cute it was like a dollar and
I liked it
this is I take it back this is the
creepiest ornament we own this is a
clown or a man I got at the thrift store
and I just thought it was hilarious that
this is even a real thing so I bought it
and now we hang it on her tree
so yeah this is such a whimsical
fanciful ornament I love it it is a
narwhal from Target last year I think
it's so pretty and sparkly on the tree
this tassel ornament was actually a gift
from one of my mom's clients she gave it
to us with a like our wedding gift and
it was just kind of attached as
decoration I think but I thought it was
so beautiful I don't have anything just
like a tassel ornament and I really
liked it and she has since passed away
so it was so sweet of her to think of us
on our wedding and she really hadn't met
me or Sam she just knows about us
because my mom does hair and talks to
her clients about her children and her
life and stuff so I like having this on
there it's just a memory of her and also
I just a memory of like just kindness
and people and you know the holiday
spirit I really love this Jack's opposed
with that I have Ursula to see which I
just got this because it was from what's
that place the Disney Store I bought
this up the Disney Store quite a few
years ago I just liked it it's kind of
heavy but I really like this one
this is one Sam got me it's just an L
it's nothing that special you got at
Target and you just got a bunch of
things we were doing the 12 days of
Christmas last year so we every day of
the 12 days you get someone like 12 of
something 11 of something 13 why am I
going the other way 11 is something 10
of something until the the day of
Christmas so yeah this is just one of
so I hang on the tree these are my last
two ornaments this is another one from
Target it's just a stocking and usually
me and Sam fill it with candy canes we
haven't this year we haven't bought any
so maybe I'll do that today and fill it
for him
and the last ornament is the largest
ornament I got this at the thrift store
and I thought it was just so 70s and so
cool I love the color and the way it
looked and I just loved it so that is
this big ball ball ornament is that
enough ornaments I think so
