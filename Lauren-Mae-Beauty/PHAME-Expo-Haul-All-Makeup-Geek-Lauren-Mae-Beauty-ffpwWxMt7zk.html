it's Lauren I wasn't expecting to film
today but I just got back from fame Expo
and I thought I'm gonna just fill in the
hall I I wasn't going to go to fame Expo
and then I saw the duochrome press no
wait what are they called their the foil
do chrome press shadows from makeup geek
and they were like debuting at fan expo
and so Heather from love Heather right
here on YouTube attacked me in that
picture and when I saw that I was like
I'm gonna hit up my contacts at my old
school see if we're there so I got in
for free and my number one goal was to
get those eyeshadows I told myself I'd
only get to Enoch got a lot more than
that but I kept it to just makeup geek I
didn't get sucked in by the other brands
or booths and I'm really proud of myself
I actually wasn't really wanting to buy
anything from anyone else I don't know I
just I guess I just had my heart set on
these and I also got a couple other
makeup geek shadows as well because they
were doing a sale so all their regular
eye shadows were five dollars apiece and
all of the foiled and then the foil duo
Chrome's were eight dollars instead of
10 I just thought that was a really good
deal i can pass it up plus it in charge
me tax either so I feel like I spent a
lot but I wanted these anyway and that
was part of the thing like I was only
gonna get two shadows but then i was
thinking like I'm gonna buy these later
I might as well get them on a good deal
I know that's bad logic a little bit but
I'm really happy with my purchases and I
love the makeup geek shadows that I
bought earlier like a month or so ago
I'm happy about it I did already take
them all to the package even though I
just got home just to show you though
this is what all their like duochrome
and I think they're do comb foiled and
they're foiled shadows came in packaging
like this really cute with the rose gold
and then all their regular shadows come
in this type of packaging kind of like
the mac but just a different design on
the outside something cute to this did
come in the bag with it just a cute
little makeup geek sticker and then
these are the shadows they don't look
that exciting in the Z palette which I
did by the Z palette as well at fan expo
I got the double-sided 1 i'd already
have a double-sided palette that is from
etsy that someone like made for me and i
really do like it but it doesn't have a
really really strong magnet and so I
feel like in my case if I want something
like I know these are
move around where's that one it's just
not as strong and if things are jostling
and my kit I just feel like I just feel
a little scared for them so I wanted
something nice and sturdy and this is
also on a sale this is only only it was
36 instead of 45 I'm not sure if I could
have got a better deal but I still felt
that was pretty good anyway so those are
the shadows I got I'm gonna start off
with the duochrome foiled because they
are the most exciting and I got every
single one of them but one I didn't get
one because it looked like one for my
Kat Von D palette I don't know when
these are going to be released the girl
at the booth said that they don't have a
date on them at all they potentially
might not go out which I doubt entirely
because these are really pretty I'm sure
that's just kind of a part of the sales
tactic to get you to buy them there but
I did ask while I was there about the
loose duochrome shadows and those are
going to be coming back they're just
working on repackaging them because the
packaging not only were their issues
with the sifter but I guess some of the
Rings like when you would screw it we're
breaking so they're just working on
getting better packaging but those will
come back so I found that out which is
awesome I'm not gonna do up close
swatches so if you really want like up
close crazy swatches let me know this
first one here is called wildfire this
is a really I'm gonna try out to save
really pretty a million times because i
know i do that but a really pretty
peachy golden color if you've seen my
sweet peach Duke video I feel like if
you have a bunch of colors like this
isn't necessary this was when I was
going back and forth on and I just
decided to get it but it's super
metallic I mean it's really pretty but
I'm just saying I just I couldn't leave
it there this one is the color
kaleidoscope and again I feel like in
the pan it doesn't do them quite the
justice that one's kaleidoscope and you
can't see it there but it has a shift of
green to purple to pink it's quite
beautiful the next one's mood ring this
is the one I suggest out of all of them
I don't know if I was gonna stick to
getting to this is going to be one of
the ones I was going to get mood ring
and kaleidoscope world are little
similar mood rings just a little more
purple pink instead of blue purple pink
and just let you guys know the texture
on these is definitely very much like
the foiled it's like a heavier creamy
type of consistency and they do have
that foiled look I'm very very
with them I think that the duochrome
really does show up really nicely the
next color is prism this is like a
lighter color and it has a golden pink
base these are really bad swatches so
again if you want like a in-depth swatch
video I can do that for you and the last
duochrome foil that I got was sugar rush
and I believe these are names of their
loose pigments if i'm not mistaken and
then this one sugar crush this is like a
cooler toned light white color and it
has that like purple pink blue type of
shift to it as well so those are what I
went there for and I love all of them
again I'm really happy with them i'm
really glad i got them and yeah they're
really cool and then since i was there i
was like well I've wanted three more of
their foiled eyeshadows for a long time
now and I thought I might as well get
them at eight dollars instead of ten
dollars piece i'll show you those next
the first one I got is whimsical and
this is a light pink foiled shadow this
comes off really cool toned on the skin
and I feel like it shows up almost like
a cool tone white it's the pink is kind
of hard to pick up but I really like
that I thought it'd be really pretty for
the inner corner or just I just really
liked it I didn't feel like I had
anything quite that metallic and
something that was that light and bright
but not white or silver the next one
here is starry-eyed this reminded me of
the two-faced leading lady shadow that
I'm trying to hit pan on and I wanted to
kind of compare them that's part of the
reason i wanted it but i just thought
that this formulation is so much better
than that one I love that shadow but I
wish it was a little creamier and I feel
like it is getting a little old so I
really wanted this one starry-eyed he's
probably my favorite one out of all of
the three that I got out of the regular
foiled I just think that anyone could
use this this is just like if you like
steal a kitten type of shades this is
perfect and the last 1i got with
daydreamer this is a light lavender
foiled shadow and I love lavender colors
and I don't have anything quite like
this one either I just I love that look
and then I was going to stop there but I
was like no but the regular shadows are
only five instead of six dollars plus
I'm not having to pay shipping or tax
and you guys know from my last video
there were a couple colors i wanted and
i ended up getting i think most of those
colors I really
happy about that because I didn't just
go there and go wild and get a bunch of
shades that I didn't know I wanted
before then I really got shades that I
had said in my previous video I just
have been telling myself I've been
wanting I feel good about that anyway I
feel like I keep giving explanations in
all my videos and make everything turn
out entirely way too long but this is
chickadee and I love this color I really
want a chickadee for like this portion
of my eye today but I didn't have it so
I thought this one now that I have it I
could use this I think the look i'm
wearing is a little more yellow then
this is this is like yellow brown orange
I'm obsessed I didn't even swatch it
actually any of the these ones I didn't
even swatch I just got them because I
knew I wanted them um I just realized
that but that's chickadee there I've
been wanting this color really nice warm
kind of like Sal oh I don't know I just
really like it it's perfect for this
look I mean I could make this look with
it I also want a cherry cola in that
video and I got it I mean look I can't
it's so pretty I just thought this would
be nice i've been using antiqued a lot
to deepen up the outer portion of my eye
but i think this would be really really
pretty to do that with so i think that's
what i'm going to use this for i just
have really been wanting this i love it
so pretty next is tiki hut this is very
similar to desert sands which is what i
have on my lid right now i'm actually
going to go get deserts and so we can
compare them let's do that so this is
desert sands and this is tiki hut so TK
is definitely darker very similar in
tone this one looks a little yellower to
me but it could just be that it's
lighter I mean I'm still happy I have
both because these are the type of
shadows that I wear and I think that
this shadow would have looked I mean I
really like my Iowa today but maybe
deepened up my eyelid a little bit more
so I could have kind of like made a
gradient between the two but this is
tiki hut anyway that's it there and
underneath it is desert sands so yeah
desert sands is a little bit more yellow
to me you don't need both so if you're
just regular person and you're not
addicted you don't need bowl you could
just do one or the other and just pick
the one that you like to me they're both
super wearable so I don't know if you
want just like a like it's not cool it's
still definitely warm but it's
definitely cooler than desert sands then
i would go tiki yet i have two more
shadows left these are classic makeup
geek shadows so oh no preppy isn't but
is a color that I've been wanting this
one again is kind of in that like grain
brown type of category I don't know if
it's picking up on camera but it looks
like a green brown that's watched a
little weird because I just wiped off my
hand with them makeup wipe but that's it
there it's like I don't know I've heard
people talk about this and not everyone
talks about it and loves it as much as
like all the other ones but the people
that have raved about this i really like
their opinion and their like style
choices so i got preppy and last i got
creme brulee and I wanted this because
to me peach smoothie to me is just not a
good enough transition like i like it
i'm gonna use it I just don't think it's
like orange soda and this one isn't like
orange soda either but I just thought
it'd be a little bit of a deeper color
if I just wanted to put this in the
crease and just leave my lid nice and
Matt I thought this would be just like a
really easy go to look okay guys that's
everything for my hall I hope you guys
enjoyed I know I'm just obsessed like
this is the year of makeup gig for me
I'm really happy that I got the chance
to get those foil to dual chrome shadows
and if they come out I definitely think
they're worth it if you guys want to
know just wanted to try them out and
then once I swatch them I was just too
sold so that's everything I hope you
guys enjoyed and then I will see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
