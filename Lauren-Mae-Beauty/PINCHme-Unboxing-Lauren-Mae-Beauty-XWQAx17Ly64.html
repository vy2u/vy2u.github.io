lauren thanks so much for watching i'm
really excited because this is going to
be a pinch me unboxing video I have my
box here they actually contacted me and
wanted to send me out there like beauty
blogger box I've heard about pinch me
but i don't think i ever signed up for
them and i've also seen a lot of other
people do like unboxing videos or talk
about them so they are a service very
similar to influenster I feel like
that's like this most similar one they
give you four examples and then in
return you review them it's entirely
free I think that's mostly it I'm going
to be unboxing this in front of the
camera phrase eyes and letting you guys
know what I think about what's in here I
don't even know I'm excited I feel like
it's been a long time since I've done
like an unboxing video and they love
that it's like a free service for people
do you know how to pay it's not like I'm
unboxing a subscription service even
though part of me has been wanting to
like do you want to Oh work how cute
super duper cute box I really like that
has little p for pinch me oh yeah I'm
second can't tell I will have a link
down below if you want to sign up for
pinch me again it's free I was told
though that this is specifically like a
beauty blogger box so for you guys it
will be different I don't know I just
feel like I should just go to not just
because it is different you get two to
three samples a month and they go live
so this is a little bit different than
influenster because you have to like
pick your samples and I think they can
like run out of samples so I wanted to
get this video up before the 11th of
April if you do decide to sign up those
are the samples they're going to be like
live and you can pick the ones you want
to get sent to you they send two to
three samples to you a month but they
change out every single month and some
of the things that are in here are past
samples future samples they aren't
necessarily samples that are going to be
shown in April another that I want to
get into the box already okay we got
little warning as a bunny would say
first thing on the box like this is the
first thing i thought those
this is the SE treat love and color it's
a strengthener for your nails but I
think it's in the color shears to you
and it's pink which is like perfect I
actually I already signed up for the
website so they sent me this and then
today I was like I'm going to sign up
and see what it's about and just see
what the process is to like sign up and
get the pinching box and I was looking
on good previous samples and this was
one of them so this isn't actually
really good sample it's like a name
brand I feel like when I was looking at
the samples a lot of the stuff on the
site is definitely more drug store
you're not going to be getting like YSL
stuff like you do with insulin sir they
also have a wide range of things so they
have like home staff health and fitness
and when you sign up you go through and
answer all these different questions so
they can know what products are going to
fit your lifestyle so that's the right
samples are available to you or options
for you to pick this is one of the ones
I saw and I was like a lots of good ones
though it's kind of awesome i got that i
will have to try this out you guys know
that I'm doing my polished picks this
year so maybe I'll just do this one net
and see how it goes pulling it out of
the actual packaging I thought it was
just like a light pink but it has this
like shift to a bright pink / golden
orange I'm excited to try that my nails
do tend to get kind of like slakey they
flake a lot especially if I've had the
applause on for a really long time so
maybe it can help treat that next we got
some food item this is osf oh no this is
the raspberry chia naturally flavored
with other natural flavors very natural
so this is called nothing but the fruit
real fruit fights well I can't taste
anything right now so I really don't
think this would even do me any good of
tasting then so I'm going to save it for
Sam but I just I won't be able to taste
it at this moment in my life I'm not the
biggest fan of getting like food and
these are looks like chocolates and I'm
down awesome but that's just me i know a
lot of other people would enjoy that
next is a little pure leaf tea bag and
this is in the taste this is in the
flavor that's what that's called screen
tea with men
I'm really excited actually for this
green tea with mint is my absolute
favorite type of tea I love having it
ice even when me and Sam will make like
70 leg lifts in Sun tea I'll put a sprig
of like mint leaves in it so it has that
mint in it it's just my favorite I love
the one at starbucks to the green tea
one it's so good so that's actually
something I'll get use out of and in
July next ears something from aqua Veila
this is a sensitive five and one after
shave balm they just let me know it's
going to get an aftershave balm in here
so i will let Sam use this I'm sure
he'll like it as long as it doesn't like
react poorly on his skin so that's kind
of nice it's lightly scented which he
will appreciate because he's very
sensitive some covergirl strathmore
makeup that's what I'm talking about I
like to make up stuff I like boxes that
you get sent makeup so I'm definitely
happy with this covergirl the test try
and buy meet the true bloods family I
think this is just like a paper sample
yeah this is a little paper sample I
probably won't use this because I'm not
a fan of like packet samples soil
samples I just tend to never use them I
never reach for them they sit in my
drawer and then I start hoarding them it
almost becomes this weird thing of like
oh I have like five samples is this Oh
another one let me add it to the
collection like how crazy is that anyway
I got an eyeliner this is the cover girl
self sharpening test perfect line
perfect point plus eyeliner it's in the
color block on it so that's exciting a
nice black eyeliner if you guys know
that I like to tightline using eyeliner
so i will try this out and see how it
works the biggest thing for me is I just
like it to stay there and not get like
weird in the outer corner and inner
corner and also not give me a film so
hopefully this works out nice because
it's cheap and drugstore I think there's
only like two more things I'm sorry to
give the noise from someone doing their
lawn it just started up next to have a
product here from LA I actually did see
this on the past samples as well this is
the ultra moisture body wash so I'm
excited for that just small as much as I
love my bath and body works and that's
what I use all the time I like having
samples of stuff like this and I like
that this isn't an actual bottle sample
it's not just
packet these are great for travel and I
also sometimes let's just switch it up
but it's not a huge bottle I feel like
you either get it in this size or like
the jumbo size from costco so I'd rather
have it in this and you can kind of
switch it up try something new I move on
to the next item I have another similar
product this is the shampoo for Pantene
and it's the daily moisture renew I only
have the shampoo in here not the
conditioner I think that's kind of weird
right like you would think you want to
try out the situation together I'm
happiest the shampoo i go through
shampoo faster than conditioner so i
will definitely use this up and try it
out it's moisturizing and i have been
fine hair so we'll see how that works
out but it's a pretty good sized example
i like that last in the box guys we're
almost to the end here are some slim
fast product so more food items this is
the slimfast advanced nutrition smoothie
and it is in the creamy chocolate
version I don't know if I'm going to use
this I'm not really a smoothie person um
I don't know I might have family can use
this up somehow um but yeah okay and
last is another slimfast a hundred
calorie snack snack bites and these are
the peanut butter chocolate snack bikes
these look pretty delicious I'll
probably eat these you know so yeah I
mean I'm not like I'm happy about that
it's chocolate I'll take it overall I
think the surface is pretty awesome it's
free it's very much like insulin stir so
if you want to try some like drug store
stuff it it kind of reminds me of the
like Walmart beauty box or Target beauty
boxes but free and not guaranteed
success I don't know for me I probably
will only put in for like beauty samples
I'm just not a fan of like getting just
like little food samples I tend to just
not eat them and then they're just in my
house and I feel bad getting rid of them
because its food anyway but overall I'm
happy with it I'll definitely say find
out myself and put in for samples as I
see ones that I think would work well
for me so I hope you guys enjoyed I will
keep you updated on the reviews from the
few beauty items that were in here
and let you guys know what I think also
if you're someone who's already tagged
that for pinch me and you like the
service or whatever if you know anything
about pinch me leave it down below in
the comments so that way I can know and
also everyone else in kind of get a gist
of what the service is about sent it's
like a free service I thought you guys
would enjoy it so I think that's
everything I'm going to end this here
and I will see you in my next video
thanks so much for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
