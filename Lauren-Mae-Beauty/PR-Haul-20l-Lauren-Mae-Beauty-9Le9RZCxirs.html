have another one um I have more PR stuff
I feel like I've been getting a lot of
stuff just recently it comes and it goes
and I'm sorry I hate to bombard you guys
but it's just kind of building up and I
just want to talk to you guys about it
that way you know what I have coming
into my collection if you guys want to
see reviews if you want to see toriel's
if you just want to know what's going on
with them anyway imported to show you
guys what's coming up what you're going
to be seeing featured on my channel soon
my mom is coming into town so I'm really
excited to have her here I'm trying to
pre-fill I'm hopefully going to film
some videos with her we might go
shopping there might be more halls to
come and then I think I'll calm down I
also have color pops upcoming I don't
know I go on phases it's like bye bye
bye nothing and right now I mean this
has been bought but right now a lot of
stuff is coming in so we'll get into it
I'm really excited about these things I
just have some fun things so first I'm
going to start off with some set burn
they contacted me again and they wanted
to send me out a new perfume so I went
on site I looked around I decided to
pick a perfume that it actually knew
what it smelt like we used to sell this
at my old beauty store and first off
look how cute the little packaging is
the last one I have is white and this
one is like a pink metallic really
pretty if you haven't heard about
numbers like a monthly subscription but
for perfume you get a travel sized like
this I believe it's $15 a month and it
should have enough sprays in there for
30 days I think it's a good site if you
are wanting to like try out different
perfumes and you don't know what you
like I think it's you know worth it I
don't think it's for everyone but I
definitely think if you're someone who
wants to try to confer fumes it's a good
option okay so what I got is the comp to
our SID Pacific cocoa in fig this smells
like coconut and fig and it smells so
good I already knew I loved it like I
said it's such a great summer scent it
smells so good
after I sprayed the same as I do with
that it smells good I was like I know I
just love this I definitely suggest it
fig is one of my favorite signs coconut
and one of my favorite signs put them
together it's a match made in heaven
the last scent I picked up was from
Malin and guests and it was a Moroccan
fig and that also has a notes of fig and
coconut that one was definite
more of a almost like a clean fresh
Moroccan big coconut scent this one is
definitely more tropical definitely
summer it smells a little more creamy
the closest thing I can think that it
smells like is the petite tropical dry
shampoo I feel like it smells kind of
similar to that so if you smell that
that's kind of the vibe you're going to
get like basically that to me it's like
exactly the same but you know this is a
lot more expensive than a direction so
anyway I really enjoyed this I really
liked it in the description box I'll
have some like discount codes it's not
affiliate but if you haven't tried out
scent Burton you want to try it out I
will have some like coupon code three
guys to see something okay next I'm
going to talk about some skincare and
this is from the brand made simple
skincare they reached out to me Julianne
reached out to me I believe she's like
the owner of the company she's like the
coolest sweetest person ever
she's like this real person on email I
really enjoyed that I really enjoyed the
brand this brand is really awesome it's
raw vegan non-gmo cruelty-free I'm just
really pumped to these items she sent me
seven things which is like mind-blowing
so thank you so much and I will be doing
a full-on review I decided to show you
it here so you guys kind of know what's
coming up so first up I wanted to show
you guys the toothpaste type of products
these are some of the best sellers on
her site something I really liked too is
that everything was really affordable so
I was like oh good like if I really like
something I won't be like it when I want
to repurchase it this is the mint sweet
orange toothpaste
it has barrels no fluoride heals gums
with antibacterial oils and it's for
sensitive teeth and really excited about
this but actually when it came it was
really hot so it was like liquid so it's
an oil and then you put it I put it in
the fridge and so it's good to go now
I'll show you guys what it looks like
that's what it looks like I'm super
excited to try that out I have a lot of
teeth stuff coming in I don't know what
what's that thing
no but yeah I'm excited to try that this
is another tooth item or mouth item I
don't know really what to oral care I
don't this is the acute and gum tone
experiment clove I really like the sound
of that ice melted it also smells really
nice
I'm excited to try that out me and Sam
marbles he also really likes like more
natural products like more holistic type
of stuff like yeah he's really into that
yeah it smells good my mom is definitely
gonna want to try this out when she's
here and then on to skincare I totally
had oily skin but then I also tend to
like it's dehydrated I call though I'm
oily
I still get dry patches and I do feel
like I have dehydrated skin at the same
time so she sent over what she thought
would work for me first here is a face
wash oil this is a chamomile and Palmer
Rosa I think that's how you say that
it's light and refreshing clean taste
and removes makeup with a hundred
percent oil zero so I'm excited to try
this I am NOT the biggest fan of like
oils on the face but I also feel like
I've never been at a place where I
really wanted to do my skincare like I
have now so I will definitely get this a
good go see how it works the reason that
she contacted me is because I made this
list on this website called hubba I did
a whole thing of fake masks because you
guys know I'm like into the face mask I
saw some the nest on on the site of hers
and I was like oh these look good this
is the formula oh man she's really
testing me with these names this rule in
the hemp face mask I mean this is
anti-aging superfood mask gives a
regenerative glow and these are all for
sensitive skin I believe so this is
actually a dry mask that you add water
to in a nonmetallic Bowl I'm really
excited to try that out definitely like
a different take so that is super
exciting I just did a face mask last
night like I really feel like face mask
can take your life in your game like
change it wow I'm like looking so short
let me change that I think that looks a
little bit better I don't look like I'm
just like totally soft and even though I
am three more items to show you guys in
that same kind of like purple range this
is the face serum with rosehip and camel
mal I'm really excited to try this all
the bottles are glass which i think is
so awesome they also all have like
expiration dates on the bottom which i
think is great so that you know when
your skincare is going to go bad smells
very natural it feels nice I really like
it's kind of refreshing kind of like
gardens and then she sent me two of the
things from this orange line which I
don't know if they I don't know if
things are like in the same line because
of the packaging or not but they don't
both have orange so this first one here
is the face toner hydrosoul and this is
the orange blossom bergamot this is
supposed to refresh season hydrate it
helps set makeup I'm excited to try that
one out it's kind of tiny actually for
being a face mist so we'll see how fast
I run through it but I'm excited I love
toners and I especially love when
they're in a spray bottle it just makes
it so much easier when you're getting
ready for bed at night and just getting
ready you know just move on instead of
like getting a cotton pad out blah blah
blah you know if you can't tell I'm used
to a very simple impurities okay and the
last item here from made simple this is
the face serum and it's the pumpkin
juniper and it's an anti acne purifying
and balancing serum this is for oily
skin I'm really excited to try this I
think this would be great for my husband
too
although he's not oily he has breakouts
it's like the weirdest he has very
strange skin and then this one also
smells very like just natural almost
like dirt but like in a good way like
you feel one's nature I don't know I'm
excited to try that out definitely not
like a scary natural scent I'm excited
I'm just so excited to try this products
out if you get to tried any of them
please let me know what your thoughts
are down below I would love to know I
want to know I want to know now we're
going to move on to the stuff that I've
gotten from Offaly I feel like usually I
get like one kind of like set of
products a month but somehow the way
that timing is I've gotten like two sets
this month so that's why I feel like
I've had a really big bombardment of
like products but I'm super excited
about everything that I have here anyway
I saw this shampoo and conditioner on
the site and I was really excited this
is the vibrant sexy hair sulfate free
color lock shampoo and conditioner
um if you guys didn't know I have pink
hair if you've ever had pink hair or any
color hair you know that the color just
drains from your hair every time I take
a shower I have a different color of
hair so I'm excited to try these out see
if this will help prolong my color a
little bit longer you know as much as I
use my shower
died I don't want to do it every single
time in the shower like I just I don't
want to even do it down husband
so plus it's like wasting product or you
know the faster I run through it the
faster I spend money on it so you can
help prolong my hair color I would be
very happy
please have it Rose almond scent which I
smells really good in the bottle I hope
that it won't be too overpowering to my
hair we will see I will definitely let
you know what I think about the smell
once I've used it something I was
totally ecstatic that I got accepted for
this is the sol de janeiro and this is
the Brazilian before playing
moisturizing shower cream gel now if you
watch my videos you know I really like
this I got this roughly as well it's the
Sol de Janeiro Brazilian whip butter I
keep this in my purse I didn't have like
barely any left me and Sam are planning
a trip for next summer and I'm like I
want this there so I'll have to
repurchase it because I really want to
have like the scent memory of this it
feels good on the lips it smells so good
Sam really likes it like this things on
my person lives with me and I love it
so when I saw this on the site I was so
excited they also have a lot of like
creams and lotions but I'm not a really
big body lotion person so I just know
I'm not going to use the bottom cream
like no matter how good it smells it's
still going to be a chore to use it up
so when I saw shower gel I was like girl
yes I want to be in the shower in the
tropics this smells really good but I
think it smells like it does smell
different to me than this so I'm excited
to put this in the shower see what it
smelled like when I'm like getting my
studs on listening to my music listen to
post Malone listen to some Drake rapping
in the shower see how they smell
while I'm in there I will let you know
if it's like just as good I've never
smelt the buns on cream Minako and loves
it but if it sold like this it does it
smells really good guys don't miss best
one day I've ever smelled but it's
definitely like a good time
like I definitely enjoy it I love
tropical coconut eat Texans so I think
that's enough about this haven't tried
it out yet if you have let me know you
think I kind of want to get the body
mists that's from them too because
everyone's talking about it
and I feel like I'd really enjoy it but
I also I'm like do I need it I don't
know Jacqueline would say I do moving on
I have a couple more skincare items I
have two masks from
my legs again with the masks I know I
seriously only had that one charcoal
mask that you guys saw in my last
monthly favorites I'll leave a link down
below if you haven't seen that video so
I just I've really been like wanting to
do more masks but I think it's just like
a fun thing I do it while I paint my
nails I do already watch a show they
don't take that long I feel like
sometimes they build it up like it's
going to take forever it's like it's 15
minutes of your life calm down Lauren
anyway I got one that's to restore this
is a moisture rich mask and I'm really
excited for this because although I have
oily skin it definitely feels dehydrated
sometimes this is something that you put
on and then you can leave it on for ten
to three minutes take it off you can
also just kind of like remove the excess
and leave some of it on cosmetics is a
brand that I know not a lot of people
know but we also sold this at my last
beauty store it's so funny one of the
reps would always come in and her name
was Pam and Pam oh man she could sell to
everyone she would like sit you down and
sell to you she was that one I can still
sell things at cosmetic counters Oh Pam
oh it's so we're going to have like old
memories right I don't know anyway the
other one here is an activated charcoal
mask and it's for detoxing your skin so
for more oily skin acne prone skin I use
this last night I did really enjoy it I
looked up activated charcoal because
chalky was talking about activated
charcoal in that one video and I'm just
like because activated charcoal mean
anything like what's the difference
between like a charcoal mask and an
activated charcoal mask
I guess when it's activated it like
helps pull out impurities in a skimpy
take like pills to help was like
detoxing your body especially for like
drug overdoses and like alcohol
poisoning and different types of
poisoning so I guess it kind of works a
similar way with like the impurities of
your skin I don't know I think activated
actually doesn't mean something that
when I lift it up anyway I did enjoy
this this smelt like a cocktail um I
don't know what you smelt kind of like
an alcoholic beverage it went on the
skin it definitely had a way different
feel than the other charcoal mask that I
have from derma e this when it dried
down all the coverage it felt like this
weird velvet latex like it's not a peel
mask you just wipe it off but it
definitely didn't feel like dry and
chalky it felt yeah like velvet latex
is very strange I don't know if I put
enough on you're supposed to put a
really big like layer but I didn't put
too too big of a later so I'm going to
try it out see how I like it it kind of
burned at first but then it didn't burn
throughout whereas the other ones didn't
burn immediately but burns kind of
throughout I don't know we'll see with
more uses how I like this I think this
is the last item so it's not too long of
a haul right I don't know it's kind of
more fun I try to keep this fun the last
thing here this is from Real Techniques
and this is the appointed L brush I
believe this is part of a series of
brushes that are supposed to be like
multi tech so you can do multiple things
with them they're not a brush dress for
blush or just for foundation today I use
this for the first time I filmed the
whole first impressions I will leave
that link down below
I do really enjoy this brush it's super
soft super nice I don't like it for
highlighting I don't like it for under
the eyes but for powder for browser and
for foundation it worked really well so
I'm very happy with it I will definitely
be using this in my collection I might
move it into my kit I think it's a nice
brush i usual techniques all the time in
my daily life also I have them in my set
bag so yeah I really like this and this
did not disappoint
ok that is everything guys I'm gonna
stop filming for the day I'm going to
film a bunch tomorrow and I hope you
guys are having a wonderful day please
let me know if you tried to making if
you have any suggestions for max I would
love to know them I know I asked that
and one of my other videos but just like
keep them coming
guys we all want to know what masks do
you think work really well I have some
Sephora gift cards that I want to maybe
buy a couple things with I don't know
yeah I would love to know your
suggestions I'll stop rambling I hope
you're having a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
