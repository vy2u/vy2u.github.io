Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a PR haul so that means
everything that I'm showing you in this
video I was either sent for free or
somehow received for free now I get free
things because I'm a youtuber and so
yeah companies contact me I get a lot of
steps through austell e an influencer
and then on top of that I am a working
makeup artist too so I have connections
that way as well with companies 3 will
be kind of like I guess makeup group I'm
involved in when it comes to the shows I
work on and stuff anyway I kind of have
a lot of stuff that's accumulated
recently and I thought it'd be just fun
to show you all in one video now all of
that being said anything that I received
for free I always give you guys 100%
honest review it's just part of the
beauty industry getting free stuff I
know that YouTube has kind of made it
very like public and glamorized but even
if you are not a youtuber if you work at
a beauty store or if you are somehow
involved in the beauty industry you will
get products for free it's just how it
works so anyway I hope you guys enjoy
this let me know if you like PR hauls or
if you don't or whatever I'd love to
hear you guys thoughts in the comments
the let's just get into what I gotta let
you know where I got it I'll leave links
if you want them I don't have any like
brand specific affiliated links or
anything for you guys so yeah anyway
let's just get into it I just was like
filling up this bag so I'm going to
start off with what's on top here I
received the term Influenster and this
is the aqua de Gio Giorgio Armani
perfume this is for guys so really Sam
got this this smells really nice I just
got it today
if you don't follow me on instagram you
should I had him like do us a little
like
boomerang with it and it was just fun
and also yeah I each full Minister
Grande I'm trying to post more
consistently on there yeah anyway if you
just want to like know more about my
life and stuff it's always fun over
there anyway I do really like this it
smells really nice and this is actually
one that we were thinking about getting
him he only has two other colognes he
has one from L'Occitane which is really
nice I will leave it linked if you want
to check it out I don't know like the
exact name of it so that's why I'm gonna
link it and then the other one he has is
actually from Armani and it's
Monni code and I really like to smell
that one it's definitely like a lighter
scent and more fresh and I do enjoy it I
think it smells good I'm excited for him
to wear this I'm down with it
and they were like nice enough to send
the 3.4 ounce bottle which is crazy I
was kind of expecting like a 1 ounce or
something but this is the big papa
next I wanted to talk about something
for a brand where they just reached out
to me through my email this is from
carbonate cocoa and I have seen this
kind of floating around Instagram and so
when I reached out I was really
interesting kind of wanted to try it out
and see what it was about this is like a
charcoal toothpaste it's like for
natural teeth whitening so like they
gave you me a little a tooth brush which
I appreciate because the bristles of it
are actually like grey so that way I'm
sure you don't like see your dingy tooth
brush but inside here it's literally
like charcoal dust yeah it's like lack
of night black of your soul baby so I'm
excited to try this out I've been so
busy a month of May that I haven't done
it yet so I'm going to be gained
probably like a whole comprehensive like
review on this with like photos of my
teeth before and after and like using it
for a while so I'm really excited about
that I thought I would give you a little
bit more info on it just keep brushing
jar brush your teeth for three minutes
spit out rinse and then brush with the
toothpaste which I don't have so I guess
I'll just wash it with my normal
toothpaste but I'm excited to try this
out if you guys have tried it yourself
please let me know we think of it down
below
I like partially excited partially
nervous but you know that excited energy
that tell you what I feel about that
product next I want to talk about some
things that I received from my manager
Michelle these are all brands that she
like has reached out to and kind of
works with so that we can use on set and
in our kit and so I have some fun new
stuff for my kit which is always
exciting the first thing here is a
sunless tanner and this is a spray tan
from side effects it's always nice to
have a spray tan in your kit you never
know how someone's going to come into
you what state they're like makeups
going to be in or anything like that so
it's always nice you can even someone
else it's going to be a photo shoot
where they're in like saving suits like
for the abbé we did a Palm Springs
shoot where they're like you know white
so this like came in handy just to make
sure that they were all evened out and
like looking
the best that they could even though
everyone on the show was like beautiful
anyway so I'm excited to have that in my
kit I really didn't have something like
that so it's good to have that now
I have quite a few things from Bioderma
which i think is funny because I
literally went and bought an eye cream
from Bioderma to put in my kid like two
days before I went to the Bioderma like
demo which is where I got all these
projects I have a pore refiner lotion
here which will be great for my kids for
people with more oily skin I have the
ice cream which is what I thought this
is the eye contour gel and I already
have this in my kit so I'm going to keep
this as a backup either for myself or my
kid whichever comes first
I got some moist which is really cool
these are soaked in the micellar water
which is like one of their top line
products it's probably what you've heard
of from Bioderma especially from youtube
i've tried one of these actually and I
didn't like it I didn't think it was
soaked enough so I will like finish
these up but I just prefer the micellar
water which is what's next I love
Bioderma
you guys know I'm a huge fan micellar
waters I like the Guardian wine I like
the simple one this is my first micellar
waters love I remember when me and Sam
went to Paris I was like scouring the
pharmacies to find it and I brought home
for these like I bought two Double Packs
to bring home with me yeah I love this
it's like funny memories remembering me
and Sam like on the hunt for this but
anyway highly suggest that if it's
really good it is more expensive than
like say the Garnier one and the simple
one but this was kind of like the
original and then last for Bioderma this
is the hydra bio serum and it's a
moisturizing concentrate I put this in
my favorites video because I've really
been enjoying it I really like the way
too sinks into the skin it hydrates
without feeling thick and heavy and I
really feel like it's like long-term
hydration I can feel it from the moment
I put it on it seems in super fast and I
feel hydrated then but I also feel
hydrated hours later and Forestier and
this is really inexpensive I have a few
more products from Michelle I have some
rescue skin these are like samples but I
also feel like this is how they package
their stuff this is the serum
concentrate and this is the ultra
moisturizer
I really haven't used their products so
I'm excited to use these and honestly I
kind of like that there is packets like
this make some super easy to use on set
you're not like wasting products
because you can just use what's in a
packet so I'm excited to try those out
they're also great just to have on the
go in your kit and they don't take up a
lot of room I have a hair product here
this is from Karen ich and this is the
list and repair treatment spray this
basically helps to seal one end and it
also is a heat protectant which is
basically what I'm going to use it as I
do hair and makeup for like second wife
club I do both of those this will really
help to use before I go on a pop tool
amazing one from Kendra now but I will
switch out any of this one and see how
it works and lasts for that stuff I have
a mascara from Dalton this is the effort
lash and I don't know how this works I
will put her in my kit and see it
doesn't really matter what the brush
looks like or anything because I'm going
to be using it in my kit and it's using
disposable ones but I can always use a
mascara so as long as it doesn't smudge
all over the lower lash line or the
upper lash line I will like it and lasts
for this haul I have some things that I
got from optilead you guys know I love
options it's so much fun I love trying
out anything from the site they always
have new stuff it's just great I love it
I excited to pick up a few things from
Eden mineral I've already done a whole
video on them I will leave that link
down below if you want to check them out
these products are very much in the same
like frame of mine and vein that I'm
like going in with my makeup something
more natural these are more mineral
based they just have like better
ingredients for your skin they're not
necessarily like full coverage so I
wanted to try some out the first thing
here is a concealer duo I'm a little
nervous because I don't know if this is
going to be light enough for me but
maybe it will once I like translates
onto the skin so those are some swatches
I feel like even this darker one might
work as like a way to counteract dark
circles it's not super salmony but it
does have a bit of like a peachy
undertone so I'm excited to try this out
and see how it works I'll be doing a get
ready with me with some of these
products I think just trying them out
next for makeup I did decide to pick up
another eyeshadow quad now if you watch
the first original video I did on eaten
minerals
I got a quad and I loved the colors but
I did not like the way that it looked
my eyes like I could not make it work so
I decided to give a different cloud a
try and see if I like this one so this
is definitely more neutral the other
ones have like a really pretty like
purple color it had almost like a
duochrome to it is really beautiful
these are all shimmering except for this
one it's basically a matte with some
glitter shot through it it's not as
intense as those types of shadows from
like two things to urban decay but these
are really beautiful I'm really hoping
that I can make them work on the eye I
think they're really nice they're super
pigmented those are some swatches of
them there so I'm excited to try and I
look I have been going a little bit more
neutral with my eyes as well so we'll
see if this one has a better score for
me than the other one did and then last
I picked up a brush and I was so excited
for this makeup brushes are always a
good thing I love makeup brushes this
one is the stippling brush and I really
want to use this for foundation I do
have their north skin foundation which
is really nice and luminous so I'm going
to try this with that and just different
ones in my collection I love dual fiber
brushes like this to apply foundation on
the skin because you can get a really
nice thin layer and not something to
take tub and that is what I like if I'm
not going to be using a sponge so I'm
excited to try this one out and I was
very very happy with how soft this felt
I feel like sometimes duo fibers like
the top is soft but then these side
bristles are kind of like rough and the
entire brush is just oh so soft I love
it and last the last thing I have to
show you guys this is from Clarins
and this is an eye pencil this is
waterproof and in the color copper they
have two shades I don't know if there's
a limited edition but I kind of chose
between the gold one in the copper one
and I chose the copper because I thought
this would just make my eyes pop so much
one side is a sponge and I used to not
really give a crap about the sponges but
it really does help to like blend out
without like removing the product so I'm
excited to try this bunch actually and
that's a swatch of it they're really
pretty this is pretty pigmented so I'm
excited to try this out see how it looks
on the eyes and see if it kind of like
stays in place it's supposed to be
waterproof so you know it should be a
long-lasting pencil and I'm excited to
do some fun looks with this okay guys
that is everything for my haul let me
know if you've tried any of the stuff if
you liked it or if there's anything you
like specifically want to see like a
more of a review on or a video on or
anything like that please leave that
down below thank you so much for
watching guys I hope you're having an
amazing day and I will see you in my
