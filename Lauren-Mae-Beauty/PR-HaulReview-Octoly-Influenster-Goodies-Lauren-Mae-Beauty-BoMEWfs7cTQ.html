Lauren this is going to be a key our
whole I have a few things from
optionally and i also have influenced
your box box that i thought i would show
you guys these are all items that were
sent to me for free for like PR purposes
or review purposes no this is sponsored
though it's just free products so let's
just get into it I want to start off
with probably my favorite stuff or the
silver I've had the most experience with
so far this is malicious and this is one
of their scrubs if you guys have been
subscribed to me for a while you know
that I've actually try delicious scrubs
before and my old work we use to sell
them and I absolutely love them this one
specifically is the coconut one and it
smells so good i love the coconut scent
from them it's not overly sweet it's
just so amazing and what i love about
these sugar scrubs is that it's a
whipped consistency it feels just so
luxurious on the skin i usually scrub my
legs the moso i'll rub it into my legs
and as it dissolves it turns into this
nice like moisturize almost like oil
feeling but a little bit thicker it
keeps your legs nice and moisturized and
if you want you can shave after with
like the remnants that's on your legs
from this scrub I love this crab it's so
good it is pricey but I purchase one by
myself I had this set before I think it
was the like sugar like sugar cookie but
it was like the sugar sand it smells
like a bakery it smells so good and I
don't even like those tix two cents but
now I'm realizing maybe I do because I
feel like I'm constantly talking about
them but yeah I love this grub it's so
great I highly recommend these if you're
wanting to splurge i recommend malicious
and the other product that i applied for
an awfully was the shower oil and bubble
bath and this is in the scent sugar tea
air flower I don't have to type say it I
wish it was the coconut scent I'm not
gonna lie cuz I'm partial but this still
smells good it's a very unique scent I
don't feel like a lot of stuff smells
like this if I had to place it it's kind
of grayish but kind of licorice but like
also like vintage I know that makes it
sound like it smells bad and it but it
doesn't it does smell good it's
definitely unique it's not my favorite
scent from the line I like the sugar
recent they have like a lemon said they
have a lavender scent that's like
limited edition I do like the other
sense better than this one but the
product itself is super nice as you can
see it's very liquidy
it's like a shower oil but it lathers up
amazing you need the tiniest amount it's
kind of hard to only get a little bit
like on your loofah but I try really
hard just to like barely tip it and then
I can sense it up it smells up the whole
shower I really have been enjoying this
I definitely feel like it moisturizes
but it doesn't leave any type of film or
oil residue at all so it's not like the
sugar scrub this like leaves you feeling
clean but not like squeaky clean just
nice clean moisturised normal no oil
residue overall I'm just like loving
those items I just think the brand
itself is really awesome I just like
their products alive and everything I've
tried for them i really love i love
their hand creams those are so nice i
haven't tried their body lotions it was
really nice too and then in their little
package they just sent me this little
freebie this is the delicious the oil I
think it's a body oil i have not tried
this yet i'm not very big on oil thing
so that's part of the reason why i love
this brand choose because even though i
don't like feeling super like greasy or
oiled up i love the products that they
have with oil in them and that seems
like so amazing for me let's just finish
up with the rest of the stuff I got from
obsolete I applied for some big sexy
hair things because I needed some hair
products I really want to try some new
stuff out there's a theme with these
it's all about thickening the hair so
all the products that I got are all
about like thicker more voluminous hair
the first thing that I wanted to try out
was the get layered hair spray and this
is the flash drag thickening hairspray I
don't use hairspray a ton but I did want
to try this out and I also wanted to try
it in my kit because not only do I like
to have volume but anyone I do any hair
on wants the volume too so I really want
to try this out see how it works I've
tried other things from the brand that I
liked so I thought it would be worth a
shot another product that I picked up
was the powder play and I actually have
a small size of this and I'm almost done
with it so this is a great product for
for first day hair you can put this in
at the roots and kind of give your hair
a little bit of grit and texture
especially if you're doing like an updo
or something like that this will give
you some grit and texture so that your
hair doesn't just like fall limp if you
have thin fine hair you know what I'm
talking about volumizing powders are
definitely a great way to get that
second day lived-in feeling on first day
hair it definitely does feel a little
bit like
gritty dirty but kind of needs some of
that to actually like have some style
and for your hair to like just have some
volume and some life to it so I really
like this and I think it's a great
product and the last thing I picked up
is the push-up instant volume thickening
finish spray so I use this product this
morning and it just helped give a little
bit of volume to my hair for when I put
it up I like that messy bun type of look
and again with my thin fine hair it's
hard to do so products like this are
great just to kind of spray at the roots
spray into the sides here so that way I
can get some voluminous on just like
slipped down to my head I really want to
try this though with my hair down and
see how that works I'm really excited
for this product as well I've really
been trying to like get my hair together
I'm taking like vitamins and all this
other stuff and using different shampoos
and all that so I'm really pumped for
those products and the last thing I
wanted to show you guys was my box box
this is the formula x box box and if you
guys don't know what influence terez or
octiline links will be down below
definitely check them out there just
waits for you to be able to try products
for brands and give reviews so that way
they can know about their products and
also they can get some recognition for
their products as well so the first
impression of this box was not good I
got a sent to me and when I opened it up
it smelt like acetone and I was like oh
no oh no what so the item that leaked
all over the place was this this is the
formula X delete all and it's that
product from Sephora you stick your
fingers in and it's supposed to like
clean off all your nails and this was
the thing I was the most excited for so
I was so bummed when it came and it was
open this definitely has a packaging
issue it's just like plastic but it
doesn't it's hard to get it to close all
the way or wasn't closed all the way
when they sent it they even put it
inside a plastic bag but the plastic bag
wasn't even closed so it didn't help
anything so that came busted then this
is the nail polish we got which is a
really pretty color it's very similar to
butter london's trout pout and this is
the colour tgif i've used this and I do
really like the color of it I actually
was gonna paint my nails with trout pout
and it was like oh I probably should
just use the one they sent me because it
looks the same it's like the same color
just to try out the formula so I do
really like the color but the reason I
the cap is because the cap totally got
demolished with the acetone and I think
maybe the heat it was like yellow and
kind of melted it was crazy like you
realize how intense acetone is when you
get a box that like looks like an acid
attack happened in it so I ripped off
the tops of this and I actually kind of
like it better because now when it's in
my drawer I can see the color whereas
the cap would normally cover all of that
and then the other three products that
were in that box are they like cleanser
the base coat topcoat now I was excited
to try these two these luckily just the
outside packaging were messed up but I
just threw away the caps anyways like I
kind of like him without the couch
overall with it being like messed up I
was really not wanting to try this box
like it just kind of put about tasting
off I know that's stupid because it's
just outside packaging except for the
delete all that one like half the
product and it did like leak out but I
decided finally to give it a try and
I'll say when I put this on and I use
these products I really did like it it
stayed on my nails for a super long time
it was really glossy I just felt like it
was a nice manicure and you guys know I
don't pay my nails all the time even
today I have an icy color on I think
it's like I don't know i'll leave it
down below it's like a limited edition
when i just picked up at marshalls but I
used the cleanser the base coat and the
top coat with it because I liked how
well it lasted on my nails so I really
wanted to use these with this manicure
one of my favorite things about all
three of the like based products I don't
know what to call them not like the
color product they have a really nice
brush it's very similar to wet and wild
mega last formula with their brushes
it's just a really nice wide brush that
can get your whole nail super easy super
fast so I really like it the only thing
is this brush for whatever reason after
I use it on one nail it'll like separate
and I think it's just cuz the cleanser
which is kind of like glorified acetone
it just doesn't have any weight to it so
there's nothing to keep the brush
together once there is less product on
the brush and that's something that's a
little bit irritating but that doesn't
happen with the other two product so
that's why I think it's just because the
consistency of the product inside is
different with the color product I
really like the color it looked really
nice the formula was nice
did streak it also i really like the way
this applied this does not have the same
brush though as the top coat base coat
and I was kind of disappointed on that
because i like the brush so much it was
still easy to put this on I just was
expecting it to have that nice brush
because the other ones did this is the
product i was the most excited for so
that's why I was just so bummed but I
did try this and it's it works really
well and that's with half the product
and it I really didn't think that I
could stick my finger in there move it
around and it would come off but it
really did it worked i don't know how it
does it literally can't just be like
ding oh it's out but i mean it's pretty
dang close to that like wow you know so
I'm really like pleasantly surprised
with this box especially with the like
first impression I had of it I really do
like the products I'm really happy with
how well the nail polish date on and I'm
excited to continue using the top and
base coat in the cleanser with my other
manicures so I do think formula at least
for this polish it was a great it was a
great experience so besides the shipping
haha those are all the products that
I've been recently kind of like testing
out and have been sent I hope you guys
enjoy this video let me know if you've
tried any of these things down below and
if you like them and I will see you in
the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
