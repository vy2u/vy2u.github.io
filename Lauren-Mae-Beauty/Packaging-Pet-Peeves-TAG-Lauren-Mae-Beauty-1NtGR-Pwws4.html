channel it's Lauren today's video is
actually a tag video I was tagged by
Vives Mac I will leave her channel link
down below and this is the packaging pet
peeve Tech she made this tag up there
aren't any questions but this tag as you
could probably guess is all about the
packaging pet peeves that we all have as
makeup lovers and beauty lovers we try a
lot of different products and sometimes
the packaging is amazing it's beautiful
or it helps us in our everyday lives and
it just makes things easier and other
times it is let's just say it hell or it
sucks or it breaks or it just does not
work or it's just hideous
so this tag is all about ranting about
that get some things off your chest
share what you find annoying about
packaging it's a little bit negative but
I think that we all can kind of relate
to this and I think it's still just like
a fun video and like she'd mentioned in
her video that potentially maybe someone
could think about changing their
packaging if they see this video also
I've never mentioned this on my channel
but my number one makeup goal like in my
makeup career is to have my own line of
cosmetics I'm a product junkie at heart
and I would love to create my own line
so to me packaging is a super important
thing most of the stuff that I have here
it's all defective so there's just
something wrong with it it doesn't work
well it just doesn't help facilitate
using the product I don't have anything
ugly only because I feel like most the
time I won't buy something if I find it
ugly like I just I don't gravitate to
that I'm not gonna buy something that's
super ugly you probably especially if
it's expensive so yeah I attack each and
every one of you guys to do this and to
tell everyone and get some things off
your chest but let us know what your
packaging pet peeves are other than that
let's get into the tech video there are
varying degrees of annoyance with these
products so the first one these are
actually like the most annoying to me
this is the Josie Maran watercolor
eyeshadows I love these I love you so
much and it's so frustrating to me that
I have to put these in this video
because I didn't know that it had to
until
recently so I will link the video down
below where this literally broke on me
but as you can see this is like an
eyedropper it looks kind like an
eyedropper but instead it has like a doe
foot applicator but oh wait where is the
doe foot oh it fell off so there is an
issue with this packaging where because
it's submerged in the product and it's
what it falls off I had never heard that
before and I had mentioned it in that
video because it broke off in that video
and all of you guys were saying that
that is common with these products so I
just think that is absolute ridiculous
you pay a lot of money for this product
and if it cannot uphold itself in its
normal condition like I've done nothing
to this that is what I shouldn't I mean
it's just because the product itself
like this is how it's supposed to be and
it deteriorates I think that is such a
packaging fail that it's just
frustrating as a customer so this would
be like my number one super annoying
especially because it's high-end and
again I'm not doing anything different
it's because it's submerged in the
product like it's supposed to be that it
broke off like how annoying is that next
I'm going to talk about some packaging
that also just breaks and is super
annoying but these are cheaper so you
can kind of potentially say that because
it's cheap they don't spend a lot but
these are the NYX jumbo pencil jumbo eye
pencils and I'm sure if you guys have
any of these that you know the caps
break every single one of these caps is
cracked or broken in some way and it's
annoying because when you put the cap on
there's no like stopper for it so it
just keeps going in it'll crack all of
these are cracked I just find that
that's super annoying and irritating
because it happens to every single one
I've heard so many people talk about it
so I know that it's not just me being
too rough with it or something so that's
just annoying I wish they would just
change the packaging find a way for the
cap to not be so cheap or something so
that these these didn't get cracked up
and look so dingy I haven't found that
it like makes the product dry out but I
can only imagine I mean it's a cream
product potentially it could I'm a few
lip products that I think the packaging
is annoying on this one is kind of more
of a general packaging fail for me this
is a lipstick from the Fergie
nine its envy but love and the problem I
have with this is that the lipstick is
constantly out so I've barely used this
and I can't roll it down anymore so
because the product is out like that
when you go to put the lid on you
sometimes just like you know get a whole
chunk off of it super frustrating this
one actually I don't know if you can
tell has already been damaged because of
that it's seriously like a who know like
hopefully I don't totally ruin my
lipstick I just bought I just hate that
I think that it's just like you buy
something and you're like it's like a
guessing game if you're gonna ruin it
immediately when you get it I just wish
that it was you could roll it down roll
it up like a normal lipstick tube so I
just really despise packaging for
lipsticks where the product is like
sticking out and can easily be chipped
off another pet peeve for lip packaging
is just potted lip products I still buy
them and I think they're okay for when
you're by your bedside table at night or
something but you cannot go around and
use these on a daily basis because it's
just super unsanitary if you are out
shopping about and you need to put some
lipstick on like you'd have to sanitize
your hands and then get into this put on
your lips then you have stuff on your
hands because you went into the product
and put on your lips it's just kind of
an irritating product packaging for me I
get that potentially this is how it has
to go but I just it's just definitely
not my favorite and it definitely would
deter me from buying it or deter me from
using it in all situations I would have
to use it in very specific situations
and I don't know it's just kind of
annoying packaging to me my last lip
product packaging pet peeve would have
to be the bite agave lip mask this isn't
like a little squeeze tube which seems
like Oh easy but it's like a metal
squeeze tube so it's kind of hard to
squeeze and then it also like once you
start squeezing it it I don't know if
it's the pressure or what but it just
keeps using out very slowly but like
continuously using for how expensive
this is it's just kind of like you're
taking that it's just so hard to squeeze
like it's so difficult to squeeze out
this product and I don't know like it's
definitely something that I can't just
move on from it's something that sticks
in my mind whenever I use this product
that it's like so difficult to use
I have to put the cap on and like hurry
and do that because it just keeps using
out once you get it going it's just I
don't enjoy this packaging at all I've
talked about the packaging annoyance on
this product this product is in my
project pan roulette and it is
frustrating because as you can see there
are like metal ridges in this pan and I
don't know exactly why they do the metal
ridges it could be that it helps hold
the product in when it's completely
regular like it just the ridges somehow
when they press the product in keep it
in there better because it has like more
surface area or I have no idea but
that's the only thing I could think but
because of those ridges as you hit pan
your product easily crumbles away and
it's frustrating because you buy this
product because it's so big you're like
yeah I'm getting so much product for my
money but then you know because of this
stuff just ends up crumbling away as you
use it it's just frustrating to me I
wish that it was just a solid like
smooth pan instead of having the ridges
so that way you could actually use the
product or if it's so big and you need
the ridges just make a smaller pan and
charge less money for it because I'm not
actually getting all my money's worth
out of this it's crumbling away and
falling on the floor and I can't
actually use it so in reality I'm
probably going to be using the amount
that would be in a smaller pan without
the ridges if that makes sense so this
is just something that's annoying to me
and I think maybe people don't think
about that part where like if you're
trying to use it up what would happen to
it they're just thinking about like how
to keep the product safe when they first
make it so that they're not like
shipping damage and stuff but it's just
so it's super frustrating to me I have a
body scrap here this is actually the
packaging I prefer but we all know that
body scrubs and sugar scrubs usually
come in tub some of my favorite ones do
I love the tree hut ones I love the low
licious one and they come in the tubs
and that standard packaging I get it I'm
not like completely annoyed but Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works puts out their scrubs in
squeeze tubes it's amazing I mean I
don't know why they can't figure out and
put it in a squeeze tube as well
seriously I'm in the shower I'm naked
waters like running down
my hand as I'm going into the tub and so
then all this water gets into the tub of
sugar scrub and I try to pour it out so
that way I'm not like dissolving the
product like that's what I'm thinking in
my head like oh no if the water stays in
there all the sugar will get dissolved
and it'll like not be as good it's just
a little bit of a process like I feel
like I go in with like a game plan to
like use my scrub every time I use it in
the shower and this packaging just
eliminates the need for a game plan like
it's kind of psycho that I have a game
plan to use sugar scrubs and I just
really prefer this I just wish that more
brands did there sugar scrubs in
squeezed packaging because it just makes
it so much easier in the shower to get
exactly how much you want it has it's
not even like a twist cap it's just a
pulldown cap so it's just super easy and
convenient in this packaging and I just
wish more brands did their scrubs in
packaging like this I have two kind of
packaging fields when it comes to
pallets I'm very simple when it comes to
pallets I love how the lorac Pro is I
think that they save you a lot of money
on packaging they make it super sleek
super easy to put a new kit to just have
on you I like either that type of
packaging or just really beautiful
packaging but still just like a simple
magnetic closure is enough for me I
don't need anything really else these
two or so examples are just super
annoying to me so the first ones are
from Urban Decay this is a Naked 2
palette we're all familiar with it this
just I just hate it like I hate this
metal packaging I hate how I feel like
when I shut it this one it's not doing
it but um I think it might have broke or
something I don't know I feel like when
I shut it it just like potentially could
crush all my shadows or like crack them
or something and it's just irritating to
me I just do not like this packaging at
all I just
I like the velvet one I know the velvet
one gets kind of dirty but the soft
clothes of it everything about that I
really enjoy and the other palette by
urban decay I don't have it anymore but
it's the Mariposa palette it was the one
with like in a metal tin with the
butterflies on it
if you own that palette you know what
I'm talking about it was impossible to
open like absolutely impossible to
freakin open that palette I eventually
depotted the shadows from that palette
and then I used that palette with like
magnets and put other depotted shadows
in that palette and I'm telling you
every time I tried to freaking open that
thing it was like I'm breaking my nails
off and potentially the spouts gonna fly
across the room and break everything
hated that palette this makeup forever
palette is an example of how easy a Tim
packaging could be it's secure so it's
not going to like open when you're
traveling or something but oh my gosh
like an old grandma could open this
packaging no problem that Mariposa
palette though like you know if you had
that palette it was horrible it was so
bad I hated that packaging so much and
then the other palette I'm kind of sad
to mention this because I love the
artwork on this palette I love the
concept behind the design and the
placement of the shadows on this palette
but I do not enjoy the packaging I
really don't this is the Kat Von D my
vida loca remix palette it came out for
holiday at 2015 and it just slides open
and there's no like safety features like
close it or anything like you could not
travel with this when I was showing it
in one of my more recent videos it was
just like constantly like trying to
slide out and I just feel like it's a
disaster waiting to happen like I'm just
so scared that this is going to fall out
and break and it's just such an
expensive palette the shadows are so
great I would just be so upset if
something happened to it so I don't know
I just I hate that it's so slide II the
anasazi of Beverly Hills lavish palette
is also similar packaging to this but
it's tighter so when you pull it out you
have to have a ribbon to pull it out and
it works the same way as this like it's
the same concept but I think it's just
executed better and I'm not going to
destroy it as easily so I don't know I
just I really wish that this was just
like her older packaging where you just
flip up the top instead of it being like
a sleeve in a case I just it's just
irritating to me and I'm just I really
just don't want to crush all these
beautiful eyeshadows I have a few more
left you things like four or so so I
will get into it I don't know if this
counts it's like a packaging flaw but
this is a bath and Bodyworks Wallflower
and these just burn out they burn out
all the time and it's irritating because
I don't want to constantly buy these I
have heard that people just return them
and you can
just continuously return them but I
really think they should last a good
amount of times like I think that they
should last at least a good six months
of constant use and I don't feel like
they do that's just something that's
annoying to me a pet peeve if you would
so yeah I just hate that
another packaging flaw is with any of
the products that have the stick kind of
app like I don't know dispenser I guess
you would call it and it's in like a
thicker product this one's not too bad
it's thinner but it's not as soon as
like a foundation and it's just
impossible to get all this out you
definitely have to have a little makeup
spatula to get every last drop out and
with something like this this is an
expensive product and you definitely
want to get your money's worth if you
want to get every last drop out of this
and so that's just irritating to me I
just wish it was a pump like I don't
understand why you couldn't have really
nice a classy pump on this and then you
could get all the product out the other
packaging that's very similar to this
one is the hourglass mineral veil in the
small size with it has the same kind of
like spatula that goes in it is like
impossible to get all of that conked out
again unless you have a spatula like a
makeup spatula that one is also very
expensive and it's just frustrating I
don't want to have to buy a specific
makeup spatula to try to get all my
money's worth out of a product like I
don't want to have to do that I wish
there was just an easier way that they
just changed the packaging so that it
was easier to get all the products out
because people want to use every last
drop of these products they're so
expensive I think this is the last
product that I have actually like
physically here to show you this is a
shampoo from pure ology this is the
strength cure and this product is so
liquidy it just doesn't work for its
packaging I don't know if you can see
that this it got this way because the
product is so liquidy and the hole is so
large that really I don't have to
squeeze it it just comes straight out
and you need the tiniest amount of this
they suggest that you use a dollop the
size of this emblem on the top here and
there's no way I can only get that much
product out with this packaging it just
is like a waterfall of craziness and
because this is such an expensive
product and because they've even told me
specifically
supposed to use that much about it's
frustrating that it's not possible to
only get that much out of here without
getting it crazy messy and trying to
like I'll put it back and it just I
definitely just think this is a really
big flaw in this packaging and I will
say the conditioner works completely
fine but that product is a thicker
product so I just think they should
close the hole on that a little bit so
that way
you actually have to squeeze to get your
product out instead of it just running
out to more products left one would be
the philosophy shower gels I hate the
packaging on those they are so hard to
squeeze out the product it's like a hand
workout hurts so bad I just think that
it's absolutely ridiculous that I'm even
that product is expensive it's like
twenty dollars for a big size of it and
it just hurts to squeeze it out I
definitely think they should like it
more malleable plastic or I have no idea
they just definitely need to figure that
crap out because I would like to get
every last drop out and I also don't
want to sit there squeezing it for like
ever to get all my product out it's fine
when you first start it but once you get
to the end and there's a lot of air in
the product it's so hard to squeeze and
it's super annoying to me last pet peeve
this is kind of just a overall general
annoyance with packaging but I hate when
shower products or anything you use in
the shower has a screw top lid like I'm
already in the shower I don't have time
and like just screw it off set it
somewhere use the product and then I
have it in my hand so either like set it
down while I scrub my body or whatever
I'm doing and then get the cap and screw
back on I cannot think of a product off
the top of my head that fits this but I
know that we've had it because me and
sample talked about it and we're like so
annoyed by it so I just think like
whether it's a face wash a body gel a
body scrub anything that you're gonna
use in the shower besides a tub
obviously how else would you get it out
but I mean anything that's in like
squeezed packaging but has a twist off
top is just like super annoying and such
an inconvenience when you're in the
shower really when you're anywhere but
especially in the shower it's just like
so annoying so oh I hope you guys
enjoyed this tag video I wasn't trying
to be too negative but I think we
I'll relate and sometimes it's just nice
to be like you're right oh my gosh yes I
totally know what you're talking about
if you guys want to do this tag
definitely do it I tagged every single
one of you or whoever wants to do it I
think this is just a fun one I think
this is like a really great tag for her
coming up with it on her own I think
that's amazing I I don't think I could
so I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
