line thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a palette
bingo if you haven't seen one of these
before I'm gonna leave the playlist but
I took this idea from Emily Noel where
you go to a palette today we're gonna be
doing the zodiac palette and you
randomly pick the colors you're gonna
use and you create an eye look with all
those colors you can include other
colors as well I guess I should address
the background I totally forgot sorry
guys I did switch out my background
because it's not Christmas anymore I
love the trees we all love the trees
I had a small funeral and it was sad but
I have any background this is gonna be
temporary because I'm working on getting
something up that I really really just
love like I think this is really pretty
don't get me wrong but having the
Christmas trees up I realized how
important and how much better I feel
when I film a video and I just love the
background and I feel like it just
radiates me I don't feel like I have to
try as hard it's just like yeah that
whole frame that's me baby so uh yeah I
have any background hopefully you guys
like it I think it's pretty cute I'll
link like the tapestry and the little
like neon heart down below if you want
to check those out if you were
interested in them anyway enough about
that I'm gonna leave Emily Noelle's
palette being go down below as well but
we're gonna get into the zodiac palette
excited if you haven't seen it before
this is what it looks like so I am
excited to see what color combinations
we get the whole outside row is shimmer
and then the insight is matte and then
there's like a highlight in the middle
I'm gonna start with Sagittarius being
one and then going around and then the
color under Sagittarius being the next
one around okay
so I use random dot work on my phone to
figure this out there are 26 colors
including the highlighter in the middle
I'm just gonna include it so let's pick
the first one I'm gonna pick four
different shades that I have to
incorporate into this look hopefully we
had something fun alright the first
number is 17 so let me figure that one
out so 17 is this matte color right here
it's the matte under leo and that's a
swatch of it's super pretty I have used
this color and my get ready with me that
I did with this look so you know well
we'll see what else we get next we have
D color 24 which is going to be another
matte and
is the color under Capricorn which is
this like this green really pretty okay
this reminds me of working at justice
we'd always have like every year a
purple and camo collection would come
out and so yeah that's whatever my team
you know it's like the girly camo all
right number 12 is this a shimmer shape
oh my gosh maybe it's the color
Capricorn oh my gosh this one right here
look we're getting a cohesive look y'all
oh that's it I know it's it's messy I'm
gonna go get wipes just not yet so that
is the color Capricorn okay if we get
black this would be like the best look
and last we have number 10 which is
gonna be another shimmer shade so let's
see this is 12 that means it's Pisces
bullet see it is Pisces and such a
pretty shimmer shade so we can do
something actually so wearable and so
beautiful with this look
I'm really excited these are colors I
probably wouldn't pair together that's
the fun of palette video you never know
what you're gonna get I'm gonna go get
away wash my hands we'll get started on
this look obviously I have my face done
already I'm gonna leave the products
listed down below if you're interested
but then we'll get into it and do
something fun I really got that purple
everywhere that purple stains a little
it's kind of disappointing alright so
let's get into this I do have to use
those four colors but I can use other
colors as well so I'm gonna go in with
the shade right under Aquarius just to
start a transition going I'm probably
gonna do the classic look with this
because I think it'll look pretty like
I'm filming other videos and sometimes
it's fun to actually make wearable looks
and not just you know more outrageous
looks I just think these shades are so
wonderful and beautiful for the price of
this palette you get so many beautiful
colors this is one I feel like I could
have as like an everyday palette because
it has such a nice mix of shimmery and
matte and colorful and neutral really
great I wish there was a matte cream
shade but like I can bring Berlin with
me somewhere even though
don't even own that but you know I'm
sure a lot of you guys do so next I'm
gonna go in with the color of Pisces and
I'm going to be putting out on a flat
shader brush and putting it on the inner
portion of my lid I'm only gonna go like
1/3 of the way in and then we're gonna
switch it to that army green shimmery
shade and then we're gonna put the matte
shade in the outer corner and then you
guessed it the purple will be the pop of
color on the lower lash line which I
think will be so fun
I did use a little bit of like a setting
spray to try to make sure this is as
like shimmery as possible and I'm
probably gonna just go end up going in
with my finger but we're just figuring
it up so I think I'm gonna try it this
way I'm putting it on the brush first
and then spring and then going in on my
lid a lot of you guys ask me which way I
do it and I usually spray the brush and
then go in I don't find it like ruins my
shadows in any way so that's just the
way I do it and that seemed to work
really well I might still eventually go
over with my finger but for the purposes
of right now where we're at with this
look that's working I would suggest
doing your eye makeup blast but I just
wanted to have my face done it's looking
a little crocodile a which I guess is
what metallic shadows look like now on
lens so we're gonna go on to the shade
Capricorn which is that army green so
pretty and we're going to be putting
that into the outer part of the eye and
kind of blending them into one another
this one was like so much more pigmented
whew so yeah just try to keep it on the
outer half and then I'm gonna go in with
my finger with Pisces and like tap out
in the middle it's a really pretty
combination I definitely could wear this
with that justice outfit you know like
glam camel i'm glamping that wasn't with
our shirts oh man
so weird to think about we're kind of
justice i know it's looking a little
rough just trust the process we're gonna
move on and we're gonna start blending
in
this have some blue on it but we're just
gonna move on I'm gonna start blending
in some of the brown we already used up
here and now I'm gonna go in with the
third color after use which is the matte
under Capricorn and we're gonna be
putting that into the outer crease and
kind of I don't know I usually go for a
cat eye shape I feel like it complements
my eye shape quite well but we're just
going to be blending that into the
corner
and I'm not trying to make it too dark I
just want to have a little bit more
depth because it's Matt instead of
shimmery which is reflecting more light
and I'm keeping it pretty low I don't
want to take the color too far I want
this to still be wearable and pretty but
just adding a little more color than
normal all right so I'm gonna go in with
my finger I'm gonna take Pisces and just
try to tap that into the green I'm also
gonna probably tap a little bit of
Capricorn the green shade too because I
really like the way it's looking
and then that Purple's gonna be like BAM
um you could also I think this would
look really pretty with orange I think
this would look really pretty with
basically all colors pink would look
really pretty too all right
I really like it so yeah I think we're
done with the top part of the eyeballs
sometimes it's hard out here to see if
like things are completely blended and
even so hopefully fingers crossed I
think it looks pretty good when I look
in the mirror all right so let's work on
the lower lashline I think that I'm just
gonna go straight in with this color
which is the one we're using right under
Leo and just start buffing that under
the eye you don't need a lot of this
color I want it to be kind of soft so
I'm applying it where I want it and then
buffing out from there and to blend that
out just a little bit more I'm gonna
take a duo fiber a little blending brush
like this can you see what it looks like
like that I'm gonna go in with this
pinky peach shade it's also matte and
just running that on the edges and just
really buffing it out even more I really
want to put this pink like in this inner
corner I'm gonna do it
I wasn't gonna do it because I know you
guys are probably tired of me always
doing it but it's just how I like to do
makeup it's my copper eye and nude lip
okay I'm just putting a little just like
a touch so I feel like it just kind of
ties that in a little more I don't know
I'm also gonna take more of the matte
Brown and just kind of feather that out
of there and into the crease a little
bit more and then with that
I'm gonna go in with the darker olive
color and just make sure it's just nice
and blended in okay cool I really like
that I'm gonna go in with the center
shade the highlighter and put that on my
inner corner so we have a pop and I'm
gonna be bringing it down the lower lash
line into the purple so I think that's
everything with the eyeshadows that
we're gonna do let's go in with some
liners I think it's really important
with this look specifically to add white
on the waterline because that purple can
potentially make you look sick I kind of
like a sick look sometimes but I don't
know I don't want it to take away like
people questioning if I'm sick or not
from this look specifically today I'm
also going to tightline with a brown
liner at the base of my lashes so that
way I can have some thickness when we go
in with mascara and then I am gonna go
in with mascara I'm just using the
number seven lash impact ultra and
putting a nice generous coat of mascara
on my eyes right mascaras on I have a
little bit to clean up over gonna leave
it for now and let it dry I think for
lips today I'm gonna go with this nude
this is from bare minerals and it's the
color juju I believe it's one of their
like matte liquid lipsticks I got this
indeed set thumbs out for the holidays
I'm gonna look pretty so I'm gonna put
that on my lips and then I think we'll
have the final look guys yeah so I think
I drew my lips on semi nicely so this is
the final look I hope you guys enjoyed
this palette bingo it was super fun
definitely a color combination I would
normally do with that like Navy oh I
don't want to call it any of you know
army green I think it still had a pop of
color but definitely could be neutral
and overall I just I still love this
palette I think it's really great so far
everything I've used from it I've really
enjoyed so that is everything let me
know what palette you want me to do next
for this series and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
