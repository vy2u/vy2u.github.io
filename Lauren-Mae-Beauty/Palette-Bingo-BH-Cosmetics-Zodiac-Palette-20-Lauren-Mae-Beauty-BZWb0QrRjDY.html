Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a palette
bingo and we are gonna be using the
Zodiac palette today I'm really excited
for this palette because it has a mix of
neutrals and really fun shimmers so I'm
excited to hopefully get into some
colors that I haven't used before I have
done a palette bingo with this palette
in the past I'm gonna leave that link
down below as well as the playlist cuz I
do these kind of regularly and I think
they're really fun so I think that's it
let's just get into the numbers I do
want to say that I am super stuffed up
right now I'm pre filming so many videos
I'm trying really hard so I can have
content up because by the time this
video goes up I will be in Italy so if
you want to follow me in real time
definitely check out my Instagram you're
probably hearing that a lot depending on
when this goes up so it's been difficult
because I got sick and then I got a job
and then I got sick again it's just yeah
so don't mind my voice is what I'm
trying to say cuz I cannot really
breathe out of my nose
alright so let's get to random calm
though let's actually get into this
video it's random org my bad but just so
you guys know with this video
I picked between four and five shadows
randomly to make an eye look and I can
use any shadows that I want but I have
to use the four or five shadows that I
actually pick so those I have to use but
I can incorporate other colors that's
how emily noel does her rules and i do
the same thing i'm gonna count the
center shade even though that's a
highlighter and we'll see how many
colors are in this palette there are 25
different shades so we're gonna put from
1 to 25 as the minimum and maximum i'm
gonna count the center shade as 1 this
is going to be 2 and we'll go all the
way around and then 3 will be the green
and we'll go all the way around just you
guys know all right so our first number
is number 20 so let's figure that out so
we got gemini which is the silver
metallic color that one's really pretty
and there's a swatch of it number 7 is
the next color we picked so and that is
this purple ooh that's what swatch of it
they're all the shadows in the center of
the palette are matte except for the
very center shade which is a highlighter
the next color we picked is number 6
which is going to be the one right
before it and that's going to be
this burgundy shade so it's a bit deeper
ooh this is like gonna be a really cool
look that's a swatch of it there for the
fourth color we got the number 18 so and
that is this pink shade which is called
leo and it's a really pretty like baby
icy pink so far everything's very cool
toned and I am gonna pick another color
since all of these are very like
monochromatic and I think we can handle
it so the last number is number nine and
that is this deep purple fate was on our
side wasn't it this time here are some
up-close swatches of the colors we have
very very monochromatic and very pretty
much cool tone I mean that one purple
and the burgundy can be a little bit
warm but I think overall these are gonna
look really good together I'm excited to
see the look that we're gonna create I'm
going to wipe off these swatches and
zoom in and we'll get started on the
look alright we're nice and zoomed in
and I think for today's look I'm gonna
do a halo eye in my video which I posted
yesterday in real time it was the items
I'm not surprised or on sale at Sephora
video I did kind of this purple halo eye
and since this is a lot of purple shades
I think I'm going to kind of use that
same technique but use these colors so
for everyone who is asking kind of how
to do that you can do this with this
palette or with any other colors that
you have and hopefully you guys can at
least get the technique from it I think
I'm actually gonna stick to just the
colors we picked because I got lucky so
we're gonna start off mmm actually no I
just lied to you I'm gonna go in with
this pink first just to build a slightly
lighter transition than that purple
first so I'm just going to lightly buff
this into the crease of the eye and
we're gonna make sure that we're really
getting it in the front part and in the
outer part since it's a halo eye and if
you have a darker skin tone than me you
might not need this step because I'm not
really using this for the color of it
I'm using it just so that way we have a
gradient into the lightest color I did
pick in math which is that purple I'm
not trying to really see much of this
pink but you could definitely just go
into that purple if it's a more mid-tone
on you know I think we have that built
up really nicely so I'm gonna go into
the first shade that we picked which is
this
purple here and I'm still using this
fluffy brush and I'm just gonna be
putting it slightly lower but basically
covering up that shade now this is not
going to be the same as my last look too
much when it comes to color these are
gonna be a lot more vibrant and I feel
like this is gonna even get a bit deeper
that one is just like a softer look but
technique wise you can do this and just
use like two different shades like a
lighter and a darker and then that pop
in the middle instead of using so many
to like build up the crease and stuff
when it comes to this palette I really
enjoyed I think it's so pretty
and I think the quality is so nice
especially I mean it's crazy I wouldn't
even expect it for the price it's just
good and right now I'm gonna go back
into the pink color we used and I'm
really gonna punch it in here because
with halo eyes you do want that inner
corner to have a lot of color just like
you want the outer corner - all right I
think it's looking really nice so far so
I'm gonna go into the burgundy shade and
this is gonna be the first color we're
gonna start using to build up the inner
and outer corner I'm using a small
crease brush from ELF
and we're just gonna be wiggling that on
the inner and outer corner and we're
gonna be leaving the inside blank so we
can put that pop of pink there it's so
funny too because I feel like with
palette bingos I use these to like go
out of my comfort zone when it comes to
colors and this one's like right up my
alley
this is something I would do without
palette bingo no sorry you guys always
get so many pink and purple looks and
sorry for my freaking voice I'm glad
though because I'm hoping that I'll be
completely over this by the time we
leave because I we leave in it's Sunday
today we leave in four days so I think
that I'll be like completely over it
which will be amazing this burgundy
shade is really playing nicely with
those purples and the pinks we already
laid down it's blending great I love
this palette and then we're also gonna
take this into the inner corner and you
want to be kind of careful you can even
go into a smaller brush I might in a
second but I just want to lay down some
color first and we're already building
up so much depth it's great and now that
we have the kind of second shade lay
down we're gonna go in with the deepest
shade that
we have and that is the dark purple that
we picked the last color and we're gonna
be building this up in the most inner
and outer corner and so we'll have like
a nice fade and this is going to be the
deepest area that's gonna really make
sure that that lightest center is going
to pop you need that contrast to make an
halo I really really look amazing and
I'm using a really small brush just so
that we have the most control over the
product that we're placing down I'm
gonna go back through with the elf brush
we just used and just kind of blend out
those areas to make sure there's not any
harsh lines or anything weird but
honestly I feel like these colors are
blending so nice into each other it's
kind of doing all the work for me for
now I'm gonna stop blending I'm gonna go
in with a glitter glue this is from NYX
and I'm putting this down so that the
pink shadow has a really nice sticky
base to stick to this has basically
become my routine now whenever I'm using
any shimmery shades just because if I'm
gonna take the time to put them on I
really want them to actually be there so
we're just going to be putting it in the
very middle so that way we can put that
product on and then blend it out and I
specifically suggest this step with this
palette because the outside sheets are
shimmer shades but they are baked and so
I find having something to stick to is
really going to make them look the best
so I'm going in with Leo and I'm just
going to be tapping that on the center
of the lid and I'm kind of going a
little bit farther out because we're
gonna go back in with that burgundy
shade which is that second deepest color
and really blend the edges and start
melting this look together and because
of how dark everything else is I feel
like this Leo shades almost looking like
a silver because there's so much depth
which is awesome so I'm gonna go back in
with that small little crease brush and
I'm gonna be taking that burgundy shade
where is it this one here it's actually
right above Leo and we're going to be
just tapping this on the outer edges I
mean we're not even really blending
because we want to keep that shimmer but
we're going to just make sure there's
more of a transition and you can kind of
like Pat down so it looks blended
essentially that's what I'm trying to
say and so I want you to take a look at
like see the difference here how this is
blended and this one isn't that's what
we want we don't you know this is just
harsher and harsher which it's not that
it looks bad I just think this idea
looks better this is looking so good I'm
so happy with this look so far I'm gonna
take the purple shade and that we went
in in the crease and the pink I'm gonna
like mix them together to kind of get an
in-between shade and I'm just going to
be putting this on the outer edge just
to blow it out a little bit more and
make sure we have that color and then
just to make sure it's deep I mean you
really don't even have to do this step
because I feel like everything looks so
blended and nice I'm gonna go in with
the darkest purple and I'm really gonna
make sure we have so much depth and then
again I'm blending out with the elf
brush it's so stunning and you know
something else with this palette is like
I don't have really any fallout at all
and it blended so easily it's crazy
we're the lower lash line today I kind
of want to do the same thing I did on
the top so that's what we're gonna do
we're gonna just mimic it so I'm first
gonna go in with a mix of the pink and
the purple on the lower lash line and
we're gonna run that through the whole
lower lash line actually we're gonna
just keep it on the inner and outer
corner and then bring whatever is left
over into the center next I'm taking the
tiny brush we used on the internet or
corner for the top of the lid and we're
gonna go in with the Burgundy first and
we're going to be keeping it the most on
the inner I mean outer and inner portion
of the eye and we're also going to be
keeping it closest to the lash line
whereas the other ones we kind of blend
it out I mean really very similar
techniques to the top lid and you
guessed it we're going in with the deep
purple and really keeping it outer
corner kind of blending it into the
other outer corner and then the very
inner corner by the tear duct and then
I'm taking the light pink shade and I'm
going on a smaller fluffy brush but I'm
just going to like blend all of that so
it looks more seamless and then to make
sure I get the pop I want on the lower
lash line I'm going in with the glitter
glue again I'm gonna be placing it right
in that center portion where we have the
least amount of color
and then I'm gonna pick up Leo on a
brush I'm using that same brush I
applied it with and I'm just going to
tap that over it I feel like that's not
nearly having the same like pop effect
so I'm gonna go in with the silver that
we picked and I'm gonna put that right
on top of it alright we're getting a
definite effect going on I look a little
a little sickly and it probably doesn't
sound great with my voice but overall I
think it looks pretty good right now I
just hope that everything's even we're
gonna move on to liners though I'm gonna
be putting white in the waterline this
is going to help open up my eyes because
I do have so much darkness on the inner
and outer corner and my eyes are kind of
small it's kind of closing it off but
the whites gonna help to kind of round
out this rounder eye shape when you do a
halo eye it really focuses on the center
of the eye and and gives you a more
rounded shape and so adding some white
to the waterline is also going to help
with that effect I'm also gonna go in
with black just on the upper tight line
and really smudge this in between my
lashes to build up a base since I'm not
gonna be putting any liner on and then
last before we go in with mascara I'm
gonna take a pencil brush I'm gonna
spray it down with a setting spray and
I'm gonna be putting the silver shade we
picked Gemini on the inner corner I know
I technically use this on the lower lash
line but that's not really where I was
intending to use it I was intending it
to be a pop of bright on the inner
corner I'm also gonna go over that with
the center shade just add yeah a bit
more brightness and I'm going in at that
little liner brush the detail line and
making sure that the purple is there
still and I'm blending out anything that
got over I really hope mascara is gonna
save this I feel like it looks pretty
but I don't know if I love the lash line
the lower lash line so we'll see once
mascaras on so I'm gonna be using this
one from Kiko it's the golden waves one
and I will be back to show you the final
look alright guys so here's the finished
look up close I really like the top of
the eye but I'm gonna zoom it out so you
can see the look in full and yeah we'll
finish up the video alright guys so
here's the final look zoomed out I
really enjoy this look I think the upper
lid looks so pretty I'm not sure how I
feel about the bottom lashline but I'm
glad I did something a little bit
and I normally do this is just such a
pretty palette I've really been wanting
to try just doing like two-toned looks
with this because how they have it
situated you have like a matte to go
with each shimmer and I think it'd be so
pretty just to like build up that color
and the shimmer and see what those looks
would be like so that was something I
was thinking about doing maybe I can do
it like in a kind of review video not
where I show you how I do it because
it'll be probably the same thing every
time but to show you what the looks look
like but anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this palette bingo let me know what you
guys think of the look and I will see
you in my next one thank you guys so so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
