Lauren I am still sick but we're gonna
keep filming I'm sorry I was looking
back at the last batch of videos I
filmed and my voice is pretty intense I
think it's still intense today but it's
mostly I'm just like stuffed up you know
but I feel a lot better so I'll stop
talking about that my gosh I'm sorry but
I am so excited for this video because
it's a collaboration and a palette bingo
which those are two awesome things so
today I am doing a palette bingo on the
Kat Von D new vida loca remix palette
and i'm doing this with LS she was
talking about this in one of her most
recent videos and then was kind of
talking about doing a palette bingo and
I was like we should do a collab because
I want to do a palette bingo on that too
so if you guys don't know how palette
bingo works you pick random colors to
create your eye look for the day and
we're gonna be choosing four random
colors from this absolutely beautiful
palette it's so pretty I'm really hoping
that I get some of these like pinky
orange colors cuz y'all know but we'll
see what I get
who knows there's basically I mean the
options are endless with this because
it's every color and what's amazing is
there's also a center portion with
neutrals I'm going to try to create my
entire look even with the colors I don't
pick from this palette today I haven't
used this in such a long time it's one
of my favorites but I keep it in my kit
just in case I need a colorful eyeshadow
so yeah I'm excited let's get to random
picking I use random more just to pick
it and so you guys know we decided to
have the color anthem be our number one
and then we'll go around clockwise and
then Strutter from the inside will be
the next color so let me count them up
there's 24 shadows possible in here so
yeah there's lots of options I'm really
excited about this one I just hope I get
good colors our first number is number
23 which I believe is this shade here I
will go around and count
really fast though to make sure yes I'm
correct I had to do a couple counting so
this is a matte cream shade but it is
more yellow tone so it's like a light
yellow and that's just watch of it
they're a great base shade I'm not I'm
not mad about it
I'm not mad because if I get only like
neutral colors I can do whatever I want
which I'll probably go to my go to next
I have number 19 which i think is also
in the inner portion of this ring so let
me count them out and I'll tell you what
that one is
so number 19 is this shape here which is
the other matte cream color actually
this has a tiny bit of shimmer it's like
a satin but it's basically matte so yeah
I literally literally though have picked
the two most boring shades in the
palette out of all of these colors
alright we have two more options here so
let's hope we get something good next in
number 7 finally okay so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
is this really dark green of course of
course the greens I filmed look with the
pastel goth palette with greens and oh
my it's a little scary but anyway so
that is the green color this is the
color lemming and let's pick one last
color next is number 22 which is also
gonna be on the inside and that is the
color no Bowl here so so those are the
colors that I picked really freakin
boring that as those boring palette
bingo that I've ever got in my life and
then the one color I did get I'm not
super happy about so yeah but we'll make
it work we're gonna do something fun I'm
gonna try to incorporate that but also
try to do something more fun you know
because those shades are kind of boring
first I'm going to use the color molder
which is the first color I picked it's
that matte cream but with more yellow in
it I'm going to be putting this all over
the eyelid just to set down I've already
primed but I like to just give my eyes a
nice base seriously I feel like I need
to do a different palette bingo
that's because it's crazy that those are
the colors I got right with the freak
next I'm gonna go in with noble I'm
happy that this was the matte brown
shade that I got because it is the
warmer toned one I'm just gonna do a
light crease color I'm using my Sigma
e-40 just above a little as a transition
I think I'm gonna be putting that dark
green on the lower lash line I've done a
look similar to that before and I just
felt like it looked really pretty I have
things to do today
and again although I want to be fun I
also I do want this to be more wearable
so I'm gonna play around though with
either some of the pinks or the oranges
with that green on the lower lash line
and I didn't mention this in my intro
but please go check out Elle's videos
obviously I mean I've mentioned her on
my channel multiple time so I feel like
a lot of you guys know who she is she
will obviously be linked down below in
the description box go check out her
videos definitely go check out her
palette bingo if you like palette bingos
you will enjoy it because this is a fun
palette and I'm excited to see what she
picked because I can almost bet you it
will be more fun than the colors that I
got we have a little bit of a base built
up which is great I'm gonna go into the
color analog which is this orange color
I'm just gonna kind of add some warmth
to the eye I kind of have an idea of how
this is gonna go I'm gonna be using this
orange kind of as my outer corner color
I might switch up the brush in a second
but we'll just at least get a base down
the green is gonna go in the lash line
but pretty thick and I'm gonna blend it
out with probably one of these colors so
the green really pops and then I'm going
to be doing my classic pink in the brows
I think that will be pretty I also want
to make sure I get just a light wash of
the orange up here I really been liking
the way that like a warm orange blends
into the pink so I'm just kind of gently
blending a bit of that there I don't
want it to be like the most intense the
most intense orange I want on this outer
portion
I'm going to be switching up my brush
now I'm going in not with that one wrong
brush I'm going in with this colour-pop
blending brush I really like this brush
if you're on the website and you're
deciding if you want to get some of the
brushes I love this one and I also love
the flat shader one I think they work
really well and I've used them in the
colour-pop shadows as well as the like
regular shadows I use them all the time
woohoo it's looking pretty I was
thinking about doing I'm gonna just do a
little bit of a chatty thing right now
but I was thinking about doing a color
pop like somehow like a series or a
situation where I try to use my color
pop shadows kind of like a palette bingo
but I don't know I'm just wondering what
you guys think or what you think it
could be called or I don't know if you
have any ideas it's just like a
fledgling idea at the moment but I
really would like to get more use out of
them I think they're really nice but I
just tend to reach for palettes or my
single shadows in my Z palettes so let
me know what you guys think about that
or if you have any ideas of how that
could be like an actual idea instead of
a half idea I really do love orange on
the under corner
so next I'm gonna go in with another
shade that I have to use and that is the
color lyric that is the kind of like
satin more white cream shade and I'm
gonna be putting that on the inner
portion of the eye and just brightening
up that inner portion this is really
similar honestly to the looks I've been
doing recently I've just really been
into almost all matte looks I think they
I don't know I'm just into it right now
but I still have that like light bright
color so it's okay that it's not
shimmery I'm probably gonna go in a
little later to even make that orange
pop up even more but for now that is
pretty dang good I'm gonna start working
on the pink color so I'm gonna be taking
this matte pink up here and putting this
into my brow area it's weird to use a
different pink than savage but I feel
like this one's very very comparable to
that one maybe not quite as neon but
still nice and bright and I'm just
blending this into the
part of the brow and I like to kind of
like fade off this way so that I can
have my brow bone highlight but another
thing I wanted to mention in this video
I feel like I'm almost out of frame
because I'm like bending down sorry um
another thing I wanted to mention in
this video is that thank you so much to
everyone who left a comment on my last
tube talk I'll be filming another one
today but I really appreciate that I was
a little nervous to film that video but
I'm really trying to push myself to just
not be nervous and like not really care
about stuff and I I tend to realize
Jacqueline said something in one of her
recent videos and I totally agree that
the videos you're the most nervous about
I feel like are the ones that you're the
most happy with and people honestly love
the most and have a really good response
so if there's a video out there that
you're kind of nervous about doing I
suggest doing it because I've only been
happy with all of the videos I felt the
most nervous on but I wanted to say
thank you for all your comments thank
you to everyone who left their opinion
there really were like opinions across
the spectrum of that whole Z palette
issue and I really you know I liked that
we can all feel comfortable saying our
opinions and where we stood on it and
they didn't have to get to an ugly place
everyone was really simple and nice and
yeah and it wasn't all the same opinions
so I do really appreciate that and I'm
glad that we can do have my channel it's
something that I'm really happy and
passionate about having on my channel
just open dialog me being myself a
hundred percent and not feeling like I
need to hide things from you or that I'm
gonna let you down it's like I'm just a
frickin human and that's how I feel and
you guys are the same way and you guys
are always so like accepting and nice to
me I feel like there's a lot of like
YouTube hate but I I don't really don't
I don't get it sometimes I like prepare
myself for the hate and then it never
come so thank you for that I like where
the pink is right now I'm gonna go back
in with the orange like I said I might
do with that same color pop brush and
just kind of intensify it and I have
been like
lately but more like liming yellowy
greens so I might do something like that
on the inner corner to this is basically
palette bingo that's turned into my
everyday I feel like plus a lower lash
line of green and I'm gonna take a
little bit of this and just kind of
blend it into the base of that pink just
so there's a little bit of a start I'm
excited I'm going to a little NARS
makeup demo today on Melrose so that'll
be fun I'm hoping I've never really done
a workshop type of thing like that so
I'm excited to just see what that's
about and watch the people do some
makeup should be fun before we move on
to the lower lash line I'm gonna take
some of that lyric again and put that
under the brow bone this has a bit of a
shine to it so it'll be a nice contrast
to all the mattes we're using but it
won't leave me too like frosty and just
make sure everything's blended I'm just
gonna go over with our original brush
and blend out anything I think might
need blending I'm gonna be using the
colored stash from Urban Decay as my
tight line liner and my lower lash line
liner this is a green so it kind of
works out I will also be putting a white
liner in my waterline and I'll be back
and while that liner is still movable
I'm just gonna kind of smudge it with my
finger that's what I do next I'm going
to be taking a smudge brush and I'm
gonna go in with Lenny so this is the
fourth and final color I have to use on
the look I'm gonna be smudging this as
close to the lash line as possible and
then we can go out and kind of like
blend it out in a little bit I'm really
keeping it on the outer half though
because I will be bringing in those
other light greens and this is quite
dark although it's green it's dark and
that's I don't want it to close my eye
off now I'm going to take this elf brush
and I'm gonna go in with the color vinyl
and this is just a really pretty lime
green I'm gonna go under that color and
just kind of smudge that color out I
really want to just make sure that the
green is what's popping not the darkness
if that makes sense
because that's what I I'm fine with the
color I just don't want the darkness and
I'm gonna bring this lighter green in
a little bit more as well to the inner
corner and I'm just gonna go back in and
make sure that the lash line is pretty
dark on the outer corner with that lemon
color I think I'm gonna blend even more
I don't know I want this green to pop
even more I feel pretty good about that
I'm gonna go in with the color skull or
skulls multiple skulls not just one and
I'm gonna put this on my inner corner to
highlight this is like a stark white
shimmery shade I was gonna do something
more but I really feel like these colors
are starting to get a little intense and
I don't want to make the look seem like
almost comical do you know how that can
get like if you used too much color it
can almost look instead of looking like
refined it starts looking like too crazy
I try to stay away from that as much as
possible like edit myself so I'm gonna
add some mascara and we will see how
this look like finished look looks I
really like it I just wish that favorite
colors I had to use from the palette but
alright I'll be back okay this is the
final look I'm really happy with it
actually I like the way the green looks
I feel very tropical and I'm about to
film a like summer sense like my
favorite summer products that have great
summer scents something like that video
so I feel like this look is very festive
for that the green is something
unexpected and I'm glad I could kind of
transform it with the lighter green from
the palette so overall I'm really happy
with the look that came out um it's just
a little disappointing in the Bingo
aspect of the the portion of this video
so let me know down below if you think I
should do Amy vida loca remix like 2.0
version of this to see what my second
options would be if I did this again
also definitely and again check out Elle
and say hi teller a since you're over
there and I'm excited to see her look
still so that's everything for this
video guys thanks so much for watching I
hope you have a great rest of your day
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
