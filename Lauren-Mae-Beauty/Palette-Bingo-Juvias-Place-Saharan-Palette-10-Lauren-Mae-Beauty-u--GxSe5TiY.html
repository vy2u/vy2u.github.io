Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a palette
bingo I haven't done one of these in a
little bit and today I have the full
bead on I have like so much powder on my
face I definitely went more full
coverage I tried to go a little bit more
glam instaglam so I wanted to use the
dubious place - Heron palette I have
used this and I do love it but I just
wish that I busted it out more this to
me is like a really nice everyday type
of palette so I don't know why I'm not
reaching for it or a day so that being
said palette bingo is something that I
took from Emily Noelle so I'll leave her
channel link down below and I feel like
a lot of people do this now too so I'm
gonna leave some people and their videos
linked down below so you can check them
out I know Stacy does like a different
type of take on this like a pallet
gauntlet type of thing so everyone kind
of has changed the rules to how they
want to make it happen and I kind of
have as well so how I like to do this is
I know palette bingo bingo stands for
five shades I might pick five sheets
because these are neutral but depending
on the palette I pick I decide how many
shades I'm gonna pick randomly just
because my goal for this is just to
inspire myself with colors I might not
have chosen myself but I still want to
create a pretty look I'm not trying to
just make this an insane challenge like
that's just not what I want from it I
still want to create something beautiful
and pretty I just want to be inspired by
different colors then I would maybe
naturally pair together that being said
let's just get into it so I'm gonna go
on random gorg and pick my five shades
I'm gonna do five shades on this one and
this palette isn't that big so I'm not
sure like how different this look is
gonna be out of other looks and in my
palette because I allow myself to pull
from other shades I just have to use at
least the five shades I do pick soap
anyway let's pick out of the twelve so
the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 2
all right so my first number that I
picked is number 2 I'm so happy that
means it's this one this is like my
favorite shade in the whole palette this
is the color wood Dobby maybe is how you
say it it's absolutely stunning I love
it I love it with all my heart
ok next color we got 2 again ok get it
together number 10 is the next color and
that is
shade Katsina it's a really beautiful
tan I already love this color but I
would pick this out naturally so maybe
we'll get something that will stump us a
little number 5 is the shade
Zoya and that's soya and then we have
two more I was gonna be like only one
more because I usually pick four but I
think five will make this a little bit
more fun next is number nine which is
going to be the black shade here and
this is a matte black and we got number
ten again and now we got number four
which is the shade Kia this one here
it's funny because I feel like the look
I did last with the covergirl palette
which I don't know when you will see
that was using basically an exact shade
like that okay so that is my color
palette that I have to work with I'm
excited to try to do something with that
I kind of you know want to keep it
bright though so we'll see how I work in
that black and that last shade we just
spent oh I just grabbed like oh my god I
just had so many chills I just grabbed a
dry wet wipe or you know makeup wipe and
I wasn't expecting the texture of it so
it like really freaked me out anyway
okay so I'm gonna zoom aside and we'll
get started I'm pretty zoomed in so
don't mind if I'm a little bit more
k-cup than makeup today but I'm gonna go
in with Kat Zeena naturally as my
transition it is a matte like warm toned
Brown it's perfect for it I still don't
really know how I want to do this I
think I'm gonna keep the lighter colors
on the lid and then do the darker ones
on the bottom I know that might not be
as fun but this one for me this palette
bingo I just I wanted to do a palette
bingo but I didn't want it to be just
crazy for the sake of being crazy not
today I feel like I do a lot of colorful
looks and that's fun and I enjoy it but
today I kind of wanted to do something a
little bit more I guess natural I don't
know what the word is I think I decided
what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna be using
the green all over the lid this one I'm
gonna put this in the outer corner
that's gonna go no this one's gonna go
in the inner corner and the black is
gonna be like a smudgy liner on the top
so I'm gonna keep it still really green
and fun
I am excited it's gonna be pretty much a
really green eye I might use some of
that black also in the outer corner with
the darker green I need a setting spray
so I'm gonna go get one I went and got
some glitter glue as well as some
setting spray so I'm gonna be using that
and putting that on my lid now so I'm
taking the NYX glitter primer or
whatever they call it and I'm gonna be
putting that on the entire mobile lid I
just want something really nice and
tacky for that shade to stick to because
I really want it to look in tense I mean
it's super intense by itself but I
really want to make sure man we are
zoomed in close I hope I look decent
that's how you know it's good look at
that when your finger starts picking up
your outlet I'm gonna be taking this
really small detail brush I've really
been enjoying this one because it's so
tiny I'm gonna spray it and then go into
my palette and we're picking up that
lime green this is just such a stunning
color it's so vibrant and beautiful
all right and that's what it looks like
so far I'm going to do that to the other
eye
and now I'm going to take the same brush
I'm going to go into the darker green
and we're just going to be putting that
on the outer portion of the eye I am
getting a little bit of fallout but I'm
not gonna worry about that right now I
can clean that up later and I'm not
really wetting my brush anymore I'm just
using whatever was wet on it originally
now that I have that place down I'm
gonna go into the blending shade we use
and I'm just going to make sure we have
a good amount of that color on this
outer edge because I'm gonna go in with
the black next and I want to be able to
blend it out honestly I'm just gonna go
back in with a small brush to add the
black which is called Chad and I'm just
going to be barely adding that on the
outer corner because I'm gonna blend it
out and for blending that I'm taking a
really like a smaller blending brush and
just going right and working right in
that area just blending it out
and I'm just gonna keep going back and
forth between the black and blending out
until I get a depth that I really like I
feel like this block didn't look like
it's watched well but I feel like it's
going on the I really really well I'm
going back into the big fluffy brush we
originally use and just making sure the
edges are nice and blended and just
using really light pressure so we don't
really move stuff too much I just want
to see that Brown peeking through it's
just so cool I really like this look so
far okay so now to really enhance those
colors we used on the lid I'm gonna go
back in with the setting spray and just
really revamp in you know that weird
revamp it we're gonna put these colors
back down on to the lid and just make
sure there's still just as shiny and
beautiful as they were when we first put
them down and I'm starting with the dark
and then I'm gonna move into the lighter
green I'm using the other end of this
what is this called
Urban Decay brush to really pack on that
green again and I'm just kind of patting
it into the darker green to try to get
the best blend that we can but if I had
to pick I do want more of the lime green
than the darker green I am so obsessed
and I'm just gonna just to freakin
finish it off I'm going in with my
finger on the very inner portion that's
what I'm talking about
look so pretty I don't do like cut
creases but I feel like this is like the
closest I get to like a more precise eye
I've really been feeling the greens
lately I feel like so many of my looks
have been super green and I've been so
into it so I'm going to leave it there
and I'm going to brush away the fallout
under my eye and hope that we good and
it looks good to me I think because I
did set so heavily with powder before
there just wasn't a lot of moisture for
that shadow to really stick to so let's
work on the under eye I kinda just want
to mimic what's going on on the top on
the bottom so we're gonna go in with
that matte brown shade this one here and
I'm gonna be putting that under
I and really focusing it on the outer
corner
I kinda want to stop there for now and
just kind of see where we're at with the
inner corner so I'm gonna work on that
for the inner corner I'm going to also
wet my brush and I'm going to just buff
on that lighter shade which is called
soya it's really beautiful like rose
gold and we're gonna buff that on the
inner corner of the eye and I think I
really want to bring this down as kind
of like a fun color into that Brown I'm
gonna take my small little brush I'm
gonna go into the dark green shade and
I'm just going to buff some color
underneath the lash line just a little I
don't want too much but I do want to
connect it up into the upper eyelid and
you know what and because I'm just gonna
mimic the top I'm gonna go in and spray
my brush and put that green also on the
kind of middle portion of the eye right
here
and then I think I was gonna not but I'm
gonna bring in one color that wasn't on
here and I'm gonna bring in this shade
here it's called Sokoto and I'm going to
just just a little guys I couldn't not
come on
I think it'll complement that rose gold
I barely tapped my brush into I wasn't
expecting it to be this intense I really
love how this turned out I'm gonna go in
with some liners I'm gonna put some
black on my tight line white on my
waterline I'm also gonna put some
mascara on my lashes and then we'll come
back we'll do a lip and I'll show you
the final look alright guys so this is
the eyes all done I'm obsessed with them
I will say the red was a little bit more
intense and I thought but I still love
the look it just definitely kind of
takes it a step farther but either way
if you did it without it it would be
beautiful I do like it with it it just
does something a little bit different
it's like red and green but not
Christmas so it works I love it her lips
I was like not sure what to do honestly
I like kind of just like what I have
going on but I'm trying not to be so
basic I think I'm gonna go in with this
liner from bite this is the shade 20 to
20 and then I think I'm just gonna use
the Revlon plumping lip cream in the
shade barely blush and that is a final
look guys I really hope you enjoyed this
palette bingo I know it was a little bit
different and maybe not as adventurous
as my other ones but I feel like the
look turned out a lot better than when I
just go in and just I don't know when
it's a palette and I don't know I like
the way this one turned out I guess it's
like this is a color combo I would maybe
do but wouldn't maybe have the push to
do it so I really like the way this
turned out let me know what you want me
to do next I know I need to do the
electric palette again that's on my list
I just I was gonna do it tonight but I
was like I don't want to put like dark
blue and dark purple on my eyes today so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed anyway and
I will see you in the next video bye
