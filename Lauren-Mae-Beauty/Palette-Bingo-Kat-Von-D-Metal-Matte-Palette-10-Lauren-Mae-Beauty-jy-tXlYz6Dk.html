Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a palette
bingo I wanted to do a palette bingo on
the metal mat today because this is a
palette that I put in a regrets video
and I never use ever ever ever never
ever I think it's beautiful it's massive
I don't have a problem with the quality
of these shadows I just don't feel super
inspired it has these beautiful blues in
it which I think are great I just don't
usually go super blue so we're gonna see
what the fates allow for me to do an
eyeshadow look today I think I'm gonna
pick four different colors I have some
other palette bingos on my channel if
you haven't seen him I'm gonna leave
those linked I got this idea from Emily
Noelle but so many people are doing them
now I feel like it's kind of becoming
like a more just like established thing
kind of like anti hauls or something I
don't know maybe it's not that big yet
but you know I'm hoping I also already
have the rest of my face down I'm sure
you guys can tell I'm going to
random.org and let's see what we get
so number 21 would be this one here
which is bone hard one guys I'm already
starting off with just like how am I
gonna do this alright so it's just a
cream shade that one's pretty easy
number eight is next a nice Brown I
swear all of my palette bingos I get the
freaking most basic colors this is the
shade synergy it's beautiful
like I'm excited but it's definitely not
colorful number fourteen is next and
that's this green shade here really
pretty well that's the shade Moss and I
think that's gonna be really beautiful
with that bronze this is kind of similar
to the zodiac palette which is the last
palette bingo I did it was kind of like
these mousy colors too and then last we
have number 15 which is right next to it
and it's this purple right there that's
the shade ribbon and it's a dark matte
purple so
that's the color palette that we're
gonna work with today I'm not gonna pick
another color because I don't want to
get like something random but I think we
can do something fun I'm gonna do a
little bit of something basic but I
think it'll be nice and wearable and
hopefully we'll do this again with it
another time and hopefully we'll get
some of like the pretty shimmer shades
so I'm gonna go in with the shade bone
and just my e-40 I'm gonna be blending
that onto the lid and I forgot to zoom
us in but after I apply this to my base
this is just setting down my primer I
will zoom us in why hello there okay so
we're zoomed in really really close next
I'm gonna go in with the shade suede
which is a light brown I'm gonna use
that same Yves 40 brush and we're gonna
be blending that just to start a
transition I'm gonna be putting the
really pretty bronze shade on the top
lid and have that purple kind of
blending it out that purple shade though
is pretty intense so we'll have to use
the other purple in here to really get a
nice blend
I'm gonna be taking basically the same a
40 brush this one's just a little bit
wider I'm gonna take these shades silk
and we're gonna start making hate purple
transition we're going to be layering
this on top of the suede color and just
introducing some of that purple so it's
not superstar once we add in the other
color I feel like these colors are
blending out even better than I remember
which is really nice
hopefully this will you know get this
palette back out in my drawers because
it is so pretty I just never would reach
for it on the daily and because I can't
help myself I'm gonna go in with this
shape here this is fringe and I'm just
going to be blending this in this top
front portion same brush I don't switch
my brushes a ton I'm not like bringing
it too far into the brow I'm just kind
of adding this warmth here because I
like it and then I'm going back in with
the originally 40 and I'm going to blend
through the edges and make sure that
they look good I really like the way
that looks so we're gonna go into
synergy focus it and I'm going to be
using my finger and put this all over
the lid I mean the entire portion of the
movable island
I really like the way that looks so I'm
gonna take a smaller kind of blending
brush I tend to use Ecotools 1 a lot but
you can use whatever you have I'm gonna
go in with ribbon and I'm going to be
just buffing that into the outer corner
just to add some depth and just bring
that purple in again
we're gonna go in with the lighter
purple shade and just blend out the
edges of this
and then I am going to go in with that
bone shade again and I'm just gonna kind
of clean up this portion sweep away any
product but try to kind of like clean up
I maybe did a little bit too much I'll
look at extra highlighted for liner
today I'm going to keep it really simple
I'm going in with white on the bottom of
my lashes I'm going to put this in the
waterline as well as just kind of drag
it under so that way I can have
something to blend the green on top
because that is what we're gonna do
we're just gonna buff the green all on
the lower lash line
so for moss we're going in with a pencil
brush and we're gonna see what this
looks like kind of I mean I guess kind
of heavily on the lower lash line
and
I like the way that looks I'm gonna go
in and just add a little purple it's
looking like the tiniest bit like patchy
or something over here there we go
easy fix okay so I really really like
the way that this is looking I really
want to add this gold in I don't know if
I want to like tap it on the center of
the lid and just add a tiny shine or if
I want to like put it on the inner
corner I'm gonna tap it first just on
the highest part of the eyelid just add
a little bit of dimension so next I
think that's it for eyeshadows actually
I think I'm gonna try putting this gold
on the inner part of my lid this is from
Sephora and house of lashes I picked
this up on sale for like $18 for three
of them so I'm gonna just put this on
the inner part and I'm gonna drag it
down a little and I want to blend this
as I add it because these do drive
I feel like the idea of this was a lot
prettier than it actually is turning out
so I'll probably go in with that gold
shade on top of this
I think I know it happened it's that the
green guy on the pencil brush when I
blended it out so be very careful I'm
going on with the shade flash which is
the gold that we put on the center of
the lid and I'm just going to be kind of
tapping that over that liner
all right I really like the gold I'm
really happy I did that I was like
wanting to with and I just chickening
out a little it looks really like puppy
fall colors I don't know why - I'm like
thinking I'm like Versace I think last
is to go in with the mascara so I'm
going to put on the roller lash my
benefit and then I will zoom out and put
a lip on and I'll show you guys final
look all right so my mascara is on today
I'm gonna go with this lip pencil from
bite this is the one you get for your
birthday in Colossae I thought this
would be nice because I feel like my
look is pretty cool tone except for that
pop of gold so I'm gonna take off my lip
balm really classy like
alright guys and that's the final look I
really hope you enjoyed this pallet
bingo I'm really happy I decided to bust
his palate out I feel a little bit more
inspired than I was to use this but
definitely something that I've learned
is that although these colors look a
little bit brighter in the palette they
definitely don't show up that way on the
eye like you need a lighter brighter
shade to really like buff out with to
enhance the like actual color coming out
or they just kind of turned dark at
least on me so I'm excited though I'm
excited to maybe have a renewed love for
this I actually really enjoyed the way
the look turned out it's definitely not
something I would have done if it wasn't
for palette being go so I'm really happy
it made me go out of my comfort zone and
do something a little bit different pair
some colors together that are different
and more than anything I'm really glad I
added in the pop of gold it just adds
something extra and something glam I
feel like just Medusa II or something
maybe the green and the gold and the
purple I don't know but that is
everything thank you so much for
watching guys I'm not sure what I want
to do palette bingo on next but I will
have one of these up hopefully soon I've
been trying to do more tutorials I feel
like you guys are enjoying it and I'm
enjoying the ones I've done so thank you
so much for watching guys and I'll see
you my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
