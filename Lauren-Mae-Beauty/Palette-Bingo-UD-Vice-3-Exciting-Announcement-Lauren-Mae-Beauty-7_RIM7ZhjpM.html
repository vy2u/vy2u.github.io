that's learned thanks so much for
watching I'm so excited today because we
are gonna be doing another palette bingo
I have done two other palette bingos on
my channel I'll leave a link to down
below in the playlist but we're gonna be
working with the vice 3 palette today
this super shiny guy this is what it
looks like inside if you haven't seen a
palette bingo video before these were
started by Emily Noelle I'll leave her
link down below but you randomly pick
through I think we do five shades four
shades I can't remember I think I might
just pick four but pick four shades you
have to use in your eye look you can
include other shades if you want to to
kind of like make everything work but
it's just a fun way to explore your
palettes and kind of get creative with
your makeup in a way that you probably
wouldn't otherwise so I'm super into
that I think that's really fun I'm gonna
pull up random.org on my phone and we're
gonna pick some numbers that correlate
with the shadows and pick the color her
name's there are 20 shadows in that
palette so I'm gonna have my minimum v1
my maximum be 20 let's do 4 random
colors because I'll probably add
something in I think I might have done 5
in the past but I think I'm just gonna
do four the first one is number 9 this
is like 1 going across so 5 6 7 8 and 9
I love it this one here is called
alchemy and it's a really pretty
burgundy color it kind of matches my
hair a little bit not as pink and got to
swatch of it there the next number is 12
and that is the blue shade right here
and this one's called heroine those are
the two swatches so far I'm kind of glad
I only picked four shades next is number
eight oh my gosh I feel like this is
very patriotic number eight is the shade
lucky which is a really pretty coppery
gold color and that is it there I'm like
going to a show tonight too so and last
we have number sixteen and number 16 in
the palette is gonna be this one here
which is DTF it's like a cool toned
matte color so that's my palette I'm
working with definitely interesting I'm
not like crazy excited about it but
we'll make something work I'm going to
try to make it a little bit more
wearable than maybe I normally
would because I am planning on like
going out tonight and I don't want to
look too crazy I still want to feel
pretty so the first thing I'm gonna do
is actually use a shade that I didn't
pick which is this one here this is
called truth and I'm just gonna be
setting my eyelid I did already
previously set it but I'm just going to
kind of make sure that base is nice and
smooth and ready for new shadows to be
applied on top of it this might be a
little bit more of a chatty palette
bingo just because I wasn't gonna film
today but I am so excited I just found
out some really awesome news and I
wanted to share it with you guys because
you guys are like my besties and I'm so
excited about it and I just like sharing
my I don't know
you know like successes with you guys so
let's move on to the next step so while
I'm blending we can talk I'm gonna go in
with this matte shade this is gonna be
like our crease color I'm probably gonna
go really light with this cuz you know
actually I'm not gonna go in with that
one first I'm gonna go in with the one
right above it which is undone I'm gonna
put that in my crease first and we'll
build up to the DTF color so the really
amazing news if you don't follow me on
Instagram you should because I did post
about it there it's always link down
below in case you want to follow me like
it's fun over there it's kind of a mix
in my personal life and makeup and
youtube and everything so if you guys
don't know I am a makeup artist that's
what I do like that's I make my living
and I've been lucky enough to be on a
couple of different shows I've been I've
worked on the show botched because my
basically like manager slash mentor and
I don't know the person Isis to makeup
artist I says she's been working on
botched in Vanderpump so I've been lucky
enough to you know work on those shows
and it's been really awesome so last
year I had the opportunity to work on a
new show and this was the first time I
kind of I got the gig through her and
because of her but I was working on it
like my own makeup artist and not as
like her assistant like she was working
on other shows she was so busy and it's
finally gonna air on e I'm so excited
I'm mostly working reality TV I know
that's not everyone's cup of tea but it
is sure my cup of tea now I mean I'm
always down for a little fun drama but
now that I work in it I'm like everyone
needs to watch reality TV it's the best
the show I worked on is called second
wife's Club and it's going to be
premiering May 4th on E I'm so so
excited to like finally share that with

it's on e's website i'm gonna link their
website down below and like the trailer
so you guys can see what the shows about
and i'm just so incredibly excited this
is like my first really really really
really big thing for like my career and
um like for what I've been working on
and I'm just excited to be able to share
that with you guys
so how this show work there's six ladies
on the show I believe let me think
yeah there's six ladies on the show I
mostly worked with Katie she was like
the person that I always did her makeup
like no matter what I always do Katie's
makeup once I started working on the
show because we just really clicked and
she really liked the way I did her
makeup so for the show when they're like
doing actual interview like talking
about what's happening that's what I did
and then make it for for the most part I
was on set for different days too but
anyway okay I don't even know I'm like
so all over the place cuz I'm just so
excited
but anyway I'm mostly doing her makeup
and Shauna's makeup I also did Marissa's
makeup but the other ladies on the show
actually had their own like glam squads
and I was part of like production this
glam squad if that makes sense
but it's so excited I'm so excited to
see everyone on the show and like see
all the drama and just how everything
pans out and I hope you guys will watch
it too I'm probably gonna be posting
about it because I'm hella excited about
it on my Instagram so just be ready for
that but yeah like how exciting is that
that is just crazy I can't believe that
I am gonna see my work like on TV that's
so so incredibly cool so I just wanted
to share that with you guys are so
excited
don't know how much I can share I kind
of want the show to like you know play
out before I talk about anything too
much and I want it I mean I don't know
what all happened because I just did the
makeup for interview you know what I
mean so anyway I'm super excited I'm
gonna link Sean and um Katy's instagrams
down below too if you want to like
follow them and like be a part of it
I don't know sometimes I like doing that
like doing like I'm a part of it I'm
just so excited so what's on my eyes
right now that I kind of blend it into
the crease is a mix of these two so I
have one shadow down that I've actually
used so far which is awesome cuz this is
kind of a hard look let's move on and
I'll continue talking next I'm gonna go
in with the shade lucky here and that's
gonna be my main lid color I think
you're putting the golden bronzer shade
on the lid is like the most wearable and
I'm just using a flat synthetic shader
brush I'm gonna build that up on the lid
so it's the most intense let me know I'm
gonna try not to ramble too much because
I mean I've said I've said everything I
need to say about the dates and all the
stuff but I'm just so frickin excited
like that's so insane I can't believe
that honestly I wasn't expecting to ever
work as a makeup artist when I went to
school I wanted to go to learn how to do
makeup but my number one goal and still
my number one goal is to have my own
cosmetics line like that's what I want
to do and like that's my passion passion
so to be working on something so legit
so fresh out of school I graduated a
year ago in February is really
incredible you know and I just feel so
blessed and I just I feel very thankful
and grateful to Michelle who is it was
given me so many opportunities and I'll
have her link down below to like in case
you just want to like to check
everything out but I just feel so
incredibly like grateful to her and I'm
just so excited I'm so excited for what
the future has to hold and I will have
like another big announcement coming
soon after this one because a different
show that I helped assist on is going to
be airing also on E
like only a couple of weeks after that
one team Michele cube Beauty taken over
the e Network and that's so exciting
let me know down below what your
favorite like reality TV like show is I
just wonder what you guys watch because
I don't technically have TV right now I
just do like Netflix but I will be
getting cable so that I can be watching
these shows that's good for now we're
gonna have to go back and retouch that
up anyway I'm gonna put a little bit of
this color and sweep out any fallout I
might have gotten I'm going in with my
color pop blending brush and I'm gonna
be taking the color alchemy and we're
going to be putting that in the outer
corner of the eye I just wonder what
Grace's favorite shows are I know a lot
of people really like Vanderpump rules
which i think is on Bravo not E and I
just you know wonder what you guys like
to watch I don't know what else to talk
about like literally that's what I was
like so excited to tell you guys about I
just saw on Shauna's Instagram that's
why I'm like oh my gosh I'm like looking
at these pictures there's like this main
picture of all the women in white and
that was I was there for that did
Katie's makeup in that picture it was
shot at Shiva's house which is like
absolutely stunning it's so beautiful
and it was just so cool to see that on
my Instagram feed and I have like behind
the scenes pictures for when I was there
but to like see the finalized picture
that's like on e and to watch the
trailer and like um so you guys know
Katie's the one like in the trailer
who's like eating a chicken wing she's
like so cool I love her I love Shauna I
mean the cast is really fun I mostly got
to know like Veronica Katie and Shauna
the most Emirates of Marissa
they were who I like kind of I don't
know was around the most I guess you
could say because of how scheduling was
and because of like glam squads and all
that type of stuff but yeah I'm just I'm
so excited it's just so cool it's like
the first time not like legit I got to
see my stuff in such a public way you
know what I mean so I'm just stupid if
you can't tell hello I keep frickin
rambling this was definitely not the
look I was expecting to wear tonight me
and Sam are gonna go to a play he like
random well Sam's been wanting to see
the play fun house for a while and
found out that it stops playing in April
early April it's not like the first of
April and so he's like let's go so we
found some tickets and we're gonna go
tonight we're very spontaneous but I'm
like doing this and then on the next
video I'm filming today is going to be
about glitter roots so I'll be adding
glitter to this hot mess
and we'll see how that looks now I'm
just going back in with those to the mix
of the DTF and the color Oh downfall not
undone downfall that's what I've been
using this whole time and I'm just kind
of blending that Alchemist color alchemy
color out I mean so far I think it's
pretty I'm just gonna use the blue on
the lower lash line I want to so you
don't even realize that's me hiding the
color I'm being honest with y'all I'm
gonna go back in and just kind of punch
in a little bit more of the alchemy
color because some of it got lost while
you're blending and we're also gonna go
back in with the lucky color and I'm
gonna just Pat and blend and reign just
touch up that color make sure it's
pretty intense and we kind of want them
to melt together in the middle and for
that perfect blend we're all back in and
we're just patting you know you know how
I like to do it's like just kind of Pat
over and that's looking pretty good to
me I'm okay with that I'm chill with
what that's looking like I'm gonna go
back in and sweep out a little bit more
of the fallout I think I have a little
bit going on here
I didn't want to get on with the bare
face that's why I did all my face makeup
already but you might want to do your
eyeshadow first though if you were you
know not wanting to have to clean up so
much I'm gonna go in with some liners
now I'm gonna go in with my two favorite
this is pop beauty's bronze bonanza this
is steel is like white liner tight
lining and putting a little bit on the
lower lash line and I'm going to be
putting this on my waterline we have
that all done so now we're going to move
on to the lower lash line I'm gonna take
a smudging brush and we're gonna go in
with the dark blue shade on the lower
lash line I traditionally would hate to
do this I would never do this but for
the sake of this tutorial and the
palette bingo aspect of this we're going
in so I'm gonna be putting that closest
to the lash line and I'm just used
as a definer shade and I'm keeping it on
the outer portion of the ìiî it's very
it's a very dark color it's very
pigmented and I just don't want it to
close off the eye so don't go too far in
with that I'm now gonna go in and use a
fluffier brush I'm gonna go in with that
downfall color and just kind of blend
out some of that blue if you really want
to make the blue intense you could blend
it out with this color here freeze oh
look that's my setup guys if you wanted
to know anyway I'm gonna go on with that
and just blend it out cuz I really I
don't want it to be intense
I'm already just doing too much you know
I'm gonna look like the Freak like look
at my hair today I haven't even
mentioned that like just forgive me it's
kind of like I'm trying to pretend in my
head that it's like crazy it's like cute
crazy you know like crazy cute like yeah
it's kind of psycho but I'm cute I don't
know if that's working but I'm
pretending it is just so not being such
a baby I'm gonna go back in with the
blue and just put it really really close
on the very outer portion just so you
know so you guys know I tried I mean I'm
not trying to completely throw away the
blue color entire for the inner portion
of my I am actually gonna go back in
with that lucky shade and I'm just gonna
put that on the bottom lashline blend it
into the blue just kind of mimic what's
happening on the top on the bottom I'm
not really feeling this look I know it's
not like ugly but again it's just like
not I like more in crazy colors but um
like out and about like my everyday life
but I still feel pretty in them this I
feel like a little weird and now I'm
gonna put Bobby dazzle on the inner
corner to just kind of bring some light
into the eyes and kind of round out this
fourth of July look we need some light
we got the red we got the blue I've got
to have the light I think I might be
more happy if that Reds punched up a
little bit more so I'm gonna go back in
without me with a different brush but I
just wanted to look I guess a little bit
more like on purpose and not like it's
faded throughout the day or something
those are the eyes so far I'm gonna do
and cleanup more fallout and I'm also
gonna go in with mascara and I'll show
you guys the final look and we'll be
done with this palette bingo
I know you seem kind of negative in this
I mean it's not that bad I think it's
just more like I know what I'm doing
tonight and so in my head I'm just like
you know we're probably gonna be around
a bunch of old people out this play and
they're probably gonna hate my eyes well
it's LA though yeah a little Marc
subject for mascara I'm gonna use the
pure fully charged okay guys that is the
final look I hope you enjoyed this
palette bingo it's definitely always a
challenge to pick out some shadows and
try to be creative with them I think
overall this eye looks really nice I
think it would have been fun to do
something though with the blue and the
gold as like your smokey eye or
something but again I just wanted
something a little bit more wearable I
think I might do the Kat Von D movie
Dolapo remix palette next with this
series but if you have any suggestions
down below definitely leave them I'm
kind of running out of colorful palettes
but we can always do something neutral
too that's not completely out of the
question it's just in general picking
random shadows and coming up with a look
so that's everything guys thanks so much
for like listening to my news and I hope
you enjoyed the tutorial I hope you're
having a great day thanks so much for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
