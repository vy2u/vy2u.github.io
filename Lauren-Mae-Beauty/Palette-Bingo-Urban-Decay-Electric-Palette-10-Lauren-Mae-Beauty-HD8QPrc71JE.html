Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're doing a fun video we're
gonna do a palette bingo now if you
don't know these were started by Emily
Noelle I'm gonna leave her original
video link down below but I have done
quite a few of these on my channel
before the entire idea about this is
that you are supposed to kind of go into
a more colorful palette she gives the
example of like the BH 88 color palettes
or the ones I have a ton of different
colors and you're gonna go through and
pick like bingo five different shades at
random that you're gonna use on your
eyes and have to create a look out of
now I don't have any of the BH Cosmetics
or those really huge palettes so I kind
of tweaked this the way that I want to
but today we're going to be going in
with the Urban Decay electric palette
I'm really excited
someone requested that I do a palette
bingo with this one so since there are
not as many colors in here and obviously
they are all bright colors I'm only
going to be picking three at random
today just because I do want to look
that it's still gonna be pretty like I
like the idea of these as in going
outside of your comfort zone and kind of
inspiring you maybe in a different way
than you normally would to use a palette
but I don't want to just like put all of
these colors on my eyes to put all these
colors on my eyes yeah so we're gonna
pick three at random out of this palette
mine's very very dirty because if you
can't tell like I love this palette so
so much it's so good
I don't have my face makeup on today
because I'm probably gonna get a ton of
fallout it's really gonna be a bright
colorful look so I just have my eyebrows
and a base and primer on and then I
think the only other thing I really have
to talk about before we get into it I do
have some shadows just to kind of like
use as transitions and facilitate my
look but there was like a fluffy going
on in the air
anyway I do have some neutral colors to
kind of facilitate looks I don't know
what I'm gonna get obviously because
we're picking at random here so yeah
let's just get into it I use random dot
work on my phone to decide what the
colors are so this palette
ten different colors so I'm going to put
the options in as one through ten and
see what we get so generate number eight
is the first one okay so I'm doing it
like from the top of the palette over so
this would be one two five six seven
eight
number eight is this purple I'm not mad
about it I'm gonna do these swatches and
then it's gonna stay in my hand so that
is the first color there that is the
color urban really really pretty I hope
I get the pink but I'm sure you guys
will be like please alright next is
number six so this is it there this is
the color chaos on camera it's looking
kind of weird but it is a cobalt
traditional cobalt blue and this is
actually a matte color so there's a
swatch of Kaos man blue in my videos
lately right can't get enough of it the
next color is number one which is the
silver we're doing a very cool toned
look so the silver in the palette is
called the revolt that's it there I
actually don't think I've ever used this
silver ever so that'll be kind of fun
too
I kinda already have an idea of what I'm
gonna do we'll see but that's the silver
there I'm gonna pick one more color I
was just gonna do three but let's see if
we get something spicy or if we get
something in the same room and last is
number seven so number seven is freaking
this purple here I tried guys this is
the color jilted it's a really pretty
warm toned purple
it almost looks pink when it's by a
purple but it looks purple by a pink so
that's the color palette we're working
with today really exciting I am excited
to do this it should be super fun I had
an idea of what I was gonna do but now
that I got jilted I think I'm gonna do
something a little bit different I kind
of want to try a halo I I don't know
okay first off I'm gonna go in with the
color bel-air this is a nice like
neutral brown it's not too warm it's not
too cool and I'm just gonna be buffing
that into my crease as a transition
color to then work on those other shades
it's interesting I really kind of wanted
to get the green but I'll just have to
do another one of these with that
palette with my palette bingos
to kind of mark them as like palette
bingo Urban Decay electric 1.0 and then
like as we do it more it's like 2.0 you
know like a second round so if you guys
want to see a second one of these
definitely let me know I think these are
just so much fun to really push yourself
to do something interesting and
different put color combinations
together that maybe you think wouldn't
go and maybe you hate it maybe you love
it I also want to do this with my ice
cream palette I was going to do that
today but I thought I would just go more
adventurous whoo here we go already
getting into it first off I'm gonna go
in with just uh kind of like fluffy ish
brush and we're gonna be going into
where's my palette I don't know how this
already ended up on the floor but we're
gonna go in with the color chaos first I
know we're just going big so that is
this sheet over here it's the blue and
we're gonna be working that on the inner
and outer corner of the eyes I mean
these are so pigmented I know this
palette is discontinued now so you can
use if you do follow along or want to do
something similar I just suggest using
something that you have that's similar I
also feel like the new hood appellate is
very similar to this which you will find
out in other videos I don't know what
order I'm gonna be uploading in but I
will be picking that one up I'm just
starting off with putting it on the
outer corner first I'm not bringing it
up too high because I think that's
something with color that can happen and
that's what kind of makes it crazies if
you go too high with it so we can always
blend higher so just kind of keep it low
and then for the inner corner I'm gonna
go in with a smaller brush and this is
kind of something a little bit more
dense and we're gonna pack that on the
very inner corner as well and you can
kind of start blending it up also into
the crease because with a halo eye you
usually do have the colors kind of
connected at the top there oh wow here
we frickin go right and I'm just kind of
deepening up with that more small brush
on the very outer corner next I want to
just bring in this is just like a flat
angled brush we're going to go into the
darker purple this is the
urban and we're just gonna start putting
this on the outer portion and the inner
portion working our way inside to that
Center I don't know what the best brush
to like pack this color on is gonna be
so I might switch between brushes I'm
now going under the flat shader just to
see if that kind of helps and so we're
just trying to find right now a way to
meld these colors together the best way
we can so we're going to be going back
and forth and back and forth it's gonna
be kind of a lot so I definitely suggest
taking your time having some patience
because you're probably gonna be at this
step for a good while all right we saw a
lot of blending to do but I'm going to
be moving on now and we're gonna be
going in with the shade jilted which is
that Center one and I'm going to be
putting this on the inner portion I'm
just using my finger because I think
it'll be the easiest and we're gonna
work on melding all these colors
together we'll see how it works I'm not
sure how I feel about this but we're in
it so that looks really good I'm really
liking the way I look so I'm gonna just
be working on blending out the edges
making sure there's just a nice
transition I don't know I'm not really I
don't like the edge of the blue I like
everything else so I'm gonna try to find
a way to make that look better in my
eyes however I do that I'm not sure yet
you know I'm also going to kind of punch
in the blue on the inner corner if you
like the purple kind of like went over
it quite a bit so I'm just gonna take a
little brush and bring that blue just
make it a little bit stronger on that
inner corner so one of the ways I think
I'm going to get a better blend and
really enjoy this I look a little more
is I'm going to take a very like duo
fibre blending brush I'm gonna take that
purple and I'm going to be blending that
into the crease above the eye just so
there's a little bit more of a base
there and I'm gonna go back and forth
between that in the blue and then just
one last time I'm gonna go back in with
the blue and just really punch that out
on the inner and outer
corner I feel like if that's the color
that keeps getting kind of like blended
away now that we have that all done oh I
know a lot guys I just dropped my
palette again I'm gonna go home and just
kind of blend out some edges with just
some matte browns
there's a lot of blending in this look
for now I'm just going to kind of like
clean up underneath my eyes we'll start
getting a base on and then I think I can
kind of like get a better idea of what
my eyeshadow is truly looking like I've
talked about this before but I don't
normally do my eyeshadow first I do it
when it's like really bright colors but
I'm used to seeing my face fully done
with my makeup on and having my face and
I think that really changes how I like
an eyeshadow look like I just feel like
my skin has so much like tonal variation
and I don't know I definitely feel like
I always like my look a lot better once
I see my face done even if I don't do
anything different for a primer today
I'm gonna be using the cookie smooth
glow hydrating a face primer I am
dropping everything and I'm just gonna
dot that around the face and blend it in
for foundation and mixing - this is the
NARS one the cream one that I've been
using a lot of lately that's in my
project pan and then I'm going to be
mixing in with the Sephora perfectionist
airbrush foundation I'm gonna be using
those together and I like to just take
out like a chunk of the NARS put on the
back of my hand and then I'll spray
these Sephora one on it to mix them and
I am gonna be going a bit more full
coverage today since you know the eye
look is pretty intense I don't want
anything distracting
so if you have a blank canvas and it's
gonna look the best
it's so weird cuz the airbrush one is
like when it comes out it's like really
cold it's so weird anyway so that's like
what I'm getting now I'm gonna adopt
this all over my face and then today for
blending in you guys know I've been
liking to use brushes and I have this
brush from pur that I got sent from
actually it came with that foundation
which I did
like but I thought I would try once
again to like these freaking brushes I
see everyone use them and I don't know
why I don't like them I don't know guys
I just don't get it I don't get these
brushes I don't feel like it's giving me
any control I'm feeling I'm getting less
coverage than I would with other brushes
I don't understand the height I decided
to switch to a Beauty Blender just
because it was a Larkin video looks
pretty good we're gonna go in with
concealer this is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear waterproof concealer in 1c
light I'm just gonna use a little bit of
that because we might need to go back
under if I have to touch up anything
with my eyes so I don't want anything to
get too heavy I feel like I always say
that and then I go back and editing and
I'm like and then she proceeds to put on
a ton of product honestly I know people
talk about this all the time that the
lights really do they fool you guys so
much because I think on camera my skin
looks super full coverage right now but
it's really not in real life
all right let's set this stuff in place
I'm gonna go in under my eyes and in my
t-zone with the kiss Pro touch powder
just translucent and then to set the
rest of the face I'm going in with this
Clarins powder this is the everlasting
compact I've been really liking this
it's a very silky powder that does not
add a lot of texture to the skin it all
sounds like such a weird scent it almost
smells like Garnier Fructis or something
like very sweet and like citrus not
citrusy I don't know fruity it's very
interesting but I've been liking the way
it looks I don't feel like it gives me
that much coverage though so if you were
gonna use this as like your powder
foundation I don't know if it would be
like your traditional heavy coverage
powder foundation I'm like I don't know
how I feel about this I look for bronzer
we're going in with the Estee Lauder
bronze goddess
I've really
enjoying this bronzer I am trying to use
my Laguna a lot right now but honestly I
find myself wanting to reach for this
one it just goes on so nice and light
just built up nicely my earrings match
very well I didn't plan that obviously
so that's a good thing for a blush today
I just picked out a neutral one I think
it'll still look good with it so this is
from Tarte and it is the blush that we
got for our birthdays this is the color
part a party I guess the emphasis is on
the a is not that a highlight today I'm
not doing anything too exciting this is
my Urban Decay illusion highlighter and
well not highlighter eyeshadow that I
use as a highlighter I'm just going to
put quite a bit of that on I kind of
want to look glowy I don't know I've
been liking highlighter lately I know I
talked so much crap man but for whatever
reason I feel like it's just looking
good on the skin it definitely looks
good on camera - we are back to the eyes
so some things I've been noticing as
I've had some time to kind of like
decide what I'm gonna do and get my face
on I'm liking a look a lot better that's
always how it turns out but as always I
just have trouble matching my eye shapes
I know I'm supposed to be a professional
here this is definitely like lower this
comes higher on the lid so I'm just
gonna kind of work to fix that and match
them and hopefully not get fallout on my
freaking face that'd be cool I'm also
gonna go in and kind of fix up the tail
here this one just has a nice soft blend
and this one just looks weird so I'm
gonna see if I can fix that with a
little concealer and a little love all
right I think that's the best it's gonna
get I don't mess around with it too much
more I feel like things are gonna go
crazy even more crazy for the inner
corner you guessed it I'm going galactic
and we are gonna be putting that silver
on there you could obviously always
switch up how you're going to do this
but color wise but this is just the way
I chose so I'm gonna spray it down with
mac fix+ - I really want it to be quite
um metallic I feel like I could be an
extra
in the movie Xena you know like I could
be up there zoom-zoom-zoom and I'm
carrying that silver quite like around
the inner tear-duct quite a bit for the
lower lashline I am gonna put some white
liner in so I'm just tight lining with
the white and I really want to put the
like warm color down like that's the
color I'm gravitating to I really want
to punch that back in and bring that
accent out so I'm gonna be going in and
really packing that and blending it out
on the lower lash line I do think it's
looking a little weird without anything
connecting it so I'm going to go in with
the dark purple chaos no urban and I'm
gonna just kind of use that as a segue I
feel crazy and just look let me tell you
and I'm just gonna blend out the edges
and I bring that silver like into the
pink or purple
I really think mascara is gonna tie this
together because my god something better
I'm also going to actually tight line
I'm just using a black just a little bit
nothing too too much for mascara today
I'm going in with my number seven lash
impact ultra and I'm really gonna coat
those lashes so I can get as much volume
and definition as possible this would be
a great time to go in with false lashes
maybe I'll put them on I don't know
probably not but maybe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
