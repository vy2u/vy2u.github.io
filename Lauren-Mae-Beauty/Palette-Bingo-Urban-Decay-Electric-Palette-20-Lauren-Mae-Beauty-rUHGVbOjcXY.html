Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're going to be doing another
pellet bingo and today I have nothing on
my face I just have my eyebrows done
because we are gonna be going in with
the electric palette I have done one
other palette bingo with this all leave
that link down below as well as the
playlist but yeah we're gonna try it
again so this will be the electric
palette palette bingo 2.0 last time I
remember getting a lot of these like
purple blues it was an intense look a
lot of you guys liked it it was
something that I wasn't super fond of
while I was creating it something I
realized is that with my looks I'm Way
more harsh on them like while I'm doing
it and it's hard to have perspective in
this setup because it's not my normal
setup for when I do my makeup and then
when I look back at it on camera I'm
usually like oh well I wasn't as bad as
I thought sometimes it's worse I don't
know and the more you edit it the longer
you look at it you're like blue anyway
that being said we're gonna be doing a
palette bingo today with this I'm going
to be picking only four colors from this
palette since it's pretty intense and we
will be doing that randomly also with
palette bingos I do it kind of the emily
noel style in the sense that you can use
other shadows you just have to use the
ones that you picked out of the palette
so i do have some other shadows here to
help maybe make a better look I'm
filming a couple videos today so I want
this look to actually look good that's
the goal
other than that though let's get on to
random org and pick our shadow so we can
get into the look alright the first
shadow that I've picked is number 10
that will be the last shade in the
palette and you all know I'm excited
because that means it is this green and
this is a color I've really been into so
this is the shade thrash from the
palette this has a fine like sparkle to
it so I'm really excited about that the
next one I picked is the shade number
one and that is the silver shade so this
one here this is the color revolt I know
a lot of people don't really like this
color
I don't mind it and I think with a
glitter glow we can make that work for
sure feeling very like futuristic alien
vibes which I am a hundred percent down
with alright let's see number four we
got the shade number six so that is
going to be one two
four or five and number six is the blue
this is the shade chaos and it's like a
true cobalt blue oh wow look at that
I got chaos last time as well and then
the last shade we have is number three
and that is the color slow burn which is
this orange
so definitely a different color palette
this time this is kind of a mix of a
bunch of different things so yeah I'm
gonna create something fun hopefully
with those shadows I don't know what all
right so I kind of think I have an idea
of what I want to do so first I think
I'm gonna blend out the transition with
the green put the blue in the outer
corner the silver on the lid and then do
a bit of the orange on the under eye to
complement that blue yeah I think that's
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna probably add
in the darker green in this palette to
kind of make a nice transition with the
blue so that's what we're gonna go for I
already have my lids primed and since I
haven't done my face I will be showing
you that portion of this video as well
so it'll be a little bit longer of a
palette bingo but I hope you guys don't
mind I'm gonna zoom us in and let's get
started so the first thing I want to
start doing is building up the green
thrash in the crease I'm gonna be using
this almost like it's a matte although
it does have that shimmer so hopefully
that works out I'm going to be buffing
this pretty much all over the lid it is
so pigmented well and I did not set my
primer because I did want these shadows
to have something nice to stick to so
hopefully that doesn't mess us up too
much when it comes to blending and like
I normally do I really do want to make
sure I have a good amount of green on
this portion since I do have hooded eyes
it tends to get lost easily like when I
have my eyes all the way open and I'm
just looking so I want to make sure I
have color here alright now that I have
that down I like the way it's looking a
lot like I just love this color green
you guys know so I'm gonna go in with
the shade freak which is next to it this
is a bit of a darker green and I'm just
going to be working that into the crease
as well just to give myself a bit more
of a base so that way when we go in with
the blue it won't be as harsh of a
transition I also I don't want to
build that blew up too much that shade
can get really deep and dark pretty fast
so I want to be careful about that off
the bat this is a shimmer not sure how
I'm feeling about it I was just gonna go
for it but I definitely see that
reflective Ness coming through
so hopefully that didn't just ruin
everything and I'm just going in with
that green to blend out the edges all
right so next I'm gonna go in with the
shade chaos and I'm using a small
blender I mean this just picks up so
much on the brush so tapping off and I
really want to build up slowly I found
with this shade it can get a little
patchy and weird so I really want to
make sure I'm blending it nicely as you
blend the shade out it does lose a bit
of its vibrancy so something I'm gonna
focus on is just getting the blend and
then at the very end I'm gonna go back
in and like punch the color on so we
have a more saturated blue but we still
have those outer edges that are more
blended alright and now I'm just going
to be going back and forth between all
those green shades we use as well as the
blue and just trying to get a nice blend
I'm liking the way it looks and honestly
I feel like the shimmer in the green for
whatever reason looks really good so
that's that's great I also will say like
I already know like I never would have
done this color combination and I'm kind
of feeling like it's definitely
different for me but I really do like it
so far and I think with that silver on
the lid it's really gonna be a fun pop
so so far so good and I really want to
make sure I have this like lime green
punching through here so we don't have
too much darkness and we still have that
like fun pop of color I think that's
pretty good for blending so far so let's
move on to the silver shadows I'm going
to be using the NYX glitter primer so
that way we can get the most tacky base
for that solider to show up on it's kind
of this it's pretty but it is a bit
sheer so this will definitely make it
pop I'm just gonna use the other end of
this Urban Decay brush and make sense
right with the
electric palette okay so I'm gonna go in
with the silver and I'm not gonna foil
it at first just to see and I'm gonna
foil it so I'm just gonna spray the
brush and then go in over the base
and then I'm gonna use my finger just to
make sure it's as opaque as possible I
got a little high with the color over
here so I wish I could do that but I did
so I'm gonna go now into the chaos shade
and we're just going to be patting this
over the silver and building up that
really pop of blue that I was talking
about earlier and just getting a nice
blend on those two
and to help get the blend like when my
brush doesn't have a lot of product on
it I'm going over even where it's pretty
silver just so it can turn into like
this blue silver these are quite
different in contrast like the blue is
really dark the silver is really light
so getting a blend is a little bit
harder so I'm trying to almost create
this like blue silver in the middle a
little bit to help transition them all
right after a crap-ton of blending I
think this is it I hope that the eyes
are even but I kind of I'm kind of done
I think overall though it looks really
cool really pretty I'm really happy with
it I'm gonna go into some wipes and just
clean up all the fallout I'm really
happy that I did my eyes first because I
just didn't have to worry about all the
fallout like ruining everything that I
already did no I will say I like this
look so much I'm nervous to add the
orange in because I really don't want to
like just ruin all the coolness we have
going on so that's something I'm a
little nervous about but we'll figure
something out I think let's prime our
faces I'm using the Ofra cool as a
cucumber primer this is sent to me from
op de lis and I just wanted something
kind of moisturizing so I thought this
one would be nice just to give it some
moisture back in I find too when you use
the wipe and you like wipe everything
away no matter what you put on before
obviously it's gonna wipe it away
so this will bring back some of that
hydration I hate doing my eyes first
because I feel like you know a look
comes together once you have everything
on and my face has so much red to it
that it's hard to like see the look in
itself or by itself but also because my
eyebrows are hard to like get around
will make it work I'm gonna try to use
this product from number 7 this is the
airbrush away tinted skin Perfector it's
in the shade light but it is so effing
dark like that's how dark the light is I
don't even
it's very silicone II so I've been using
this
as more of like a primer then as an
actual thing I don't know I mean if you
are darker then I'd work I just feel
like the light shade is very deceiving
it blends out what quite well and it
doesn't leave a lot of color tint to the
skin well it's just a strange product I
did you know pick this out on the octoly
site but it's a lot different than I
thought it was gonna be I'm not really
sure how I feel about it
okay so that's kind of just a primer I
guess my skin feels super soft it's very
like silicone II it adds the tiniest bit
of tint it's just kind of a strange one
for foundation today I'm mixing two
colors of the AOA perfect BB cream I've
been using these in my last couple of
videos and I have been enjoying it so
I'm gonna be putting some of the fair
shade on my hand as well as some of the
light I feel like fairs to Fair lights
to dark so together they kind of make a
perfect baby a foundation for my skin
this doesn't have a ton of coverage and
it's quite like dewy but I've really
been enjoying it it looks really nice on
the skin so I like to apply that with a
sponge to really work it into the skin
and not have too much extra product on
my skin and what I want this to do for
me is just even out my skin tone and
then I'm gonna let the concealer do the
actual job of like getting rid of more
severe pigmentation as well as just
conceal under my eyes a little bit more
okay I think that looks pretty good I
like how I just got rid of some
discoloration but it still looks like
skin it's comfortable so I'm gonna go in
with concealer and just conceal under my
eyes I guess you could definitely use a
corrector and I kind of thought I was
going to but I just put concealer on so
guess I'm not I'm going to be putting a
little on my nose this is like my
hardest area for like keeping foundation
not only because I wear glasses in my
normal daily life but because my nose
just I'm very dry on the sides of my
nose no matter how much I tried to like
remedy that and exfoliate that does it
it does not matter this
look is really starting to pop now that
we have you know our base on so I'm just
going to blend in that concealer I
honestly don't really want to cover my
skin anymore so I'm gonna go in and set
it this is the AOA a perfect setting
powder it's a like white translucent
powder I've been like really loving this
stuff I like to work it into my brush
and then I make sure I don't have any
creases and set my eyes first I like how
this gives me a soft matte finish but it
really adds no extra texture to the skin
while we're still zoomed in I'm gonna do
the under eye portion which is what I
said I wanted to go in with the orange I
think it's gonna look pretty but I'm
also really scared so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to take the green and I'm
gonna take a little test on the back of
my hand so I'm gonna blend some of the
green and then I'm gonna try to blend
some of the orange in and just see what
happens because that green has a lot of
yellow in it I'm hoping it doesn't turn
to psycho but you know the little
experiment we're about to do will
definitely let us know what's up yeah
I'm just scared so what I think I'm
gonna do something I know I want for
sure is the green under my eye so I'm
going to take the green and buff it
under basically my whole eye kind of
keeping to the outer portion but just
blending it yeah just blend it halfway
I'm not gonna bring it here because I'm
gonna put the orange there I'm gonna add
a little bit of the darker green and
freak just closer to the lash line and
then I'm gonna go in with chaos just the
tiniest bit and just start blending it
into the outer corner and onto that
lower lash line we said we have some of
that depth there alright and then for
the orange we're just doing like a pop
of orange so I'm taking slow-burn and
I'm taking it on a smaller detail brush
and I'm gonna be putting this on the
very inner part of the eye blending into
the green but just barely cuz it does
kind of turn just like a darker shade if
this wasn't a palette bingo I probably
wouldn't have done this stuff but alas
it is alright that's not distracting at
all right so I'm gonna go do
liners I'm putting white on the
waterline I'm putting a brown on the
tight line as well as a little bit on
the lower lash line and then I'm gonna
put some of the Kiko golden waist
mascara on my eyes and then I'll be back
see days can have a close-up of the eye
look we'll finish out the face we'll
finish up the look yeah so far though I
will say this is like a 10,000,000 times
improvement on my last look you guys
have to admit no matter how would you
like that look
this one just is executed better I think
I had a better game plan for using that
Kaos shade so anyway I will be back and
show you the eyes up close alright so
here is the eyelid close-up all finished
with the liners in the mascara on I
freaking love this look so far even
though that little bit of orange red I
think is something interesting and kind
of just elevates it to something a
little bit more artistic so yeah I'm
feeling this look I feel like a little
space alien babe and I'm like loving it
so much yeah I will see - I've been
trying really hard to work on my
technique when it comes to blending I
feel like in real life I just kind of
like go lighter and don't blend as much
but on camera it looks so much better to
have more impact with your colors to go
a little bit more saturated than I
normally do in everyday life and just
just spend that little extra time blend
I like I've just been really happy with
it so far so anyway let's zoom out so we
can get some color on this face and
looking a little jaundice we need some
bronzer
ASAP so let me zoom out and we'll finish
up the look for bronzer today I'm going
in with the butter bronzer I not only
love this but we are working so hard on
it guys I'm so close to getting it gone
and I love it but it's exciting bronzer
is just my favorite part I love it for
blush today I'm going in with my Tarte
party blush it's pretty neutral so I'm
just going to put a little bit of that
on the cheeks do hear the music I just
hate my experience I hate them I mean at
least they're playing Drake so I can
like understand it but please okay so I
am going to now take okay before the
beat comes back in we're going to be
going in with this shade from Oprah and
pillow top to highlight the cheeks I'm
gonna spray my face down just to get rid
of any powder
it also makes that highlight like shine
so much more I want to actually
highlight my inner corner with that same
highlight just to kind of tie it in oh
wow
that was like ten times brighter than I
thought it was gonna be I think it was
still kind of wet from the setting spray
and now they're listening to post Malone
okay they're kind of my soul mate when
it comes to music but like not while I'm
filming I should just go up there and
party with them right it's like they've
watched my maybe they watch my videos
they know what was on my favorites list
I don't know okay okay we're gonna
finish it up I'm sorry guys I'm gonna
remove some of this foundation on my
lips as attractive as it is and I'm
gonna go simple I'm just gonna use this
Revlon plumping lip cream they just
started the whole album the first song
on his new album sound like we're gonna
get the whole postie album hopefully the
other day they were listening to Kanye
to the life of Paulo I'm like we really
are music soul mates but I absolutely
hate when people play their music too
loud and I can hear it in my house
alright just simple I mean the eyes
really are doing all the talking we
don't really need too much I know this
was a little bit longer of palette bingo
so I appreciate you guys holding in
there with me overall I am so extremely
excited about how this look turned out I
was kind of nervous especially when I
started getting that blue I was like no
not the freaking blue but I think it
turned out really well let me know what
you guys think and also let me know what
you want to see a palette bingo on in
the future
I always go back to old palettes because
since it's like random you know you can
do whatever you can do palettes over and
over and get a different look I would
have never paired these together and
that's what I love about palette Van
Gogh so much I also was thinking about
it I didn't bring in any neutrals like I
just use colorful ones I brought in one
extra shadow this other green but I'm
really proud about that too that I
didn't like use a brown kind of as a
crutch not saying you know sometimes you
need it and sometimes it's great but I
think I came out with a really pretty
look that I'm proud of without doing
that and that makes me happy it was a
good challenge so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed the video thank you so so much
for watching and I will see you in the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
