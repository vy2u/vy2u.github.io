learn thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing palette bingo
I took this idea from Emily Noel she did
an original palette bingo with like a
big Coastal Scents or one of those like
180 shadows really colourful palette and
randomly picked the shade she had to use
and then had to create an eye look with
those shades so I have done a couple of
these in the past on my channel I also
did a collab one with LS so I will leave
that all link down below so you can
check those out today we're gonna be
doing something a little different
because I am not gonna be using a really
colorful palette I feel like the
original idea behind this was to use
something colorful to like make you
branch out and use shades you normally
don't but I just want to be more neutral
today so I thought this would be a fun
way to spice up a neutral palette I'm
gonna be using the violet box Holy Grail
palette this is what it looks like I'm
sure you guys have mostly seen this but
it's very pretty warm toned kind of
Modern Renaissance feeling so although
this isn't very colorful I thought this
still would serve a purpose in the sense
that a lot of people don't wear color
and this is a fun way to spice up even
your neutral palette and maybe do
something that you wouldn't normally do
use colors and the pallets that you
don't normally gravitate to so I'm
excited to see what we pick so I have on
my phone here random.org that's how I
pick my shadows and let me count this up
I feel ill-prepared
let's see there are 20 shadows in this
palette so I'm gonna make my numbers 1
through 20
okay I'm gonna generate the first one
let's see number 9 so the first shadow
that I have to use oh I didn't tell you
I'm picking I'm gonna pick 5 shadows
that I have to use so umm 5 at 6 7 8
number 9 is the color chill this is a
shimmery like light golden brown color
definitely not one I would probably pick
but that's the first color let's see
what we get for the second number 8
right next to it that's the color toffee
so that's this one right here this one's
really really pretty
it definitely has more shine so
underneath it is toffee honestly I feel
like those colors are the same color but
more metallic and less metallic alright
we'll make it work next I picked number
three and that is the color thanks a lot
eh so that's just like a nice base shade
an easy one to fit into the look and
that's it's watched underneath it's
really close to my skin tone so you
can't really see it our fourth color is
number four and that is the color
transition so that's this one here I
feel like we're gonna do a very
monochromatic look again today so so far
that's what I'm working with the same
color and last is number seven I cook
number seven Wow we really didn't get
anything too funded me and that's the
color bestie well this turned boring I
feel like that's my my clickbait title
would be like palette bingo turned
boring okay so literally the same colors
that's what I get I have to use those
I'm thinking I'm gonna make it work
these can still be really pretty I'm not
trying to be negative you know we can do
something really just fun and kind of
simple smokey or something I mean I can
bring in darker colors if I want to I
just have to use those five so obviously
I have my face done so we're just gonna
get into it so first off I'm gonna get
the easiest one out of the way this is
the thanks a lot take color and I'm just
going to be putting that all over my lid
and brow bone just to you know prep the
area for shadow
I have already primed my eyelids as well
well it seems like transition is
slightly lighter than bestie so I'm
gonna go in with transition first I'm
going to be using my Sigma e-40 this is
my favorite brush to work into the
crease I'm just going to you know build
that up kind of gently I don't need to
too much you know what I'm thinking
right now I think I am just gonna use
the colors that I got because I think I
can create something really beautiful
and I think it'll show that you can have
like really simple eye shadow looks that
are beautiful you don't need a million
colors it's okay to be more simple so
I'm gonna do that and I think it's a
challenge to to only use those ones so
I'm gonna just do it this time today and
I think it'll look really pretty
okay so I have that nice and blended so
we just have a nice transition I'm going
to be doing just like a nice basic smoky
eye it's really gonna bring out the blue
in my eyes because these are quite warm
like golden e Brown colors I'm going in
with bestie which is the third color
that we're using out of the ones we have
too and I'm gonna be bring
this down a little bit further I want
the drama to be closest to the lash line
and then build up into a nice transition
I'm taking besties on a flat shader
brush and I'm just bringing that down
onto the lid just because we're working
with lighter colors I don't want to miss
out on any drama but we could have it
any definition that we could have now
I'm gonna go in with the color toffee
and I'm just going to be putting that on
my finger and I'm going to put that all
over the lid area and I'm just kind of
blending out with my finger this color
is a lot more yellow than I realized it
would be I think it's pretty definitely
brings a little spice something this is
the spiciest color we have who knew
toffee could be so spicy that is a super
pigmented color okay I'm gonna go back
in with the color bestie and transition
and just kind of blend out so we have a
nice edge I am gonna use one color that
isn't from the five and that is gonna be
be color crystal I'm gonna be using that
on the inner corner just so we have
something bright to kind of liven this
look up this is the drama right there
boom I think this is a great palette I
know for a long time people were raving
about it and saying it was so good
and I was so skeptical I did get this
IMAX this year and it's really good
I think the quality of it is really nice
and I think you get a nice shade range
there are some repeat colors but it is a
nice just like everyday palette now I'm
gonna do some liner work I'm gonna keep
this video kind of short so I'm gonna
cut out a lot of it just so that way I'm
not always doing just only get ready
with means that are like mmm forever
long so for liners I'm gonna be going in
with this laura geller brown sugar liner
I'm in a tight line with this I'm also
gonna take a little bit of Urban Decay's
$19.99 liner and I'm gonna run that on
my lower lash line and rub it out with
my fingers and then I'm going to be
putting a white liner on my waterline
just to kind of brighten my eyes I
always like doing this so I have my
liners on next I'm going to go in with
the last shade that we need to use
called chill which is this one here and
I'm going to be running
on my lower lashline and just kind of
smoking out my lower lashline with that
color
I feel like this look definitely comes
together once you use your mascara you
can also do more liquid liner if you
haven't noticed I don't do a lot of
liquid liner because I do have hooded
eyes so if I do too much liner when I
look at you straight I lose so much lid
space that I can't ever see color you
can't see like pretty shimmers so for me
I just used the tight line as a way to
define and thicken my lash line without
covering up the small amount of real
Adia have on my lids so for mascara
today I'm gonna be going in with this
one from Kiko Milano this is the summer
2.0 and this is a really cool mascara
has a really tiny wand I have been using
this more and more and it doesn't flake
like it did the first two times I don't
know what happened I must have done
something I didn't realize but it didn't
flake at all yesterday so I have been
really enjoying this I can get super
fluffy lashes like I feel like my lashes
look like fake lashes when I wear this
so I do really like it and you can get
so close to the lash line which is my
favorite part about this mascara so last
for this look I'm going to finish up the
lips for lip liner I'm using the by
Terry Rose contour shade and on the 7th
s I'm working on it in a project and I'm
just going to lightly outline my lips
just so they're defined because the
gloss I'm going in with is a little bit
more nude and kind of like subdued so
this will just make sure I don't lose
any fullness in my lips but in the lip
gloss I'm going in with today is from
Eden minerals I'm going to just put a
little bit of this on it's more cool
toned but I think it pairs nicely with
that lip liner alright guys well that's
the final palette bingo I was not
expecting this one to be so short and
simple I guess but it was I hope you
enjoyed it anyway let me know down below
if you want to see me do more of these
I'm thinking I'm gonna switch off
between like doing a colorful palette
and then maybe doing a neutral palette
just to have some options and just some
different things because as much as I
love color I don't want to wear it every
single day in every single video
sometime
I feel really pretty in something just
simple like this so and that is
everything thank you so so much for
watching guys and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
