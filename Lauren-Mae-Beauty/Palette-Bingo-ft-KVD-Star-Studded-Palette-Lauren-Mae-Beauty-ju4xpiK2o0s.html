with a palette bingo today i'm going to
be doing the palette bingo with the Kat
Von D's star-studded palette I put this
palette in my project pan roulette which
I'll leave link down below and someone
suggested in there to do a palette bingo
with it to kind of get familiar with the
colors and kind of help me decide which
one I'm going to try to hit pan on so I
thought that was an awesome idea there
24 shadows in this palette so lots of
options
I feel like compared to my vice for one
that I've done which again that will be
linked down below too I feel like there
are way more neutrals in here so we'll
see how it goes but I think we can still
get something super fun if you've never
seen a palette being go before I will
leave Emily Noelle's original video link
down below she's the one who started
this and basically you pick five random
shadows from this I'll be using a random
number generator to do that and you have
to incorporate all five of those shadows
add a minimum into your look you can
pull in other shadows but you have to
use those five so let's get to picking
I'll be picking them on my phone
the first number I got is number 12 and
I am counting across this way so for 812
that is this light lavender color
that's it swatch there it's kind of hard
to see I'm sorry but that is called a
violator the next shadow is number two
and that's this really pretty bronze
color up here at the top
that's it below the purple and that's an
affiliate the next one I picked is
number 18 and so that is it's a neutral
Brown kind of color but it's definitely
a cool toned and that third shade there
is called heaven knows the fourth shade
out of the palette I have to pick is
this one here number 20 it's a dark
olive green it's pretty dang dark and
that one's called covenant and the last
shadow I have to pick here is number one
which is and that is just like a matte
peachy toned nude color it's right there
it's basically my skin tone though so
you can't really see it so that's what I
have to work with this color palette
reminds me of when I worked at justice
every year we'd always get a camo
colored shirt in and it would always
either be mixed with purple or with pink
and it kind of reminds me of like the
bronzy camo purple type of shirts
weekend and I don't know why so I have
to use all five of these shades and then
I can incorporate other thing
I think I might eat incorporate some
other stuff I don't know I mean this is
a really pretty eye by itself so I might
just leave it so let's get into it so
I've already primed my eyes before it
started this and I did my eyebrows just
to have something to go off of so I'm
gonna go in with the peachy shade here
and put that just all over my eyelid and
like kind of in the crease this is just
a really light transition color I feel
like this one was really easy especially
compared to the last one
next I'm gonna go into heaven knows and
I'm just going to put that in my crease
lightly and potentially build it up more
on the outer corner but just put that in
there now that that's blended in the
crease I'm gonna go in with a flat
shader brush and put the bronze color
that I have to use well I got a little
bit of the red in there I'm gonna put
that on the lid just all over the lid I
feel like this is super easy I don't
know I'm just gonna pack that all over
the lid
and then you guessed it for the fourth
straight I'm going into I believe it was
called covenant but it's a like olive
brown I'm just going to get a little bit
and tap off a lot of the extra and I'm
gonna use that to just deepen up the
outer crease or outer V shape of my eye
just to spice things up a little bit I'm
gonna take this gold just with my finger
I'm just gonna kind of Pat that on the
center of the eye just to give it a
little bit more of like a sprucing up I
don't know just something interesting
now I'm just going in and blending out
any harsh areas I'm going to take a more
precise blending brush and take that
haveno shade and just kind of blend
everything out
I'm taking a densely packed dome brush
and I'm gonna go into that
purple shade it's like a almost
iridescent purple it's gonna be my inner
corner I'm also gonna take this cream
shade and put that underneath my brow
bone just to highlight it and kind of
blend stuff out for under the lash line
I decided to bring in a little bit more
of that purple I'm gonna go in with this
purple shade and just smudge that really
close to the lash line
and then taking a more fluffy angled
brush I'm gonna go in with the heaven
nose again and just blend out that
purple on the lower lash line I'm gonna
go do my face really fast add mascara
probably some lashes eyeliner and all
that and then I'm gonna come back and
you guys can see the final look let's
see how it worked out I think this is
pretty simple not that that's not
exciting but you know I would never have
used these colors before but let's see
I'll be back with my face
so this is the final look guys I
actually been going with lashes because
I thought that since the eye look was a
little bit lighter you could see my
natural lashes through the eyeshadow and
I didn't really need them plus I was
just not wanting to put them on really I
could go in with a purple liner
underneath my lash line this is Urban
Decay's psychedelic sister I just
thought it would bring in a little bit
more purple into the look and then I
also thought I would add a little bit
more of that purple to the inner corner
it definitely isn't popping as much as I
want it to so I brought out my mac fix+
I'm gonna spray my brush and to see if I
can kind of build up that color a little
bit just so I don't know it's a little
brighter I just feel like this look is
kind of boring but definitely brought
the purple inward I definitely like the
purple amped up a little bit more it
gives it a little bit more excitement
I'm really glad that I chose this
palette to do this look with I will say
it's just not my favorite I don't know I
might depart a couple shadows from here
and then pass it on like I like this
shade I like that shade I like this one
because it's like a duochrome
the goal did I put on the middle of the
lid I think was really pretty too but I
have a ton of gold shades so I don't
know I'm after using this I think the
look looks better than I thought it did
in camera like when I'm up close and
stuff it's definitely not something I
would have picked by myself because I
don't really gravitate to greens at all
but I think it turned out pretty it's
okay it's on my favorite I think I like
my look last time just a little better
because I think it was just a little bit
more interesting but anyway I mean this
is how the look turned out I hope you
