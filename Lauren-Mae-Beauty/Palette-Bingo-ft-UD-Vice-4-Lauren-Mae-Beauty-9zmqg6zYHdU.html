it's Lauren this is going to be a
different video I am going to be doing
palette bingo I've never done that
before I saw this on Emily Noel 83s
channel I love her I will leave her
linked down below she came out with this
like in February I don't know why it
took me so long to see it but it did and
she used an 88 like BH Cosmetics type of
palette and she basically just picked
five random shades and created a look
with them I thought this would be really
fun I have a lot of colorful eyeshadows
and you guys know I'm not a stranger to
color but I mostly wear neutrals still I
mean as much as I do colorful looks I
don't know I can always use more color
in my life I guess so I thought this
would be really fun I never purchased
any of you like Coastal Scents 88
palettes of the BH Cosmetics ones but I
do have the Vice 4 which has 20
different shades in it that's what they
look like so I'm going to be using a
random generator on my phone to pick a
number one through 20 and I'll just go
this way through to decide what colors I
get and I'll swatch them for you and
everything yeah other than that the
rules are pretty simple I have to use
all five colors in my look and I can use
any other colors on top of that though
so if I need like a matte cream color or
something like that I can do that my
face is pretty basic I used a little bit
of foundation I haven't put on concealer
yet or anything like that because I
don't know if I'm gonna get fallout
because I don't know what sheets I'm
gonna get so we shall see let's just get
into this so I have a random number
generator here so the first one is
number 14 so that would be 10 11 12 13
14 and that is the color arctic already
a hard one I don't normally do blues so
so that is the color arctic now to
generate another one let's see generate
okay generate again now I did 14 twice
but this is number 20 so number 20 is
this color all the way in the corner the
like last shade in the palette and that
is the color delete it's a matte dark
brown definitely
something I can use so far those are the
two colors I have to use now I have
number 16 I don't think you guys can see
it cuz it's like blurry I'm not cheating
I promise I'd be no fun number 16 so
that's 1415 number 16 the color bitter
oh I'm not even in frame at all this is
number 16 that's like a me shade for
sure oh I have two Browns already that's
kind of easy I feel like but we'll see
so those are the three shades you guys
can't see them two more let's see when
we get it number five number five and
the palette is this sparkly dark purple
this is the color raid mmm Oh
pandemonium I thought it was an R at the
front so I thought was like randamonium
which I've never heard of before
no pandemonium hmm an actual word so
that's pandemonium pandemonium's much
there at the bottom all right we have
one more color I hope I get like the
pink or something like fun and bright or
warm hmm
it's kind of a cool tone except for that
Brown number six so number six is pretty
dang easy it's this one here and that's
the color framed and it's mostly just
like a cream color it's a little bit
deeper I can maybe use it like as a
transition you type of color it's there
at the bottom you can barely see it so
those are the five colors I have to use
in this tutorial or get ready with me a
palette bingo whatever I have to use
those but I can bring in anything I want
to which I probably will I'm probably
gonna go make a little artsy on it I
don't know what I'm gonna do so
hopefully I enjoyed let's just get into
the tutorial or get ready with me it's
not really a tutorial I don't really
know what I'm doing it hello first thing
I'm gonna go in with my 8:40 and I'm
gonna go into the color framed which
I'll just show you on my hand I'm gonna
go on to that color they're from the
palette framed and I'm gonna just kind
of put this loosely in my crease as a
transition color this is really all I
could do with this color since it is so
I feel like just light when I was
watching these it was really fun because
you just I have what I would do what the
colors people would pick and then what
they do is so different so it's just fun
to see different people being creative
with different looks you know so
that'd be fun for me to go through and
do with my collection let's see what I
get
okay so that basically did nothing but
it's one shadow down next I'm gonna go
in with bitter and I'm just gonna use it
on the same a fluffy brush and I'm just
gonna kind of lightly put it in first
because I don't quite know what I'm
doing and I don't want to go too heavy
yet so just lightly in the crease area I
kind of go above my crease cuz I do have
hooded eyes and I just find that it's
more flattering I'm thinking about doing
this with a bunch of my palettes cuz I
have a lot of like fun ones that have a
bunch of different colors in it and I
just think it would be a fun way to
continue to be inspired by the
collection I have and I love putting
together a bunch of shades you wouldn't
normally put together and then being
challenged to just create something
beautiful from that so I really like
that I'm gonna kind of go out of the box
we'll see I just came up with this idea
right now so I'm definitely using other
shades in the palette now that I have a
little bit of a transition going on I'm
gonna take a my concealer f7e brush from
Sigma that this is what I use all the
time to pack any color on my lid and I'm
gonna go into the color underhand right
here it's like a kind of burgundy plum
type of color and I'm gonna be putting
that all on my lids and then I'm going
to kind of just taking about halfway I'd
say I don't know how this is gonna turn
out which you guys obviously know
because that's the whole point of this
thing but I'm excited to just do
something fun this reminds me of like
pan that palette roulette style but with
eyeshadows and with like a tutorial so I
thought it'd be fun and I don't think
I've used like any of these colors
honestly I think I've used the pink in
here and that's really it so I'm glad
that I am finding a way to kind of use
these shades and be able to say that oh
yeah I've used them before at least geez
now that I have that I'm gonna take the
same brush and I'm gonna go in with the
shade pandemonium which is the like dark
plummet glittery shade a second one from
the bottom and that one's part of our
thing so right now this will be the
third color we've used out of the ones
we have to use I'm gonna be putting this
on the outer portion of the eye this
one's quite chunky so be careful and I
kind of brought that almost halfway into
the lid because I thought it looked kind
of pretty and there's a ton of fallout
I'm going back in with the other shade
which is under hand and just kind of
patting it so they blend a little better
okay now that I have both those colors
on I'm gonna go back into the color
bitter and I'm gonna take a more precise
but still blending brush this is from
Real Techniques I don't know what it is
but it's just like kind of their fluffy
blending type of brush and I'm just
gonna go really close and just kind of
blend out those corners so it doesn't
look so insane and I would keep this as
close as you can while you're blending
it out just so we don't get too crazy
and too high up I find that sometimes
it's hard with dark colors you just kind
of like lose control and before you know
it it's like a dark all the way up to
your brow bone so just stay low get low
with your eye shadow like it already
looks so much better
gosh blending is a miracle and we're
still only on the three shadows I only
have used the three so far I'm gonna go
back in again with a color we've already
used that framed color from the very
beginning and just again blend out any
of the harsh lines I might have my
eyebrows are done a little bit but I'm
probably gonna go in and darken them up
I just didn't know what I was gonna do
for this look so I didn't want to have
to stylize of a brow for a look or
something so that's just I'm gonna stop
that there now I just want to add some
other type of colors and just keep going
so I'm gonna go in with my Coastal
Scents 250 brush and I'm gonna go into
the color 1985 and I'm going to be kind
of focusing this just a little and tap
it off and I'm just going to
I know run it into that crease as well
just kind of I put it a little bit up
here too because I like that you guys
know that I like that but I'm just
lightly running that through the crease
to keep that purple look I'm gonna go
back in again with the color underhand
and put that all over the lid again just
because I feel like we've lost some of
that pigmentation on the lid and it's a
really pretty color I don't want it to
look like it's been all my eyes for like
seven days and then I'm showing you the
look and again I'm gonna add a little
bit of that darker color too and I'm
gonna go back in and blend again with
that bitter color I know it's a lot of
the same crap but that's how I'm doing
it and I'm mostly just gonna focus it on
the outer portion there is so much fun I
don't know if you guys can see it but
it's pretty intense
okay and I'm just gonna blend the edges
hope I can speed this up so you guys
don't have to sit through so much I'm
just gonna using this to wipe away any
fallout cuz I just can't do it now that
I have that done I'm gonna go in and
let's use oh I have that dark shade huh
mmm I guess I could have used that but
I'm not okay so now I'm gonna go in and
I am going to use the teal shitty and
I'm going to be putting that all on my
inner corner and I'm gonna bring it down
the lower lash line and kind of fade it
this way quite bright I want it to be
like this
standout type of thing I'm gonna be
using just a flat shader brush this game
in the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette and
I'm just going to be putting that all
over my inner corner okay yeah that's
what I'm talking about this is kind of a
crazy look I know a lot of you guys
would never wear this I'm not even sure
if I would we're just gonna kind of just
a little bit blend of that and and I'm
gonna take the other side it's like a
bloody side and just kind of blend with
that 1985 color into that purple into
the blue what am I saying
part of the reason I did what I did
there so I really want to add like a
foiled silver bright silver in the
center of even that like so it's kind of
radiating
I don't know if I have one of those
colors to use but that's what I wanted
to do so let's see I'm gonna take this
is the lorac mega Pro one sorry if you
can't get it just any type of it's just
what's near me right now honestly so
anything that's like a really light
white shimmery color you're just gonna
kind of put it on top of that I just
don't want it to look so dark so that's
kind of my way to combat that I don't
know if it's gonna work I mean it looks
pretty good okay I feel like I look so
crazy now let's do the under eye I
probably should wait actually I'm gonna
do let me do my concealer and I'll be
back and then we'll go into the lender
lashline which I'll finish up using that
dark brown color and the I look will be
more finished so let me do that okay hi
guys I did a lot of off of camera so I
bronze up my face I added a little bit
more powder to my brows and set them
with some clear brow gel
I added liner I added mascara to my top
lashes and yeah tight lined with a black
liner as well so let's get back to doing
the bottom of the lash line that's the
last thing I have one color to use left
it's the dark brown that shouldn't be
too hard so I'm gonna go in with my
favorite you guys know this short little
smudgy type of brush I'm gonna go in
with that shade which is called delete
I'm just gonna put that the tiniest
amount like I'm basically just doing
this to say I used it so not a time the
tiniest bit and I'm gonna just kind of
connect the wing with that color I don't
normally do a wing but I just felt like
to kind of ground this look a little bit
more I would do one now that we have
that done I really want to warm up the
lower lash line and kind of add some
more warmth to my look so that's what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna take the color
rule by Mac that is this one here so
I've already used all the five I have to
use now I can have fun do whatever I
want thank goodness right
gonna put that where these two connect
you probably could use the color bitter
actually and get a similar effect this
one's just not as dark as bitter I just
really want you guys know I really like
a warm type of eye so I just wanted a
little more warmth I built that color up
quite a bit I don't like that so now I'm
gonna go in and I'm gonna go in with
just this is another one from one of the
Urban Decay palette I'm gonna go in with
this 1985 color and I'm gonna use that
to kind of like blend this out and just
kind of have a more cohesive kind of a
look because it's already been used in
the look and this you can take a little
bit lower than the orange and just to
make that orange pop a little bit more
I'm gonna go in the outside where we put
mostly the color bitter I'm gonna go in
and just like kind of lightly that
orange I'm gonna go back in with the
aqua color on this little brush and just
kind of pop it out a little bit because
I've blended the concealer I feel like
it looks a little unnatural not that T
on your inner corner looks very natural
but and then once again I'm going to go
in with a smaller type of shade and add
that white to the very middle just to
make sure it still looks definitely the
brightest in the middle of my tear duct
even though we have that teal color yeah
like that and I do our that want lunch
so I'm gonna add even more of that rule
color and really just pack it in I'm
using even a bigger kind of fluffy brush
just to really lay that color on there
yeah see I just like that way better
just more intense I'm gonna add some
mascara to my bottom lashes I'm also
gonna pop a little bit of white liner in
the waterline and then I think this look
will be done I'll be back hold on okay
so that is the final look with
everything done I feel pretty good about
this look those are the colors I had to
use that's what it finally looks
like there this was definitely a
challenge these are not colors I would
have probably ever put together it
definitely made me like go out of my
comfort zone get a little creative I
definitely think it's nice to be able to
add other shades to the look to really
just like pop certain things or just
enhance what you maybe already have
going but you kind of on that yeah
enhance like that bitter shade is a nice
warm brown but I really wanted that
extra move of orange so it helped to be
able to bring in the rural shadow format
but anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I definitely want to do more I
think so let me know if you want to see
more or if you're gonna try it out try
it it's fun you don't have to go out if
you don't want to but I don't know I
don't think it looks I don't think it
looks like bad you know and I kind of
like that I did the perp or the blue in
an unexpected way instead of just like
on the lid I don't know I'm pretty happy
with it I don't know I think these were
kind of hard colors these are definitely
dark and cool and not me so I mean I
still made it warm cuz lord knows I'm
gonna make it warm if I can but anyway
that's everything for this video I hope
you guys enjoyed and I will see you in
the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
