learned thank you so much for watching
I'm going to be doing another beauty tag
today because I just really have been
enjoying doing them so this is going to
be the palette recommendation tag this
was created by Kaylee belt I believe
that's how you pronounce it she used to
be known as hello Kaylee here on YouTube
she made this quite a while ago but I
was looking back through and in my head
I was like okay Lee came up with one I
want to do that one and that was like
nine months ago or something crazy and I
don't know how I let time get away from
me that much but I'm here to do today if
you don't know she does a ton of videos
on palettes she's loved a shadow
palettes I love eyeshadow palettes and I
thought it would be fun to talk about my
recommendation I will leave a link to
her channel down below if you want to go
check her out and we'll get into the
video but the first question is the best
talent for beginners or the palette that
I recommend for beginners and for that I
chose the Stila soul palette this is
something I know talked a lot about on
my channel I have it in my kit right now
but I think they'll see colors in here
are just very basic and I think that
someone who's just getting into makeup
or someone who doesn't have a lot of
makeup would get so much use out of this
this has their classic shade kitten
which is just such a popular shade it's
just a nice champagne nothing in here is
too warm or too cool has nice neutrals
in it I just think someone would get so
much use out of this and it'd be perfect
for a beginner's palette and the biggest
thing for me that separates this from
the Too Faced chocolate bar which I
personally do not like and the Naked
palette which I think is great but it
doesn't have enough mass in it and this
one has one two three four five Maps all
in the perfect shape it has a matte
cream two different transitions one's
cool and one's a little bit warmer a
nice dark brown and then a matte black
so I think you could just definitely get
wearable everyday looks at this and have
everything you need to create a really
good eye work when I was going through
my collection I realized that I have not
tried out that many of the drugstore
palettes which is the next question the
best drugstore palette I just feel like
there's so expensive so many of them are
like so similar Thai and prices that I'm
like I might as well get something
high-end but I did find something that I
just think I would recommend I think
this is a great palette and
super inexpensive this is the
wet-and-wild walking on eggshells now
this is just a trio it's not some
massive palette but the colors in here
are so pretty
sadly it doesn't have a mat in it but
every single one of these shades would
be so pretty all over the lid I feel
like these are shades that we look for
in love and other brands this here is
the Cree shade it looks almost exactly
the same as kitten this is such a nice
shimmery color and then this almost
looks like wood wink to me from Mac so
these are just such good quality shadows
for such a great price and their colors
that people actually wear every day and
next is the best palette for work or
school now I'm thinking things that I
feel like I could suggest to other
people look at me I look like a French
harlot right now so I do whatever I want
and this is wearable to me because I can
wear it on my face so therefore I can
wear it outside of my house but I know
that not everyone's like that so for
work in school I went with something
that is very basic and I think a lot of
people would get a lot of use out of
this is the Naked basics palette from
Urban Decay it's just the original you
could also go with the Naked basics too
but I don't have it these are almost on
that shades and then it has one nice
shimmery shade called Venus this is just
so great you can use it in eyebrows you
can use it in the crease it's great for
everyday it looks you can do something
smoky if you really wanted to for
somebody just need to hurry through some
makeup on maybe just find their eyes a
little bit this is a really great
palette and I want to say right now too
you could obviously switch these
palettes up in different places it just
wouldn't be fun if I just said oh this
could also fit here or pick the same
palette for everything so you know I
love all of these equally and they could
easily fit into other categories next is
the best palette for a natural way to
play with color um once again I'm no
stranger to color I like color I think
it's really fun but I picked two
palettes that I think maybe other people
could enjoy but still have some color to
them the more neutral one out of the two
is the Too Faced peanut butter and jelly
palette now I really like this palette I
think it's really great has some really
nice warm orange shades but then it has
that pop of purple so if you're looking
for something kind of fun you can do
something but it's not you could
definitely get something more neutral
and just warm toned it has a nice gold
in it
really like this palette it's super good
it's small and compact it's cute I like
it and then the other palette which I
think you might still be able to get is
from Joseph colors and this is the ice
cream palette now when you first look at
it it looks like what that's a ton of
color but there really are only one two
three four bright shades the rest are
very wearable so I really think this one
would be great if you're looking for
some fun pops of color but don't want to
always have to rest on those they have a
matte cream shade which is great they
have a matte crease color a dark matte
color and then two nice shimmery shades
and then they have a matte berry like so
good love this palette I love the
composition of it I love the colors that
they put in here I think it works really
well and I think you could do a pop of
color or go neutral and safe and you
would like either look number five we're
halfway through the palette what is the
biggest bang for your buck and I went
with a color pop palette now I hate that
you guys can't get your hands on this at
the moment it's sold out but I think
that this is just such a good quality
and for the price it's amazing so this
is the cute AAS palette but it really
should be called the Messier s palette
because look at this mine is so dirty
this is just from natural wear and tear
of using it what I love about this the
most and what kind of put it over the
edge for getting the biggest bang for
your buck is you get to try out some
really great pigmented shadows in a
bunch of different finishes and in such
trendy colors but you don't have to pay
an arm or leg we all know that this is
very similar to the Natasha Genoa
palette and I think it's great that you
can try those trends out and not have to
spend so much money
think about L'Oreal their lapel is are
$20 at the drugstore and this is 16 this
is cheaper than that and you're getting
super pigmented shadows and you're
getting masks like I just think this is
so good the next two questions how kind
of like specific meanings to whoever is
talking about it so number six is the
best palette for pale skin and I went
with the Too Faced natural matte palette
this is an on that palette as you can
tell I really like them this obviously
was in the running for the best work
palette the best beginner palette
but I really feel like this is best
suited for lighter skin tones the
darkest shade is this one here called
sex press oh and it's not that dark
especially if you have a darker skin
tone you would need something like a
black or oh okay you will need something
like a black or a almost black color to
really get the definition in darkness so
I think this is best suited for lighter
skin tones but if you are a lighter skin
tone this is a really great palette and
I have been really loving it
next is the best palette for blue eyes
because I have blue eyes so blue eyes
look great with orange colors think of
anything across the color wheel and
instead of boring with the modern
Renaissance which would be the obvious
pick I saved that for a different
question I decided to go with the violet
boss palette I don't hear anyone talk
about this really anymore but it is so
good I was so skeptical about this
palette because of the fact that I know
everyone was hyping it up and it was
like an unknown brand and blah blah blah
but this is really good the pigmentation
is absolutely stunning they feel so
creamy and soft has a great composition
of mass and shimmers I love it it has a
nice orange here it also has the red
challenge but those look so good on blue
eyes they really make them pop and I
highly suggest this palette I think it's
really good I think I say that at the
end Emily wha-wha-wha
and i really suggest this palette i
think it's really good next we are
talking about the best all in one
palette the palette that does it all
that i feel like would work for everyone
has everything you need you don't need
to reach for outside stuff I'm really
sorry about whatever is happening
outside and I'm going with the lorac Pro
palette I love these and I'm putting all
three of them in here because you can
kind of pick the color preference that
works for you the black one obviously is
the original but what I think makes this
the best all in one palette is that half
of them are masked half of them are
shimmers there are so many different
colors in here and finishes that no
matter what the situation you could
definitely create a look with one of
these palettes I know some people have
panned them so I don't know how you guys
feel about them if you were wondering
which one to get I probably would just
suggest the original but if you are fair
or like a lighter look I think that the
pro 3 is really nice
there's one chunky shade in here that I
don't like I believe it's called
medallion and then the other one the
lorac pro 2 which is dubbed the cool
tone palette which does definitely have
cool tones is really beautiful as well
light brown is so pretty nectars
beautiful Rose a mocha beige I mean it
has some fun pops of color as well so I
really highly suggest these I love the
formula of the lorac shadows as well
these are just really good great
all-in-one palettes number nine is best
for travel and I went with a palette
that I have traveled with and I really
like that is the modern renaissance you
guessed it this is a really warm toned
palette you guys are seeing this a
million times I love that most of the
shades in here are math I could bring
this on vacation with me and get ton of
different looks whatever I'm feeling out
of this one palette and I love that so
for me if I don't want to bring a bunch
of stuff with me I can just bring this
palette get any look I want even if I
want to do something fun and like crazy
I can do it with this if I want
something super simple and just like
classic I can do it with this I love it
and last is the palette that you don't
recommend and I don't have any palettes
that they don't recommend really in my
collection so the only one I can think
of and you guys already know this I hate
the lorac from French palette I've rag
down that palette so many times but I
really hate that palette I returned it I
don't suggest it but it's limited
edition and depending on when you're
watching this video you probably can't
get it so thank goodness limited edition
is working out for us for once that is
everything thank you so much for
watching guys let me know what some of
your favorite palettes are down below I
would love to see them and if you want
to do this tag I definitely suggest it
it's super fun to go through your
collection and kind of think about how
you would answer these questions if
someone was asking you anyway that's
everything thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
