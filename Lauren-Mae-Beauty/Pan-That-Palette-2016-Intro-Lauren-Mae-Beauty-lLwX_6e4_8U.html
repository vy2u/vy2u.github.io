this is going to be my official intro to
pan that palette 2016 as you guys know
if you've seen my thousand eyeshadows
video which I'll link down below if you
haven't I am being a little
non-traditional when it comes to panning
my palette instead of focusing on one
palette throughout the year I have
decided to pan as many eyeshadows in my
collection as possible Michael has hit
pan on 25 eyes shadows at least this
year because it's not like one palette
it's going to be a little bit different
and update so I thought I would just
show you guys the palettes I'm going to
be working on and a few other decisions
I've made since I made that video and
just kind of give you this intro and
then I'll update you monthly on where
I'm at what shadows I've hit pan on and
all of that
the first palette that I've been
focusing on probably the most so far is
the lavish palette by Anastasia I
already hit pan on orange soda this
shade before I started this so that
doesn't technically count for this month
but I am focusing on the color cream I'm
using it to set my entire eye area after
I put a base down so I'm hoping to I
think I can hit pan on that by the next
update I think that that's definitely
possible since I'm using it on such a
wide area I'm also going to be focusing
on like the colors that I potentially
could use from this palette are also
antique and rum cake Moss is pretty but
I don't know I mean I could probably at
least hit pan throughout the year
truffle is really pretty I have that in
my outer like V today to darken up my
crease and then pink sapphire is
beautiful I think I'm going to do like
an all-over really pretty burgundy type
of eye look and then I love the color
Sienna
I love blending things out with that
color it's beautiful I don't think that
I will be using ballet or black diamond
at all they have so much glitter in them
that I just don't think it's worth it so
I don't think that I will even try to
pan those eyeshadows or use those
eyeshadows at all I'd rather just use
other things that's just where I stand
at this point but I just don't like when
things have a ton of like loose glitter
in them
and it just falls all over your face I
do my eye shadow after I do my
foundation so that is like extremely
annoying to me anyway specifically I
would like to hit pan and cream and make
a pretty good dent on Sienna other than
that I want to use other things in here
probably focus on antique a little bit
but yeah all the shades but those are
kind of the ones I'm looking at to like
use use this month I'm also throwing
this one in here this is the Smashbox
blue eyes palette this just has a lot of
great shades in it I'm going to be using
this kind of orange e shade it's a matte
shade kind of in a replacement of orange
soda and try to hit pan on that and just
use a lot of these this is a nice matte
Brown as well if I want a lighter color
than antique this is a nice kind of cool
tone color to put on the lid I just
thought that these two palettes would
pair nicely together and I can kind of
be working on those two this month and
see how it goes where I go with that and
update you guys and in addition to those
two palettes I'm just gonna bring this
with me like when I go out of town as
well as just kind of have it on my
vanity because it just has other colors
in it that I might not have in these
palettes like if I want to do some
purple or have some Pink's or just other
colors that I might not have in there I
can have this palette and reach for it
too I think that at some point this year
this will be a big focus of mine just
using up some of my Coastal Scents
shadows and like single shadows that
maybe I've neglected in the past so it's
kind of like a combination of all three
of these palettes and I'm going to be
working on in the next month or so so
I'm excited to update you guys on these
when I get there at the end of January
and again like I said we'll just do
updates every month I'll give you guys
some goals I'm kind of setting for
myself for what palettes I think I'm
going to focus on and we'll see where my
progress goes by the end of the month
real quick a couple things that I've
kind of changed my mind about this
palette the kat von d palette I am going
to actually get rid of this I tried
using this a couple times I dug into the
shade and a couple other shades and
honestly they're just not that great on
I think they would look really nice if
you use like a mac fix+ or something but
I have so many shades I just don't think
it's worth it and I'm glad that I gave
this a chance and a couple times did use
it but I don't think it's worth it also
it has one of those shades this pink one
that is exactly like the one in the
lavish palette that I don't want to use
because of the glitter it's a light pink
matte color with a ton of glitter just
thrown in it and I put it on my hand and
then blended it out with like a brush
and put on the brush and blend it out
and glitter flew everywhere so I know
that if I use that on my eyes it would
just be like whoa all over my face and
crazy which I love my glitter but I
don't like when it looks like a mistake
I'm gonna actually pass this along
because I don't need it and it's another
palette out of my collection that's
crazy but I'm glad that it's because I
tried it and decided I didn't want to
use it so just thought I'd let you guys
know that that will not be a part of me
panning shadows and it's because it's
just the quality on the actual eye is
not what I want its watches nicely but
it doesn't quite transfer the same on
the eyes and the last thing that I
changed I decided to not officially pan
a blush palette this year I was kind of
dabbing around like I did with that
palette but in my blushes and the Tarte
palette is very pigmented it's kind of
difficult to use I haven't used it a ton
and it's quite difficult so that one I
just I know I'm not gonna make a ton of
progress in it and I I don't know I
think because I was trying to kind of
limit myself to a couple palettes I also
was trying to Eve pearl palette and
although that is a really pretty color I
just kind of want the freedom to use the
blushes in my collection and I think
that kind of again similar to the kat
von d palette I think I'm gonna be able
to weed out a lot of blushes that just
don't work for me or that I don't want
to deal with whether the pigmentations
poor or because the pigmentation is so
strong that it's hard to work with or
whatever I think it'll be a good year
for me to use up a lot of stuff try to
use up maybe every one of my blushes at
least once so that way I can see what I
really like
and yeah I don't even know I've been
using that one blush the laura geller
blush from my project pan roulette for
so long that i really haven't had to
like think about picking out a blush
every day and it's been kind of fun and
been kind of like eye opening to know
what blushes I've really been enjoying
which ones I'm like oh I know I don't
know if I like love this
so anyway thought I'd update you and
this is my official intro I'm so excited
to be finally doing a pan that palette
video I've been watching these for so
long and I didn't do them this year when
I started making videos but I'm excited
to start this year off with them so I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
