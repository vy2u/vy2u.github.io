much for watching this is going to be my
pan that palette update I don't even
know what update to send so whatever the
title says that's where we're at
I'm just gonna get straight into it
because I want to be super sweet and
short into the point I will show you
guys a picture of what my palette looked
like last month or like the progression
of where it got from the beginning up
until the month before and I'll show you
the Sun
you
and this is what my palette looks like
now not a time to change but I did hit
pan in Peach Smoothie from makeup geek
so another pan down so I have a total of
eight shadows with pana in this palette
others in Peach Smoothie I really was
kind of low over the place I used some
of cupcake I'm out of time
my biggest shadow I probably use the
most was the color soft brown for Mac
it's kind of like my go-to crease shades
since I hit pan Inez and I have pan on
frappe or creme brulee I really like it
it's what I have in my crease today but
I know that one's going to take a lot of
time to use up so I'm just kind of
working on it now I also use antique and
wood linked from Mac quite a bit too
I don't know what turnout at the max
month I use desert sands a couple of
times I'm so close to ending pan on that
if I really tried I could do it in a
month and that's kind of it on this one
I use chickadee a little bit too I'm
trying but not a ton of progress so this
one's I think was you know successful
because I hit pan in something but a
little slow moving a lot of it is just
I'm working on stuff and it's just not
close enough to hit pan yet so next
month I'm really going to focus on using
the soft brown I'd like to just keep
making a dent in it I kind of want to
try to start using this color here I
think it's peddle teach from Coastal
Scents and just hopefully get that one
to get some pan in it soon
and I think desert sands this is like
this rate I really want to try to use as
much as possible others are not just
trying to use this palette you know as
my main focus would be awesome not too
many goals if somebody gets you bored
with this palette and that kind of
brings me to the companion palette that
I chose for this month and that was the
lorac unzipped palette now this used to
be one of my favorite palettes and I
talk about this a lot in comparison to
you can make it three and say I like
this one better than the naked 3 um
because it has like rosy tone and my
taste has just changed so much I don't
really I don't know how I feel about
this palette I'm wearing it today I'm
wearing unattainable just all over the
eyelid
that's a one shadow look and I am
wearing this color here this is the one
I use the most because it's just like
I'm matte cream color I love shades like
this to put it on the brow bone all over
the lid you know you know how we do
but these mats here I thought blended
out horribly so I used unconditional one
day and I never used it again because I
was like I don't have time for that bull
crap
um I don't know I just don't really love
the formula of this some of them are
nice if you like your finger like that
looks so pretty
but I don't know it just it's not as
nice as I remembered which is crazy and
also too I just realized I love color so
much more than what this palette gives
for some people this is crazy you know
this is like rows each on something a
little different Tamiya is still boring
like this is like this is just clamp
like straight up neutral there is
nothing like pink to me about this this
is like what pink is like hot pink you
guys know I like hot pink you know so
this just isn't enough color for me and
my everyday life like I just get a
little bored with this so I mean I like
this palette issues on a one palette
like a one palette for me I can use
unattainable when I want like that one
shadow look that's like the one good
thing that came out of this is that I've
discovered my love for just like one
shadow I really liked putting
unattainable or antiques for Mac no 91
wings for Mac all over my lid I just
think it's a really pretty sultry easy
look but you know creating looks with
this it's not my favorite and in this
color unbridled this is just it's not it
doesn't have enough red in it for me it
just it doesn't have to have like warmth
or anything I don't know it's okay I can
see why maybe some people would like
this but I'm realizing that my case
they're outgrowing this palette and
personally I don't love the formula of
the maps in here so yeah I don't think
I'm not going to get rid of it because I
don't hate it that much at least not
right now in my collection but it's not
one that I necessarily suggest it
definitely wouldn't be my top anything
so actually I forgot to pick out a new
palette for my companion palette this
month so let me go pick one out and I
will be right back guys okay guys I'm
back I decided to pick the honest
obvious tamanna' palette and yeah I'm
excited
this one has some neutrals some climate
bright colors this color sangria is
really pretty
so it's China rose so just something a
little bit more like to me this is so
much more my style I know that Stephanie
from the daisy girly is panning this
this year so I'm going to check out some
of her older videos and just maybe get
some inspiration from those I think even
guilded would be such a pretty one
shadow look like all over the eyes so so
beautiful that is there so I'm excited
to use this the quality of this palette
is amazing and honestly I just have not
gotten any use out of it that I showed
up so hopefully I just have a feeling I
will like this so much more than the
lorac because the formula just is better
I personally like the lorac Pro formula
better than the one in the unzipped
palette so I'm excited to treat myself
to a really nice I try to formula this
month that is everything for my pan that
palette update guys thanks so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
