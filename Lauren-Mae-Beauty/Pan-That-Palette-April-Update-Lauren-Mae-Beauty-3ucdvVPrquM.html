Lauren this is going to be my pan that
palette update for April I was able to
hit pan on three different eyeshadows
one is like not cheating but a little
bit different so we'll get into that and
then I have had a few comments about
like wanting to see all my eyeshadows as
a whole so I'm not gonna film that in
this group of videos but I will be
filming that soon so you guys can just
see like just straight up this eyeshadow
as I've hit pan on for the year I like a
little update or something on that oh my
gosh my out of breath what break so
let's get started on the eyeshadows I
hit pan on and we'll move on from there
I basically hit pan on the couple of
white shadows I was wanting to this
month which is exciting I'm just glad to
like get done with them I was kind of
working on them for a while so the first
one here is from the anasazi beverly
hills of miami appellate and it is the
shade caramel you can see the pan that's
right there in the middle I really like
this shade is a transition shade I kind
of actually miss it I feel like this
month has been a month where I've done
like something more different than I
ever have in the other months so far
this year with my eyeshadows and I've
just been kind of switching around a lot
more before I was super focused I'd like
use the same shades every single day and
I kind of miss doing that I mean I like
jumping around and doing what I want but
it's nice just knowing what I want to do
but I think with my hair being pink
sometimes I like to switch it up and I
just feel like not everything goes as
much and anyway I don't know I've just
noticed that but I did hit pan on
caramel what a wonderful feeling the
next time I hit pan on is just this
little one from SMH and this is a color
called squeak I use just has a face
highlight I know it's kind of hard to
see so I'm sorry but you can definitely
see the pan and this one I have quite a
bit of pan and also half of the pan is
quite shallow so I really used this more
evenly it's not like I just burrowed
down deep I was using this with a bigger
brush because again it was on my face
and I wasn't using like a little shader
brush
I enjoyed using this when I was I was
getting a little tired at the end but
overall I thought this looked really
pretty now I'm just going to retire it
for a while and use other things because
yeah why not I'm gonna try
hit a shadows can't handle this cuz I
can't speak
hopefully the Lighting's on two
different and all my videos but I kind
of had a few issues I feel like my last
videos have been a little dark so now
I'm trying to make them brighter and
change stuff
why can't lighting be easy anyway I'm
trying to hit pan on as many eyeshadows
as possible this year so that is why I'm
once I hit pan I'm just kind of like
moving on to the next one and then the
surprised one and kind of like not a
cheat one but you know a little bit
different is from my lorac mega pro 2
and it is the shade espresso and right
there you can see the pan the reason I'm
calling this kind of a cheat one is
because I don't use this for myself I
use this in my kit and so I use that on
other people I like to use this as
basically in everything shade I use it
for eyebrows I use a fur liner I use it
for the crease color like I use it for
so many things and that's when I hit pan
on it I really enjoy this palette in my
kit because it offers just like a
perfect neutral selection and then since
there's so many mattes I can also like
if I need to just do men's grooming I
can kind of fill in eyebrows and beards
and do whatever I gotta do so anyway I
did hit pan on that and I am going to
count it because I did count this in my
thousand eyeshadows video so I think it
makes sense for me to count it as
hitting pan even if I haven't been
hitting it with my own makeup I don't
know anyway and then just a few updates
on some of the shadows that I was
working on last month so I wanted to
work on the lorac palettes really I only
focused on lorac 2 palette so snow has a
bit of a dip going it's really hard to
see but it does have a bit of a dip buff
has pretty big of a dip going as well
and I did use nectar quite a few times
and I started using light brown which is
something I've never done before so it's
kind of hard to see progress again
because the lights and I apologize but I
did not hit pan on anything another
shadow I was working on was from the
peanut butter and jelly palette from Too
Faced and you can see the dent there
it's in the shade bananas and I have not
hit pan on that yet but I did use it a
couple more times this month I think I
made even more progress on it which is
awesome no pan yet though and really the
last shadow I want to
I made progress on is this one from
two-face it's in the shape leading lady
you can see it just definitely has like
hardpan and like chunks in it it's one
of my favorite shadow so I do love this
and I'm gonna use it up but it
definitely is kind of weird so I'm using
this and I did use this quite a few
times last month so I'm happy that I was
making progress but I did not obviously
hit pan so now on to my focus is for the
month of May for May I
wooh I want to focus on buff and I want
to hit pan on buff so I'm just gonna use
that every single day as my like base
shade and I definitely think I can hit
pan on that I'm surprised I haven't yet
so I think that one will definitely be
doable and then I also just want to
focus on the color snow and hit pan on
it I'm wearing snow is an inner corner
highlight today I just really have been
liking that super stark super white
shimmery highlight on the inner corner
it's just like this is like a sweeter
look for me today I just have really
been enjoying it so I definitely want to
hit pan on that next month and I think I
can if I just keep using it I use like a
domed like a little bit fluffier of a
pencil brush so I definitely think
because these are really soft shadows
and because I'm just kind of focusing on
one area I can do those I also want to
focus on hitting pan on bananas again so
anytime I want to use like a gold shade
or switch it up without like a light
shimmery shade or a matte shade on the
lid I want to use bananas and maybe I
can hit pan I don't know how deep the
pans are on these so we'll see about
that but I do want to continue to focus
on bananas and then this is my Z palette
which has basically makeup geek shades a
couple Mac sheets and then some Coastal
Scents shades in it and I want to
continue to work on my Too Faced leading
lady which is a different size pan than
all the others I do want to continue
focusing on that but I'm out of these I
also want to focus on desert sands and
use that as like my transition color all
month and then I kind of want to focus
on like soft brown and rule so basically
all three of those as like transition
type of shades I think that would be
really nice see if I can make some dents
in them and then once I hit pan on buff
I want to use these two shades from
Coastal Scents one is in the color and
zero one it's like a matte white shade
and the other one is the color sham wah
ShamWow
it's like a French word I like to mix
the two this one's not light enough for
me but when I mix them this is too light
so when I mix them together they just
make a really nice base shade for me so
once I hit pan on buff I'll focus on
those two yeah I think that's everything
I wasn't gonna take pictures of this
stuff but I don't think I'm going to if
I'm just being honest with you guys I'm
sorry maybe one day I'll get there but
I'm too lazy today to do that so I'm
sorry but I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day I hope your project pans
and your pan that pallets are going
really well
that's everything I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I'll see you
in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
