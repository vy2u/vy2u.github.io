it's Lauren this is going to be my pan
that palette update for the month of
February so I had some specific goals
I'm kind of getting a better system down
for how I'm going to be panning all the
eyeshadows that I want to this year that
is what I'm doing I'm not taking one
palette but instead I am trying to just
hit pan on as many eyeshadows in my
collection as possible we all know I
have way too many and a lot of them have
never seen either any use or enough use
to really be considered used or loved so
let me get into what I hit pan on first
for the month of February or during the
month of February I am so happy I think
I hit pan on five different eyeshadow
shades kind of crazy definitely a really
big jump from the month before I only
hit two so super excited let's get into
that progress the first one I'm going to
show you here this is actually kind of a
cheat one but it's also not so as you
can see the black shade on the top here
has a ton of pan on it that is because I
actually used that shade to tint some
hair gel black because of a look I was
doing for school I wanted to be kind of
this it didn't work out but I want it to
be my edge
I wanted to be this kind of like
creature from Black Lagoon but like more
sexy and like have my hair like gelled
back and kind of like have the gel with
tons of glitter dripping down my face on
the sides and like have this whole I had
this whole vision for sure so I made the
gel with this and a ton of my glitter
and I love the gel itself the gel worked
but you know the masks and all that
anyway we won't get into it I did use it
that way and honestly as much as I
didn't use this on my face or anything I
do think it's a really awesome success
in the sense that instead of finding or
going out and buying something to tint
my hair gel black I was creative and
found something that I already had in my
collection to make my project work for
me so I think that is awesome and
although it wasn't used like I didn't do
like 10 million smokey eyes I did
pan on that and I'm going to count that
as a shadow I hit pan on next is a
shadow from my Smashbox blue eyes
palette and it is the shade custard
there you can see the pan I did post a
picture of me hitting pan on this on my
Instagram so a lot of you guys already
knew this this was really early on in
the month I almost forgot I hit pan on
it because it's been so long and I'm
going to just continue anymore use on
this palette at least for now I just I
don't really like this palette we all
know this I'm not going to go back into
it but I am glad to have at least hit
pan on one of the shades in here and
kind of realize that I don't like it I
think that's a really again kind of good
lesson to learn from panning your
collection is realizing the things you
don't like and if you're using it and
you have all the set of stuff to kind of
not use it or get rid of it or pass it
along because it's not working for you
and why why life is too short so anyway
hit pan on that one really excited about
that
for the record I'm really excited about
all of them so this is my steal a mind
palette and I was working on the shade
reason as you can see I did hit pan on
this one this one I was not sure I was
going to but kind of like at the last
moment hit pan and I'm really happy with
that progress this is just a light cream
shade so honestly I will probably hit
pan on a ton of light cream matte shades
this month or I mean this year because I
do use a really big brush and I put it
from like my lash line all the way up to
my brow bone to set my primer so that I
have a really nice base to blend on
therefore I will go through a lot of it
but it is so nice to see this palette
have some use it's crazy what pan makes
you feel like like you feel just so
excited to use your products alright in
my last two shades that I hit pan on are
both in my aqua lilies from Tarte
palette so I did hit pan on parasol
there I was using this as a face
highlight as well as an inner corner
highlight and then I did hit pan on the
light brown shade as well which is super
exciting that one I also did not think
I'd actually hit pan on and a
these aren't like the biggest amounts of
pan but I definitely think that they're
sizable especially for what I'm trying
to do this year so I am super happy
about that I can't believe that this
palette you know from going basically
from the beginning of the year to having
no use to now having pan and two of the
eyeshadows is amazing and I just makes
me feel better about having this palette
in my collection still about buying this
palette in the first place and that's
exciting my mom even is like what's that
palette you showed I want that palette
like it's limited edition I can't sorry
like you can't get it now so um but
anyway I don't know why I said that just
a little story really happy with my
progress on this one and I think I am
going to kind of retire this palette and
put it away because I'm kind of okay
with where I'm at so far I'm progress on
this and then I'm gonna just work on
other things in my collection to kind of
get a more overall use and I kind of was
thinking after using this one like if I
can hit pan on two shadows and every one
of my palettes I think that would be
really really awesome so I'm kind of
thinking about doing that as we go into
the year that is everything that I hit
pan on so I'm going to show you some
progress as well as the I think I picked
five eyeshadows to kind of focus in on
this month I'm really only picking five
because I did just get the peanut butter
and jelly palette from Too Faced and I
want to be able to explore with that I'm
excited to do some looks
I've been going kind of neutral lately
but I want to be able to play around
with color and different things if I
want to so let me show you the shadows
that I'm going to be working on in the
month of March hopefully I can hit pan
on two of these shades will see as the
month goes along the first shadows that
I am going to be working on are these
two here this one is squeak and I am
using that as an all-over face highlight
as well as like an inner corner
highlight and just any time I need like
a light shimmery shade I'm kind of
gravitating toward that this one is
packed really really hard compared to
the rest of the shadows so I'm not sure
if I'm gonna be able to hit pan on that
but I do want to make some progress in
it so that hopefully in the month of
April I can hit pan on it and then this
one is another one I'm working on this
is the color cracker from SM H these are
all from SM H stars makeup Haven but I
want to hit pan on that I definitely
think I'm gonna do that I already have a
sizable dent going on in this it is such
a soft shadow
that my brush just picks up a lot of it
and it's so creamy definitely my
favorite cream shadow I've worked with
this year to use for my lash line to my
brow bone definitely my favorite it just
is so creamy so nice I really like it I
kinda want to be adventurous this is me
just talking right now to you not part
of my plan but I kind of want to see if
I can like burrow down in this shadow
and hit pan I am like absolutely loving
this lime green I'm so glad I did that
rehaul video because it made me pull
these out talk about them with you guys
and just reminded me like hey Lauren
you've never used this and you bought it
for a reason and I freaking love it I
think it looks so pretty I think it
looks really good with the Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette which is
what I'm wearing on the rest of my eyes
and then I have that pop I love it and
if I wanted to go more neutral I could
just do like just a neutral brown on the
bottom lashline but to me I would wear
this out you know you know how I do
those are kind of what I'm focusing on
in this palette and hopefully it can
make some good progress and see what I
can do this is my Stila countless color
pigment in indie and I don't know if you
can tell but right here this is actually
like a pretty good dent I really just
want to hit pan on this so I'm gonna be
trying to just hit pan on this I just
kind of want to see that progress in it
it's a nice shadow it's not one of my
favorite shadows ever but I'm gonna just
you know use it in my brows if I can use
it to smoke out my lower lashline yeah I
just want to try to hit pan on this one
just to do it just to say I did it and
be done with it and really there's only
two more shadows and I really want to
work on so this is the Anasazi Beverly
Hills Miah Miah palette and I have been
working on caramel it's kind of hard to
see a dent but I have been making a dent
in this shade and I have been really
liking it it's a really good transition
shade I will probably go through a lot
of these like mid-tone warm brown shades
as transition shades this year as well
but I really have been enjoying this one
again I don't know if I'm gonna hit pan
on this because I do have the peanut
butter and jelly palette now and I know
I'm gonna want to use it so we shall see
but I think that I'm gonna try to focus
on this one before I go too much into
that one just to kind of have the
satisfaction of hitting pan on this in
this palette this month and last I want
to continue
to focus on Siena this is it there you
can see better progress in it than
before so I just want to work on that
there is a shade in the peanut butter
and jelly palette that is similar but it
is brighter than Siena this is
definitely a just a bit deeper and more
Brown and not so orange so I do think
that I'll be able to use that palette
and this one so I'm going to throw it in
here plus if I need something this color
I'm just gonna reach for this one if I
can this month so I really just want to
see pan in this because I'll have then
three shadows with pan which would be
absolutely amazing and that's my update
guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I hope it's inspiring you guys to use up
your shadows I'm telling you if you just
use a shadow every single day use it
every single day for a month and just
see how far you can get you can really
see some awesome progress so I will see
you guys in my next video I hope you're
having a wonderful day and I'll talk to
you then
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
