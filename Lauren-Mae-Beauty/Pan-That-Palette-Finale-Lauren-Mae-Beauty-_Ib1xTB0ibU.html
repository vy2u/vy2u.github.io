Lauren thank you so much for watching
I'm finally addressing my pan that
palette because I haven't uploaded an
update in forever and the reason I
haven't uploaded for a long time
regarding my pan that palette for the
year was because I wasn't using it I had
no new progress so I just thought it
would be so repetitive and I kind of
gave myself a month off and then that
turned into two month and I don't even
know where I'm at now from when I last
uploaded a update so I'm going to call
it quits guys I'm calling it I feel bad
I feel weird I don't think I'd really
quit a pan that palette or a project to
really like this maybe I haven't I'm
just like totally basing on it but
honestly where I'm out right now is I
just want to use the shadows of my
collection regardless of whether or not
they're in this palette and I have a lot
of pressure to like hit pan that's my
goal if you guys didn't know I wanted to
hit pan on every shadow in my Z palette
this is my everyday kind of life palette
and I was really going for it I did a
pretty good job I definitely have some
more pan in here than I originally had
which i think is amazing but I'm I just
don't want to force myself to use this I
don't want to use colors I don't want to
although I really do like the shades in
here this is not what I'm gravitating to
at the moment and it hasn't been for a
while so I just again don't want to push
myself like I want to do what I want I
want to enjoy the colors that I have in
my collection I feel like I have done
such a great job at not buying as much
as I used to
don't get me wrong and still purchase
things but I really do feel like I'm
buying things that I want not because
they're new not because they're hyped
about not because everyone's talking
about them and have them I'm buying them
because I honestly think that they'll
work for me that I'm excited for them
I'm buying more on a personalized thing
which is what it should have been at the
beginning but it just never was we all
know how the YouTube mind frame goes
where you just kind of buy everything
when you first get into the beauty
community we were all there anyway I
started upstate you guys let you know
that this is going to be my finale I
ended up having pan on one two three
four five six seven eight shadows I know
I did have a few with tan to start with
I can't remember which ones I tried it
I did an okay job I could have done
better but I'm still really happy with
where I'm at and I hope you guys
understand I'm sorry if you really enjoy
my pan that peloton you'll be sad to not
be seeing those but at least for now
until the end of the year I'm just going
to enjoy my collection I have other
project pans going on I will leave a
link down below if you want to check
those out
I really do still want to use up my
collection and enjoy my collection and
not just buy buy buy but for me this
year pan that palette just isn't going
to work out just everything I'm going to
end the video I hope you guys are having
a great day and I will see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
