channel this is going to be my pan that
palette update for January as you guys
know I didn't go with my pan that
palette this year or the first year I'm
ever doing it I decided to pan as many
eyeshadows as possible so my goal is
just to hit pan again on as many
eyeshadows as I can so that way I can
see visible progress in my collection
this year I just didn't want to get tied
down to a single palette and then not
use anything else in my collection I
wasn't ready for the commitment so first
off I'm gonna show you guys where I got
with a couple of palettes I chose and
just some extra shadows that I happened
to work on I did hit pan on two shadows
so I'll show you this first that is
really exciting my goal is to hit pan on
25 eyeshadows this year specifically so
I need to hit pan on at least two a
month to make that happen so let me show
you those first the first shadow I hit
pan on this month was cream from the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills lavish palette
there you can see up there in the corner
I was using this all over my lid from my
like lash line to my brow bone just to
set my primer I liked it it isn't as
bright as I normally would use it's kind
of this like peachy color and so it
doesn't really give me any like
brightening effect on my lid so I
wouldn't like repurchase this shade but
for me that's good enough pan that's
quite a bit of pan and yeah I hit that
this month so I did move on to another
eyeshadow and the other shadow I hit pan
on this month was from a Maybelline quad
this is the Maybelline eye studio quad
and virtually violet and it's kind of
difficult to see there but I did hit pan
on this purple shade I was using this in
my brows when my hair was purple this
month and because that brush is quite
stiff and because this shadow is quite
soft it was pretty easy to hit pan on it
I did really like this shade in my brows
I like a glimmery kind of iridescent or
shimmery shade in the brows when I have
color I know a lot of people love matte
but if you're already going colorful
sometimes it's kind of fun to have that
Sheen and this one worked really well
for that so that is another shadow I hit
pan on
other than that I really haven't made
any considerable progress in any shades
last time I told you guys I showed you a
couple different pellets and I was gonna
like go in between on and I think now
after seeing how this month won I think
I'm just gonna pick specific shadows
that way I'm giving myself a better game
plan going into the month instead of
like any shadow from this palette I'm
gonna try to work on an ending shadow
from this palette I'm gonna have
specific shades from different palettes
and different singles so that way I can
really see if I'm making progress and
really have like a specific goal so
that's how I'm gonna set this up more so
going into the future
so on my Anasazi Beverly Hills palette
lavish palette since I hit pan on that
I'm gonna kind of call it quits and the
next shot I really want to focus on from
this palette is Sienna I did use this
quite a bit this month but there is not
really a dent it so I'm hoping if I
really use this a lot this month I can
get a dent going in it I really love
that shade it's beautiful I can use just
that on my eyes and it's so pretty so I
would like to focus in on that shade and
then this shade truffle up in the corner
is the shade I used the most after those
three shades including orange soda so
I'm going to kind of focus on that one
too anytime I need a darker crease color
I'm gonna be putting that in the crease
didn't like the outer half of the eye
there is like a shimmer in this and I do
find if I did not tap my brush off like
a million times I will get like a dark
fallout on the outer portion of my eyes
so that's something I have to keep in
mind but any time I need that dark
shadow I'm going to be using that so
hopefully I can make a little bit of a
dent on that eye shadow as well this
month I had said in my intro video that
I was going to focus on the Smashbox
blue eyes palette and I am but really
only one shade so this shade here is
called custard it's hard to tell but
there is definitely a dip going there
you can kind of see it in the shadow I
did put this in my finish five by Cinco
DeMayo that shades specifically to hit
pan on so that is why I have been you
know making more progress in it because
it is a specific goal and that's what
I'm gonna try to make this one more
specific when it comes to what shadows
I'm using but other than that I really
hate this palette I just
these are really powdery if you can tell
how dirty my palate is I mean it there's
just so much kick up there the type of
shadows that you swatch they feel soft
but when you put them on your like hand
or your eye they just dust off so fast
there's no sticking power doesn't matter
if you have a base or anything once I
hit pan on the custard shade I think I'm
just gonna call this palate done I'm not
gonna work on it anymore I please it's
horribly sad my voice um but once I hit
pan on that custard shade I'm not gonna
work on this palette anymore it's just
not worth it I have so many other
palettes and eyeshadows I'd rather work
on and that's kind of why I'm even doing
this project is to really test out
different eyeshadows in my collection
and if I love them then awesome I'm
getting use out of them and enjoying
them and sort of them wasting away but
if I don't love them it gives me more
motivation to declutter that from my
collection so I'm just going to continue
to work on that one but I am NOT going
to be touching any of these shadows in
here it's they're kind of like the Kat
Von D st. palette I just it wasn't worth
it you know the other palette I believe
I said I would work on in the last video
was my like made-up Z palette that I
made up myself but I am currently using
that in my like kit and stuff stuff kind
of straight away from that so there's no
real progress to show you there and that
is another reason why I'm just picking
specific shadows because if I can name
the shadow I feel like I'll have better
success so now I'm just going to show
you the rest of the shadows that I
specifically want to work on for
February so yeah if you guys have seen
my finish seven by spring you know I'm
working on this eye shadow up here in
the Tarte aqua Lily's palette I am using
that as like a face highlight it's what
I have on my face today I do really
enjoy this I think that I will hit pan
on it hopefully pretty soon I'm gonna
keep focusing on that I really like it
on inner tear-duct as well this bottom
shadow from the steel in mind palette is
something I'm also working on once I hit
pan in that cream shadow from the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills lavish palette
I started just working on this one this
is definitely more my type it's a
lighter shade so it really brightens up
the lid and usually I don't put
something on the lid I'll just do a warm
crease and keep my eyelid
Matt so it works really well for that
this is in the color reason and I will
be focusing on that one this month and
really the last shadow I'm gonna focus
in on this month is this Stila countless
color pigments shadow in the color indi
I did have this in my blush collection
because I thought that it was kind of
crazy to use as an eyeshadow but you
guys know I love doing my brows really
colorful so I have been using this in my
brows and I've really been liking it so
I'm just gonna continue using it that
way that's how I hit pan on my other
like shadow that's from the same line
from Stila and it worked really well so
I'm hoping I can hit pan this month
because again it's a stiff brush and
even if it's a smaller amount of pan I'm
okay with that I'm gonna work on this
one as well hopefully you guys enjoyed
this update I'm still working on the
floor mat and everything since I am
doing this different than just a normal
pan that palette I'm also considering
changing the name of this because
technically I'm not really panning a
palette like I don't know if I want to
do like project I don't even know I
don't know what to call this video so if
you guys have any ideas for maybe
calling this something else I just don't
want people to be like you're not panic
valley because I'm really not panning a
pallet this year I'm just panning
eyeshadows and it can be a little
misleading to tag it that way as a pan
that palette when it's not but I'm just
filming them in the same way yeah anyway
that is all for this video I will see
you guys in my next one
I hope you're having a wonderful day bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
