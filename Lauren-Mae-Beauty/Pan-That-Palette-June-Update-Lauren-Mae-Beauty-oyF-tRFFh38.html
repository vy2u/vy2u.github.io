since my pan that palette update but I
am doing it now I'm kind of doing this
like my project use it up so this is
going to be my I'm just gonna call it a
June update and then I'll just do an
update in July and we'll kind of like
forget about me yeah I'm so sorry but I
did hit pan on three eyeshadows since my
last update so let's get into my
progress and then I'll show you guys the
shadows that I'm gonna be focusing on in
the next month a hit pan and two of the
shades out of my lorac pro 2 palette I'm
so happy buff was one of the shadows I
was working on this is just a matte
cream color it's a very yellow tone
cream though I use this to set my
eyeshadow primer and just set all over
the lid I like it it's nice it's not my
favorite one ever just because I wish it
was a little brighter but it doesn't
work nice and I know I hit down on it
and then the other shadow from this
palette I was working on with snow I
love using this as an inner corner
highlight it's so bright so pretty and I
hit pan on that shadow as well I'm so
happy about that I think it's really
nice to see more than just one shadow
with pan in it and a palette so it's
nice that this one has two in it and
then the other shadow that I am ecstatic
about using and hitting pan on is this
one from Too Faced this is leading lady
it's depotted from one of their really
old palettes so you can't get it anymore
but I did hit pan I've been working on
this one in so many different videos and
it's so nice that's what it looks like
can you see it I don't know if you guys
can see it I'm working on my lighting
situation but I just I really like this
shadow I think it works really nice it
does get a lot of hard pan but someone
told me about the tape trick it works
great so I've just been using the tape
to kind of just kick back some of that
hard pan I also use my fingers in it to
put it on my eye just to get the best
pigmentation and I'm sure that's part of
the reason that it gets hard pan so fast
as well so yeah I hit pan I'm so happy
about that that's so exciting and this
is an older shadow and I'm really
excited to hopefully maybe even move it
out this year that's kind of you know
intense but we'll see and that's really
it for what I've hit pan on I really
didn't make progress in any of the other
shadows that I was wanting to work on
I've just been exploring I got a lot of
new eyeshadows from makeup geek this
month I'll leave those
down below my eyeshadow hall video but
I've just been exploring and just doing
fun things and having fun in my
collection I mean I guess I use desert
sands quite a bit I'll just show you
that one that's it there so you can see
a bit of a dip going in it I use this
all the time as a crease color in that
grungy look with the blue lip I use this
all over the lid I do really like that I
don't think I'll be hitting pan on it
like anytime soon maybe in two months if
I used it just as consistently but I
guess I I mean I guess it's progress
I shouldn't proud of that but I really
like that shadow and now for next month
I think I'm just going to pick a couple
shadows I've been really having fun
exploring my collection doing different
looks and feeling just creative and not
like I have to use certain eyes shadow
so I think I'm only gonna pick about
four shadows to really focus on and hone
in on and try to use maybe one of them a
day or just use them more often than any
other shadows in my collection the first
shadow we want to focus on is creme
brulee from makeup geek I have had this
maybe a week and a half and I already
can see so much progress in it so I just
love using this as a crease shade I'm
using it as a crazy shade today or like
a transition shade and I absolutely love
it it's so pretty it's so funny because
to me I got this just because it was
like a staple makeup geek color and I
mean I knew I'd like it but I really
like it I'm really glad I bought this
one another shadow I want to work on his
bananas from the peanut butter and jelly
palette from Too Faced that's it there I
have a bit of a dent going I haven't
used it at all last month and I feel
like it's been in every single one of
these pan that palette since I got it
but I do want to hit pan on it I just
think it feels so good to hit pan on
this palette cuz I do love it so much so
I'm going to be working on bananas and
try to use it at least a couple times a
week hopefully I can hold true to that
I'm bringing back an oldie this is
Sienna here and I want to hit pan on it
I have a pretty good dent going in it
and I think that if I really focus on it
this month I can use it up it is in like
my outer corner today and I've just
really been enjoying that nice kind of
warm Brown to deepen things up so I've
really been enjoying that
want to hit pan all on my mom's calling
and we want to hit pan on Sienna and
just finally have a satisfaction of
hitting pan on that shadow if you've
been here from the beginning of the year
you know that was in my first couple
ones and just never quite made it so I'm
hoping this month is the month and the
last shadow I want to focus on is one
you guys just saw in my finish six like
summer finale I want to be done with the
red but I already have such a big dip
going in it that I'm hoping I could just
use it a couple more times and just get
it done I think I want to maybe do a
tutorial on how I use a red eye shadow
and I thought that would be another way
to use it I just want to hit pan on it
and then I can kind of like put it away
and feel satisfied so I am going to be
throwing this one in this month's
challenge and see if I can hit pan on
that so those are the four eyeshadows I
really want to focus on this month are
through July so the end of this month
and into July I hope you guys enjoyed
I'm really happy I'm gonna leave the
total eye shadow count that I've hit pan
on for the year at the bottom in my
description bar if you're wondering I'm
also going to link the eyeshadows I hit
pan on video if you haven't seen that
you can see all of my eye shadows that
I've hit pan on in my whole collection
most of them are from this year but for
my whole collection if you're interested
and you want to see some pan and you
want to feel inspired tip panel Tamir
shadows that's definitely a great video
to watch I love watching videos that
show pan and used up products just to
feel inspired and excited about using
your own collection up so that's
everything I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
