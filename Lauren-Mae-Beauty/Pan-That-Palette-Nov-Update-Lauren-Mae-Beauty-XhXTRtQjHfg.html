Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be a pan that palette update
I have not done a pan that palette
update in a long time I think the last
one I did was in June I want to say and
it's I missed May so that one was like a
double month update and then it's been
since June and it's November so I will
leave listed a playlist or all my other
previous videos if you want to go watch
those I don't know why I stopped posting
them it wasn't like a conscious decision
I just I kind of forgot and then I
honestly feel like I just kind of I just
kind of spaced it and then then people
have been commenting like where's this
series are you gonna post one of these
soon I'm like oh my gosh I haven't been
really even concerned about it or even
like been paying attention and I feel
like I haven't even been really noticing
other people's updates like I don't know
why I just been I think I have pan on
six new shades since I've taken my like
break I guess so I'm gonna show you guys
those and then I'm not gonna show you
guys all the old ones you can just look
back and I'll do a recap at the end of
the year but let's just get into the
shadows I've hit pan on and then we'll
go from there I have three single
shadows here that I've hit pan on the
first one is probably my favorite shadow
out of everything that I have here this
is from Coastal Scents and it's the
shade pumpkin pie I really like this
this wasn't a favorites video and I've
had quite a bit of pan I did this not
because I was trying to hit pan on it I
just liked it that much and was using it
every single day I was using it as a
crease color and all over the lid it was
like a one shadow look for me I really
enjoyed it and I highly suggest this
shadow this is like $1.99 or if you get
them on sale a dollar you cannot beat
that it's matte it's just perfect I love
this and yeah I hit pan on it cuz I was
using it that much another Coastal
Scents shadow that I hit pan on there
you go you can see that glittering this
is the shade antique lilac I was using
this as a brow color so that's why I hit
pan on it I do like this in its nice
again it's mad if you guys want me to
put together a video of my top like
Coastal Scents eyeshadows let me know I
do have quite a few and I think they're
just really good for the price I know
more if it gets a lot of love but I feel
like Coastal Scents show
are really similar and an even better
price so and then the last single shadow
I have here this is grand stand by
makeup geek and I know it's kind of hard
to see but in the very middle
I do have pan it's just not like super
glittering because the shadows kind of
on it but I did hit pan on this I was
using this in my kit I also used it a
bit for school so that's how I hit pan
on this I really like to makeup geek
foiled eyeshadows I'll give you a swatch
of this actually that's it they're
really nice formula I don't like that
they're super soft in the pan because I
do find that they crack easily and when
I have them in my Z palette I just feel
like they're kind of vulnerable and
fragile in there but I really do like
this color it's a perfect lid color
that's not too light and not too dark I
really like it and it's a good one and
the last two shadows that I have stuff I
only met pan on five actually not six
are in palette and the first one here is
one I was trying to hit ban on so bad
and that is the color Sienna let's turn
it the right way this color here and
finally hit pan I really do like this
color it's perfect for an outer crease
color for me it's nice and warm I really
like it complements a lot of the
different looks that I do and I'm really
happy to finally hit pan on it I do have
a backup of this in a different palette
I just happened to come in another
palette I have so I'm glad to be getting
use out of this one and I really highly
suggest that color from anastacio and
another anastacio this is the color
golden ochre in the modern renaissance
palette and I did hit pan on that I
wasn't expecting to hit pan I don't know
how I hit pan on it that fast this color
is very soft so I feel like it's kind of
a misleading indication of how much I've
used the palette or that color I've used
the PAL at a time but golden ochre is
not like my favorite color or anything
it just is really softly pressed and the
brush I use in it just kind of eat away
at the powder really fast so I do hit me
on that though another shadow 5 more
shadows down there how to show you but I
did also hit pan on my kat von d palette
that was in my finish 13 by Halloween I
will leave a picture of it here
so that is another one that I can add to
the list I don't have that pallet any
longer I did declutter and give it to my
mom yeah six shadow six more shadows I
think that's pretty good in total I've
hit pan on twenty-two shadows fourth
year and my goal is to hit pan on 25 so
I only need to hit pan on three more
shadows I definitely think I can do that
I'm not gonna pick any like contenders
for the next couple of months and not
even sure if I'm gonna do an update
between November and December I will if
I hit pan on a couple of shades but if I
don't I'm just gonna do an update at the
end of the year so that way it's just
not like a boring video I really like
hitting pan on shadows I think it's
really fun and I still want to continue
to get use out of my collection but I
don't know how I want to go into next
year with this so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed the update got to see some new
pan which is awesome let me know if you
guys have any thoughts or like ideas for
me for how to work this I might do like
a one month one palette just to keep
exploring my collection but not
necessarily focusing on pan as much I'm
not sure I don't know how I want to work
it but I will definitely update you guys
at the end of the year and show you guys
all my eye shadows together that I've
hit pan on for 2016 I hope you guys
enjoyed the update and I will see you
guys in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
