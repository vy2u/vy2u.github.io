Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is going to be my first pan that palette
update I series know I'm trying to hit
pan and every shadow in my Z palette
this year for me I don't care about
using up the whole shadow I just want to
see pan and see that I've used it and so
this year I thought it would just be fun
to pick my single shadows on my Z
palette and with that I'm going to be
pairing a premade palette with this
palette every single month to try to get
use out of other things so for the month
of January I use my morphe and
kathleenlights palette I'm just gonna
show you progress on this straight away
I do have pictures it'll be like a month
by month I'm trying really hard to have
pictures to show you guys I think it's
really cool and I see the palettes more
for month after month and you can really
see the progress with pictures
this is my palette there's one really
big change in it and it's that I've hit
pan on this shade here this is just a
matte cream shade from Coastal Scents
it's in the shade shan wan nude if
you're wondering about the rest of the
shades in this palette they are all
listed down below by row these two these
two shadows I already had pan on I also
have pan on this shadow although you
can't see it so in total I have hit pan
on four shadows in this palette I have
29 shadows to go which is a lot of
Shadows to work on I didn't really give
you guys an idea of what I would be
working on last time so I think I am
gonna do that now because there are a
few shadows that I'm basically trying to
use every single day to hit pan and them
faster or just have a bit more structure
to trying to finish this this shade
right here is by Mac it's called vanilla
and I am using that as like my brow bone
crease shade this is packed really hard
in the pan so it takes a long time to
use it up way longer than it would take
to use this up I set my entire eyelid
area with that from the brow bone to the
lash line so I think that I'll
definitely hit pan on that hopefully
next month that'd be amazing but we'll
see I'm also working on orange soda I
have a bit of a dip going so I
definitely think I could hit pan on that
next month I also really want to work on
this shade here this is from Coastal
Scents I believe it's called Oktoberfest
and it is cracked so I'm gonna kind of
use that to my advantage and just start
working on that it's such a pretty color
for the outer corner on me it's a nice
warm Brown it really brings out the blue
in my eyes I really like it and then the
other shade I kinda want to focus on is
desert sands which already has a dip as
well I feel like if I focus on those for
I think I could potentially hit pan and
most of them if not all of them by next
month and that would feel really great
going into April having hit pan on so
many shades since I only hit pan on one
shade this month so those are my goals
on this palette for next month now let's
talk about the companion palettes I was
using the morphe and kathleenlights
palette last time like you guys know I
should have my four looks one palette up
by now I will leave that link down below
if you want to check out the looks I've
done this look was done using this
palette today as well I thought it would
give you kind of an overall review after
using it because I doubt I'm gonna hit
on any of the shapes in these like
one-month pallets but I thought it'd be
nice just to give you an overview and
maybe I'll do my four looks one palette
combined with a companion palette I
don't know maybe I just thought that
right now we'll see I really do like
this palette I think the quality is good
for the price basically what sells me on
this palette is the color selections
really nice but the price on it I didn't
use this as much as I thought I would I
do like some of the shades in here I
think they're all pigmented you know
they're they're nice don't get me wrong
I just find that I reach for other
things over this but I'm not upset about
it because this palette only cost me
$14.99 if this palette was like $30 or
more I feel like it would be a
disappointment for how much I've used it
in this last month when I was really
trying to grant it I was using other
palettes because I'm in a lot of
projects right now so yeah overall I
like it it's not like a love it's
definitely not a must-have I don't think
everyone needs it but I do think that
it's a great palette for the price and I
think it's a nice selection there's
nothing wrong with it though the palette
I'm using choose during the month of
March is my pastel goth palette I got
this palette at the beginning of the
year and I really want to just use this
and have fun I also really want to be
able to focus on my Z palette and since
this has a bunch of fun colorful colors
I don't feel like it's going to compete
as much as the Z palette like the
kathleenlights one did I think this will
be really fun I'm really excited the
Clementine shades my favorite because I
feel like it's a neutral I can use that
everyday I think it's so pretty so I'm
excited to have a reason and like force
myself to use this more and I really do
think these will be fun to pair together
and work out some looks with I'm really
excited I'm still really pumped about
this palette I'm so excited to see some
more pan on this it already feels so
good to see so many shades on the top
row with pan so I'm just excited to
continue using this and loving it I'm
really into the single shadows I'm
feeling like they're just the best bang
for your buck you can get exactly what
you want and you don't have to settle
with shades you don't want that's
everything guys I will see you in my
next video thanks so much for watching
