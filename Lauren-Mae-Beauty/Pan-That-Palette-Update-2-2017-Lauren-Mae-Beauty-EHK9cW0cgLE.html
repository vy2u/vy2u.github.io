Lauren thanks so much for watching this
is my last video I'm filming I don't
know the order I'm gonna be uploading
them but it's my last one I filmed a lot
today this is going to be my pan that
palette update this is my second updater
I believe I'm really excited to show you
guys the progress because I have a lot I
actually already filmed this once but I
totally forgot to talk about my pastel
goth palette and also pick a new like a
companion palette this month so I was
like yeah let's just refill them I will
show you guys what my palette looked
like from month month
you
and this is where my palette looks like
today I'm super excited I've hit pan on
one two three more shades since the last
time I talked with you guys I'm just
really happy with that progress it took
a long time to get this one going and I
feel just happy to see more pants you
guys know I'm doing the Z palette and I
am NOT doing like a traditional pre-made
palette so I feel like this is kind of a
lot these are full-size shadows I'm
realizing more and more I don't know if
it's gonna be possible to hit pan and
all of them but we'll see it's still
staying strong so I now have pan in
seven shadows and I'm gonna go through
just the ones that I hit pan on this
month if you want to see the other
updates I'll leave a link down below the
first one here is orange soda from
anastacio I love that shadow you guys
know that it's like one of my Holy
Grails and it's beautiful I love it in
the crease and I didn't have any trouble
hitting pan on it it's a pretty powdery
shadow so I feel like it was kind of
easy but I absolutely love that shadow
and I I'm just really happy to see that
it looks like I love that shadow next I
hit pan and Octoberfest
super excited about that one this shadow
is cracked so I feel like there wasn't a
ton to get through I just used that to
my advantage but regardless I love that
shadow I think it's really pretty it
looks so good in my outer corner and I
did use it quite a bit this month I
really enjoy it and suggest it it's in a
lot of my less stupid videos in the last
one which was really exciting is the Mac
vanilla shadow I did hit pan on that
I've been using this to set my entire
eyelid from the lash line to the brow
bone I feel like you gets hard pan
really fast and Mac shadows are also
pressed really hard so I'm surprised
that I actually was able to hit pan on
that because it just takes forever it
doesn't matter I can dig my brush in
there and I barely get any product so I
was surprised when I hit pan on that one
so some goals I have with this palette I
really liked hit pan in Peach Smoothie
up here I use it and try to use it every
single day just so I can hit pan on it I
would also like to hit pan and desert
sands I have a pretty big dip going in
that shadow so I think that's possible
as well for a stretch goal I'd love to
just keep working on
shimma shimma and maybe hit pan on that
use it as an inner corner highlight I
might even start using it as a face
highlight just to see some progress on
it honestly those are the three shades I
really feel like that's actually just
possible at this point but I would like
to just overall maybe start making some
dips and other shadows maybe chickadee
maybe petal peach maybe antiqued just
start getting dips so that hopefully by
the next month I can hit pan on it I'm
really overall happy with how I'm doing
on my palette and hopefully I can just
continue to make more progress now for
my companion palette I picked the pastel
goth um this month and I was really
enjoying it I used these shoots I use
these two shades quite a bit I really
like the white color other than that
these shades don't get as much love for
me because they're so cool toned and I
definitely prefer warm tones on myself I
will be having a 4 looks 1 palette
coming up soon I just need to film a
couple more looks for it
overall though I do like the quality of
this palette more the more I use it I
think it just doesn't swatch very well
but actually using it on the eye I think
it's nice and I've really actually been
enjoying that white color I used it as a
face highlight I used it to like wipe
away fallout from underneath my eyes and
just to like overall brighten my face I
love using it on the lid when I have
like oranges and Pink's on I think it
just gives a nice brightness but it
still matte it doesn't add that shimmer
so I actually enjoyed this more than I
thought I would even though I mean I do
like this palette but I it and enjoyed
it more than I thought I would and for
the new companion palette I want to do
the lorac unzipped palette this is an
oldie but a goodie I prefer this to the
Naked 3 and I don't know what it is but
I just wanted to do this palette I just
want to actually use it I remember using
it when I worked at justice in Arizona
and loving it so I kind of just want to
bust it back out and since this is kind
of neutral toned although it's rosy it's
like neutral cool tone I'm hoping that
with the warm shadows that are in my Z
palette I can kind of do a different
range of
and again I just want to bring an oldie
out of the woodwork and see if I still
love this as much as I remember loving
it it almost looks like there's barely
any use on this except for maybe these
two shades and that's crazy because I
remember like using it all the time so I
wonder how much actually did use it I
just wonder if my memory is failing me
or if I actually do love this product so
we will find that out this month and
that's everything for my pan that
palette update I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day and I will see
you in my next video thanks so much for
watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
