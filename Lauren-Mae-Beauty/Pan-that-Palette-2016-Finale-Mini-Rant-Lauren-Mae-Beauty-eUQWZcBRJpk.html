Lauren this is going to be my pan that
palette 2016 finale video I'm gonna say
a front that I'm not gonna be showing a
bunch of the pan that I made throughout
the year it's just too long of the video
and I really want to get into 2017 I'm
already so behind on everything so I
will link down below all the videos that
are my progress if you want to see that
I will also link my eyeshadows I've hit
pan on video if you really want to see
some eyeshadow pan it's just gonna be
the way it is so let's just get into my
progress from where we left off last
time though I only needed to hit pan on
one more eyeshadow to hit my goal of 25
eyeshadows for the year if you haven't
been with me from the beginning my goal
is hit pan on as many eyeshadows as
possible
I'd look through my collection and saw
that basically all my eyeshadow palettes
and all my single shadows looks like I
could take a million Instagram photos
with them because they were that new and
I love eyeshadow and I just wanted to
show love to my shadows this year
instead of just buying new stuff so I
still bought new stuff but I definitely
made a dent it just visibly seeing how
much I love my collection if that makes
sense last time I wanted to hit pan on
the shade here this is vanilla nuts from
the Laura Mercier artist palette and
obviously I hit quite a bit of pan on
that so I have two pans showing in this
palette really happy about that and I
was just so excited to meet the goal of
25 shadows for the year but I went above
and beyond that I also hit pan and a
couple more shadows in modern
renaissance so this is an amazing
palette I've used this so much this year
and this is really what I used quite a
bit when we were out of town I already
had pan on golden ochre but I did hit
pan in tempera which is just a very
similar shade to the one in the Laura
Mercier I love matte cream shades for
setting my primer so that I can easily
blend on top of it so that's why I just
I can go through those like that but I
also hit pan on burnt orange down here
which is an amazing crease shade I like
to use it as a soft transition depending
on how much I load up my brush and how
heavy I go with it so
I'm really happy to see so much progress
in the modern renaissance you know I'm
just gonna say something right now I
think it's it's just a thing I've
noticed but it's just interesting to me
that so many people can talk about
things that they love and then they just
don't even have pan on it I really think
that first impressions I think are great
or you know a favorites video or
something but some of these people on
YouTube I just don't know how they
possibly can use something enough to
know that they love it
or that it's a Holy Grail or all these
things when I can see no progress that
they've made in that product like I know
as a project banner that if you use a
bronzer every day in three months you
should have pan so if you don't I don't
know do you know what I'm saying
I I'm just ranting here at the end it's
not a rant but you know I just think you
can learn so much about yourself so much
about the products you actually like and
how good our product actually is by by
using it daily every day and I really
just wonder how much these products that
are people's favorites and raved about
how much they're actually being used by
people because I don't see any progress
and if you know the modern Renaissance
is your favorite palette you should have
like probably some pan on it if not at
least dense like again I know some
people like to switch it up a ton I'm
just saying you know you can't just have
a bunch of finger swatches and a palette
and it'd be your favorite let me go just
sipping my tea being a little Kermit
over here okay just saying I don't know
that's just something I've noticed and
wanted to talk about after you know
seeing how easy it was for me to have
panel knows I was by no means trying to
hit pan or any of those shadows I was
just naturally using it for about a
month straight you know what I mean so
if if you used it for about a month
throughout the year you should probably
see some progress right no shade to
anyone I just especially with like these
Instagram posts it's like I see them
post like my favorite shadows and it'll
be like a makeup geek palette that looks
brand-new
and I saw Jacqueline post something it
was a while ago it's like lorac and it
was her palette it's like all used up
and
like totally not gross but you know used
and she's like tags lorac and was like
why don't you show palette that actually
has been used I thought that was
hilarious cuz it's just true right like
it's not meant to just look pretty it's
meant to make you look pretty right or
better are you already pretty but you
know what I'm saying anyway this is
rambley at the end that's my update for
the finale I hope you guys enjoyed it
I'm glad I'm only filming a couple
videos today because I'd be like crazy
and all of them yeah so um that's it for
this video let's cut it off here before
I get too crazy and stay tuned for my
pan that palette 2017 intro I'm so
excited
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
