Lauren this is going to be my pan that
palette 2017 intro video I'm really
excited because I I kind of have a new
vision for this year although it's
similar it's a little different I want
to hit pan on as many eyeshadows as
possible this year that's my ultimate
goal but I am kind of focusing on a
couple palettes so I'd mentioned in a
video earlier that I had my Z palette
and I always find it so awesome when I
hit pan on one of my individual shadows
I kind of brought up in that video that
I might pick this for my pan that
palette and you guys were like that
sounds awesome I want to if I can hit
pan on every shadow in here this year I
think that would be amazing I don't know
if that's possible it's quite a few
shadows let's count them it's 33 shadows
and last year I only hit pan and 25 it's
kind of a big stretch I do have pan on a
couple shadows already so that kind of
helps but I just think it would be
awesome to see a lot of progress and a
lot of love out of my single shadows on
my Z palette the shadows I already have
pan on are creme brulee from makeup geek
this is a pumpkin pie from Coastal
Scents and then this one here which I
think it's mesmerised let's see if I'm
right
Oh No grandstand for makeup geek I know
you cannot see but it's just so metallic
already in the pan but I do have pan on
that shadow as well so I want to just
try to make as much progress on this I'm
really excited I have a good dip going
in desert sands already I also have some
dips going in Peach Smoothie and orange
soda from makeup geek and honest hacia
but on top of that just so I don't get
bored or anything like that I am gonna
do kind of a one month one palette
coupled with it if you will so this
first month of January I'm going to be
doing the kathleenlights and morphe
palette and I'm really excited I just
got this in the mail if you want to see
swatches of this I'll leave that video
link down below but I just want to kind
of use this palette get an idea of how I
actually like the morphe shadows on for
a swatch they swatch really nicely and
overall I think this is a good palette
on first impressions and the few times
I've used it but I really feel like with
consistent use is when you really know
if you actually like something and it's
not just like yeah it's good but I don't
like it like I want to know do I like
this will I reach for this so by putting
it in my rotation I think that I will
really get a good idea
I use this palette today on my eyes
along with the peanut butter and jelly
palette I was originally gonna do the
peanut butter and jelly palette as my
first one month 1 palette but I decided
that since I just got this before I put
this away and just don't use it I want
to get some good use out of it and get
my ideas on it yeah so that's my
starting point I'm super excited for
this I just want to hit pan guys um I
don't think for my 1 month 1 palette
palettes oh my gosh I don't think for
the palettes that are the 1 month
ones I don't know if I'm gonna hit pan
on any of those because you know it's
kind of hard to hit pan on something in
just one month but um we'll see if I can
make some extra pan in these palettes on
top of the Z palette I'm telling you I'm
done filming for today hopefully I'll
come back ready to go I'm sure you saw
my finale video and we're like what the
heck so let's end that here
cheers to 2017 pan that palette we've
got this I'm so excited to see even more
pan in my collection I will see you in
my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
