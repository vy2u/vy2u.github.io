channel it's Lauren this is going to be
my pan that palette update for the month
of March I'm going to start off with the
eyeshadows that I hit pan on and you
guys know I'm trying to hit pan on as
many eyeshadows as possible this whole
year so I feel really good I hit pan on
three eyeshadows so let's get into the
ones I hit pan on the first shadow I hit
pan on was this one from Stila this is
the countless color pigment in the color
indie and I'm going to zoom in so you
guys can see it as you can see there
there's a little bit of pan shining
through super happy about that that is
good enough for me really happy I hit
pan on this shadow so I can just put it
away this is something I'm gonna hold on
to you for a little bit but depending I
don't know I might just put it in my kit
or might get rid of it I'm not really
sure I do really like this color I just
I know I want to hit pan on everything
so we'll see I don't know how I feel
this is my s mhm shadow in the color
cracker it's just a matte cream shade I
hit pan on this seriously a couple days
after I film that video so I definitely
got a lot of pan out of this and then I
moved on to something else really happy
with the progress this one was like an
easy one these ones are easy and there
was kind of a surprise I shadow I hit
pan on this month this is my lorac Pro
palette and if you can see there there's
a little bit of pan shining through on
the color cream I just hit that today
and I don't know why but I've just been
going back to my lorac palette my pro
one and pro two and I just really been
loving them so yeah I hit pan on that
really happy that makes three eyeshadows
of pan on them in my lorac pro 1 palette
so those are the ones that hit pan on
I'll show you the progress on other
shadows and I'm just going to I think
basically all the progress I made I'm
also going to be continuing working on
those so I'm gonna kind of do that all
in one step here so this was my other
sm8 shadow this is in the color squeak I
don't know if you can tell but this
bottom part of the pan is definitely
worn down this is a tough one it's
packed really really tightly I am using
a bigger brush in this because I am
using it as a face highlight and I use
it as like an inner corner highlight as
well so I'm just going to be continuing
working on that I think if I continue to
use
the rate I have been I will be able to
hit pan on it in April so fingers
crossed for that one I'd really like to
hit pan on this and kind of just move on
I'm just kind of over this specific
shimmery shade for highlighting I just
want to use something else so hopefully
if I work really hard and use it a ton
like for the first half of the month I
can just get it done and move on to
something else another eyeshadow I have
been working on for quite awhile is a
color caramel or caramel in the
Anastacio Miah Miah palette there it is
it has quite a big dip in it I am trying
to use it as often as I can but again I
don't want to completely limit myself on
looks this year that's part of the
reason I just want to hit pan so I'm
okay that I have a hit pan but I really
really really want to hit pan this month
so I am going to kind of forbid myself
from using the peanut butter and jelly
palette the peanut butter shade because
this shade is quite similar to it so I'd
rather just get this one done so I can't
use the peanut butter shade at all this
month and if I do that I feel like I
will be able to hit pan on that that's
kind of it for the ones I was focusing
on except for Sienna I had did not even
touch Sienna this month so from the
anasazi of Beverly Hills lavish palette
so I am NOT going to even show you it it
has no new progress and I'm kind of not
I'm not over that shadows and I don't
like it I just haven't been reaching for
it and I'm not going to force myself to
use it so I'm not even going to try to
focus on it this next month this is my
peanut butter jelly palette from Too
Faced and I want to kind of focus on the
banana shade I already have quite a bit
of a dip going especially for only
having at about a month I definitely
want to see that dip grow maybe I can
hit pan so I've just really been
enjoying the shade on the lid and I just
want to use it quite a few times this
month as well and just see how much
farther I can make that dip go another
eyeshadow like specific color I want to
focus on this month it's also from Too
Faced this is a single shadow that i
depotted and it is in the color leading
lady I believe I departed this from a
very old old palette I'll give you a
swatch of it it's a really pretty kind
of I don't know champagne pink color I
really like this color I've already used
quite a bit def on how zipped-up going
so I think I can
Pan if I use this again quite a bit this
month and then other than that I kind of
just want to focus on my lorac palette I
have just really been liking them this
month so one of the reasons I do
throwing that other Too Faced shadow in
is because I've already hit pan on nude
and I really don't want to like
completely use this shade up because if
I want to travel somewhere I want to be
able to have like the whole palette so I
thought for the look I've been doing
which is like mauve in the crease and
then nude on the lid I can use that
other shade on the lid instead of the
nude color anyway I want to focus on mob
specifically and maybe light bronze out
of this palette but I kind of just am
okay with using just in general this
palette whatever I want to and then from
the lorac mint
I was gonna say mega Pro but the lorac
pro 2 I have been focusing on nectar so
I have a little bit of a dip going there
and then rosy and mocha are really nice
colors I've also been loving that as a
combo buff is a really nice cream
machine so I'll probably be making a dip
in that and then snow I've really been
liking as an inner corner highlight it's
a very stark color but I kind of like
that if I'm doing an intense look so
those are all the shadows that I've made
progress on and then the shadows I want
to focus on coming into April I hope you
guys are doing well in your palettes and
I've seen the ton of updates
seriously Ellis I don't know how girl
you are using up those shadows you are
so great I commend you you are doing
amazing so exam prep so is everyone but
I just like I feel like we're all like
on our game this year so proud of all of
us and I hope you guys are doing well I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
