Lauren this is going to be a super quick
update on my pan that palette I went
forever for without posting and then I
posted last month and I said that if I
made any decent progress that I would
let you guys know and I have hit pan on
to more eyeshadows and I only needed
three more for the rest of the year so
I'm down to only needing one more shadow
with pan to hit my goal of 25 shots for
the year let's just get straight into it
and I'll show you guys what I've hit pan
on first I hit pan on the color fresco
in the laura mercier palette this is the
artist palette I have this in my October
favorites I believe which I'll leave
listed down below if you want to see
that but I've just been using that quite
a bit I'm really happy to have pan on it
it kind of gives me an idea that yeah i
have used this palette and i have
enjoyed it so that makes me really
excited i think i'm gonna focus on
trying to hit pan on this cream shade as
my last shadow of the year we'll see but
i would really like to have more pan in
this palette so hopefully i can do that
and hit my goal and the other shadow
comes from my Z palette and it is makeup
geeks creme brulee it's this one here
right next to pumpkin pie
I hit pan on that one and I really enjoy
that shadow I have it on today it's just
a really nice everyday kind of crease
color are all over the lid color it's
matte it's super easy I really highly
suggest that shadow from makeup geek so
that's like mostly my update this is
something I was thinking that I thought
I'd bring it up here I might try to just
hit pan on as many eyeshadows in this
palette as possible next year I don't
know that was just something I was
thinking I just I really like saying pan
in this palette it makes me feel like
all these individual shadows that I've
paid money for actually we're worth it
I technically have three pans with
shadow and already these two and this
one here even though it's hard to see
but that was just something I was
thinking about or am I do the one
palette one month one pallet thing so
that's my update I hope you guys enjoyed
and then I will update you at the end of
the year with my intro for pan that
palette next year as well as what I've
hit pan on in this last month so fingers
crossed I can at least do one if not
I'll hit over my goal which would be
amazing hope you guys sucked everything
I hope you're having a wonderful day and
I will see you in my next video hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
