Lauren this is the panning Pro tag this
tag was created by Jacqueline or Fort
Worth famous here on YouTube she tagged
me thank you so much Declan and I
thought this was an awesome tag
especially for the project and community
so I thought that I would of course do
it so these are my answers to that tag
I'll have them listed in my description
box if you guys want to do it definitely
do it if you're in the community in any
sense of the word or in any way at all
please do this tag let's get into the
video the first question is how did you
learn about the project panning
community and what was your first
impression I cannot remember like a
single pivotal moment where I just like
saw a project panning video but I do
remember that a lot of people were doing
it as more of like a tag it wasn't like
a whole community when I first started
seeing stuff and it was more just like
hitting pan on ten items and of course
it was put with a no-buy so that was
part of the reason that people were
doing it was so that they would not buy
makeup and had to hit pan on ten items
before they could buy stuff after that I
and I just kind of watched a couple of
those videos and enjoyed them and then I
think I just must have hit a point where
not only was I ready to be receptive to
the project panik community but I must
have went down one of those like YouTube
rabbit holes where you like go to
related videos and you just get to a
place where you don't even know where
you are anymore how you got there but
with the project kind of community and
Jacqueline had mentioned this in her
video and I just think it's true that
not everyone's ready for project panning
you might not be ready for it and you
might think it's weird or you kind of
want to but you don't really you still
want to buy stuff and that's totally
fine I think that every one it's like a
spectrum where you are in your journey
with project panning I have grown so
much in the year that my channel has
been started so I can just see that like
I can watch other people's to clutters
and I can just tell that I'm in for what
I want for myself a better place and
yeah anyway my first impression was I
really liked it there was just something
about it that was I don't know an
entertaining to watch I think sometimes
makeup seems like we buy it
but there's no way you could finish it
like maybe a foundation or a powder or
something that you use every day but an
eye shadow how can you possibly finish
up an eye shadow and I remember seeing
amber F's videos like way after she had
already like done them but seeing her
finish like I had heard rumors from
other people talking about amber f and
so I finally found her videos found the
video where she showed her empty Naked
palette and I was just like blown away I
just think that's like that's crazy you
know like hitting pan is what I'm trying
to do this year but to fully finish up
an entire eyeshadow palette oh it's a
good like it's just it felt so cool to
watch and then I just started just
enjoying that content more than seeing
people haul stuff and so that was kind
of a switch for me anyway I don't know I
probably answered a bunch of other
questions in this one question number
two what's the hardest thing you've ever
panned and what's the easiest um the
hardest thing just in general for me are
lip products I'm not good at lip
products I and kind of aloe I mean it
doesn't look like it considering the
looks I wear but I'm a kind of low
maintenance when it comes to wearing my
makeup out in everyday world
I really don't touch out much I don't
touch up lip products I'm really like
seriously I like fresh sugar lip balm
girl and like I could be good with just
that so those are really hard for me to
just force myself to use just in the
first place and then on top of that to
reapply so difficult I think especially
lip glosses they're just not my favorite
so lip products for sure and the easiest
for me to pan I don't know I feel like
as I pan more and more it's not as
difficult for me just like face products
face powders are really easy because I
set my face every single day and
concealers are easy
I even have found Oh I even have found
that um eye shadows hitting pan on them
isn't as hard as I thought it would I
think that trying to use up the whole
thing would be really hard but because
it's kind of a short sprint to just like
sprint your way to hitting pan and then
you can kind of like ease up and move on
I've been I feel like it's been easier
than I thought it would be to hit pan on
shadows this year so yeah that's my
answer to that what have you attempted
that
that palate challenge why or why not
this year is the first year that I'm
kind of attempting a pan that palette I
am trying to hit pan on as many
eyeshadows in my collection as possible
I have counted up on my eyeshadows and
that's really giving me a big boost this
year to kind of like just realize oh my
gosh are there really that many
different eyeshadow shades out there and
just to be more selective in the
eyeshadows that I bring in because those
are one of my favorite makeup items to
buy I just love palettes I love them so
kind of and kind of not I just I thought
that for me especially my first year it
would just be easier and more productive
like I feel like I would have I would be
more productive trying to see a bunch of
use out of a bunch of shadows instead of
just seeing one palette completely gone
out of my collection so kind of number
four has panning affected your makeup
buying habits if so how definitely I
think that's part of like the reason I
even love project panning as much as I
do is because I wanted to try to curb by
buying I definitely feel now that I'm
not as addicted to makeup that I was
addicted for sure yeah it was like
sometimes a secret thing it was
something that I definitely enjoyed by
 LC about and I spent a lot of
money on makeup like I think back and I
just spent a lot of money on makeup and
I just think like all the other things I
could have spent my money on so
definitely this year I haven't ever put
myself in like a no buy because I want
to be able to buy the things I want but
I just really have done an amazing job
this year I'm gonna do an update on that
soon on like where I'm at with what I've
bought this year so you guys can know
like each month and then in total how
much I spent this year but I'm just
really happy and I feel like I'm
definitely more mindful of the things
I'm buying and how long they're going to
take to use up as well as kind of making
sure that if I'm bringing something new
to my collection that it's just
something like unique or just like I
really wanted the peanut butter and
jelly palette like I wanted it so bad
and I got it and I'm so happy with it
and not that those are necessarily super
unique but that was something I really
really wanted and instead of getting
and putting it in my drawer I actually
used it oh my gosh that was something I
was doing so often was like getting this
makeup and then putting it in my drawer
and not using it there's so much makeup
that I've like really never touched
before and that's something I want to
stop but yes in short I have definitely
changed my makeup buying habits because
of project panning number five what do
you plan on panning next well I just
filmed and you guys have seen the finish
six my summer project panning challenge
at the seasonal one that I'm doing I'm
constantly panning stuff though to me
project panning is just like going to be
a continuous thing in my life until I
feel like my collection is at a place
where I want it to be but I think that
it's always going to be just a fun thing
to kind of remind myself to use the
things I have and to really kind of
clear stuff out that's the next thing
I'm doing but I'm I'm always doing I'm
always in a project pan or starting a
new one or finishing one like it's it's
a never-ending thing at least for me at
this point of my life number six where
do you get your panning inspiration and
motivation from definitely the panning
community I love watching declutter
videos panning videos just anything like
that like items I've hit pan on project
pan updates pan that palette updates
just all those types of videos just keep
it fresh I've just tried to not watch
hauls I just started watching Kimberly
Clark and her anti haul videos I like
kind of want to make one myself they're
just like inspiring to like have someone
finally say you don't need this same
with Jacqueline Jacqueline just did like
why I'm not buying the sweet peach
palette and it's like we need more of
that or at least like a balance I mean I
got it I love buying stuff and I don't
want it to just be like completely
hating on consumerism but at the same
time it's just trying to be just a
better consumer for myself you know
anyway I'm getting off topic but I
definitely get a ton of inspiration from
you guys and making videos also and
seeing the comments in just having kind
of accountability because of my videos
and having an audience is definitely
keeps me motivated the times where I'm
like I don't want to use this I'm like
well crap
want to have no progress on my next
update so I better use it so that also
just for me helps my husband's also
pretty supportive like he thinks it's
weird but he's cool with it you know if
I tell them to like spray the freaking
spray every time he's in the bathroom
he'll he'll help me out and do that
sometimes so I think just that and then
my mom watches my videos too so just
like a little bit of support from family
although I don't just completely
advertise my channel to a ton of people
when I started I didn't tell friends and
family really about it just because it's
like kind of weird and again if you're
not ready to project pan and if you're
not there you just don't get it and it's
weird
I ain't gonna lie this is kind of a
weird channel but that's we all love it
and and once you get it you totally get
it so anyway that's an answer to that
one I feel like all my answers are so
rambley but I'm sorry guys
number seven let's move on what's your
favorite thing about the panning
community my favorite thing about the
panning community is the fact that
everyone is just so so kind I think the
number one thing that's like the
scariest about YouTube is just getting
hate and just yeah mostly just getting
hate like that it's not fun and that's
something that's really scary you make a
video you're already scared to upload it
and you're putting yourself out there
you put time and energy into this video
and you just have trolls or people hate
on you because they're anonymous online
a something that's scary and I've never
felt anything but love in this community
and I think the beauty community at
large can be kind of a scary place even
though there are 10 a nice people it's a
huge community a lot of people trying to
get in there trying to like make
subscribers and make videos and get you
know popular or whatever and I just feel
like the project panic community is just
so down to earth and so sweet and it's
kind of this like safe little pocket
that's like an offshoot of the beauty
community where we can just be ourselves
and support each other and I've I just
have loved that like it's amazing even
my mom is just like oh my gosh
everyone's so nice to you online and I'm
like I know it's crazy so definitely
that is something that's so amazing
about this community and that we
courage each other to start channels and
we encourage each other to post on
Instagram and I try my best to like shop
people out and you know people that I
watch and enjoy to also spread the love
that way and I just love that aspect
about our community number eight if you
are currently a project panning what is
the item that's giving you the most
trouble and that is easy I can tell you
right now because I haven't used in a
long time and that is my Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation it's the
exact opposite of a powder foundation
which is what I've been into and so it's
just been I just don't want to use it so
I'm almost out of my powder foundation
so I'm hoping I can kind of easily
transition back to that but it has been
a difficult I just don't want to use it
so that one has been really hard I have
until the fifth of May to finish it so
hopefully I can get on that soon number
nine how long do you plan to project pan
and do you see yourself stopping at any
point I kind of already answered this
but currently I just want to keep
panning stuff until I feel like my
collection is reasonable but I honestly
get a lot of stuff either because I'm
working in a beauty store and I get a
lot of samples or Gratus that way or
when I was at school or going to makeup
shows or just different things I feel
like even though I've stopped my buying
so much this last like in the last year
or so
I still have been able to collect a lot
of items so until that kind of stops and
until I feel comfortable I will continue
to project pan and honestly I just
I enjoy project panic even if later
they're more spaced out or whatever I
just I enjoy project panning so I don't
see myself stopping in the near future
but once I am done with it like I'm
gonna be done with it I don't I don't
know I don't see myself stopping but if
there's ever a point where I want to and
I feel like my collection is down I'm
not saying that couldn't happen and I am
open to that as well number 10 would you
recommend project panning to others how
would you explain it yes I completely
recommend project panning to everyone I
think that whether you feel like you
have a problem or you just like love
makeup and buy I just
think that it is so interesting and it's
you feel accomplished when you finish
products up and you also get to realize
again how long it takes to use up items
like a blush takes forever if you have
even if you only have seven blushes it
takes a year to like use up a blush
really honestly so you have seven years
worth of blush I have like sixty years
like I could die and I wouldn't be able
to use up all my blushes so I just think
that anyone could take project panning
and make it work for them or like take
something from it and I don't know how I
would explain it other than like how I
explained it to you guys and how I kind
of explained it in my like five ways to
stop buying makeup but it's just a way
to for me to use up my items to feel
like it got my money's worth out of
items and to really know if I like a
product or not like a product so I don't
know I don't even know makes sense
but yeah that is the tag I really
enjoyed just talked with you guys and I
am excited to do more tag videos I've
done a couple now and I think they're
just really fun I also want to do a QA
eventually I think I want to do it once
I hit 5,000 subscribers but I don't know
I just I kind of thought of that just
because this is like just straight-up
questions and it's kind of fun to just
tell you guys how I feel about stuff and
hopefully you guys enjoy it I don't know
I felt like at least at 5,000 there
would be enough people actually
interested in my answers to questions so
I hope you guys enjoyed I will talk to
you in my next video again go check out
Jacqueline's channel I'll have it linked
down below of course and I'll see you
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
