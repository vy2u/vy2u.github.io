is going to be a video that everyone
kind of requested but I had mentioned
doing and everyone's a lot of people not
everyone I guess but a lot of people had
said they wanted to see it so this is
going to be my perfume collection these
are the perfumes that are currently in
my collection I am trying to work
through them because not all of these
are my favorite scents and there are
some perfumes that I want to buy I would
say that I go in spurts sometimes I'm
really into perfumes and I want to tell
other times I just don't care about them
and I could take them or leave them so
I'm gonna do my best to describe them so
forgive me I will actually try to start
linking stuff in the downbar I had
someone to comment like hey leave what
you're wearing in your bottom bar and so
I know I should do that I'm just a
little not lazy but it's like I didn't
want to do that until I had to because
it's a lot of time so if that's what you
guys want I'll totally do it I just was
trying to kind of like bide my time and
go as long as I could without doing it
so I will start doing that for you guys
anyway enough rambling let's get in to
this video I'm gonna start off with this
one this is Jessica Simpson's fancy love
I think it's the original I'm not really
sure this was just a complete impulsive
weird buy I was with my friend Ross and
I wanted the new perfume and at Ross you
can't smell the perfumes they're all in
these like locked boxes and I haven't
ever smelled this but I thought that the
packaging was pretty and I wanted a new
perfume it was $25 for the big one and I
thought $25 is a lot of money but it's
not like a ton of money and if I hate it
oh wow like it can't be that bad and I
just kind of risk it I rolled the dice
and got it I do enjoy this scent had I
smelt it before I bought it I'm not sure
if I would but it's a kind of a clean
scent a little bit warm not quite ambery
but more like amber and clean put
together if I had to describe it this
scent reminds me of fall and winter
because I would always when I first got
this I think it was around that time and
I would spray it on my like sweaters and
stuff so my scarves and my sweaters it
just reminds me of getting this perfume
and wearing this perfume for that even
though the scent isn't my favorite still
has this like weird memory association
attached to it so I do enjoy this
perfume I'm currently like right here on
it so I have a lot to go but I do enjoy
it it wasn't a complete like waste and
yeah that's the first one this next one
is one of my favorite perfumes this is
Viva La Juicy Lafleur so it is the like
more floral version of evil ahjussi Viva
La Juicy is quite sweet but with this
like floral twist on it it just cuts it
a little bit I mean it's still very
sweet but it just gives up that little
bit of a floral scent so it's just not
so sickeningly sweet I got this through
sephora's like perfume boxes what they
do is like a perfume sampler that's what
it is
so they do perfume sampler and you get
to sample all these perfumes into little
vials and then you get to pick the one
that you want for the full-size or the
1.7 ounce or whatever they have decided
and this was like the biggest one on
there and it was I knew going in that I
was going to get this one anyway so the
sampler is 50 dollars and I think by
itself this is 70 so I was saving money
getting it that way and it gave you the
full-size because I think this one comes
in one size this is 2.5 fluid ounces so
I thought that was an amazing deal a way
to try out other perfumes and get this
for even cheaper than I would if I just
straight-up bought it I love this scent
I mean I haven't used a ton of it but it
is one of my favorite ones it's quite
potent and it stays throughout the day
which I really like so the packaging -
so cute
it's so cute this is a perfume from
L'Occitane it is the rose Aurora
Oh from fresh a I don't know I got this
in Paris when we were with Sam when I
would we were with Sam when me and Sam
were with Sam when I was with Sam for is
when we got engaged we went for my
birthday but then we got engaged in
France so actually I have like an
engagement video Sam made me for my
birthday still like a one-year
anniversary afterward if you guys want
me to post it let me know
but anyway it's so cute anyway so this
is
a rose scented perfume it smells very
good I bought this because it was on
sale in the shop plus like you know we
were in Paris and it was fun and I just
wanted to buy stuff and have a good time
and love Allah not that I regret this
purchase but I definitely haven't like
really ever used it so I really want to
bust this out when it comes to like
spring and summer and try to use some of
this up this next coming up year I do
enjoy this scent I just I don't
gravitate toward it and as much as my
other sense I guess and so yeah that's
this one though it smells like just like
roses it's like basically just roses
this is Marc Jacobs dot and this is like
the big size I got this in San Francisco
when I was with Sam and my mom I don't
know pretty sure he got it in San
Francisco though pretty sure or at least
I remember spraying it on myself and so
for there this smells really really good
this also reminds me of like fall it's a
scent I definitely wear a lot in the
fall time I like a halfway done with
this perfume I don't know how to
describe it it's we it just smells good
I like this I don't like the honey one
and I really like Marc Jacobs fragrances
I think he does a great job and this
one's really really great I love it this
is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana white
fragrance I bought this right before my
wedding and I bought this in Daisy dream
which I've already done with the Daisy
Dream actually my mom bought me Daisy
Dream for like a wedding gift that's
what I wore on my wedding day this one
smells really good it's very clean scent
I do like this scent but I like how it
matures on my skin more than when I
first spray it it's quite strong the
packaging is absolutely beautiful I
don't regret this purchase but I have
not used it nearly as much as like my
like diehard favorites like Marc Jacobs
Daisy Marc Jacobs Daisy dream those two
are like my top two I love those ones
it's quite a like a clean scent I guess
I would say definitely clean compared to
the black fragrance which is a lot more
like sensual and dark and amber and not
my type of scent I have two fragrances
from Gilly Hicks now I made an order
from Gilly Hicks for like body Springs
and these two perfumes these were like
ten dollars a piece I don't know what
possessed me to but what even possessed
me to go on that website
but I went there and I bought this stuff
and these are from like Billy Hicks
Sydney so it's from Australia I think I
don't know if them stores here in
America but anyway it's kinda like an
amber combi type of situation um anyway
this is the second darling Hurst so
these I bought without knowing this is
kind of a spicy scent and it's kind of
like think of Abercrombie but for girls
spicy's a little sweet but not like
musky really more clean and preppy
that's what this smells like
it is really nice I've used some of it
um it's definitely not a scent it
probably would have bought if I if I it
smelled it but it smells good it does
smell good this one is point Piper
this one is more Colonia definitely like
Darlinghurst better than this one this
one doesn't smell nearly as good I can't
even describe it it's just kind of
powdery but kind of cologne II but for a
woman and kind of an Abercrombie just
think of those types of sins that you
would smell like walking past their
store that's what this smells like plus
a little powder these descriptions these
scent descriptions I only have like two
more there is one that I don't have with
me because I can't find it right now but
it's my Bulgari omena coral it's in like
a red packaging it's quite ornate
packaging as well I love that sense that
is also one of my like top three
favorites
I love that scent I get compliments on
that scent it's absolutely beautiful and
it's a repurchase I just wanted to
mention it before I forgot this is Ralph
Lauren's I say Ralph Lauren does anyone
else say it that way let me know this is
Ralph Lauren's romance and it's just a
small bottle this one smells really good
really clean it reminds me of high
school because I really liked it then I
had a bottle and I got stolen so I
people are so annoying but this smells
just really nice really fresh and clean
those are the types of since I like I
like florals I like sweet signs I like
fresh suns and if you can mix those all
together then it's like a homerun hit
out of the park so that's this one it's
just a small one so I need to use that
up and then this one is totally not like
me I remember in high school this came
out this is Hilary Duff's with love
fragrance I saw this at lacrosse or
something just in this really small
point five ounce bottle and I just had
to
from memories sake this is definitely a
warmer sense little musky it has like a
weird mint scent at the end like under
notes or whatever you want to call it
but I just bought this for reminiscing
and I will use this up this winter just
to get it out but I had this scent like
such a long time ago I remember just
like wanting fragrances when I was like
in high school like that was like the
thing like my freshman year it was like
having all these different perfumes and
so when I saw that I was like oh my gosh
I remember it so I bought it it was like
eight dollars or something anyway those
are some of the sense that I have in my
collection now a few cents that again
aren't in here but that it absolutely
love our Marc Jacobs Daisy Marc Jacobs
Daisy dream I also love gel malone's
raspberry and bay leaf or something oh
that is like seriously one of my top
favorite perfumes as well and then some
perfumes that I'm looking at wanting to
get I really want to get the molecule
perfume so many people come into my
store with that perfume and it smells so
so good so I definitely want that it's
on my Christmas list and then another
perfume that I'm kind of looking at is
think it's Gucci's flora it smells so so
good I really like that scent as well
just to kind of give you guys like an
overview of like what I have what I've
used in the past what I want to use
those are kind of my scent preferences
so that is my perfume collection video I
guess I'll show you really fast - I
store all my perfumes it's so dusty and
disgusting so I probably shouldn't show
it but I store all my perfumes on this
like antique little tray it's a mirror -
tray about to set the thrift store I
thrifted it and I store all my perfumes
on here they look absolutely beautiful
especially with all their little
different bottles and everything
reflected off the mirror they're really
pretty and I thought I just show that in
really really fast that is everything
this video is entirely too long but I
hope you guys enjoy and let me know what
some of your favorite perfumes are
especially if you have the same scent
taste as me I'd love to know what
perfumes like go smell at Sephora or
check out and that's everything let's
end this video by eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
