Lauren thank you so much for watching
I've talked to no one today so my voice
sounds horrible today I wanted to do a
new project pan this one is going to be
kind of a year long thing but it's all
surrounding perfume samples I have so
many perfume samples it's crazy I feel
like my lips are I love this lip gloss
good I feel like it's betraying me
hopefully we can make it through the
video with that lip gloss looking
horrendous because it's so pretty but
then also a demon so anyway what I was
saying is this project is focusing on my
perfume samples these are all of them I
put them in this like bigger container I
have 64 of them which is quite a few I
used to have so many more than that but
I've decluttered so many basically the
inspiration for this is just try to use
up as many of these as I can this year
last year I moved out so many of my
full-size perfume bottles and I think I
only have 7 perfumes at the moment which
i think is pretty good a lot of them are
pretty close to being done as well so I
really want to try these out see if I
like them before they go bad hopefully
they aren't bad yet some of these are
really old some of these are newer so
yeah I want to just kind of roulette
style pick these out kind of like LS is
lipstick roulette but with perfumes I'm
going to pick 7 of these every single
time I do one of these videos and then
I'm going to test them out for me I feel
like this is actually doable I don't
have to put too much time into it but I
can actually get it done to see progress
and decide if I like these samples and
if I don't like something I'm not going
to finish it up I have no need to do
that I just want to like use these and
not let them go to waste but also see if
I can find some really awesome perfumes
I really want to have a perfume
collection that I absolutely love that
everything in it is something that just
is so exciting to me so that is
something I am working on attaining
hopefully in the next couple of years as
I work through what I have and I buy
some nice things that I know I will love
anyway I think that's I mean I don't
know what else to really say for this
project I'm gonna do updates whenever I
finish things probably every like two
months or so I think monthly is a little
excessive we'll see as it goes how that
works
so yeah I guess we just started up guys
alright
the first one is pratas candy so that
one's pretty good I have use that one
okay haha
the next one is Pradas candy but the
black top so I don't know what that
means I know that I like and enjoy
pratas candy so I'm not going to force
one of those alright next is product
candy just kidding
this is replicas Beachwalk that will be
a nice one I'm excited to try that one
out I feel like it looks like I've
already used it up but I haven't used
this before it has like half of it gone
okay okay next is coach poppy this is a
fragrance that I remember when I first
came out I was like oh I love it
I would smell it in like magazine ads
and everything so I'm excited to see if
I still like this hopefully it's not bad
that'll be a fun one I feel like most of
these I'm actually going to either like
or I'm interested in trying since I have
already in the past too cluttered all
the sense that I knew probably weren't
gonna work for me or I just wasn't into
so that's kind of a nice feeling okay
the next one I'm really excited about
this is Joe Malone's nectarine blossom
and honey I love Jo Malone fragrances if
I could buy all of her fragrances I
would so this one I'm excited to you
know test out and use up the next one is
aqua digi Ola I think it's how you say
it and I believe this is a Giorgio
Armani fragrance so that one should be
nice probably really clean but again
this one looks like I've used it in the
last one this is Atelier colognes in Sud
Magnolia what do you think is like South
Magnolia I don't know I don't know if
Magnolia is like a different word in
French but Sud I believe is South I
think anyway this one is not a sprayer
this one is gonna take a little bit more
time again though if I don't like
something I'm not gonna force myself up
but I can't wait to come back report to
you tell you what I liked what I didn't
like I'll show you guys the empties I
really think that if I'm diligent I can
get through almost all of these this
year I think it's doable because I don't
always have to use them all up if I'm
not feeling them so yeah I hope you guys
are doing this project I know it's kind
of a weird one but this is a personal
one for me since I have so many
the samples and I find that I never
reach for them I also have a ton of
roller balls I just have a lot to work
through so I thought this would
hopefully help me get rid of some of
this clutter I get these samples so
often from Sephora or wherever I order I
usually choose these because I want to
try any perfume and they seem like a
good deal sometimes it's just like
lotions and random crap so I find
perfumes make me feel like it's a
worthwhile sample but then I end up just
hoarding them and never using them which
then it's just trash in my house so
anyway I'm excited to try these seven
and I can't wait to update you guys in
about two months or so and that's
everything for this video I will see you
babes in my next one have a kitane bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
