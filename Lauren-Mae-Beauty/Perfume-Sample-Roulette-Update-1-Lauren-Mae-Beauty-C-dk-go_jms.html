Lauren thank you so much for watching if
you're wondering about this eye look I
do have a get ready with me on it I'm
not wearing glasses in that but I just
wanted to see I'll leave my glasses link
down below in case you have questions I
usually get someone asking what they are
and stuff so they're super cute I love
them these are what I wear every single
day of my life because I am blind if you
guys know I need glasses I'm really bad
really really really bad eyesight and
that's the intro to this video we're
gonna be doing an update to the perfume
sample roulette that I started I'm gonna
leave the original video link down below
so you guys can check it out I started
this project so that I can try to use up
the like 60 plus samples that I had in
my perfumes and actually tried these
things before they go bad I feel like
I'm just like hoarding them and I don't
know why it's like I feel like I don't
want to get rid of them but I don't want
to use them so I thought this would be a
fun way to try out different perfumes
see if I like something if I don't and
just get an idea of my scent profile I
think that's kind of cool so last time I
picked seven different fragrances so I'm
gonna come back to you guys let you guys
know if I like them if I didn't what my
thoughts are I also did take snapshots
of the notes so I'm going to like read
you little descriptions because there's
no way I'm gonna be able to give you a
really good idea of what they smell like
it would just be me saying like the same
words over and over and I already do
that enough of my videos we don't need
to like do it with perfumes I was able
to use up every single perfume except
for one but I did add another one in
here so I have 7 used and one that it's
just gonna take me forever because this
one doesn't have a sprayer it's just
like a little vial a lot of you guys
said to put this in the bath and that is
a great idea the only thing is like I'm
just gonna be like I always try to keep
it real and so to be real one I don't
have that nice of a bathtub so it's like
I don't really want to sit in it but -
it's just like a normal sized bathtub
and I'm not necessarily normal science
I'm a lot bigger and just sitting in
there really it's just like my legs are
covered it's just like awkward and weird
I've tried taking baths I just need like
a nice big like spa tub really for that
to happen so until that happens I won't
be taking baths with the perfumes
I think you guys might be able to hear
the music but I can't control it so
we're just gonna have a little
background tune oh it's like it's like a
nice little country song so it'll be
fine so I'm going to talk about the Jo
Malone fragrances first so the one that
I picked and actually chose in the
project this is the nectarine blossom
and honey Cologne and let me give you
some notes the website says London's
Covent Garden early morning market
succulent nectarine peach and cassis and
delicate spring flowers melt into the
note of a cassia acacia honey we're
gonna hear me butcher a million things
if you guys don't know I'm like I suck
at saying things it's not me trying to
be like stupid or not like intelligent I
just suck and I can't spell either so
for all the people who like will be like
hey you spelled this wrong whether it's
just me like typing too fast or because
I really literally thought is that way
you're the real MVP I appreciate you
anyway sweet and delightfully playful
now available in a larger size this is
really nice I really enjoyed it it's a
light like definitely you can smell the
nectarine but it's light and refreshing
it's not too much I don't think it's
overly sweet but it's definitely like
more of a sweet fruity scent really
enjoyed it I would love to have a little
bottle of this in my perfume collection
I would definitely use it up and enjoy
it the one that I added in here because
I found this in my purse and thought I
would just you know use it all the way
up is the Earl Grey and cucumber Cologne
this is a British tradition afternoon
tea a fragrance with a burst of bergamot
distinct - Earl Grey and the cool
succulents of crunchy cucumber
counterpoise with a sweet base of
beeswax vanilla and musk reviving and
refined really nice enjoyed this - if I
had to pick one I'd probably go with the
nectarine one but my all-time favorite
scent from them is blackberry and Bay
that one just is so nice
it's like the perfect mix of everything
I love it so much and then the one I
have currently is the English oak wood
and red currant and I do enjoy that one
it's not as good as blackberry in bay
but it's still really nice but overall I
honestly really just loved Jo Malone
fragrances I find that they're really
nicely balanced and interesting but
still wearable and not overwhelming
they're just really good next let's talk
about replicas Beachwalk this is
something I was excited because the
notes of this or what it describes
itself as are rays of light Sun heaps
on the skin a taste of salt and
sunscreen at the end of the day a stroll
along the ocean feet sink into the sand
waves brush the skin the Sun at its
zenith radiates the beach each walk
invokes the memory of a summer day I
definitely get the notes of like the
beach and all of that but this is not my
type of fragrance I don't know I just I
wanted to be a little bit more coconuty
I want this slightly sweeter I find that
this turns really floral and just like
kind of powdery almost on my skin so it
was something I really wanted to like
but didn't so I would not purchase that
I didn't hate it and I can smell the
sunscreen but it also smells really
powdery and I don't like that next we're
gonna be talking about aqua d g OA I
think it may be how you say it this is
described as there is a charming
sensation from the very first notes of
this floral fragrance which are carried
along in a deliciously heady current of
crushed mint
hmmm with a zest of Italian Lamone
Lamone primo of your femenina laughs M&amp;amp;L
oh I regret this decision so much just
so you guys know of reading out these
names okay let me retry that with a zest
of Italian Lamone primo your seminal Oh
mmm I didn't do an accent I'm sorry
harvested from the first spring blossoms
in Calabria Calabria I'm gonna skip
around so you don't sound like an idiot
this has signatures in the water rooted
in the earth it has cedarwood heart
sprinkled with sensuous brown sugar and
it has some animal notes to it
a beautiful fresh scent ideal for warm
season I definitely agree that this will
be great when I'm in Italy or something
like that it's just kind of like has
definitely this like lemon citrus scent
to it it's very fresh and refreshing and
just nice it's clean it's not too sweet
I really enjoyed this
I don't know again if I purchase this
but I definitely enjoyed it I don't know
I need to use perfumes for like a long
time before I know that was I'm so sorry
I don't even know how many
edit that through because like I
butchered that to death I ended up
picking two of the product candies that
it had this just has some like top notes
and stuff so the top note is caramel the
mid notes are powdery notes and must and
the base notes are vanilla product candy
is instantly seductive pure pleasure
wrapped in impulsive charm in an
explosion of shocking pink and gold
Prada candy takes us on a walk on the
wild side showing us a new facet of
prada femininity where more is more and
excesses everything yeah definitely
accesses everything this is very very
sweet it's very very strong it's
something I actually really enjoyed it's
a great like winter warm candy scent I'm
not someone who usually likes a warmer
scent but I think the sweetness of this
kind of off puts the musk for me because
I'm not usually too - in the Musk's but
I did enjoy this this is something that
I think would be really nice to have it
smells really really good it lasts for a
really long time too
so I did like that I have two more cents
to talk about next we're gonna talk
about Coach poppy this is something I
remember smelling in like magazines and
like you'll be wanting and liking it
says coach poppy opens with bright
cucumber juicy Mandarin and freesia bud
notes heart is filled with an aroma of
jasmine pink water lily southern
gardenia red candied rose petals and
Prem Brule Accord bass note is a mixture
of cedar wood sandalwood vanilla and
marshmallow and this is really nice this
is very similar to me to the product
candy like I like Prada candy butter
this is a little bit like cheaper and a
little bit more fresh instead of just
candy this has that like yeah Mandarin
in it I can definitely smell that and
like it's something a little bit more
yeah light and bright but it definitely
has like a warm sweet under note to it
I enjoyed this a lot I thought it was
really nice again don't know if I'd
purchase it it's not like my favorite
scent profile but it's really nice and
last was something I was surprised I
liked actually I didn't think I would
this is Atelier colognes said Magnolia
and this is a completely unexpected
experience inspired by ingredients from
regions where water and sky become one
said Magnolia is a floral and fresh
fragrance with notes of magnolia from
Louisiana bitter orange and atlas cedar
wood from Morocco the sharp tang of
citrus blooms into a grand floral
celebration the woody dry down is
reminiscent of antebellum elegance and
nights of warm abandoned this warm
floral fragrance is exclusive to Sephora
really nice I thought this was just only
going to be really floral but it doesn't
have that like citrus to it which is so
nice I really enjoyed this I thought it
was really nice this is an insanely
expensive perfume it's like up there
with Joe Malone so I don't think I could
ever purchase this but I did enjoy this
surprisingly I was really surprised okay
oh my gosh can we just pick a new
perfume so I'm gonna pick seven more I
believe I think I'm just going to start
like collecting the ones that are not
sprayers to the side because I'm gonna
still try them but I'm not gonna force
myself to use those up as it just takes
a little bit longer so anyway let's use
it first one is Marc Jacobs decadence
this is like the newer one I believe
from him where it looks like a purse
almost so I'm excited to try that out I
love Marc Jacobs easy it's like one of
my all-time favorite one so I'm excited
next we have Ralph Lauren romance I
really like this scent I actually have a
small bottle of this currently so maybe
it'll like inspire me to freaking finish
that up because I've had it a long time
this is definitely more clean like a
clean fragrance so I like something just
a little a tinge of fruit or something
else but I think that it'll be nice
hopefully I like it if not I might
declutter that perfume I don't know
we'll see I'll make a decision all
righty next we have oh this is a new one
this is Chloe our roses to Chloe so I'm
excited to try that out roses can be hit
or miss for me like they're too flowery
I don't like them or like powdery I
don't like this
this is Amazon Lily from nest and this
is probably gonna be a little bit deep
in musky for me but we'll try it out I
have four more to pick no.3 word cake we
have another product candy I had a lot
of those samples next we have Katy Perry
Killer Queen really sweet kind of a
musky like under bass though too this
one will be easy to go through one more
and last year we got flora by Gucci and
I actually really like this this is one
of my favorite scents
I've never had this in a full-size but I
really really love it this is a buy
although it's not in a spray so it's
gonna take a while to use it okay guys
that is everything for my perfume sample
roulette I hope you guys enjoyed I know
this is a very specific project but it's
kind of fun I hope that it inspires you
to maybe use up some of your samples I
don't know why I just think it's gonna
take forever to use them up but it
really doesn't it's like for me usually
two to three times and it's gone so it's
kind of fun trying a different scent and
like being a different person or
something uh that sounded really weird
but anyway that's everything thank you
so so much for watching guys and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
