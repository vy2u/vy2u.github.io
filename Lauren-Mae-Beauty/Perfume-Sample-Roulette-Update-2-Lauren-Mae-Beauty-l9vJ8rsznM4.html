Lauren thank you so much for watching
today we're gonna be doing a long
awaited perfume sample roulette I don't
know if you guys are waiting for it but
I know on my end I've been like gosh I
need to film that update so this is it
if you guys haven't seen the beginning
of this project I'm gonna leave it link
down below but I basically just started
this so that I could use up my little
perfume sample vials I just start
hoarding them and collecting them and I
realized I wasn't going through them so
I thought this project would be a fun
way to try out different perfumes figure
out my scent profile while using them up
so as you guys know I picked out seven
samples last time and it had one roll
over so I'm gonna go through these I'm
gonna let you guys know the fragrance
notes I did take like screenshots of the
different scents and what they are and
all that just because I cannot describe
these to you I'm telling you it will be
horrible with that also from last video
when I did this I can't pronounce like
literally anything so just be warned
that I'm gonna butcher everything
probably will see I'll try to skip
around I'll try to edit stuff out
because honestly I watched that video
back and it's painful
besides that let's just get into it
because seriously it's just perfume I
want to start off by saying I found a
really awesome little thing at Daiso so
this is it it's a little sprayer and you
can just twist the top off so I've been
using this for any of my vials that are
just like you know don't have a sprayer
on it I can turn them into having a
sprayer which has been amazing and
really helps me get through those
perfumes that you're supposed to just
like dab on not take forever I love this
so this is really awesome if you are
doing something similar or wondering I
thought this was a great little thing I
got way too excited honestly what I
found this at the store was like oh my
gosh it's perfect for me too excited
that all being said the fragrance that I
put in here is Gucci flora
they describe this scent as a subtle
sophisticated floral fragrance inspired
by princesses from the past present and
future the flora Dona is a young classic
and refined woman with the Gucci edge of
power and sensuality it says it's notes
are citrus accord peony rose osmanthus
flower pink pepper sandalwood and the
style of this is elegant natural
spontaneous so I love this this is one
of my favorite scents that I've never
purchased but I always do really like
smelling I'm an old store I would spray
this almond kind of a lot this is very
fresh and floral but it almost smells
kind of like a sophisticated Garnier
Fructis like conditioner or something
like in a very sophisticated way though
it has like just similar vibes to me but
I actually enjoy this and I think it
smells really great so I enjoyed using
this up we picked another product candy
so this is the third little product
candy I've used up in this project
already but just to remind you this is a
warm and spicy scent it says the key
notes are white musk benzine and caramel
Accord and it says Prada candy is a
fragrance with a novel olfactory balance
combining exceptionally high quality
ingredients in excessive proportions
magnified by white mas noble benzine
comes together in a modern caramel
Accord to give the fragrance a truly
unique signature basically with this
thing they're like XS is everything and
that is a very good explanation of this
scent it's a very sweet scent but
there's something about it that has that
like warmth and like kind of musk to it
I do enjoy this it's definitely more
like a winter scent to me it kind of
like wraps you up you feel really just
comforted by it so I do enjoy this I
don't know if I'd ever purchase it
honestly for this scent it's just so
effing expensive I do like it but it's a
very expensive fragrance I think it's
good for like a little spray rollerball
or like a scent bird type of situation
where I have a small amount that I can
actually work through and move on to
other things but I do like this next we
have Killer Queen and I believe this
scent is discontinued it's like hard to
find it you can get around like Amazon
and stuff so it was kind of hard to find
the notes on it but it says its top
notes include wild berries dark plum and
bergamot Accords the main note of the
heart is velvety red flower but there
are also some Bach samba jasmine and
rainbow plumeria the base contains
cashmere patchouli and liquid praline
I remembered liking this more honestly I
felt like this is a very similar thing
to like basically like a mix of like
Prada candy and flower bomb I don't know
why I think that but that's kind of like
how I remembered it like it smells
really good it's not my normal fragrance
like style but it still smells good but
when I wore this I just didn't really
enjoy it so this is not something I
would purchase it was just okay like it
was fine I could use it up but it's not
that great the next scent that I have
here is roses de Chloe by Chloe and the
is a floral fragrance with bergamot
damascena Rose essence and amber musk it
says it's Airy
luminous subtle like thousands of petals
from a bouquet of fresh cut roses roses
de Chloe is an imitation to graze it
says freedom lightness and femininity so
it's basically this is like if you love
roses if you love the scent of roses
this is like the perfect rose scent it's
not much else than that it's not too
sweet it's not to like you know too
floral where it smells powdery so I
enjoyed this it's just not something
that I need in my life but if you love
roses I definitely suggest checking it
out because it's just a fresh really
nice ro scent so yeah that's roses to
Chloe let's talk about one I did not
like this is the Marc Jacobs decadence
scent this was something I couldn't even
use up so I'm going to be decluttering
this and passing it on it says it's in
the floral family it's like a warm
floral with Italian plum Bulgarian rose
Jasmine Sembach sandbox which is the
same thing in that Killer Queen so maybe
that's something I don't like and liquid
amber it says it brings his irreverent
aesthetic to a new level of glamour and
luxury with decadence essential
fragrance as intoxicating as the woman
who wears it decadence seduces with
sultry top notes of succulent Italian
plum wrapped in golden saffron and Bella
D iris flower and blooms into an
extravagant okay of Bulgarian roses and
creamy Jasmine it's just not my I just
really just dislike this it was just too
heavy for me
I didn't like the floral I'm not someone
who usually gloves are really warm
fragrance so that definitely could be it
like amber patchouli those things aren't
usually things that resonate with me I
like fresh floral yeah more fresh floral
fruity type of stuff so yeah I didn't
like this I was expecting to like this a
little bit more because I do love Daisy
but it makes sense for him to have like
other types of fragrances in his line so
I would stick to Daisy or Daisy dream or
even I like dot that one's a little bit
like heavy and really sweet for me but I
do I love Daisy so good the next perfume
is something that actually really
surprised me I remember trying an S
perfume I think it was in like
night something and I didn't like it
because it's just too deep too
I just didn't it wasn't my scent you
know so I think I took that into this
fragrance but this is Amazon Lily it has
lime tangerine driftwood and musk and
the combination of these notes creates a
refreshing floral that is energizing and
uplifting and so I didn't realize it was
going to be like a light fresh floral
and I really did enjoy this again the
notes are lime tangerine Amazon lily
driftwood and musk and the style of this
is radiant fresh and uplifting and so
smelling this and light yeah it has that
line I can definitely smell that citrus
throughout it it kind of just like Peaks
out and it has that musk but it's just
enough to kind of ground it and give it
some complexity and depth so I enjoyed
this I don't know if I'd purchase it but
I just was happily impressed with it and
enjoyed it while I wore it and the last
one that I have here is Ralph Lauren
romance this is a woman's fragrance that
invokes the timeless essence of falling
in love discover the sensual essence of
velvety woods extravagant florals and
seductive musk the notes on this are sun
goddess rose okay marigold ginger
chamomile oil yellow freesia white
violet lotus flower day lily patchouli
oak moss and musk and this style is a
timeless scent for all seasons this is a
very fresh scent I feel like this could
almost be universal or what is that
gender neutral I don't know I feel like
men could wear this maybe it'd be a
little bit sweet but honestly this is
very like just fresh to me I do have
like a medium size of this in my
collection it's not something I loved
wearing I kind of like it as it warms up
on my skin but just up front it's just
very overpowering I can only spray a
couple sprays of this and I'm someone
who's like going crazy dousing myself so
I definitely have to use this very
sparingly but it is a nice scent I do
like it
it's just definitely not like a favorite
a must-have for me and we still got a
tilia colognes Sud Magnolia to go
through but now that I have that dye so
little sprayer I think this will be easy
to go through I just haven't cleaned it
out yet and put this in so I'll be
carrying this over
now little that's ten let's pick seven
new perfumes to go through so that we
can move on with this video the first
fragrance that I picked here is replicas
lazy Sunday morning so that'll be
interesting I think like replicas a
brand I really want to like but honestly
I haven't found anything yet from them
that I'm just in love with so hopefully
we can find something through this
project number two we have misdeal Oh
blooming bouquet it's like a specific
type I didn't really mention at the
beginning of this video I thought my
hair looked cute like messy cute that's
definitely my aesthetic is like I like
looking kind of like messy but like you
know your makeups done I'm kind of
regretting that decision now I see
myself in the monitor so sorry about
that girl number three this is Pasi
flora from ness so I'm excited to try
this now that I liked Amazon Lily and
see what that one's about number four is
another Atelier and this is pomelo
Paradis so I think pomelo
no that's Pamplemousse I was gonna be
like that's grapefruit so I think pomelo
is just pomelo that's its own fruit
right anyway I'm gonna try that one out
alright this is the fifth one Prada
freakin candy
number six is Oh Hermes and this is
Jardin on jardin certainly nil I don't
know what is that garden on the
something I think and the last fragrance
I have here is and why are my NY by DKNY
Donna Karen New York I think that's a
nice mix of perfumes I'm excited to work
through even more I do have some updates
when it comes to numbers I think I've
used up fourteen vials now which is
super exciting I originally started off
with 64 and now I'm only down to 61
because I have gotten perfume samples in
since I started this project so I'm a
little sad that there doesn't seem like
more progress but I know I would easily
be into the 70s 80s if I hadn't been
working on these perfumes so that is
exciting I guess I just wish you could
see more reflection in the numbers when
we really like get down to it but
hopefully with this one and the next
time I can you know work down
I'm not gonna be ordering too much more
the only thing I'm gonna order that
doesn't have to do with Italy I'm gonna
get that wet and wild collection I'm
gonna do the whole thing I just really
want it and it's so inexpensive
I just love inexpensive makeup it's my
fave and that's everything guys thank
you guys so much for watching my perfume
sample roulette I know it is like a
weird one but it's very personal to me
and it's really helping me get through
some just like clutter in my collection
so thank you so much for watching guys
and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
