thought today I would also film my perio
haul so these are all things that I got
in Peru
me and Sam kind of bought a lot of stuff
I really thought we weren't going to
like if I were gonna keep it to a
minimum but instead we went ham about
like everything because it is a lot
cheaper there to buy stuff they use so
lies I believe is how you pronounce ed
and it's like free so like separate
dollars so a lot of this stuff was you
know considerably cheaper than if we
were to buy something comparable here in
the United States so I'm just gonna show
you guys the different things that I got
a lot of it is like alpaca hair because
I'll pack a baby alpaca things like that
are really popular there they have a lot
of alpacas and so they make a lot of
their like textiles and clothing and
different things like that without
background this first thing is like a
little key chain but it has like a
little it's like a little hat I got this
for free because we bought a bunch of
stuff from some guy and he gave us these
so I'm gonna turn this into an ornament
I absolutely love ornaments I'm gonna do
an ornament video eventually into
Christmas once we get there because they
just love ornament me and Sam get
ornaments every time we go somewhere so
this is just like another keepsake to
put on a tree and I'm excited to turn it
into an ornament and not a keychain this
is another ornament that we got I really
liked this I thought it was really
sensitive I thought it'd look really
cute on the tree it has like two little
people on it I believe they're doing
like a dance that is like Peruvian I
believe that's what they told me but
yeah I think this is really cute it's
just another little ornament let's get
the small things out of the way I also
got two of these little magnets I knew
I'm zoomed out more it's because I have
some bigger items that I want to show
you guys but this one's just like a
little moon with a star and then this
one here is a little llama or alpaca
super cute I really like them I thought
they were cute and they were like not
even a dollar each so yeah me and Sam
each got ourselves a pair of socks these
are like alpaca hair socks so they're
really warm and super cute Sam's a
yellow ones I'm the blue ones so we got
those for ourselves I also got these
headbands I used actually this one when
we went to Machu Picchu I was wearing
this I believe
I believe I wore this one maybe I wear
this one I can't remember they're just
like little headbands I thought it'd be
nice once it gets to winter this one's
like neutral so I thought it'd look good
and then this one's kind of crazy and
like a fun one
but those are really great and they
actually used one of them on the trip
which was nice because it was kind of
cold samples have got an alpaca scarf
it's super soft like alpaca especially
if it's baby alpaca they're really
really soft and so this one is a really
soft scarf for Sam anyway I can also got
a sweater but I'm not going to show you
cuz it's born who cares what it's all
about me we went to a chocolate factory
and not a chocolate factory a chocolate
Museum more like in Cusco so I did get
some cacao tea this does taste like like
chocolate it's crazy and it just like a
little but it's already sweet on a
dentist and a little bit of sugar I
thought this would be a good reminder
like throughout the holidays well it's
cold to be drinking this and reminding
myself of our trip in Peru I thought
that'd be nice
this is salt from the Mara's mine I
believe it's in the Sacred Valley and
they like the salt water like rains down
or whatever there and then it evaporates
and then salts left over so that's what
this is from this was like 2 so Lay's so
not even a dollar for this much salt and
we thought it would be nice just to have
again like to cook with it at home or
whatever now on to the last couple
couple of items there's like 5 or 6
items left still but they aren't like
food or clothing well they are clothing
some of them are textiles
I got this this is like a Peruvian kind
of like guy it reminded me of the
Emperor's New Groove
it says Peru on it I try to get some
type of like art or something while I'm
in a country too so we can kind of hang
that around our house if you can't tell
like my house is more I feel like
eclectic or um different than a lot of
other I mean not that I'm like a big
youtuber but like it's not just like
white IKEA furniture
I do have IKEA furniture but I like
black furniture and I I don't just have
like the traditional like stuff I like
stuff like this and then I'll mix it
with a floral print and I like it so
yeah I thought this would be really nice
I kind of want to hang it like above a
door in the bathroom or something I
don't know we also always tried to get a
photo album on our trips to put our
photos from the
trip inside of it so this one here is
really cool it's like leather work with
like textile material as well and I
thought this would be really nice to put
photos in I do want to scrapbook at the
trip and not just like put photos in
here which I might film as well I've
been really into scrapbooking lately so
I'm excited to kind of play around with
that and yeah do do something more fun
than just like slapping some photos in
here from the trip one of the bigger
items me and Sam decided to purchase
while there was an alpaca blanket so
this is it we wanted ones with little
llamas on it because which I realized
llamas and alpacas are different but I'm
gonna use them interchangeably this is
like alpaca fur but we wanted a blanket
from there so this is it it's quite
large it's so so soft and very warm it
was one of the things that Sam wanted
before we even left so we made sure to
get one and we got a pretty good deal I
think we only paid about like 40 us for
it which i think is amazing while there
I also picked this up um it's just a bag
and I wasn't expecting to get something
like this I just it was such a good deal
is only 10 so lays like 10 so lays it's
not even four dollars for this bag like
I thought it was really cute it's
neutral I don't know I just I thought it
was a good deal I didn't want to pass it
up sorry about the crinkling there's
bags in it but I really like it I think
it's really soft and gushy so I decided
to get that my mom got one too cuz they
were just it was too good of a deal
steal the deal and then my last big item
this was something I wasn't expecting to
get but I just fell in love with it
sometimes you see something and you just
can't say no oh there's one other thing
I'm a liar sometimes you just can't say
no so I didn't I said yes and I gave in
you can't even see me this is like the
weirdest thing this is a poncho so I
hope you guys can see the fabric it's a
really pretty fabric I really like it I
feel like ice queen woman in this which
I really love and then it has the alpaca
fur which is so soft and so because she
on the outside and it is an open poncho
I just feel like totally bomb in this I
love it so much so yeah it's like an
open poncho really pretty I thought for
winter I'd be really pretty with just
some blue jeans and like
plain white shirt or something it's
beautiful and it's so glamorous and I
just love it I'd obviously don't have
anything like this in my wardrobe but I
just really liked it I I love the color
even though it's not even completely
neutral just something about this
pattern was just so pretty to me I love
I just love it I love it so I'm really
happy I got this and then I guess I'll
show you the last thing I'll just keep
on my outfit the last thing I got was a
jewelry item this is what it looks like
I know it's kind of hard to show you I'm
so sorry that's what it looks like and I
didn't get this to actually wear on my
neck or anything I want to wear it as
like a headpiece I thought it'd be
really cute these are made out of like
not silver I know a lot of the jewelry
there is made out of silver it's really
nice and you can get some really good
like nice jewelry pieces there but I
just got like the cheapy the cheapy
stuff cuz I just thought it'd be so
pretty for on my head like how beautiful
is that I love it so I can just like
wear it about town and look like an
Indian princess that is everything I got
in Peru I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I probably I probably geez I can't
speak I probably will have a few more
like Peru type of themed videos as we go
away it's not too just like brag or
anything I just I want to do like a Peru
which will take a little bit to get that
footage together and kind of put up it's
just kind of a keepsake from me and my
mom and Sam and I you know I'd love to
share it with you guys but I also want
to do a video about like beauty items
that I actually use in Peru I know a lot
of us overpack I'm totally an
over-packer and I thought it'd be cool
to show a video of the things that I
actually used while on vacation and
those are the things that actually love
or reach for or that fit the situation I
was actually traveling to instead of
just packing everything like I'm sure
about the only one so I thought that
would be a cool video and I think that's
it so like three more Peru videos
potentially again let me know if you
want to see or which ones you want to
see the most or if you want to see the
one where I'm just kind of like talking
to you guys I just can't wait I have a
lot of updates to like tell you guys
about so I will do that in another
because I'm rambling so hard right now
anyway I will talk to you guys in my
next video and I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day thanks so much
for tuning in to my channel and
supporting me all the time you guys are
the best and I'll see you I'll see you
