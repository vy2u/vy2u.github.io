this is going to be my first ever plan
with me this is a spread I did on my own
actually saw my first spread ever I
didn't want to film it cuz he didn't
know if it go well or not so this was
the first one it was for the October
week the 5th through the 11th I was
inspired by these stickers and kind of
went with that black grey lime green
type of theme I really really liked the
way it came out I kind of wish I filmed
it cuz I think it's super cute I don't
exactly do mine like other people I
don't have a bunch of the stickers from
etsy site so a lot of these I have cut
out myself but anyway let's go on to
this week's spread my journal is the
happy planner from me and my big ideas I
did bind off their website so I'll link
that down below it looks just like the
Erin Condren one but it is like half the
price plus the biggest thing for me is
I'm going to Peru on the sixteenth and I
really wanted to plan in my planner
before then and the Erin Condren one is
kind of backed up in orders so I
couldn't order it and it'd be Karen time
so really I got this one mostly because
i'm impatient but if you are looking to
save some money this one is like half
the price and from everything i can see
online it is quite similar in
construction like everyone else I
totally on have taken everyone's ideas
they're so good so I've written down
just kind of different things that I
need to plan so I'm going to just take
those off and set them to the side
that's what the planner looks like
without all those things in so now I'm
going to take out the planner pages
which I don't know if the Erin Condren
does this but you easily can just pull
these up from the side and take out your
pages which makes planning so so easy
here's my way I'm going to plan it's
going to be october 12 through the 18th
again i also have some things that i
pulled out and pre prepared for this
spreads so these are kind of my color
themes i'm going for i have all my tools
here
some gel pens some tape and then I have
some like cut outs from different
scrapbook paper that I want to include
in this one for filler boxes I have
these here I thought these would be nice
to put in there plus some of them I can
draw on and then I have little punches
that I made to with paper that is
similar that I can use to drawn and
cover dates and do whatever I want that
way over here washi tape I have
basically every Halloween washi tape
that I own because I only get to use
them so many times for the month and
then for stickers i have a couple to
pull out on you so this one here some
pumpkins and then these are like poison
bottle labels but I thought they'd be
nice in the spreads so that's everything
I have to work with those would like
that's the color scheme just very
traditional black and orange and also a
little bit of like beige for my color
scheme let's get into this bun first off
I'm going to think i'm going to use
these two stickers here and kind of line
them up on the bottom like I want to
washi tape so I'm going to do that first
okay I think that looks super cute so
let's move on i'm going to start laying
down my squares in places that i think
people are cute and start planning that
way before I like glue everything down
those are them laid out I think because
I'm not going to necessarily follow like
morning afternoon or whatever I'm just
going to cover that with some washi tape
so i think i am going to switch off
between these two and i'm going to cover
those before I lay down those squares
that way this is behind us i'm going to
do
I'm going to use this to cut the sides
of the Washington
and then I'm going to put this one on
this in the middle
so now i'm going to just do that same
thing
you
you
so that's what they look like once you
have all the washi teeth down now I'm
going to go put this back in where I
want them and see what's going on
so I think that's where i'm going to put
those but i want to kind of put my other
things in wow I have it so whatever the
tree there I have to put it on the side
because that's how the paper was kind of
cut off so that's going to go there that
means i need to this
don't kind of switch that around to make
it work and then I also wanted to fit
this pumpkin but it's not going to fit
in just one square so i might have to
kind of put it
just in here
I'm just gonna put it in
like that because I'm just
that day anyway
so
so I like to do list or anything so then
that's what that looks like I like the
way that it looks so far I think I'm
going to keep the numbers last time I
did cover them up but i think i'm going
to keep them in this time so I'm going
to just glue this stuff down now that i
know i want it that way and then it'll
just be stuck there to want it to worry
i use this little like sticky thing that
I was like we want it to you when I step
down because it doesn't like these holes
in the paper I try to use as little as
possible because it does get expensive
but it is worth it not have a glue stick
pusher
you
ok so that's it all glued down they're
all stuffed to the pages so you guys
might have a problem of these like cover
the watch teeth but I just don't have
anything thinner right now and I just
can't be bothered at this point so um
yeah yeah I could make them i guess a
little bit shorter but i like I'm
totally fine if the way it looks I think
overall when you have everything on
there it looks nice let's move on I'm
going to blank this out and kind of make
it a packing to do list type of thing to
do that I'm going to use these stickers
my little things are stuck to it and I'm
going to just kind of cover-up you did
you a second one kind of right of the
same thing so then I'm gonna just put on
top of here like this and then i'm going
to put like packing or what i decided
i'm actually going to use this color i
just think that I necto this nicer so
plus it'll just be easier to write so
there is that i'm also going to go in
and decorate with stickers really fast i
know i have a lot of stuff going on but
I thought it'd be
to use some difference
i just added a few nothing too much just
something now i want to go in and kind
of start writing in my little things so
that way i know what's going on so on
here i'm just going to write the word
work and when i'm working on monday and
to do that he's going to be using a
sharpie
on this one I'm going to rape just like
a to-do list so that way if I have
anything that needs to get done I'll
have a place to live it you
are these guys I put on bullet holes for
it yeah
so that's my to-do list for the day and
then when I work which I know a lot of
people don't put when they work so many
of us just be so lucky and not have to
but fine to have to work next I'm going
to have one for school and these half
blood through a little bit I was going
to try to cover up all the ones up like
through but looks like I didn't really
care as as I planned so I'm gonna just
put a heart because I think it's cute
and I have that day I have school
just put that there are some times up
but like what the project is I just
don't remember what it is right now and
then this one i'm also going to put down
like a to-do list but i'm going to again
steal another one of these so that way
it doesn't
right on that I'm going to try this gel
pen that's in silver if you really work
so I'm gonna have to go over that with
sharpie but again another to-do list and
then on here i'm going to write i still
do have work this day it's just a store
meeting so i'm going to write on here
and I'm gonna add a little so that's
Tuesday all planned out let's go to go
and stay I forgot that it's mine is ants
eat your anniversary or actually the
state's something I make this one kind
of like a heart so instead of just a
to-do list I kind of erase the gel pen
because it doesn't stick and I'm going
to make a little harder and put our
eighth year anniversary let's move on to
wednesday for wednesday i just have work
from 8 30 25 that is it so i'm going to
again just take one of these i'm going
to put work up here
sometimes if I have something specific I
have to do at work I'll write it down in
here like send an email to this person
or whatever I can't think of anything I
have to specifically do at work besides
work so I'm going to leave that in then
up here i am going to make a to-do list
you
next for thursday i am off of work
thursday but i do have school so i'm
going to write in school i'll put school
on here and i'm going to put it in

forget it friday i have work i'm sure
but i don't know my schedule yet so I'm
going to leave one for work just write
it and up here and i am leaving on my
airplane so i think i might have a
little airplane stick off i'm going to
use this little airplane sticker from a
different tack just to signify that i'm
leaving that day I leave really like I
can still go to work in the morning like
there till five and then I'll meet my
mom at the airport so
I'm gonna write a little air

little thing for all the different items
I definitely want to bring on the
airplane with me I also need to order my
uber car so I'm going to sit for here
it's just fun so I'm going to kind of do
just a fun little thing i'm gonna add

one good to see Sam cuz I'm so excited
for that and it'll be so fun i'm gonna
put for Rooney to feel well of course

find it but all the times I would never
need a silver sharpie it's the only one
I could find so I'm gonna go back in and

silver sharpie as well as write our
anniversary here this is my finished
spread for October basically week to
