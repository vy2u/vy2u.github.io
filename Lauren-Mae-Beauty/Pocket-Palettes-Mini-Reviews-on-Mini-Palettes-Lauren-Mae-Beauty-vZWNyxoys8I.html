Lauren thank you so much for watching
today I wanted to talk to you guys all
about pocket palettes this is a video
that Liv loves makeup did a long time
ago I'm gonna leave that link down below
as well as her channel and I kind of had
some inspiration from that and I have
some just smaller palettes in my
collection I wanted to talk to you guys
about it's kind of just me giving you
some reviews and just bringing them up
I've noticed that lately I've been
gravitating to palettes that are smaller
that it can kind of fit in the palm of
your hand but that pack-a-punch I feel
like for a while everyone is really into
things like the morphe palette and I'm
not trying to shade anyone who likes
them but it's a lot of the same colors
and I find that if you have less colors
to work with you have to be more
selective about how those colors are
gonna work together what kind of color
story they're going to be telling and
that's kind of what I'm interested in
what's inspiring me lately so I thought
I would talk about some of the smaller
palettes in my collection how I use them
do I like them what I think's good about
them or bad about them and just kind of
talk about smaller palettes and I would
love to know some of the palettes that
you guys like in the comments all of
these aren't like quads though they all
have more than five shadows in them so I
still consider them like a palette like
a proper palette they're just mini forms
so also one last thing I do have a
tutorial on this look it's a palette
bingo this is pre filmed so right now I
should be in Italy when this is playing
so yeah I'm not really online but I am
on Instagram so if you guys want to
follow me there I'm gonna be doing
stories hopefully and showing you
pictures there so if you want to catch
up with me in more real time definitely
go check out my Instagram but other than
that that's enough of an intro let's get
into the mini palettes I mean I couldn't
not bring up the color pot palettes
first these are the twelve pan palettes
from colour-pop and as you can tell
they're pretty tiny when you compare
them to like longer palettes or just you
know bigger palettes out there I have
five of them I've bought four of them
and then this one I got in a boxy charm
so I mean I still bought it but I didn't
pick it out specifically I freaking love
these palettes you get twelve shadows
for $16 it's just amazing the quality is
so there I feel like the color stories
with these they kind of vary I don't
think you need all of them that's
I don't have all of them and I kind of
stopped collecting them because it was
kind of getting to that point but I have
some favorites out of here one of them I
think you can't get any longer because
it was limited edition but yeah let me
show you what I have this first one is
the most neutral one that I have and
it's called the I think I love you
palette this is perfect if you are
someone who loves to have a couple matte
colors and then do a really pretty
shimmer on the lid that's what this is
you have a matte transition you have a
little bit of a darker matte Brown a
matte black and then the rest are all
shimmery lid colors I think this is a
really beautiful palette it's perfect
for prom or a wedding or just everyday
kind of natural glam look so this one I
really enjoy the element of surprise
palette is the newest one to me because
I did just get this in a boxy charm by
the time this video is up I will have
had a 4 looks 1 palette so I'll leave it
linked down below but it's really pretty
it has that pop of pink in it but if you
cover that color up most of this is
pretty dang neutral so I really enjoy
this palette so far but I don't think
it's a must-have and something that's
really cool too if you guys didn't know
these are all in there magnetically so
you can't pop them out with a magnet and
then rearrange them however you want so
even if you don't want to keep all the
shadows or you don't want to keep you
know the packaging for whatever reason
or you want to condense them all into
one Z palette you can do that as well
it kind of gets rid of the pocket
palette situation but that's just
something to know the palette I'm
holding is the My Little Pony palette I
believe this is still available and I
think this is a pretty palette it's kind
of this weird colorful palette that's
still subdued though in some way I like
this I think you can get some really
cool looks out of it I've definitely
done some fun things with these blues
before so I I like this I don't regret
this purchase but I don't think it's a
must-have the fem rosa Karrueche and
color pop collaboration for the she
palette was a really pretty one this one
is limited edition so you can't get it
anymore
I think these colors are stunning and
beautiful although I don't tend to reach
for this that much I feel like these
colors just suit a darker skin tone
better which makes sense with who they
collabed with for me I just need to
bring in other color so it's not as much
of a like 1 palette look but I still do
really like these colors and last
I think my favorite one this and that I
think I love you palette this is the yes
please palette but it confuses you by
saying cute AF on the front mine is so
dirty so just don't judge me I use this
all the time I really really enjoy it it
has so many great mattes in here as well
as some nice shimmers this is very
similar to the Natasha de Nona sunset
palette you can tell with that yellow
but I think it's it's great this is one
of my favorite ones and again on those
palettes the formula is just so great
for the price it's not like you're
sacrificing quality for a cheaper
product they do an amazing job by
keeping the value really great for the
price next let's talk about some things
that are getting phased out these are
from Too Faced and these are their 9 pan
10 pallets I believe they are going to
stop doing them this way now that they
have they're kind of like new formatting
with the peach collection and the white
peach and now they've redone all their
natural love palettes so I have two here
the first one is the Too Faced natural
matte palette I actually picked this up
kind of recently and I mean within like
a year or so I don't know I really liked
it when I first got it and I've used it
quite a bit but it's definitely not a
must-have I think you have a lot of
these shades in other palettes I like
the fact that this was all matte and all
kind of lighter tones this definitely
works for fair skin really well but I
felt like the last couple times I've
used it I wasn't getting as good of a
blend and I don't know if that was just
me and not being careful enough or if
that is the quality of the shadow so I
definitely need to use them more but
it's not necessarily something that I
suggest and I don't know if they've
changed the formula with the new
packaging as well so that's something to
keep in mind and then the other one I
have here is so cute and one that has
been a favorite for a while I'm not sure
if it's still a favorite because I
haven't used it in a while honestly but
this is the Too Faced peanut butter and
jelly palette okay
packaging it wins it's so cute I love it
and I love the color story of this yes
it's mostly neutrals but then it has
that pop of purple and that purple is
just so pretty I know some people don't
like it but it gives just such a pretty
purple glow to the lids I feel like you
can use a base or do other things to
like build up that color if you really
want it full opacity but I like how it
gives this just some
different yeah I just I do love this
palette so I think I should do some
tutorials maybe I'll do four looks one
palette at some point with this one
although I don't know how different
they'll be it'll just be a way for me to
like use it multiple times and kind of
remember if I still love it or if it's
something that sadly it should kind of
be passed on I'm gonna talk about some
other older palettes here these are from
Stila and these are the eyes are the
window palettes so I have the soul
palette I know one of these is all matte
okay this is not the on that one this is
the most neutral out of all of the
palettes I believe that came out this
has a mix of mattes and shimmers it has
their all-time like best-selling shade
kitten in it I actually used this
palette on my wedding day so I kind of
have some like weird tie to it
although it's funny because I don't feel
like I would use it today on my wedding
day I also wouldn't do my makeup how I
did my makeup on my wedding day anyway I
think this is a really pretty palette
it's perfect for someone who doesn't do
anything that crazy honestly now that
I'm looking at it I feel like this is
very similar to the color pop I love you
palette and I have like very similar
thoughts in the sense that it has this
couple of mattes but then has this like
shimmer lid color so if you were to get
one I honestly would suggest the color
pop so maybe it's time for me to pass
this on this is like way more expensive
quality wise I feel like this is even
better so yeah didn't know I was gonna
say that about it but true it's true and
the other one that I have here is the
mind palette and this is the all matte
palette one of my shadows has like
busted so I have to be kind of careful
there's like a really weird look at it
but this is a pretty palette once again
I feel like this is something that has
been in my collection for a while and I
don't know I just feel like all the
colors they aren't different enough like
they're they're just the same color but
like barely any different so this just
doesn't have enough contrast to me I
think there are better matte palettes
out there at the moment I can't really
tell you but I think you can even buy
singles and just create your own matte
palette for a very similar price
potentially as this one and get more
contrast and just get more use out of it
as well as better quality because I
don't know how much I really love these
shadows next let's talk about one that I
really really love this is the Kevin OH
Quan
electro-pop palette this is pretty dang
tiny but it has so many beautiful colors
in it I got this sent to me from Kevyn
Aucoin from octa Lee and I love it so
much I have a couple different tutorials
and videos using this so I will try to
leave those link down below but oh my
gosh it's just stunning I feel like it
does such a great job of doing color but
also doing some neutrals there are no
mattes in here so you definitely need to
bring those in if that's something that
you really need but I think you can just
create so many fun inspired looks there
are some like fun topper shades in here
that you can pair over the black or pair
over the green and create totally
different looks the formula in here is
an interesting one it's almost like
this.what formula it's very thick but I
find that you know getting it on the eye
you just use your finger and it's
beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
shadows so this is one I highly
recommend I feel like people slept on
this they didn't want to get it and
honestly I would have slept on it too if
I didn't get it sent to me but now that
I have it in my collection it's one that
I really really truly love next let's
talk about the pocket palettes that
really I feel like encompass this entire
idea these are the hoodie Beauty
obsessions palettes I have four of them
before original and then I know there
are two more coming out and they
probably have come out by the time this
videos up I really like these they
retail for $27 which i think is a pretty
decent price because although these are
small I mean they are literally the size
of your hand they have so many shadows
in them they function as a full-on
palette so I I think that the $27 is
worth it when I think about other things
you can get for $25 like let's say the
Too Faced like mini chocolate chip this
is so much better than that you know
what I mean so I'm happy with the price
especially considering that hooda like
bigger palettes are like $65 so you're
really getting a ton of value in this
for $27 for nine shadows this is the
warm Brown obsessions it's all matte
except for that shimmer in the center
the smoky palette is the one that I've
probably used the most I had one of my
shadows crumble some of the formulations
these shimmer shadows is it's beautiful
but they they have a hard time staying
in the pan I think a lot of brands are
having that problem with the really
highly metallic and foiled shadows they
just don't
they're just delicate and fragile next
we have the moth obsessions and this
one's really beautiful as well you can
definitely get some very monochromatic
looks with this palette and then
probably my favorite one not necessarily
want to use the most but the one that
I'm drawn to the most the one that gets
me the most excited is the electric
obsessions and this is very similar to
the electric palette it's like a good
kind of like dupe for it now that that
is technically discontinued these are so
pigmented and really do a great job
translating on the eye so I highly
suggest these pallets I don't think you
need all of them once again get the one
that you know really cost you the most
but I think that these are a really good
value and great quality next let's talk
about the Sigma warm neutrals volume 2
palette this is one that got sent to me
from Sigma and when you look at it it's
just kind of like this basic palette has
some warm shades but then it does have a
couple like just different colors
popping out of it I didn't know how much
I would like this palette and I think
this retails for $40 so I don't think
it's worth the price but I will say that
I have used this more than I thought I
would for me this is one of those
palettes that I like to bring traveling
with me because of the fact that it has
to like mid-tone brown / pink shades for
me to use in my crease it has some nice
shimmers for me to use on a lid has a
darker matte to like deepen up the
crease it has a nice like shimmery
bronze if that's something I want to go
with so it tends to just have everything
I technically need in one place and I
don't have to think about it so I have
traveled with this a couple of different
times so I feel like this is one of
those pellets it's kind of interesting
like I don't necessarily suggest it
because of the price and I know I would
have never paid for it if it hadn't have
been sent to me but at the same time
as much as I don't suggest it I do
actually use this palette I think the
quality is still good in this palette
and it's something actually reach for in
times of need so yeah kind of like a
weird one but I wanted to bring that one
up it's definitely nice and small and
you get twelve shades in here I have two
more brands to talk
the next one I had to bring up the
Smashbox cover shop palettes these are
like so tiny they retail for $25 again I
think that's worth it for all the
different shades you're getting what I
love about these small palettes is they
are the size of a quad but again you're
getting two quads in here this has eight
different shadows in it this is the
ablaze one and it's not an all-in-one
palette for me honestly some of these
tones are a little bit too dark to just
be everyday shadows but I do really like
how much you get in here for the price
unless I wanted to mention these
covergirl ones because again they are
bigger than a quad you get ten shadows
in here and they're kind of the only
drugstore ones that I have and I wanted
to not just only talk about I guess
higher-end ones this is the hot cat and
I do have a whole review on these if you
want to know a little bit more I don't
know how much I love these shadows I
think that they work fine and they
especially work really well with the
covergirl primer and I'm talking about
these shimmers here these are kind of
like a really powdery formula but
they're definitely pigmented so it's
kind of this like weird in-between if
you're looking for something that is
more affordable these are nice this one
is the more neutral one and then if
you're fun and crazy like me and you
want something that has just a little
bit more personality this is the cool
cat one and this is the one I truly like
I think that the shimmers in here are
absolutely beautiful I've created some
really nice looks with this like green
kind of duochrome shade so I do suggest
this one again if you're going to be
using it with a tacky primer you can
really get these shadows to build up
pigmentation nice have a really great
Sparkle and stay on the lid all day if
not there just a little bit powdery so
you know you need the right tools to
make this work but if you can make it
work it's beautiful alright guys so
those are some reviews on some pocket
palettes I was hoping they'd be a little
bit more mini reviews not sure if that
happened but I wanted to just talk about
some little palettes in my collection
some of these you guys have heard about
a ton on my channel and some of these
you really maybe haven't heard about so
I hope you guys enjoyed again let us
know some of your favorite smaller
palettes in the comments
especially if they're drugstore because
I find that I just don't gravitate to
the drugstore pallets very much because
I've tended to be burned by them
I feel like color pop is like a price
range that I think is really affordable
but has great quality and I really would
love to see that in the drugstore but I
don't know if it's there so if there is
something that you really truly love
from the drugstore that has more than
just like four or five shades in it has
some really good quality I would love to
know about those in the comments other
than that thank you guys so so much for
watching I really appreciate it and I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
