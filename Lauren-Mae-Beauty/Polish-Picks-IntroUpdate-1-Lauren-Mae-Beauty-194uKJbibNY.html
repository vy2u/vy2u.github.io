Lauren this is going to be a new type of
video for my channel I got this idea
from Maddie or curious sparkles here on
YouTube I absolutely love her I will
leave her channel wind down below out of
hell is just checking her out I saw her
do a video called polished pics and it's
kind of a different take than project
polish which is like using your polishes
up instead this is focused on trying out
the different polishes in your
collection and making sure that they all
suit you that you like them that the
formula is good and that just the polish
that you do have that you've all tried
at least once and you know work for you
I have little my nail polish collection
down so much I've decluttered I recently
sent the nails all things over to love
Heatherette like I am trying so hard and
I feel like I'm at the place where I
don't want to clutter anything anymore
until I know it doesn't work for me I
honestly have so many nail polishes I
don't know how many have I should
probably count them and I honestly am on
and off again about painting my nails
but I feel like this project is fits me
better than projects polish did I
supposed to know that project just like
bombed for me I'm assembly not like I
don't want to do something like I'm just
not going to do it and I can be kind of
stubborn and I make these videos
sometimes to give me that extra push to
use that product and to read and stuff
and sometimes when it's nail polish or
books and I just are not very good at it
and yeah it doesn't go very well so
hoping this can be a way to motivate
myself in terms of not having to use as
an entire nail polish bottle which can
be difficult for me because I want to
try new colors and do different things
so I'm hoping that this will be kind of
a better fit for me I can go through my
collection see if I like stuff and get
rid of stuff that doesn't work on me and
I know doesn't work on me because I just
read it on and i don't want to pay my
nails with it again anyway this is going
to be my intro for this in kind of like
her video it's also my update I have
already gone through ten nail polishes
this year I've been painting them on my
nails trying the malware and then and
have some thoughts on is there a few
that i wanted to clutter and I'm kind of
just realizing what i like the most from
my nail polishes and that's also helping
like what I gravitate to and what I
really enjoy on my nails so anyway
without further ado let's just get into
it
if anything else comes out on the top
we'll talk about it then the birds
polish that I remember wearing this year
like a 20-17 was this one from SD and
this is called boom boom boom it's like
this mix between a neon hot pink / a
baby pink I will say I don't necessarily
love Essie's brush it's kind of tiny but
I absolutely love this palette
definitely keeping looks like a whole
trash delivery thing going on right now
well i hope that on delivering trash I
hope it's like really like they're
taking it away they're delivering us
from trash maybe I think that the trash
guys like far enough away or we can
continue this without being interrupted
anyway I don't particularly love at
these nail polish brushes I prefer a
larger brush but this polish told was on
really nice this is a me color I love
past Kelly types of colors that are
cream I really love cream formulas and
realizing and this is just like so fun i
love this i cannot wait to wear this
more definitely a really good one i did
get this out Marshall I thought it was
over it's not hopefully hers can't hear
it's like what I'm hoping in my head but
I have a feeling anyway I really like
this we're gonna move on to the other
polishes cuz we got a lot to talk about
highly suggested so if I can find it on
Amazon I'll leave a link down below I
always try for you guys next we have two
polishes that I actually wore together
they're both china glaze which i don't
particularly love China Glaze this
formula if I just find that it's hips I
just don't like it I feel like they're
really inexpensive and I can usually
find them for cheaper than a lot of the
other politicians in my collection but I
just I don't know there's something was
a formula the colors are pretty but when
I could the Roman nails it just don't
like it and if you like that about these
so the first one here is son of the
peach beautiful neon it's kind of just
bleep neon type of color I have used a
lot of this as well I think we're down
to here in the bottle which is pretty
good for me again I have a lot of
polishes to go through so for something
to have that much we're on it that's
pretty good this is so streaky this
takes like at least three coats to get
opaque and even then the brush
constantly wet soy products at the base
of mail it is so tricky to put on I do
and
liking the color especially when it's by
itself but it's definitely not worth it
it's one of those polishes that because
you have to layer it so much it gets
gummy it never dries you have to like to
walk around with your hands like this
for forever because it hasn't dried in
between coats and even though your top
codes on antioch so me touchin trying to
wrinkle not like it's not worth it it's
just not worth it I'm sad because they
truly do like this color but I just
don't feel like the formula is good
enough to keep this and I am finally
realizing that I just not worth it to me
I don't want to wear this just cuz it's
pretty in the bottle does not mean it is
worth it and I'm getting rid of it as
for this this is a glitter and isn't
it's called glitter goblin I believe
it's part of a Halloween collection it's
really pretty it's a orange glitter
mixed with a holographic glitter they're
all at once eyes it looks beautiful in
the bottle I thought that this would
somehow be acute combination this is the
moment I realized what I do prefer cream
formula there are glitters that i love
but for the most part i just like a
cream finish anyway room a manicure
because i put this on over top of this
only a couple meals but I was like sting
it I regret this decision immediately
and then on top of that this glitter
just looked like a dirt on my meals I
was actually wearing this combination
for my birthday which really sucks
because I thought it was hideous yeah
yeah I just wasn't cute the dark colored
orange glitter in this again just don't
realize the light they aren't fun they
aren't cute it just looks like dirt
there's nothing else to say I don't like
this glitter I'm going to be passing it
on to someone else as much as it's sad
I'm happy to have had that experience so
I can pass these on and they're not
sitting in my collection I know if I
didn't try those out I would just keep
them in my collection because in the
bottle they look so pretty but it is not
practical and I just have so many other
things that I love it's not worth it
next to have more polishes that are all
from lime crime i bought these awesome
of all cosmetics wholesale a long time
ago I feel like probably at least three
it's not four years ago for a really
long time
been like my absolute favorite purple
this is the color lavender e I am like
down to here on it once again that's a
big thing for me absolutely love this
color the formula on these are
absolutely beautiful trying out these
different polishes made me realize how
much I don't like that kind of is one
because these go on Oh pink in one coat
I always do at least two coats because I
just feel weird to put one colored nail
polish on my nails but honestly I
wouldn't really need to with these their
sin they dry easy they're just beautiful
the color is beautiful they don't stain
my nails I know a lot of people aren't
into line crime so you know I don't know
if I was repurchasing but I definitely
enjoy them and if you were interested at
least the ones i have are an amazing
formula so I do love these I'm going to
be keeping all the ones i have so again
Lavin dairy I have this orange which is
called peaches and cream I know it
business similar enough to the title is
one that I could be totally happy with
this one this one's called once in a
blue moose and I really like this color
absolutely beautiful in my last set of
videos I was wearing this so if you want
to see it in action highly suggested and
it didn't stain my fingers blue I do the
base coat but still that's like amazing
really like this and then the pink one
which again is so pretty because I love
pink actually wore with a glitter but
this one is in the color parfait day and
I was wearing it with this glitter from
butter london in tart with a heart i
absolutely love this glitter is so
pretty it's probably my favorite glitter
is over you i did have this in a
favorites video last year and a fan by
that I still love it so this just has
such a pretty mix of glitters or
different sizes there holotropic they
shine like green and purple in a really
light light pink face it's just great
and it just made me realize that this is
a great glitter and that other glitter
stuck so keep in this love it I have two
neurologists to talk about I don't think
I mention this in the beginning but
every time I try out pending polishes is
what I'm going to do an update so it
won't be necessarily monthly it'll be
based on how often I'm wearing polish it
has been
I'm at 7i might just do one but that's
kind of how I'm running it because I
session is running it I think it sounds
good next polish that I war is a classic
this is the sally hansen pacific blue
this exact color I don't think they make
it anymore I decided to try this out
because I know this is like a fan
favorite everyone loves it and I
remember truly loving this but I wanted
to give it a try and make sure since
it's been a long time since I wore it I
love it it's such a pretty color I love
that it's a cream finish this is just an
interesting color of blue to wear on the
nails I also felt like this war a super
long time I wore this one for like at
least five or six days and there was no
chipping it was just wearing away on the
fingertips which I thought was amazing I
really like that one not sure if we can
get it again hopefully I can find on
amazon for you guys and the last polish
that i have to talk about an on the
fence about it's what i'm wearing on my
nails today and it's rude ever Lippmann
this is do the mermaid and I picked this
up when i was working at my beauty store
when i was reading because I got thirty
percent off and it was also a limited
edition color since we had one less and
I want to get it i've been wanting it
for the whole time I've been working
here I love this in the bottle and super
pretty but it's more of like this Ashley
toned lavender instead of a warmer
lavender which is what i typically go
for its built up to like three layers
right now which it took a little bit of
time I feel like it drives decently well
bail for having that many layers so
definitely wasn't pupae like that china
glaze 1 i'm just hard I'm not for the
success of it like I thought it would be
I think it looks okay so this is one run
of tigers on a sense about i'm going to
try out some other colors similar to it
maybe try it over polish and see if it's
better as like a topper since it is more
of a like semi-sheer glitter type of
polish and deceit I can make it work in
a certain way because I do like it I'm
just on the fence I'm not as in love
with it and I thought it would be so
kind of sad so we'll put this on the
mainland I thought I would just show you
like see the difference this is so much
warmer than this this is just like a
gray purple I was just trouble
this even without the glitter and I'm
excited to kind of go through my
polishes figure out what works for me
and what doesn't I'm surprised at the
findings I already found out about in
this just you know first ten polishes so
I can't wait to see what else I have in
my collection how I feel about it and I
think this would just be a better fit
for me so hopefully I can keep up to
date with this and continue to paint my
nails I love the way my nails were
painted and I'm getting better at
painting on now that I think them more
often I don't have as much like on the
side which feels amazing anyway that's
enough talk about polishes for today I
hope you guys are having a wonderful
rest of your day and I will see you in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
