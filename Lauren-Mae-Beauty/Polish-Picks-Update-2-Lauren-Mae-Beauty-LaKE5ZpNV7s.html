learn thanks so much for watching today
I have an update for you on my projects
polished now I got this idea from Maggie
or serious Sparkle trm youtube and I
also recently found out that Laura from
PG team is also doing this so i will
have bulbs on the links down below if
you want to check them out what i really
like about this nail polish project is
that it's different than projects polish
where we're not trying to finish up the
whole entire bottle of polish but
instead going through our collection
trying to find which polishes look good
honest and not least use everything once
so that we can go through our collection
and declutter what is it all good what
formulas suck and so on and so forth so
i have six polishes that I've gone
through so let's get into it and I'll
show you what I've used in what I think
about it the first polish but I picked
up to use was China glazes highlight of
my summer this is a kind of bleach neon
I guess you could say it's like a pastel
green but super neon I really like the
way just looked on the nails Sam also
really liked it it isn't the best neon
formula but it isn't the worst it took
me three coats to build up but I did
like it enough that i am going to be
keeping it I don't feel like I have
anything in my collection that's really
similar to it either so that's why I'm
going to keep it as well it was really
pretty and I'm excited to use it more
during summer the next polish that I
wore this month or you know energy I
don't want to call our month because
it's like not really going by month it's
just whenever I want to update you guys
but anyway this next one here is from SE
this is your Hut or mine I believe this
is from some type of limited-edition
collection that came out probably a long
time ago this is such a pretty rosy
color I almost feel like this could be
like a grandma color and there's
something about it that's really
understand is but still so pretty I
really enjoyed this more than I thought
I would and I also got a lot more
compliments than I thought I would in
real life and also from you guys it also
have like a sheen to it it's very subtle
it's still like translates kind of like
a cream on your nails so the sparkles
not too much or you know it doesn't make
it look tacky or anything I really
and if you could like find her somewhere
I think it's a really interesting polish
I don't feel like I have a ton of stuff
is like dusty rose like this color is I
realize that a lot of my stuff is
following the same theme I did like
greens and rose tones so the next two
polishes I war I actually we're together
so this one here is or Alize rage I
wanted to bust this out because I
remember there was a toe on YouTube when
everyone was orally grades it was all
the rage if you will I thought that I
wouldn't like this that much but this is
so pretty I reckon it's really good I
really do feel like everyone liked it
because there's a reason you're looking
for a rose gold polish I really do think
this is a great one it just looks so
nice on the nails and I am really happy
to rediscover this in my collection and
then the color I paragraph it was from
butter london and this is called rosie
lee it's just a glitter these two
polishes looks okay together they
weren't like the best combination ever
it wasn't a stellar combination on my
part but I thought it looked ok together
and this one by itself is still really
pretty so I'm going to be trying this
out with other polishes I still really
like it I think it's a nice dense
glitter and I think the colors
absolutely beautiful I am a sucker for
pink I have another butter london polish
this one is called bossy boots in it's a
pistachio green color this is a crimson
edge with red lab and this is not going
to be the polish for everyone it's
definitely kind of interesting it's a
spring polish but it's a little bit more
muted so if you're wanting almost like a
neutral green spring color I suggest
this but it's a little more like high
fashion color neutral I don't know I
don't even know if that makes sense but
I did really enjoy this I felt like the
formula was really nice to skate on my
nails quite a while I'm really glad to
use a couple butter london nail polishes
this time around because they are kind
of expensive and i bought so many of
them at one time I remember the site has
like thirty percent off and I went crazy
and bought so many because I thought
that was such a good deal and I looked
back and was like I was like when did I
have that much money can I have it back
like oops meeting wait money can and I
have that I don't know where was putting
all his money from but
girl you best believe i was buying some
mad like i had makeup coming to me every
day every day it was Christmas every day
at my mom's house anyway I digress the
last polish I have here is her messy and
it's what i'm wearing on my nails today
i've been wearing this for a while now
and it's been holding up really well
this is Essie's tin chili it's a classic
color from se I really like this color
on the nail I think it looks really nice
it's a nice gray it's a korean formula
it's not too dark I don't feel like to
rock or anything in this great polish
but the formula is not the best when
you're putting it on its the first coat
super sheer I did build this up to three
coats on my nails so I'm going to keep
this for now but if I find a color very
similar in my collection that I can get
with two coats I might toss this along I
just don't want to have to do three
coats with my polishes I don't have the
time for that and I find I found that
when you put three coats on you just run
the risk of it getting really goopy
really fast we've all had this happen
where you put the top coat on because
you think it's dry enough and then you
actually touch it and the top layers dry
but underneath is like I don't even know
it starts crinkling and wrinkling up
yeah I like to avoid that as much as
possible so I like to keep it you know a
to coat or if I fans anyway that will be
going into the maybe pile I will have
all of my like statistics on my nail
polishes like how many has gone through
how many and made pile and all that
let's go down below if you're interested
other than that so that's everything for
this video guys this video's reminding
me I definitely should paint my nails a
different color tonight so that's
everything I'll see you my next video
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
